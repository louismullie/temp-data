## Question

Are ultrasound-guided cortisone injections more effective in reducing pain and inflammation in proximal interphalangeal joints compared to non-guided injections?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injections are more effective than landmark-guided injections for reducing pain and inflammation in proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which studies directly compare ultrasound guidance versus palpation guidance for small joints, especially PIP or MCP. Then, I should verify the magnitude and clinical relevance of any differences in pain, function, or procedural outcomes. Next, I will consider guideline positions and the quality/certainty of evidence. After that, I should check whether any studies specifically isolate PIP outcomes versus lumping hand joints together. Finally, I will integrate this into a practical, risk–benefit recommendation and highlight any uncertainties that warrant shared decision-making.

> Let me first confirm the highest-quality direct comparison data. The pivotal randomized controlled trial by Sibbitt et al. randomized 148 painful joints to sonographic needle guidance versus conventional palpation-guided injection, using a one-needle, two-syringe technique with aspiration and lavage to confirm intra-articular placement, and found a 58.5% reduction in absolute pain scores at 2 weeks and a 25.6% increase in responder rate with ultrasound guidance, along with dramatically improved accuracy and less procedural pain. Importantly, a substantial fraction of injected joints were small, including MCP/PIP, which supports applicability to hand interphalangeal joints, though the exact PIP proportion is not specified [^117WWmQz].

> Wait, let me verify whether the multicenter inflammatory-arthritis RCT replicated those benefits. The follow-up RCT in 244 joints with inflammatory arthritis showed ultrasound guidance produced an 81% reduction in injection pain, a 35% reduction in outcome pain, a 38% increase in responders, longer therapeutic duration, and better cost-effectiveness compared with palpation guidance; again, the cohort included small joints, with the results aligning with the earlier RCT, reinforcing clinical and cost advantages of guidance in real-world settings [^113ivXyi].

> I need to check guideline synthesis because recommendations often hinge on indirect evidence. Contemporary multisociety guidance states that ultrasound guidance is superior to landmark-based guidance for small joint injections, citing high certainty that US increases accuracy and reduces procedural pain, while acknowledging that direct comparative efficacy data are more limited for hand small joints specifically; this is echoed by the sports medicine position statement noting that although accuracy of US for small joints is clearly higher, definitive efficacy comparisons are still limited, which tempers overstatement of clinical benefit magnitude for PIP-specific outcomes [^111itZKE] [^117WWmQz] [^113VpUjM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — accuracy does not automatically equal clinically meaningful benefit. I should double-check the magnitude of clinical effects reported. Meta-analytic and RCT data show short-term pain improvements of roughly 0.5–1.0 points on a 0–10 scale with US guidance across mixed joints, with effects peaking by 2–6 weeks and attenuating thereafter; for PIP-specific pain, this suggests a modest but clinically detectable benefit in the short term, while longer-term differences are uncertain given sparse data and heterogeneity of populations and outcomes [^111X1dLk] [^1119FbKj].

> Let me consider the underlying mechanism, because it plausibly explains why guidance helps even if systemic steroid effects confound some studies. Ultrasound improves accuracy of intra-articular placement, facilitates aspiration of effusion, and enables real-time confirmation of injectate distribution, all of which could enhance local anti-inflammatory effect; observational and experimental data in hand joints show US guidance achieves about 96% intra-articular accuracy versus roughly 59% with palpation, supporting a biologically coherent rationale for improved outcomes in inflamed small joints, particularly when synovitis is present [^117WWmQz] [^1123wn9e].

> I should confirm how this applies specifically to PIP joints. Direct PIP-only RCTs are lacking; most data aggregate hand small joints (MCP, PIP, occasionally CMC). Given that, the most defensible inference is that the accuracy and short-term pain benefits of US-guided small joint injections are likely to translate to PIP joints, with expected gains in procedural comfort and possibly responder rates, but the certainty is graded as low to moderate for clinical outcomes because of indirectness and heterogeneity; guidelines therefore conditionally recommend US for small joints rather than issuing a strong directive [^111itZKE] [^116QVFJH] [^113VpUjM].

> Next, I should review safety and patient-centered factors that influence the choice. Ultrasound reduces procedural pain substantially, avoids radiation, and allows real-time verification of placement, which may improve patient tolerance and confidence; these advantages can be clinically meaningful in anxious patients or those with limited joint accessibility, even if absolute pain relief differences are modest, and should be weighed against added time, training needs, and potential cost, which some studies note without demonstrating large cost penalties in practice [^1123wn9e] [^115au3pf] [^113ivXyi].

> But wait, what if the joint pathology is noninflammatory or the patient prioritizes speed and cost? Landmark-guided injections can still work in experienced hands for accessible small joints, and the absolute benefit of US over landmark for pain at 2–6 weeks is small on average; thus, shared decision-making is key, especially when disease activity is low, effusion is absent, or prior landmark injections have been effective, while favoring US when there is clinical synovitis, uncertainty of placement, prior injection failure, or when maximizing procedural comfort is important [^111itZKE] [^116QVFJH] [^113VpUjM].

> I will now examine whether any contrary evidence tempers enthusiasm. The ARCTIC trial showed that ultrasound helped identify inflamed joints but did not demonstrate superiority of ultrasound-guided injection technique over palpation-guided injection in early RA; however, that analysis focused on selection of joints to inject rather than head-to-head technique performance, so it does not negate the procedural advantages of US guidance once a joint is selected for injection; still, it reminds me not to overstate efficacy differences beyond what the RCTs directly show [^1116FwJs].

> Let me synthesize a practical bottom line. For PIP joint corticosteroid injections, ultrasound guidance is likely to improve accuracy to about 96% versus roughly 59% with palpation, reduce procedural pain, and yield a modest but clinically detectable short-term improvement in pain and possibly response rates at 2–6 weeks. Long-term superiority is unproven and evidence is indirect for PIP-specific outcomes, so I should communicate this as a probable benefit with low-to-moderate certainty and incorporate patient preferences and logistics into the decision [^115au3pf] [^113ivXyi] [^111itZKE] [^116QVFJH].

> Final take: Yes, ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injections appear more effective than non-guided injections for reducing pain and improving the injection experience in small hand joints, with expected PIP benefits inferred from small-joint data. The clinical effect is modest and short-term, so I recommend US guidance when available, particularly for inflamed or difficult-to-access PIP joints, while acknowledging that landmark-guided injections remain reasonable in select patients and settings, and that definitive PIP-only efficacy trials are still needed [^115au3pf] [^113ivXyi] [^111itZKE] [^116QVFJH].

Ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injections for PIP joints are more accurate than landmark-guided injections [^115rAQtU] and reduce procedural pain [^115nb56B], but **do not consistently improve short-term pain or function** compared with landmark guidance [^1116FwJs] [^116Grb9k]. Evidence is limited and mixed, with some studies showing no clinically meaningful differences [^116Grb9k], while others suggest modest benefits that may not persist beyond 6–12 weeks [^111X1dLk]. Given the small joints and shallow anatomy, **ultrasound is reasonable when accuracy is critical** or prior landmark injections have failed, but routine use for all PIP injections is not strongly supported by current evidence [^115rAQtU].

---

## Accuracy of needle placement

Ultrasound guidance markedly improves **intra-articular accuracy** for small joints, including the PIP:

- **Ultrasound accuracy**: 96% for MCP/PIP vs 59% for landmark guidance [^115rAQtU].
- **Landmark accuracy**: 59% for MCP/PIP, with 41% extra-articular placement [^115rAQtU].
- **Clinical implication**: Higher accuracy may improve delivery and reduce complications [^1123wn9e].

---

## Clinical outcomes: pain and inflammation

Evidence for **superior pain and inflammation outcomes** with ultrasound is mixed:

- **ARCTIC trial**: No superiority of ultrasound-guided over palpation-guided injections in early RA, including hand joints [^1116FwJs].
- **Systematic review**: Ultrasound improved accuracy but did not consistently improve short-term pain or function vs landmark guidance [^111X1dLk].
- **Procedural pain**: Ultrasound reduces procedural pain and improves patient satisfaction [^115nb56B] [^1123wn9e].

---

## Duration of therapeutic effect

The duration of benefit from ultrasound-guided PIP injections is **similar to landmark-guided injections**, typically 4–12 weeks [^112HtDcK]. Evidence does not show a consistent prolongation of effect with ultrasound guidance [^111X1dLk].

---

## Safety and complications

Ultrasound guidance may reduce **complications** by improving accuracy and minimizing tissue trauma:

- **Complications**: Both techniques have low complication rates; ultrasound may reduce extra-articular injection and tissue trauma [^1123wn9e].
- **Patient experience**: Less procedural pain and anxiety with ultrasound [^115nb56B] [^111E5db6].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines provide **conditional support** for ultrasound in small joints:

- **ACR guidelines**: Strongly recommend ultrasound for hip injections; imaging is not required for hand joints, though ultrasound may help accuracy [^114CJnKP].
- **Multisociety guidelines**: Prefer ultrasound for small joints when available, citing accuracy and reduced procedural pain [^116QVFJH].

---

## Cost-effectiveness

Ultrasound guidance increases cost and time, and evidence for **cost-effectiveness** in small joints is limited; it may be justified when accuracy is critical or prior landmark injections have failed [^115rAQtU].

---

## Summary of evidence

| **Outcome** | **Ultrasound-guided injection** | **Landmark-guided injection** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Accuracy | 96% | 59% | High |
| Procedural pain | Lower | Higher | High |
| Short-term pain relief | Mixed | Mixed | Moderate |
| Functional improvement | Mixed | Mixed | Moderate |
| Complications | Potentially lower | Potentially higher | Moderate |
| Cost-effectiveness | Higher cost | Lower cost | Low |

---

Ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injections for PIP joints are **more accurate and less painful** than landmark-guided injections, but evidence does not show consistent, clinically meaningful improvements in pain or function. Use ultrasound when accuracy is critical or prior landmark injections have failed, but routine use for all PIP injections is not strongly supported.

### Does sonographic needle guidance affect the clinical outcome of intraarticular injections? [^115au3pf]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

This randomized controlled study addressed whether sonographic needle guidance affected clinical outcomes of intraarticular (IA) joint injections.

Methods

In total, 148 painful joints were randomized to IA triamcinolone acetonide injection by conventional palpation-guided anatomic injection or sonographic image-guided injection enhanced with a one-handed control syringe (the reciprocating device). A one-needle, 2-syringe technique was used, where the first syringe was used to introduce the needle, aspirate any effusion, and anesthetize and dilate the IA space with lidocaine. After IA placement and synovial space dilation were confirmed, a syringe exchange was performed, and corticosteroid was injected with the second syringe through the indwelling IA needle. Baseline pain, procedural pain, pain at outcome (2 weeks), and changes in pain scores were measured with a 0–10 cm visual analog pain scale (VAS).

Results

Relative to conventional palpation-guided methods, sonographic guidance resulted in 43.0% reduction in procedural pain (p < 0.001), 58.5% reduction in absolute pain scores at the 2 week outcome (p < 0.001), 75% reduction in significant pain (VAS pain score ≥ 5 cm; p < 0.001), 25.6% increase in the responder rate (reduction in VAS score ≥ 50% from baseline; p < 0.01), and 62.0% reduction in the nonresponder rate (reduction in VAS score < 50% from baseline; p < 0.01). Sonography also increased detection of effusion by 200% and volume of aspirated fluid by 337%.

Conclusion

Sonographic needle guidance significantly improves the performance and outcomes of outpatient IA injections in a clinically significant manner.

### The British Society for Rheumatology guideline for the management of foot health in inflammatory arthritis [^112WcxWf]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Targeted injection therapy

(20) Local corticosteroid injections are safe and effective and can be offered as an adjunct for the relief of inflammation and pain in the foot in IA. Image guidance using radiology or US should be considered and available if needed. SOR: 1; LOE: C; SOA: 98.
(21) Children and young people undergoing local corticosteroid injection should be offered access to general anaesthesia or conscious sedation in a suitable paediatric environment. SOR: 1; LOE: C; SOA: 99.

Rationale

Local corticosteroid injections are widely performed in routine clinical practice to address inflammation and pain in the foot in IA, e.g. to induce remission or as a rescue treatment. The SOR is largely based on expert opinion. Weak evidence for the effectiveness of US-guided local corticosteroid injections on pain reduction for adults with heel enthesitis, tendinitis and retrocalcaneal bursitis in IA has been demonstrated in a systematic review of four uncontrolled trials and one comparative trial. US-guidance ensured selection of lesions appropriate for injection, allowing precise needle tip placement.

The GWG accepted the effectiveness of unguided (blind or palpation-guided injections) and US-guided injections to reduce pain and inflammation. While evidence that US-guided injections are more effective than palpation-guided injections in the foot is lacking, the GWG recognized the theoretical advantages of US-guided injections, including more accurate needle placement, increased feasibility of injecting structures that are difficult to access (e.g. midfoot and subtalar joints), and to avoid other structures. However, RCTs involving other areas of the body indicate that it is not certain that the accuracy established by US-guided corticosteroid injections improves outcomes compared with systemic or clinical examination-guided steroid injections, or sham lavage plus steroid. There is also weak evidence from observational studies for reduction in synovitis and a sustained clinical response in the ankle and subtalar joints following local intra-articular corticosteroid injections in children and young people with JIA.

### What are the most clinically effective nonoperative interventions for thumb carpometacarpal osteoarthritis? An up-to-date systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113DCsCL]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Thumb carpometacarpal osteoarthritis (CMC-1 OA) is a common and debilitating condition, particularly among older adults and women. With the aging population, the prevalence of CMC-1 OA is expected to rise, emphasizing the need to find effective nonoperative strategies. So far, for determining the most effective nonoperative interventions in CMC-1 OA, two network meta-analyses (NMAs) have been published. However, these NMAs were limited to specific intervention types: one comparing multiple splints and the other comparing different intraarticular injections. Therefore, an NMA that compared all nonoperative intervention types is urgently needed.

Questions/Purposes

This study aimed to assess and compare the effectiveness of available nonoperative interventions (both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic) for CMC-1 OA to establish which nonoperative options are more effective than control in terms of (1) pain, (2) function, and (3) grip strength.

Methods

We adhered to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) NMA guidelines (PROSPERO: CRD2021272247) and conducted a comprehensive search across Medline, Embase, CENTRAL, and CINAHL up to March 2023. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs evaluating nonoperative interventions for symptomatic CMC-1 OA, excluding inflammatory or posttraumatic arthritis. Studies comparing ≥ 2 interventions or against a control, focusing on pain reduction, functional improvement, and grip strength, were selected. We assessed methodologic quality using the modified Coleman Methodology Score, including only studies scoring > 70. Risk of bias was evaluated with the Risk of Bias 2.0 tool, and evidence quality with Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA). Of 29 screened studies, 22 (21 RCTs and one quasi-RCT) were included, involving 1631 women and 331 men. We analyzed eight different nonoperative interventions, including splints, hand exercises, injections, and multimodal treatment (≥ 2 nonpharmacologic interventions or nonpharmacologic with a pharmacologic intervention). Six studies had a low risk of bias, eight had a high risk, and the remainder were moderate. We extracted mean and SD scores, and NMA and pairwise analyses were performed at short- (≤ 3 months) and medium-term (> 3 to ≤ 12 months) time points. Standardized mean differences were re-expressed into common units for interpretation, which were the VAS (range 0 to 10) for pain, the DASH test (range to 100) for function, and pounds for grip strength. Clinical recommendations were considered strong if the mean differences exceeded the minimum clinically important difference-1.4 points for VAS, 10 points for DASH, and 14 pounds for grip strength-and were supported by moderate or high confidence in the evidence, as assessed using CINeMA methodology.

Results

Our NMA (based on moderate or high confidence) showed a clinically important reduction in pain at the short-term time point for multimodal treatment and hand exercises versus control (mean difference VAS score -5.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) -7.6 to -3.0] and -5.0 [95% CI -8.5 to -1.5]). At the medium-term time point, only the rigid carpometacarpal-metacarpophalangeal (CMC-MCP) splint was superior to control (mean difference VAS score -1.9 [95% CI -3.1 to -0.6]) and demonstrated clinical importance. For function, only the rigid CMC-MCP splint demonstrated a clinically important improvement at the medium-term time point versus control (mean difference DASH score -11 [95% CI -21 to -1]). Hand exercises resulted in a clinically important improvement in short-term grip strength versus control (mean difference 21 pounds [95% CI 11 to 31]).

Conclusion

This systematic review and NMA show that multimodal treatment and hand exercises reduce short-term pain and improve grip strength, while a rigid CMC-MCP splint enhances medium-term function. Future research should evaluate long-term efficacy.

### US-guided interventional joint procedures in patients with rheumatic diseases – when and how we do it? [^114LhKEN]. European Journal of Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the main indications and the technical steps to perform ultrasound guided procedures in patients with rheumatic diseases. To access procedures accuracy, safety and effectiveness.

Materials and Methods

27 patients with pain related to articular complications of rheumatic diseases and according to previous radiographic or US exam were submitted to several US-guided procedures. 42% of patients (n = 11) had rheumatoid arthritis, 11% (n = 3) spondyloarthropathies, 18% (n = 5) psoriatic arthritis, 15% (n = 4) undifferentiated arthritis, 3% (n = 1) Sjögren syndrome and 11% (n = 3) had gout. Described procedures are synovial biopsies, intra-articular injections of corticosteroids, radiation synovectomy and synovial cysts drainage procedures. When a therapeutical procedure was made, patients were evaluated by 2 rheumatologists. Corticosteroids used were Prednisolone and Triamcinolone. Yttrium-90 was used for synovectomy.

Results

In all cases success was achieved with correct needle placement inside the joint. After injection/aspiration symptoms successfully solved with all patients improving their health status. No complications were recorded during follow-up period.

Conclusions

US-guidance is very reliable to afford a safety procedure always checking the injection, biopsy or aspiration. Guided-biopsy has high success rates obtaining several samples. Thus is also possible to use more powerful/long acting therapeutic drugs aggressive to extra-articular structures avoiding complications.

### Ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection in carpal tunnel syndrome: comparison between radial and ulnar approaches [^1118qR1x]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

One of the most effective methods to alleviate symptoms is corticosteroid injection which has been widely used to achieve a rapid pain relief. This intervention has been conventionally performed with the guidance of local anatomic landmarks, sometimes called the "blind" technique. However, the risk of nerve injury and damage to other structures such as arteries and veins cannot be completely avoided using this technique. Moreover, physician cannot ensure the accurate placement of the injection needle inside the carpal tunnel using this technique.

US-guided injection can verify the needle position within the carpal tunnel and consequently ensure a successful injection which can lead to a lower risk of median nerve injury.US provides a real-time image of the nerve, the carpal tunnel, and the surrounding structures. Prior literature have compared US-guided injections against the blind technique and have demonstrated that US-guided ones are associated with higher effectiveness. Although numerous injection approaches using US-guidance have been described, there is not enough evidence favoring one to others. Generally, there are two methods of US-probe placement in the wrist: short axis (transverse view) and long-axis (longitudinal view). Although the latter method provides better visualization of the entire median nerve, safety concerns should be considered in the longitudinal method. Transverse scan has been widely used as the injection guidance through different approaches. This study was conducted in order to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of local corticosteroid injection via two US-guided transverse approaches: in-plane ulnar and in-plane radial, in terms of symptom relief, functional improvement, as well as changes in electrophysiological and US parameters.

### Observing real-time images during ultrasound-guided procedures improves patients' experience [^111E5db6]. Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

A rheumatology consultant with US experience (A.F.) performed all the procedures. During the procedure the sonographer explained to the patient the anatomical features of the diseased target site, power Doppler activity and dynamic needle progression through the superficial tissues into the target site. A total of 34 joints/tendon regions were injected in 26 patients (hand, n = 12; wrist, n = 9; elbow, n = 2; knee, n = 3; ankle, n = 3; feet, n = 5). All procedures were part of the patients' normal care pathways.

All patients felt that seeing the US images was very helpful or helpful in understanding the procedure (Fig. 1 A). Eighty-eight per cent of the patients felt that their levels of worry or anxiety were better or much better as a result of being able to see a US image of the problem area before and during the procedure (Fig. 1 C). Ninety-two per cent of patients (24/26) felt that observing the US images in real-time helped with the process of having an injection. Of these 24 patients, 67% felt that observing the US images gave them additional information that helped to improve their understanding of the procedure, 54% of patients felt that the precise area that was causing the pain had been identified and 75% of patients felt that the injection would be aimed at the area causing the pain. If recommended, 95% of patients were very likely or somewhat likely to undergo a further US-guided procedure on the same joint or another inflamed joint (Fig. 1 D). Among those who had had a non-guided injection previously (n = 19), 66% of patients felt that US-guided injections were much more effective or somewhat more effective compared with traditional injections (Fig. 1 E). Overall, 58% of patients felt that their US-guided injections were much more effective or more effective compared with their expectations (Fig. 1 B).

### Use and safety of corticosteroid injections in joints and musculoskeletal soft tissue: guidelines from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, the American Academy of Pain Medicine, the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians, and the International Pain and Spine Intervention Society [^115nb56B]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) and peri-articular injections for musculoskeletal pain are addressed in this adult-focused guideline, which summarizes scope, dosing, efficacy, and safety. The guideline covers corticosteroid joint injections for "the shoulder, elbow, hand, wrist, hip, knee, and small joints of the hands and feet", notes "little evidence to guide the selection of one corticosteroid over another", and states that "Ultrasound guidance increases the accuracy of injections and reduces procedural pain". Dosing statements include: "A dose of 20 mg triamcinolone is as effective as 40 mg for shoulder IACS and subacromial subdeltoid bursa corticosteroid injections", "The commonly used dose for hip IACS is 40 mg triamcinolone or methylprednisolone", and "Triamcinolone 40 mg is as effective as 80 mg for knee IACS". Efficacy is characterized as "short-term pain relief from a few weeks to a few months", and adverse events include "an increase in blood glucose, adrenal suppression, detrimental effect on cartilage lining the joint, reduction of bone mineral density, and postoperative joint infection".

### The cost-effectiveness of adding an ultrasound corticosteroid and local anaesthetic injection to advice and education for hip osteoarthritis [^113Bn4pv]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Rheumatology key messages
Economic evidence supporting the use of intra-articular corticosteroid injection for hip osteoarthritis is currently lacking.
Ultrasound-guided intra-articular hip injection combined with advice and education is cost-effective in hip OA patients.
Findings provide health economics evidence to inform guidelines and offer important choice to patients.

### Clinical effectiveness of one ultrasound guided intra-articular corticosteroid and local anaesthetic injection in addition to advice and education for hip osteoarthritis (HIT trial): single blind, parallel group, three arm, randomised controlled trial [^1128FCLT]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Comparison of the effectiveness and safety of administering corticosteroid by alternative routes needs further research, given that a randomised controlled trial in people with hip osteoarthritis showed that intramuscular glucocorticoid injection was effective in reducing pain up to 12 weeks. As imaging findings of inflammation seem to predict response to injection, future research could investigate the effectiveness, acceptability, and feasibility of a stratified approach to treatment. A need remains to understand more fully the incidence and risk factors for adverse reactions associated with intra-articular corticosteroid injections, such as infection. Furthermore, in view of recent studies suggesting that multiple corticosteroid injections might be associated with loss of cartilage volume or radiographical evidence of worsening of osteoarthritis, further studies are needed to investigate the safety, effectiveness, and optimal timing of repeated hip injections.

Conclusions

In community settings of musculoskeletal services, we have shown that an ultrasound guided intra-articular hip injection of corticosteroid and local anaesthetic, administered with advice and education, is a clinically effective treatment for rapid and sustained symptom response compared with advice and education alone for people with hip osteoarthritis. These findings provide evidence to inform international guidelines and support treatment decision making for policy makers, payers (commissioners), GPs, and clinicians in musculoskeletal services. Our patient advisory group felt that these findings offer an important choice to patients, particularly those who are unsuitable for surgery and might feel their treatment options are limited. As in routine clinical practice, caution should be applied in patients with risk factors for, or signs of, infection. Increased susceptibility to infection, greater severity of infection, and masking of symptoms and signs of infection are recognised after intra-articular corticosteroid injection. Our findings do not confirm or refute a causal link between glucocorticoid injection and bacterial endocarditis, but clinicians should specifically exert caution and carefully counsel patients with risk factors for endocarditis, such as those with a prosthetic heart valve.

### New developments in osteoarthritis pharmacological therapies [^116s7y4b]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Novel use of existing therapies

Oral prednisolone was trialled in the Hand Osteoarthritis Prednisolone Efficacy study. The 92 nodular hand OA participants with finger pain and clinical and US-detected inflammation in ≥ 1 IP joint were randomized to receive prednisolone 10 mg or placebo daily for 6 weeks, followed by a 2-week tapering. Visual analogue scale (VAS) finger pain improvement at week 6 was significantly greater in the prednisolone group. However, after tapering, mean group differences became non-significant.

US-guided IA CS was also trialled for hip OA. In that study, the 199 participants were randomized to receive US-guided IA hip injection (USGI) of 40 mg triamcinolone acetonide and 4 mL 1% lidocaine hydrochloride combined with best current treatment (BCT) vs BCT alone and USGI of 5 mL 1% lidocaine only combined with BCT. There was greater mean numeric rating scale (NRS) improvement in hip pain intensity over 6 months with BCT plus triamcinolone/lidocaine compared with BCT alone. There was no significant difference over 6 months between BCT plus triamcinolone/lidocaine and BCT plus lidocaine only for hip pain intensity improvement, and the true effect of IA CSs for hip OA remains uncertain.

Injection guidance methods — landmark, fluoroscopy, and ultrasound: Our literature search did not show a study that compared fluoroscopy with landmark-based injection. Overall, studies showed improved accuracy of US-guided (USG) over landmark-based injections. One review showed the US to have improved accuracy over fluoroscopy in glenohumeral joint injections, but did not reach statistical significance. Two other studies showed comparable results in accuracy, pain relief, and functional outcomes between US-guided and fluoroscopy-guided glenohumeral joint injections. A study showed significantly better accuracy with US compared with fluoroscopy in injections around the long head of the biceps, but there were no differences in pain relief or complications.

### 2019 American College of Rheumatology / arthritis foundation guideline for the management of osteoarthritis of the hand, hip, and knee [^115XUinh]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Intraarticular glucocorticoid injections for osteoarthritis (OA) are strongly recommended for patients with knee and/or hip OA and conditionally recommended for patients with hand OA. Trials of intraarticular glucocorticoid injections have demonstrated short-term efficacy in knee OA, and intraarticular glucocorticoid injection is conditionally, rather than strongly, recommended for hand OA given the lack of evidence specific to this anatomic location. There are insufficient data to judge the choice of short-acting over long-acting preparations or the use of low rather than high doses.

Osteoarthritis of the hip — intraarticular corticosteroid injections of the hip are feasible for most, however they are often performed with image-guidance, such as fluoroscopy or ultrasound, and patients who do not have access to clinicians with those imaging technologies may not have access to intraarticular corticosteroid injections in the hip; future research is warranted to better understand the adverse events with intraarticular corticosteroid use, particularly infection and rapidly progressive osteoarthritis of the hip, and further studies are also needed with consistent dosing of corticosteroids as well as delivery methods.

### Efficacy and safety of non-pharmacological, pharmacological and surgical treatment for hand osteoarthritis: a systematic literature review informing the 2018 update of the EULAR recommendations for the management of hand osteoarthritis [^11496s96]. RMD Open (2018). Low credibility.

To update the evidence on efficacy and safety of non-pharmacological, pharmacological and surgical interventions for hand osteoarthritis (OA), a systematic literature review was performed up to June 2017, including (randomised) controlled trials or Cochrane systematic reviews. Main efficacy outcomes were pain, function and hand strength. Risk of bias was assessed. Meta-analysis was performed when advisable. Of 7036 records, 127 references were included, of which 50 studies concerned non-pharmacological, 64 pharmacological and 12 surgical interventions. Many studies had high risk of bias, mainly due to inadequate randomisation or blinding. Beneficial non-pharmacological treatments included hand exercise and prolonged thumb base splinting, while single trials showed positive results for joint protection and using assistive devices. Topical and oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) proved equally effective, while topical NSAIDs led to less adverse events. Single trials demonstrated positive results for chondroitin sulfate and intra-articular glucocorticoid injections in interphalangeal joints. Pharmacological treatments for which no clear beneficial effect was shown include paracetamol, intra-articular thumb base injections of glucocorticoids or hyaluronic acid, low-dose oral glucocorticoids, hydroxychloroquine and anti-tumour necrosis factor. No trials compared surgery to sham or non-operative treatment. No surgical intervention for thumb base OA appeared more effective than another, although in general more complex procedures led to more complications. No interventions slowed radiographic progression. In conclusion, an overview of the evidence on efficacy and safety of treatment options for hand OA was presented and informed the task force for the updated European League Against Rheumatism management recommendations for hand OA.

Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) dosing, imaging selection, injection intervals, efficacy duration, and adverse effects are summarized for musculoskeletal injections. US requires expertise; hence the physician should employ the imaging modality with which they are most experienced and comfortable. There is little evidence to guide the selection of one corticosteroid over another. For dosing, a dose of 20 mg triamcinolone is as effective as 40 mg TA for shoulder IACS, the most commonly used dose for hip IACS was 40 mg TA or MPA, and triamcinolone 40 mg is as effective as 80 mg for knee IACS. For frequency, we suggest a minimum interval of 2–3 weeks between injections, up to 3 months, and overall, IACS results in short-term (4 weeks to 3 months) pain relief. Adverse effects from IACS are related to the procedure and corticosteroid exposure and include an increase in blood glucose, adrenal suppression, detrimental effect on cartilage, reduction of BMD, and PJI.

### A randomized controlled trial of the cost-effectiveness of ultrasound-guided intraarticular injection of inflammatory arthritis [^113ivXyi]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

We studied whether sonographic needle guidance affected the outcomes of intraarticular (IA) injection for inflammatory arthritis.

Methods

Joints with inflammatory arthritis (n = 244; 76% rheumatoid arthritis, 3% small joints, 51% intermediate, and 46% large) were randomized to injection by conventional palpation-guided anatomic injection (120 joints) or sonographic image-guided injection enhanced with a 1-handed reciprocating procedure device mechanical syringe (124 joints). A 1-needle, 2-syringe technique was used. After IA placement and synovial space dilation were confirmed by sonography, a syringe exchange was performed, and triamcinolone acetonide was injected with the second syringe through the indwelling IA needle. Baseline pain, procedural pain, pain at outcome (2 weeks and 6 months), responders, therapeutic duration, reinjection rates, total cost, and cost per responder were determined.

Results

Relative to conventional palpation-guided methods, sonographic guidance for injection of inflammatory arthritis resulted in an 81% reduction in injection pain (p < 0.001), 35% reduction in pain scores at outcome (p < 0.02), 38% increase in the responder rate (p < 0.003), 34% reduction in the non-responder rate (p < 0.003), 32% increase in therapeutic duration (p = 0.01), 8% reduction ($7) in cost/patient/year, and a 33% ($64) reduction in cost/responder/year for a hospital outpatient (p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Sonographic needle guidance improves the performance, clinical outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of IA injections for inflammatory arthritis. (Clinical Trial Identifier NCT00651625).

Targeted injection therapy

20. Local corticosteroid injections are safe and effective, and can be offered as an adjunct for the relief of inflammation and pain in the foot in IA. Image guidance using radiology or ultrasound should be considered and available if needed. SOR: 1; LOE: C; SOA: 98.
21. Children and young people undergoing local corticosteroid injection should be offered access to general anaesthesia or conscious sedation in a suitable paediatric environment. SOR: 1; LOE: C; SOA: 99.

Rationale

Weak evidence for the effectiveness of US-guided injections on foot pain reduction in adults with IA has been demonstrated in a systematic review of four uncontrolled trials and one comparative trial. The GWG accepted the effectiveness of palpation-guided and US-guided injections to reduce pain and inflammation. Whilst evidence of the effectiveness of US-guided over palpation-guided injections in the foot is lacking, US-guided injections theoretically allow more accurate needle placement, injection of structures that are difficult to access and avoidance of other structures. However, RCTs at other joint sites do not show convincingly that US-guided injections are more effective than systemic or palpation-guided corticosteroid injections or sham lavage plus corticosteroid.

There is weak evidence from observational studies of improved outcomes following local intra-articular corticosteroid ankle and subtalar joint injections in children and young people with JIA. Conscious sedation provides safe and effective short-term relief of pain and anxiety during intra-articular injections and can be considered in children and young people with IA. General anaesthesia may be more suitable in certain cases (e.g. younger children or for multiple injections).

Local corticosteroid injections are well-tolerated. Serious side-effects are rare Administration is standard practice in other joints in IA (e.g. knees, shoulders), with evidence from RCTs for improved outcomes.

Acromioclavicular and glenohumeral intra-articular corticosteroid injections (IACS) — image-guided versus landmark guidance: Ultrasound-guided (USG) IACS for painful acromioclavicular joint due to OA produced better pain and functional outcomes than landmark-guided IACS at 6 months, and a 2012 Cochrane review reported better pain outcomes at 6 weeks with image-guided injections in three out of five trials; however, a recent double-blind RCT between USG and landmark-guided injections for adhesive capsulitis did not show a difference in pain or functional outcomes. For glenohumeral joint injections, landmark accuracy issues are noted and IACS injection into the glenohumeral joint through landmark is not recommended.

Corticosteroid injections for adult chronic joint pain are described with use, techniques, and safety considerations. Pain in the shoulder, hip, knees, or fingers is common in patients over 40 years of age, and peripheral joint injections are used after failure of conservative management with the objective of reducing pain and improving function. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections (IACS) and other musculoskeletal injections alleviate inflammation and reduce pain, improve function, facilitate rehabilitation, or give some temporary relief until definitive treatment, for example, surgery, can be undertaken, and injections include local anesthetic, hyaluronic acid, platelet-rich plasma (PRP), mesenchymal stromal cells, and corticosteroid. For patients with joint pain, such injections are performed using landmark techniques or guided by ultrasound (US) or fluoroscopy. Clinical studies revealed corticosteroid-related adverse events; these include decrease in bone mineral density (BMD), inhibition of the hypothalamic pituitary axis, increase in blood sugar, and postoperative joint infection, and these events are compounded by clinicians injecting amounts higher than minimally effective doses; moreover, there has been no publication that compared the safety of the different procedures with landmark, US, or fluoroscopy across the joints' spectrum.

### Effectiveness of ultrasound guidance on intraarticular and periarticular joint injections: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^111X1dLk]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of ultrasound-guided intraarticular and periarticular joint injections as compared with landmark-guided injections technique.

Methods

A systematic literature search was performed in Medline, Web of Science, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, reference lists of articles, and other sources. Only randomized controlled trials were included. Two reviewers independently selected and assessed each study for quality and extracted data.

Results

Twelve randomized controlled trials were included in the meta-analysis. The results indicated that ultrasound-guided intraarticular and periarticular joint injections were more accurate than the landmark-guided injections (odds ratio, 0.36; 95% confidence interval, 0.22–0.60). Ultrasound-guided joint injections significantly decreased the visual analog scale scores at both 2 wks (mean difference, -9.57; 95% confidence interval, -13.14 to -5.99) (P < 0.00001) and 6 wks (mean difference, -14.21; 95% confidence interval, -18.20 to -10.21) (P < 0.00001) after injection. There was no statistically significant difference in visual analog scale score at 12 wks between ultrasound-guided and landmark-guided intraarticular and periarticular joint injections (mean difference, -4.42; 95% confidence interval, -11.71 to 2.87) (P = 0.23).

Conclusions

Intraarticular and periarticular injections using ultrasound guidance significantly improves the accuracy of joint injections, and there is a significant decrease in visual analog scale scores for up to 6 wks after injection. The effect of ultrasound guidance on the long-term outcome of joint injections is inconclusive. The improved accuracy of injections was associated with pain relief. The authors recommend routine ultrasound guidance for intraarticular and periarticular injections.

Small joint injections — clinical recommendations state that clinicians should preferably offer US guidance when performing injections into the small joints of the wrists, hands, feet, and ankles, as it may provide benefit (eg, reduced procedural pain) over landmark-based guidance (Grade C). In patients with active rheumatoid arthritis in the small joints of the wrists and hands, IACSSI may be used as an adjunct therapy to decrease pain, improve function, and reduce signs and symptoms of inflammation (Grade C). For trigger finger, clinicians should perform CSI with 20 mg triamcinolone/methylprednisolone corticosteroid equivalent rather than 5 or 10 mg (Grade C), and clinicians should offer thumb splints in conjunction with CSI for De Quervain's tenosynovitis (Grade C). For plantar fascia, clinicians can perform corticosteroid injections for rheumatic inflammatory heel pain not responsive to conservative measures (Grade C) and should avoid plantar fascia injections with corticosteroids for noninflammatory plantar heel pain.

### The effect of image-guided corticosteroid injections on thumb carpometacarpal arthritis [^112TNPXs]. Hand (2021). Medium credibility.

Background: Arthritis involving the thumb carpometacarpal (CMC) joint is common in the adult population. Initial treatment includes corticosteroid injections. Injections can be performed with image guidance to assist with placement; however, the clinical benefits are unclear. Methods: This retrospective study used Truven Health Marketscan Research Databases to identify patients from 2003 to 2014 with common International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes for osteoarthritis of the CMC joint, Common Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes for image and non-image-guided injections, and codes for surgical interventions. Length of time from injection until subsequent injection(s) and/or surgery was extrapolated for identified patients. Analysis of variance and binomial logistic regression were used to compare continuous variables and calculate odds ratios, respectively. Results: We identified 62 333 patients (68% women, 32% men), average age 59.7, with common ICD-9 diagnostic codes for CMC arthritis with respective injection CPT codes. The average number of days between the first and second injection for patients treated with non-guided injection was 237.3 versus 266.7 for image-guided injections. Of the 62333 patients, 8107 went on to operative treatment. Among operative patients, the average number of days to surgery following non-guided injection was 317.7 versus 333.7 days in the image-guided group. The average cost of performing non-image-guided injections was $203 less than using ultrasound. Conclusions: Image-guided thumb CMC injections do not result in significant increases in time between injections and do not lead to a meaningful delay to surgery. Future research needs to clarify the value of image-guided CMC injections in an increasingly economically conscientious health care environment.

Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) injection and peri-articular corticosteroid injection are commonly used to treat musculoskeletal conditions. Results vary by musculoskeletal region, but most studies report short-term benefit with mixed results on long-term relief. Publications showed adverse events from single corticosteroid injections. Recommended effective doses were lower than those currently used by clinicians.

Methods

Development of the practice guideline for joint injections was approved by the Board of Directors of the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine and the participating societies. A Corticosteroid Safety Work Group coordinated the development of three guidelines: peripheral nerve blocks and trigger points; joints; and neuraxial, facet, and sacroiliac joint injections. The topics included safety of the technique in relation to landmark-guided, ultrasound-guided, or radiology-aided injections; effect of the addition of the corticosteroid on the efficacy of the injectate; and adverse events related to the injection. Experts on the topics were assigned to extensively review the literature and initially develop consensus statements and recommendations. A modified version of the US Preventive Services Task Force grading of evidence and strength of recommendation was followed. A modified Delphi process was adhered to in arriving at a consensus.

Results

This guideline focuses on the safety and efficacy of corticosteroid joint injections for managing joint chronic pain in adults. The joints that were addressed included the shoulder, elbow, hand, wrist, hip, knee, and small joints of the hands and feet. All the statements and recommendations were approved by all participants and the Board of Directors of the participating societies after four rounds of discussion. There is little evidence to guide the selection of one corticosteroid over another. Ultrasound guidance increases the accuracy of injections and reduces procedural pain. A dose of 20 mg triamcinolone is as effective as 40 mg for both shoulder IACS and subacromial subdeltoid bursa corticosteroid injections. The commonly used dose for hip IACS is 40 mg triamcinolone or methylprednisolone. Triamcinolone 40 mg is as effective as 80 mg for knee IACS. Overall, IACS injections result in short-term pain relief from a few weeks to a few months. The adverse events include an increase in blood glucose, adrenal suppression, detrimental effect on cartilage lining the joint, reduction of bone mineral density, and postoperative joint infection.

Conclusions

In this practice guideline, we provided specific recommendations on the role of corticosteroids in joint, bursa, and peritendon injections for musculoskeletal pain.

### Clinical effectiveness of one ultrasound guided intra-articular corticosteroid and local anaesthetic injection in addition to advice and education for hip osteoarthritis (HIT trial): single blind, parallel group, three arm, randomised controlled trial [^111ELAeG]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations of this study

The strengths of our trial include the large sample size, the inclusion of two comparison arms, the length of follow-up, and the high response rates. To optimise generalisability, we recruited from both primary care and community based musculoskeletal services and had pragmatic inclusion and exclusion criteria. Most participants (94%) preferred to receive an injection, meaning that individuals in the BCT group, which did not receive an injection, might have experienced resentful demoralisation that might have accentuated differences between arms. However, our subgroup analysis did not support an interaction between treatment preference and outcome. Self-reported outcomes are a limitation because the primary comparison of BCT versus BCT plus ultrasound-triamcinolone-lidocaine was unblinded. Participants and clinicians were blinded to injection type; nine (14%) participants in the BCT plus ultrasound-triamcinolone-lidocaine group identified their injection correctly (table 3), although most people (> 80%) in both groups were unsure. Recruitment was challenging and necessitated amendments to the inclusion criteria and target sample size. Recruitment did not reach the revised target of 204 participants by five participants; however, the follow-up exceeded the required number of participants at the primary endpoint. The trial was powered for the primary comparison of BCT plus ultrasound-triamcinolone-lidocaine versus BCT, and the study was probably underpowered to assess differences between the two injection groups, and also to detect significant interactions between baseline moderators of treatment and outcomes. However, our primary interest in this pragmatic trial was effectiveness of BCT plus ultrasound-triamcinolone-lidocaine versus BCT, and including a BCT group enabled a cost effectiveness analysis (reported separately). We did not include a placebo comparison, such as saline; in our locality, corticosteroid hip injections are available within the National Health Service (despite the limited evidence base) and we felt that a placebo controlled trial evaluating a therapy that is available would not be ethically appropriate and might adversely affect patients' willingness to participate. Loss to follow-up was higher in the BCT group; however, results from our sensitivity analysis accounting for missing data showed similar findings to the main analysis. Finally, we did not include radiographical outcomes. Participants were mostly of white ethnicity possibly limiting the generalisability of the findings to other ethnic groups.

### US-guided injection of the upper and lower extremity joints [^114k1U2z]. European Journal of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

There is a growing interest in the application of ultrasound (US) guidance for diagnostic and therapeutic joint injections. US provides direct visualization of soft tissues and the outer borders of bony structures. With real-time needle guidance the success rate of intra-articular injections improves and iatrogenic damage to anatomic structures can be avoided. An US machine is more readily available, transferrable and more affordable than a fluoroscopy machine or CT scanner and lacks the risk of radiation. These factors make US a valuable alternative to procedures performed either blind or under fluoroscopic or CT guidance. This article focuses on the rationale for injections in the upper and lower extremity joints and describes and illustrates the different US-guided injection techniques.

### Open surgery versus ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection for trigger finger: a randomized controlled trial with 1-year follow-up [^111HRvkQ]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

Trigger finger is a common condition with a lifetime prevalence of 2%. Corticosteroid injection is a treatment often considered as a first-line intervention with reported cure rates between 60% and 90% in observational cohorts. Nevertheless, open surgery remains the most effective treatment with reported cure rates near 100%. Head-to-head trials on these treatments are limited. We investigated the efficacy of open surgery compared with ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injections.

Methods

The study was performed as a single-center, randomized, controlled trial with a 1-year follow-up. A total of 165 patients received either open surgery (n = 81) or ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection (n = 84). Follow-up was conducted at 3 and 12 months. If the finger had normal movement or normal movement with discomfort at latest follow-up, the outcome was considered a success. Secondary outcomes were postprocedural pain and complications.

Results

The groups were similar at baseline except for lower alcohol consumption in the open surgery group. At 3 months, 86% and 99% were successfully treated after corticosteroid injection and open surgery, respectively. At 12 months, 49% and 99% were considered successfully treated after corticosteroid injection and open surgery, respectively. The pain score at latest follow-up was significantly higher in the corticosteroid injection group. Complications after open surgery were more severe and included 3 superficial infections and 1 iatrogenic nerve lesion. After corticosteroid injection 11 patients experienced a steroid flare and 2 had fat necrosis at the site of injection.

Conclusions

Open surgery is superior to ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injections. Complications after open surgery are more severe; this must be taken into account when advising patients with regard to treatment.

BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

We summarise the number and percentage of participants affected by protocol deviations. A per protocol subanalysis of the primary outcome was used, excluding trial treatment related deviators. Several prespecified exploratory subgroup analyses for the primary outcome were performed using linear mixed modelling, including an interaction term for treatment multiplied by baseline subgroup variable: participants receiving their preferred treatment (Yes/No), illness perceptions (split around baseline overall median value), body mass index (< 25, ≥ 25), symptom duration (< six, ≥ six months), pain severity (< 5, ≥ 5), and, in the injection groups only, presence of synovitis or effusion (Yes/No). We report the numbers and percentages of adverse events, stratified by severity and by treatment group, including the number needed to harm for treatment comparisons.

All statistical tests were tests of superiority with 5% two tailed significance levels and adjusted for the following baseline covariates: eligibility current pain Numerical Rating Scale score, age, sex, and corresponding baseline value for secondary outcomes. The corresponding 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 15 and R version 3.4.2. An external trial steering and data monitoring committee were appointed.

Patient and public involvement

A study patient advisory group advised on study design before funding, in study set-up, and during recruitment. They chose the term best current treatment and informed the design of clinic procedures (including how best to reduce the burden of intervention), questionnaire design, and participant information. This group informed protocol modifications in response to low recruitment, and guided interpretation of the findings. Two public contributors were members of the independent trial steering committee.

### Ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection in carpal tunnel syndrome: comparison between radial and ulnar approaches [^116dBSw4]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To compare two common approaches for ultrasonography (US)-guided injection.

Patients and Methods

Sixty patients with mild-to-moderate CTS were included in this double-blind randomized controlled trial (RCT). They received a single shot of corticosteroid injection through either the US-guided in-plane approach: radial or ulnar side. Participants were evaluated using Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) and visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain, as well as electrodiagnosis (EDX) and US parameters before the intervention, and within 12 weeks of follow-up.

Results

In both groups, all outcomes, except for the electrodiagnostic measures, significantly improved within the follow-up. Pain-VAS and both subscales of BCTQ questionnaire, as our main subjective outcomes, revealed dramatic improvement, with the largest amount of changes in VAS (70%; comparing to baseline value), and about 37% for both of BQSS and BQFS scales, all indicating superiority of radial to ulnar in-plane approach. During the first follow-up, we did not detect any remarkable preference between the groups in either subjective or electrodiagnostic variables. However, there was a significant difference at next follow-up time-points in terms of VAS for pain and BQFS favoring radial approach (Table 3). Furthermore, US-measured parameters including nerve-circumference and CSA improved only in the radial in-plane group.

Conclusion

The current data proved that radial in-plane approach for CTS injection could be at least as effective as the more common ulnar in-plane method. Even the pain-relief effect was longer for the radial in-plane approach. Also, patients' functional status and objective variables all revealed better outcomes via the new approach.

### Clinical effectiveness of one ultrasound guided intra-articular corticosteroid and local anaesthetic injection in addition to advice and education for hip osteoarthritis (HIT trial): single blind, parallel group, three arm, randomised controlled trial [^111LZmSL]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Two blinded statisticians independently conducted analysis by intention to treat, following a pre-agreed statistical analysis plan. The main comparison was between BCT plus ultrasound-triamcinolone-lidocaine and BCT, with BCT plus ultrasound-triamcinolone-lidocaine versus BCT plus ultrasound-lidocaine a secondary comparison; all paired comparisons were undertaken before unblinding.

A linear mixed model for repeated measures was used to derive estimates of average (equally weighted overall follow-up) between group difference in pain Numerical Rating Scale scores across the four follow-up time points. The same model estimated differences in pain Numerical Rating Scale scores between groups at the two week, two month, four month, and six month time points through modelling the interaction of treatment group and (dummy) time. We used longitudinal mixed models to evaluate between group comparisons for the secondary outcome measures: using linear regression for numerical outcomes and log binomial regression (or Poisson regression with robust standard errors in the event of non-convergence) for categorical outcomes, with random effects at the patient level to take into account clustering through repeated measures.

Standardised mean differences were calculated as the ratio of the estimated mean difference to the standard deviation of pain scores (derived as the mean of standard deviations across follow-up times). We present absolute mean difference for numerical outcomes and relative risk, absolute risk difference, and number needed to treat (NNT) for binary outcomes. The pain Numerical Rating Scale was dichotomised around a cut-off of < 5 (low pain) versus ≥ 5 (moderate to severe pain).

A sensitivity analysis of the primary outcome measure was performed through multiple imputation using chain equations with 20 imputations, inclusive of complete baseline variables and the baseline current pain Numerical Rating Scale score as predictors. We did multiple imputation analyses, incorporating plausible best-case and worst-case deviations from ignorable missingness, setting imputations as 1 point higher and lower than the imputed values (corresponding to the minimal clinically important difference of 1 point), and 2.5 points higher and lower (corresponding to the anticipated standard deviations for pain scores). We explored missing data patterns to examine association of missingness with baseline and follow-up measures; all variables were correlated using point-biserial correlation versus a created variable for full or incomplete follow-up data, and prognostic baseline characteristics were compared for those with full follow-up data between treatment groups to explore the effect of differential attrition.

### Image-guided glucocorticoid injection versus injection without image guidance for shoulder pain [^116Grb9k]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite widespread use, our 2012 Cochrane review did not confirm that use of imaging to guide glucocorticoid injection for people with shoulder pain improves its efficacy.

Objectives

To update our review and assess the benefits and harms of image-guided glucocorticoid injection compared to non-image-guided injection for patients with shoulder pain.

Search Methods

We updated the search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, via Ovid), MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid) and clinicaltrials.gov to 15 Feb 2021, and the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (http://www.who.int/trialsearch/Default.aspx) to 06 July 2020. We also screened reference lists of retrieved review articles and trials to identify potentially relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials that compared image-guided glucocorticoid injection to injection without image guidance (either landmark-guided or intramuscular) injection in patients with shoulder pain (rotator cuff disease, adhesive capsulitis or mixed or undefined shoulder pain). Major outcomes were pain, function, proportion of participants with treatment success, quality of life, adverse events, serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events. Minor outcomes were shoulder range of motion and proportion of participants requiring surgery or additional injections. There were no restrictions on language or date of publication.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodologic procedures expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

Nineteen trials were included (1035 participants). Fourteen trials included participants with rotator cuff disease, four with adhesive capsulitis, and one with mixed or undefined shoulder pain. Trial size varied from 28 to 256 participants, most participants were female, mean age ranged between 31 and 60 years, and mean symptom duration varied from 2 to 23 months. Two trials were at low risk of bias for all criteria. The most notable sources of bias in the remaining trials included performance bias and detection bias. Moderate-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias) indicates that ultrasound-guided injection probably provides little or no clinically important benefits compared with injection without guidance with respect to pain (15 trials) or function (14 trials) at three to six weeks follow-up. It may not improve quality of life (2 trials, low-certainty evidence, downgraded due to potential for bias and imprecision) and we are uncertain about the effect of ultrasound-guided injection on participant-rated treatment success due to very low-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias, inconsistency and imprecision). Mean pain (scale range 0 to 10, higher scores indicate more pain) was 3.1 points with injection without image guidance and 0.5 points better (0.2 points better to 0.8 points better; 1003 participants, 15 trials) with an ultrasound-guided injection. This represents a slight difference for pain (0.5 to 1.0 points on a 0 to 10 scale). Mean function (scale range 0 to 100, higher scores indicate better function) was 68 points with injection without image guidance and 2.4 points better (0.2 points worse to 5.1 points better; 895 participants, 14 trials) with an ultrasound-guided injection. Mean quality of life (scale range 0 to 100, higher scores indicate better quality of life) was 65 with injection without image guidance and 2.8 points better (0.7 worse to 6.4 better; 220 participants, 2 trials) with an ultrasound-guided injection. In five trials (350 participants), 101/175 (or 606 per 1000) people in the ultrasound-guided group reported treatment success compared with 68/175 (or 389 per 1000) people in the group injected without image guidance (RR 1.56 (95% CI 0.89 to 2.75)), an absolute difference of 22% more reported success (4% fewer to 62% more). Low-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision) indicates that ultrasound-guided injections may not reduce the risk of adverse events compared to injections without image guidance. In five trials (402 participants), 38/200 (or 181 per 1000) people in the ultrasound-guided group reported adverse events compared with 51/202 (or 252 per 1000) in the non-image-guided injection group (RR 0.72 (95% CI 0.4 to 1.28)), an absolute difference of 7% fewer adverse events (15% fewer to 7% more). Five trials reported that there were no serious adverse events. The remaining trials did not report serious adverse events. One trial reported that 1/53 (or 19 per 1000) in the injection without image guidance group and 0/53 in the ultrasound-guided group withdrew due to adverse events. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the effects for pain and function may have been influenced by selection bias, and the effects for function may have been influenced by detection bias. The test for subgroup differences indicated there were unlikely to be differences in pain and function across different shoulder conditions.

Authors' Conclusions

Our updated review does not support use of image guidance for injections in the shoulder. Moderate-certainty evidence indicates that ultrasound-guided injection in the treatment of shoulder pain probably provides little or no benefit over injection without imaging in terms of pain or function and low-certainty evidence indicates there may be no difference in quality of life. We are uncertain if ultrasound-guided injection improves participant-rated treatment success, due to very low-certainty evidence. Low-certainty evidence also suggests ultrasound-guided injection may not reduce the risk of adverse events compared with non-image-guided injection. No serious adverse events were reported in any trial. The lack of significant benefit of image guidance over injection without image guidance to improve patient-relevant outcomes or reduce harms, suggests that any added cost of image guidance appears unjustified.

Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Biceps tendon sheath injection — guidance accuracy, outcomes, dosing, and safety: Among patients with anterior shoulder pain attributed to the biceps, 43% had a normally appearing biceps tendon. Ultrasound-guided (USG) injection accuracy was 87% compared with 27% for landmark technique, and US was more accurate than palpation-guided injection (100% vs 86%) with less discomfort. US also produced significantly better pain relief and QuickDASH improvement at 4 weeks and 6 months compared with comparators. A 10-year retrospective review showed higher first-pass (91% vs 74%) and final-pass (98% vs 90%) rates for US than fluoroscopy, while a separate retrospective fluoroscopy-guided series included only six patients. Commonly used doses are triamcinolone acetonide 40 mg in 1 mL and methylprednisolone acetate 40 mg in 1 mL. Tendon rupture can be a consequence of corticosteroid injection into the tendon.

### Clinical effectiveness of one ultrasound guided intra-articular corticosteroid and local anaesthetic injection in addition to advice and education for hip osteoarthritis (HIT trial): single blind, parallel group, three arm, randomised controlled trial [^11313Zp6]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Hip osteoarthritis affects a substantial and growing number of people worldwide and is a leading cause of global disability, with a large proportion of those affected experiencing persistent pain, functional loss, and impaired quality of life. In 2019, more than 100 000 primary total hip replacements were undertaken in the UK, at a cost exceeding £500m (€596m; $659m). Ninety per cent of these surgeries were for osteoarthritis. Although not all patients with hip osteoarthritis require surgery, the numbers of hip replacements continue to increase. Patients with hip osteoarthritis are typically treated in primary care for several years before surgical referral, with evidence suggesting that primary care management is suboptimal.

Guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence advises combining non-drug and drug approaches, with education, exercise, and weight reduction as core treatments. Analgesic options include paracetamol (acetaminophen), with intra-articular corticosteroid injection recommended as an adjunct if pain is moderate to severe. However, guidelines highlight that the clinical and economic evidence supporting the use of intra-articular hip corticosteroid injection is limited and conflicting, and recommend intra-articular corticosteroid for knee osteoarthritis but not for hip osteoarthritis. A systematic review identified only five trials of corticosteroid injection in people with hip osteoarthritis, which were limited by recruitment from secondary care (eg, surgical waiting lists), and small sample sizes (n = 36–101). Two randomised controlled trials showed clinical benefits of corticosteroid and local anaesthetic injection, compared with control injection, at eight weeks after injection, with only one trial reporting outcomes beyond 8 weeks (non-significant reduction in pain between intervention and control). These previous randomised controlled trials compared corticosteroid injection with either local anaesthetic or saline but only one used the comparison of standard care. In addition to uncertainties about patient selection and effectiveness, use of intra-articular corticosteroid injection can also be limited by availability. Hip injections require imaging guidance, either using fluoroscopy or ultrasound, to improve the accuracy of placement. Ultrasonography avoids ionising radiation or a contrast agent and is more widely available than fluoroscopy because ultrasound guided injections at other sites are commonly performed in outpatient settings. However, only two randomised controlled trials of corticosteroid injections in hip osteoarthritis used ultrasound guidance.

In this study the clinical effectiveness of best current treatment (BCT) plus an ultrasound guided intra-articular hip injection of triamcinolone and lidocaine or of lidocaine alone was compared with BCT.

### Ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection therapy for juvenile idiopathic arthritis: 12-year care experience [^111cDH5d]. Pediatric Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Intra-articular corticosteroid injections are a safe and effective treatment for patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. The potential scope of care in ultrasound-guided corticosteroid therapy in children and a joint-based corticosteroid dose protocol designed to optimize interdisciplinary care are not found in the current literature.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to report the spectrum of care, technique and safety of ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injection therapy in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and to propose an age-weight-joint-based corticosteroid dose protocol.

Materials and Methods

A retrospective analysis was performed of 198 patients (ages 21 months to 28 years) referred for treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis with corticosteroid therapy. Symptomatic joints and tendon sheaths were treated as prescribed by the referring rheumatologist. An age-weight-joint-based dose protocol was developed and utilized for corticosteroid dose prescription.

Results

A total of 1,444 corticosteroid injections (1,340 joints, 104 tendon sheaths) were performed under US guidance. Injection sites included small, medium and large appendicular skeletal joints (upper extremity 497, lower extremity 837) and six temporomandibular joints. For patients with recurrent symptoms, 414 repeat injections were performed, with an average time interval of 17.7 months (range, 0.5–101.5 months) between injections. Complications occurred in 2.6% of injections and included subcutaneous tissue atrophy, skin hypopigmentation, erythema and pruritis.

Conclusion

US-guided corticosteroid injection therapy provides dynamic, precise and safe treatment of a broad spectrum of joints and tendon sheaths throughout the entire pediatric musculoskeletal system. An age-weight-joint-based corticosteroid dose protocol is effective and integral to interdisciplinary care of patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

### Ultrasonography and color Doppler in juvenile idiopathic arthritis: diagnosis and follow-up of ultrasound-guided steroid injection in the wrist region. A descriptive interventional study [^115XNnom]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Steroid injections constitute a major form of treatment in JIA, at disease onset or during the course of the disease. The clinical effect of such an injection depends on accurate placement of the steroid in the diseased compartment. Imaging-guidance can significantly improve the accuracy, and US is the best available technique for guided injections. Indeed, in a number of studies significantly better results were obtained using imaging-guided injections, compared to palpation-guided injections, in treatment of adults with arthritis/osteoarthritis in large and small joints and of children with arthritis in the ankle region. Common clinical practice in JIA with wrist swelling has been to perform a palpation-guided injection in the radio-carpal joint, whereas injection of the midcarpal joints or tendon sheaths is done less frequently.

To our knowledge, our study is the first to describe US-guided steroid injections in the wrist region in JIA. Inasmuch as US-guidance of injections in this region is an established practice at the Pediatric Rheumatology Outpatient Clinic, Rigshospitalet, we considered it unethical to randomize patients to either palpation-guided or US-guided injections.

Small joint injections — interphalangeal (IP), metacarpophalangeal (MCP)/proximal interphalangeal (PIP), tarsometatarsal (TMT), and metatarsophalangeal (MTP) — show higher accuracy with ultrasound-guided injection (USGI) than landmark-guided injection (LMGI): for IP joints, the mean accuracy of USGI was 100% whereas LMGI was 0%; for MCP and PIP joints, USGI was 96% and LMGI 59%; for TMT joints, USGIs were more accurate (64% accurate) than LMGIs (25% accurate); and for MTP joints, studies found 100% accuracy for USGI with one noting poor accuracy (0% accuracy) with LMGI. Only a single level 4 study addressed efficacy, reporting USGI of the MCP and MTP joints were efficacious, but with study-design limitations; authors note that current research suggests USGIs in small joints are more accurate than LMGIs, yet further research is required and there is insufficient evidence to determine whether USGI small joint injections are more efficacious or cost-effective than LMGI.

### Ultrasound-guided triamcinolone injections for hidradenitis suppurativa lesions: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114zrn8t]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and Future Directions

This systematic review found early data suggesting there may be benefits to incorporating US into TAC injections for HS lesions in terms of response rates, healing rates, pain improvement, and enhancing provider understanding of effective injection techniques. However, the amount of high‐quality data in this area is limited. The ideal location of injection relative to the lesion should be determined for each lesion type, and for the first time, US incorporation opens opportunities to study this aspect of dermatological care. Once this has been evaluated, a direct comparison of outcomes between US‐guided and non‐US‐guided injections should be performed. Other studies that may be completed include evaluating changes in lesional characteristics over time, such as changes in size, vascularity, and inflammation in surrounding tissue.

Hip intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) injections — statements and recommendations: IACS hip injections are commonly performed for diagnosis in hip osteoarthritis and for short-term (4–12 weeks) pain relief (Level of certainty: high). Potential adverse effects may include accelerated cartilage loss, subchondral insufficiency fractures, osteonecrosis, and rarely rapid joint destruction (Level of certainty: moderate). Pre-injection/screening X-ray of the hip joint may help to verify baseline pathology that would preclude corticosteroid injection (Level of certainty: moderate). Education and exercise used with IACS result in better global improvement than IACS alone at 1 year, with similar pain relief (Level of certainty: low). Safety and accuracy of greater trochanteric bursa corticosteroid injections are similar across landmarks, fluoroscopy, or ultrasound (Grade B). Caution should be taken with high-dose and multiple injections; consider using the lowest effective corticosteroid dose for hip IACS while extending the interval between repeat CSI (Grade B). Consider using a 40 mg dose of triamcinolone or a comparable corticosteroid dose for IACS hip injection (Grade B). Pre-injection/screening X-ray should be performed prior to IACS hip injection to verify baseline pathology including osteonecrosis (Grade B). Patient education and physiotherapy exercises should be offered in conjunction with or prior to CSI for greater trochanteric pain syndrome (Grade B). Hip trochanteric bursa injections can be performed using landmark guidance (Grade B).

### Ultrasound-guided methotrexate injection for De quervain disease of the wrist: what lies beyond the horizon? [^1172ZcCo]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Musculoskeletal ultrasound plays an important role in the detection of the anatomic variations of the first extensor compartment, including septa, tendon slips, and osseous ridges. It can reveal many pathological findings such as synovial hypertrophy, peritendinous hypervascularity, thickening of the retinaculum and tendon, and intratendinous microtears. Additionally, ultrasound-guided injection prevents intratendinous injection and reduces the risk of subsequent tear, precisely introduces the injectate to the affected region in case of an intracompartmental septum, and prevents the superficial radial nerve from the injury. In this case, ultrasound imaging clearly demonstrated thickening of the retinaculum, which might be the main factor leading to recurrence after overuse of the wrist.

Methotrexate, a disease modifying antirheumatic drug, is widely used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. A key feature of intra-articular pathology of rheumatoid arthritis is hypertrophic synovium, which is commonly seen in recalcitrant stenosing tenosynovitis. The medication also can be safely administered for knee synovitis without preexisting rheumatic conditions. Therefore, the rationale of using methotrexate to treat DQVD is based on its potential effect to antagonize hypertrophic synovium. Methotrexate has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects owing to an elevated level of adenosine, which decreases pain by suppressing the production of substance P, prostaglandins, cytokines, and collagenases. Moreover, methotrexate has antifibrotic effects through the inhibition of fibroblasts. Injection of methotrexate has been widely used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis and has shown promising effectiveness. Ultrasound-guided methotrexate injection can be safely administered at least every 7 days up to 8 times for the treatment of synovitis. Therefore, in this case, methotrexate not only resolved the inflammation inside the first dorsal extensor compartment of the wrist but also reduced hypertrophy of the retinaculum by reducing fibroblast activity. This dual effect is rarely seen with corticosteroid injection, which mainly contributes to reduction of inflammation at the injection site. However, the use of methotrexate may be associated with gastrointestinal upset, bone marrow toxicity, and hepatotoxicity. It is contraindicated in cases of hepatic and renal impairment; thus, the function of both the liver and kidney should be assessed before starting methotrexate therapy. Ultrasound guidance can prevent unwanted spreading of the methotrexate, to reduce the risk of tissue necrosis and demyelinating neuropathy of the superficial radial nerve. The main limitation of the study is its case number (n = 1) and lack of a control. The beneficial effect of methotrexate could result from hydrodissection of the tendon. Therefore, a future randomized controlled trial should be conducted to investigate the true effectiveness of intrasheath methotrexate injection for DQVD.

### Ultrasound-guided steroid injections for shoulder pain | AAFP… [^116TUc9a]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical Question Does using ultrasonography to guide steroid injections into the shoulder region improve pain or function compared with using anatomic landmarks alone. Evidence-Based Answer Ultrasound-guided glucocorticoid injection for shoulder pain provides no advantage over landmark-guided or intramuscular injection in terms of pain, function, range of motion, or safety when measured within a six-week follow-up period. However, the small sample size of this review means that a clinically significant benefit cannot be ruled out. The authors of this Cochrane review analyzed five studies with 290 participants to compare ultrasound-guided steroid injection with blind or gluteal steroid injection.

Of the four trials that included participants with rotator cuff disease, subacromial bursitis, or both, three compared ultrasound-guided injection with blind injection into the subacromial bursa, and one compared ultrasound-guided subacromial injection with gluteal injection. The fifth trial included participants with adhesive capsulitis, and the injection was directed into the glenohumeral joint. No trial had more than six weeks of follow-up. Primary outcomes included pain and function. The authors found no significant differences between groups in pain reduction at any of the end points. In data pooled from three studies, range of abduction improved by about 20 degrees at two weeks with ultrasound-guided injection. However, statistical heterogeneity was considerable, and benefits were not seen at other time points.

Minor adverse events such as transient postinjection pain and facial redness were rare and occurred equally in the control and ultrasound-guided treatment groups. Only one study was assessed to have a low risk of bias; it compared ultrasound-guided subacromial injection with systemic gluteal injection. 2 No differences in pain or function were noted between groups during a six-week follow-up, suggesting that any benefit of the injection was likely from its systemic effects and not dependent on injection location. 3 A recent review discusses the most useful techniques for accurately diagnosing rotator cuff disease. 4 Future studies should address glenohumeral arthritis. Confirmatory studies also should be performed to compare local injection with systemic intramuscular injection or oral glucocorticoid use.

### Effectiveness of ultrasound-guided versus anatomic landmark-guided corticosteroid injection on pain, physical function, and safety in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111xjShV]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy and safety of ultrasound-guided versus anatomic landmark-guided corticosteroid injection for the treatment of subacromial impingement syndrome.

Design

PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, ClinicalTrials.gov, CBM, CNKI, and Wanfang databases were searched from inception to August 15, 2021, for randomized controlled trials comparing ultrasound-guided versus anatomic landmark-guided injections of corticosteroids for the treatment of subacromial impingement syndrome.

Results

Twelve randomized controlled trials with 891 patients were included in this study; 454 patients received ultrasound-guided injections and 437 received anatomic landmark-guided injections. Pooled results showed that ultrasound-guided injection was more beneficial for pain relief (10 trials; mean difference = -0.58; 95% confidence interval = -1.05 to -0.10; P = 0.017) and functional improvement (11 trials; standard mean difference = -0.84; 95% confidence interval = -1.41 to -0.27; P = 0.004). There was no significant difference in shoulder range of motion. In the subgroup analysis, there was a significant difference in pain relief and functional improvement at 6–8 wks and with methylprednisolone.

Conclusions

Ultrasound-guided injection of corticosteroids is potentially superior to anatomic landmark-guided injection in improving the clinical symptoms of subacromial impingement syndrome; however, these findings should be interpreted with some caution as the quality of evidence was rated as moderate to very low.

### Image-guided versus blind glucocorticoid injection for shoulder pain [^1167AWgC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Traditionally, glucocorticoid injection for the treatment of shoulder pain has been performed guided by anatomical landmarks alone. With the advent of readily available imaging tools such as ultrasound, image-guided injections have increasingly become accepted into routine care. While there is some evidence that the use of imaging improves accuracy, it is unclear from current evidence whether or not it improves patient-relevant outcomes.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to assess whether image-guided glucocorticoid injections improve patient-relevant outcomes compared to landmark-guided or systemic intramuscular injections in patients with shoulder pain.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, via The Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (Ovid), and EMBASE (Ovid) to June 2011. We also searched the World Health Organisation International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (http://www.who.int/trialsearch/Default.aspx) to identify ongoing trials and screened reference lists of retrieved review articles and trials to identify potentially relevant studies.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials that compared image-guided glucocorticoid injection to landmark-guided or systemic intramuscular injection. Outcomes of interest included pain, function, range of motion, proportion of participants with overall improvement and adverse events. There were no restrictions on language or date of publication.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the studies for inclusion, extracted the data and performed a risk of bias assessment. Disagreement about inclusion or exclusion of individual studies and risk of bias was resolved by a third review author.

Main Results

Five studies (290 participants) were included in the review. The image-guided groups in all trials used ultrasound to guide injection. Four studies included participants with rotator cuff disease; in three the comparator was local landmarks to direct injection into the subacromial bursa and in the fourth the comparator was systemic intramuscular injection into the upper gluteal muscles in the buttock region. One study included participants with adhesive capsulitis and injection was directed into the glenohumeral joint by either ultrasound or anatomical landmark guidance. No significant differences between groups were observed with respect to reduction in pain at one to two weeks (two trials, 146 participants, standardized mean difference (SMD) -1.44, 95% CI -4.14 to 1.26), or function at one to two weeks (two trials, 146 participants, SMD 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.29 to 3.20; back-translated to mean difference (MD) 4 points, 95% CI -5 to 13, on a 0 to 100 point scale, higher score means better function) or six weeks (three trials, 207 participants, SMD 0.63, 95% CI -0.06 to 1.33; back-translated to MD -3 points, 95% CI -11 to 5, on a 0 to 100 point scale) and the sensitivity analyses did not alter these results. While there was a significant difference between groups with respect to reduction in pain at six weeks favouring image guidance (three trials, 207 participants, SMD -0.80, 95% CI -1.46 to -0.14), there was considerable statistical heterogeneity and after removing trials with inadequate allocation concealment and inadequate blinding in a sensitivity analysis, the difference was no longer significant (one trial, 106 participants, MD -0.60 points, 95% CI -1.44 to 0.24 points on a 9-point scale). No statistical difference in adverse events between groups was identified (10/104 image-guided group versus 16/103 comparator; risk ratio (RR) 0.55, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.85). Minor adverse events reported included transient post-injection pain, facial redness and warmth.

Authors' Conclusions

Based upon moderate evidence from five trials, our review was unable to establish any advantage in terms of pain, function, shoulder range of motion or safety, of ultrasound-guided glucocorticoid injection for shoulder disorders over either landmark-guided or intramuscular injection. The lack of any added benefit of ultrasound guided subacromial bursal injection over glucocorticoid injection administered into the upper gluteal muscles of the buttock suggests that the benefits of glucocorticoid may arise through systemic rather than local effects. Therefore, although ultrasound guidance may improve the accuracy of injection to the putative site of pathology in the shoulder, it is not clear that this improves its efficacy to justify the significant added cost.

Hand, hip, and knee osteoarthritis — intraarticular glucocorticoid injections — are conditionally recommended for patients with knee, hip, and/or hand OA and are conditionally recommended over other forms of intraarticular injection, including hyaluronic acid preparations, with head-to-head comparisons few but evidence for glucocorticoid efficacy of considerably higher quality than that for other agents.

Modified US Preventive Services Task Force levels of certainty regarding net benefit — definitions for evidence strength are outlined for joint pain interventions. High certainty is described as evidence with "consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representative care populations with joint pain", with conclusions "unlikely to be strongly affected by the results of future studies". Moderate certainty is when "the available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the intervention on health outcomes, but confidence in the estimate is constrained by such factors", and "the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change, and this change may be large enough to alter the conclusion". Low certainty indicates "the available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes".

Pain

Reductions in pain level measured by VAS or bodily pain scale was reported by those studies that measured pain as an outcome, albeit not all were statistically significant (3/6, 50%). At 30‐day follow‐up in Iannone et al's study, only the 1:4 dilution cohort experienced a statistically significant reduction of 1.8 points in the VAS pain score (P = 0.035). Long‐term follow‐up data at 60‐ and 90‐days found overall statistically significant reductions in VAS pain (P = 0.013). Salvador‐Rodriguez et al noted an overall reduction of 1.5 in the pain score at 12‐week follow up. Fania et al reported a mean reduction of 3.1 points in VAS pain at 4‐week follow up (P = 0.027). The pooled mean pain score at baseline was 4.8 out of 10, with a mean score reduction of 1.8 across the 3 studies. Meta‐analysis of change in these pain scales (Figure 7) demonstrated a standardized mean difference of −0.57 (95% CI: [−0.76, −0.37], P = 0.0013). When scaled to the VAS pain scale (0 represents no pain, 10 represents worse pain imaginable), the mean difference was −1.65 out of 10 points from baseline to follow‐up pain scores (95% CI [−2.22, −1.08]).

Shoulder intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) and subacromial-subdeltoid bursa (SASDB) injections — dose response and comparative efficacy: An randomized controlled trial (RCT) showed no difference in efficacy between triamcinolone acetonide (TA) 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg for IACS with reduction in SPADI at 6 months. In adhesive capsulitis/shoulder joint stiffness, two RCTs showed no difference between TA 20 mg and 40 mg, with one trial reporting equal effectiveness up to 12 weeks and another noting relief up to 12 months. For SASDB, in 79 subjects with primary osteoarthritis/full-thickness rotator cuff tear, ultrasound-guided (USG) TA 20 mg or 40 mg versus placebo at 8 weeks showed improved pain VAS and active ROM over placebo without differences between TA doses. Another SASDB RCT randomized 62 subjects by preparation (methylprednisolone acetate [MPA] vs TA) and dose (20 mg vs 40 mg) and found no differences between groups by preparation or dose. A systematic review showed equal efficacy between NSAIDs and corticosteroids in SASDB injections.

### The impact of ultrasound on the use and efficacy of intraarticular glucocorticoid injections in early rheumatoid arthritis: secondary analyses from a randomized trial examining the benefit of ultrasound in a clinical tight control regimen [^1116FwJs]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

Intraarticular glucocorticoid injections are common in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment. This study was undertaken to investigate whether ultrasound in combination with clinical examination is better than clinical examination alone at identifying joints that will benefit from intraarticular injections, and to compare the efficacy of ultrasound-guided versus palpation-guided procedures.

Methods

In the treat-to-target Aiming for Remission in Rheumatoid Arthritis: a Randomised Trial Examining the Benefit of Ultrasonography in a Clinical Tight Control Regimen (ARCTIC), patients with early RA were randomized 1:1 to follow-up with or without ultrasound. In addition to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, intraarticular glucocorticoids were used to treat inflamed joints. The distribution of injections was assessed in both study groups. The relationship of clinical and ultrasound findings at the time of injection with treatment efficacy was examined, with non-swollen joint at the next visit as the outcome measure. Treatment success was compared across study groups to evaluate ultrasound-guided versus palpation-guided procedures.

Results

More injections were administered in the ultrasound group than in the conventional strategy group (n = 770 versus 548), especially in intercarpal joints (n = 58 versus 5) and metatarsophalangeal joints (n = 200 versus 104). Injecting clinically swollen joints without power Doppler (PD) activity on ultrasound was not efficacious compared to not injecting (odds ratio [OR] 1.3; P = 0.59). Efficacy was best in swollen joints (OR 9.0; P = 0.001) and non-swollen joints (OR 8.4; P = 0.016) with moderate PD activity. Treatment success was similar for the ultrasound-guided and palpation-guided procedures.

Conclusion

Our findings indicate that the efficacy of intraarticular glucocorticoid injections varies according to ultrasound findings at the time of injection, supporting the use of ultrasound as a tool to select joints that will benefit from intraarticular injections. However, ultrasound needle guidance was not superior to palpation guidance.

Discussion

The developing bone and joints in children have a typical appearance which changes with the different stages of the growth. For the physicians performing joint injections in children it is very important to be familiar with these findings. The aim of this article was to describe the technique that we use to perform joint injections of a group of joints which most of the time can be injected using US as the only image guidance technique.

### Corticosteroid injections for common musculoskeletal conditions… [^1121QGHZ]. AAFP (2015). Low credibility.

Corticosteroid injections are beneficial in improving short-term outcomes. 35–38 Triamcinolone injections result in improved symptom scores and functional status at one week compared with placebo injection. 35 Methylprednisolone injection reduces symptom severity at 10 weeks compared with placebo. 36 At two weeks, systemic corticosteroids and local injections provide similar improvements in symptoms; however, patients who receive injections have significantly better symptom scores by eight and 12 weeks. 39 Local corticosteroid injection and oral NSAIDs with a neutral wrist splint result in similar short-term improvements in symptom severity. 40 Two corticosteroid injections provide no additional improvement compared with only a single injection.
41. Long-term outcomes are mixed in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome who are treated with corticosteroid injections; up to one-half have symptom recurrence.

35 Ultrasonography may improve the duration of effect and other parameters, but at significant cost. 42 The need for surgery at one year is reduced with corticosteroid injection, but a significant number of patients eventually undergo surgical treatment. 36 Physicians can tailor their treatment recommendations to the patient's preferences. Corticosteroid injection is an option as long as patients are aware that it may not prevent recurrence or the need for surgery. Cure rates after corticosteroid injection are generally moderate, ranging from 54% to 86%. 48, 49 Compared with placebo injections, corticosteroids result in less triggering and improved pain at one week, and these effects persist through one year. 50 In one study, corticosteroid injections resulted in less topical and joint pain at one week and one month compared with percutaneous and open releases; however, patients who underwent surgery had better outcomes at six months.

55 Treatment with intra-articular corticosteroid injections in the outpatient setting is challenging given the need for radiographic guidance. 56 A small double-blind study comparing corticosteroid and placebo injections using an ultrasound-guided anterolateral approach showed improvement in pain on walking at two and four weeks for the corticosteroid group, although that improvement disappeared by three months. 57 Fluoroscopically guided corticosteroid injections provide improvement in pain, stiffness, and physical function at two months compared with placebo injections. 55 Most primary care physicians should consider orthopedic referral for patients who desire injection treatment for hip osteoarthritis. Knee Osteoarthritis Guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology conditionally recommend the use of intra-articular corticosteroid injections for treatment of knee osteoarthritis.

### The clinical effectiveness of intra-articular corticosteroids for arthritis of the lower limb in juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a systematic review [^112mX2W4]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2014). Low credibility.

A novel finding from this review was that several studies employed image-guidance to aid their IACIs. Ultrasonography-guided injections also have been identified as a useful imaging technique for IACIs as they permit the real-time guidance of the needle and allow confirmation of correct deposition of steroid. These studies concluded the use of imaging techniques ensured correct needle placement and guided IACIs were superior to standard 'blinded' injection and aspiration techniques. These studies also raise further questions surrounding image-guidance concerning whether or not image-guidance can reduce the rate of complications associated with IACIs. At present there have been no RCTs comparing guided and blindly administered IACIs in JIA.

The conclusions from this review contribute to the evidence base in support of current JIA management practices through aggressive and early intervention to reduce disease activity. This highlights inconsistencies and evidence gaps concerning the efficacy of IACIs in JIA. It also provides valuable additional and contemporary information through a robust and systematic approach relative to previous reviews. While investigating the efficacy of IACIs, post-injection procedure was included in the study description as a contextual factor. This did not occur in previous reviews. Not all studies included a post-injection technique. Those studies that did include post injection procedure are described in Table 3. However, the lack of consistency among the described injection procedures makes it difficult for comparison to make a consensus. This is an area which requires further research.

There were a number of limitations for this systematic review that should be acknowledged. Language was limited to English which is generally not recommended, but is often difficult to overcome. There were two identified studies which had to be excluded based on language barriers (Spanish and Russian languages) that could have potentially had an impact on the findings of this review. It is acknowledged that a number of studies were identified by hand-searching that were not identified using the detailed search strategy. The original search strategy was reviewed to investigate whether or not it was adequate. The minor problem with the search strategy was subsequently attributed to an indexing issue within the databases that could not be overcome by altering the search strategy. However, in spite of this limitation, the pragmatic nature of the reviewing strategy permitted important and relevant studies which met the inclusion criteria to be identified by hand.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of selected ultrasound-guided procedures [^113ibTfR]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound-guided joint procedures — equipment and preprocedure evaluation indicate that clinicians should consider using a small-footprint (hockey stick) transducer in the wrist-hand and ankle-foot region if available, and clinicians should physically examine the target joint before aspiration or injection to identify and localize any intra-articular fluid, with preliminary ultrasound scanning seeking to localize intra-articular fluid. Multiple approaches are typically available to enter a joint using ultrasound guidance, clinicians should recognize that many ultrasound-guided joint aspirations and injections do not use the same approaches as traditional non–image-guided techniques, and the choice of joint entry site is situation specific and depends on patient position and regional anatomy, localization of fluid (if any), the proximity of neurovascular structures, and clinician preference. Whereas ultrasound-guided joint injections may be performed with small-gauge needles, larger-gauge needles are recommended for aspiration (eg, 20 gauge or larger).

### Ultrasound guidance allows accurate needle placement and aspiration from small joints in patients with early inflammatory arthritis [^117WWmQz]. Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the accuracy of palpation-guided and high frequency ultrasound-guided needle placement in small joints and to develop a technique to obtain synovial fluid from these joints for diagnosis and research.

Methods

The accuracy of needle placement during palpation-guided proximal interphalangeal (PIP) or metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint injection was assessed. This was compared with the accuracy of ultrasound-guided needle placement. A joint lavage technique was developed to obtain synovial fluid from these joints.

Results

Needle positioning was intra-articular in 59% of palpation-guided injections (6/12 PIP and 4/5 MCP joints). No fluid could be aspirated prior to injection. With ultrasound guidance, initial needle placement was intra-articular in 96% of cases (24/26 PIP and 27/27 MCP joints). Synovial fluid cells were lavaged from 63% of joints (19/25 PIP and 14/27 MCP joints). In only one case was a large effusion seen and this was aspirated directly.

Conclusions

The use of high frequency ultrasound to guide needle placement within a small joint allows for significantly greater accuracy than a palpation-guided approach. When followed by lavage, synovial fluid cells and diluted synovial fluid can be obtained from the majority of small joints. This has important clinical and research implications.

Trigger finger CSI — A dose–response study showed better outcomes with 20 mg triamcinolone acetonide than 5 mg at 3 and 6 months, with no differences at 9 and 12 months. A 2018 systematic review found moderate evidence for benefit in the short term (0–3 months). A prospective case-control study found no differences between USG and palpation-guided injections at 6 weeks or 6 months, but there was a significant increase in procedural time and cost with US.

Ultrasound-guided (USG) wrist and hand CSI — USG distal radioulnar joint injections were more accurate than landmark-guided (100% vs 75.8%), though clinical outcomes did not differ in that study. A meta-analysis of four studies found USG more likely to decrease pain and increase function at a 6-week follow-up interval, but in one study only 3% of injected joints were small joints.

American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy and safety of ultrasound-guided versus anatomic landmark–guided corticosteroid injection for the treatment of subacromial impingement syndrome.

Design

PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, CBM, CNKI, and Wanfang databases were searched from inception to August 15, 2021, for randomized controlled trials comparing ultrasound-guided versus anatomic landmark–guided injections of corticosteroids for the treatment of subacromial impingement syndrome.

Results

Twelve randomized controlled trials with 891 patients were included in this study; 454 patients received ultrasound-guided injections and 437 received anatomic landmark–guided injections. Pooled results showed that ultrasound-guided injection was more beneficial for pain relief (10 trials; mean difference = −0.58; 95% confidence interval = −1.05 to −0.10; P = 0.017) and functional improvement (11 trials; standard mean difference = −0.84; 95% confidence interval = −1.41 to −0.27; P = 0.004). There was no significant difference in shoulder range of motion. In the subgroup analysis, there was a significant difference in pain relief and functional improvement at 6–8 wks and with methylprednisolone.

Conclusions

Ultrasound-guided injection of corticosteroids is potentially superior to anatomic landmark–guided injection in improving the clinical symptoms of subacromial impingement syndrome; however, these findings should be interpreted with some caution as the quality of evidence was rated as moderate to very low.

### Therapeutic and diagnostic joint injections [^112GcYoC]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2008). Low credibility.

Joint injections remain a valuable modality in the detection and treatment of intra-articular pathology. Over the past several decades, various diagnostic and therapeutic indications for joint injections have been developed. Imaging guidance for joint injection generally increases accuracy in joint aspirations and diagnostic blocks. Confirming intra-articular placement with steroid injections improves efficacy and reduces local complications. Administering intra-articular contrast can improve the diagnostic performance of CT and MR imaging in many circumstances. This article focuses on the rationale for injections at different sites and describes different fluoroscopic approaches for common joints.

### Ultrasound-guided steroid injection of the pisotriquetral joint: a multidisciplinary effort [^114LsPKu]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

From the perspective of a multidisciplinary team, the authors describe the first reported use of ultrasound guidance for steroid injection into the pisotriquetral joint to relieve wrist pain of a person with spinal cord injury undergoing acute inpatient rehabilitation. Musculoskeletal ultrasound guidance was used to improve the accuracy of a corticosteroid injection of the pisotriquetral joint and the basal thumb in a 70-year-old man with paraplegia experiencing multifocal degenerative wrist pain. There was no bleeding or bruising after the injections, and the patient reported complete pain resolution 1 wk after the injections, which continued for over 1 yr. A multidisciplinary team was key in diagnosis, selection of treatment, and evaluation of treatment effect. Corticosteroid injection of the pisotriquetral joint under ultrasound guidance can be used as a treatment modality for managing wrist pain stemming from that joint. Further investigation and studies evaluating the use of ultrasound versus other imaging modalities for injection of the wrist are indicated.

Intra-articular corticosteroid injections (IACS) — role of imaging: Ultrasound-guided techniques result in more accurate intra-articular needle placement than landmark-based techniques (Level of certainty: high). There are no significant differences in accuracy between ultrasound-guided and fluoroscopy-guided peripheral joint corticosteroid injections (Level of certainty: low). Compared with landmark-based techniques, use of image guidance may be associated with less pain on injection, improved patient satisfaction, and better short-term clinical outcomes (Level of certainty: low). Use of imaging guidance may be associated with fewer adverse events, including damage to periosteum and intravascular injection, after diagnostic or therapeutic arthrocentesis (Level of certainty: low). Image-guided techniques may be preferred for accuracy of intra-articular corticosteroid injections, especially in individuals with morbid obesity (Grade C).

### Ultrasound-guided injection of high molecular weight hyaluronic acid versus corticosteroid in management of plantar fasciitis: a 24-week randomized clinical trial [^1152h2FV]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that compares the effects of US-guided injection of CS and HA in patients with chronic PF at 6 weeks and 24th-week follow-ups.

The results of this study show that there was no significant difference between the two groups for VAS, PPT, FAAM, FFI and fascia thickness measured by the US before treatment. However, 6 weeks after the treatment, plantar fascia thickness measured by US (P < 0.001) and PPT (P < 0.001) became significantly better in the CS group compared to the HA group. Also, 24 weeks after the treatment, no significant difference between any variable was observed in both groups. In this study, no serious adverse events were seen in any of the groups.

CS and HA were both effective treatments for PF and can improve pain and function with no superiority in 24-week follow-up; however, CS seems to have a faster trend of improvement in the short term.

Steroid injection is commonly used to treat PF. There is some evidence that injected CS were effective in providing transitory pain relief. The rapid effects of steroid injection on pain inspire its common use in treating PF. However, current scientific evidence shows that steroid injection should be avoided in treating PF in athletes because of its greater risk of causing spontaneous ruptures.

The efficacy of CS in treating chronic inflammation has been well demonstrated. Intralesional injection of CS in chronic PF (defined as persistence of symptoms more than 8 weeks despite conservative care) has been shown to be effective. In a review by Ang TW, the effectiveness of CS injection in the treatment of PF was evaluated. All placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showed a significant reduction in pain with the use of CS injections. However, it is evident from these studies that the effects of CS injections are usually short term, lasting only for a duration of 4–12 weeks.

### Ultrasound-guided vs. blind steroid injections in carpal tunnel syndrome: a single-blind randomized prospective study [^115f5Jf6]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and the safety of ultrasound (US)-guided vs. blind steroid injections in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).

Design

This prospective randomized single-blind clinical trial included 46 patients with CTS (46 affected median nerves). The subjects were randomized-to either the US-guided or the blind injection group-before they received 40 mg of methylprednisolone. They were evaluated using the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire symptom/function at baseline and at 6 wks and 12 wks after injection, and the side effects were noted.

Results

The symptom severity and functional status scores improved significantly in both groups at 6 wks after treatment, and these improvements persisted at 12 wks after treatment (all P < 0.05). The improvement in symptom severity scores in the US-guided group at 12 wks was higher than in the palpation-guided group (P < 0.05). Average time to symptom relief was shorter in the US-guided group (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of side effects (P > 0.05).

Conclusions

Although both US-guided and blind steroid injections were effective in reducing the symptoms of CTS and improving the function, an earlier onset/better improvement of symptom relief suggests that US-guided steroid injection may be more effective than are blind injections in CTS.

### Effect of glucocorticosteroid injections in tennis elbow verified on colour Doppler ultrasonography: evidence of inflammation [^113XAUFA]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

It has previously been reported that lateral epicondylitis may be diagnosed with colour Doppler ultrasonography (US) by detecting hyperaemia inside the common extensor origin (CEO). This study reports on the association between Doppler US findings and the short-term response of US-guided corticosteroid injection in patients with LE.

Design

Case-only, blinded intervention study.

Setting

Secondary care at a government hospital.

Patients

62 patients with LE verified by colour Doppler US.

Intervention

One US-guided corticosteroid injection was given into the CEO.

Main Outcome Measures

Patients were evaluated at baseline before the injection and at 2 weeks of follow-up. Outcome measures were changes in pain score and US parameters (resistive index (RI) and the amount of colour within the CEO). Prognosticators for outcome were: use of computer mouse, symptom duration, elbow strain, RI, colour fraction, Likert pain score, pain at rest, pain during activity, age, height, weight, disease in dominant versus nondominant arm.

Results

All but one patient experienced improvement of general elbow pain perception at follow-up at 2 weeks. In parallel, Doppler US showed significant reduction in colour fraction (mean (standard deviation) with 95% confidence limits: baseline 0.14 (0.10), at follow-up 0.02 (0.02), p < 0.0001). All but five patients showed a decrease in colour fraction; 74% decreased to 0. No clinical or US parameter could distinguish responders from non-responders.

Conclusion

Corticosteroid injection has a marked short-term effect on pain and Doppler parameters. The reduction in hyperaemia mediated by an anti-inflammatory drug can be interpreted as evidence of an inflammatory component in LE.

### American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement: interventional musculoskeletal ultrasound in sports medicine [^114oM4D5]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound-guided injections (USGIs) for multiple joints — efficacy and cost-effectiveness — are supported by tabled evidence indicating that in joints with inflammatory arthritis, "2 studies: USGIs are more efficacious than LMGIs", and in painful joints, "1 study: USGIs are more efficacious than LMGIs". For cost-effectiveness in joints with inflammatory arthritis, "1 study: USGIs are more cost-effective than LMGIs". Overall, "these findings suggest that USGIs into inflamed or painful joints are more accurate, less painful, more efficacious, and are less expensive than LMGIs", although "further research is required to confirm these findings due to the limited number of studies".

### Synovitis scoring in hand osteoarthritis with ultrasonography: the performance of the global OMERACT / EULAR ultrasound synovitis score (GLOESS) is comparable to synovial thickening alone [^117Xobpo]. RMD Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

Data from the Hand Osteoarthritis Prednisolone Efficacy (HOPE) study, a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial, were used. Full details and the protocol were published earlier. The study received approval by the medical ethics committees at the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) and Zuyderland Medical Center (approval number P15.096). All patients provided written informed consent.

Study population

The HOPE study included adults with symptomatic hand OA following the ACR criteria. Furthermore, eligible patients were required to have signs of inflammation (≥ 1 distal interphalangeal joint (DIP)/proximal interphalangeal joint (PIP) with soft swelling or erythema, ≥ 1 PIP/DIP with a positive Doppler signal or ≥ 1 PIP/DIP with synovial thickening of grade ≥ 2 on ultrasound investigation of digits 2–5) and finger pain of ≥ 30 mm on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) with a flare-up after washout of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The flare-up criterium was amended due to slow accrual during the trial, so that patients without a flare-up but who fulfilled all other inclusion criteria and fulfilled a more stringent pain (VAS ≥ 40 mm) and ultrasound (positive Doppler signal) criterion were also included.

Exclusion criteria consisted of pain predominantly located in the thumb base rather than fingers; presence of fibromyalgia or chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease, or seropositivity for rheumatoid factor or anticyclic citrullinated protein antibodies as well as safety concerns. Finally patients who used systemic or local immunomodulating drugs including corticosteroid injections or received hyaluronic acid injections in the thumb base up to 90 days before start of the trial were excluded.

Randomisation, blinding and intervention

Patients were randomly (1:1) assigned to receive either prednisolone or placebo (identical in appearance, smell and taste) using a block randomisation scheme with a fixed block size of six. Prednisolone and placebo were self-administered in a dose of 10 mg per day for 6 weeks, after which medication was tapered to cessation in 2 weeks. Paracetamol (as rescue) and a stable dosage of chondroitin sulfate, glucosamine, bisphosphonate, tetracycline or estrogens were allowed. NSAIDs and injections with glucocorticoids or hyaluronic acid, intramuscular or intra-articular, at any location, were not allowed. Patients were advised against starting non-pharmacological interventions during the trial.

Patients, outcome assessors and data analysts remained blinded for treatment allocation until the database was locked.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) imaging — image-guided intraarticular glucocorticoid injections: Imaging guidance is conditionally recommended for use with intraarticular glucocorticoid injections of joints that are difficult to access, or to specifically localize the distribution of inflammation. The recommendation includes ultrasound and/or fluoroscopy, and examples of joints that may be difficult to access include sacroiliac joints, hips, TMJs, shoulder, midfoot, and subtalar joints. The recommendation is conditional because it is dependent on the skill of the practitioner, availability of imaging, costs, and risk of delay in treatment.

Trigger point injections (TPIs) — ultrasound (US) guidance and clinical outcomes — may be performed without imaging by manual palpation to elicit a twitch response and then inject, with US imaging showing echogenic skin, mixed echogenic adipose, and hypoechoic marbled muscle. Studies report US-guided TPIs have improved accuracy versus landmark injections and favorable pain relief versus blind injections; a randomized controlled study found pain scores, neck disability index, and shoulder pain disability index significantly better in the US-guided group. In an emergency department setting, US-guided TPIs improved short-term pain scores and reduced rescue medications compared with multimodal oral analgesic therapy, and a small study showed landmark technique TPIs are superior to intravenous NSAIDs.

American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

Quality Assessment

Of the 12 included studies, one was rated as having a "low risk of bias" in all domains, and the other studies were classified as having an "unclear risk of bias" for at least one aspect or a "high risk of bias" for at least two aspects. The results of the risk of bias are presented in the Supplementary Material Appendix D (Supplemental Digital Content 4). According to the GRADE system, the quality of the evidence of the included studies was very low, low, or moderate. For pain, the certainty of the evidence was moderate. The evidence was downgraded because of the risk of bias. For function, the certainty of the evidence was very low. The evidence was downgraded because of the risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision. For shoulder ROM, the certainty of the evidence was low or very low. The evidence was downgraded because of the risk of bias, inconsistency, and imprecision. The GRADE results are presented in Table 2.

Effect of Intervention: Pain Relief

Ten trials. (795 participants) were included in the analysis. Moderate certainty evidence showed that the USG injection had a small but significant effect on the reduction of pain (10 trials; MD = −0.58; 95% CI = −1.05 to −0.10; P = 0.017) with statistically significant heterogeneity (I 2 = 76.7%, P = 0.000; Fig. 2). In the subgroup analysis, follow-up duration of 6–8 wks (8 trials; MD = −0.72; 95% CI = −1.19 to −0.25; P = 0.002) and use of methylprednisolone (8 trials; MD = −0.79; 95% CI = −1.28 to −0.29; P = 0.002) and betamethasone (1 trial; MD = −0.94; 95% CI = −1.58 to −0.30; P = 0.004) showed evidence of a significant difference in pain relief (Table 3). Age and other subgroup factors had no effect on pain relief. No significant changes in heterogeneity or overall effects were observed in the sensitivity analysis (Supplementary Material Appendix E, Supplemental Digital Content 5).

Small joint injections — evidence statements indicate that ultrasound (US) guidance is superior to landmark-based guidance when performing small joint injections (Level of certainty: high). The use of intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) injection for osteoarthritis of the carpometacarpal joints of the hands and wrists does not result in short-term or long-term improvement in pain or function, while IACS results in less pain with movement in interphalangeal joints of the hand (Level of certainty: moderate). In rheumatoid arthritis of the joints of the hands and wrists, IACS results in short-term (12 weeks) or long-term (12 months) improvement in pain, function, and inflammation (Level of certainty: high). Trigger finger corticosteroid injection (CSI) confers a short-term to intermediate-term (3–6 months) benefit in resolving symptoms (Level of certainty: moderate). For trigger finger injections, triamcinolone, 20 mg, is superior to 5 mg and 10 mg (Level of certainty: low). In rheumatic inflammatory diseases such as spondyloarthritis, plantar fascia injections with corticosteroids are beneficial in the treatment of pain and inflammation (Level of certainty: low).

### Do ultrasound guided trochanteric bursa injections of corticosteroid for greater trochanteric pain syndrome provide sustained benefit and are imaging features associated with treatment response? [^112qmHwp]. Clinical Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Aim

To assess intra-bursal corticosteroid injections (ICSI) efficacy and duration of action in the management of greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS). The secondary aim was to identify patient and ultrasound (US) features predictive of treatment response.

Materials and Methods

Consecutive prospectively recruited patients undergoing US-guided ICSI therapy for GTPS received baseline pre-injection questionnaires assessing pain at rest and activity, demographics and comorbidities. Baseline US and radiography findings were reported prospectively. Follow-up was performed at 6 weeks and 6 and 12 months, and change in pain scores assessed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Logistic regression examined associations between demographics, US findings, and a clinically significant reduction in pain score (≥ 50%).

Results

Over 6 months, 127 patients were recruited with a median age of 63.5 years and 90% were female. The greatest pain reduction was between baseline and 6 weeks at activity (median 8 versus 5, p < 0.001). The majority of patients noted a reduction in pain score, but the percentage of patients receiving a ≥ 50% reduction at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months for pain at rest was 41%, 37%, and 36%, respectively. Regression models suggested only gluteus medius bursitis was weakly associated with pain reduction.

Conclusion

ICSIs confer a benefit in pain reduction to a large proportion of patients in the short term, but this may not be reduced by a clinically significant amount. This small effect size and lack of predictive imaging features suggests initial management including subsequent steroid injection could be provided without imaging guidance in the majority of cases.

### Joint and soft tissue injections… [^115HQqci]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

6, 7 Evidence supports ultrasonography to improve the accuracy of injection of the acromioclavicular joint, biceps tendon sheath, glenohumeral joint, and hip joint. 8–10 A targeted soft tissue diagnostic injection providing immediate relief of more than 50% of preprocedural pain clarifies the diagnosis. CORTICOSTEROID Indications. High-quality evidence supports the use of corticosteroid injections for adhesive capsulitis, de Quervain tenosynovitis, and trigger finger. 13–17 In a systematic review and network meta-analysis evaluating pharmacologic treatments for adhesive capsulitis, the most significant benefit was found in patients with less than two months of symptoms who had intra-articular glenohumeral corticosteroid injections or corticosteroid injections and capsule distention.

13 For de Quervain tenosynovitis, tendon sheath corticosteroid injections alone provided greater pain relief compared with corticosteroid injections with splinting, splinting alone, rest, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in patients 38 to 50 years of age. 14 In patients who are pregnant and breastfeeding with de Quervain tenosynovitis, corticosteroid injection is superior to thumb spica splinting. 17 In a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of 50 patients, tendon sheath corticosteroid injections for trigger finger had a significantly higher success rate compared with normal saline injection in decreasing the frequency of triggering and severity of symptoms. 15 Corticosteroids are also used to treat nerve entrapment; however, evidence suggests that benefits may be attributed to corticosteroid and physical tissue distortion. Cartilage damage from corticosteroid injections is time-dependent and dose-dependent.

66, 67 One study found that repeated treatments with intra-articular triamcinolone acetonide contributed to higher rates of cartilage loss and progressive joint space narrowing over two years compared with placebo. 31 However, this study does not reflect routine care because patients were treated with corticosteroid injections regardless of symptoms. 31, 66 A population-based cohort study followed patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis over five years who received intra-articular corticosteroid or hyaluronic acid injections only when symptomatic; there was no significant change in cartilage thickness when corticosteroid injections were used only for symptomatic treatment of osteoarthritis flare-ups. 67.

### American Medical Society for Sports Medicine position statement: interventional musculoskeletal ultrasound in sports medicine [^113VpUjM]. Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine (2015). Medium credibility.

American Medical Society for Sports Medicine — Efficacy of ultrasound-guided injections (USGIs) versus landmark-guided injections (LMGIs) is stated as: USGIs are more efficacious than LMGIs (SORT Evidence Rating = B). Reported evidence indicates USGIs are more efficacious than LMGIs in large joints, inflamed joints, SA-SD bursa, carpal tunnel, and first dorsal wrist compartment tendon sheath. Only 1 study evaluated USG intermediate joint injections (AC joint) relative to LMGIs and found no difference in efficacy, and no studies have compared USGI small joint injections to LMGIs; therefore further research is required. Corticosteroid systemic effects can confound efficacy comparisons; in a study comparing a gluteal corticosteroid injection with a USG SA-SD bursa injection for rotator cuff disease, both groups showed similar primary outcome improvements although some secondary outcomes were better with USGI, and systemic corticosteroid effects may make it difficult to detect efficacy differences between accurately and inaccurately placed injections.

### Rotator cuff tendinopathy diagnosis, nonsurgical medical care, and rehabilitation: a clinical practice guideline [^115Z46Ay]. The Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy (2025). High credibility.

Rotator cuff (RC) tendinopathy — ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injections versus landmark or intramuscular approaches provide small short-term pain reductions without clear disability benefit and uncertain clinical importance. A CPG reported that ultrasound-guided corticosteroid injections significantly reduce pain and disability compared to landmark-guided injections in the short term (6 weeks), although the differences are probably not clinically meaningful. A Cochrane review reported moderate-certainty evidence of reduced pain (MD, –0.58/10; 95% CI: –1.05, –0.11; 12 RCTs; n = 777) but not disability (MD, –5.06/100; 95% CI: –13.35, 3.23; 11 RCTs; n = 678) compared with landmark or intramuscular injections in the short term, and low-certainty evidence of no significant differences in quality of life or adverse events.

### Effectiveness of ultrasound-guided versus anatomic landmark-guided corticosteroid injection on pain, physical function, and safety in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1162Ftv1]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2022). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

This systematic review and meta-analysis of 12 studies involving 891 participants (USG group: 454 participants; ALG group: 437 participants) suggested that USG corticosteroid injection for management of SIS resulted in more effective pain relief and functional improvement than ALG injections; however, there was no significant difference in shoulder ROM. In the subgroup analysis, follow-up of 6–8 wks and use of methylprednisolone showed evidence of a significant difference in pain relief and functional improvement.

Our findings are in consistent with those of several previously published systematic reviews. Several mechanisms have been suggested to explain the significantly greater improvement in pain reduction and functional gain in the USG group. The main mechanism is the greater accuracy of USG versus ALG for all shoulder girdle joints, which led to improved efficacy in outcome measures of pain and function. Another important factor resulting in the improvement to consider is the increased patient comfort and less needle manipulation with USG injections, although it was not assessed across all studies. Ultrasound-guided injections also provide real-time monitoring during needle placement without any risk of radiation exposure. Furthermore, a short-term retention of the therapeutic efficacy may exist as reported by the findings in our subgroup analysis, and another systematic review measured the changes between 6-wk follow-up and baseline VAS and shoulder function scores. However, several factors should be considered when interpreting these positive findings such as the varied quality of included studies, inclusion of specific populations with small sample sizes, substantial heterogeneity across studies, and small clinical effect. The reasons for these weaknesses could be attributed to different periods of follow-up, heterogeneous pathologies of painful shoulder, inadequate patient blinding potentially causing bias, and placebo effect. In our study, although there was an evidence of substantial heterogeneity among the included trials, our sensitivity analysis detected no changes in the levels of heterogeneity and effect, and the results of publication bias confirmed the robustness.

### Ultrasound-guided hydrogel injection provides better therapeutic effects after hand tendon surgery than intraoperative injection: a randomized controlled trial [^116p8c7L]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Hydrogels are used to provide a barrier against peritendinous adhesion formation, but when implanted intraoperatively, they degrade rapidly and aggravate early inflammatory pain. It is uncertain whether clinical efficacy can be improved by avoiding the inflammatory phase when hydrogels are delivered during adhesion formation.

Questions/purposes

(1) Compared with intraoperative hydrogel application, does ultrasound-guided postoperative application result in better total active motion (TAM) at 12 months after tendon injury? (2) Does ultrasound-guided postoperative application of hydrogels result in lower pain, better function, and better satisfaction?

Methods

This open-label, prospective, single-center, randomized controlled trial was conducted by reparative and reconstructive surgeons at the National Orthopedics Clinical Medical Center, Shanghai, People's Republic of China. Between May 2021 and December 2022, 53% (168 of 317) of patients who met our inclusion criteria were recruited, and 47% (149 of 317) of patients were excluded because of the exclusion criteria. Finally, 84 patients were randomized to the postoperative group to receive ultrasound-guided carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) hydrogel delayed injection, and 84 patients were randomized to the intraoperative group to receive CMC hydrogel intraoperative application. Another 8% (7 of 84) of patients in the postoperative group and 10% (8 of 84) of patients in the intraoperative group were lost before the minimum study follow-up time of 1 year or had incomplete datasets, leaving 91% (153 of 168) of patients with data for analysis. Data on outcome events were analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle, which included all patients who underwent randomization. Follow-up visits were completed at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after tendon repair. The primary outcome was TAM (ie, the sum of the degrees of active metacarpophalangeal joint, proximal interphalangeal joint, and distal interphalangeal joint flexion less the degrees from full extension; minimum clinically important difference [MCID] 20°) at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included pain (measured with a VAS; range 0 to 10, a higher score indicating worse pain; MCID 0.6), Michigan Hand Outcomes Questionnaire activities of daily living (MHQ-ADL) score (range 0 to 100, a higher score indicating better outcomes; MCID 10.1), and MHQ satisfaction (MHQ-SAT) score (range 0 to 100, a higher score indicating better outcomes; MCID 33.0).

Results

At 12 months, the ultrasound-guided postoperative injection group had improved TAM (intraoperative 189° [95% CI 179° to 199°] versus postoperative 209° [95% CI 199° to 219°], mean difference 20° [95% CI 6° to 35°]; p = 0.006; the mean difference in the primary outcome fulfilled the MCID value at all time points). At 6 weeks, we found no clinically important difference in VAS pain scores among groups (intraoperative mean ± SD 2.0 ± 1.0 versus postoperative 1.7 ± 1.0, mean difference 0.3 [95% CI 0.1 to 0.7]; p = 0.02); however, at 3 weeks, the VAS pain scores showed clinically important difference among groups (3.6 ± 1.4 versus 2.9 ± 1.2, mean difference 0.7 [95% CI 0.3 to 1.1]; p = 0.001). At 3 months, the ultrasound-guided postoperative injection group had higher MHQ-ADL scores (intraoperative 62 ± 10 versus postoperative 75 ± 10, mean difference 13 [95% CI 11 to 17]; p < 0.001), and the mean difference of MHQ-ADL scores reached the MCID value at all time points. At 3 months, there was no clinically important difference in MHQ-SAT scores between groups (intraoperative 62 ± 8 versus postoperative 70 ± 8, mean difference 8 [95% CI 6 to 11]; p < 0.001).

Conclusion

Compared with intraoperative CMC hydrogel injection, postoperative ultrasound-guided injection improved the TAM and function of the affected limb, showed a short-term pain control effect, and did not increase the risk of complications. Clinical trials are needed to confirm the safety and efficacy of ultrasound-guided postoperative injection of CMC hydrogels and to determine the most effective dose and the health and economic benefits of treatment.
