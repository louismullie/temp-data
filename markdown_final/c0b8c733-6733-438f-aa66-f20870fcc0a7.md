## Question

Is fluconazole 300 mg indicated for fungal rash under breast?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether fluconazole 300 mg is indicated for a fungal rash under the breast, and if so, how to dose it appropriately. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the likely diagnosis and whether this is candidal intertrigo versus dermatophyte or something else. Then, I should verify what the FDA label and major guidelines say about fluconazole indications and dosing for superficial cutaneous candidiasis. Next, I will check whether 300 mg is a standard dose or if 100–200 mg is the evidence-based range. After that, I need to consider safety, duration, and when to escalate to oral therapy. Finally, I will outline a practical, stepwise plan and confirm any exceptions, like immunocompromise or failure of topical therapy.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity. A "fungal rash under the breast" in a moist, occluded inframammary fold most commonly represents candidal intertrigo, often Candida albicans, characterized by erythematous, macerated plaques with possible satellite pustules; however, I should keep dermatophyte (tinea) and even nonfungal mimics in mind, so I need to ensure the diagnosis is supported clinically or with KOH/culture if atypical or refractory [^117WHEPy].

> Next, I should review guideline-based therapy. Wait, let me verify the first-line approach: topical antifungals are recommended for candidal intertrigo, applied twice daily until resolution, with adjunctive measures to reduce moisture and friction; this is the standard starting point before considering systemic therapy [^116YPGwx].

> I will now examine when oral fluconazole is appropriate. Hold on, I should verify the dose. The AAFP guideline recommends oral fluconazole 100–200 mg daily for 7 days for intertrigo with a resistant fungal infection or when topical therapy fails, with consideration of a higher dose in obesity; notably, 300 mg is not a standard regimen in this context, and I should be cautious not to over-dose for a superficial infection [^115SeyV4].

> Let me consider the 300 mg dose that was proposed. Hmm, wait a minute — 300 mg appears in a different superficial indication: tinea versicolor, where fluconazole 300 mg once weekly for 2 weeks has supportive data; that regimen does not translate to candidal intertrigo, so using 300 mg daily for intertrigo would be off-label and higher than evidence-based recommendations for cutaneous candidiasis [^1135sAuz] [^115SeyV4].

> I should confirm safety and monitoring. Fluconazole is generally well tolerated, but I need to check for hepatotoxicity risk, drug interactions, and pregnancy considerations; for short courses of 7–14 days, routine liver test monitoring is not mandatory, but I should monitor if treatment extends beyond about 3 weeks, if there is hepatic disease, or if interacting drugs are present, and I must avoid high-dose fluconazole in the first trimester of pregnancy due to teratogenic risk, favoring topical therapy instead [^115zaGpq] [^117QihLd] [^111gpTB6].

> But wait, what if the rash is not candida? If the morphology or KOH suggests dermatophyte rather than Candida, I should reconsider the agent; oral terbinafine is often preferred for extensive tinea of large body areas, whereas fluconazole has variable activity against dermatophytes and is not first-line for tinea corporis in most cases, so I need to ensure the etiology matches the treatment before committing to fluconazole [^111Hhq3g].

> I should double-check red flags that would change management. In immunocompromised hosts or when there is necrosis, ulceration, or failure of appropriate therapy, I must consider non-Candida molds such as mucormycosis in skin folds; these require urgent biopsy, surgical debridement, and amphotericin B rather than fluconazole, so persistent or atypical lesions warrant escalation and tissue diagnosis rather than simply increasing the fluconazole dose [^112HS299] [^116gxNjq].

> Let me synthesize a practical plan. First-line remains topical therapy with a topical azole or nystatin plus moisture control; if there is no improvement in 1–2 weeks or disease is extensive/recurrent, a short oral fluconazole course of 100–200 mg daily for 7 days is reasonable, with consideration of the higher end of that range in obesity; 300 mg daily is not standard here, and I should avoid it unless there is a compelling, individualized rationale and close monitoring, which would be off-label [^116YPGwx] [^115SeyV4].

> Final answer: No, fluconazole 300 mg is not the standard indicated dose for a fungal rash under the breast; evidence-based dosing for candidal intertrigo is fluconazole 100–200 mg orally once daily for 7 days when oral therapy is warranted, with topical antifungals as first-line and escalation only for resistance or intolerance, while monitoring for safety and confirming the diagnosis if the course is atypical or refractory [^115SeyV4] [^116YPGwx].

---

Fluconazole 300 mg is **not the standard dose** for fungal rash under the breast (intertrigo). The recommended regimen is **100–200 mg orally once daily for 7 days** [^115SeyV4], with topical antifungals as first-line therapy [^116YPGwx]. Use 300 mg only if there is severe disease, obesity, or refractory infection, and monitor for hepatotoxicity and drug interactions [^115zaGpq] [^111gpTB6].

---

## Clinical indications for fluconazole in intertrigo

Intertrigo is a superficial fungal infection, most often due to Candida species, and is managed primarily with topical antifungals [^116YPGwx]; **systemic therapy is reserved for refractory or extensive disease**. The AAFP recommends topical antifungals as first-line therapy [^116YPGwx] and oral fluconazole 100–200 mg daily for 7 days for resistant or extensive infections [^115SeyV4].

---

## Recommended fluconazole dosing for intertrigo

The **standard oral fluconazole regimen** for intertrigo is 100–200 mg once daily for 7 days [^115SeyV4]. This dose balances efficacy and safety for superficial infections. Higher doses (e.g. 300 mg) are not routinely recommended but may be considered in severe cases, obesity, or refractory infections, with careful monitoring for adverse effects.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting fluconazole use in intertrigo

Evidence supports topical antifungals as first-line therapy for intertrigo [^116YPGwx]; **oral fluconazole is reserved for refractory cases** [^115SeyV4]. No robust evidence specifically supports 300 mg for intertrigo, and the 100–200 mg regimen is standard practice.

---

## Safety considerations and potential side effects

Fluconazole is generally well tolerated, but clinicians should be aware of the following:

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Rare but serious; monitor liver function in prolonged therapy or with hepatic disease [^115zaGpq] [^111gpTB6].
- **Drug interactions**: CYP3A4 interactions (e.g. warfarin, certain statins) can increase toxicity risk [^notfound].
- **Common side effects**: Nausea, headache, abdominal pain, and rash [^115hqCRB].

---

## Comparison with alternative antifungal treatments

Topical antifungals (clotrimazole, miconazole, ketoconazole) are **first-line** for intertrigo [^116YPGwx] due to efficacy and minimal systemic absorption. Oral itraconazole or terbinafine are alternatives for refractory or resistant cases, but fluconazole is preferred for Candida due to its safety and convenience.

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines emphasize topical therapy as first-line for intertrigo, with oral fluconazole 100–200 mg daily for 7 days for refractory or extensive disease [^115SeyV4]. Routine use of 300 mg is **not recommended** due to limited evidence and higher adverse-effect risk.

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing fluconazole dosing

Patient-specific factors may influence dosing:

- **Obesity**: May require higher doses (e.g. 200–300 mg) to achieve therapeutic levels.
- **Immunocompromised status**: May necessitate higher doses or longer duration.
- **Renal impairment**: Dose adjustment may be required due to renal elimination [^112xUMv3].

---

## Clinical outcomes and recurrence rates

Fluconazole is effective for intertrigo, with **rapid symptom improvement** and low recurrence when combined with hygiene measures. Recurrence is common without ongoing moisture control and hygiene.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Fluconazole 300 mg is **not the standard dose** for fungal rash under the breast; the recommended regimen is 100–200 mg orally once daily for 7 days [^115SeyV4]. Reserve 300 mg for severe, refractory, or obesity-related cases, with close monitoring for adverse effects and drug interactions.

Case 2

A 67-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer and interstitial lung disease was hospitalized for hypoxic respiratory failure, for which she had received a bilateral lung transplant but remained with persistent respiratory failure. Her antifungal prophylaxis consisted of oral voriconazole. The patient had been hospitalized for 5 months when she developed a rash under her left breast, which failed to improve with topical nystatin and intravenous antibiotic treatment for one week (Fig 1, B). Skin biopsy and fungal culture confirmed mucormycosis infection and the patient was treated with 5 mg/kg daily intravenous amphotericin B for a total of 5.2 g over 13 days and posaconazole and surgical debridement. The patient tolerated amphotericin B therapy with no major signs of nephrotoxicity or hepatotoxicity. She expired within 2 weeks due to refractory mucormycosis infection.

Case 3

A 72-year-old woman with a history of acute myelogenous leukemia status post chemotherapy with cytarabine and lenalidomide was hospitalized for allogenic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. Her hospitalization was complicated by cytokine storm and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus bacteremia. Her antifungal prophylaxis consisted of oral micafungin and fluconazole. The patient had been hospitalized for 3 weeks prior to developing a painful, purple lesion in her groin which failed to improve with skin fold drying and application of a commercial moisture-wicking antimicrobial fabric for 3 days (Fig 1, C). A skin biopsy of the groin and fungal culture confirmed mucormycosis infection. She was initiated on 5 mg/kg of daily intravenous amphotericin B and shortly expired 4 days later due to mucormycosis infection and sepsis from vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus.

Question 3: Which of the following is the next best step in the management of this patient?
A. Topical ketoconazole 2% cream twice daily for 4 weeks
B. Oral terbinafine 250 mg daily for 4 weeks
C. Oral ketoconazole 200 mg daily for 4 weeks
D. Topical clobetasol 0.05% ointment twice daily for 2 weeks
E. Oral prednisone 60 mg daily for 3 weeks

Answers:

A. Topical ketoconazole 2% cream twice daily for 4 weeks — Incorrect. A topical antifungal agent alone would not be appropriate, given the extensive areas of involvement and previous extended treatment with topical corticosteroids.
B. Oral terbinafine 250 mg daily for 4 weeks — Correct. Oral terbinafine is one of the most effective treatments for tinea imbricata and tinea pseudoimbricata. Oral antifungal therapy can be combined with topical antifungals for an enhanced cure rate.
C. Oral ketoconazole 200 mg daily for 4 weeks — Incorrect. Although oral ketoconazole may be effective in the treatment of dermatophytosis, the Food and Drug Administration has applied a black-box warning because of the risk of serious hepatotoxicity potentially requiring liver transplant. The oral form of this medication is not indicated to treat skin or nail infections. It is contraindicated in patients with acute or chronic liver failure.
D. Topical clobetasol 0.05% ointment twice daily for 2 weeks — Incorrect. Although topical corticosteroids may be helpful in cases of erythema gyratum repens, their use in tinea imbricata or tinea pseudoimbricata would be expected to worsen the disease.
E. Oral prednisone 60 mg daily for 3 weeks — Incorrect. Oral corticosteroids may be helpful in cases of erythema gyratum repens but would not be indicated for the treatment of tinea imbricata or tinea pseudoimbricata. Systemic immunosuppression could potentially worsen the progression of a dermatophyte infection.

Guideline recommendations from the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis are summarized in Table 1. Topical therapy (e.g. clotrimazole troches or nystatin suspensions or pastilles) is recommended as first-line treatment for patients with an initial episode of mild disease (strength of recommendation: B). The recommended initial treatment for moderate-to-severe disease is oral fluconazole 100–200 mg (3 mg/kg) once-daily for 7–14 days (strength of recommendation: A). For esophageal candidiasis, systemic antifungal therapy is always required, and oral fluconazole 200–400 mg (3–6 mg/kg) daily for 14–21 days is recommended (strength of recommendation: A).

Cutaneous Candidiasis

Cutaneous candidiasis usually affects intertriginous areas, such as the groin, abdominal skin folds, and inframammary skin, but can also occur in interdigital spaces. Typically, cutaneous candidiasis presents as thin, bright-red plaques that can be erosive, dry, scaly, oozing, or macerated (Fig. 1 b); pustules and collarette scales may also be present. Diagnosis of cutaneous candidiasis is usually based on clinical appearance of the skin, the presence of pseudohyphae in KOH wet mounts, or positive fungal culture of scrapings from affected areas.

IDSA guidelines recommend topical triazoles and polyenes (e.g. clotrimazole, miconazole, and nystatin) for the treatment of cutaneous candidiasis. Affected areas should be kept dry and, if necessary, Burrow's solution compresses can be used as a drying agent.

Case series

Case 1

A 63-year-old woman with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma was hospitalized for treatment with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy. Her hospital course was complicated by cytokine release syndrome, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome, and pancytopenia requiring allogeneic stem cell transplantation. Her antifungal prophylaxis consisted of intravenous micafungin followed by oral posaconazole. The patient had been hospitalized for approximately 3 months prior to developing a painful and pruritic rash under her left breast (Fig 1, A). The rash was initially believed to be intertrigo and failed to improve with topical ketoconazole treatment for 5 days at which time dermatology was consulted. Skin biopsy, histologic examination with Periodic acid-Schiff stain, and fungal culture confirmed mucormycosis infection. The patient was subsequently treated with 5 mg/kg of intravenous amphotericin B, dosed at 250 mg daily for a total dosage of 6.25 g over 25 days and surgical debridement. The patient tolerated amphotericin B treatment maintaining stable kidney function within normal reference range including serum creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, electrolyte levels, and liver function tests. She expired within 1 month due to refractory mucormycosis infection and concomitant Mycoplasma pneumonia.

### Fluconazole [^111dWMfC]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Nursing Mothers

Fluconazole was present in low levels in breast milk following administration of a single 150 mg dose, based on data from a study in 10 breastfeeding women who temporarily or permanently discontinued breastfeeding 5 days to 19 months postpartum. The estimated daily infant dose of fluconazole from breast milk (assuming mean milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day) based on the mean peak milk concentration (2.61 mcg/mL [range: 1.57 to 3.65 mcg/mL] at 5.2 hours post-dose) was 0.39 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 13% of the recommended pediatric dose for oropharyngeal candidiasis. (Labeled pediatric dose is 6 mg/kg/day on the first day followed by 3 mg/kg/day; estimated infant dose is 13% of 3 mg/kg/day maintenance dose). There are no data on fluconazole levels in milk after repeated use or after high-dose fluconazole. A published survey of 96 breastfeeding women who were treated with fluconazole 150 mg every other day (average of 7.3 capsules [range 1 to 29 capsules]) for lactation-associated candida of the breasts reported no serious adverse reactions in infants. Caution should be exercised when fluconazole is administered to a nursing woman.

WARNINGS

(1) Hepatic injury: Fluconazole should be administered with caution to patients with liver dysfunction. Fluconazole has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatic toxicity, including fatalities primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions. In cases of fluconazole-associated hepatotoxicity, no obvious relationship to total daily dose, duration of therapy, sex, or age of the patient has been observed. Fluconazole hepatotoxicity has usually, but not always, been reversible on discontinuation of therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during fluconazole therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Fluconazole should be discontinued if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to fluconazole.

(2) Anaphylaxis: In rare cases, anaphylaxis has been reported.

(3) Dermatologic: Exfoliative skin disorders during treatment with fluconazole have been reported. Fatal outcomes have been reported in patients with serious underlying diseases. Patients with deep seated fungal infections who develop rashes during treatment with fluconazole should be monitored closely and the drug discontinued if lesions progress. Fluconazole should be discontinued in patients treated for superficial fungal infection who develop a rash that may be attributed to fluconazole.

(4) Potential for fetal harm: There are no adequate and well-controlled clinical trials of fluconazole in pregnant women. Case reports describe a pattern of distinct congenital anomalies in infants exposed in utero to high dose maternal fluconazole (400 to 800 mg/day) during most or all of the first trimester. These reported anomalies are similar to those seen in animal studies. If fluconazole is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking the drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus. Effective contraceptive measures should be considered in women of child-bearing potential who are being treated with fluconazole 400 to 800 mg/day and should continue throughout the treatment period and for approximately 1 week (5 to 6 half-lives) after the final dose. Epidemiological studies suggest a potential risk of spontaneous abortion and congenital abnormalities in infants whose mothers were treated with 150 mg of fluconazole as a single or repeated dose in the first trimester, but these epidemiological studies have limitations and these findings have not been confirmed in controlled clinical trials. (See PRECAUTIONS: Pregnancy .)

Candidemia treatment comparative evidence: Despite randomized controlled trials of therapy for candidemia and other invasive candidiasis, no single trial has demonstrated clear superiority of one therapeutic agent over another; for instance, amphotericin B (AmB) plus fluconazole is at least as effective as higher-dose (800 mg daily) fluconazole given alone for patients with candidemia, but there is little role for this combination in current practice. While awaiting culture and susceptibility data, a working knowledge of the local epidemiology and rates of antifungal resistance is critical for informed therapeutic decisions.

Empiric therapy for suspected invasive candidiasis — echinocandins, fluconazole, and amphotericin B options with duration and stopping criteria: An echinocandin is an option with caspofungin loading dose of 70 mg then 50 mg daily, micafungin 100 mg daily, or anidulafungin loading dose of 200 mg then 100 mg daily (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Fluconazole, 800 mg (12 mg/kg) loading dose then 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily, is an acceptable alternative for patients without recent azole exposure and without colonization by azole-resistant Candida species (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Lipid formulation AmB, 3–5 mg/kg daily, is an alternative when there is intolerance to other antifungal agents (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). The recommended duration of empiric therapy in patients who improve is 2 weeks, the same as for documented candidemia (weak recommendation; low-quality evidence). For patients with no clinical response at 4–5 days and no subsequent evidence of invasive candidiasis after starting empiric therapy, consideration should be given to stopping antifungal therapy (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).

Nursing Mothers

Fluconazole was present in low levels in breast milk following administration of a single 150 mg dose, based on data from a study in 10 breastfeeding women who temporarily or permanently discontinued breastfeeding 5 days to 19 months postpartum. The estimated daily infant dose of fluconazole from breast milk (assuming mean milk consumption of 150 mL/kg/day) based on the mean peak milk concentration (2.61 mcg/mL [range: 1.57 to 3.65 mcg/mL] at 5.2 hours post-dose) was 0.39 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 13% of the recommended pediatric dose for oropharyngeal candidiasis. (Labeled pediatric dose is 6 mg/kg/day on the first day followed by 3 mg/kg/day; estimated infant dose is 13% of 3 mg/kg/day maintenance dose). There are no data on fluconazole levels in milk after repeated use or after high-dose fluconazole. A published survey of 96 breastfeeding women who were treated with fluconazole 150 mg every other day (average of 7.3 capsules [range 1 to 29 capsules]) for lactation-associated candida of the breasts reported no serious adverse reactions in infants. Caution should be exercised when DIFLUCAN is administered to a nursing woman.

### Fluconazole, sodium chloride (fluconazole in sodium chloride) [^1113ZQdJ]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

(1) Hepatic injury: Fluconazole should be administered with caution to patients with liver dysfunction. Fluconazole has been associated with rare cases of serious hepatic toxicity, including fatalities primarily in patients with serious underlying medical conditions. In cases of fluconazole-associated hepatotoxicity, no obvious relationship to total daily dose, duration of therapy, sex, or age of the patient has been observed. Fluconazole hepatotoxicity has usually, but not always, been reversible on discontinuation of therapy. Patients who develop abnormal liver function tests during Fluconazole in Sodium Chloride Injection, USP therapy should be monitored for the development of more severe hepatic injury. Fluconazole in Sodium Chloride Injection, USP should be discontinued if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop that may be attributable to fluconazole.

(2) Anaphylaxis: In rare cases, anaphylaxis has been reported.

(3) Dermatologic: Exfoliative skin disorders during treatment with fluconazole have been reported. Fatal outcomes have been reported in patients with serious underlying diseases. Patients with deep seated fungal infections who develop rashes during treatment with Fluconazole in Sodium Chloride Injection, USP should be monitored closely and the drug discontinued if lesions progress. Fluconazole should be discontinued in patients treated for superficial fungal infection who develop a rash that may be attributed to fluconazole.

(4) Use in Pregnancy: There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of fluconazole in pregnant women. Available human data do not suggest an increased risk of congenital anomalies following a single maternal dose of 150 mg. A few published case reports describe a rare pattern of distinct congenital anomalies in infants exposed in utero to high dose maternal fluconazole (400–800 mg/day) during most or all of the first trimester. These reported anomalies are similar to those seen in animal studies. If this drug is used during pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking the drug, the patient should be informed of the potential hazard to the fetus (See PRECAUTIONS, Pregnancy .)

Fluconazole — adult dosing and renal adjustment: For candidiasis in adults, it should be administered with an average loading dose of 800 mg (12 mg/kg), followed by an average daily dose of 400 mg (6 mg/ kg). The higher-dose level (800 mg daily, 12 mg/kg) is often recommended for therapy of susceptible C. glabrata infections, but this has not been validated in clinical trials. Fluconazole elimination is almost entirely renal; thus, a dose reduction is needed in patients with creatinine clearance < 50 mL/minute.

### Management of adverse events in patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer treated with everolimus: observations from a phase III clinical trial [^112zXQuH]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Infection

Infection is a common AE reported in patients treated with everolimus (Table 1). The innate immunosuppressive properties of everolimus may predispose patients to bacterial, fungal, viral, or protozoal infections including pneumonia, sepsis, mycobacterial infections, aspergillosis, candidiasis, and reactivation of the hepatitis B virus. In the phase III RECORD-1 trial of everolimus (10 mg/day) in advanced RCC, everolimus-related severe infection was reported, including infection associated with fatal respiratory failure or sepsis. In BOLERO-2, sepsis caused two deaths. Therefore, professionals should be vigilant in evaluating for signs and symptoms of infection with immediate appropriate treatment taken.

Management recommendations

In order to identify patients at greater risk for developing infection, a full medical history of prior infection should be obtained and laboratory tests conducted before commencing everolimus therapy including fungal, hepatitis, HIV, tuberculosis, and any other opportunistic infections or pulmonary conditions. Based on results from RECORD-1, a clinical management strategy has been outlined by an advisory panel for the treatment of grade 1 to 4 infection (Table 4). Patients with evidence of fungal infection should be comprehensively treated before everolimus initiation. If an invasive systemic fungal infection is suspected during treatment, everolimus should be immediately withdrawn and the patient treated with an appropriate antifungal. For patients with hepatitis B virus infection, hepatitis B virus DNA should be monitored and antiviral prophylactic treatment given to prevent reactivation. Current guidelines recommend the use of high-potency and high-genetic barrier agents to quickly suppress viremia while reducing progression of hepatic damage and the potential for developing resistant mutants.

a If diagnosis of invasive systemic fungal infection is made, everolimus therapy should be promptly and permanently discontinued. Avoid coadministration of everolimus with strong cytochrome 3A4 inhibitors

Question 3: What is the most appropriate treatment for PCM in these patients?
A. Amphotericin B
B. Surgical procedures
C. Fluconazole
D. Itraconazole
E. Ketoconazole

Answers:

A. Amphotericin B – Incorrect. Amphotericin B (deoxycholate or in lipid formulations) is effective in the treatment of PCM. However, it is indicated for severe and disseminated forms of PCM.
B. Surgical procedures – Incorrect. Considering that PCM is a multifocal disease and mucocutaneous lesions are secondary to hematogenous dissemination from the lung, surgical treatment is not effective for reducing morbidity, mortality, or sequelae.
C. Fluconazole – Incorrect. Despite its in-vitro activity against Paracoccidioides spp. there is a lack of clinical experience with regard to its use for PCM treatment. Fluconazole is used in some cases, such as patients with liver disease or in combination with sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim in neurological PCM.
D. Itraconazole – Correct. Itraconazole at a dose of 200 mg daily for 9 to 18 months is the first-line treatment for mild and moderate forms of PCM due to its efficacy and safety. Sulfamethoxazole/ trimethoprimat a dose of 800/160 mg twice or three times a day for 18 to 24 months is the second-line treatment. Nevertheless, it is often the first choice due to its large availability in Brazil.
E. Ketoconazole – Incorrect. Ketoconazole is effective in the treatment of PCM. However, the Food and Drug Administration warns that it should not be used as a first-line treatment for any fungal infection because there are safer options, and it can cause severe liver injury.

Mucocutaneous candidiasis — monitoring of response and adverse events: For most patients with mucocutaneous candidiasis, response to antifungal therapy is rapid; signs and symptoms improve within 48 to 72 hours. Short courses of topical therapy rarely result in adverse effects, although patients may experience cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions characterized by rash and pruritus. Oral azole therapy can be associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or transaminase elevations. Periodic monitoring of liver function studies should be considered if azole therapy is anticipated for > 21 days, especially in patients with other hepatic comorbidities (AII). The echinocandins appear to be associated with very few adverse reactions: histamine-related infusion toxicity, transaminase elevations, and rash have been attributed to these drugs, and no dose adjustments are required in renal failure.

Coccidioidomycosis — posaconazole and voriconazole in nonresponders, with dosing, monitoring, and safety: Data to support clinical efficacy for treatment with posaconazole, voriconazole, or isavuconazole are limited, but these agents are recommended for patients who do not respond to fluconazole or itraconazole (BIII). Voriconazole is given as a loading dose of 400 mg twice on Day 1, followed thereafter by 200 mg twice daily, and trough serum voriconazole concentrations should be measured to ensure efficacy and avoid toxicity; a concentration of 1 to 5 μg/mL is desired. For posaconazole, a dose of 400 mg twice daily of the older liquid formulation has been used, but the delayed-release tablet at 300 mg twice on the first day and then 300 mg once daily is therefore recommended (BIII); a syndrome of mineralocorticoid excess with hypokalemia has been reported, and monitoring of blood pressure and serum potassium levels is appropriate in patients taking posaconazole.

### Anidulafungin: a new echinocandin with a novel profile [^112YfYTC]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Until recently, available treatment for serious fungal infections comprised amphotericin B and azoles, which have limitations. Renal toxicity is a major concern with amphotericin B, while drug-drug interactions, hepatotoxicity, and skin rashes are the primary concerns with the azole medications. The development of the echinocandins, including caspofungin, has helped to fill the need for more efficacious antifungals that are useful across different patient populations and have a good safety profile. Anidulafungin is an echinocandin being developed to treat mucosal and invasive fungal infections.

Objective

The aim of this report was to describe the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of anidulafungin.

Methods

Data were identified using MEDLINE and National Library of Medicine Gateway searches for English-language literature (key words: anidulafungin, esophageal candidiasis, echinocandin, caspofungin, ravuconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, micafungin, and fluconazole; years: 1996–2004), and from meeting abstracts of the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (Arlington Heights, Illinois), European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (Basel, Switzerland), International Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (Washington, DC), and Infectious Diseases Society of America (Arlington, Virginia).

Results

Anidulafungin has potent in vitro activity against Aspergillus and Candida spp, including those resistant to either fluconazole or amphotericin B. Results of several clinical trials imply that anidulafungin is effective in treating esophageal candidiasis (EC), candidemia, and invasive candidiasis (IC). In a Phase III, randomized, blinded clinical trial evaluating anidulafungin (50 mg/d) versus fluconazole (100 mg/d) for the treatment of EC, 97.2% and 98.9% of patients who received anidulafungin and fluconazole, respectively, showed evidence of cure or improvement (treatment difference, -1.6%; 95% CI, -4.1 to 0.8). In a Phase II study of candidasis and candidemia, anidulafungin showed success rates of 72%, 85%, and 83% in patients receiving the drug at dosages of 50, 75, or 100 mg/d, respectively. Studies evaluating the concomitant use of anidulafungin and either amphotericin, voriconazole, or cyclosporine did not show clinically significant drug-drug interactions or altered adverse-event (AE) profiles (P < 0.05). A population PK analysis showed no significant effect of age, race, concomitant medications, or renal or hepatic insufficiency on the PK properties of anidulafungin (P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Anidulafungin may offer a new option to treat serious fungal infections, such as EC, azole-refractory EC, candidemia, and IC. In addition, anidulafungin has been associated with no clinically significant drug-drug interactions and few treatment-related AEs. Anidulafungin may offer a new option in the management of serious and difficult-to-treat invasive fungal infections.

### Oral fluconazole in the treatment of tinea versicolor [^1135sAuz]. The Journal of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

This study was designed to assess the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of oral fluconazole given at 300 mg once weekly for two weeks in the treatment of tinea versicolor. Enrolled into the study were 44 subjects with tinea versicolor, provisionally confirmed by the detection of fungal hyphae in KOH wet mounts and Wood's lamp examination. Four subjects were classified as dropouts because no information was obtained from them after the baseline visit. Subjects were treated for two weeks orally with fluconazole 300 mg weekly and followed at the 1st, 2nd, 4th and 12th weeks of treatment. The study included 40 subjects (26 males and 14 females, mean age 29 years, range 19–48 years). At the week 4 visit, 30 (75%) patients showed a complete cure and 31 (77.5%) patients showed mycologic cure. Ten (25%) patients had no significant response to therapy. At the final follow-up visit (week 12), none of the patients showing complete or mycologic cures exhibited a recurrence. No adverse effects were observed in any of the patients treated. We believe that, due to the low incidence of side effects, shorter treatment duration, and increased adaptation of the patients, fluconazole can be used in the treatment of tinea versicolor with confidence.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The data described below reflect exposure to VANDAZOLE compared to another formulation of vaginal metronidazole in 220 women in a single trial. The population was non-pregnant females (age range 18 to 72 years, the mean was 33 years ± 11 years) with bacterial vaginosis. The racial demographic of those enrolled was 71 (32%) of White, 143 (65%) of Black, 3 (1%) of Hispanic, 2 (1%) of Asian, and 1 (0%) of other. Patients administered an applicator full of VANDAZOLE intravaginally once daily at bedtime for 5 days.

There were no deaths or serious adverse reactions related to drug therapy in the clinical trial. VANDAZOLE was discontinued in 5 patients (2.3%) due to adverse reactions.

The incidence of all adverse reactions in VANDAZOLE-treated patients was 42% (92/220). Adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 1% of patients were: fungal infection* (12%), headache (7%), pruritus (6%), abdominal pain (5%), nausea (3%), dysmenorrhea (3%), pharyngitis (2%), rash (1%), infection (1%), diarrhea (1%), breast pain (1%), and metrorrhagia (1%).

* Known or previously unrecognized vaginal candidiasis may present more prominent symptoms during therapy with VANDAZOLE. Approximately 10% of patients treated with VANDAZOLE developed Candida vaginitis during or immediately after therapy.

Additional uncommon events, reported by < 1% of those women treated with VANDAZOLE included:

Antifungals — azoles are outlined with scope and mechanism: Antifungal medications including the azoles have long been used for treatment and prophylaxis of fungal infections, while newer agents such as echinocandins are increasingly used in pediatric and adult infections. The azole class comprises triazoles (fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole, and isavuconazole) and imidazoles (clotrimazole, ketoconazole, and miconazole), and these drugs disrupt the fungal cell membrane through impairment of ergosterol synthesis. Each azole has distinctive indications ranging from mucosal candidiasis to invasive mycoses.

Background

Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is one of the most common fungal infections that recur frequently in HIV infected women. Symptoms of VVC are pruritis, discomfort, dyspareunia, and dysuria. Vulval infection presents as a morbiliform rash that may extend to the thighs. Vaginal infection is associated with white discharge, and plaques are seen on erythematous vaginal walls. Even though rarely or never resulting in systemic fungal infection or mortality, left untreated these lesions contribute considerably to the morbidity associated with HIV infection. Prevention and treatment of this condition is an essential part of maintaining the quality of life for these individuals.

Objectives

-To compare the efficacy of various antifungals given vaginally or orally for the treatment and prophylaxis of VVC in HIV-infected women and to evaluate the risks of the same.

Search Strategy

The search strategy was comprehensive, iterative and based on that of the HIV/AIDS Cochrane Review Group. The aim was to locate all relevant trials, irrespective of publication status or language. Electronic databases :CENTRAL, Medline, EMBASE, LILACS and CINAHL were searched for randomised controlled trials for the years 1980 to 1st October 2010. WHO ICTRP site and other relevant web sites were also searched for conference abstracts.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of palliative, preventative or curative therapy were considered. Participants were HIV positive women receiving one or more of the following:treatment / prophylaxis for VVC or HAART(Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy).

Data Collection and Analysis

Three authors independently assessed the methodological quality of the trials and extracted data. The quality of the evidence generated was graded using the GRADE PRO approach.

Main Results

Our search did not yield any trial investigating treatment of VVC in HIV positive women. Two trials dealing with prophylaxis were eligible for inclusion. One trial (n = 323) favoured the use of weekly Fluconazole as compared to placebo (RR 0.68; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.97). The second trial with three arms of comparison; Clotrimazole, Lactobacillus and Placebo gave no definitive results in preventing an episode of VVC. Clotrimazole against placebo (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.22 to 1.09), Clotrimazole against lactobacillus (RR 1.11; 95% CI 0.45 to 2.76) and lactobacillus against placebo (RR 0.54 ;95% CI 0.26 to 1.13).

Authors' Conclusions

Implications for practiceNo trials were found addressing treatment of VVC in HIV positive women. In comparison to placebo, Fluconazole was found to be an effective preventative intervention. However, the potential for resistant Candida organisms to develop might impact the feasibility of implementation. Direction of findings suggests that Clotrimazole and Lactobacillus improved the prophylactic outcomes when compared to placebo. Implications for research There is a need to evaluate drugs and drug regimens for VVC treatment and prophylaxis in HIV positive women through randomised clinical trials. Development of resistance to azoles remains under-studied and more work must be done in this area, so as to determine whether routine prophylaxis for VVC is at all needed or whether adequate ART would be sufficient to prevent recurrent VVC. The viral load in vaginal secretions with or without treatment or prophylaxis has not been studied, this is very relevant to the spread of HIV.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111dF8bZ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2016 — candidemia in nonneutropenic patients susceptibility testing and step-down — Testing for azole susceptibility is recommended for all bloodstream and other clinically relevant Candida isolates. Testing for echinocandin susceptibility should be considered in patients who have had prior treatment with an echinocandin and among those who have infection with C. glabrata or C. parapsilosis (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Transition from an echinocandin to fluconazole (usually within 5–7 days) is recommended for patients who are clinically stable, have isolates that are susceptible to fluconazole (eg, C. albicans), and have negative repeat blood cultures following initiation of antifungal therapy (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). For infection due to C. glabrata, transition to higher-dose fluconazole 800 mg (12 mg/kg) daily or voriconazole 200–300 (3–4 mg/kg) twice daily should only be considered among patients with fluconazole-susceptible or voriconazole-susceptible isolates (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Transition from AmB to fluconazole is recommended after 5–7 days among patients who have isolates that are susceptible to fluconazole, who are clinically stable, and in whom repeat cultures on antifungal therapy are negative (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence).

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Fluconazole is generally well tolerated.

In some patients, particularly those with serious underlying diseases such as AIDS and cancer, changes in renal and hematological function test results and hepatic abnormalities have been observed during treatment with fluconazole and comparative agents, but the clinical significance and relationship to treatment is uncertain.

In Patients Receiving a Single Dose for Vaginal Candidiasis:

During comparative clinical studies conducted in the United States, 448 patients with vaginal candidiasis were treated with fluconazole, 150 mg single dose. The overall incidence of side effects possibly related to fluconazole was 26%. In 422 patients receiving active comparative agents, the incidence was 16%. The most common treatment-related adverse events reported in the patients who received 150 mg single dose fluconazole for vaginitis were headache (13%), nausea (7%), and abdominal pain (6%). Other side effects reported with an incidence equal to or greater than 1% included diarrhea (3%), dyspepsia (1%), dizziness (1%), and taste perversion (1%). Most of the reported side effects were mild to moderate in severity. Rarely, angioedema and anaphylactic reaction have been reported in marketing experience.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of candidiasis: 2016 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^1115XoNG]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

IDSA 2016 — candidemia in nonneutropenic patients initial therapy and alternatives — An echinocandin (caspofungin: loading dose 70 mg, then 50 mg daily; micafungin: 100 mg daily; anidulafungin: loading dose 200 mg, then 100 mg daily) is recommended as initial therapy (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). Fluconazole, intravenous or oral, 800-mg (12 mg/kg) loading dose, then 400 mg (6 mg/kg) daily is an acceptable alternative to an echinocandin as initial therapy in selected patients, including those who are not critically ill and who are considered unlikely to have a fluconazole-resistant Candida species (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence). Lipid formulation AmB (3–5 mg/kg daily) is a reasonable alternative if there is intolerance, limited availability, or resistance to other antifungal agents (strong recommendation; high-quality evidence), and among patients with suspected azole- and echinocandin-resistant Candida infections, lipid formulation AmB (3–5 mg/kg daily) is recommended (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence). Voriconazole 400 mg (6 mg/kg) twice daily for 2 doses, then 200 mg (3 mg/kg) twice daily is effective for candidemia, but offers little advantage over fluconazole as initial therapy (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence), and voriconazole is recommended as step-down oral therapy for selected cases of candidemia due to C. krusei (strong recommendation; low-quality evidence).

HIV opportunistic infection — Coccidioidomycosis treatment and maintenance therapy: For clinically mild infections (e.g., focal pneumonia), preferred therapy is Fluconazole 400 mg PO daily (AII) or Itraconazole 200 mg PO BID (BII); for bone or joint infections, Itraconazole 200 mg PO BID (AII) is preferred. For severe, non-meningeal infection (diffuse pulmonary infection or severely ill patients with extrathoracic, disseminated disease), use lipid formulation amphotericin B 3–5 mg/kg IV daily (AIII) or amphotericin B deoxycholate 0.7–1.0 mg/kg IV daily (AII), with duration of therapy continued until clinical improvement, then switch to a triazole (BIII). For meningeal infections, preferred therapy is Fluconazole 400–800 mg IV or PO daily (AII). Alternative therapy for mild infections that failed to respond to fluconazole or itraconazole includes Posaconazole 300 mg delayed-release tablet PO BID x 1 day, then once daily (BIII), Posaconazole 400 mg oral suspension PO BID (BII), or Voriconazole 200–400 mg PO BID (BIII); for bone or joint infection, Fluconazole 400 mg PO daily (BII) is an alternative; for severe, non-meningeal infection some specialists will add a triazole ("fluconazole" or itraconazole) 400 mg per day to amphotericin B therapy and continue triazole once amphotericin B is stopped (BIII). For meningeal infections, alternatives include Itraconazole 200 mg PO TID for 3 days, then 200 mg PO BID (BII), Voriconazole 200–400 mg PO BID (BIII), Posaconazole 300 mg delayed-release tablet PO BID x 1 day, then once daily (CIII), Posaconazole 400 mg oral suspension PO BID (CIII), or intrathecal amphotericin B deoxycholate when triazole antifungals are ineffective (AIII). Relapse can occur in 25%–33% of HIV-negative patients with diffuse pulmonary or disseminated disease; therapy should be given for at least 12 months and usually much longer, with discontinuation dependent on clinical and serological response and specialist input. Fluconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, and voriconazole may have significant interactions with other medications including ARV drugs; refer to Table 5 of Antiretroviral guidelines for dosage recommendations, and therapeutic drug monitoring and dosage adjustment may be necessary to ensure triazole antifungal and antiretroviral efficacy and reduce concentration-related toxicities. Intrathecal amphotericin B should only be given in consultation with a specialist and administered by an individual with experience with the technique.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Histoplasma capsulatum — long term suppressive therapy — Indications are severe disseminated or central nervous system (CNS) infection after completing ≥ 12 months of treatment (AIII), and relapse despite appropriate initial therapy (BIII). Preferred Therapy is itraconazole 200 mg PO once daily (AIII); alternatives are posaconazole 300 mg extended release tablet PO once daily (BIII), voriconazole 200 mg PO twice daily (BIII), and fluconazole 400 mg PO once daily (CII). Criteria for Discontinuing Long Term Suppressive Therapy (AI) are received azole treatment for > 1 year, negative fungal blood cultures, serum or urine Histoplasma antigen below the level of quantification, have an undetectable HIV viral load, and CD4 count > 150 cells/mm3 for ≥ 6 months in response to ART; the indication for restarting secondary prophylaxis is CD4 count < 150 cells/mm3 (BIII).

### Voriconazole-a new therapeutic agent with an extended spectrum of antifungal activity [^1121z7qL]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

Voriconazole is a new antifungal agent that can be given orally and intravenously. It has proven efficacy for treating candidosis and invasive aspergillosis as well as other mould infections, such as those caused by Fusarium and Scedosporium spp. The drug is generally well tolerated.

### Treatment of candidiasis… [^1157SL71]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Candidiasis is treated with antifungal medication.
- **Antifungal medications come in different forms**: creams, oral gels, pills, or intravenous.
- The type of antifungal, dose, and length of treatment depend on the type and severity of infection and the patient's overall health.
- Take antifungal medications as instructed for as long as directed. Treatment Vaginal candidiasis Treatment is usually an antifungal cream applied inside the vagina or a single dose of fluconazole taken by mouth. Creams can be sold over the counter, but testing is recommended before starting a treatment. If symptoms return, don't improve, or get worse after starting treatment, healthcare providers may adjust the treatment by prescribing:

- More doses of fluconazole taken by mouth.
- Other medicines applied inside the vagina, such as boric acid, nystatin, or flucytosine.

Candidiasis of the mouth and throat Mild to moderate infections: Treatment for most infections include an antifungal oral gel applied inside the mouth for 7–14 days. Types of antifungals used include clotrimazole, miconazole, or nystatin. Severe infections: Antifungal medication in pill form or through an IV. The most common type of antifungal used is fluconazole. Candidiasis of the esophagus The antifungal medication fluconazole is almost always used to treat candidiasis of the esophagus. It can be taken as a pill or, for severe infections, through an IV. Other antifungal medications may be used if fluconazole is not working. The initial recommended antifungal treatment for most adults is an echinocandin given through the vein. Fluconazole, amphotericin B, and other antifungal medications may also be appropriate in certain situations.

For Health Care ProvidersClinical Overview of Invasive Candidiasis. Length of treatment For bloodstream Candida infections, treatment should continue for 2 weeks after signs and symptoms have resolved and Candida yeasts are no longer in the bloodstream. Other forms of invasive candidiasis, such as infections in the bones, joints, heart, or central nervous system, usually need to be treated for a longer period of time.

### FDA to review study examining use of oral fluconazole (diflucan) in… [^113CarRM]. FDA (2019). Medium credibility.

Based on our reviews of several studies, FDA has determined that the available data do not provide conclusive evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage or stillbirth with a single 150 mg dose of oral fluconazole. We reviewed the 2016 study cited in this DSC and four additional epidemiological studies. We approved updated prescribing information in 2018 to include all available information on the use of fluconazole in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding. It adequately addresses the potential risk of harm to unborn babies. We will continue to monitor the safety of fluconazole as part of FDA's usual ongoing drug safety review and will communicate any new information to the public if it becomes available. The U. S. Food and Drug Administration is evaluating the results of a Danish study 1 that conclude there is a possible increased risk of miscarriage with the use of oral fluconazole for yeast infections.

We are also reviewing additional data and will communicate our final conclusions and recommendations when our review is complete. Health care professionals should be aware that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines recommend only using topical antifungal products to treat pregnant women with vulvovaginal yeast infections, including for longer periods than usual if these infections persist or recur. Patients who are pregnant or actively trying to get pregnant should talk to their health care professionals about alternative treatment options for yeast infections. Oral fluconazole is used to treat yeast infections of the vaginal area, mouth, and esophagus, which is the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach.

It is also used to treat a fungal infection of the brain and spinal cord called cryptococcal meningitis that most often affects people with weakened immune systems, and used to prevent yeast infections that can spread to the rest of the body in cancer patients who have a weakened immune system. It is available under the brand name Diflucan and also as generics. The current FDA drug label states that data available from studies in people do not suggest an increased risk of problems during pregnancy or abnormalities in developing babies when women are exposed to a single 150 mg dose of oral fluconazole to treat vaginal yeast infections. However, high doses of oral fluconazole taken by pregnant women for much longer than a single dose have resulted in reports of abnormalities at birth. In the Danish study.
