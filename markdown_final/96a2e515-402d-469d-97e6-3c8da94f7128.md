## Question

What does an elevated methylmalonic acid level indicate?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what an elevated methylmalonic acid (MMA) level indicates. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core biochemistry and primary disease associations of MMA elevation. Then, I should verify acquired causes, especially vitamin B12 deficiency, and how to differentiate them biochemically. Next, I will consider clinical contexts such as newborn screening versus symptomatic presentations. After that, I need to check for modifiers and confounders that can artifactually raise MMA. Finally, I will outline a practical diagnostic and management approach, while pausing to double-check key pitfalls and rare exceptions that could mislead interpretation.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical meaning: MMA is produced when methylmalonyl-CoA cannot be efficiently converted to succinyl-CoA, a mitochondrial step catalyzed by methylmalonyl-CoA mutase with adenosylcobalamin as cofactor, so sustained elevation usually reflects impaired flux through this node in propionate and branched-chain amino acid catabolism. Hold on, I should verify the scope: in inherited defects of MMUT or intracellular cobalamin processing, methylmalonyl-CoA accumulates and hydrolyzes to MMA, which becomes detectably elevated in plasma and urine and functions as a core disease biomarker for methylmalonic acidemia, although absolute specificity must be interpreted in clinical context.

> Wait, let me verify the two big etiologic buckets when MMA is high: primary inherited methylmalonic acidemia and acquired cobalamin deficiency, the latter being a functional block at the same enzymatic step due to lack of the AdoCbl cofactor [^113nBd9N]. I need to ensure the biomarker logic is correct: total homocysteine rises with both folate and B12 deficiency, whereas MMA is a specific marker of cobalamin-dependent metabolism and does not rise in isolated folate deficiency, so pairing MMA with homocysteine helps distinguish nutritional etiologies from other causes of MMA elevation [^114rbYbd].

> Next, I will now examine the inherited forms: isolated MMA presents with elevated MMA without hyperhomocysteinemia and is caused by pathogenic variants in MMUT or in cobalamin trafficking/synthesis genes such as MMAA and MMAB, whereas combined MMA with homocystinuria, often the cblC type from MMACHC mutations, features concomitant homocysteine elevation due to impaired methylcobalamin-dependent methionine synthase function as well [^113nBd9N] [^113HvGbq]. I should double-check subtyping implications because genotype and cobalamin responsiveness influence prognosis and therapy, with mut0 and cblB tending to be more severe than mut− or cblA in many cohorts [^111ZxLF8].

> But wait, what if the elevation is acquired rather than genetic? I need to consider vitamin B12 deficiency, including classic dietary or pernicious anemia–related deficiency and functional cobalamin deficiency in the elderly or those on metformin, where MMA rises despite normal serum B12 and can correlate with neuropathy, and where pharmacologic cobalamin often lowers MMA and improves symptoms in responsive patients [^1157ErBA] [^114Loki3] [^1157ErBA]. Hold on, I should verify that reliance on a single serum B12 level can mislead, since MMA and homocysteine are more sensitive indicators of functional deficiency in many ambulatory settings [^114rbYbd].

> I need to check for confounders and context that modulate MMA levels independent of enzyme or cofactor biology. Renal function affects MMA clearance and the gut microbiome's propionate production can influence the propionate pool, so elevations may be accentuated in kidney impairment or dysbiosis, and day-to-day variability is substantial, warranting cautious interpretation of single measurements, especially when diet or catabolic stress is changing [^1175FXAa] [^112wjH6s]. Hmm, wait a minute, there is also the paradox of elevated MMA with normal or high serum B12 in short-bowel syndrome, likely related to malabsorption and bacterial overgrowth, where empiric parenteral B12 can still reduce MMA, so I should confirm clinical context before dismissing a nutritional component [^115MpXif].

> Let me consider the newborn screening context carefully. Elevated propionylcarnitine with an increased C3/C2 ratio flags possible MMA or PA, but false positives are frequent, so confirmatory testing with urine organic acids for MMA and methylcitric acid, plasma acylcarnitines, and genetic testing is required, and integrating second-tier metabolic or DNA analyses can improve positive predictive value and reduce callbacks [^115mrVyv] [^111vZSAG] [^111SgRYa]. Hold on, I should verify that birth weight and other covariates can bias acylcarnitine profiles in screening algorithms, reinforcing the need for confirmatory diagnostics rather than relying solely on dried blood spot data [^111SgRYa].

> Next, I should review typical clinical phenotypes where an elevated MMA fits. In neonates and infants, acute presentations with vomiting, lethargy, metabolic acidosis, ketosis, and hyperammonemia during catabolic stress are classic for MMA, whereas later-onset disease may feature failure to thrive, neurodevelopmental impairment, renal tubulointerstitial disease, and cardiac complications, so I need to triangulate the lab data with age of onset and organ involvement before assigning etiology [^114iAGqi] [^116MqMqL]. Let me reconsider neurotoxicity risk: even mild or early derangements, especially hyperammonemia, can lead to brain injury, arguing for prompt recognition and aggressive stabilization while confirmatory work-up proceeds [^116URUqw].

> Now, I will outline a practical diagnostic pathway and double-check each step. First, I should confirm the MMA elevation with an appropriate matrix and method and in clinical stability when possible, then measure total homocysteine to separate isolated MMA from combined MMA-homocystinuria, and concurrently assess serum B12 while remembering that normal B12 does not exclude functional deficiency, especially if MMA and homocysteine are high [^114rbYbd] [^112wjH6s]. Next, I need to profile acylcarnitines for C3 and the C3/C2 ratio and perform urine organic acids to quantify MMA and methylcitric acid, then proceed to molecular testing for MMUT and cobalamin pathway genes, with enzyme studies or complementation assays if genetics are inconclusive; critically, in vivo cobalamin responsiveness testing with intramuscular hydroxocobalamin should be done when the patient is metabolically stable to inform therapy and prognosis [^115mrVyv] [^113uUfVH] [^115Ejttb] [^112tQ2Eq].

> Let me think about immediate management implications while awaiting full classification. For suspected inherited MMA, I should ensure avoidance of catabolism with adequate calories, restrict natural protein to reduce precursor flux, supplement carnitine, consider gut-directed strategies to reduce propionate production, and initiate hydroxocobalamin if a responsive subtype is possible, favoring intramuscular administration and formal biochemical response assessment to guide ongoing therapy [^112Dwu8C] [^115Ejttb]. I need to ensure antibiotic choices like metronidazole are used cautiously due to neuropathy risk and to consider alternative agents if intolerance occurs, and in refractory or severe cases, discuss the role and limitations of organ transplantation alongside emerging gene and mRNA therapies that are under investigation and may not normalize circulating metabolites despite hepatic correction [^115Ejttb] [^114wBNDV] [^1124vKHx] [^1175FXAa].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a single abnormal MMA. I should double-check for measurement variability and repeat testing after correcting reversible factors such as dehydration, renal dysfunction, dietary excess protein, or recent illness, because MMA, homocysteine, and B12-related markers can fluctuate and may not perfectly predict cobalamin-responsive disease on their own in ambulatory populations [^112wjH6s]. I also need to ensure that cobalamin responsiveness testing is performed outside acute decompensation to avoid false nonresponse and that normal serum B12 never precludes a therapeutic trial in high-risk settings given the low toxicity and potential benefit of treatment [^112tQ2Eq] [^116kWjba].

> But wait, what if it is not classic MMUT/cobalamin pathway disease or nutritional deficiency? Rarely, mitochondrial disorders such as SUCLA2-related encephalomyopathy can elevate MMA through downstream Krebs cycle impairment, and combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria due to ACSF3 mutations presents with a different biochemical pattern and often a benign clinical course, so I should confirm the full organic acid profile and consider expanded genetics if the phenotype and metabolite pattern do not fit common categories; methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase deficiency is also a rare cause with very low population prevalence [^115o4c6i] [^111n3LwP] [^115xKBai].

> Stepping back, I should synthesize the clinical message: an elevated MMA signifies impaired methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA conversion, most commonly due to inherited MMA or vitamin B12 deficiency, and interpretation hinges on pairing MMA with homocysteine, B12 status, renal function, acylcarnitines, and the clinical picture, followed by genetic confirmation and, when appropriate, cobalamin responsiveness testing in a metabolically stable state to tailor therapy and counseling [^114rbYbd] [^113nBd9N] [^115Ejttb]. Early recognition and targeted management reduce decompensation risk and long-term complications, but I need to verify confounders and avoid overcalling a diagnosis from a single value, repeating measurements after stabilization and intervening promptly when the risk of neurotoxicity is high [^112wjH6s] [^114iAGqi].

High methylmalonic acid (MMA) most often indicates **vitamin B12 deficiency** or **inherited forms of MMA** (MMUT or cobalamin pathway defects) [^113nBd9N] [^114rbYbd] but can also result from renal impairment, metformin [^114Loki3], nitrous oxide, or small-bowel bacterial overgrowth [^115MpXif]. Clinically, elevated MMA suggests **B12 deficiency, inherited MMA, or renal dysfunction** [^114rbYbd] and is confirmed by plasma or urine MMA alongside B12, homocysteine, and renal function tests; genetic testing defines MMA subtypes [^113uUfVH] [^114YgGmc] [^111SgRYa]. Management targets the cause: **B12 replacement** [^116kWjba]; **dietary protein restriction** [^111YR6cw], **carnitine**, and **metronidazole** [^115Ejttb] for MMA; and **transplant** [^114wBNDV] or emerging **gene/mRNA therapies** [^1124vKHx] for severe cases.

## Biochemical pathways and mechanisms

MMA is a **key intermediate in propionate metabolism**, formed from methylmalonyl-CoA and converted to succinyl-CoA by methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MMUT) with adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl) as a cofactor [^114rbYbd]. Defects in MMUT or AdoCbl synthesis cause MMA accumulation [^1148WRCV] [^113nBd9N].

---

## Causes of elevated methylmalonic acid

Elevated MMA arises from **genetic, nutritional, pharmacological, and renal factors**:

| **Category** | **Specific causes** |
|-|-|
| Genetic | - MMUT mutations (mut0, mut-) [^115oDhka] <br/> - Cobalamin pathway defects (cblA, cblB, cblC, cblD) [^113nBd9N] [^1148WRCV] <br/> - Methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase deficiency [^111HppbB] |
| Nutritional | - Vitamin B12 deficiency (dietary, malabsorption, pernicious anemia) [^114rbYbd] [^115wscRB] |
| Pharmacological | - Metformin (functional B12 deficiency) [^114Loki3] <br/> - Nitrous oxide (inactivates B12) |
| Renal impairment | - Reduced MMA clearance in chronic kidney disease [^114rbYbd] |

---

## Clinical significance and associated conditions

Elevated MMA is **clinically significant** and associated with:

- **Vitamin B12 deficiency**: Neuropathy [^114rbYbd], anemia, cognitive impairment [^115wscRB].
- **Inherited MMA**: Metabolic acidosis [^114iAGqi], hyperammonemia [^1148WRCV], neurologic impairment, renal disease [^113wmJ8b].
- **Renal impairment**: Reduced MMA clearance [^114rbYbd].
- **Metformin-associated neuropathy**: Functional B12 deficiency with neuropathy [^114Loki3].

---

## Diagnostic methods

Diagnosis relies on **biochemical and genetic testing**: Biochemical tests include plasma or urine MMA, serum B12, homocysteine, and renal function tests [^114rbYbd] [^112wjH6s], while **genetic testing** evaluates MMUT and cobalamin pathway genes (cblA, cblB, cblC, cblD) [^116y3tN9] [^1148WRCV] [^111SgRYa].

---

## Treatment strategies

Treatment depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Vitamin B12 deficiency**: High-dose oral or intramuscular B12 [^116kWjba] [^114rbYbd].
- **Inherited MMA**: Dietary protein restriction [^111YR6cw], carnitine, metronidazole [^115Ejttb]; transplant or gene/mRNA therapies for severe disease [^114wBNDV] [^1124vKHx].
- **Renal impairment**: Address renal dysfunction and consider dialysis if severe [^114rbYbd] [^111ZxLF8].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis varies by **cause and severity**:

- **Vitamin B12 deficiency**: Good with timely treatment; delayed therapy risks irreversible neurologic damage [^114rbYbd] [^112wjH6s].
- **Inherited MMA**: Risk of metabolic crises [^1148WRCV], neurologic impairment [^116MqMqL], renal failure, and early mortality [^115oDhka].
- **Renal impairment**: Persistent elevation and complications without renal management [^114rbYbd] [^113wmJ8b].

---

Elevated MMA reflects disrupted propionate metabolism due to genetic, nutritional, pharmacological, or renal causes [^113nBd9N], and **targeted diagnosis and therapy are essential** to prevent complications [^114rbYbd].

### Clinical and electroencephalogram characteristics of methylmalonic acidemia with MMACHC and MUT gene mutations [^1148WRCV]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Methylmalonic acidemia is an autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency in the methylmalonic acid CoA mutant enzyme or the enzyme metabolizing cobalamin (vitamin B12). In the body, four amino acids — ​isoleucine, methionine, threonine, and valine — ​odd-chain fatty acids, and cholesterol can produce propionyl CoA, which is then converted into methylmalonyl CoA and transported into the mitochondria for the tricarboxylic acid cycle via an enzymatic reaction. The conversion of propionyl CoA to methylmalonyl CoA requires the participation of enzymes, the most important of which is methylmalonyl CoA mutase and its coenzyme 5'-deoxyadenosine cobalamin (AdoCbl, which is derived from vitamin B12 through a series of enzymatic reactions). An innate genetic abnormality in the methylmalonyl CoA mutase or a disorder in any part of the conversion of vitamin B12 into an AdoCbl can lead to the accumulation of methylmalonyl CoA, causing methylmalonic acidemia. Additionally, another coenzyme, methylcobalamin (MeCbl), also derived from vitamin B12, is necessary to convert homocysteine to methionine. Impairment in this process can result in hyperhomocysteinemia.

Depending on the presence of homocysteinemia, methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) can be divided into isolated MMA or MMA with homocystinuria. Isolated MMA includes the mut– and mut0 types caused by mutations in the MUT gene, the cblA type caused by mutations in the MMAA gene, the cblB type caused by mutations in the MMAB gene, and the cblr type caused by mutations in the CD320 gene.

### Characterizing the mechanism of action for mRNA therapeutics for the treatment of propionic acidemia, methylmalonic acidemia, and phenylketonuria [^1124vKHx]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

MMA is primarily caused by a defect or deficiency in methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT), an enzyme that functions just downstream of PCC in the propionate metabolic pathway to catalyze the reversible isomerization of L-methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA. A deficiency in MUT blocks the propionate metabolism pathway, resulting in the accumulation of toxic metabolites, including methylmalonic acid, 2-MC, and C3. Given the defects in a shared metabolic pathway, patients with MMA experience similar outcomes as those with PA.

PKU is an autosomal recessive disorder that results in defects in phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH), the enzyme responsible for conversion of phenylalanine (Phe) to tyrosine. Defects in PAH lead to hyperphenylalaninemia, which can disrupt neurologic function, causing severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, and psychiatric problems.

The standards of care for each of these disorders center on symptom management or avoiding dietary components that exacerbate disease. For example, recommendations for patients with PA and MMA include management of acute metabolic decompensation events and diets low in natural proteins to reduce the precursor molecules that funnel into the defective metabolic pathways. While liver transplants for patients with PA and combined liver-kidney transplants for those with MMA have been shown to reduce the number of metabolic decompensations and improve biochemical markers, this practice does not eliminate the risk of disease-related complications. For patients with PKU, a Phe-restricted diet with pegvaliase-pqpz, tyrosine, and/or other treatments is recommended.

### Treatment of metabolic disorders using genomic technologies: Lessons from methylmalonic acidemia [^114wBNDV]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2022). High credibility.

Hereditary methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), caused by a deficiency of the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MMUT), is a relatively common and severe organic acidemia. The recalcitrant nature of the condition to conventional dietary and medical management has led to the use of elective liver and combined liver-kidney transplantation in some patients. However, liver transplantation is intrinsically limited by organ availability, the risks of surgery, procedural and lifelong management costs, transplant comorbidities, and a remaining underlying risk of complications related to MMA despite transplantation.

This paper reviews pre-clinical studies that present alternative approaches to solid organ transplantation as a treatment for MMUT MMA, including adeno-associated viral gene addition therapy, mRNA therapy, and genome editing, with and without nuclease enhancement. These novel therapies offer promising avenues for addressing the challenges posed by the limitations of traditional organ transplantation methods.

### Paradoxical elevation of both serum B12 and methylmalonic acid levels in assessing B12 status in children with short-bowel syndrome [^115MpXif]. JPEN. Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2020). Low credibility.

Measurement of vitamin B12 (B12) levels is routinely used to monitor B12 sufficiency. However, its accuracy may not be reliable in patients with short-bowel syndrome (SBS). The presence of elevated methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels can also be used as a marker for B12 deficiency. Therefore, our aim was to analyze serum B12 and MMA levels simultaneously in a cohort of children with SBS to evaluate the accuracy of these markers in the assessment of B12 status.

- **Methods**: Children ages 1–18 with intestinal failure were eligible for enrollment. MMA and B12 levels were checked simultaneously in all patients, with 93 sets of labs obtained over 2 years. Fifty percent of the patients were receiving parenteral nutrition. B12 injections were administered to 14 patients who had simultaneously elevated MMA and B12, and a repeat MMA level was measured 4–6 weeks after injection. Data were collected retrospectively.

- **Results**: Forty-eight percent of the lab pairs showed evidence of both elevated MMA and high or normal B12, which contradicted the expected inverse relationship of these markers. There was a statistically significant decrease in mean MMA values after treatment with B12 injections (412.7 vs. 1037.5, P = 0.001).

- **Conclusion**: Paradoxical elevation of MMA with normal or elevated serum B12 is common in children with SBS. Caution should be used when interpreting serum B12 and MMA values in this setting. This may be related to effects of small-bowel bacterial overgrowth, a condition commonly seen in these patients.

### Dietary practices in methylmalonic acidaemia: A European survey [^111YR6cw]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2020). Low credibility.

The dietary management of methylmalonic acidaemia (MMA) focuses on a low-protein diet that provides sufficient energy to avoid catabolism and limit the production of methylmalonic acid. The goal is to achieve normal growth, a good nutritional status, and the maintenance of metabolic stability. The aim of this study was to describe the dietary management of patients with MMA across Europe.

Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire was distributed to European colleagues managing inherited metabolic disorders (IMDs), with 53 participants responding. The questionnaire included 27 questions about the nutritional management of organic acidaemias. Data were analyzed by different age ranges: 0–6 months, 7–12 months, 1–10 years, 11–16 years, and over 16 years.

Results: Questionnaires were returned from 53 centers. Twenty-five centers cared for 80 patients with methylmalonic acidaemia vitamin B12 responsive (MMAB12r), and 43 centers managed 215 patients with methylmalonic acidaemia vitamin B12 non-responsive (MMAB12nr).

- **Dietary management for MMAB12r patients**: 44% of centers (11/25) prescribed natural protein below the World Health Organization/Food and Agriculture Organization/United Nations University (WHO/FAO/UNU) 2007 safe levels of protein intake in at least one age range. Precursor-free amino acids (PFAA) were prescribed by 40% of centers (10/25), caring for 36% (29/80) of all patients.

- **Dietary management for MMAB12nr patients**: 72% of centers (31/43) prescribed natural protein below the safe levels of protein intake (WHO/FAO/UNU 2007) in at least one age range. PFAA were prescribed by 77% of centers (33/43), managing 81% (174/215) of patients. In MMAB12nr patients, 42% (90 patients) required tube feeding: 25 via a nasogastric tube and 65 via a gastric tube.

### Association of metformin, elevated homocysteine, and methylmalonic acid levels and clinically worsened diabetic peripheral neuropathy [^114Loki3]. Diabetes Care (2010). Low credibility.

It is unclear whether Cbl supplementation will prevent clinical worsening in this group, but supplementation carries a low risk of toxicity. Therapy consists of intramuscular Cbl replacement therapy and possible long-term Cbl and folate therapy; oral Cbl supplementation may be as effective as intramuscular therapy, although long-term outcomes have not yet been examined in patients with DPN. Oral calcium supplementation has also been effective in reversing bioavailable Cbl deficiency in metformin-treated patients.

Further studies should better define differences in the electrophysiological profile of these groups. Potential central nervous system complications of Cbl deficiency, including myelopathy and cognitive impairment, should be considered as contributors to clinical status. The relationship among Cbl deficiency, elevated Hcy and MMA levels, and peripheral neuropathy is controversial and remains to be proven, but both Cbl deficiency and elevation of its serum metabolites are associated with the presence of a sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy.

Our findings are presented with some limitations. Although we identified patients prospectively, they were not randomly selected from a population with type 2 diabetes with or without DPN. Our sample size was not based on a predetermined power analysis. We did not identify a separate group of patients with asymptomatic DPN. We excluded patients with type 1 diabetes because of their expected limited metformin exposure and the potential for distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. Although A1C was not significantly different from expectations, the exact role in the study context remains to be clarified.

### Homocysteine and methylmalonic acid in diagnosis and risk assessment from infancy to adolescence [^114rbYbd]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

The concentration of total homocysteine (tHcy) in serum and plasma is elevated in both folate and cobalamin deficiencies, whereas methylmalonic acid (MMA) in serum, plasma, or urine is a specific marker of cobalamin function. The combined measurement of both metabolites is useful for the diagnosis and follow-up of these deficiency states. In addition, tHcy is elevated under various pathological states (e.g. renal failure), and hyperhomocysteinemia is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, cognitive dysfunction, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The diagnostic utility of tHcy and MMA concentrations as markers of folate and cobalamin deficiencies in healthy and diseased children has been documented.

This article briefly summarizes the biochemical background of tHcy and MMA and the associations of tHcy and MMA with various disease states and focuses on novel data obtained in infants, children, and adolescents, with emphasis on cobalamin status in infants. The utility of tHcy and MMA as indicators of cobalamin and folate deficiencies in adults can be extended to infants and older children. Furthermore, as in adults, tHcy is related to unhealthy lifestyle factors and is a risk factor for vascular disease. High MMA concentrations in newborns, occasionally denoted as benign methylmalonic aciduria, may reflect impaired cobalamin function.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of methylmalonic acidaemia and propionic acidaemia: First revision [^114iAGqi]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2021). Low credibility.

- **Clinical presentation**: A patient can only be diagnosed with MMA or PA when the physician recognizes the clinical picture suggestive of these conditions, which can be a challenging process as many of the clinical signs are non-specific. MMA and PA can present with acute, chronic, or intermittent symptoms, which can often aggravate or even occur for the first time following a 'trigger' event. Symptoms include vomiting, weight loss, hypoglycemia, neurological deterioration with hypotonia, irritability, and lethargy, eventually leading to coma in the case of an acute early onset neonatal presentation. This clinical presentation can be accompanied by biochemical findings of metabolic acidosis, ketosis, hyperlactatemia, and hyperammonemia. Triggers of an acute episode include, but are not limited to, post-partum neonatal stress and other forms of catabolic states induced by infection or prolonged fasting. Late-onset patients present with a wider range of signs, involving failure to thrive, a range of neurological symptoms (encephalopathy, developmental delay), and cardiac and kidney manifestations. We provide a slightly updated table of main and rare signs and symptoms occurring during the acute or chronic presentation of MMA or PA (Table 2).

	**TABLE 2**
	- Potential signs and symptoms at presentation observed in MMA and PA patients

- **Laboratory diagnosis**: When, based on clinical assessment and basic laboratory parameters or on an abnormal result from newborn screening, an organic acidaemia is suspected, the diagnosis of MMA or PA is achieved by measurements of organic acids in urine.

### Response of elevated methylmalonic acid to three dose levels of oral cobalamin in older adults [^116kWjba]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2002). Low credibility.

Because the effects of lower-dose oral cobalamin (Cbl) supplements on older people with cobalamin deficiency are not known, we determined whether oral Cbl supplements at three different dose levels would normalize elevated serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) and total homocysteine (tHcy) concentrations.

- **Design**: Sequential nonrandomized intervention study of three dose levels.

- **Settings**: Two university-based senior care clinics.

- **Participants**: Twenty-three older adults (aged ≥ 65) with serum Cbl levels of 221 pmol/L (300 pg/mL) or lower and serum MMA greater than 271 nmol/L, who had been enrolled in a previous screening study for Cbl deficiency (mean age 79 ± 9; 17 male, 6 female; 17 white, 6 other).

- **Intervention**: Sequential daily treatment with 25 microg oral cobalamin, followed by 100 microg and 1,000 microg cobalamin each for a 6-week period.

- **Measurements**: Serum MMA, tHcy, and other metabolites at baseline and after each 6-week dosing interval.

- **Results**: Treatment with 25 microg and 100 microg lowered but did not normalize MMA levels in most subjects. A dose of 1,000 microg/day proved to be the most effective in lowering MMA levels to within normal limits. Serum tHcy was normalized in six of 11 subjects who had elevated tHcy pretreatment with oral Cbl alone and in one subject in combination with a multivitamin.

- **Conclusions**: Most Cbl-deficient older people require more than 100 microg of oral Cbl to normalize serum MMA, which is a larger dose than is available in most standard multivitamins and Cbl supplements.

### Growth hormone deficiency associated with methylmalonic acidemia [^115x2C66]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

Poor growth is a common finding in patients with organic acidemias. Growth hormone (GH) therapy has been considered in the management of these disorders as a mode to enhance anabolism and lower the high levels of methylmalonic acid. We report two patients with methylmalonic acidemia (mut(o)) and GH deficiency. Both patients had persistently elevated serum concentrations of methylmalonic acid, which failed to respond to conventional therapy. In anticipation of using GH therapy to reduce high methylmalonic acid concentrations, the first patient underwent GH testing utilizing a provocative glucagon stimulation test and was found to be deficient. He was subsequently treated with GH and demonstrated improved growth, but his methylmalonic acid concentrations remained elevated. The second patient was also found to be GH deficient. These findings suggest that GH deficiency may be an etiologic factor in the poor growth seen in patients with organic acidemia.

### Isolated methylmalonic acidemia with unusual presentation mimicking diabetic ketoacidosis [^111RH1bE]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Hyperglycemic ketoacidosis is an acute, life-threatening condition requiring early etiologic recognition and management to prevent serious morbidity and mortality. The most common cause is diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Organic acidemias (OAs) are inheritable disorders caused by defects in protein metabolism resulting in acid accumulation. Patients with metabolic decompensation usually present with acidosis, with or without hypoglycemia. Hyperglycemia is a very rare manifestation. At least 16 cases of OAs presenting with hyperglycemia have been reported, of which six were diagnosed with isolated methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) and three of the six passed away due to late diagnosis.

- **Case description**: We describe a 2-year-old Thai girl who presented with hyperglycemia, acidosis, and ketosis. She has underlying delayed development, seizures, optic atrophy, and poor growth. An initial diagnosis of DKA was made, and standard treatment was started. After 4 hours of treatment, the patient partially responded; blood sugar decreased, but acidosis and ketonemia persisted. HbA1c was normal. Investigations to rule out OAs were performed. Markedly elevated urinary methylmalonic acid, consistent with MMA, was observed. Molecular and enzyme analyses confirmed the diagnosis of isolated MMA. Specific treatment for MMA, including protein restriction, high caloric fluid, carnitine, and vitamin B12, was promptly started. Clinical improvement was seen 4 days after initiating specific treatment.

Inherited metabolic disorders should be included in differential diagnosis in hyperglycemic presentations.

### Methylmalonic and propionic acidurias: Management without or with a few supplements of specific amino acid mixture [^115rC16n]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2006). Low credibility.

In a series of 137 patients with methylmalonic acidaemia (MMA) and propionic acidaemia (PA) diagnosed since the early 1970s, we report in more detail 81 patients (51 MMA and 30 PA) diagnosed between 1988 and 2005. In this series, 14% of patients died at initial access, revealing the disease before or despite treatment. Eighteen percent died later, and the remainder (68%) are still alive. All patients were treated with the same protocol of enteral feeds with a low-protein diet adjusted to individual tolerance, carnitine, antibiotics, and only occasional use of an amino acid (AA) mixture. Intensive follow-up and monitoring were conducted using measurements of urinary urea.

Thirty-nine patients with severe forms, followed for more than 3 years, are analyzed in particular detail. Of the 17 PA patients, 6 had moderate disability (all neonatal-onset forms), whereas 11 were normal or slightly delayed in their mental development. Four presented with cardiomyopathy, of whom 2 died. Of the 22 MMA patients, 13 presented in the neonatal period, of whom 3 died later, 2 are in renal failure, and only 5 are still alive and have normal or slightly delayed mental development. In the 9 patients with late-onset forms, there were no deaths, and all patients but one have normal mental development.

Among the 39 patients, only 40% were given an AA supplement at 3 years, and 50% between 6 and 11 years. The actual intake of natural protein was 0.92, 0.78, and 0.77 g/kg per day at 3, 6, and 11 years, respectively, in patients without AA supplementation, whereas it was 0.75, 0.74, and 0.54 g/kg per day in the group who received AA supplementation.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of methylmalonic acidaemia and propionic acidaemia: First revision [^111ZxLF8]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2021). Low credibility.

Early diagnosis and timely treatment are essential to improve survival and reduce morbidity in MMA and PA patients. Over time, the survival of these patients has improved. Improved survival seems to be due to enhanced treatment strategies and patient monitoring. However, the effect of individual treatment variables on survival is not clear from the present evidence. In MMA patients, survival also depends on age of onset and disease subtype; early-onset MMA patients, particularly those with mut 0 and cblB, have a higher mortality risk.

As soon as the diagnosis of MMA and PA is suspected, specific therapies should be initiated, and the patient should be referred to a specialist center, as some treatments and specialist knowledge are only available there. Intensive care treatment of patients with metabolic decompensation may be necessary if there is severe metabolic acidosis, with or without hyperammonaemia and hyperlactataemia. The specifics of these acute treatment modalities, including extracorporeal detoxification, have not been systematically studied yet. The contribution of individual treatments to improved survival over the last decades is unclear. The panel has intensively discussed the available evidence and developed principles based on expert opinions on how to approach treatment of an (imminent) acute metabolic decompensation in MMA and PA patients (Figure 3). It seems appropriate to advise against the primary use of sodium phenylbutyrate as an ammonia scavenger in MMA and PA, as it can lead to detrimental outcomes.

### Pathophysiology of propionic and methylmalonic acidemias. Part 1: complications [^116MqMqL]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2019). Low credibility.

Over the last decades, advances in clinical care for patients suffering from propionic acidemia (PA) and isolated methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) have resulted in improved survival. These advances were possible thanks to new pathophysiological insights. However, patients may still suffer from devastating complications, which largely determine the unsatisfying overall outcome. To optimize our treatment strategies, better insight into the pathophysiology of complications is needed.

Here, we perform a systematic data analysis of cohort studies and case reports on PA and MMA:

- **Hypotheses and evidence**: For each of the prevalent and rare complications, we summarize the hypotheses and evidence for the underlying pathophysiology of that complication. A common hypothesis on the pathophysiology of many of these complications is that mitochondrial impairment plays a major role.

Assuming that complications in which mitochondrial impairment may play a role are overrepresented in monogenic mitochondrial diseases, and conversely, that complications in which mitochondrial impairment does not play a role are underrepresented in mitochondrial disease, we studied the occurrence of the complications in PA and MMA in mitochondrial and other monogenic diseases using data provided by the Human Phenotype Ontology. Lastly, we combined this with evidence from literature to draw conclusions on the possible role of mitochondrial impairment in each complication.

Altogether, this review provides a comprehensive overview of what we, at the time of writing, do and do not understand about the pathophysiology of complications occurring in PA and MMA.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of methylmalonic acidaemia and propionic acidaemia: First revision [^113uUfVH]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2021). Low credibility.

As the propionyl-CoA carboxylase enzyme requires biotin as a cofactor, nutritional biotin deficiency or a defect of the enzymes biotinidase (BTD gene, OMIM #609019) or holocarboxylase synthetase (HLCS gene, OMIM #609018) must be excluded to finalize the diagnosis of PA. In all these cases, the urinary organic acid profiles would not only include elevated levels of the metabolites pathognomonic for PA (3-hydroxypropionate and 2-methylcitrate), but also other metabolites arising from deficiencies of other biotin-dependent carboxylases such as methylcrotonylglycine.

Both MMA and PA are inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. To confirm the biochemical diagnosis, guide management, and allow genetic counselling of families, it is necessary to identify the underlying genetic defect. Isolated MMA can be caused by defects in four different genes, including MMUT (mut subtypes), MMAA (cblA), MMAB (cblB), and MMADHC (cblD-MMA). Specific mutations in MMADHC can also lead to a combined phenotype of MMA and homocystinuria or isolated homocystinuria. In the rare case of inconclusive genetic results, complementation studies, the propionate incorporation assay, or enzyme activity measurements in fibroblasts can aid in the diagnostic process. Many of the known MMUT mutations have been functionally tested with the aforementioned assays, allowing the historic classification as a mut 0 subtype (no response to hydroxocobalamin supplementation in the propionate incorporation assay) or a mut − subtype (increased propionate incorporation upon addition of hydroxocobalamin to the cell culture).

### Molecular and biochemical alterations in tubular epithelial cells of patients with isolated methylmalonic aciduria [^113wmJ8b]. Human Molecular Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Methylmalonic acidurias (MMAurias) are a group of inherited disorders in the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids, odd-chain fatty acids, and cholesterol caused by complete or partial deficiency of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (mut(0) and mut(-) subtype respectively) and by defects in the metabolism of its cofactor 5'-deoxyadenosylcobalamin (cblA, cblB or cblD variant 2 type). A long-term complication found in patients with mut(0) and cblB variant is chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis. The underlying pathomechanism has remained unknown.

We established an in vitro model of tubular epithelial cells from patient urine (hTEC; 9 controls, 5 mut(0), 1 cblB). In all human tubular epithelial cell (hTEC) lines, we found specific tubular markers (AQP1, UMOD, AQP2). Patient cells showed disturbance of energy metabolism in glycolysis, mitochondrial respiratory chain, and Krebs cycle in concert with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Electron micrographs indicated increased autophagosome production and endoplasmic reticulum stress, which was supported by positive acridine orange staining and elevated levels of LC3 II, P62 and pIRE1.

Screening mTOR signaling revealed a release of inhibition of autophagy. Patient hTEC produced and secreted elevated amounts of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL8, which was highly correlated with the acridine orange staining. Summarizing, hTEC of MMAuria patients are characterized by disturbed energy metabolism and ROS production that lead to increased autophagy and IL8 secretion.

### Prevalence of rare diseases: Bibliographic data [^115xKBai]. Orphanet Report Series (2024). High credibility.

### Diabetes as a cause of clinically significant functional cobalamin deficiency [^1157ErBA]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Functional cobalamin (Cbl) deficiency, characterized by high methylmalonic acid (MMA) values despite normal serum Cbl levels, is common in the elderly and is associated with neuropathy and anemia. Given the prevalence of diabetes in the elderly and the similarity between diabetic neuropathy and Cbl deficiency neuropathy, this study explores the role of diabetes in functional Cbl deficiency.

- **Research design and methods**: A retrospective review was conducted involving ambulatory community-dwelling adults with normal renal function who were evaluated for Cbl deficiency over a 12-year period in a primary care setting. Functional Cbl deficiency was identified by MMA values > 250 nmol/L with Cbl levels > 400 pg/mL.

- **Results**: In nondiabetic subjects, MMA values showed a direct correlation with age and an inverse correlation with serum Cbl. Conversely, in diabetic subjects, MMA values increased with age but did not decrease as Cbl levels increased. When Cbl levels were > 400 pg/mL, mean MMA values and the incidence of functional Cbl deficiency were notably higher in elderly diabetic subjects (at least 70 years old) compared to their nondiabetic counterparts. Additionally, neuropathy was present in 62% of diabetic subjects with elevated MMA values, compared to only 18% of diabetic subjects with normal MMA values. Pharmacologic doses of Cbl improved MMA values and neuropathy in 88% and 86% of evaluable diabetic subjects, respectively.

These findings suggest that functional Cbl deficiency is prevalent among elderly diabetic individuals, is linked to neuropathy, and responds well to Cbl therapy. A role for oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of functional Cbl deficiency remains to be further elaborated.

### Clinical spectrum and genetic variation of six patients with methylmalonic aciduria (MMA); a report from Iran [^113AsSwV]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Methylmalonic acidemia (MMAs) is known as a severe, complex, and lethal disorder of methylmalonate and cobalamin. Patients with MMA may have developmental, neurological, and metabolic disorders such as liver disease. Here, we aim to evaluate six Iranian patients suspected of having MMA disorder.

We provided genetic results, biochemical analyses, and treatment for these patients. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and variant screening in probands by whole exome sequencing (WES) were performed. A total of six homozygous variants were identified, including five previously identified variants and one novel variant. The variants were found in two MMA-causing genes as follows: c.577G > C, c.290+69G > T, c.662T > A, c.290+69G > T of MMAB, and c.100dupA, c.394C > T of MMACHC. Sanger sequencing confirmed the identified variants. Additionally, metabolomics data analysis reliably identified elevated C3 and MMA levels, as well as abnormalities in the amino acid profile, indicating the presence of pathogenic variants.

Our findings expand the global spectrum of genotypes in MMA. While WES, combined with metabolomics and biochemical analysis, offers valuable insights for accurate diagnosis and subtyping of MMA, it is most beneficial in complex cases where clinical findings are unclear.

### Acrodermatitis acidaemica [^116XEa68]. Clinical and Experimental Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Methylmalonic acidaemia (MMA) is an inborn error of amino acid metabolism that may be associated with cutaneous manifestations mimicking other diagnoses, including staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS), psoriasis, and acrodermatitis enteropathica. Whether this is due to the underlying metabolic disorder itself or occurs as a consequence of dietary restriction has yet to be elucidated. Skin biopsies typically show histological features shared by a number of other metabolic disorders and nutritional deficiency-associated diseases. Some presentations, especially SSSS-like eruptions, may be associated with acute metabolic decompensation. An underlying metabolic disorder, such as MMA, should be considered in a diagnosed adult or undiagnosed child presenting with skin eruptions that resemble those listed above, so that specialist management may be initiated early.

### Clinical and electroencephalogram characteristics of methylmalonic acidemia with MMACHC and MUT gene mutations [^114YgGmc]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Low credibility.

The clinical manifestations of methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) vary, and its diagnosis based on clinical symptoms alone is difficult. The possibility of an inherited metabolic disease should be considered when unexplained neurological or other systemic abnormalities are present. Biochemical examination, plasma acylcarnitine analysis, urine organic acids testing, and genetic tests confirm the diagnosis of MMA. The condition has a high mortality rate and a poor prognosis; therefore, early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to reduce irreversible complications.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of methylmalonic acidaemia and propionic acidaemia: First revision [^115Ejttb]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2021). High credibility.

Metronidazole, administered at 10 to 20 mg/kg/day in two to three doses, has become a part of the standard long-term management to reduce bacterial propionate production in the gut, despite low-quality evidence supporting its benefits. There is no evidence of neuropathy as an intrinsic long-term complication in MMA or PA patients. However, peripheral neuropathy has been observed in PA patients under metronidazole treatment, and metronidazole is a known cause of peripheral neuropathy. Other side effects include QTc prolongation and pancreatitis; thus, metronidazole should be cautiously used in MMA and PA patients. If metronidazole is not well tolerated, alternative antibiotics, including amoxicillin or cotrimoxazole, may be considered.

Whether carglumic acid can consistently reduce the number of metabolic decompensations requires further study. It has been tried to anapleurotically support Krebs cycle function by providing citrate, which was associated with a reduced number of hospitalizations in three PA patients.

Some MMA patients clearly benefit from parenteral cobalamin treatment. Patients with cblA mostly improve, and cblB cases have shown a one-third response rate. Among the MMUT-deficient patients, the mut− subgroup is more likely to benefit from cobalamin injections, although clear evidence of cobalamin responsiveness in mut− patients is lacking. The ideal application route is intramuscular, and hydroxocobalamin is the preferred form of the cobalamin molecule. A protocol to evaluate biochemical responsiveness has been proposed.

### Combining newborn metabolic and DNA analysis for second-tier testing of methylmalonic acidemia [^111SgRYa]. Genetics in Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Newborn metabolic pattern analysis using Random Forest

We trained a machine learning classifier based on Random Forest (RF) that utilized 46 MS/MS analytes to distinguish true and false-positive MMA cases. Without changing the 96.1% sensitivity of MMA screening (99 of 103 true positives detected, 4 false negatives), RF reduced the number of MMA false positives from 502 to 244 (49%) and increased the positive predictive value (PPV) from 16.5 to 28.9%. The MDA index was used to identify the individual contribution of specific MS/MS analytes and covariates in our RF model. Comparing the MDA index results between two RF models showed similar ranking for a number of metabolic analytes (e.g. C3/C2, free carnitine, methionine, C4, arginine). Among the four covariates tested, newborn birth weight was the highest ranked covariate. RF analysis of two MMA phenotypic subgroups showed significant differences in analyte ranking for patients with mutase deficiency (e.g. C3/C2, C3, C12:1, C18OH) compared with patients with a cobalamin disorder (e.g. methionine, C3/C2, C18:2). Of the 95 MMA patients, RF misclassified only 15 mut 0/- patients as CblC, D, or F (or vice versa) with an error rate of 16%. Finally, of the 60 MMA cases sequenced, RF confirmed all 30 MMA cases as true positives and reduced the number of MMA false positives from 30 to 15.

Newborn metabolic pattern analysis with Random Forest (RF) shows a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for newborns with and without MMA.

### Cobalamin-responsive disorders in the ambulatory care setting: Unreliability of cobalamin, methylmalonic acid, and homocysteine testing [^112wjH6s]. Blood (2005). Low credibility.

Early recognition of cobalamin (Cbl)-responsive disorders in the ambulatory care setting is essential to prevent irreversible neurologic deficits. However, diagnostic algorithms using Cbl, methylmalonic acid (MMA), and homocysteine (HCys) measurements reflect studies conducted in academic centers, and their negative predictive values have not been established.

Records of 456 ambulatory patients evaluated for Cbl deficiency at a staff model HMO were reviewed. Pretherapy Cbl, MMA, and HCys values in individual patients varied by 23%, 23%, and 17%, respectively, over 2 to 6 weeks. Hematologic or neurologic responses to pharmacologic doses of Cbl occurred in 37 of the 95 evaluable patients. In these patients, pretherapy Cbl, MMA, and HCys values were normal in 54%, 23%, and 50%, respectively. If therapy had been restricted to symptomatic patients with both low or intermediate Cbl levels and increased metabolite values, 63% of responders would not have been treated.

Twenty-five patients did not respond to treatment, including 5 of 11 patients (45%) with low Cbl, 22 of 49 patients (45%) with high MMA, and 13 of 30 patients (43%) with high HCys values. It is concluded that Cbl, MMA, and HCys levels fluctuate over time and neither predict nor preclude the presence of Cbl-responsive hematologic or neurologic disorders.

### Newborn screening for propionic, methylmalonic acidemia and vitamin B12 deficiency. Analysis of 588,793 newborns [^111vZSAG]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

We present the results of our experience in the diagnosis and follow-up of positive cases for propionic and methylmalonic acidemias, as well as cobalamin deficiencies (PA/MMA/MMAHC), since the Expanded Newborn Screening was implemented in the Madrid Region.

- **Methods**: Dried blood samples were collected 48 hours after birth. Amino acids and acylcarnitines were quantitated by MS/MS. Newborns with alterations were referred to clinical centers for follow-up. Biochemical and molecular genetic studies for confirmation of a disease were performed.

- **Results**: During the period from 2011 to 2020, 588,793 children were screened. Of these, 953 were referred to clinical units for abnormal results (192 for elevated C3 levels). Among those referred, 88 were false positive cases, 85 were maternal vitamin B12 deficiencies, and 19 were confirmed to have an inborn error of metabolism (8 PA, 4 MMA, 7 MMAHC). Ten out of 19 cases displayed symptoms before the newborn screening results (6 PA, 1 MMA, 3 MMAHC). C3, C16:1OH+C17 levels and C3/C2 and C3/Met ratios were higher in newborns with PA/MMA/MMAHC. Cases diagnosed with B12 deficiency had mean B12 levels of 187.6 ± 76.9 pg/mL and their mothers 213.7 ± 95.0 pg/mL; 5% of the mothers were vegetarian or had poor eating habits, while 15% were diagnosed with pernicious anemia. Newborns and their mothers received treatment with B12 with different dosages, which normalized their levels and led to the disappearance of secondary alterations.

- **Conclusions**: Elevated C3 levels are a frequent cause of abnormal results in newborn screening, with a high rate of false positive cases. Presymptomatic diagnosis of most PA and some MMA/MMAHC cases is difficult.

### Biomarkers for drug development in propionic and methylmalonic acidemias [^115mrVyv]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2022). Low credibility.

Acylcarnitines are intermediates of oxidative metabolism that consist of an acyl group esterified to a carnitine molecule. They derive from acyl-CoAs and are generated by both mitochondrial and peroxisomal enzymes, including carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT-1), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2 (CPT-2), carnitine acetyltransferase, and other not fully characterized enzymes. Their primary purpose is transporting long-chain fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane for β-oxidation or to bind and remove abnormal metabolites. Patients with defects in branched-chain amino acid catabolism or inherited disorders of fatty acid metabolism accumulate disease-specific acylcarnitines in body fluids.

Long-chain acylcarnitines (LCACs) are implicated in several biological processes, including cardiac function, ion balance, insulin signaling in muscle, inflammation, cellular stress, and modulation of protein kinase C. However, a specific physiological role or toxicity of C3 has not been demonstrated. Probably the most well-characterized clinical application of measurement of C3 is in newborn screening, where it is elevated in MMA and PA. In an affected newborn, acetylcarnitine (C2) is usually normal, and thus the C3/C2 ratio (a proxy for propionyl-CoA/acetyl-CoA) can be elevated up to 20-fold. A C3/C2 ratio of > 0.4 suggests a diagnosis of PA/MMA, but the false-positive rate is high. In general, the level of C3 reflects disease severity, but the relationship is imperfect as it can also vary according to diet and is affected by kidney disease.

Other acylcarnitines and related details are not provided in the remaining text.

### Long-term follow-up of Chinese patients with methylmalonic acidemia of the cblC and mut subtypes [^115VbPK7]. Pediatric Research (2025). High credibility.

The MMA prognosis depends largely on the subtypes. Despite similar poor prognosis rates of around 70%, mut-MMA patients have a markedly higher mortality rate and higher levels of all four MMA biochemical indicators after treatment when compared to cblC-MMA patients. These findings indicate a worse outcome in the mut-MMA group, which may be attributed to the more frequent episodes of acute metabolic decompensation, earlier onset, and lower VitB12-responsive rate of mut-MMA patients.

Furthermore, the pre-treatment onset and unresponsiveness to VitB12 treatment were also independently associated with poor prognosis and neurologic disorders in mut-MMA patients, as evidenced by our multivariate analysis and previous studies. Moreover, elevated baseline levels of C3 and C3/C2 were predicted as independent positive predictors of death and anemia in mut-MMA patients, respectively. In MMA, a significant quantity of propionyl-CoA is unable to be converted to succinyl-CoA to enter the TCA cycle due to enzyme defects and needs to be combined with carnitine to form C3 for excretion. Therefore, elevated C3 can be an indicator of abnormal propionate catabolism. C3/C2 were considered a more specific metabolic indicator than C3.

Consequently, abnormal propionate metabolism was highly correlated with death and anemia observed in mut patients, which requires strict monitoring and control. Finally, the c.914T > C variant in the MMUT gene, specific to the Chinese population, was identified as an independent risk factor for mortality, emphasizing the importance of rigorous management.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of methylmalonic acidaemia and propionic acidaemia: First revision [^116y3tN9]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2021). High credibility.

The first guidelines on isolated methylmalonic acidaemia (MMA) and propionic acidaemia (PA) were published in September 2014, accessed over 53,000 times on the journal's website, and cited 182 times according to the Web of Science (July 2020). The attention received signifies the interest and utilization by healthcare professionals of this evidence evaluation and the recommendations provided by an expert panel. Especially in the rare disease field, a structured evaluation of the present evidence is of great value, as the process involves specific considerations related to the rarity of these disorders. High-quality trials in large samples, which would produce firm and reliable evidence, are scarce given the small patient populations, often rendering the present evidence low quality. As a result, evidence collected from case series or smaller studies needs to be carefully evaluated.

The advances in the field and the success of the first MMA/PA guidelines prompted us to provide an update six years later. The updated guidelines presented here use a different and more up-to-date system to evaluate evidence than the first version, the 'Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation' (GRADE) approach, which is more suitable for the rare disease field as it partially accounts for the described challenges. Due to the change in methods, the entire body of literature on MMA and PA referenced on PubMed was reevaluated. Since the publication of the initial guidelines, new advances have been made, and more data have been incorporated into our current understanding.

### Methylmalonic acidemia with recurrent hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis: A case report and review of the literature [^116XLcxC]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

Methylmalonic acidemia is an autosomal recessive disorder of propionate catabolism, characterized by the accumulation of branched-chain amino acid metabolites such as propionylcarnitine (C3), 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-OH-PA), methylcitric acid (MCA), and methylmalonic acid (MMA) in the plasma, urine, and other body fluids. Isolated methylmalonic acidemia refers to the presence of excess MMA without homocysteine elevation, primarily caused by complete or partial deficiency of the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT), encoded by MUT. Other probable causes include defects in the transport or synthesis of its cofactor, 5-deoxy-adenosyl-cobalamin, and deficiency of the enzyme methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase.

The global incidence is believed to be 1:50,000 for isolated cases, whereas in Japan, neonatal screening by tandem mass spectrometry has revealed an incidence of 1:120,000. Patients may present shortly after birth with acute deterioration, metabolic acidosis, and hyperammonemia, or later at any age, with diverse clinical manifestations. Severe presentations can result in early mortality or progressive neurological comorbidities. Hematological abnormalities such as anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia are well-known complications of methylmalonic acidemia. However, data on the development of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) in these patients are scarce.

### Brain damage by mild metabolic derangements in methylmalonic acidemia [^116URUqw]. Pediatric Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Methylmalonic acidemia is caused by an l-methylmalonyl-CoA mutase deficiency. The mut(0) type is associated with significant mortality and morbidity, but tandem mass spectrometry has made early detection possible. Five patients were identified through newborn screening for elevated propionylcarnitine (C3-carnitine) levels. These patients received a positive screening result at a median age of 10 days (range, 5–18 days). When treated at a median age of 11 days (range, 3–50 days), two patients were asymptomatic, and only one was significantly acidotic (pH < 7.2), but all had various degrees of hyperammonemia (range, 127–1,244 μmol/L). Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was performed in four patients shortly after diagnosis, and the results were all abnormal.

Four patients were followed. There was no further metabolic decompensation after the initial episodes, but their mean developmental quotient was only 50. These results suggest that early hyperammonemia can lead to significant brain damage in methylmalonic acidemia. Therefore, treatment of this disease in newborns must be more aggressive.

### Genetic testing is necessary for correct diagnosis and treatment in patients with isolated methylmalonic aciduria: a case report [^114zc5XY]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

The second patient, with clear cobalamin (Cbl) sensitivity, was confirmed as the CblA type. The Leu89Pro variant in the MMAA gene found in Patient 2 seems to cause severe protein destabilization, corresponding with very early onset of symptoms in our patient, as well as in two other patients reported in the literature. Another patient homozygous for this variant has been described with a later onset at 11 months but with severe neurological complications. Impaired propionate incorporation reported in patient fibroblasts carrying the Leu89Pro variant, in addition to a null variant, clearly showed increased propionate incorporation in the presence of hydroxocobalamin (OH-Cbl), which is typical for the CblA type and in agreement with the cobalamin sensitivity of Patient 2.

- **Severe neonatal manifestation**: Severe neonatal manifestation of Cbl-responsive isolated methylmalonic aciduria (iMMA) could be misleading in the identification of the iMMA type. The severe course is typical for Cbl non-responsive forms. Horster et al. showed that 73% of mut 0 patients developed symptoms within the first week of life. Both of our patients had a neonatal manifestation with high excretion of methylmalonic acid in the urine, which is typical for Cbl non-responsive types of iMMA.

- **Cbl sensitivity test**: The Cbl sensitivity test helps to discern between Cbl-responsive and non-responsive forms. It is an important part of the diagnostic process, as no child should be given unnecessary or ineffective treatment, especially by injection. The test for early identification of Cbl-sensitive patients should be performed prior to receiving the results from enzymological and genetic testing.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of methylmalonic acidaemia and propionic acidaemia: First revision [^113nBd9N]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2021). Low credibility.

This first revision of the MMA and PA guidelines covers the same subtypes of isolated MMA and PA as before. MMA is caused by a deficiency of the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase enzyme (MMUT), either by a direct defect of the enzyme or by a deficient synthesis of its cofactor adenosylcobalamin. Precursors of this pathway are derived from specific amino acids (valine, isoleucine, threonine, methionine), propionate produced by gut bacteria, odd-chain fatty acids, and the cholesterol side chain (Figure 1).

Under isolated MMA, the following gene defects are included: deficiencies of MMUT (OMIM #251000), MMAA (OMIM #251100), MMAB (OMIM #251110), and truncating mutations towards the N-terminal in the MMADHC gene (OMIM #277410). PA (OMIM #606054) is caused by mutations in the PCCA (OMIM #232000) or PCCB gene (OMIM #232050), resulting in deficiency of propionyl-CoA carboxylase enzyme function.

- **Figure 1**:

Propionyl-CoA is metabolized in the mitochondria by specific enzymes. Defects in the genes MMUT, MMAA, MMAB, or MMADHC (more specifically variant 2) lead to isolated MMA, whereas defects in PCCA or PCCB lead to PA. Propionyl-CoA is derived from various sources and is metabolized to alternative products in the case of accumulation in the above-described defects. In addition, accumulating methylmalonyl-CoA in isolated MMA is hydrolyzed to methylmalonic acid, the main biomarker of this disease. Gene names are italicized; complementation groups are in parenthesis. MMA, methylmalonic acidaemia; PA, propionic acidaemia.

### 1-C-propionate breath testing as a surrogate endpoint to assess efficacy of liver-directed therapies in methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) [^1175FXAa]. Genetics in Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

The lack of curative therapies for MMA has encouraged the development of alternative approaches to restore enzyme activity, including adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated gene therapy, systemic messenger RNA (mRNA) therapy, and genome editing. While murine models have repeatedly demonstrated that plasma metabolites, such as methylmalonic acid, can be robust markers of hepatic correction, in MMA patients, serum and urine methylmalonic acid, propionylcarnitine, and 2-methylcitric acid can be highly variable, both between and within patients, and directly influenced by dietary protein intake, the gut microbiome, and renal function. Furthermore, in contrast to other disorders such as maple syrup urine disease, metabolites remain massively elevated after successful liver transplantation. Given that mouse models of MMA demonstrated increased 1–13 C-propionate oxidation in response to liver-directed MMUT gene therapy, even in the setting of an expanded circulating methylmalonic acid pool, we sought to explore the use of stable isotopes to quantify in vivo hepatic MMUT function in MMA patients.

Stable isotope tracers provide a safe, nonradioactive analysis of the metabolic fate of a specific compound at the whole-body level and can be administered to patients of all age groups, including newborns. Early studies performed in a small number of patients with methylmalonic and propionic acidemia (MMA, PA) used intravenous administration of radiolabeled 1–14 C-valine or propionate to demonstrate that the metabolism of labeled propionate to 14 CO2 was rapid in controls.

### Biomarkers of cobalamin (vitamin B-12) status in the epidemiologic setting: A critical overview of context, applications, and performance characteristics of cobalamin, methylmalonic acid, and holotranscobalamin II [^115wscRB]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

Cobalamin deficiency is relatively common; however, the majority of cases in epidemiologic surveys involve subclinical cobalamin deficiency (SCCD) rather than classical clinical deficiency. SCCD lacks known clinical expression and relies solely on biochemical biomarkers for diagnosis, whose optimal application remains unsettled. This review critically examines the diagnostic concepts, tools, and interpretations, beginning with the understanding that SCCD differs from clinical deficiency not just in the degree of deficiency but in fundamental pathophysiology, causes, likelihood and rate of progression, and known health risks, the causation of which by SCCD awaits validation through randomized clinical trials. Consequently, conclusions from SCCD data may not apply to clinical deficiency and vice versa. Although some researchers see cobalamin testing as unreliable, cobalamin, like all diagnostic biomarkers, performs satisfactorily in clinical deficiency, albeit less effectively in SCCD.

The lack of a diagnostic gold standard limits the ability to evaluate the performance characteristics of metabolic biomarkers such as methylmalonic acid (MMA) and holotranscobalamin II, whose specificities remain incompletely defined outside their relationships to each other. Variable cutoff selections significantly affect diagnostic conclusions and require better rationalization. Maximizing the reliability and specificity of diagnoses is more crucial today than identifying earlier stages of SCCD. The limitations of all biomarkers emphasize the necessity for a combination of approaches in diagnosis.

### Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with elevated methylmalonic acid is caused by SUCLA2 mutations [^115o4c6i]. Brain (2007). Low credibility.

We have identified 12 patients with autosomal recessive mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with elevated methylmalonic acid. The disorder has a high incidence of 1 in 1700 in the Faroe Islands due to a founder effect and a carrier frequency of 1 in 33. The symptoms include hypotonia, muscle atrophy, hyperkinesia, severe hearing impairment, and postnatal growth retardation. Neuroimaging showed demyelination and central and cortical atrophy, including atrophy of the basal ganglia, and some of the patients fulfilled the criteria for Leigh syndrome.

Urine and plasma methylmalonic acid were elevated. Homozygosity mapping with the Affymetrix 10 K array revealed a homozygous region on chromosome 13q14 harboring the SUCLA2 gene. Mutations in SUCLA2 were recently shown to cause a similar disorder in a small Israeli family. Mutation analysis identified a novel splice site mutation in SUCLA2, IVS4 + 1G → A, leading to skipping of exon 4.

The SUCLA2 gene encodes the ATP-forming beta subunit of the Krebs cycle enzyme succinyl-CoA ligase. The hallmark of the condition, elevated methylmalonic acid, can be explained by an accumulation of the substrate of the enzyme, succinyl-CoA, which in turn leads to elevated methylmalonic acid because the conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA is inhibited.

### Cardiac disease in methylmalonic acidemia [^114Vs727]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) is a heterogeneous disorder, with onset ranging from infancy to adulthood and varying degrees of organ involvement and severity. While cardiac disease is a known lethal complication of other organic acidemias, it has not been typically associated with MMA. We identified three patients with MMA and cardiac disease.

### Clinical and biochemical studies on Chinese patients with methylmalonic aciduria [^115BETbS]. Journal of child neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Methylmalonic aciduria is a common organic aciduria disease. Recently, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry has been used to diagnose methylmalonic aciduria in China. Often, however, the diagnosis of methylmalonic aciduria is delayed because of a lack of technical expertise and the limited experience of general clinicians in China.

In this study, the natural history, clinical features, and outcomes of 77 Chinese patients with methylmalonic aciduria were investigated. Of the 77 patients, 31 (40.3%) had isolated methylmalonic aciduria and 46 (59.7%) had methylmalonic aciduria combined with homocystinemia. Thus, we observed a higher rate of the combined disease than studies conducted in other countries, suggesting that it might be more common in China. Total plasma homocysteine measurement might enable differential diagnoses of methylmalonic aciduria to be distinguished.

The clinical spectrum of these 77 patients with methylmalonic aciduria ranged from neonatal death and severe symptoms to benign asymptomatic organic aciduria. Neonatal and infantile onset, which was a characteristic of the majority of cases, was associated with a greater severity relative to later-onset cases. Among the 17 cases who had onset after 3 years of age, only 1 patient had isolated methylmalonic aciduria and 16 had combined methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinemia. Nine of the patients with combined methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinemia completely recovered and exhibited normal intelligence, whereas seven improved, with a mild handicap.

### Evaluation of the clinical, biochemical, genotype and prognosis of-type methylmalonic acidemia in 365 Chinese cases [^115oDhka]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2023). High credibility.

Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), resulting from defects in methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (mut type) or its cofactor, is the most common inherited organic acid metabolic disease in China. This study aimed to investigate the phenotype and genotype of mut-type MMA in Chinese patients.

- **Methods**: We recruited 365 patients with mut-type MMA. We investigated their disease onset, newborn screening (NBS) status, biochemical metabolite levels, gene variations, and prognosis. Additionally, we explored the relationship between phenotype and genotype.

- **Results**: There were 152 patients diagnosed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) expanded NBS, 209 patients diagnosed due to disease onset without NBS, and 4 cases diagnosed due to sibling diagnosis. The median age of onset was 15 days old, with a variety of non-specific symptoms. Urinary levels of methylmalonic acid and methylcitric acid (MCA) decreased after treatment. Regarding prognosis, among the 152 patients with NBS, 50.6% were healthy, 30.3% had neurocognitive impairment and/or movement disorders, and 13.8% died. Among the 209 patients without NBS, 15.3% were healthy, 45.9% had neurocognitive impairment and/or movement disorders, and 33.0% died. In total, 179 variants were detected in the MMUT gene, including 52 novel variations. The five most frequent variations were c.729_730insTT, c.1106G > A, c.323G > A, c.914T > C, and c.1663G > A. The c.1663G > A variation led to a milder phenotype and better prognosis.

- **Conclusion**: There is a wide spectrum of variations in the MMUT gene with several common variations.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of methylmalonic acidaemia and propionic acidaemia: First revision [^113XUzQj]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2021). Low credibility.

This update of the MMA and PA guidelines provides a digest of evaluated clinically relevant evidence published on these disorders. Based on the present evidence, 21 recommendations were formulated by a diverse panel of metabolic disease healthcare professionals. It should be noted, though, that the participants predominantly had a European/Mediterranean background. For the next revision, there is an intention to overcome this limitation and form a more heterogeneous panel.

Significant knowledge gaps remain regarding the optimal management of MMA and PA patients. While more and better-quality evidence is needed in the study of MMA and PA, the intention is to continue evaluating the literature regularly. This is to enable healthcare professionals working in the field to make well-informed decisions that are not based solely on dogmatic expert knowledge.

### Combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria: Exome sequencing reveals mutations in the ACSF3 gene in patients with a non-classic phenotype [^111n3LwP]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2011). Low credibility.

Combined Malonic and Methylmalonic Aciduria (CMAMMA) is a rare recessive inborn error of metabolism characterized by elevations of urine malonic acid (MA) and methylmalonic acid (MMA). Nearly all reported cases are caused by malonyl-CoA decarboxylase (MCD) deficiency. Most patients exhibit metabolic acidosis, developmental delay, seizures, and cardiomyopathy. Interestingly, CMAMMA has been described in symptomatic patients with normal MCD activity, suggesting heterogeneity in this disorder.

- **Methods and results**: We identified two probands with a non-classical CMAMMA variant through the Quebec newborn urine screening program. They both shared the biochemical phenotype of elevated MA and MMA; however, MMA excretion was higher than MA. Their clinical courses were benign, MYLCD gene sequencing showed normal results, and MCD activity, measured in one proband, was normal. Through exome sequencing of a single consanguineous proband, we identified a homozygous missense allele in the ACSF3 gene, which encodes an Acyl-CoA Synthetase (ACS) with an unknown substrate and function. The second proband was homozygous for a different ACSF3 missense allele. Both substitutions occurred in conserved residues and were identified in less than 0.5% of their respective ethnic control populations.

- **Conclusion**: These results suggest that ACSF3 is a candidate gene for non-classical CMAMMA observed in our patients. This study underscores the value of exome sequencing of a limited number of patients for the identification of novel disease genes.

### Genetic testing is necessary for correct diagnosis and treatment in patients with isolated methylmalonic aciduria: a case report [^112tQ2Eq]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Cbl responsive forms (typically CblA and mut-) are characterized by a later manifestation, most often provoked by an acute infection, or they develop gradually with symptoms of failure to thrive, hypotonus, and slow motor and mental development. Serious neurological complications and chronic kidney disease are less frequent. However, if Cbl treatment is underestimated, the disease may be complicated by renal failure. The in vivo responsiveness to vitamin B12 should be determined in all patients. The test most often used to assess cobalamin responsiveness is urinary methylmalonic acid excretion before and after administration of cobalamin. Methylmalonic acid concentrations in plasma and propionylcarnitine in dried blood are not commonly used. The test has to be done outside of a metabolic crisis, and a significant reduction (more than 50%) of typical metabolite production indicates sensitivity to Cbl treatment. Hydroxocobalamin (OH-Cbl) is the preferred drug for the test.

Here, in two case reports, we present the pitfalls of determining the iMMA type based on clinical course, the concentration of MMA in urine, and sensitivity to vitamin B12.

### Very long-term outcomes in 23 patients with cblA type methylmalonic acidemia [^115u9m1h]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2022). Low credibility.

CblA deficiency can present as a chronic disease (35% in this series), underlining the importance of measuring MMA in any case of unexplained chronic renal failure, intellectual disability, or growth delay. Less severe adult-onset forms are possible, even if extremely rare. Early B12 supplementation seems to partially protect from severe renal insufficiency and should be given to every patient with cblA deficiency.

### A novel small molecule approach for the treatment of propionic and methylmalonic acidemias [^115gP5vR]. Molecular Genetics and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Propionic acidemia (PA) and methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) are inborn errors of metabolism affecting the catabolism of valine, isoleucine, methionine, threonine, and odd-chain fatty acids. These are multi-organ disorders caused by the enzymatic deficiency of propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) or methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MUT), resulting in the accumulation of propionyl-coenzyme A (P-CoA) and methylmalonyl-CoA (M-CoA in MMA only). Primary metabolites of these CoA esters include 2-methylcitric acid (MCA), propionyl-carnitine (C3), and 3-hydroxypropionic acid, which are detectable in both PA and MMA, and methylmalonic acid, which is detectable in MMA patients only.

We deployed liver cell-based models that utilized PA and MMA patient-derived primary hepatocytes to validate a small molecule therapy for PA and MMA patients. The small molecule, HST5040, resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in the levels of P-CoA, M-CoA (in MMA), and the disease-relevant biomarkers C3, MCA, and methylmalonic acid (in MMA).

- **Proposed mechanism of action**: A putative working model of how HST5040 reduces P-CoA and its derived metabolites involves the conversion of HST5040 to HST5040-CoA, driving the redistribution of free and conjugated CoA pools. This results in the differential reduction of the aberrantly high P-CoA and M-CoA. The reduction of P-CoA and M-CoA, either by slowing production (due to increased demands on the free CoA (CoASH) pool) or enhancing clearance (to replenish the CoASH pool), results in a net decrease in the CoA-derived metabolites (C3, MCA, and MMA (MMA only)).

- **Clinical study**: A Phase 2 study in PA and MMA patients has been initiated to further investigate the clinical effectiveness of HST5040.

- **Growth**: Poor growth outcomes (weight, linear growth, and head circumference) are observed in MMA and PA patients, with a higher prevalence in MMA. Lower birthweights compared to the normal reference population are seen in newborns with MMA but not in PA.

	- Poor growth is more pronounced in mut 0 and cblB subtypes than cblA and mut − subtypes, with no reported difference between early and late‐onset patients. Linear growth appears more affected than weight gain, which can result in overweight and obesity in MMA and PA patients. A high percentage of fat mass is reported in MMA, particularly in mut 0 and cblB, and PA patients.

	- Failure to thrive is associated with intellectual disability and increased mortality in cobalamin non‐responsive MMA patients. In MMA, body length SD score decreased over time in patients with movement disorders compared to those without. Linear growth improves in liver-transplanted patients with MMA when protein intake is relaxed but not unrestricted.

Emergency regimens: Generally, it is unclear whether resting energy expenditure in MMA and PA is abnormal. There is no evidence in MMA and PA, but it may be considered that energy requirements might be lower in patients following a metabolic stroke with subsequent reduced mobility. Implementation of tube feeding can ensure adequate nutrition and energy intake in a selected group of MMA and PA patients.

Further, the role of upcoming therapies, such as mRNA therapy or other gene therapy approaches, on metabolic stability and other outcome parameters will need to be defined.

More dietary aspects are also described in the section on normal growth. In general, a diet low in natural protein aims at the reduction of precursor molecules funnelling into the defective pathway in MMA and PA. Practice of dietary management of MMA and PA patients aims at both metabolic stability and normal growth. It is based on adequate energy supply, avoidance of prolonged fasting, and reduced intake of precursor amino acids (methionine, threonine, valine, isoleucine) through a diet restricted in natural protein. An adequate provision of vitamins, minerals, trace minerals, and essential fatty acids for age is also required. The amount of natural protein must be assessed individually and must be based on clinical and biochemical monitoring. Breastfeeding is possible considering the total natural protein intake. However, there is insufficient data to define a detailed evidence‐based dietetic strategy in MMA and PA.

### Biomarkers for drug development in propionic and methylmalonic acidemias [^116Ko2k2]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2022). Low credibility.

**Conclusion and outlook**: It is highly complex to enroll and conduct a clinical trial of a new drug treatment for PA or MMA, due to the rarity, heterogeneity, mortality, and unpredictable outcomes associated with these inborn errors of metabolism. Selecting clinical endpoints for these trials is particularly challenging. Thus, there is a clear need to identify which biomarkers for PA/MMA could be surrogate endpoints to support the investigation of new therapies for these rare diseases.

### Acrodermatitis enteropathica-like eruption [^115mPmHw]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

- **Question 2**: What is the most specific test to confirm the diagnosis?

- **A. Skin biopsy**: Incorrect. A skin biopsy can be performed to eliminate differential diagnoses such as autoimmune bullous dermatosis (pemphigus and bullous pemphigoid) and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Because the histopathologic findings are not specific (psoriasiform pattern, confluent necrosis of keratinocytes, and intraepidermal vacuolization), a skin biopsy is not recommended.

- **B. Direct immunofluorescence**: Incorrect. Similar to a skin biopsy, direct immunofluorescence is an invasive technique, especially for newborns and infants. The skin sample can reveal a deposit of IgG or C3, which is not specific to this diagnosis.

- **C. Genetic analysis of the MUT gene mutation**: Correct. MMA occurs because of a defective conversion of methylmalonyl-CoA to succinyl-CoA in the absence of MUT. The search for the mutation analysis is performed in specialized centers (not available in our country). It is the gold standard diagnosis and can also help in the choice of treatment strategies. It can predict whether a patient will respond to vitamin B12 injections.

- **D. Dosage of urine organic acid (methylcitric acid and methylmalonic acid)**: Incorrect. The detection of urine organic acid using chromatography or mass spectrometry may lead to the diagnosis.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of methylmalonic acidaemia and propionic acidaemia: First revision [^111esVGq]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2021). Low credibility.

- **Literature search and evidence grading**: In the initial guidelines, the method to collect the evidence was based on SIGN. In the revised guidelines, the GRADE methodology was employed.

To gather the initial evidence base, a PubMed search was performed on September 29, 2019, with the following search terms: ("propionic acidemia" OR "propionic acidaemia" OR "propionic aciduria" OR "methylmalonic acidemia" OR "methylmalonic acidaemia" OR "methylmalonic aciduria" OR "propionic acidemias" OR "propionic acidaemias" OR "propionic acidurias" OR "methylmalonic acidemias" OR "methylmalonic acidaemias" OR "methylmalonic acidurias") AND ("1900/01/01"[Date-Publication]: "2019/09/05"[Date-Publication]) AND (English[Language]) NOT (animals[mh] NOT humans[mh]). This search yielded 1488 entries.

Articles were manually sorted to 194 clinical reports on patients with MMA and/or PA, excluding any lab-based studies and case reports with fewer than three patients. These were stratified into categories as shown in Figure S1. Case reports were considered in bulk for specific questions. Eight articles published past the cut-off date and seven articles cited within the initial clinical reports were deemed by the panel to be of specific importance, leading to a total of 209 articles. Articles were allocated to the categories 'high', 'moderate', and 'low' quality of evidence for a certain outcome by at least two panellists.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of methylmalonic acidaemia and propionic acidaemia: First revision [^1157DKF6]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2021). Low credibility.

Isolated methylmalonic acidaemia (MMA) and propionic acidaemia (PA) are rare inherited metabolic diseases. Six years ago, a detailed evaluation of the available evidence on diagnosis and management of these disorders was published for the first time. The article received considerable attention, illustrating the importance of an expert panel to evaluate and compile recommendations to guide rare disease patient care. Since that time, a growing body of evidence on transplant outcomes in MMA and PA patients and the use of precursor-free amino acid mixtures has allowed for updates to the guidelines.

In this article, we aim to incorporate this newly published knowledge and provide a revised version of the guidelines. The analysis was performed by a panel of multidisciplinary healthcare experts, who followed an updated guideline development methodology (GRADE). Hence, the full body of evidence up until autumn 2019 was re-evaluated, analyzed, and graded. As a result, 21 updated recommendations were compiled in a more concise paper with a focus on the existing evidence to enable well-informed decisions in the context of MMA and PA patient care.

### Genetic testing is necessary for correct diagnosis and treatment in patients with isolated methylmalonic aciduria: A case report [^111HppbB]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Methylmalonic aciduria (MMA) is one of the most common organic acidurias, with an incidence of 1:48,000 to 1:250,000. Methylmalonyl-CoA (MMCoA) accumulates in the body due to the disrupted degradation of valine, isoleucine, methionine, and threonine. Organic acids, particularly methylmalonate and methylcitrate, are formed from MMCoA in an alternative metabolic pathway, potentially causing metabolic acidosis, carnitine deficiency, and secondary hyperammonaemia. When methylmalonic acid accumulation is not accompanied by a significant elevation of homocysteine in plasma, it is classified as isolated methylmalonic aciduria (iMMA).

iMMA can be caused by pathogenic mutations in the MMUT gene (MIM#609058), encoding methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (mut type); the MCEE gene (MIM#608419), encoding methylmalonyl-CoA epimerase; or genes encoding enzymes involved in the intracellular metabolism of vitamin B12 (cobalamin, Cbl), which leads to the synthesis of the MMUT cofactor adenosylcobalamin (AdoCbl): MMAA, MMAB, and MMADHC (CblA, CblB, and CblD2 types, respectively). The MMAB gene (MIM#607568) encodes an adenosyltransferase that catalyzes the transfer of adenosine from ATP to cobalamin to generate AdoCbl. The MMAA gene (MIM#607481) encodes a protein responsible for proper AdoCbl gating and incorporation from MMAB to methylmalonyl-CoA mutase through a GTP-dependent interaction. If high doses of Cbl administration increase the activity of MMUT, the condition is described as Cbl-responsive iMMA. iMMA subtypes are diagnosed via enzyme assay analysis and/or molecular studies.

### Combined methylmalonic acidemia and homocystinuria, cblc type. I. Clinical presentations, diagnosis and management [^113HvGbq]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2012). Low credibility.

Combined methylmalonic acidemia and homocystinuria, cblC type, is an inborn error of intracellular cobalamin metabolism with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. It is stated to be the most common inherited disorder of cobalamin metabolism. This metabolic disease is caused by mutations in the MMACHC gene and results in impaired intracellular synthesis of adenosylcobalamin and methylcobalamin, which are cofactors for the methylmalonyl-CoA mutase and methionine synthase enzymes. Elevated methylmalonic acid and homocysteine, along with decreased methionine production, are the biochemical hallmarks of this disorder.

Awareness of the diverse clinical presentations associated with cblC disease is necessary to provide a timely diagnosis, guide the management of affected individuals, and establish a framework for future treatments of individuals detected through expanded newborn screening. This article reviews the biochemistry, clinical presentations, genotype-phenotype correlations, diagnosis, and management of cblC disease.

### Pulmonary hypertension in late-onset methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinemia: a case report [^116anCzo]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Methylmalonic aciduria and homocystinemia, cobalamin C (cblC), is an inherited disease of vitamin B12 metabolism with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations. cblC presenting with pulmonary hypertension (PH) as the leading symptom is rare and easily misdiagnosed due to limited awareness. Timely diagnosis is crucial due to the relentless progression without appropriate treatment.

- **Case presentation**: We reported a 12-year-old girl with a 3-year history of progressively reduced activity tolerance and a 3-month history of orthopnea. Metabolic testing revealed increased levels of plasma homocysteine and urine methylmalonic acid. cblC deficiency was subsequently confirmed by genetic testing. The patient was treated with hydroxocobalamin, betaine, folinic acid, and levocarnitine for cblC disease. Sildenafil, bosentan, spironolactone, and hydrochlorothiazide were administered for PH and right heart failure. At the 3-month follow-up, she had an apparent resolution of dyspnea and cyanosis. Metabolic abnormalities resolved with a decrease in plasma homocysteine and urine methylmalonic acid. A right heart catheterization showed reduced pulmonary pressure.

- **Conclusions**: This case emphasizes the importance of an early diagnosis and the initiation of treatment for cblC deficiency. Unexplained PH in children and young adults should prompt metabolic screening for differential diagnosis.

### Genetic testing is necessary for correct diagnosis and treatment in patients with isolated methylmalonic aciduria: A case report [^113HTRyJ]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Based on our experience, we suggest a scheme of the diagnostic procedure for the recognition of Cbl-sensitive forms of isolated methylmalonic aciduria (iMMA) (see Fig. 3). Fifty-two percent of cobalamin non-responsive and 67% of responsive methylmalonic aciduria (MMA) cases identified in newborn screening are still asymptomatic at 8 days of life and can be tested as recommended by Fowler et al. Patients who are not metabolically stable require prior stabilization; otherwise, they may not be suitable for the test at all. In such cases, genetic testing is helpful, particularly if enzymatic testing is not available.

- **Tentative protocol for recognition**: Asymptomatic patients or patients stable without vitamin B12 treatment can undergo the test of responsiveness according to Fowler et al. The sensitivity of unstable patients can be deduced from the results of genetic testing or enzymatic studies if available.

### Genetic testing is necessary for correct diagnosis and treatment in patients with isolated methylmalonic aciduria: a case report [^112eDzZX]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

During the years 2002–2020, seven patients with iMMA were diagnosed in our center. All were treated with diet, carnitine, and vitamins. Vitamin B12 treatment was modified according to the result of the in vivo Cbl sensitivity test.

Here, we report on two patients who manifested similarly in the first week of life with a severe metabolic crisis. Neurological symptomatology was accompanied by metabolic acidosis and hyperammonaemia above 1,000 μmol/L. Despite similar clinical signs in the manifestation period, the children differed in the course of the disease. Data were obtained retrospectively from the inpatient documentation and outpatient follow-up.

- **Patient 1**: The first patient with iMMA was considered as mut 0 type due to the severe clinical symptomatology. The boy was born at term with a birth weight of 2,900 g and a length of 49 cm. On the third postnatal day, he presented with vomiting, Kussmaul breathing, apathy, and hypotonus. Severe metabolic acidosis (pH < 7.2, base excess -23 mmol/L) with hyperammonaemia (260 μmol/L) was confirmed. The profile of organic acids in the urine indicated the diagnosis of MMA, with high excretion of methylmalonic acid and methylcitrate. He also had a slightly increased concentration of tHcy (24 μmol/L). The vitamin B12 levels in serum were not assessed as this measurement was not available at that time in our setting. The concentration of ammonia in the blood rose rapidly to 1,097 μmol/L, and the child required elimination treatment in addition to the carnitine and low-protein diet. Ammonia in plasma decreased from 1,097 to 6.
