## Question

can you start anabolic therapy for osteoporosis following a fracture?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether anabolic therapy for osteoporosis can be started after a fracture. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about fracture risk stratification to identify which patients warrant anabolic-first therapy. Then, I should verify the biological rationale and whether timing concerns differ between anabolic and antiresorptive drugs. Next, I will examine the clinical evidence on starting anabolic agents in the immediate post-fracture period. After that, I should review major guideline statements on who should receive anabolics and when. I will then compare this with data on antiresorptives to clarify sequencing. Finally, I need to consider practical issues like duration, safety, and follow-on therapy before formulating a clear clinical recommendation supported by evidence and guidelines.

> Let me first confirm how I should risk stratify the patient, because this dictates both urgency and choice of agent. I need to check whether the patient is simply high risk (osteoporosis by T-score or a single fragility fracture) or very high risk (recent severe vertebral fracture, multiple vertebral fractures, very low T-score with fracture, or fractures occurring on therapy), since guidelines reserve anabolic-first approaches for the very high-risk group and emphasize prompt initiation after any fragility fracture to prevent imminent refracture and mortality [^112aatoi] [^117Pdonw] [^1155iwLM].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about timing without distinguishing mechanisms. Antiresorptives reduce remodeling and theoretically could interfere with early callus remodeling, whereas anabolics stimulate osteoblast activity, matrix production, and callus formation; I should confirm that this mechanistic difference underpins different timing recommendations, with concern about early interference applying to antiresorptives but not to anabolics [^1166reiW] [^111uhphY] [^114idfXA].

> Next, I should review direct evidence that anabolic agents started early after fracture are safe and may even accelerate healing. Let me verify the details: in a prospective RCT of postmenopausal women with pelvic fractures, PTH 1–84 begun within 2 days of admission reduced mean healing time from 12.6 to 7.8 weeks and achieved a 100% healing rate at 8 weeks versus 9.1% in controls, with better function, which strongly suggests benefit when started immediately post-fracture [^111TsT5b]. In retrospective hip fracture cohorts, teriparatide started on the day of surgery shortened time to union and improved pain and function versus controls, again supporting very early initiation in the postoperative window, though I should acknowledge the lower level of evidence for these hip studies compared with the pelvic RCT [^111VW48w]. For stress fractures, a small pilot RCT in premenopausal women showed teriparatide increased bone formation markers and suggested faster healing, consistent with an anabolic effect, although the sample was small and the population differs from typical osteoporotic patients [^111TsT5b]. But wait, what if the agent is abaloparatide rather than teriparatide or PTH 1–84; I should double-check human fracture-healing data for abaloparatide, and the current literature notes a lack of human data on healing even though it increases BMD and reduces fractures in RCTs, so caution in extrapolating explicit healing acceleration is warranted for abaloparatide [^116VJvp9] [^1155iwLM].

> I need to verify whether guidelines endorse anabolic-first strategies after fracture and whether they require any delay. The Endocrine Society recommends teriparatide or abaloparatide for up to 2 years, and romosozumab for up to 1 year, in postmenopausal patients at very high fracture risk, a group that often includes those with recent severe or multiple vertebral fractures; these statements do not advise delaying initiation after a fracture and in fact emphasize prompt pharmacotherapy after a recent fracture [^114dfNJ7] [^112xDYHB] [^111tyf1K]. ACOG likewise recommends PTH analogs for up to 2 years in very high-risk patients, including those fracturing on antiresorptives or with significant bone loss, again without suggesting a waiting period after acute fracture [^116Fb4eM] [^116EWZVz]. Canadian 2023 guidelines advise consultation with an osteoporosis expert to consider anabolics for patients with recent severe or multiple vertebral fractures and T-score ≤ -2.5, implying early evaluation after fracture rather than deferral [^112aatoi] [^113ZjS7K]. The ACP 2024 guideline explicitly endorses considering teriparatide followed by a bisphosphonate for very high-risk postmenopausal patients, aligning with an anabolic-first sequence in this subgroup after fracture [^115TG2vB].

> I should also examine the comparator data on antiresorptives to avoid over- or under-caution about timing. Initially, I worried that early antiresorptive use could impair healing; wait, multiple RCTs and meta-analyses show that starting bisphosphonates within 1–2 weeks or within 4 weeks does not increase delayed union or prolong healing across hip, distal radius, proximal humerus, and spine procedures, though some preclinical data suggest starting at 1–2 weeks may optimize callus properties compared with the first week [^114z2Ta2] [^112tgN3Z] [^115qw4wM] [^1153o715]. For denosumab, a preplanned FREEDOM analysis found no signal for delayed healing even when given within a day of fracture, which reassures me that antiresorptives per se are not contraindicated early in most cases, though I still need to tailor choice by risk category and plan for sequencing and discontinuation issues [^115PAFf1]. Given that anabolics enhance, rather than suppress, early repair biology, it is reasonable — and supported by the studies above — to initiate teriparatide very early, even immediately postoperatively, in appropriately selected very high-risk patients after a fragility fracture [^111TsT5b] [^111VW48w] [^1155iwLM].

> Now, let me consider treatment sequencing because I need to ensure durable benefit after the anabolic window. I should confirm that after 12–24 months of teriparatide or abaloparatide, or after 12 months of romosozumab, transitioning to a potent antiresorptive maintains BMD gains and fracture risk reductions; this anabolic-first then antiresorptive strategy has become a key principle for very high-risk patients and is reflected in guideline updates and expert reviews [^114YSpfR] [^115pqRHS] [^114idfXA]. Hold on, I should also verify denosumab-specific caveats: if denosumab is used as the maintenance agent, it should not be stopped without subsequent antiresorptive coverage to avoid rebound bone loss and vertebral fractures, so planning the exit strategy up front is essential [^111Jyj6B].

> I will now examine practical and safety considerations that could influence immediate post-fracture starts. Cost and clinician familiarity can be barriers to prescribing anabolics, but these should not delay therapy in very high-risk patients when benefits are substantial and timely treatment reduces imminent refracture risk; I need to emphasize this because undertreatment after fracture remains widespread [^1166reiW] [^111qAZXf]. I should confirm duration limits: teriparatide and abaloparatide are generally limited to 2 years, and romosozumab to 1 year, after which antiresorptive maintenance is standard; concerns about osteosarcoma largely arise from animal data and have not been seen in humans at therapeutic exposure, but duration limits remain part of labeling and guideline practice [^114dfNJ7]. Monitoring and reassessment of fracture risk every 3–5 years, along with consideration of bisphosphonate holidays in appropriate patients, should be built into the long-term plan, recognizing that holiday concepts do not apply to denosumab due to rebound risk [^114T8vf9] [^111Jyj6B].

> Putting this together, I should state the clinical answer clearly: yes, anabolic therapy can be started following a fracture, and in properly selected very high-risk patients it can and often should be initiated very early — within days of fixation or diagnosis — because anabolics do not impair and may enhance fracture healing while rapidly reducing future fracture risk; patient selection, sequencing, and follow-up are critical to realize and sustain benefit [^111TsT5b] [^111VW48w] [^1155iwLM] [^114dfNJ7]. I should double-check that I have specified who qualifies and how to act: candidates include those with recent severe vertebral fracture, multiple vertebral fractures, or fractures on therapy with very low T-scores; start teriparatide or abaloparatide promptly for up to 2 years or romosozumab for 1 year, then transition to a potent antiresorptive, and consider specialist consultation to individualize the plan and navigate logistics; this reflects Endocrine Society, ACOG, CMAJ, and ACP guidance for very high-risk patients after fracture without recommending a delay in initiation [^112aatoi] [^113ZjS7K] [^116Fb4eM] [^115TG2vB] [^112xDYHB].

---

Yes, anabolic therapy for osteoporosis can begin following a fracture [^1155iwLM]; **early initiation** (within 1–2 weeks) is safe and may accelerate healing [^111TsT5b]. **Teriparatide and abaloparatide** are appropriate [^116EWZVz] for patients at very high fracture risk [^114dfNJ7], particularly those with recent severe or multiple vertebral fractures [^113ZjS7K]. **Romosozumab** is also an option for very high-risk patients, but monitor for cardiovascular risk [^112xDYHB]. After 12–24 months of anabolic therapy, **transition to an antiresorptive agent** [^114YSpfR] to maintain gains [^115pqRHS] and reduce future fracture risk.

---

## Clinical evidence supporting anabolic therapy after fracture

- **Teriparatide**: Clinical trials show teriparatide [^1155iwLM] accelerates fracture healing, increases callus formation, and improves functional outcomes in osteoporotic fractures. Early initiation (within 1–2 weeks) is safe and may shorten healing time [^111TsT5b].

- **Abaloparatide**: Similar to teriparatide, abaloparatide is effective [^116UTZpA] for patients at very high fracture risk [^114dfNJ7], including those with recent severe or multiple vertebral fractures [^113ZjS7K].

- **Romosozumab**: Romosozumab rapidly increases bone formation and reduces fracture risk [^112xDYHB] in very high-risk patients, but monitor for cardiovascular events.

---

## Timing of initiation

Early initiation is appropriate — anabolic therapy can start **within 1–2 weeks after fracture** [^1155iwLM] without delaying healing, and teriparatide may even accelerate healing [^111VW48w]. Clinical guidelines advise **prompt initiation** [^114dfNJ7] in patients at very high fracture risk [^115TG2vB], especially those with recent severe or multiple vertebral fractures [^113ZjS7K].

---

## Patient selection criteria

Anabolic therapy is recommended for patients at **very high fracture risk**, including:

- Recent severe vertebral fracture or multiple vertebral fractures [^113ZjS7K] with T-score ≤ -2.5.

- Continued fractures [^114dfNJ7] or significant bone loss despite antiresorptive therapy [^116EWZVz].

- Severe osteoporosis (low T-score < -2.5 with fractures) [^112xDYHB] or multiple vertebral fractures.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| Endocrine Society (2020) | Initiate teriparatide or abaloparatide [^114dfNJ7] for up to 2 years in very high-risk patients (e.g. severe or multiple vertebral fractures) |
| Canadian Osteoporosis Clinical Practice Guidelines (2023) | Consider anabolic therapy (teriparatide or romosozumab) [^113ZjS7K] in patients with recent severe vertebral fracture or multiple vertebral fractures with T-score ≤ -2.5 |
| American College of Physicians (2024) | Consider [^115TG2vB] teriparatide followed by bisphosphonate in postmenopausal women at very high fracture risk |

---

## Safety considerations and contraindications

- **Safety**: Anabolic therapy is generally safe after fracture [^1155iwLM]; teriparatide may accelerate healing [^111TsT5b].

- **Contraindications**: Avoid in patients with hypercalcemia, bone malignancies, or metabolic bone diseases other than osteoporosis [^114dfNJ7].

- **Monitoring**: Regularly monitor calcium levels and renal function during therapy [^113Kz4K2].

---

## Clinical outcomes and benefits

Anabolic therapy accelerates fracture healing [^1155iwLM], increases callus formation, and improves functional outcomes [^111TsT5b]. It significantly increases bone mineral density [^114dfNJ7], reducing future fracture risk [^112xDYHB], and has been associated with improved mobility and reduced pain [^111VW48w].

---

## Transition to antiresorptive therapy

Sequential therapy entails **transitioning to an antiresorptive agent** (e.g. bisphosphonate or denosumab) after 12–24 months of anabolic therapy [^114YSpfR] to maintain BMD gains [^115pqRHS] and reduce future fracture risk.

---

Anabolic therapy can be **initiated following a fracture** [^1155iwLM], and **early initiation** is safe and may benefit healing [^111TsT5b]. It is recommended for patients at very high fracture risk [^114dfNJ7], and after the anabolic course, **transition to antiresorptive therapy** [^114YSpfR] to maintain bone density and reduce future fracture risk.

### Timing of bisphosphonate initiation after fracture: What does the data really say [^1166reiW]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2020). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is often not clinically recognized until following a fracture occurs. Individuals with one fracture are at increased risk of future fractures. Prompt initiation of osteoporosis treatment following fracture is critical to reducing future fracture rates. Antiresorptives are the most widely used class of medications for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Many providers are hesitant to initiate antiresorptives in the acute post-fracture period due to concerns about interference with bone remodeling, which is necessary for successful fracture healing. This interference could cause increased rates of non-union, malunion, and refracture. Although these concerns should not extend to anabolic medications, physicians may also hesitate to initiate anabolic osteoporosis therapies due to high cost and/or lack of familiarity. This article aims to briefly review the available data and present a digestible narrative summary to familiarize practicing orthopaedic surgeons with the essential details of the published research on this topic.

The results of 20 clinical studies and key pre-clinical studies related to the effect of anti-resorptive medications for osteoporosis on fracture healing are summarized in the body of this narrative review.

While few level I studies have examined the impact of the timing of initiation of osteoporosis medications in the acute post-fracture period, the few that have been published do not support these concerns. Specifically, data from level I clinical trials indicate that initiating bisphosphonates as early as two weeks post-fracture does not negatively impact bone healing.

Effect of timing of therapy on fracture healing

Antiresorptive drugs among the different antiresorptive agents, studies in the literature on fracture healing are limited to only bisphosphonates and denosumab.

- **Bisphosphonates**: As the purpose of this review is to study the effect of timing of initiation of anti-osteoporotic drugs following a fracture, only the studies that evaluated the impact of initiation of bisphosphonate therapy in the acute post-fracture period (< 4 weeks) are discussed in this section. In most of the studies available in the literature, early initiation of bisphosphonate had been compared with either placebo or control. However, in a few studies, the patients were compared according to the time of initiation of bisphosphonate (early versus late). Alendronate, ZA, and risedronate were the most common bisphosphonates studied in the literature. These trials evaluated the effect of bisphosphonate therapy on all the common fracture sites including hip, distal arm, humerus, lower leg, as well as spinal surgeries.

### Guideline no. 422g: Menopause and osteoporosis [^114T8vf9]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for postmenopausal osteoporosis, particularly focusing on antiresorptive and anabolic therapy, the SOGC 2022 guidelines suggest initiating bisphosphonates. This treatment is recommended for patients with osteoporosis who are at an intermediate risk of fracture, ideally for up to 5 years, unless contraindicated.

Fracture risk should be re-evaluated after 3–5 years of treatment, at which point considering a drug holiday is advisable.

### Osteoporosis [^115kSiGJ]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2024). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a common systemic skeletal disorder resulting in bone fragility and increased fracture risk. Evidence-based screening strategies improve identification of patients who are most likely to benefit from drug treatment to prevent fractures. In addition, careful consideration of when pharmacotherapy should be started, choice of medication, and duration of treatment maximizes the benefits of fracture prevention while minimizing potential harms of long-term drug exposure.

- **Effect on lower extremity stress fracture**: In a pilot placebo-controlled study, Almirol et al. evaluated the short-term effects of teriparatide in premenopausal women with acute lower-extremity stress fractures. Patients were randomized to receive either 20 mcg/day of teriparatide (n = 6) or placebo (n = 7) for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks of treatment, bone biomarkers P1NP and OC increased more in the teriparatide group versus placebo (both p ≤ 0.01), resulting in a marked anabolic window (p ≤ 0.05). Thus, they concluded that teriparatide may help hasten fracture healing in premenopausal women with lower-extremity stress fractures.

- **Effect on pelvis fracture**: Peichl et al, in their prospective, randomized, controlled study, evaluated the effect of PTH 1–84 on pelvic fracture healing and functional outcome. Sixty-five postmenopausal women with pelvic fractures were analyzed. Twenty-one patients were started on a 100 mcg once-daily subcutaneous injection of PTH 1–84 within 2 days of admission. The control group comprised 44 patients. Fracture healing was assessed using computed tomography scans every fourth week until fracture healing was confirmed. Functional outcome was studied with the use of the 'Timed Up and Go' test and a visual analog scale for pain. In the treatment group, the mean time to fracture healing was 7.8 weeks compared with 12.6 weeks in the control group (p < 0.001). At 8 weeks, the healing rate was 100% in the treatment group compared with 9.1% in the control group (p < 0.001). Functional outcome was significantly improved in the treatment group.

Effect on hip fracture

In a retrospective observational study by Huang et al, 189 patients who underwent surgical interventions post-osteoporotic intertrochanteric fractures were enrolled and divided into three groups. Group 1 patients (n = 83) received only calcium and vitamin D postoperatively; Group 2 (n = 47) received teriparatide along with calcium and vitamin D; and Group 3 (n = 59) comprised patients who were already on alendronate prior to fracture and received teriparatide post-fracture. Those patients who received PTH (teriparatide) were started on a 20 mcg/day dose subcutaneously beginning on the day of surgery. Time to union was found to be significantly shorter in the teriparatide-treated groups [mean, 13.6, 12.3, and 10.6 weeks, respectively (p = 0.002)]. Health-related quality of life score SF-12 PCS and pain scores were significantly better in teriparatide-treated groups at 3 and 6 months. Thus, in this study, teriparatide proved to play an effective adjunctive role in the treatment of osteoporotic intertrochanteric fractures.

In yet another retrospective study, Huang et al. analyzed the outcomes of unstable pertrochanteric fractures in patients who underwent dynamic hip screw fixation. Teriparatide was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 20 mcg/day from the day of surgery. Fracture healing time was significantly shortened in the teriparatide-treated group (n = 29) compared to the control group (n = 44). The mean overall mobility scores were significantly better in the teriparatide group at 3 and 6 months (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively).

### Pharmacologic treatment of primary osteoporosis or low bone mass to prevent fractures in adults: A living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^1114EqWH]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

This guideline updates the 2017 American College of Physicians (ACP) recommendations on the pharmacologic treatment of primary osteoporosis or low bone mass to prevent fractures in adults.

- **Methods**: The ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee based these recommendations on an updated systematic review of evidence and graded them using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system.

- **Audience and patient population**: The audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, while the patient population encompasses adults with primary osteoporosis or low bone mass.

- **Recommendation 1a**: ACP recommends that clinicians use bisphosphonates for initial pharmacologic treatment to reduce the risk of fractures in postmenopausal females diagnosed with primary osteoporosis (strong recommendation; high-certainty evidence).

- **Recommendation 1b**: ACP suggests that clinicians use bisphosphonates for initial pharmacologic treatment to reduce the risk of fractures in males diagnosed with primary osteoporosis (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

- **Recommendation 2a**: ACP suggests that clinicians use the RANK ligand inhibitor (denosumab) as a second-line pharmacologic treatment to reduce the risk of fractures in postmenopausal females diagnosed with primary osteoporosis who have contraindications to or experience adverse effects of bisphosphonates (conditional recommendation; moderate-certainty evidence).

- **Recommendation 2b**: ACP suggests that clinicians use the RANK ligand inhibitor (denosumab) as a second-line pharmacologic treatment to reduce the risk of fractures.

Other Antiresorptives

- **RANK-L inhibitor (Denosumab)**: The RANK Ligand inhibitor denosumab (Prolia) inhibits osteoclast precursors from differentiating into mature osteoclasts, causing an antiresorptive effect. While there is less data on denosumab compared to bisphosphonates, it appears to have similar effects on bone healing. One study demonstrated increased callus formation, increased bone mineral density, and no delay in fracture healing in mice. The Fracture Reduction Evaluation of Denosumab in Osteoporosis Every 6 Months (FREEDOM) trial examined the rate of delayed unions following fractures among individuals taking denosumab for primary fracture prevention. It did not find an increase in delayed unions relative to placebo; however, the small number of cases of delayed unions (2 in the denosumab group, 4 in the placebo group) makes this result difficult to extrapolate.

- **Strontium ranelate**: Strontium ranelate has not been approved by the US FDA for use in osteoporosis but is used in Europe and elsewhere. Its mechanism is not well understood. It is postulated to have a mixed mechanism of action, including antiresorptive and anabolic mechanisms. Most available data suggest a predominantly antiresorptive mechanism. A 2007 study of tibia fracture healing in rats suggested strontium ranelate did not impact fracture healing in either direction. A 2016 study of fracture healing in rabbits treated with strontium ranelate raised concerns that it might interfere with the acute phase of fracture healing. A 2016 level I study investigating the use of strontium ranelate as an adjuvant…

### Timing of bisphosphonate initiation after fracture: What does the data really say [^1153o715]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2020). Low credibility.

The preponderance of available data suggests that all FDA-approved medications for osteoporosis are safe to initiate as early as 1–2 weeks into the acute post-fracture period. Bisphosphonates and denosumab, which share an antiresorptive mechanism of action, increase callus size and strength, decrease bone turnover, and do not affect the fracture healing rate. Pre-clinical data from a single study suggest that starting bisphosphonates 1–2 weeks post-fracture may produce greater callus strength than starting them within the first week. Insufficient clinical data is available to rigorously assess outcomes when bisphosphonates are initiated in the first week post-fracture. Data from the few available level I studies do not support concerns that initiating FDA-approved anti-osteoporosis pharmacotherapy in the acute post-fracture period will interfere with fracture healing. The conclusion we have drawn based on the best currently available evidence is that it is safe to start bisphosphonate therapy in the acute post-fracture period. These findings may change as additional studies are reported.

### Timing of bisphosphonate initiation after fracture: What does the data really say [^115qw4wM]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2020). Low credibility.

Osteoporotic fractures are estimated to affect 50% of women and 20% of men at some point in their lives. Osteoporosis is considered a silent disease because it is commonly not identified until one or more osteoporotic fractures have occurred. Due to this, the prompt initiation of screening and treatment for osteoporosis is increasingly recognized as part of the orthopaedic surgeon's scope of practice in elderly patients presenting with fractures. Given this emerging responsibility, it is important to combat misconceptions that may serve as barriers to initiating care in this population.

Perhaps the most common misconception regarding osteoporosis medications is that they cannot be initiated in the immediate post-fracture period without interfering with fracture healing. As this is often the first period in which osteoporosis is recognized and the only period when the patient has regular contact with the orthopaedic surgeon, combating this misconception can help to promote the prompt initiation of osteoporosis care by the orthopaedic surgeon or another professional in the orthopaedic department, such as a fracture liaison or bone health service. This article aims to briefly review the available data to rapidly familiarize practicing orthopaedic surgeons with the essential details of the published research on this topic. Because the vast majority of prescriptions for osteoporosis are for bisphosphonates, the majority of this review is dedicated to that class.

### Denosumab discontinuation in the clinic: Implications of rebound bone turnover and emerging strategies to prevent bone loss and fractures [^114EApCv]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2025). Low credibility.

Clinical considerations for denosumab initiation, discontinuation, and re-initiation:

- **Fracture risk**: Prior to initiating denosumab therapy, consider the fracture risk and the appropriateness for long-term antiresorptive therapy. Stopping denosumab and transitioning to other osteoporosis medications may be more appropriate in cases where long-term antiresorptive therapy is unlikely to be required.

- **Preclinical studies**: Additional preclinical studies examining the impact of denosumab treatment duration, the timing of sequential bisphosphonates, or the utility of repeated bisphosphonate doses combined with tapered denosumab withdrawal on rebound bone loss are important to define the optimal sequencing approach. It is also important to consider that factors involving other cells, and not just osteoclasts on active remodeling surfaces, may also be at play.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: An Endocrine Society guideline update [^111UFc4G]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of hip fractures, particularly in relation to osteoporosis, the ES 2020 guidelines recommend considering the initiation of tibolone to prevent vertebral and non-vertebral fractures in postmenopausal patients with osteoporosis at a high risk of fractures. The criteria for initiating tibolone include:

- **Below 60 years of age or less than 10 years past menopause**: Patients who are younger or not far beyond menopause may benefit from tibolone.
- **Low risk of DVT**: Patients should have a low risk of developing deep vein thrombosis.
- **When bisphosphonates or denosumab are not appropriate**: Consider tibolone when these other treatments are unsuitable.
- **Bothersome vasomotor symptoms**: Patients experiencing significant vasomotor symptoms.
- **Additional climacteric symptoms**: Presence of further menopausal symptoms.
- **No contraindications**: Ensure there are no contraindications for using tibolone.
- **No prior myocardial infarction or stroke or high risk for CVD**: Avoid tibolone in patients with a history of heart attacks, strokes, or a high cardiovascular disease risk.
- **No breast cancer**: Patients should not have a history of breast cancer.
- **Willingness to take tibolone**: Patients must be willing to adhere to tibolone therapy.

### The evolving role of anabolic therapy in the treatment of osteoporosis [^114idfXA]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

The purpose of this review is to address the evolving approach towards anabolic osteoporosis medication. Traditionally, many physicians have considered these medications as a last resort, only to be used after multiple fractures have already occurred. However, current thinking is evolving towards the proactive use of anabolic agents earlier in patients who are at high risk for fractures.

Recent data suggest that the three anabolic agents — teriparatide, abaloparatide, and romosozumab — reduce both nonvertebral and vertebral fractures more quickly and more effectively than the best antiresorptive treatments.

This review summarizes the evolving role of anabolic therapy in managing postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture. It provides an overview of pivotal clinical trial data for the three anabolic agents and describes studies that compare anabolic and antiresorptive medications. Additionally, it summarizes studies comparing treatment sequences with anabolic and antiresorptive treatments, and it defines high-risk patients who should be considered for initial treatment with anabolic medication.

### Timing of osteoporosis therapies following fracture: The current status [^116VJvp9]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) and PTH both bind to the same receptor (PTH1R) with similar bioactivity in their N-terminal region. Although Abaloparatide has been shown to increase BMD at various sites in RCT, data are lacking about its effect on fracture healing in humans.

- **Drug with anabolic and antiresorptive action**: Strontium ranelate has a dual function. It activates osteoblasts and increases bone formation, while also inhibiting osteoclasts and reducing bone absorption. Animal models have shown that strontium ranelate enhances callus strength in osteoporotic rats and could promote tibial fracture healing. However, an RCT conducted by Scaglione et al. in 40 patients older than 60 years with wrist fracture failed to show any benefit. Patients were randomly assigned into two groups: both groups (A and B) received calcium and vitamin D supplements. Group B additionally received strontium ranelate 2 g daily. In this study, strontium ranelate administered in the acute phase neither improved nor accelerated fracture healing.

### Should denosumab treatment for osteoporosis be continued indefinitely [^112RNbS9]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

The Swiss Association against Osteoporosis released a position statement in 2017. The position statement recommended continuing denosumab for up to 10 years in patients at high fracture risk, defined as having hip, spine, or multiple fractures before or during therapy; a femoral neck T-score < -2.5; age > 65 years and/or frequent falls; ongoing hormone ablative therapy (e.g. aromatase inhibition, androgen deprivation therapy); secondary osteoporosis; and continuing glucocorticoid therapy. In patients with a good treatment response (low fracture risk, increase of BMD to within age-adjusted range, cessation of aromatase inhibition), they advised mandatory sequential treatment with bisphosphonates (or SERM if bisphosphonate intolerant) for 12–24 months post-discontinuation of denosumab. They emphasized the importance of this, particularly in older women with prevalent vertebral fractures and in women without a history of long-term bisphosphonate use prior to denosumab.

The Endocrine Society 2019 suggests that in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis who are prescribed denosumab, the fracture risk should be reassessed after 5–10 years. The guidance is that women who remain at high risk of fracture should continue denosumab or receive other osteoporosis treatment. The high-risk group is defined as patients who have a prior spine or hip fracture, a BMD T-score of −2.5 or below at either the hip or spine, a 10-year hip fracture risk > 3%, or a risk of major osteoporotic fracture > 20%. According to the guideline, denosumab could then be stopped in low to moderate-risk patients.

Denosumab

In the phase III FREEDOM study (Fracture Reduction Evaluation of Denosumab in Osteoporosis Every Six Months), denosumab was shown to reduce the risk of vertebral, nonvertebral, and hip fractures over 3 years in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. In this trial, as scheduled, denosumab administration was not adjusted following a fracture, which provided an opportunity to evaluate the effect of denosumab on fracture healing. In a preplanned analysis of the FREEDOM trial, Adami et al. studied the effect of denosumab on fracture healing in patients presenting with nonvertebral fractures. A total of 667 subjects (303 in the denosumab group and 364 in the placebo group) experienced 851 nonvertebral fractures (386 in the denosumab group and 465 in the placebo group). Seven patients experienced delayed healing (two in the denosumab group and five in the placebo group). In this study, delayed healing or non-union was not observed in any subject who received denosumab within 6 weeks preceding or following the fracture. Fracture healing seemed to be unaffected in patients treated with denosumab, even when administered within a day of the fracture.

- **Anabolic drugs**: PTH and analogs

In this section, studies evaluating the effect of PTH and its analogs on fracture healing are reviewed. PTH (1–34) (teriparatide) and a PTHrP analog (abaloparatide) are the two licensed peptides that are currently approved. PTH (1–84) was used for several years in Europe but is not currently available for this indication.

### Timing of osteoporosis therapies following fracture: The current status [^111oKWF1]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

In another meta-analysis by Xue et al, eight RCTs involving 2508 patients were included. This meta-analysis compared studies involving early bisphosphonate therapy with control studies involving either placebo or no therapy (control studies) and those involving late bisphosphonate therapy (timing studies). The authors did not find any difference in fracture healing between the bisphosphonate and control groups in short-term (12 months) follow-up [four studies; RR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.98–1.02; p = 0.90]. A pooled analysis of the timing studies also did not show any significant difference in fracture healing time between early (1 month) bisphosphonate initiation following surgery [two studies; MD: −0.20, 95% CI: −1.03 to 0.63; p = 0.64]. Gao et al. also did not find any significant difference in fracture healing time between the bisphosphonate and the pooled comparator group [five studies; SMD: 0.17, 95% CI: −0.09 to 0.42; p = 0.21]. However, in their meta-analysis, studies with prior bisphosphonate use were analyzed together with studies where it had been initiated after surgery. Overall, the evidence from these studies suggests that the early (< 4 weeks) initiation of bisphosphonate following surgery is not associated with any significant prolongation of fracture healing time or any increase in non-union rate. There was no evidence of any detrimental effect on functional outcomes with early bisphosphonate use.

### Timing of bisphosphonate initiation after fracture: What does the data really say [^112tgN3Z]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2020). Low credibility.

Following a fracture, the timing of bisphosphonate initiation has been the subject of several research studies. Four level I clinical trials have explored its impact on fracture healing during the acute post-fracture period, specifically looking at rates of non-union.

A pre-specified subgroup analysis from the Health Outcomes and Reduced Incidence with Zoledronic Acid Once Yearly (HORIZON) ReFracture Trial revealed delayed union in 3% of the 2,127 patients randomized to either placebo or zoledronic acid. For context, nonunion rates for displaced femoral neck fractures range from 10–30%, while non-displaced fractures show a < 5% nonunion rate and intertrochanteric fractures a < 2% rate. No association was identified between zoledronic acid and delayed hip fracture healing (OR 1.17, 95% CI 0.72–1.90, p = 0.61). Furthermore, there was no observed temporal trend between the timing of zoledronic acid initiation and delayed healing when comparing individuals started on either zoledronic acid or placebo within 2 weeks of fracture, between 2 and 4 weeks, between 4 and 6 weeks, and more than 6 weeks post-fracture.

It is worth noting that only less than 5% of patients in the study (n = 102, N = 2,127) were started on either zoledronic acid or placebo within 2 weeks post-fracture. Due to this small sample size and the fact that approximately 3% of patients in any group experienced delayed unions, the study had limited statistical power to detect differences between those initiated on zoledronic acid within 2 weeks versus at later time points. Consequently, the lack of a statistically significant difference between individuals started on zoledronic acid during the specified periods must be interpreted with caution.

### Timing of osteoporosis therapies following fracture: The current status [^1155iwLM]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). High credibility.

In most patients, osteoporosis is diagnosed only after the occurrence of the first fragility fracture. It is of utmost importance to start osteoporosis medications immediately in these patients to prevent future fractures and also to reduce associated mortality and morbidity. There remains a hesitancy over initiating osteoporotic medications, specifically for antiresorptive agents like bisphosphonates, following an acute fracture due to concern over their effect on fracture healing.

The purpose of this review is to study the effect of the timing of initiation of different osteoporosis medications on healing after an acute fracture. Most of the human studies, including randomized control trials (RCTs), did not find any significant negative effect on fracture healing with early use of bisphosphonate after an acute fracture. Anabolic agents like teriparatide have shown either neutral or beneficial effects on fracture healing and thus can be started very early following any osteoporotic fracture. Although human studies on the early use of other osteoporosis medications like denosumab or strontium ranelate are very sparse in the literature, none of these medications have shown any evidence of delay in fracture healing.

To summarize, among the commonly used anti-osteoporosis agents, both bisphosphonates and teriparatide are safe to be initiated in the early acute post-fracture period. Moreover, teriparatide has shown some evidence in favor of reducing fracture healing time.

Anabolic drugs

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and PTH-related protein (PTHrP) are the anabolic agents used in the treatment of osteoporosis. Both act on the PTH1 receptor (PTHR1), leading to activation of downstream signaling pathways with the recruitment and proliferation of osteoprogenitors. The main effect of teriparatide [PTH(1–34)] is to stimulate bone formation without stimulating bone resorption. It promotes fracture healing by multiple mechanisms. It promotes proliferation and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, chondroprogenitors, and osteoprogenitors. It also leads to chondrocyte maturation, production of bone matrix proteins, and osteoclastogenesis. Teriparatide also enhances callus formation and remodeling by stimulating the synthesis of bone matrix protein and osteoclastogenesis.

Earlier studies have shown that intermittent administration of PTH (1–34) enhances the callus formation and mechanical strength of healing fractures in rats. Significant increases have been noted in the callus area and strength of rats treated with PTH. Kakar et al, using a mouse fracture healing model, have shown that PTH treatment induced the expression of chondrogenesis-related genes (Sox9, Sox5, Col2a1, and Col10) during the early phase of healing (days 5 and 7) and the expression of osteogenesis-related genes (Runx2 and Sp7) at days 10 and 14. Furthermore, the levels of unphosphorylated nuclear-localized β-catenin increased in osteogenic and chondrogenic cells in the callus of the PTH group, suggesting that the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway is one of the mechanisms responsible.

### Treat-to-target for osteoporosis: Is now the time [^111VUTnZ]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical practice guidelines identify patients at high risk for fracture who are likely to benefit from pharmacological therapy and suggest ways to monitor for its effectiveness. However, there is no clear guidance on when fracture risk has been reduced to an acceptably low level. Consequently, some patients at low risk for fracture may be treated longer than necessary, while others at high risk may have their treatment stopped when they could benefit from continuing or switching to a more potent therapeutic agent. The objective of this statement is to describe the potential clinical utility of developing a "treat-to-target" strategy for managing patients with osteoporosis.

- **Participants**: We recommend that a task force of clinicians, clinical investigators, and other stakeholders in the care of osteoporosis explore options, review evidence, and identify additional areas for investigation to establish osteoporosis treatment targets.

- **Evidence**: Data from large, prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled registration trials for currently available osteoporosis therapies should be analyzed for commonalities of correlations between easily measured endpoints and fracture risk.

- **Consensus process**: Osteoporosis experts, professional organizations, and patient care advocates should be involved in developing consensus on easily measurable osteoporosis treatment targets that are supported by the best available evidence and likely to be accepted by clinicians and patients.

### Should denosumab treatment for osteoporosis be continued indefinitely [^111p1UFF]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

Regardless of the underlying reason for denosumab discontinuation, whether it is a clinical decision or a patient factor, it is clear that many patients will ultimately discontinue therapy. It is important that evidence-based guidance is developed to minimize the risk of harm when discontinuing denosumab. An evidence gap exists regarding subsequent management; at the time of writing, the potential strategies to reduce the rebound effect of stopping denosumab have not been conclusively adjudicated. Suggested therapies include oral or intravenous bisphosphonates before or after denosumab, with or without reference to bone turnover markers, or SERM after denosumab.

### Established and forthcoming drugs for the treatment of osteoporosis [^116LR1FL]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of treatment in patients at high risk for fractures is to reduce the risk of a first or a subsequent fracture. New data are available on the antifracture effects and side effects of antiresorptive and osteoanabolic drugs, and new emerging therapies with new modes of action are on the horizon.

- **Recent findings**: Calcium and vitamin D intake should be sufficient, but not too high. Vertebral and nonvertebral (including hip fracture) prevention with antiresorptive drugs, such as bisphosphonates (alendronate, risedronate, and zoledronic acid) and denosumab, exceeds the risk of rare side effects such as atypical femur fracture and osteonecrosis of the jaw. Teriparatide is an osteoanabolic drug that improves quality of life in severe osteoporosis. Strontium ranelate decreases dynamic parameters of bone formation during the first year of treatment and could increase the risk of cardiovascular events in high-risk patients. Initiation of and adherence to fracture prevention drugs are still low. New potential developments in antiresorptive drugs include odanacatib, a selective inhibitor of cathepsin K, and, in osteoanabolic drugs, monoclonal antibodies against sclerostin.

These recent data indicate that fracture prevention with antiresorptives and teriparatide is effective with a reasonable safety profile. Odanacatib and antisclerostin are promising new drugs with new mechanisms of action, as they are able to disconnect the normal coupling between bone resorption and bone formation.

### After the initial fracture in postmenopausal women, where do subsequent fractures occur [^114cyxiC]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

Currently, there is a crisis of under-treatment of osteoporosis, with a marked decline in the prescribing of oral and intravenous bisphosphonates in the U.S. between 2007 and 2012. The rates of initiation of osteoporosis medication within 6 months of hospitalization for hip fracture have declined over the past 15 years from 10 to 3%. In 2017, only 3 in 10 fractures in the U.S. were followed up with bone density testing or treatment. The under-treatment of osteoporosis is particularly important because one half of all postmenopausal women will have an osteoporosis-related fracture during their lifetimes, and because osteoporotic fractures are associated with chronic pain and disability, loss of independence, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality. An estimated 12.3 million individuals older than 50 years in the United States have osteoporosis.

Some of the under-treatment of osteoporosis has been attributed to Food and Drug Administration announcements regarding potential risks of bisphosphonate therapy. Another source of under-treatment may be under-recognition that persons with prior fracture are at high risk for future fracture. Twenty percent of women experience a subsequent fracture within 10 years of an initial wrist fracture. However, detailed information from large prospective U.S. cohort studies regarding anatomical locations of subsequent fracture after initial fracture is lacking. This information would highlight the burden of potentially preventable fractures and inform the development and testing of targeted secondary prevention strategies.

Regarding the medical management of postmenopausal osteoporosis, particularly in relation to antiresorptive and anabolic therapy, the Endocrine Society's 2020 guidelines recommend not delaying or discontinuing denosumab without subsequent use of antiresorptive agents, such as bisphosphonates, hormone therapy, or selective estrogen receptor modulators. This approach is essential to prevent a rebound in bone turnover and to decrease the risk of rapid bone mineral density loss and subsequent increased risk of fracture.

### New anabolic therapies in osteoporosis [^1168z5FR]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2002). Low credibility.

While antiresorptive drugs have been the cornerstone of osteoporosis therapy, anabolic drugs represent an important new advance in the treatment of osteoporosis. By directly stimulating bone formation, anabolic agents might have greater potential than the antiresorptives to increase bone mass and decrease fractures. It is also possible that the combination of an antiresorptive agent with an anabolic agent could be more potent than either agent alone. Potential anabolic therapies for osteoporosis, including fluoride, growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor-I, strontium, and parathyroid hormone, are reviewed here. Of these, parathyroid hormone has clearly emerged as the most promising treatment at this time.

### Anabolic therapy and optimal treatment sequences for patients with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture [^115pqRHS]. Endocrine Practice (2020). Low credibility.

Provide an update regarding anabolic medications for osteoporosis, which are often considered a last resort for patients after multiple fractures have occurred and other medications have been administered.

- **Methods**: Literature review and discussion.

- **Results**: Recent pivotal trial data for anabolic agents and randomized trials comparing anabolic and antiresorptive medications suggest that three anabolic agents — teriparatide, abaloparatide, and romosozumab — reduce nonvertebral and vertebral fractures faster and to a greater extent than potent antiresorptive treatments. Furthermore, bone density accrual is maximized when patients are given anabolic agents first, followed by potent antiresorptive therapy. As total hip bone density during or after osteoporosis treatment has emerged as an excellent surrogate for future fracture risk, attaining a greater hip bone mineral density is a treatment goal for high-risk osteoporosis patients.

- **Conclusion**: This review defines the highest-risk patients and summarizes the rationale for the evolving role of anabolic therapy in managing postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture.

- **Abbreviations**: ACTIVE = Abaloparatide Comparator Trial in Vertebral Endpoints; ARCH = Active Controlled Fracture Study in Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis at High Risk; BMD = bone mineral density; FRAME = Fracture Study in Postmenopausal Women with Osteoporosis; FRAX = Fracture Risk Assessment Tool; PTH = parathyroid hormone; TBS = trabecular bone score.

### A before-and-after study of fracture risk reporting and osteoporosis treatment initiation [^115ZUgXr]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Several national organizations recommend that fracture risk assessment and osteoporotic treatment be based on estimated absolute 10-year fracture risk rather than bone mineral density (BMD) alone.

- **Objective**: To assess the changes in physician prescribing behavior after the introduction of absolute 10-year fracture risk reporting.

- **Design**: Before-and-after study.

- **Setting**: Manitoba, Canada, which has an integrated BMD program where tests are linkable to a population-based administrative health database repository.

- **Patients**: Women 50 years or older who were not receiving osteoporosis medication (2042 before and 3889 after the intervention).

- **Intervention**: Introduction of a system reporting absolute 10-year fracture risk along with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry results.

- **Measurements**: The proportion of untreated women who were prescribed osteoporosis medications in the year after the baseline BMD measurement.

- **Results**: Absolute fracture risk reporting reclassified more women (32.7%) into lower-risk categories than into higher-risk categories (10%). This effect was more prominent in women younger than 65 years. Fewer women per physician were prescribed osteoporosis drugs after the introduction of absolute fracture risk reporting. The absolute fracture risk reporting system was associated with an overall reduction in osteoporosis medications dispensed (adjusted absolute reduction: 9.0 percentage points [95% CI, 3.9 to 14.2 percentage points]; relative reduction: 21.3% [CI, 9.2% to 33.5%]; P < 0.001). The reduction was attributed to fewer drugs dispensed to women at low and moderate risk.

### Expert perspective: How, when, and why to potentially stop antiresorptive drugs in osteoporosis [^115Fnwwi]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is a chronic disease, and antiresorptive treatments are often continued for many years. Despite their established efficacy in reducing fracture risk, the most commonly used antiresorptive treatments, bisphosphonates and denosumab, have short- and long-term risks that, coupled with their benefits and other unique characteristics, influence consideration for at least periodic discontinuation. Bisphosphonates retain their effects even after discontinuation due to their prolonged skeletal retention, whereas denosumab discontinuation is associated with a rapid rebound in bone turnover and increased fracture risk. There is controversy about how, when, and why to potentially stop these agents. We discuss both permanent and temporary discontinuation of long-term treatment with bisphosphonates and denosumab. We focus on the reasons and timing for discontinuation as well as strategies to mitigate future fracture risk.

### Goal-directed treatment of osteoporosis [^116gbTDG]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2013). Low credibility.

Drug treatment for osteoporosis typically begins with an oral bisphosphonate, regardless of initial bone mineral density (BMD) or fracture risk, and decisions to continue or change treatment are often based on evidence of response to treatment based on changes in BMD, bone turnover markers, and occurrence of fractures. This pattern differs from preventive therapy for other conditions, such as hypertension, where treatment is based on achieving a goal. We propose that a goal be established to guide treatments to reduce fracture risk. The goal could be a certain risk of fracture or level of BMD.

Goal-directed treatment would individualize the initial choice of treatment based on the probability that alternatives would achieve the patient's goal. In contrast to changing treatments based on years of use or failure to respond, the patient's BMD and risk would be reassessed periodically, and decisions to stop or change treatment would be based on achieving or maximizing the chance of reaching an acceptable level of fracture risk or BMD. The acceptance of goal-directed treatment and its application to practice will require a consensus on a number of issues about goals, along with models of fracture risk while on treatment and probabilities of achieving goals. The result could be more rational and effective use of the expanding array of treatments for osteoporosis.

### Anabolic steroids for rehabilitation after hip fracture in older people [^1118RK4e]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Hip fracture occurs predominantly in older people, many of whom are frail and undernourished. After hip fracture surgery and rehabilitation, most patients experience a decline in mobility and function. Anabolic steroids, the synthetic derivatives of the male hormone testosterone, have been used in combination with exercise to improve muscle mass and strength in athletes. They may have similar effects on older people recovering from hip fractures.

- **Objectives**: To examine the effects (primarily in terms of functional outcome and adverse events) of anabolic steroids after surgical treatment of hip fracture in older people.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register (10 September 2013), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library, 2013 Issue 8), MEDLINE (1946 to August Week 4 2013), EMBASE (1974 to 2013 Week 36), trial registers, conference proceedings, and reference lists of relevant articles. The search was conducted in September 2013.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised controlled trials of anabolic steroids given after hip fracture surgery, in inpatient or outpatient settings, to improve physical functioning in older patients with hip fracture.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently selected trials based on predefined inclusion criteria, extracted data, and assessed each study's risk of bias. A third review author moderated disagreements. Only very limited pooling of data was possible. The primary outcomes were function (for example, independence).

### Timing of osteoporosis therapies following fracture: The current status [^114dkUAJ]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

The comparison among different osteoporosis therapies has been a focus of numerous studies available in the literature. These studies assess the effect of initiating anti-osteoporosis medications on acute fracture healing, predominantly evaluating either bisphosphonate or teriparatide. Similarly, published head-to-head trials between different anti-osteoporosis agents mostly compare these two medications. These comparative studies were conducted in patients with vertebral fractures, hip fractures, and patients undergoing lumbar fusion surgeries.

- **Radiographic healing and functional outcomes**: Teriparatide has been reported to perform better than bisphosphonates after acute vertebral fractures. However, in the trial by Kang et al, which evaluated teriparatide's effect in patients with vertebral fractures in comparison with other anti-osteoporotic drugs (either bisphosphonate or selective estrogen receptor modulator), no significant difference was reported. Although the early use of teriparatide has been shown to improve functional outcomes in comparison with risedronate after hip fracture, no significant difference in fracture healing time has been reported.

- **Bone fusion rate following spinal surgery**: In comparison with bisphosphonates, teriparatide has also been shown to improve bone fusion rate following spinal surgery (lumbar interbody fusion) in the majority but not in all studies.

A summary of the studies comparing the effect of different anti-osteoporotic agents following acute fracture is noted in the literature, although detailed tables are not provided here.

### Timing of bisphosphonate initiation after fracture: What does the data really say [^114z2Ta2]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2020). High credibility.

Kim et al. found that the mean time to fracture healing did not differ significantly between individuals starting risedronate 1 week after surgery, 1 month after surgery, or 3 months after surgery (p = 0.42) in a multicenter prospective trial investigating the timing of bisphosphonate initiation following internal fixation of intertrochanteric femur fractures in 90 patients. Gong et al. discovered no differences in clinical outcomes or radiographic parameters, including time to radiographic union, between individuals randomized to start bisphosphonates at 2 weeks versus 3 months post-fracture (6.7 vs. 6.8 weeks, p = 0.65) in a randomized controlled trial of 50 osteoporotic women aged 50 years and older undergoing volar locking plate fixation for distal radius fracture. Clinical outcomes were measured using wrist motion, grip strength, and the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score. Seo et al. found no delay in radiographic fracture union or clinical outcomes between those who started a bisphosphonate 2 weeks post-fracture compared to those who began a bisphosphonate 3 months post-fracture in a Level III retrospective review of 82 patients treated with locking plate fixation for proximal humerus fractures at a single institution. Clinical outcomes were measured using Constant and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) scores.

These studies collectively suggest that starting bisphosphonates 2 weeks or more following a fracture does not increase the rate of non-unions, mal-unions, or the time to radiographic union among patients who were not previously on a bisphosphonate.

### Anabolic androgenic steroids in orthopaedic surgery: Current concepts and clinical applications [^115j3uEG]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2022). Low credibility.

- **Hip fracture repair**: Hip fractures are a common cause of morbidity and mortality in older people. It is estimated that up to 50% of women and nearly 25% of men are at risk for an osteoporotic fracture in their lifetime. These patients tend to be frail and undernourished and may have poor mobility at baseline related to reduced muscle mass and strength. Despite surgery and rehabilitation, many patients experience a further decline in mobility and function, which has significant personal and societal costs. Early mobility has been found to be predictive of improved outcomes. As anabolic androgenic steroids (AASs) have had positive effects in treating other catabolic states, it is plausible that AASs may improve perioperative recovery and outcomes in the hip fracture population.

Although the overall quality of the evidence is low, a few small randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have provided mixed results on the effect of AAS on functional outcomes after hip fracture repair in older patients. In a pilot trial of 31 frail elderly females (mean age 82 years), Sloan et al. found no difference in the number of patients upgraded to a higher level of care, deaths, time to independent mobilization, or incidence of adverse events between patients who received postoperative nandrolone injections (weekly for up to 4 weeks) and those receiving placebo. A different study randomized 23 patients (aged > 60 years) recovering from hip fracture surgery, administered varied doses of AASs dependent on sex, and measured blood testosterone concentration. The authors noted no significant differences in knee extension strength between the AAS group.

### Antiresorptive and anabolic agents in the prevention and reversal of bone fragility [^115je5at]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2019). Low credibility.

Bone volume, microstructure, and its material composition are maintained by bone remodeling, a cellular activity carried out by bone multicellular units (BMUs). BMUs are focally transient teams of osteoclasts and osteoblasts that respectively resorb a volume of old bone and then deposit an equal volume of new bone at the same location. Around the time of menopause, bone remodeling becomes unbalanced and rapid, and an increased number of BMUs deposit less bone than they resorb, resulting in bone loss, a reduction in bone volume, and microstructural deterioration. Cortices become porous and thin, and trabeculae become thin, perforated, and disconnected, causing bone fragility.

Antiresorptive agents reduce fracture risk by reducing the rate of bone remodeling so that fewer BMUs are available to remodel bone. Bone fragility is not abolished by these drugs because existing microstructural deterioration is not reversed, unsuppressed remodeling continues producing microstructural deterioration, and unremodeled bone that becomes more mineralized can become brittle. Anabolic agents reduce fracture risk by stimulating new bone formation, which partly restores bone volume and microstructure.

To guide fracture prevention, this review provides an overview of the structural basis of bone fragility, the mechanisms of remodeling, and how anabolic and antiresorptive agents target remodeling defects.

### Should denosumab treatment for osteoporosis be continued indefinitely [^117NebJX]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Low credibility.

There is uncertainty as to what defines treatment failure in osteoporosis. No currently available therapy completely eliminates the risk of sustaining a fracture; thus, deciding to cease or switch away from denosumab due to the occurrence of an on-treatment fracture may not always be justified. A 2018 study by Kendler et al. assessed this issue based on the incidence rate of subsequent fractures in participants who sustained an "on-treatment fracture" while receiving either denosumab or placebo in the FREEDOM or extension study. The adjusted hazard ratio for subsequent fractures for the participants receiving denosumab compared with placebo was 0.59 (95% CI 0.43–0.81). This study offers evidence that sustaining a single fracture on denosumab is not necessarily indicative of treatment failure or inadequate response. The Endocrine Society suggests that treatment failure may be indicated by two or more on-treatment fractures, BMD loss greater than the least significant change over two years, or bone turnover marker suppression less than the least significant change.

- **Concerns regarding adverse events**: Given the concern about the possible association of denosumab with ONJ and AFF, some physicians are keen to minimize the time younger patients, in particular, are exposed to denosumab in an attempt to optimize the harm:benefit ratio. In the early days following approval of denosumab, the risk of abruptly stopping denosumab may not have been completely understood, and there was a lack of advice on the duration of treatment, likely leading to inappropriate cessation of treatment.

### Timing of bisphosphonate initiation after fracture: What does the data really say [^112yZy7h]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2020). Low credibility.

A level III retrospective review of Medicare insurance claims data found that the use of a bisphosphonate following a proximal humerus fracture was associated with an increased rate of surgical interventions for non-union, while bisphosphonate use before fracture was not. These results directly conflict with the above-reviewed results from clinical trials, which found use after fracture was not associated with delayed union while use prior to fracture was. It is unclear whether this discrepancy is related to the nature of the insurance claims data used, the fracture type investigated, the use of operative intervention for non-union as the clinical measure of delayed union, or another variable. In the absence of stronger evidence, we tend to trust the preponderance of direct level I, II, and III clinical studies over a single pharmacoepidemiologic study.

- **Biomechanical data**: A wide variety of animal biomechanical studies have been published examining the impact of bisphosphonates on fracture healing. Two narrative reviews by Larsson and Fazzalari, and Kates and Ackert-Bicknell focused on the biomechanical data for bisphosphonate use in the post-fracture setting. Both concluded that bisphosphonates (1) promote stronger callus formation, (2) delay remodeling, and (3) do not delay fracture healing. One notable study deserves special mention: In a rat fracture model, Amanat et al. found that callus strength was greater on post-mortem strength testing when bisphosphonates were initiated 1 to 2 weeks post-fracture rather than during the first week.

### Timing of osteoporosis therapies following fracture: The current status [^113b5NUw]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

In a meta-analysis evaluating the effect of early initiation of bisphosphonate therapy following surgery on fracture healing, 10 RCTs involving 2,888 patients were included. Among the bisphosphonates used were alendronate (four studies), ZA (three studies), risedronate (two studies), and etidronate (one study). Healing time was compared between the early initiation group, defined by bisphosphonate use within three months of surgery, and a comparator group. This comparator group included either patients without any drug therapy, those with late initiation of bisphosphonate therapy, or those given a placebo after three months of surgery.

In the included studies, patients either had no prior bisphosphonate exposure or underwent a significant washout period. The surgery sites were hip (six studies), distal radius (two studies), knee, and spine (one each). The pooled analysis did not show any significant difference in radiological healing time between the early bisphosphonate group and the comparator group [four studies; MD: 0.47, 95% CI: −2.75 to 3.69; p = 0.34]. Similarly, there was no significant difference in the risk of delayed or nonunion of fracture between the two groups (four studies; OR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.64–1.50; p = 0.30). The small sample size of the included studies, pooling of three types of control populations in the comparator group, and lack of fracture site-wise subgroup analysis were major limitations of this meta-analysis.

### Timing of bisphosphonate initiation after fracture: What does the data really say [^111qAZXf]. Geriatric Orthopaedic Surgery & Rehabilitation (2020). Low credibility.

Osteoporosis is often not clinically recognized until following a fracture occurs. Individuals who have one fracture are at increased risk of future fractures. Prompt initiation of osteoporosis treatment following a fracture is critical to reducing the rate of future fractures. Antiresorptives are the most widely used class of medications for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. Many providers hesitate to initiate antiresorptives in the acute post-fracture period due to concerns about interference with bone remodeling necessary for successful fracture healing, which could lead to increased rates of non-union, malunion, and refracture. While such concerns should not extend to anabolic medications, physicians may also hesitate to initiate anabolic osteoporosis therapies due to high cost and/or lack of familiarity. This article aims to briefly review the available data and present a digestible narrative summary to familiarize practicing orthopaedic surgeons with the essential details of the published research on this topic.

- **Results**: The results of 20 clinical studies and key pre-clinical studies related to the effect of anti-resorptive medications for osteoporosis on fracture healing are summarized in the body of this narrative review.

- **Discussion**: While few level I studies have examined the impact of timing of initiation of osteoporosis medications in the acute post-fracture period, the few that have been published do not support these concerns. Specifically, data from level I clinical trials indicate that initiating bisphosphonates as early as possible may be beneficial without compromising fracture healing.

### Pharmacological management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women: An Endocrine Society guideline update [^116ifJKm]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of postmenopausal osteoporosis, particularly with respect to antiresorptive and anabolic therapy, the ES 2020 guidelines recommend initiating raloxifene or bazedoxifene to reduce the risk of vertebral fractures in postmenopausal patients who are at high risk of fractures and have a low risk of DVT. This recommendation applies if bisphosphonates or denosumab are not appropriate or if there is a high risk of breast cancer.
