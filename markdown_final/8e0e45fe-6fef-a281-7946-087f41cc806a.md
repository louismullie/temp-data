## Question

Nonpharmaceutical treatments for urinary frequency in young male

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about nonpharmaceutical treatments for urinary frequency in a young male. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and likely etiologies in a young man. Then, I should verify which nonpharmacologic interventions have the strongest evidence base and how to apply them. Next, I will consider special issues like nocturia and pelvic floor mechanics. Finally, I will outline a practical, staged plan with monitoring and escalation triggers, and I will double-check where the evidence is weaker so I don't overstate benefits.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and likely causes in a young male with urinary frequency. In men under about 50, frequency is commonly driven by overactive bladder physiology, bladder outlet obstruction is less likely unless there is a known urethral stricture or congenital anomaly, and nocturia may reflect nocturnal polyuria, sleep disturbance, or behavioral factors rather than prostatic enlargement, so I should avoid anchoring on BPH too early here [^fe579695] [^a90512d4].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence for behavioral therapy as first-line. Contemporary guidelines consistently recommend behavioral therapies as first-line for OAB/frequency because they are effective, safe, and low cost; typical improvements in incontinence frequency range roughly 50–80% in broader OAB populations, and while many trials enroll women, subgroup and male-specific data show comparable efficacy in men, so I should not withhold these options from a young male patient [^f3a29347] [^d4f7b9dd] [^6a5f9e52].

> I will now examine bladder training and urge suppression strategies. Bladder training with delayed voiding and urge suppression techniques is recommended for all patients with OAB; in men, a randomized trial showed combined behavioral therapy reduced 24-hour voids by about 2.9–3.6 from a baseline near 11.8, with combined therapy outperforming drug therapy alone and performing similarly to behavioral therapy alone, reinforcing that behavioral therapy is effective and can be started first [^7068c7a0] [^6a5f9e52].

> Next, I should review pelvic floor muscle training. Hold on, I should verify whether this applies to men with frequency. Although much of the guideline language is written for women, the physiologic rationale and emerging male data support pelvic floor muscle training with confirmed contraction quality to suppress urgency and reduce frequency; in men with LUTS, self-management that includes pelvic floor strategies yields clinically meaningful IPSS reductions comparable to medications, so I should offer PFMT with instruction and, when possible, biofeedback or digital confirmation of technique [^333949f5] [^68058666].

> Let me consider fluid and dietary management. I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing from female-focused guidance. Reducing caffeine and total fluid load, especially evening fluids, can reduce frequency and urgency; a 25% reduction in fluid intake has been associated with improvements, and evening fluid restriction is a core nocturia strategy. I should tailor advice to the patient's baseline intake and monitor for constipation or dehydration if fluids are restricted too aggressively [^d4f7b9dd] [^ef765bea] [^9637445f].

> I should confirm the role of weight management and physical activity. While the strongest weight-loss evidence is in women, obesity is a recognized contributor to storage LUTS and weight loss is reasonable to recommend when BMI is elevated; additionally, regular physical activity can improve bladder control and overall LUTS burden, so I will incorporate these as adjuncts rather than primary therapies in a young, otherwise healthy male [^c0dc842c] [^cdfaa89b].

> But wait, what if nocturia is prominent. I need to check nocturia-specific behavioral measures. Conservative measures such as evening fluid restriction, bladder training, weight management, and addressing peripheral edema are first-line for nocturia; I should also screen for nocturnal polyuria and primary sleep disorders, and consider that desmopressin may reduce nocturnal voids in selected cases, though that crosses into pharmacotherapy and should be reserved after behavioral trials and risk assessment [^ef765bea] [^d0b47ecf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about combining therapies too early. I initially thought starting combined behavioral plus drug therapy might be best, but I should double-check the sequence data. In men, starting with behavioral therapy alone achieves substantial improvements, and while combined therapy can yield larger gains than drug alone, it does not clearly outperform behavioral alone; therefore, a stepped approach beginning with behavioral therapy is reasonable, with escalation if response is inadequate after a fair trial [^6a5f9e52] [^9e4c5d17].

> I need to ensure the practical plan is explicit and measurable. Let me outline a 12-week behavioral program: provide education on normal bladder function and set expectations; initiate a 3-day bladder diary to establish baseline; start bladder training with progressive delayed voiding and urge suppression; teach pelvic floor exercises with technique verification; implement fluid management with caffeine reduction and evening restriction; and set a 4–6 week check-in to reassess frequency, urgency, and nocturia, with escalation considered if there is less than about 50% improvement or if symptoms remain bothersome [^c97866eb] [^9e4c5d17] [^7068c7a0].

> Next, I should review what to do if behavioral therapy fails or is insufficient. If frequency persists beyond a 12-week behavioral trial, I should reconsider the differential, reassess fluid intake patterns, and consider adding pharmacotherapy such as a beta-3 agonist or antimuscarinic, recognizing that men and women have similar response rates to OAB medications; in refractory cases, neuromodulatory options like PTNS or sacral neuromodulation can be considered, though these are typically reserved after conservative and pharmacologic steps [^f21cc3d1] [^38442a05].

> Finally, I should double-check the strength of evidence and acknowledge limitations. Most high-quality guideline support for behavioral therapy is graded as strong or standard, even when derived from mixed-gender or female-predominant trials, and male-specific randomized data align with these conclusions; nonetheless, I will monitor closely for adherence and tailor techniques to the patient's goals and lifestyle to maximize benefit [^f3a29347] [^c97866eb] [^6a5f9e52].

Nonpharmaceutical treatments for urinary frequency in young men focus on **behavioral therapies** and **lifestyle changes** as first-line options [^f3a29347] [^c97866eb]. Bladder training with delayed voiding and urge suppression reduces frequency by ~25–30% [^6a5f9e52], and pelvic floor muscle training with biofeedback improves control and reduces urgency [^333949f5]. Fluid management (limiting evening intake, reducing caffeine/alcohol) [^ef765bea] [^9637445f], weight loss if overweight, and regular exercise also help [^c0dc842c]. These interventions are **safe, effective, and guideline-supported** [^f3a29347]; combine them for best results and escalate to pharmacotherapy only if needed [^6a5f9e52].

---

## Behavioral therapies

### Bladder training

- **Delayed voiding**: Gradually increase intervals between voids to stretch bladder capacity and reduce frequency [^7068c7a0].
- **Urge suppression**: Use distraction and pelvic floor contractions to suppress urgency [^6a5f9e52].
- **Scheduled voiding**: Void at fixed intervals to establish a routine and reduce urgency [^c97866eb].

---

### Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT)

Pelvic floor muscle training with biofeedback improves contraction quality and reduces frequency and urgency [^333949f5]; **regular, supervised practice** sustains benefits [^43392734].

---

## Lifestyle modifications

### Fluid and dietary management

- **Evening fluid restriction**: Limit fluids 2–3 hours before bedtime to reduce nocturia [^ef765bea].
- **Caffeine and alcohol reduction**: Decrease intake to lessen bladder irritation and frequency [^9637445f].
- **Bladder irritants**: Avoid acidic, spicy, and artificial sweeteners if they worsen symptoms [^notfound].

---

### Weight management and physical activity

Weight loss in overweight men reduces urinary frequency and urgency [^f73bcb53]; **regular physical activity** improves bladder control and lowers frequency [^cdfaa89b].

---

## Patient education and self-monitoring

Education on normal bladder function and bladder diaries improves adherence and outcomes [^8cee8813]; **self-monitoring** with diaries tracks progress and guides therapy [^cdfaa89b].

---

## Effectiveness and clinical evidence

| **Intervention** | **Evidence level** | **Effectiveness** |
|-|-|-|
| Bladder training | High | 25–30% reduction in frequency [^6a5f9e52] |
| Pelvic floor muscle training | Moderate | Significant reduction in frequency and urgency [^notfound] |
| Fluid management | Moderate | Reduces nocturia and daytime frequency [^ef765bea] |
| Weight loss | Moderate | Reduces frequency and urgency [^f73bcb53] |
| Patient education | High | Improves adherence and outcomes [^8cee8813] |

---

## Combination strategies

Combining behavioral therapies with lifestyle changes yields **greater improvements** than single interventions [^6a5f9e52]; a stepped approach — starting with behavioral therapy and adding lifestyle measures — is effective [^6a5f9e52].

---

## Patient adherence and engagement

Adherence is critical; **regular follow-up**, goal setting, and feedback improve persistence and outcomes [^b3f3bd7b].

---

## When to consider pharmacological therapy

Reserve pharmacotherapy for patients with **persistent symptoms** despite optimized nonpharmaceutical care, or when symptoms severely impair quality of life [^a90512d4].

---

Nonpharmaceutical treatments for urinary frequency in young men include behavioral therapies, lifestyle changes, and education, with **strong evidence** supporting their use as first-line therapy [^f3a29347]. Combining these strategies and ensuring adherence maximizes benefit, with pharmacotherapy reserved for refractory cases [^6a5f9e52].

### Evaluation of dysuria in adults | AAFP… [^eff42242]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

NONINFECTIOUS CAUSES In postmenopausal women, the marked reduction in endogenous estrogen can lead to lower urinary tract dysfunction. Atrophy, dryness, and, occasionally, inflammation of the vaginal epithelium contribute to urinary symptoms such as dysuria, frequency, and urgency. 14 Other noninfectious causes of dysuria in women include the urethral syndrome, 15 urethral trauma during sexual intercourse, and sensitivity to scented creams, sprays, soaps, or toilet paper. More than 50 percent of men over 70 years of age have clinical symptoms of BPH, and nearly 90 percent have microscopic evidence of prostatic hyperplasia. 16 In older men, a UTI may result from obstruction and increased postresidual volume. 17 However, dysuria may be caused by inflammation of the distended urethral mucosa without superimposed infection.

Obstruction and dysuria can also occur because of strictures caused by gonococcal urethritis or because of urethral instrumentation or surgery. It is important to inquire about the presence of other genitourinary symptoms. Dysuria is frequently accompanied by urinary frequency, hesitation, slowness, or urgency. Urinary frequency is most often caused by decreased bladder capacity or painful bladder distention. Other causes include overflow secondary to BPH, urethral pathology, and, rarely, a central or peripheral neurologic disorder. 19 In men, urethral discharge and dysuria are the most common symptoms of sexually transmitted urethritis. Information should also be obtained about the patient's sexual and general medical history. In sexually active patients, urethritis or vulvovaginitis can be a likely cause of dysuria. A history of sexually transmitted disease can point to urethral scarring or a current STD, especially in patients with high-risk sexual behaviors.

Patients who have diabetes mellitus may present with vulvovaginitis secondary to candidiasis. A digital rectal examination in men helps to assess the prostate gland. When prostatitis is suspected, gentle digital examination is advised because a vigorous examination can precipitate bacteremia and sepsis. An enlarged prostate can indicate an obstructive cause of dysuria; however, obstructive symptoms related to BPH can occur without palpable enlargement of the gland.

### Behavioral treatment options for urinary incontinence [^0c6aa415]. Gastroenterology (2004). Low credibility.

Behavioral treatments improve bladder control by changing the incontinent patient's behavior, especially his or her voiding habits, and by teaching skills for preventing urine loss. These treatments are effective for most outpatient men and women with stress, urge, or mixed incontinence. The average reduction in the frequency of incontinence ranges from 57% to 86%. In long-term care settings, treatment is generally more challenging and yields more modest results. The advantages of behavioral interventions include the absence of side-effects, patient comfort, and high levels of patient satisfaction. Although most patients who receive behavioral treatment achieve significant improvement, most are not completely dry. Thus, there is a need for research to explore ways to enhance the effectiveness of these conservative therapies. Combining behavioral treatment with other treatments may have additive effects. Research is also needed to understand better the mechanisms of therapeutic change, the best methods for teaching pelvic floor muscle control, the optimal exercise regimens, the predictors of outcome, and the efficacy of behavioral treatments in men. Although behavioral interventions are more accepted today than 20 years ago, they are still not widely available or integrated into most clinical practices, and we know little of how effective they will be in these settings. Thus, it will be important to develop and evaluate creative modes of delivery, such as group intervention (especially by nonphysician providers), in a variety of clinical settings.

### Does traditional pharmacotherapy augment behavioral modification in the treatment of nocturia? [^978a3473]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2021). Medium credibility.

Aims

To assess the efficacy of traditional first-line non-antidiuretic pharmacotherapy for nocturia in the real-world outpatient urology setting.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed voiding diaries from adult men treated for lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) at an outpatient urology clinic to identify pairs of voiding diaries with ≥ 1 nocturnal void at baseline and a corresponding follow-up diary completed within 1 year. We compared the odds of nocturia improvement (decrease of ≥ 1 nocturnal void) in patients started on LUTS pharmacotherapy versus behavioral modification alone.

Results

Two hundred and thirteen diary pairs from 93 patients were included. Fifty-seven diary pairs were identified from patients prescribed at least one LUTS drug on the initial visit and 156 diary pairs were identified from patients receiving behavioral modification alone. All standard voiding diary parameters were assessed, and only maximum voided volume differed at baseline (240ml [interquartile range: 200-330ml] vs. 280ml [200-400ml] with and without pharmacotherapy, respectively, p = 0.04). The odds of nocturia improvement did not significantly differ between pharmacotherapy and behavioral modification treatment groups (crude odds ratio [OR]: 1.16 [95% confidence interval: 0.63–2.16], p = 0.63; maximum voided volume [MVV]-adjusted OR: 1.19 [0.63–2.22], p = 0.59). In contrast, improvement in 24-h urinary frequency was more likely with pharmacotherapy versus behavioral modification alone (crude OR: 2.36 [1.22–4.56], p = 0.01; MVV-adjusted OR: 2.05 [1.05–4.01], p = 0.04). Results were consistent on subgroup analyses restricted to first diary pairs from each patient.

Conclusion

Despite improvement in 24-h voiding frequency, there was no evidence that adjunctive pharmacotherapy provided a benefit in the treatment of nocturia in men receiving behavioral counseling.

### Mixed urinary incontinence: are there effective treatments? [^33e778d4]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2023). Medium credibility.

7 CONCLUSION

Although standard treatments for UI benefit some patients, a large unmet medical need remains. Emerging pharmacological treatments seem to offer better risk‐benefit profiles than current options, but they are still mainly targeting UUI and overactive bladder and actively excluding patients with MUI from the development phase. While the development of safe and effective UUI treatments are a worthy endeavor, it does not address the current unmet need of patients with MUI, for whom adequate treatment remains a challenge.

### Nonsurgical management of urinary incontinence in women: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^d05288b3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

High-value care and clinical considerations — UI is a common and important health care problem in women that is underreported and underdiagnosed, and clinicians should take a detailed history and ask specific questions about UI, such as the time of onset, symptoms, and frequency. Clinicians should use nonpharmacologic management for UI, such as PFMT for stress UI, bladder training for urgency UI, and PFMT with bladder training for mixed UI, because they are effective, have few adverse effects, and are cheaper than pharmacologic therapies. Although pharmacologic therapy can improve UI and produce complete continence, many patients discontinue medication because of adverse effects. Vulnerable populations include women aged > 65 y, nursing home residents, and women receiving Medicare home care services, and at least one half of women with UI do not report the issue to their physician. Pharmacologic treatment should be based on harms, because most drugs are similarly efficacious. Identifying and managing conditions that may cause UI, such as urinary tract infections; metabolic disorder; excess fluid intake; and impaired mental conditions, such as delirium, are important, and clinicians should identify whether patients are receiving medications that may cause or worsen UI.

### Medical treatment of overactive bladder [^3b595d09]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Overactive bladder is a disruptive urinary condition composed of urgency, frequency, and nocturia, which affects a large proportion of men and women. Symptoms are often associated with a decreased quality of life. After optimizing behavioral strategies, pharmacologic intervention is the next consideration for treatment. Therapeutic agents consist primarily of antimuscarinic and β-agonist medications, as well as off-label use of antidepressants in some cases. These medications, although effective, can be associated with considerable adverse side effects. Combination therapies along with novel therapeutics and drug targets are under investigation.

Introduction

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) relate to the storage and voiding of urine (box 1). The severity and prevalence of LUTS in men increases with age (as much as 30% in men older than 65 years), with greater numbers likely to be affected as the population ages. LUTS can have a substantial impact on quality of life, with problematic LUTS referred to as bothersome. Men usually present with a range of LUTS that can relate to storage, voiding, or post-voiding urinary symptoms, and most men are initially assessed and managed by their general practitioner. LUTS in men can be caused by obstruction of the prostate or bladder dysfunction, or both, but symptoms can also be influenced by lifestyle factors. The UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence and the European Association of Urology recommend assessments to exclude serious medical conditions and to categorise and assess the impact of precise symptoms. Assessment of LUTS is time consuming, however, and the level undertaken in general practice varies.

Box 1
Lower urinary tract symptoms in men

Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in men can be caused by structural or functional abnormalities of the bladder, prostate gland, or urethra
Voiding LUTS are problems passing urine, such as hesitancy, slow urinary stream, and dribbling
Storage LUTS include urgency, increased urinary frequency, and nocturia. Storage LUTS can be due to increased urine volumes from high fluid intake or systemic conditions (cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, or endocrine)
Patients may experience one or more LUTS, and the severity of each symptom may not correlate with how much patients consider the symptoms to be bothersome
LUTS can be measured using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), with scores of 0–7 categorised as mild overall severity, 8–19 as moderate, and 20–35 as severe

### Managing lower urinary tract symptoms in men [^12894c42]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

Over one-quarter of men aged 40 years or over in the UK have lower urinary tract symptoms. These symptoms, which may seriously disrupt day-to-day activity, include frequency, urgency, hesitancy, reduced flow, dribbling, nocturia, incontinence and incomplete emptying of the bladder. Here, we review non-surgical measures that may help men with such symptoms.

AUA/SUFU Guideline on Overactive Bladder — efficacy by gender: Men and women experience overactive bladder (OAB) at similar rates, although men report urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) less frequently; in male patients, subgroup analyses of fesoterodine trials showed improvements in micturition rates and urgency episodes, and male-only arms of mirabegron studies indicated mirabegron was equally as efficacious as solifenacin for urinary frequency measured as 24-hour micturition episodes but not for urgency or UUI; in a randomized study enrolling male patients, mirabegron versus placebo for 12 weeks followed by a 14-week extension with mirabegron produced greater reductions in patient-reported outcomes over the initial 12 weeks, with no differences at the 26-week study endpoint; in female patients, vibegron sub-analyses showed similar magnitude of efficacy improvements versus the overall cohort, and pooled fesoterodine analyses showed improvements in UUI, micturition frequency, and urgency; a post-hoc pooled analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found no differences in clinical efficacy outcomes between men and women, and the Panel concluded currently available OAB pharmacotherapy agents are equally effective in men and women.

### Nocturia: etiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^8007a293]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2008). Low credibility.

Voiding at night, or nocturia, is a common reason for interrupted sleep in the adult population. The condition affects both men and women, with an incidence that increases dramatically with age. Nocturia has a negative impact on quality of life, affecting both morbidity and mortality. Effective diagnosis of the condition is dependent on a clear understanding of its underlying etiology. In general, the causes of nocturia fall into three categories: diurnal polyuria, nocturnal polyuria, and low bladder capacity. In some individuals, however, nocturnal polyuria and low bladder capacity may both contribute to the overall symptomatology of nocturia. Addressing any underlying conditions that contribute to nocturia is the first step in treating the condition. Lifestyle and behavioral changes may provide benefit in some individuals, but for many, the only option is pharmacotherapy. Antimuscarinic agents are first-line therapies for overactive bladder and are often used in the management of nocturia. Pharmacological and physicochemical differences between available antimuscarinic agents, however, translate into different safety and tolerability profiles, which may make some agents more suitable for use in certain populations, including the elderly. Careful selection of the most appropriate antimuscarinic medication is therefore central in optimizing treatment outcomes.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^38442a05]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) minimally invasive therapies — clinical principle and evidence — are positioned for patients not candidates for first-line approaches. Recommendation 23 states: Clinicians may offer minimally invasive procedures to patients who are unable or unwilling to undergo behavioral, non-invasive, or pharmacologic therapies. The guideline notes an empiric strategy where all patients are initially started on the least invasive, least expensive intervention ("first line therapy") and then, if ineffective, are progressed to more invasive and expensive options, adding that in this paradigm, individuals with OAB are not initially offered more invasive options and that long-term compliance with behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy is poor resulting in high rates of failure. Minimally invasive options including PTNS, implantable tibial nerve stimulation, BTX, and SNM have been associated with high success rates, durable efficacy, and excellent patient satisfaction in populations largely not responding to behavioral measures and medication management. For acupuncture, the evidence supporting acupuncture is uncertain as compared to no treatment or sham in OAB, though low-certainty evidence suggests similar improvements to pharmacotherapy in treatment naïve patients for reduction in UUI episodes, nocturia, and urinary frequency. Both laser and radiofrequency thermal therapies have not been well studied in OAB, and what evidence exists is of poor quality; thus these measures cannot be recommended at this time.

### Effectiveness of combined behavioral and drug therapy for overactive bladder symptoms in men: a randomized clinical trial [^6a5f9e52]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Importance

First-line behavioral and drug therapies for overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms in men are effective but not usually curative.

Objective

To determine whether combining behavioral and drug therapies improves outcomes compared with each therapy alone for OAB in men and to compare 3 sequences for implementing combined therapy.

Design, Setting, and Participants

In this 3-site, 2-stage, 3-arm randomized clinical trial, participants were randomized to 6 weeks of behavioral therapy alone, drug therapy alone, or combined therapy followed by step-up to 6 weeks of combined therapy for all groups. Participants were recruited from 3 outpatient clinics and included community-dwelling men 40 years or older with urinary urgency and 9 or more voids per 24 hours. Data were collected from July 2010 to July 2015 and analyzed from April 2016 to September 2019.

Interventions

Behavioral therapy consisted of pelvic floor muscle training with urge suppression strategies and delayed voiding. Drug therapy included an antimuscarinic (sustained-release tolterodine, 4 mg) plus an α-blocker (tamsulosin, 0.4 mg).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Seven-day bladder diaries completed before and after each 6-week treatment stage were used to calculate reduction in frequency of urination (primary outcome) and other symptoms (ie, urgency, urgency incontinence, and nocturia). Other secondary outcomes included validated patient global ratings of improvement and satisfaction, Overactive Bladder Questionnaire score, and International Prostate Symptom Score.

Results

Of the 204 included men, 133 (65.2%) were white, and the mean (SD) age was 64.1 (11.1) years. A total of 21 men discontinued treatment and 183 completed treatment. Mean (SD) voids per 24 hours decreased significantly in all 3 groups from baseline to 6-week follow-up (behavioral therapy: 11.7 [2.4] vs 8.8 [2.1]; change, 2.9 [2.4]; percentage change, 24.7%; P < .001; drug therapy: 11.8 [2.5] vs 10.3 [2.7]; change, 1.5 [2.3]; percentage change, 12.7%; P < .001; combined therapy: 11.8 [2.4] vs 8.2 [2.3]; change, 3.6 [2.1]; percentage change, 30.5%; P < .001). Intention-to-treat analyses indicated that posttreatment mean (SD) voiding frequencies were significantly lower in those receiving combined therapy compared with drug therapy alone (8.2 [2.3] vs 10.3 [2.7]; P < .001) but not significantly lower compared with those receiving behavioral therapy alone (8.2 [2.3] vs 8.8 [2.1]; P = 0.19) and were lower for behavioral therapy alone compared with drug therapy alone (8.8 [2.1] vs 10.3 [2.7]; P < .001). At 12-week follow-up, after all groups had received combined therapy, improvements in mean (SD) voids per 24 hours were also greatest for those receiving initial combined therapy compared with baseline (behavioral therapy: 11.7 [2.4] vs 8.0 [2.2]; change, 3.7 [2.3]; percentage change, 31.6%; P < .001; drug therapy: 11.8 [2.5] vs 8.6 [2.3]; change, 3.2 [2.5]; percentage change, 27.1%; P < .001; combined therapy: 11.8 [2.4] vs 8.0 [2.2]; change, 3.8 [2.1]; percentage change, 32.2%; P < .001), but there were no statistically significant group differences on primary or secondary measures.

Conclusions and Relevance

Combining behavioral and drug therapy yields greater improvements in OAB symptoms than drug therapy alone but not behavioral therapy alone. When using a stepped approach, it is reasonable to begin with behavioral therapy alone.

### Lower urinary tract symptoms in men: a review [^fe579695]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Up to 40% of men older than 50 years have lower urinary tract symptoms, including urinary urgency, nocturia, and weak urinary stream, due to disorders of the bladder and prostate. These symptoms negatively affect quality of life and may be associated with urinary retention, which can cause kidney insufficiency, bladder calculi, hematuria, and urinary tract infections.

Observations

In men, lower urinary tract symptoms can be caused by bladder outlet obstruction secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), an overactive bladder detrusor (a syndrome of urinary urgency and frequency), or both. Behavioral therapy, including pelvic floor physical therapy, timed voiding (voiding at specific intervals), and fluid restriction, can improve symptoms. Medications including α-blockers (such as tamsulosin), 5α-reductase inhibitors (such as finasteride), and phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors (such as tadalafil) improve lower urinary tract symptoms (mean improvement, 3–10 points on the International Prostate Symptom Score [IPSS], which ranges from 0–35, with higher scores indicating greater severity) and can prevent symptom worsening measured by increased IPSS greater than or equal to 4 points or development of secondary sequelae, such as urinary retention. Combination therapies are more effective than monotherapy. For example, α-blockade (eg, tamsulosin) combined with 5α-reductase inhibition (eg, finasteride) lowers progression risk to less than 10% compared with 10% to 15% with monotherapy. Treatment for overactive bladder detrusor, including anticholinergics (eg, trospium) and β3 agonists (eg, mirabegron), reduces voiding frequency by 2 to 4 times per day and reduces episodes of urinary incontinence by 10 to 20 times per week. Surgery (eg, transurethral resection of the prostate, holmium laser enucleation of the prostate) and minimally invasive surgery are highly effective for refractory or complicated cases of BPH, defined as persistent symptoms despite behavioral and pharmacologic therapy, and these therapies can improve IPSS by 10 to 15 points. Minimally invasive procedures, such as water vapor therapy (endoscopic injection of steam into BPH tissue) and prostatic urethral lift (endoscopic insertion of nonabsorbable suture implants that mechanically open the urethra), have lower complication rates of incontinence (0%-8%), erectile dysfunction (0%-3%), and retrograde ejaculation (0%-3%) but are associated with increased need for surgical retreatment (3.4%-21%) compared with transurethral resection of the prostate (5%) and holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (3.3%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Lower urinary tract symptoms, defined as urinary urgency, nocturia, or weak stream, are common among men and are usually caused by BPH, overactive bladder detrusor, or both. First-line therapy consists of behavioral intervention, such as pelvic floor physical therapy and timed voiding, as well as pharmacologic therapy, including α-adrenergic blockers (tamsulosin), 5α-reductase inhibitors (finasteride), phosphodiesterase inhibitors (tadalafil), anticholinergics (trospium), and β3 agonists (mirabegron).

### Optimizing nonsurgical treatments of overactive bladder in the United States [^b3f3bd7b]. Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Overactive bladder syndrome is a prevalent condition impacting quality of life, activities of daily living, work productivity, physical and psychological health, sleep, and sexuality. Published guideline recommendations and effective behavioral, pharmacologic, and neuromodulatory therapies exist; however, adherence can be poor. Clinicians have important roles educating patients, setting treatment expectations, and providing follow-up. Determining patient goals, routinely assessing and adjusting therapy, and combining treatment strategies may improve outcomes. We review the benefits and challenges of overactive bladder treatments and propose approaches to improve patient management, with the goals of initiating therapy earlier and achieving better patient satisfaction, functioning, and quality of life.

### Diagnosis and treatment of the overactive bladder [^d20dc678]. Urology (2003). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder syndrome (OAB) is a symptomatic diagnosis based on the presence of urgency, with or without urge incontinence, and usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia, in the absence of obvious pathologic or metabolic disease. Initial management of OAB requires an integrated approach using behavioral and pharmacologic methods. Patients should be educated about the functioning of the lower urinary tract system, fluid and dietary management, timed or prophylactic voiding and bladder training regimens, the keeping of micturition charts or bladder diaries, and pelvic floor exercises. Although the effectiveness of muscarinic receptor antagonists for the treatment of OAB has been shown, adverse effects, such as dry mouth, constipation, and blurred vision have somewhat limited their usefulness. Newer agents that are more bladder selective have been and continue to be developed. The concept of clinical effectiveness-a combination of efficacy, tolerability, and compliance-can be used to evaluate not only how well a drug works, but also the side-effect profile and bothersomeness and how likely patients are to continue treatment. Patients who do not respond to antimuscarinic treatment of OAB may do so because of a variety of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic reasons. Most cases of OAB are not cured, but rather the symptoms are reduced, with an associated improvement in the patients' quality of life. Patients who have failed behavioral and pharmacologic intervention may respond to neuromodulation and augmentation cystoplasty. Future approaches may include (1) other types of systemic pharmacologic therapy; (2) intravesical administration of drugs, including blockers of afferent input; (3) intradetrusor injection of botulinum toxin; (4) the use of tissue engineering to simplify augmentation cystoplasty; (5) genetic interventions to reverse neuroplasticity changes; and (6) combinations of these approaches.

### An evidence-based strategy for the conservative management of the male patient with incontinence [^f73bcb53]. Current Opinion in Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Incontinence is not an isolated symptom in men, but rather a component of a multifactorial problem that may include other lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Male urinary incontinence is often seen following prostate surgery and procedures, particularly prostate cancer surgery. Men with enlarged prostates experience overactive bladder symptoms of urgency and frequency. Despite these bothersome lower urinary tract problems in men, conservative treatment remains poorly investigated. This review will provide the current evidence-based strategies for the use of conservative management in men with urinary incontinence and other LUTS.

Recent Findings

Conservative treatment for urinary incontinence is an effective intervention and has been recommended by the evidence-based guidelines as the first-line intervention for LUTS. Despite this prevalence, the only population of men who continue to receive systematic consideration with respect to conservative management are those with postprostatectomy urinary symptoms. Although continence status gradually improves in the ensuing weeks and months, evidence-based research has shown that preoperative and early postoperative pelvic floor muscle training can speed the recovery of continence in the short and long term. Recent research has also shown that behavioral therapy combined with medication can improve the male symptom of nocturia. Lifestyle changes of weight loss in obese men with diabetes and LUTS and dietary modification has also been shown to be effective.

Summary

Although sparse, there are data to support conservative interventions as the first-line treatment in men with LUTS. There is a strong recommendation for implementing a pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) program before and after prostatectomy. Positive lifestyle changes such as weight loss in obese men and dietary modification can lessen urgency, nocturia, and incontinence. Despite this growing evidence on effectiveness, urologists rarely recommend conservative treatment to patients.

### Urinary urgency and frequency: what should a clinician do? [^e4de37eb]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Obstetrician-gynecologists often care for women with urinary symptoms of urgency and frequency. These symptoms are bothersome and treatable. Although it is rare that serious disease is causative, the clinician must be alert to ominous signs and physical findings. Most patients experience relief of their symptoms after a simple initial evaluation with appropriately directed treatment. A step-wise evaluation includes the directed history and physical, assessment of urinary habits, typically with a urinary diary, and occasionally an assessment of voiding efficiency, typically with a postvoid residual. Treatments may include myofascial therapy when trigger points are present on physical examination. Behavioral therapy and pharmaceuticals also play an important role. Persistent symptoms, hematuria, severe de novo postoperative symptoms, and ominous physical findings may warrant specialty consultation.

### Treatment patterns and associated symptom improvement during six months of care for overactive bladder: a prospective, observational study [^0b57b001]. Clinical Therapeutics (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Several pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions are available for the treatment of symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB). The relationship between type of initial intervention and subsequent symptom improvement and resource utilization has not been explored in detail.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to assess (1) the proportion of patients continuing with their initially prescribed treatment for OAB 3 and 6 months after the initial evaluation and (2) the relationship between actual treatment patterns, symptom improvement. and number of physician office visits.

Methods

A total of 31 physicians enrolled patients with OAB for this 6-month prospective, observational study. Baseline data on OAB symptom severity and OAB management strategies were obtained and initial treatment(s) were prescribed by physicians during a routine office visit. Follow-up data on symptom changes, treatment changes, number of physician office visits, and the frequency of absorbent pad use were collected via telephone interviews with patients 3 and 6 months after the initial visit. Stepwise logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between patient characteristics, prescription of medication, and symptom improvement.

Results

A total of 213 patients were enrolled; 122 (57.3%) and 100 (46.9%) patients provided follow-up data at the 3-month and 6-month assessments, respectively. The mean age was 61.2 years; 85.2% of patients were female, and 77.7% were white. OAB symptom improvement was significantly related to being prescribed medication (odds ratio [OR], 4.3; 95% CI, 1.8–9.9) and the mean number of daily leakage incidents at baseline (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.2–8.4). Although patients who were prescribed drugs at baseline tended to have fewer physician office visits and were less likely to be prescribed nondrug interventions than patients who were not treated initially with drugs, these differences were not statistically significant.

Conclusions

Pharmacologic treatment for symptoms of OAB appears to be associated with greater symptom improvement than nonpharmacologic treatment. Larger studies of experimental design are needed to determine whether patients treated with medication use fewer nondrug interventions and require fewer physician office visits than patients treated without medication.

### Diagnosis and treatment of overactive bladder (non-neurogenic) in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^8cee8813]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) — patient education (Guideline Statement 5): Clinicians should provide education to patients regarding normal lower urinary tract function, what is known about OAB, the benefits vs. risks/ burdens of the available treatment alternatives and the fact that acceptable symptom control may require trials of multiple therapeutic options before it is achieved (Clinical Principle). Prior to initiating treatment, the clinician should provide patient education regarding normal and abnormal bladder function, including voiding frequency and toileting behavior; explaining what is normal can help the patient understand how their condition diverges from normal and gives them a comparator (or goal) for judging their own progress in treatment. Education also empowers the patient to engage and participate in their treatment, which is essential when using interventions that rely on behavior change, and patients must understand that voiding is a behavior that can be managed and that successful OAB treatment requires a willing participant who is informed and engaged in the treatment process; patients should be informed that OAB is a symptom complex with a variable and chronic course.

### Interventions for treating people with symptoms of bladder pain syndrome: a network meta-analysis [^ed6fe6d9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Bladder pain syndrome (BPS), which includes the condition of interstitial cystitis, is a poorly understood clinical condition for which patients present with varying symptoms. Management of BPS is challenging for both patients and practitioners. At present, there is no universally accepted diagnosis and diverse causes have been proposed. This is reflected in wide-ranging treatment options, used alone or in combination, with limited evidence. A network meta-analysis (NMA) simultaneously comparing multiple treatments may help to determine the best treatment options for patients with BPS.

Objectives

To conduct a network meta-analysis to assess the effects of interventions for treating people with symptoms of bladder pain syndrome (BPS).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, in the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and handsearched journals and conference proceedings (searched 11 May 2018) and the reference lists of relevant articles. We conducted a further search on 5 June 2019, which yielded four small studies that were screened for eligibility but were not incorporated into the review.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of interventions for treating adults with BPS. All types of interventions (including conservative, pharmacological and surgical) were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed the risk of bias of included studies using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool. Primary outcomes were the number of people cured or improved, pain, frequency and nocturia. For each outcome, random-effects NMA models were fitted using WinBUGS 1.4. We monitored median odds ratios (ORs) for binary outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes with 95% credible intervals (Crls). We compared results of the NMA with direct evidence from pairwise meta-analysis of head-to-head trials. We used the CINeMA tool to assess the certainty of evidence for selected treatment categories.

Main Results

We included 81 RCTs involving 4674 people with a median of 38 participants (range 10 to 369) per RCT. Most trials compared treatment against control; few trials compared two active treatments. There were 65 different active treatments, and some comparisons were informed by direct evidence from only one trial. To simplify, treatments were grouped into 31 treatment categories by mode of action. Most studies were judged to have unclear or high risk of bias for most domains, particularly for selection and detection bias. Overall, the NMA suggested that six (proportion cured/improved), one (pain), one (frequency) and zero (nocturia) treatment categories were effective compared with control, but there was great uncertainty around estimates of effect. Due to the large number of intervention comparisons in this review, we focus on three interventions: antidepressants, pentosan polysulfate (PPS) and neuromuscular blockade. We selected these interventions on the basis that they are given 'strong recommendations' in the EAU Guidelines for management of BPS (EAU Guidelines 2019). We found very low-certainty evidence suggesting that antidepressants were associated with greater likelihood of cure or improvement compared with control (OR 5.91, 95% CrI 1.12 to 37.56), but it was uncertain whether they reduced pain (MD -1.27, 95% CrI -3.25 to 0.71; low-certainty evidence), daytime frequency (MD -2.41, 95% CrI -6.85 to 2.05; very low-certainty evidence) or nocturia (MD 0.01, 95% CrI -2.53 to 2.50; very low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence that PPS had improved cure/improvement rates (OR 0.14, 95% CrI 0.40 to 3.35; very low-certainty evidence) or reduced pain (MD 0.42, 95% CrI -1.04 to 1.91; low-certainty evidence), frequency (MD -0.37, 95% CrI -5.00 to 3.44; very low-certainty evidence) or nocturia (MD -1.20, 95% CrI -3.62 to 1.28; very low-certainty evidence). There was evidence that neuromuscular blockade resulted in greater cure or improvement (OR 5.80, 95% CrI 2.08 to 18.30) but no evidence that it improved pain (MD -0.33, 95% CrI -1.71 to 1.03), frequency (MD -0.91, 95% CrI -3.24, 1.29) or nocturia (MD -0.04, 95% CrI -1.35 to 1.27). The certainty of this evidence was always very low.

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain whether some treatments may be effective in treating patients with BPS because the certainty of evidence was generally low or very low. Data were available for a relatively large number of trials, but most had small sample sizes and effects of treatments often could not be estimated with precision. An NMA was successfully conducted, but limited numbers of small trials for each treatment category hampered our ability to fully exploit the advantages of this analysis. Larger, more focused trials are needed to improve the current evidence base.

### Electrical stimulation with non-implanted electrodes for urinary incontinence in men [^d917b553]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Electrical stimulation with non-implanted devices is used for patients with different types of urinary incontinence and symptoms of urgency, frequency and nocturia. The current review focused on electrical stimulation with non-implanted devices for the treatment of urinary incontinence in men.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness of electrical stimulation with non-implanted devices for men with stress, urgency or mixed urinary incontinence in comparison with no treatment, placebo treatment, or any other 'single' treatment. Additionally, the effectiveness of electrical stimulation with non-implanted devices in combination with another intervention was compared with the other intervention alone. Finally, the effectiveness of one method of electrical stimulation with non-implanted devices was compared with another method.

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, PreMEDLINE, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 21 January 2012). We also searched other electronic and non-electronic bibliographic databases and the reference lists of the included studies as well as contacting researchers in the field to identify other relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomized and quasi-randomized controlled trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed all the identified trials for eligibility. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool for determining bias. Disagreements were resolved by discussion, and a third review author was involved in the case of no consensus. Data were analysed using Cochrane methods.

Main Results

Six randomized controlled trials (five full papers and one abstract) were included. There was considerable variation in the interventions used, study protocols, types of electrical stimulation parameters and devices, study populations and outcome measures. In total 544 men were included, of whom 305 received some form of electrical stimulation, and 239 a control or comparator treatment. The trials were mostly small and generally there was not sufficient information to assess risk of bias; only two trials used secure methods of randomization. There was some evidence that electrical stimulation (ES) had a short-term effect in reducing incontinence compared with sham treatment (for example risk ratio (RR) at six months 0.38, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.87) but not at 12 months. Four trials evaluated the effect of adding PFMT to ES versus pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) alone or with biofeedback. There was no evidence of a statistically significant difference in the number of men with urinary incontinence at three months (146/239, 61% for combined treatment versus 98/156, 63% with PFMT alone; RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.06). However, there were more adverse effects with combined treatment (23/139, 17% versus 2/99, 2% with PFMT alone; RR 7.04, 95% CI 1.51 to 32.94) and quality of life also seemed better with PFMT alone. One small trial did not detect statistically significant differences between two methods of administration of transcutaneous electrical stimulation (anal versus perineal) but the quality of life score was lower (better) in the anal stimulation group.

Authors' Conclusions

There was some evidence that electrical stimulation enhanced the effect of PFMT in the short term but not after six months. There were, however, more adverse effects (pain or discomfort) with electrical stimulation.

### Desmopressin for treating nocturia in men [^d0b47ecf]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Nocturia is the bothersome symptom of awakening one or more times per night to void. Desmopressin is a commonly used medication for treating nocturia.

Objectives

To assess the effects of desmopressin as compared to other interventions in the treatment of nocturia in men.

Search Methods

We performed a comprehensive search of medical literature with no restrictions on the language of publication or publication status. The date of the latest search of all databases was August 2017.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized or quasi-randomized trials. Inclusion criteria were men with nocturia defined as one or more voids per night. Trials of children, adults with primary or secondary enuresis or underlying distinct disorders were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently classified studies and abstracted data from the included studies. We performed statistical analyses using a random-effects model and interpreted data according to the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

Main Results

We included 14 studies with 2966 randomized men across five comparisons. Desmopressin versus placebo: based on short-term follow-up (up to three months), desmopressin may have a similar effect on the number of nocturnal voids (mean difference (MD) -0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.94 to 0.01; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain about the effect of desmopressin on major adverse events at short-term follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% CI 0.10 to 9.03; very low-quality evidence). For intermediate-term follow-up (three to 12 months), desmopressin may reduce the number of nocturnal voids in an appreciable number of participants (MD -0.85, 95% CI -1.17 to -0.53; low-quality evidence). Desmopressin may result in little or no difference in major adverse events at intermediate-term follow-up (RR 3.05, 95% CI 0.13 to 73.39; low-quality evidence). We found no evidence on quality of life. Subgroup analyses suggest a larger effect with oral, higher-dose formulations of desmopressin and in men with documented nocturnal polyuria. Desmopressin versus behavior modification: there were no data regarding the effect on the number of nocturnal voids, quality of life, or major adverse events. Desmopressin versus alpha-blocker: based on short-term follow-up, desmopressin likely has a similar effect on the number of nocturnal voids (MD 0.30, 95% CI -0.20 to 0.80; moderate-quality evidence) and quality of life (MD 0.00, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.35; moderate-quality evidence). There were no major adverse events in either study group. Desmopressin plus alpha-blocker versus alpha-blocker alone: based on short-term follow-up, combination therapy likely results in a small, unimportant reduction in the number of nocturnal voids (MD -0.47, 95% CI -0.73 to -0.21; moderate-quality evidence) and quality of life (MD -0.29, 95% CI -0.51 to -0.07; moderate-quality evidence). The risk of major adverse events may be similar (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.32; low-quality evidence). Desmopressin plus alpha-blocker versus alpha-blocker plus an anticholinergic: based on short-term follow-up, combination therapy likely results in little or no difference in the number of nocturnal voids (MD -0.43, 95% CI -0.97 to 0.11; moderate-quality evidence). We found no evidence on quality of life. There were no major adverse events in either study group.

Authors' Conclusions

Desmopressin may reduce the number of nocturnal voids in an appreciable number of participants compared to placebo in intermediate-term (three to 12 months) follow-up without increase in major adverse events. We found no evidence to compare its effects to behavior modification. The effect on the number of nocturnal voids is likely similar to that of alpha-blockers short-term with very infrequent major adverse events. There appears to be no added benefit in the combined use of desmopressin with an alpha-blocker or an anticholinergic. The findings of this review were limited by short-term follow-up, study limitations, and imprecision.

### Do we need more patient-friendly treatment options for overactive bladder (OAB)? [^886f019e]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a stressful and disruptive disorder that causes millions of individuals to suffer from a decrease in their quality of life.OAB is defined as the presence of urinary urgency, usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia, with or without urge urinary incontinence, in the absence of urinary tract infection or other obvious pathology. Urgency is the complaint of a sudden, irresistible desire to pass urine. Frequency is the number of voids per day (> 7 voids per day). Nocturia is greater than 1 void per night. Urge incontinence is the involuntary leakage of urine associated with sudden compelling desire to void. To be diagnosed a combination of these symptoms must be present without a pathologic or metabolic component causing them. The national prevalence of OAB is 16.5%. The real number of individuals with OAB is most likely much larger. Many people living with OAB delay or do not seek medical attention, others are embarrassed and do not know how to talk to their health care providers about their symptoms, and others are often unaware that there are treatments available for OAB.

Patients are offered treatment following guidelines from the American Urological Association. First‐line treatments are physical therapy and behavioral therapies. These can be effective, but many patients are noncompliant. Second‐line treatment are medications. Anticholinergic and β‐3 agonist drugs show improvement rates of 70% to 80% but produce significant side effects (dry mouth, blurred vision, and cognitive decline) and can be cost‐prohibitive. Third‐line therapies include intradetrusor onabotullinumtoxin (Botox) injections, and neuromodulation. Botox produces a temporary improvement in up to 70% of cases; however, may cause urinary retention. Neuromodulation using percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) is up to 70% effective and has few side effects but requires frequent visits to the clinic. Also, because it lacks an objective method of nerve location and activation, PTNS' efficacy can be highly dependent on the clinician performing the procedure. Sacral nerve stimulation (SNS), has improvement rates of 70%–75%, but is invasiveand may require additional surgeries.

### Diagnosis and treatment of overactive bladder (non-neurogenic) in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^d4f7b9dd]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Overactive bladder behavioral therapies — Most patients experience significant symptom reductions and quality-of-life improvements; typical mean improvements range from 50% to 80% reduction in the frequency of incontinence. In obese women, a six-month behavioral weight loss intervention resulted in an 8.0% weight loss and reduced overall incontinence episodes per week by 47% (compared to 28% in the control group) and reduced urgency urinary incontinence episodes by 42% (compared to 26% in controls). One study reported that a 25% reduction in fluid intake reduced frequency and urgency, and reducing caffeine intake resulted in greater reductions in voiding frequency.

### The effects of drug and behavior therapy on urgency and voiding frequency [^81ef770d]. International Urogynecology Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction and Hypothesis

The objective of this study was to examine the effects of drug therapy alone and combined with behavioral therapy on urgency and 24-voiding frequency in women with urge-predominant incontinence and to identify predictors of change.

Methods

A planned analysis of data from a multi-site, randomized, controlled trial (N = 307). Bladder diaries were used to document voids, incontinence, and urgency severity.

Results

Urgency scores decreased significantly within both treatment groups, but changes did not differ between groups (p = 0.30). Improvement in urgency was associated with greater baseline urgency (p < 0.0001) and black ethnicity (p = 0.03). Voiding frequency increased with drug alone and decreased slightly with combined therapy (p = 0.009), and improvement was associated with combined treatment (p < 0.0001), higher baseline frequency (p < 0.0001), and lower baseline incontinence episode frequency (p = 0.001).

Conclusions

Although combined drug and behavioral therapy does not appear to improve urgency more than drug alone, it resulted in better outcomes on voiding frequency.

### Expert panel recommendations on lower urinary tract health of women across their life span [^02955911]. Journal of Women's Health (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion and Recommendations

After a day of topical presentations and discussions, the entire group discussed the most important research recommendations emerging from the Roundtable. A summary of the discussion specific to each area follows. The specific recommendations are listed in Table 3.

3

As a whole, the experts agreed that given the demonstrated effectiveness of incontinence treatment, research is needed on methods of increasing healthcare-seeking behavior for women with incontinence as well as implementation of successful prevention and treatment strategies that extend the reach of and optimize individual adherence to effective continence promotion programs. However, while many effective treatments are available, there exists a fundamental lack of understanding of pathophysiology underlying LUT dysfunction, resulting in nontargeted therapies. Physicians are only able to treat symptoms, but cannot correct pathophysiological causes. This shortcoming is combined with the generalized grouping of patients according to symptoms rather than disease mechanisms and results in relatively poor management and ineffective treatment.

Discussions concluded that it is important to understand normal function along with dysfunction to identify the root cause of a problem with the ultimate goal of preventing disease. Knowledge gaps in research have resulted from inadequate phenotype definitions of urinary dysfunction, insufficient data to determine what is normal and abnormal, and animal models that do not appropriately reflect human disease. Specific research recommendations address these limitations, including the need for clinicians to better define disease states so that animal models that more accurately reflect these human conditions and their etiology can be developed.

There is a need for better understanding of molecular, cellular, microbiome, and physiological mechanisms of normal and abnormal function and improved understanding of the role of biological sex in urological function. Additional work is needed to develop animal models that discriminate between different disease etiologies (in incontinence, for example) to properly assess the efficacy and safety of newly developed treatments. Last, a precise understanding of etiologic mechanisms can inform how to develop preventative treatment strategies in the future.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^7547c097]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) treatment research needs and medical therapy evidence gaps include that behavioral modifications and non-invasive treatments have been well studied and are relatively effective particularly in milder cases, yet they are time consuming or difficult to implement and adherence is limited by self-efficacy and discipline; individualized recommendations and phenotyping for biological and psychological attributes are proposed to personalize care. In medical therapy, many insurance providers mandate step therapy trialing one or more antimuscarinic medications before other therapies, evidence for advanced therapies in treatment-naive patients is scant, and a key unanswered question is the timepoint (in hours or days) after pharmacotherapy when maximum symptoms control is achieved; most studies assessed patient response at twelve weeks of follow-up even though steady state occurs within days.

### Anticholinergic drugs versus non-drug active therapies for non-neurogenic overactive bladder syndrome in adults [^e62d5307]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Overactive bladder syndrome is defined as urgency with or without urgency incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia. Pharmacotherapy with anticholinergic drugs is often the first line medical therapy, either alone or as an adjunct to various non-pharmacological therapies after conservative options such as reducing intake of caffeine drinks have been tried. Non-pharmacologic therapies consist of bladder training, pelvic floor muscle training with or without biofeedback, behavioural modification, electrical stimulation and surgical interventions.

Objectives

To compare the effects of anticholinergic drugs with various non-pharmacologic therapies for non-neurogenic overactive bladder syndrome in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register (searched 4 September 2012), which includes searches of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and MEDLINE, and the reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

All randomised or quasi-randomised, controlled trials of treatment with anticholinergic drugs for overactive bladder syndrome or urgency urinary incontinence in adults in which at least one management arm involved a non-drug therapy. Trials amongst patients with neurogenic bladder dysfunction were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors evaluated the trials for appropriateness for inclusion and risk of bias. Two authors were involved in the data extraction. Data extraction was based on predetermined criteria. Data analysis was based on standard statistical approaches used in Cochrane reviews.

Main Results

Twenty three trials were included with a total of 3685 participants, one was a cross-over trial and the other 22 were parallel group trials. The duration of follow up varied from two to 52 weeks. The trials were generally small and of poor methodological quality. During treatment, symptomatic improvement was more common amongst those participants on anticholinergic drugs compared with bladder training in seven small trials (73/174, 42% versus 98/172, 57% not improved: risk ratio 0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.61 to 0.91). Augmentation of bladder training with anticholinergics was also associated with more improvements than bladder training alone in three small trials (23/85, 27% versus 37/79, 47% not improved: risk ratio 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.38 to 0.88). However, it was less clear whether an anticholinergic combined with bladder training was better than the anticholinergic alone, in three trials (for example 74/296, 25% versus 95/306, 31% not improved: risk ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.62 to 1.04). The other information on whether combining behavioural modification strategies with an anticholinergic was better than the anticholinergic alone was scanty and inconclusive. Similarly, it was unclear whether these complex strategies alone were better than anticholinergics alone. In this review, seven small trials comparing an anticholinergic to various types of electrical stimulation modalities such as Intravaginal Electrical Stimulation (IES), transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), the Stoller Afferent Nerve Stimulation System (SANS) neuromodulation and percutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) were identified. Subjective improvement rates tended to favour the electrical stimulation group in three small trials (54% not improved with the anticholinergic versus 28/86, 33% with electrical stimulation: risk ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 2.34). However, this was statistically significant only for one type of stimulation, percutaneous posterior tibial nerve stimulation (risk ratio 2.21, 95% confidence interval 1.13 to 4.33), and was not supported by significant differences in improvement, urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia, incontinence episodes or quality of life. The most commonly reported adverse effect among anticholinergics was dry mouth, although this did not necessarily result in withdrawal from treatment. For all comparisons there were too few data to compare symptoms or side effects after treatment had ended. However, it is unlikely that the effects of anticholinergics persist after stopping treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

The use of anticholinergic drugs in the management of overactive bladder syndrome is well established when compared to placebo treatment. During initial treatment of overactive bladder syndrome there was more symptomatic improvement when (a) anticholinergics were compared with bladder training alone, and (b) anticholinergics combined with bladder training were compared with bladder training alone. Limited evidence from small trials might suggest electrical stimulation is a better option in patients who are refractory to anticholinergic therapy, but more evidence comparing individual types of electrostimulation to the most effective types of anticholinergics is required to establish this. These results should be viewed with caution in view of the different classes and varying doses of individual anticholinergics used in this review. Anticholinergics had well recognised side effects, such as dry mouth.

### Anticholinergic drugs versus non-drug active therapies for overactive bladder syndrome in adults [^ab9b6cff]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Overactive Bladder Syndrome (OAB) is defined as urgency, with or without urgency incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia. Pharmacotherapy with anticholinergic drugs is often the first line medical therapy, either alone or as an adjunct to various non-pharmacological therapies. The commonest non-pharmacologic therapies are: bladder training, pelvic floor muscle training with or without biofeedback and electric stimulation to affect detrusor muscle activity.

Objectives

To compare the effects of various anticholinergic drugs with various non-pharmacologic therapies for idiopathic overactive bladder syndrome in adults.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register (searched 29 November 2005), The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (January 1966 to September 2004), PREMEDLINE, Dissertation Abstracts and the reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

All randomised, or quasi-randomised, controlled trials of treatment with anticholinergic drugs for overactive bladder syndrome or urge urinary incontinence in adults, in which at least one management arm involved a non-drug new therapy. Trials amongst patients with neuropathic bladder dysfunction were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors evaluated the trials for appropriateness for inclusion and methodological quality. Three authors were involved in the data extraction. Data extracted was based on predetermined criteria. Data analysis was based on standard statistical approaches used in Cochrane reviews.

Main Results

Thirteen trials with 1770 participants were included; all were designed as parallel groups except for one cross-over trial. Trial groups were well matched for baseline characteristics in all trials. Treatment duration was 3 to 12 weeks, with one trial carrying out a follow-up analysis at 24 weeks after starting treatment. During treatment, symptomatic improvement was more common amongst those on anticholinergic drugs compared with bladder training (RR 0.73; 95% CI 0.59 to 0.90). Combination of anticholinergics with bladder training was also associated with more improvement than bladder training alone but with wide confidence intervals (RR 0.55; 95% 0.32 to 0.93). Similarly, the limited data favoured a combination of anticholinergics with bladder training compared with anticholinergics during treatment but the difference was not statistically significant (RR for improvement 0.81; 95% CI 0.61 to 1.06). For all comparisons, there were too few data to compare symptoms after treatment had ended. Adverse effects, such as dry mouth, were reported by around a third of those taking anticholinergics.

Authors' Conclusions

The use of anticholinergic drugs in the management of OAB is well established. During initial treatment there was more symptomatic improvement when (a) anticholinergics were compared with bladder training alone, and (b) anticholinergics combined with bladder training were compared with each modality alone. Anticholinergics have well recognised side effects, such as dry mouth. There were too few data to assess whether or not effects are sustained after stopping treatment.

### Nonsurgical management of urinary incontinence in women: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^e71f7fa1]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Urinary incontinence in women — epidemiology, risk factors, types, and treatment goals: Urinary incontinence (UI), the involuntary loss of urine, has a prevalence of approximately 25% in young women (aged 14 to 21 years), 44% to 57% in middle-aged and postmenopausal women (aged 40 to 60 years), and 75% in elderly women (aged ≥ 75 years), and at least half of incontinent women do not report the issue to their physicians. Risk factors for UI include pregnancy, pelvic floor trauma after vaginal delivery, menopause, hysterectomy, obesity, urinary tract infection, functional and/or cognitive impairment, chronic cough, and constipation. Urinary incontinence also contributes to high medical spending — approximately $19.5 billion was spent in the United States in 2004 — and it accounts for 6% of nursing home admissions for elderly women, costing approximately $3 billion. The 2 types of UI are based on the dysfunctional mechanism: stress and urgency; stress UI is related to urethral sphincter failure associated with intra-abdominal pressure and results in the inability to retain urine when laughing, coughing, or sneezing, whereas urgency UI is the involuntary loss of urine associated with a sudden and compelling urge to void; mixed UI is a combination of stress and urgency. Overactive bladder is a constellation of symptoms that includes urinary urgency (with or without UI), usually accompanied by frequency, and nocturia. The primary goal of treatment is to achieve or improve continence, and clinically successful treatment has been defined as that which reduces the frequency of UI episodes by at least 50%; nonsurgical treatments addressed in this guideline include lifestyle changes, pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), and various approved drugs.

### Lifestyle interventions for the treatment of urinary incontinence in adults [^6cc2afb3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Low cost, non-invasive alterations in lifestyle are frequently recommended by healthcare professionals or those presenting with incontinence. However, such recommendations are rarely based on good evidence.

Objectives

The objective of the review was to determine the effectiveness of specific lifestyle interventions (i.e. weight loss; dietary changes; fluid intake; reduction in caffeinated, carbonated and alcoholic drinks; avoidance of constipation; stopping smoking; and physical activity) in the management of adult urinary incontinence.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and MEDLINE in process, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 3 July 2013), and the reference lists of relevant articles. We incorporated the results of these searches fully in the review. We undertook an updated search of the Specialised Register, which now includes searches of ClinicalTrials.gov and WHO ICTRP, on 27 October 2014; potentially eligible studies from this search are currently awaiting classification.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi-randomised studies of community-based lifestyle interventions compared with no treatment, other conservative therapies, or pharmacological interventions for the treatment of urinary incontinence in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted data. We collected information on adverse effects from the trials. Data were combined in a meta-analysis when appropriate. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 11 trials in the review, involving a total of 5974 participants. Four trials involving 4701 women compared weight loss programmes with a control intervention. Low quality evidence from one trial suggested that more women following weight loss programmes reported improvement in symptoms of incontinence at six months (163/214 (76%) versus 49/90 (54%), risk ratio (RR) 1.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14 to 1.71), and this effect was sustained at 18 months (N = 291, 75% versus 62%, RR not estimable, reported P value 0.02). No data were available for self-reported cure and quality of life. One of the weight loss trials involving 1296 women reported very low quality evidence for a reduction in weekly urinary incontinence a mean of 2.8 years after following a lifestyle weight loss intervention that had been compared with a pharmacological weight loss intervention. Three trials involving 181 women and 11 men compared change in fluid intake with no change. Limited, very low quality evidence suggested that symptom-specific quality of life scores improved when fluid intake was reduced, although some people reported headaches, constipation or thirst. A further three trials involving 160 women and nine men compared reduction in caffeinated drinks with no change, and one trial involving 42 women compared a soy-rich diet with soy-free diet. However, it was not possible to reach any conclusions about the effects of these changes, due to methodological limitations, that resulted in very low quality evidence. Adverse effects appeared relatively uncommon for all interventions studied. All included studies had a high or unclear risk of bias across all bias parameters, but most notably for allocation concealment. The main factors for our downgrading of the evidence were risk of bias, indirect evidence (less than 12 months of follow-up; and not all participants having confirmed urinary incontinence at baseline in some studies), and imprecise results with wide confidence intervals. Other interventions such as reduction in consumption of sweetened fizzy or diet drinks; reduction in alcohol consumption; avoiding constipation; smoking cessation; restricting strenuous physical forces; or reducing high levels of, or increasing low levels of, physical activity, could not be assessed in this review, as no evidence from randomized controlled trials or quasi-randomised trials was available.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence for the effect of weight loss on urinary incontinence is building and should be a research priority. Generally, there was insufficient evidence to inform practice reliably about whether lifestyle interventions are helpful in the treatment of urinary incontinence.

### Self-management for men with lower urinary tract symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^68058666]. Annals of Family Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Lower urinary tract symptoms are very common in older men. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of self-management interventions on these symptoms.

Methods

We included randomized controlled trials comparing the effect of self-management interventions (alone or combined with drug therapy) with usual care or drug therapy alone in men with lower urinary tract symptoms. Two independent reviewers screened retrieved articles, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. The primary outcome was lower urinary tract symptom severity. Where data were available, we calculated mean differences (MDs) between the interventions.

Results

Analyses were based on 8 studies among 1,006 adult men. Seven of these studies were judged to be at high risk in 2 of the 7 domains of bias. The nature of the self-management interventions varied across studies. There was a clinically important reduction in the 35-point International Prostate Symptom Score at 6 months favoring self-management interventions compared with usual care (MD = -7.4; 95% CI, -8.8 to -6.1; 2 studies). The reduction in score with self-management was similar to that achieved with drug therapy at 6 to 12 weeks (MD = 0.0; 95% CI, -2.0 to 2.0; 3 studies). Self-management had a smaller, additional benefit at 6 weeks when added to drug therapy (MD = -2.3; 95% CI, -4.1 to -0.5; 1 study).

Conclusions

We found moderate-quality evidence (suggesting reasonable certainty in estimates) for the effectiveness of self-management for treating lower urinary tract symptoms in men. We therefore recommend the use of self-management interventions for this patient population.

### AUA releases guideline on diagnosis and treatment of overactive… [^3fa64fff]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder is characterized by urinary symptoms including urgency, frequency, and nocturia, with or without urge incontinence. The prevalence and severity of symptoms increase with age, and most patients have symptoms for years. The American Urological Association recently published recommendations to provide a clinical framework for the diagnosis and treatment of non-neurogenic overactive bladder. FIRST-LINE TREATMENTS Behavioral therapies should be offered as first-line therapy to all patients with overactive bladder. Antimuscarinic agents may be used in combination with behavioral strategies. Limited evidence suggests that initiating behavioral and pharmacologic therapy simultaneously may improve outcomes, including frequency, voided volume, incontinence, and symptom distress.

SECOND-LINE TREATMENTS Second-line therapies for overactive bladder include oral antimuscarinics. If immediate-release and extended-release formulations are available, the extended-release formulation is preferred because of lower rates of dry mouth. Transdermal oxybutynin also may be offered. If symptoms are not adequately controlled or if adverse effects become intolerable with one antimuscarinic agent, the dosage should be modified or a different agent should be tried. Constipation and dry mouth should be managed before abandoning antimuscarinic therapy. Options may include bowel management, fluid management, dose modification, or alternative antimuscarinics.

Intradetrusor onabotulinumtoxin A may be offered as third-line treatment in select patients who have symptoms that are refractory to first- and second-line treatments. The patient must be willing to return for frequent postvoid residual urine assessments, and must be able and willing to perform self-catheterization if necessary. OTHER TREATMENTS Indwelling catheters are not recommended as a management strategy for overactive bladder except as a last resort in select patients. In rare cases, augmentation cystoplasty or urinary diversion may be considered in patients with severe, refractory, complicated overactive bladder.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^4cdaa3b5]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU Guideline on Overactive Bladder — treatment framework and differential diagnosis: The evidence base used to support this guideline did not favor stepwise "first"→"second"→"third line therapy", and to eliminate the concept of "step therapy", options are grouped by invasiveness with an emphasis on shared decision-making to select therapies based on the patient's needs, desires, and side effect tolerance; there are eight treatment categories: incontinence management strategies, behavioral therapies, optimization of co-morbidities, non-invasive therapies, pharmacologic therapies, minimally invasive therapies, invasive therapies, and indwelling catheters, and patients may select from multiple categories simultaneously. Differential diagnosis and contributors include that interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome shares urinary frequency and urgency with or without UUI, but bladder and/or pelvic pain, including dyspareunia, is crucial; genitourinary syndrome of menopause can contribute to urgency and incontinence symptoms and there is some evidence for improvement with vaginal (but not systemic) estrogen; urinary tract infection can mimic OAB but is generally acute, shorter in duration, accompanied by cues such as dysuria or suprapubic discomfort, and resolves with antibiotics; and lower urinary tract symptoms related to neurological conditions such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis are considered neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction and not idiopathic OAB. Patients with prostates experience OAB nearly as often as those without and may be underdiagnosed and undertreated; some have both benign prostatic hyperplasia and OAB, while others have OAB alone and would benefit from diagnosis specific treatment. Because the term "refractory OAB" lacks a clear definition and consensus, the guideline has refrained from using it.

### Diagnosis and treatment of overactive bladder (non-neurogenic) in adults: AUA / SUFU guideline [^c143da29]. The Journal of Urology (2012). Medium credibility.

Overactive bladder (AUA/SUFU) — clinical research future directions emphasize that several validated OAB-symptom and OAB-symptom bother tools have been developed, but objective measures of urgency remain poorly assessed, with urgency defined as "urgency is the complaint of a sudden compelling desire to pass urine which is difficult to defer". Investigators have tested urgency questionnaires for validity and reliability, yet no single measure is used consistently across trials, limiting comparability. The guideline notes that "Clinical studies should use validated standardized measures to report subjective outcomes", and specifies that objective outcomes "should include frequency, nocturia, urgency, incontinence episode frequency and reporting of the variance for each of these measures", with meta-analytic efforts hampered by inconsistent variance reporting. It identifies populations needing study: "The effect of treatment of OAB on the elderly, the very frail and those with pre-existing cognitive deficiencies needs further research", including "measures of cognitive side effects from anti-muscarinic treatments".

### Biofeedback therapy for children: what is the maximum number of sessions we should offer? [^31b2e272]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Biofeedback therapy is an effective but resource intensive treatment for pediatric dysfunctional voiding. Based on our center's experience, we evaluated the rate of clinical improvement from biofeedback in order to identify the maximum number of sessions to offer patients.

Methods

We reviewed 490 pediatric patients who underwent at least 6 sessions of biofeedback from 2013 to 2021. At each session, patients and their parents documented their urinary symptoms (urgency, frequency, pain, and difficulties with stream), incontinence, medications, and stool pattern. This longitudinal data was abstracted, and the log odds of urinary symptoms or incontinence was modelled with number of sessions as a predictor using generalized estimating equations and robust standard errors in SAS v9.4. Gender and bowel dysfunction were included as interactions terms. A logistic regression using absence of urinary symptoms at last biofeedback session as a dependent variable was done to further explore differences between genders.

Results

Patients were predominantly female (324/490, 66%) with a mean age of 8.9 years (SD 3.3 years). Most common symptoms at presentation were urinary urgency (389/490, 79%) and urinary incontinence (413/490, 84%). Medication use was common at the time of the first session (191/490, 39%) with males more likely to be on alpha-blockers (54/166 vs 1/324, p < 0.001) and females more likely to be on antibiotic prophylaxis (68/324 vs 2/166, p < 0.001). The probability of having urinary symptoms or incontinence decreased up to session 11 (9 months from initial visit). There was slower rate of improvement after session 8 (3 months). Controlling for age, symptoms, and medication use at initial visit, male patients were less likely to report symptom resolution at the time of the last session (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.33, 0.89). The nadir for reporting symptoms occurred by session 22 for male patients, compared to session 10 for female patients.

Conclusions

Clinical improvement from biofeedback for pediatric patients with dysfunctional voiding may take up to 9 months of therapy, but most cases that improve do so by 3 months. The effect of gender on biofeedback efficacy requires further study, but males may have slower response to biofeedback. Our data provides guidance on when maximum benefit from biofeedback can be expected before considering re-evaluation or other therapies for lower urinary tract symptoms.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^cdfaa89b]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU Guideline on Overactive Bladder — adjunctive and lifestyle measures — notes that adjuvant measures such as voiding diaries, frequency/volume charts, and mobile electronic apps are often used as an assessment tool in OAB; however their utility in improving the results of bladder training as an OAB treatment is unclear. Review of fluid intake is recommended, and management of these habits may improve OAB symptoms in some individuals. There is some evidence supporting dietary modification, increasing physical activity, and caffeine reduction in the treatment of OAB, with or without UUI, and similar to bladder training these interventions are considered very low risk, inexpensive and have few if any adverse effects and therefore can be considered in selected individuals.

### Nocturia: evaluation and management [^a90512d4]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Nocturia (ie, awakening to void one or more times per night) is common in adults, with increasing prevalence in older age. Nocturia is associated with increased risk of falls and fractures, cognitive impairment, and depressed mood. In general, mechanisms for nocturia fall into one of four categories: increased nighttime urine production, decreased storage ability, incomplete bladder emptying, or primary sleep disorder. Although screening for nocturia currently is not recommended, patients reporting bothersome symptoms should be evaluated and treated. Initial workup includes assessing urinary symptoms, fluid intake, and comorbidities. Using validated nocturia questionnaires and frequency-volume charts (bladder diaries) can aid in diagnosis. A urinalysis should be performed for all patients. Lifestyle modifications and treatment of underlying comorbidities are first-line therapies for nocturia. Limitation of fluid intake, especially in the evening; addressing timing of diuretic intake; and sleep hygiene are recommended. Pharmacotherapy should be reserved for those unresponsive to lifestyle modifications and adequate treatment of comorbidities. Pharmacotherapy should target the etiology of nocturia, such as nocturnal polyuria, overactive bladder, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Patients with refractory symptoms should be referred for further treatment (eg, onabotulinumtoxinA injection, sacral neuromodulation, surgical management of benign prostatic hyperplasia).

### Overactive bladder [^9a12b89c]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a condition affecting millions of individuals in the United States. Anticholinergics are the mainstay of treatment. Bladder botulinum toxin injections have shown an improvement in symptoms of OAB equivalent to anticholinergic therapy. Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation can decrease symptoms of urinary frequency and urge incontinence. Sacral neuromodulation for refractory patients has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of OAB, urge incontinence, and urinary retention. Few randomized, head-to-head comparisons of the different available alternatives exist; however, patients now have increasing options to manage their symptoms and improve their quality of life.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^d107f3c5]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Combination therapy for overactive bladder (OAB) — Clinicians may use a layering or combination approach of two or more therapies simultaneously; however, to date, there is no significant evidence to support or refute these practices and there is no general agreement regarding the optimal delivery of combination therapy including when to add on additional therapies or discontinue them. There is a small body of evidence emerging regarding the use of behavioral, non-invasive (e.g., transcutaneous stimulation), and pharmacologic therapies in combination with mixed outcomes. Four RCTs were identified that evaluated combination therapy using behavioral, pharmacotherapy, and non-invasive stimulation techniques; in two studies that added therapy to behavioral therapy and/or Kegel exercises, all study arms improved from baseline and the groups with combination therapy had the highest degree of improvement. TTNS combined with Kegel exercises and bladder training resulted in statistically significant superior improvement in questionnaire scores, micturition frequency, nocturia, and UUI episodes in women. The addition of tolterodine extended release (ER) to PFMT and behavioral changes in male patients demonstrated overall improvement relative to either therapy alone but did not reach statistical significance. Using vaginal stimulation techniques with TTNS or topical estrogen had mixed outcomes; vaginal stimulation with TTNS did not improve the overall outcomes of TTNS, whereas topical estrogen and vaginal stimulation appear to have a synergistic effect with better outcomes in the combination group.

### Variation in the definitions of urinary retention in studies of intravesical botulinum toxin for idiopathic overactive bladder: a narrative systematic review [^6d10e1ad]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Overactive bladder (OAB) is defined by the International Continence Society (ICS) as "a disease that causes urinary urgency associated with nocturia, urinary frequency, with or without urge incontinence, in the absence of infective or anatomical pathology". Whilst OAB can also be secondary to other causes (e.g. neurological conditions, previous surgery, bladder outflow obstruction), this paper will focus on idiopathic overactive bladder syndrome (iOAB).

Intravesical injection of botulinum toxin A (BoNT) is a treatment option for iOAB, often used if prior nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments were ineffective or caused intolerable side effects. BoNT works by preventing the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction, resulting in a temporary decrease in muscular activity of the bladder. The procedure is minimally invasive, can be done under a local anaesthetic and is effective, with complete continence being observed in 40–80% of patients. The most common and significant adverse effects include urinary tract infection (UTI) and urinary retention. The mechanism of urinary retention is likely secondary to reversible muscle weakness from presynaptic neuromuscular blockade that may stop the bladder from emptying adequately. Despite widespread use, there are currently no international guidelines defining urinary retention post‐BoNT injection for iOAB. As noted in multiple studies, inconsistency prohibits formal determination of the incidence and assessment of the impact of retention.

Urinary retention post BoNT injection is usually identified by an increased post‐void residual (PVR) volume performed by ultrasound. Patients in urinary retention are often commenced on clean intermittent catheterisation (CIC) until the bladder muscle recovers. Urinary retention after intravesical BoNT injection has significant ramifications on patient distress due to the need for catheterisation, and also on future decisions on the timing and dosage of BoNT. The quoted risk of urinary retention, and by inference need for CIC, affects patient decision‐making, as catheterisation is seen as a major disadvantage of BoNT treatment. In view of this, a narrative systematic review was undertaken to identify standard definitions and rates of urinary retention following intravesical BoNT injection for iOAB to better inform shared decision making.
