## Question

What is loading dose of vigamox eye drop

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether Vigamox (moxifloxacin 0.5% ophthalmic solution) requires a loading dose and, if so, what the correct loading regimen would be. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled indication and standard dosing for bacterial conjunctivitis. Then, I should verify whether any authoritative guidelines or trials describe a loading dose for conjunctivitis. Next, I will check for loading-dose regimens in corneal ulcers/keratitis, which are a different, more severe indication. After that, I should review pharmacokinetic data to see if there is a rationale for loading in conjunctivitis. Finally, I will synthesize a clear, clinically grounded answer and counseling points, making sure I distinguish labeled use from off-label or emergency protocols.

> Let me first confirm the labeled indication and standard regimen. Vigamox is indicated for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis, and the FDA labeling instructs instilling one drop into the affected eye three times daily for 7 days. There is no mention of a loading dose in the official prescribing information, which argues against a loading strategy for routine conjunctivitis treatment [^111J1RBe] [^111bHWDv] [^112TMG2S].

> Wait, let me verify whether any trials or labeling language hint at a loading phase for conjunctivitis. The clinical studies summarized in the FDA materials evaluated dosing three times daily for 4–7 days and reported clinical cure rates around 66–69% by Day 5–6, again without any loading-dose protocol described, reinforcing that the standard TID regimen is the evidence-based approach for conjunctivitis [^115Kmbq8] [^111VbKzM] [^1112jod9].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — some ophthalmic antibiotics do use loading for certain conditions, so I should double-check if that applies here. For example, ofloxacin ophthalmic solution uses a loading phase for bacterial conjunctivitis (frequent dosing every 2 hours while awake initially), but that is specific to ofloxacin's label and does not generalize to Vigamox; likewise, ciprofloxacin ophthalmic has aggressive loading for corneal ulcers, which is a different disease state altogether, so extrapolating those regimens to Vigamox for conjunctivitis would be inappropriate [^1176dGzj] [^1179sBe5].

> I will now examine whether loading is used for Vigamox in more serious ocular surface infections. For corneal ulcers/keratitis, expert guidelines recommend a fluoroquinolone loading strategy with very frequent drops (for example, every 5–15 minutes initially, then hourly), and wilderness medicine guidance for suspected corneal ulcers describes a moxifloxacin loading sequence of 1 drop every 5 minutes for 30 minutes, then every 30 minutes for 6 hours, then hourly until definitive care; however, these are off-label, indication-specific emergency protocols and are not part of the conjunctivitis labeling for Vigamox [^112azjxU] [^112gCByB] [^112EQ8jW] [^117MtYTh].

> Let me consider the pharmacokinetic rationale. Topical moxifloxacin achieves high local ocular surface concentrations with minimal systemic exposure. Plasma levels after bilateral TID dosing are roughly 1000–1600 times lower than therapeutic oral doses, and conjunctival tissue concentrations after a single drop are initially high but decline quickly, which supports the need for repeated dosing but does not establish a requirement for a loading dose in conjunctivitis. Moreover, PK studies showing higher aqueous levels with intensified preoperative dosing reflect anterior chamber penetration relevant to intraocular surgery or keratitis, not routine conjunctivitis therapy [^113yHKzG] [^115RRDk4] [^113Jmsy1] [^115GpAdN] [^1179CLS6].

> But wait, what if someone argues that more frequent initial dosing could hasten symptom relief in conjunctivitis? I should confirm that no guideline or label endorses this for Vigamox in conjunctivitis; the absence of a loading recommendation in FDA labeling and the lack of supportive conjunctivitis-specific loading data mean that increasing frequency beyond TID for conjunctivitis would be off-label and unsupported by current evidence, even though it might seem pharmacologically plausible [^111J1RBe] [^111bHWDv] [^115Kmbq8].

> Next, I should review practical counseling to ensure safe use. Patients should be instructed to instill one drop into the affected eye three times daily for 7 days, avoid touching the dropper tip to any surface, and refrain from wearing contact lenses during active infection. If there is no improvement in 48–72 hours or if symptoms worsen, they should be re-evaluated to confirm the diagnosis and consider alternative therapy or referral, particularly if keratitis is suspected [^111J1RBe] [^114DfFjR].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion is precise: Vigamox does not have a loading dose for bacterial conjunctivitis. The standard regimen is one drop three times daily for 7 days. Loading strategies with moxifloxacin exist for corneal ulcers/keratitis in guideline-based or emergency settings, but those are off-label and should not be applied to routine conjunctivitis treatment without ophthalmologic oversight [^111J1RBe] [^111bHWDv] [^112azjxU] [^112EQ8jW].

---

Vigamox (moxifloxacin 0.5%) **does not require a loading dose** for bacterial conjunctivitis [^111J1RBe]; the standard regimen is 1 drop in the affected eye 3 times daily for 7 days [^111bHWDv]. For corneal ulcers or severe keratitis, **use a loading dose of 1 drop every 5–15 minutes for the first 1–2 hours**, then continue frequent dosing (e.g. hourly) until stabilized, per clinical judgment and guideline recommendations [^112azjxU] [^112gCByB]. Always follow the labeled dosing for conjunctivitis and adjust only for severe infections under ophthalmic supervision.

---

## Standard dosing regimen for bacterial conjunctivitis

For bacterial conjunctivitis, the **recommended regimen** is 1 drop in the affected eye 3 times daily for 7 days [^111J1RBe] [^111bHWDv]. No loading dose is **required or recommended** for this indication [^115My95M].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting standard dosing

Clinical trials show that the standard regimen achieves high clinical cure and microbiological eradication rates, supporting its use without a loading dose [^115Kmbq8] [^1112jod9]. Specifically, clinical cure rates of 66–69% by day 5–6 and microbiological eradication rates of 84–94% have been reported [^111zweGP].

---

## Situations requiring a loading dose

Although no loading dose is needed for conjunctivitis [^111J1RBe], **severe infections** such as corneal ulcers or bacterial keratitis may benefit from an initial intensive dosing phase to rapidly achieve therapeutic levels [^112gCByB]. In these cases, **clinical judgment and guideline recommendations** should guide use of a loading dose [^112azjxU].

---

## Recommended loading dose regimen for severe infections

For corneal ulcers or severe bacterial keratitis, the following **loading dose regimen** is recommended:

| **Time period** | **Dosage** |
|-|-|
| First 1–2 hours | 1 drop every 5–15 minutes (loading dose) [^112gCByB] |
| After loading dose | Continue frequent dosing (e.g. every hour) until stabilized [^112azjxU] |

---

This approach ensures rapid achievement of therapeutic concentrations in ocular tissues, thereby improving clinical outcomes in severe infections [^115GpAdN].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting loading dose in severe infections

Evidence supports an initial intensive dosing phase for corneal ulcers and severe keratitis, with **rapid achievement of therapeutic levels** and improved outcomes [^112azjxU]. However, this approach is reserved for severe infections and should be guided by clinical judgment and ophthalmic supervision [^112gCByB].

---

## Safety considerations

Vigamox is generally well tolerated; typical adverse effects include mild **ocular discomfort**, dryness, and irritation. Systemic absorption is minimal, **reducing systemic adverse effects** [^113yHKzG]. Hypersensitivity reactions are rare but possible; patients with known hypersensitivity to moxifloxacin or other fluoroquinolones **should avoid use** [^117159kV].

---

## Patient counseling points

Patients should be counseled on the following:

- **Proper administration**: Instill one drop in the affected eye three times daily for 7 days [^111J1RBe].
- **Avoid contamination**: Do not touch the dropper tip to any surface [^114DfFjR].
- **Contact lenses**: Avoid wearing contact lenses during treatment [^114DfFjR].
- **Adherence**: Complete the full course of therapy even if symptoms improve [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Standard regimen**: 1 drop in the affected eye three times daily for 7 days [^111J1RBe].
- **Loading dose**: Not required for bacterial conjunctivitis [^notfound].
- **Severe infections**: Consider a loading dose (1 drop every 5–15 minutes for the first 1–2 hours) for corneal ulcers or severe keratitis, followed by frequent dosing until stabilized [^112gCByB] [^112azjxU].
- **Clinical judgment**: Always guide dosing adjustments in severe infections [^notfound].

---

Vigamox **does not require a loading dose** for bacterial conjunctivitis; the standard regimen is 1 drop 3 times daily for 7 days [^111J1RBe]. A loading dose may be used for severe infections such as corneal ulcers or bacterial keratitis, but this should be guided by clinical judgment and ophthalmic supervision [^112gCByB].

7 DRUG INTERACTIONS

Drug-drug interaction studies have not been conducted with VIGAMOX®. In vitro studies indicate that moxifloxacin does not inhibit CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or CYP1A2, indicating that moxifloxacin is unlikely to alter the pharmacokinetics of drugs metabolized by these cytochrome P450 isozymes.

### Moxifloxacin hydrochloride (moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution) [^116cDGur]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Pregnant cynomolgus monkeys were administered moxifloxacin at doses of 10, 30, or 100 mg/kg/day by intragastric intubation between Gestation Days 20 and 50, targeting the period of organogenesis. At the maternal toxic doses of ≥ 30 mg/kg/day, increased abortion, vomiting, and diarrhea were observed. Smaller fetuses/reduced fetal body weights were observed at 100 mg/kg/day (2864 times the human AUC at the recommended human ophthalmic dose). The NOAEL for fetal toxicity was 10 mg/kg/day (174 times the human AUC at the recommended human ophthalmic dose).

In a pre- and postnatal study, rats were administered moxifloxacin by oral gavage at doses of 20, 100, and 500 mg/kg/day from Gestation Day 6 until the end of lactation. Maternal death occurred during gestation at 500 mg/kg/day. Slight increases in the duration of pregnancy, reduced pup birth weight, and decreased prenatal and neonatal survival were observed at 500 mg/kg/day (estimated 277 times the human AUC at the recommended human ophthalmic dose). The NOAEL for pre- and postnatal development was 100 mg/ kg/day (estimated 30 times the human AUC at the recommended human ophthalmic dose).

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There is no data regarding the presence of moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infants, or the effects on milk production/excretion to inform risk of moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution to an infant during lactation.

A study in lactating rats has shown transfer of moxifloxacin into milk following oral administration.

Systemic levels of moxifloxacin following topical ocular administration are low [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)], and it is not known whether measurable levels of moxifloxacin would be present in maternal milk following topical ocular administration.

The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution.

### Efficacy and tolerability of a fixed-dose moxifloxacin-dexamethasone formulation for topical prophylaxis in LASIK: a comparative, double-masked clinical trial [^113xWfns]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the efficacy and tolerability of a fixed-dose combination of 0.5% moxifloxacin and 0.1% dexamethasone formulation (MFLX/DEX) vs conventional dosing with both agents dosed separately for prophylaxis after laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK).

Methods

A prospective, randomized, double-masked, parallel-group study of 64 patients undergoing bilateral LASIK. Patients received either combined MFLX/DEX and placebo or moxifloxacin and dexamethasone dosed separately in both eyes. Baseline and postoperative assessments were made on surgery days -2, 1, 3, 8, and 15 and consisted of uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), intraocular pressure (IOP), severity of inflammation, endothelial cell loss, ocular pain, burning, and itching sensation. The posterior segment was evaluated at the screening and exit visits.

Results

Of the 64 patients treated, 7 eyes did not meet the inclusion criteria and were excluded from the analysis. No ocular infection or persistent inflammation developed. Postoperatively there were no statistical differences between treatments for most parameters measured. More eyes in the combined MFLX/DEX group reported pruritus and burning post operatively; however, differences were also observed at baseline.

Conclusion

Topical prophylaxis with MFLX/DEX eye drops was well tolerated and is therapeutically equivalent to conventional dosing with moxifloxacin and dexamethasone from individual bottles.

### Pharmacokinetics and aqueous humor penetration of levofloxacin 1.5% and moxifloxacin 0.5% in patients undergoing cataract surgery [^117PUGqQ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Pharmacokinetic results

Since this was a pooled non-compartmental analysis, each eye contributed one time point to the respective treatment group. One subject contributed two samples (each eye was randomized independently of the other) while all other subjects only contributed one sample. A total of 98 aqueous humor samples were analyzed with 50 samples in the levofloxacin group (14, 14, 10, and 12 concentrations in the 1-, 2-, 4-, and 6-hour subgroups, respectively) and a total of 48 samples analyzed in the moxifloxacin group (11, 13, 12, and 12 concentrations in each subgroup, respectively). The mean (25–75th interquartile range) concentration vs time of each treatment group is shown in Figure 2. The mean concentrations of levofloxacin were greater than 50% higher than moxifloxacin concentrations across all time points, and the mean levofloxacin concentrations were statistically significantly greater than the mean moxifloxacin concentrations at 1 hour (1.34 vs 0.83 μg/mL, P = 0.025), 2 hours (1.60 vs 0.796 μg/mL, P = 0.008) and 6 hours (0.70 μg/mL vs 0.40 μg/mL, P = 0.016) post last dose. Non-compartmental estimates of AUC 0–6 and C max for each treatment arm are depicted in Figures 3 and 4. The pooled AUC 0–6 of levofloxacin aqueous humor concentration was significantly greater than that of moxifloxacin (6.2 μg⋅hr/mL and 3.8 μg⋅hr/mL respectively, P < 0.001), and a significant between-treatment difference was observed in mean C max values (1.43 μg/mL and 0.87 μg/mL respectively, P = 0.008).

Safety

No treatment-emergent adverse events were reported during the course of the study.

### Vitreal penetration of oral moxifloxacin in humans [^114Pgw9t]. Retina (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the vitreal penetration of moxifloxacin after oral administration.

Design

Prospective, nonrandomized clinical series.

Methods

Twenty-four patients (mean age = 62.8 years) undergoing elective pars plana vitrectomy were assigned to a dosing group: control (n = 3), which received no medication; single-dose (n = 11), which received one 400 mg oral dose of moxifloxacin 3 hours before surgery; and five-dose (n = 10), which received one 400 mg dose on each of the 4 days preceding surgery and a fifth dose 3 hours before surgery. Vitreous samples were obtained and analyzed.

Results

Control, below quantifiable levels; single-dose, 0.572 ± 0.239 microg/mL; and five-dose, 1.200 ± 0.645 microg/mL.

Conclusions

Five doses of oral moxifloxacin lead to higher intravitreal drug concentrations than single-dose administration. Both regimens, however, achieve levels that exceed the MIC90 of many bacteria implicated in postoperative endophthalmitis.

### Aqueous penetration of orally and topically administered moxifloxacin [^113TkHE6]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2015). Low credibility.

Aim

To assess the intraocular penetration of 0.5% moxifloxacin hydrochloride into aqueous humour after oral and topical administration.

Methods

A prospective, interventional study of 42 patients scheduled to undergo cataract surgery was carried out. Out of the 42 subjects, 21 were randomly categorised into Group I and received one drop of 0.5% topical moxifloxacin four times, at 15min intervals starting 75min before the surgery. Another 21 subjects were categorised into Group II and all subjects in this group were administered a single tablet of 400mg of moxifloxacin, 12h before the surgery. Estimation of moxifloxacin in aqueous samples was carried out using high-performance liquid chromatography. Results were analysed using Student unpaired 't' test and analysis of variance. The value of p < 0.05 was considered to be significant.

Results

Mean aqueous concentration of moxifloxacin attained in the oral group (n = 21) was 0.504 ± 0.30μg/mL while that in the topical group (n = 21) was 2.04 ± 0.72μg/mL, and this difference in levels was statistically significant (p < 0.005). The levels attained by both the groups well exceeded the MIC90 (minimum inhibitory concentration of antibiotic required to inhibit growth of 90% of bacteria strains) levels for most of the organisms causing endophthalmitis. Penetration of moxifloxacin in aqueous in both the groups was not affected by gender, intraocular pressure or comorbidities significantly. However, aqueous levels were found to be higher among the younger subjects within the topical group.

Conclusions

Moxifloxacin has an impressive spectrum of coverage and this pharmacokinetic study reinforces its potential as a prophylactic drug against intraocular infections, given the high aqueous levels post topical administration.

### Absorption of topical moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution into human aqueous humor [^115GpAdN]. Cornea (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the absorption of moxifloxacin into human aqueous humor after administration of moxifloxacin hydrochloride ophthalmic solution, 0.5% as base.

Methods

Cataract patients were randomly allocated to receive 1 drop every 15 minutes for 4 doses before surgery (group 1) or 1 drop 4 times per day on the day before surgery plus the same preoperative regimen as group 1 (group 2). The last dose was administered 0.25, 0.50, 1, 2, or 3 hours before aqueous humor sampling. Samples from 30 patients per group were analyzed by a validated HPLC/MS/MS method.

Results

For group 1, the mean ± SD C(max) was 1.50 ± 0.75 microg/mL and occurred at 0.5 hour after dosing. The mean C(max) for group 2 was 1.74 ± 0.66 microg/mL and was reached at 1 to 2 hours. Mean AUC(0–3h) for groups 1 and 2 were 3.16 ± 0.29 and 4.41 ± 0.48 microg.h/mL, respectively. The difference in AUC(0–3h) was statistically significant (P = 0.04), but the difference in Cmax was not.

Conclusions

Topical moxifloxacin was well absorbed. Maximum moxifloxacin concentrations were approximately 30 times higher than the median MICs for common pathogens in bacterial endophthalmitis, indicating that either regimen may provide sufficient concentrations to prevent postoperative endophthalmitis.

### Pharmacokinetics of azithromycin and moxifloxacin in human conjunctiva and aqueous humor during and after the approved dosing regimens [^114URLGP]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the ocular pharmacokinetics of azithromycin and moxifloxacin in human conjunctiva and aqueous humor in subjects undergoing cataract surgery.

Design

Multicenter, open-label, randomized study.

Methods

Subjects scheduled for routine cataract surgery and with normal-appearing conjunctiva were eligible. One conjunctival biopsy sample and 1 aqueous humor sample were obtained from subjects randomly assigned to 1 of 10 prespecified time points (1 to 312 hours) after treatment initiation of azithromycin ophthalmic solution 1% or moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5%. Samples were assayed using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry.

Results

Azithromycin 1% provided high concentrations (peak level, 559.7 μg/g) in human conjunctiva that were sustained at levels 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than those of moxifloxacin 0.5% throughout the 7-day dosing period and for at least 7 days thereafter. Azithromycin also showed an extended half-life (65.7 hours) in conjunctiva relative to that of moxifloxacin (28.6 hours). Accordingly, the concentration of azithromycin was maintained well above the minimum inhibitory concentration required for inhibition of growth of 90% of tested bacterial isolates for at least 7 days, whereas moxifloxacin conjunctival levels fell to levels at or less than the minimum inhibitory concentration required for inhibition of growth of 90% of tested bacterial isolates approximately 24 hours after the last dose. Peak aqueous humor concentration of moxifloxacin was higher (0.77 μg/mL) than that of azithromycin (0.053 μg/mL). No clinically relevant safety findings were observed.

Conclusions

Azithromycin 1% demonstrated high, therapeutic levels in the conjunctiva that were maintained up to 7 days after completion of a 1-week dosing regimen. Aqueous humor levels, however, were subtherapeutic with this dosing regimen. In comparison, moxifloxacin achieved lower conjunctival tissue levels, but higher aqueous humor levels.

### Cornea / external disease summary benchmarks – 2024 [^112gCByB]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Bacterial keratitis (initial evaluation) — care management notes that topical antibiotic eye drops are capable of achieving high tissue levels, a preferred method of treatment in most cases. Single-drug therapy using a fluoroquinolone is as effective as combination therapy utilizing fortified antibiotics, and fortified topical antibiotics to be considered for large and/or visually significant corneal infiltrates, especially if hypopyon is present, with combination fortified-antibiotic therapy as an alternative for severe infection or eyes unresponsive to initial treatment; there is no difference found in corneal perforation rates across classes of topical antibiotics. Topical corticosteroid therapy may have a beneficial role, but much of the literature has not shown a difference in clinical outcome, and subconjunctival antibiotics may be helpful where adherence is questionable or there is a delay in obtaining fortified antibiotics. For central or severe keratitis (e.g., deep stromal involvement or an infiltrate larger than 2 mm with extensive suppuration), use a loading dose (e.g., every 5 to 15 minutes), followed by frequent applications (e.g., every hour is recommended), and severe cases should be followed daily initially, at least until stable or improvement is confirmed.

One eye of 10 New Zealand white rabbits had CXL treatment. One month after treatment and 1 hour before an aqueous humor sample was obtained, 1 drop of 5 mg/mL moxifloxacin (Vigamox) was applied to both eyes of each rabbit every 15 minutes for a total of 4 drops. The aqueous humor samples were sent for high-performance liquid chromatography for antibiotic-concentration analysis. The eyes were enucleated and sent for histology analysis.

Results

Moxifloxacin levels were obtained and analyzed for all 20 eyes. The mean level of moxifloxacin was 2.26 μg/mL ± 0.89 (SD) (range 1.09 to 4.20 μg/mL) in the treated eyes and 2.43 ± 1.17 μg/mL (range 0.89 to 4.72 μg/mL) in the untreated eyes. The difference between the groups was not statistically significant. Of the 10 eye pairs, lower moxifloxacin aqueous humor concentrations were found in 6 treated eyes and 4 untreated eyes.

Conclusion

Penetration of moxifloxacin into the anterior chamber of rabbits was not influenced by previous CXL treatment.

### Prevention of endophthalmitis by collagen shields presoaked in fourth-generation fluoroquinolones versus by topical prophylaxis [^115mqwB9]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To compare the prophylaxis of collagen shields presoaked in antibiotics versus antibiotic drops after bacterial anterior chamber challenge.

Setting

John A. Moran Eye Center, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah, USA.

Methods

Forty rabbits received bilateral 0.03 mL intracameral injections of Staphylococcus epidermidis (5 x 10(8) colony-forming units). Four groups of 10 rabbits had their eyes randomized to receive (1) 3 mg/mL gatifloxacin (Zymar) drops or shield in Zymar, (2) Zymar drops or shield in 10 mg/mL gatifloxacin (Tequin), (3) 5 mg/mL moxifloxacin (Vigamox) drops or shield in Vigamox, or (4) balanced salt solution (BSS) drops or shield in BSS. Each eye received Zymar, Vigamox, or BSS 4 times 1 hour before injection. The antibiotic-BSS was administered every 2 hours (5 doses total). One day later, signs of endophthalmitis were scored under the slitlamp.

Results

Groups 1 and 2 had significantly lower endophthalmitis incidences (total score ≥ 8) than the BSS controls. Shield scores were not significantly different from those of the counterpart drops. The comparison between drops was not significant (P = 0.0513); the difference between shields (P = 0.0232) and the post-comparison Zymar versus BSS shields (P = 0.0021) were significant.

Conclusions

Topical therapy with gatifloxacin before and after intraocular bacteria challenge led to lower incidences of endophthalmitis in rabbits. Prophylaxis with presoaked collagen shields was not statistically different than that with topical drops.

### Injection volume and intracameral moxifloxacin dose [^112jGD7n]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To test the effect of injection volume and concentration on dosing and residence time of moxifloxacin in the anterior chamber (AC).

Setting

Kaiser Permanente, Walnut Creek, California, USA.

Design

Experimental study.

Methods

Moxifloxacin 0.5%/0.05 mL, moxifloxacin 0.5%/0.10 mL, and moxifloxacin 0.15%/0.50 mL were drawn into 5 1.0 mL syringes each, injected into tared vials, and weighed. The doses delivered were calculated. The AC concentrations and elimination rates of the drug for two AC volumes were modeled for each dosing method.

Results

The 0.05 mL injection volume resulted in the greatest range (35 μg) of delivered dose compared with larger injection volumes (≤ 25 μg). The mathematical model predicted that variation in dosing in each group would result in differences of 12 minutes or less for the presence of the drug in the AC. Injection of 0.5%/0.1 mL produced AC concentrations above 500 μg/mL for 1.9 to 3.0 hours and above 64 μg/mL for 5.5 to 6.5 hours, depending on the AC volume; however, flushing with a 0.15% concentration sustained AC levels for 1.9 hours and 5.5 hours, respectively, for the two AC volumes.

Conclusions

Smaller injection volumes of a higher concentration moxifloxacin resulted in less accuracy and less precision in the delivered dose (0.05 mL, P = 0.005; 0.10 mL, P = 0.03); however, the clinical significance of this might vary. Injection of 0.5%/0.1 mL and flushing with 0.15%/0.5 mL of moxifloxacin would provide similar drug AC residence times according to the model. Flushing provided more consistent AC concentrations with differing AC volumes.

Moxifloxacin solution is frequently injected at the conclusion of cataract surgery for endophthalmitis prophylaxis. 2 different concentrations are most commonly available in the United States for intracameral (IC) use: 0.5% (5 mg/mL) and 0.1% (1 mg/mL). The recommended volume to be injected is different for the 2 concentrations, and incorrect dosing can increase the risk of toxic anterior segment syndrome or endophthalmitis. In addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently published an alert regarding potential adverse events associated with intraocular compounded moxifloxacin. This clinical advisory reviews the optimal dosing of IC moxifloxacin based on current evidence.

### Comparison of 2 moxifloxacin regimens for preoperative prophylaxis: prospective randomized triple-masked trial. part 1: aqueous concentration of moxifloxacin [^1179CLS6]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To evaluate the aqueous concentration of moxifloxacin following 2 dosing regimens of topically administered moxifloxacin hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 0.5% (Vigamox).

Setting

Iladevi Cataract & IOL Research Centre, Ahmedabad, India.

Methods

In this prospective randomized triple-masked clinical trial, 156 patients having cataract surgery were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 regimens of preoperative prophylaxis. In Group A (n = 76), Vigamox was instilled 4 times a day 1 day before surgery plus 1 drop 2 hours before surgery (total of 5 drops). In Group B (n = 76), Vigamox was first instilled 2 hours before surgery and then every 15 minutes for 1 hour (total of 5 drops). In both groups, aqueous samples (0.1 mL) were collected within 2 hours of the first instillation on the day of surgery and stored at -80 degrees C. The antibiotic concentration in all aqueous aspirates was determined using high-performance liquid chromatography. Data were analyzed using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov t test; 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.

Results

The mean aqueous humor concentration of moxifloxacin was 1.58 microg/mL ± 0.80 (SD) in Group A and 2.05 ± 0.72 microg/mL in Group B (P < .0001; 95% CI, -0.72 to -0.22).

Conclusions

Both dosing regimens produced substantially higher aqueous concentrations than the known minimum inhibitory concentration for Staphylococcus epidermidis. Topical moxifloxacin administered 2 hours before surgery achieved significantly higher aqueous concentrations than topical moxifloxacin administered 1 day before surgery with 1 drop given on the day of surgery.

### Penetration of topically applied gatifloxacin 0.3%, moxifloxacin 0.5%, and ciprofloxacin 0.3% into the aqueous humor [^116spuAJ]. Ophthalmology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the aqueous penetration of 3 commercially available ophthalmic fluoroquinolones.

Design

Prospective, double-masked, clinical study.

Participants

Fifty-two eyes of 52 patients.

Intervention

Fifty-two patients undergoing cataract surgery were given preoperative topical gatifloxacin 0.3% (Zymar), moxifloxacin 0.5% (Vigamox), or ciprofloxacin 0.3% (Ciloxan). The patients were instructed to use their antibiotic drops 4 times a day for 3 days before surgery. On the day of surgery, patients were given their assigned antibiotic every 15 minutes for 3 doses, 1 hour before their procedure. At the time of surgery, 0.1 mL of aqueous fluid was aspirated from the anterior chamber with an air cannula needle attached to a tuberculin syringe. The aspirate was immediately stored at -70 degrees C.

Main Outcome Measure

Fluoroquinolone concentrations were determined by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography assay technique with ultraviolet detection at a wavelength of 275 nm.

Results

Mean aqueous concentration of gatifloxacin in 16 eyes was 0.63 microg/ml (standard deviation [SD], 0.30), moxifloxacin in 14 eyes was 1.31 microg/ml (SD, 0.46), and the mean concentration of ciprofloxacin in 22 eyes was 0.15 microg/ml (SD, 0.11).

Conclusions

Both moxifloxacin (P < 0.001) and gatifloxacin (P < 0.005) penetrated the aqueous humor at significantly higher levels than ciprofloxacin. Moxifloxacin penetrated into the aqueous humor at significantly higher levels than gatifloxacin (P < 0.05). The anterior chamber levels of moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin may be due to the difference in antibiotic concentration.

### Accelerated epithelium-off corneal collagen cross-linking for keratoconus: 12-month results [^111kGoGY]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2019). Medium credibility.

Surgical Technique

Epithelium-off accelerated technique was used. The procedure was performed in the operating room under complete aseptic conditions. After topical anesthesia with benoxinate hydrochloride (Benox, EIPICO Ophthalmics, Egypt) eye drops four times 2 mins apart, a blunt spatula was used to debride the central 9 mm of the corneal epithelium. Riboflavin (0.1%solution VibeX; Avedro Inc. Waltham, MA) drops were instilled over the de-epithelized cornea four times every 2 mins. Exposure to 365 nm UVA by the Avedro's KXL ® system (Avedro Inc. Boston, MA) was performed with a total surface dose of 7.2 joules which was pulsed (1 s on, 1 s off) for 5 mins and 20 s, achieving a total delivery of 120 mWatt. A bandage contact lens was then applied.

Following the procedure, moxifloxacin 0.5% (Vigamox, Alcon, USA) eye drops were prescribed four times daily for 1 week, lubricant eye drops (Systane, Alcon, USA) five times daily for 1 month, and tobramycin/dexamethasone combination eye drops (TobraDex, Alcon, USA) three times daily for the first 2 weeks then replaced by fluorometholone acetate (0.1%, Efemyo, Orchidia Pharmaceutical, Egypt) four times daily, which was then tapered over 2 weeks.

Postoperative Evaluation

Patients were examined from the first day postoperatively and after 1 week for assessment of corneal re-epithelization where contact lens was removed. At 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after the procedure, patients were examined according to the study protocol. UCVA, BCVA, refraction, and corneal topography and aberrations were tested and recorded at each visit starting from 3rd month postoperatively to 12th month. Data collected during follow-up periods were used for comparison with baseline preoperative values.

Data Collection And Analysis

Data were collected from 4 maps refractive analysis and Zernike analysis of corneal topography preoperatively and postoperatively for all patients. Statistical analysis was performed using a commercially available software program (SPSS 18; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Values were presented as mean and standard deviation (SD). Data were explored for normality using Kolmogorov–Smirnov test of normality. Paired (dependent) t -test was used to compare preoperative and postoperative values. P-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

### Relative efficacy of intracameral moxifloxacin injection methods [^111chGet]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To determine the amount of moxifloxacin remaining in the anterior chamber (AC), immediately after its injection using 3 current injection methods, assuming mixing and fluid exchange with the AC contents during injection of the drug, and to determine the most desirable injection method.

Setting

Department of Ophthalmology and Vision Sciences and Institute of Biomedical Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.

Design

Mathematical modeling.

Methods

Mathematical modeling using first-order mixing methods were used to assess mixing.

Results

The Kaiser method of injecting 0.5 mL × 100 μg/0.1 mL does not achieve the desired 500 μg level of moxifloxacin in the AC. The "straight from the bottle" method of injecting 0.1 mL × 500 μg/0.1 mL is fraught with potential error, yielding a relatively unreliable final amount in the AC. Injecting 0.5 to 0.6 mL × 150 μg/0.1 mL yields a result closest to the desired goal.

Conclusions

Based on the calculation, the most accurate of current methods to deliver 500 μg moxifloxacin intracamerally is the method of 150 μg/0.1 mL × 0.5 to 0.6 mL.

### Summary benchmarks-full set – 2024 [^112azjxU]. AAO (2024). High credibility.

Bacterial keratitis — care management: Topical antibiotic eye drops are capable of achieving high tissue levels, a preferred method of treatment in most cases. Single-drug therapy using a fluoroquinolone is as effective as combination therapy utilizing fortified antibiotics. Fortified topical antibiotics to be considered for large and/or visually significant corneal infiltrates, especially if hypopyon is present. Combination fortified-antibiotic therapy is an alternative, especially for severe infection and eyes unresponsive to initial treatment, and there is no difference found in corneal perforation rates across classes of topical antibiotics. Topical corticosteroid therapy may have a beneficial role, but much of the literature has not shown a difference in clinical outcome. Subconjunctival antibiotics may be helpful where adherence is questionable or there is a delay in obtaining fortified antibiotics. For central or severe keratitis (e.g., deep stromal involvement or an infiltrate larger than 2 mm with extensive suppuration), use a loading dose (e.g., every 5 to 15 minutes), followed by frequent applications (e.g., every hour is recommended). Severe cases should be followed daily initially, at least until stable or improvement is confirmed.

### Pharmacokinetics and aqueous humor penetration of levofloxacin 1.5% and moxifloxacin 0.5% in patients undergoing cataract surgery [^115q152c]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

The primary concern of ophthalmic practitioners and surgeons is the preservation of their patients' sight. Microbial keratitis and endophthalmitis can present a substantial risk to vision and treatment must be tailored accordingly. Risk factors of microbial keratitis and endophthalmitis include contact lens wear, ocular surface disease, ocular trauma, and intraocular surgery. Corneal scarring resulting from the host immune response can also threaten sight. Therefore, clinical presentation of microbial keratitis requires aggressive treatment to eliminate infection and limit sight-threatening sequelae. Prophylaxis of endophthalmitis and effective treatment of microbial keratitis by an ophthalmic antimicrobial agent is contingent upon its ability to penetrate the cornea and aqueous. Knowledge of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of topical ophthalmic antibiotics in aqueous humor demonstrates the potential for the drugs to penetrate the corneal epithelium.

Fluoroquinolone antimicrobial agents, like levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, have in vitro activity against the bacterial pathogens that threaten the health of the eye. Levofloxacin ophthalmic solution 1.5% and moxifloxacin 0.5% are commercial compounds and have been approved in the United States for bacterial keratitis and bacterial conjunctivitis.

Moxifloxacin 0.5% is manufactured as Vigamox by Alcon, (Alcon Laboratories, Inc. Fort Worth, TX, USA). Levofloxacin 1.5% was originally manufactured by Santen, (Emeryville, CA, USA) and later Johnson and Johnson (New Brunswick, NJ, USA) but is currently distributed by a number of international pharmaceutical companies such as Centaur Pharmaceuticals (Mumbai, India), Incepta Pharmaceuticals (Dhaka, Bangladesh), and Entod Pharmaceuticals (Mumbai, India). These agents both have a dual mechanism of action that involves the inhibition of bacterial topoisomerase IV and DNA gyrase. Consequently, they are less likely to produce resistant organisms because two simultaneous mutations are required to establish resistance. Both drugs have very similar in vitro susceptibility profiles as documented in a nationwide longitudinal surveillance program that included longitudinal data from archived ocular isolates dating back to 2000.

For an antimicrobial agent to demonstrate efficacy in vivo, it must attain concentrations in the target site of both sufficient magnitude and duration of time in order to eradicate bacteria. Measures of predicted antimicrobial efficacy for fluoroquinolones include pharmacokinetic–pharmacodynamic (PK–PD) measures denoting concentration effects relative to pathogen susceptibility. Herein, we describe a study comparing the pharmacokinetics in aqueous humor of levofloxacin 1.5% and moxifloxacin 0.5% ophthalmic solutions after instillation of multiple drops into the operative eye of patients undergoing cataract surgery.

### Safety of prophylactic intracameral moxifloxacin 0.5% ophthalmic solution in cataract surgery patients [^111omtZS]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the safety of prophylactic intracameral moxifloxacin 0.5% ophthalmic solution (Vigamox) in patients having cataract surgery.

Setting

American Eye Center, Manila, Philippines.

Methods

Preoperative and 1-month postoperative anterior chamber reaction, corneal endothelial cell density, and corneal thickness were assessed in 65 eyes that had cataract surgery with intracameral moxifloxacin. All eyes received 0.1 mL intracameral moxifloxacin 0.5% ophthalmic solution containing 500 mug of moxifloxacin as the last step of phacoemulsification. Different ophthalmologists conducted the postoperative evaluation in an observer-masked fashion. A P value less than 0.05 was considered significant.

Results

All 65 eyes completed the study. The mean age was 69.5 years ± 9.13 (SD) (range 48 to 84 years). All eyes had a postoperative best corrected visual acuity of 20/30 or better. All eyes had trace to +2 cells and flare anterior chamber reaction only on the first day after surgery. The mean endothelial cell count was 2491.52 cells/mm(2) preoperatively and 2421.58 cells/mm(2) postoperatively. The mean difference was 70 cells/mm(2), which not statistically significant (P = 0.737). The increase of 17.80 microm in postoperative pachymetry 1 month after surgery was not statistically significant (P > .65).

Conclusion

Intracameral Vigamox 0.5 mg/mL appeared to be nontoxic in terms of visual rehabilitation, anterior chamber reaction, pachymetry, and corneal endothelial cell density.

### Penetration of moxifloxacin into the human aqueous humour after oral administration [^113HLVTE]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2005). Low credibility.

Aims

To determine the pharmacokinetics of moxifloxacin, a new generation fluoroquinolone, in the anterior chamber of the human uninflamed eye.

Methods

35 patients undergoing cataract surgery received two doses of 400 mg of oral moxifloxacin with a 12 hour interval and were divided into six groups. Moxifloxacin levels in aqueous humour and serum were determined by a microbiological agar well diffusion technique at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hours after the second dose in each group respectively.

Results

Mean moxifloxacin levels in the anterior chamber were 1.20 (SD 0.35) microg/ml at the 2 hours group, 1.22 (0.48) microg/ml at the 4 hours group, 1.20 (0.45) microg/ml at the 6 hours group, 1.58 (0.38) microg/ml at the 8 hours group, 1.37 (0.44) microg/ml at the 10 hours group, and 1.23 (0.55) microg/ml at the 12 hours group. The mean ratio of aqueous to serum moxifloxacin level was 38%.

Conclusion

Moxifloxacin penetrates well into the anterior chamber of the human uninflamed eye after oral administration, reaching early significant levels, which are maintained for at least 12 hours and are much higher than the MIC(90) values of Gram positive and Gram negative pathogens commonly implicated in intraocular infections with the exceptions of fluoroquinolone resistant staphylococci, MRSA, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

### Review of moxifloxacin hydrochloride ophthalmic solution in the treatment of bacterial eye infections [^112GDrLG]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2008). Low credibility.

Moxifloxacin hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 0.5% (Vigamox((R))) is the ocular formulation/adaptation of moxifloxacin. Moxifloxacin is a broad spectrum 8-methoxyfluoroquinolone which terminates bacterial growth by binding to DNA gyrase (topoisomerase II) and topoisomerase IV, essential bacterial enzymes involved in the replication, translation, repair and recombination of deoxyribonucleic acid. Affinity for both enzymes improves potency and reduces the probability of selecting resistant bacterial subpopulations. Vigamox is a bactericidal, concentration dependent, anti-infective. It is preservative free, and well tolerated with minimal ocular side effects. It provides increased penetration into ocular tissues and fluids with improved activity against Streptococci and Staphylococci species and moderate to excellent activity against clinically relevant, gram-negative ocular pathogens.

### Vitreal penetration of oral and topical moxifloxacin in humans [^114Zau65]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2007). Low credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the vitreal penetration of moxifloxacin after oral and topical administration.

Design

Prospective, nonrandomized clinical trial.

Methods

Twenty-four patients were assigned to one of four dosing groups: control (n = 3), which received no medication; oral (n = 8), which received two 400 mg oral doses of moxifloxacin before surgery; topical (n = 8), which received one drop of topical moxifloxacin 0.5% every 15 minutes for the hour preceding surgery; and combined (n = 5), which received two 400 mg oral doses and one drop of topical moxifloxacin 0.5% hourly for 18 hours prior to surgery. Vitreous samples were obtained and analyzed.

Results

Control, below quantifiable levels; oral, 1.553 ± 0.33 microg/ml; topical, 0.027 microg/ml; and combined, 2.219 ± 0.71 microg/ml. One topical patient developed postoperative endophthalmitis.

Conclusions

In contrast to topical moxifloxacin, oral moxifloxacin achieves significant levels in the noninflamed human vitreous.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for treatment of eye injuries and illnesses in the wilderness: 2024 update [^112EQ8jW]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Corneal ulcers — recognition and initial wilderness management prioritize emergent care, culture when near expert evaluation, and empiric fluoroquinolone therapy when far from care, with explicit dosing instructions and evacuation. Signs include significant pain, white or gray corneal infiltrate, and an epithelial defect on fluorescein exam; emergent treatment is important, and contact lenses must be discontinued. If the patient is within 1–3 h of an ophthalmologist's evaluation, we recommend the ophthalmologist obtain a culture before initiating treatment; if more than a few hours from expert evaluation, we recommend beginning empiric antibiotic treatment with fourth-generation fluoroquinolone eye drops, such as moxifloxacin 0.5%, loading by instilling 1 drop every 5 min for the first 30 min, then 1 drop every 30 min for 6 h, followed by 1 drop every hour until seen. Oral fluoroquinolones are warranted if nothing else is available (such as moxifloxacin, 400 mg daily for 7 days), and cycloplegic medication (such as atropine 1%, 1 drop every 8 h) can be given; evacuation should be emergent. Recommendation grades include: Antibiotics, topical — Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence; Antibiotics, systemic — Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence; Cycloplegic — Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence; Evacuation — Strong recommendation, low-quality evidence.

### Pharmacokinetics and aqueous humor penetration of levofloxacin 1.5% and moxifloxacin 0.5% in patients undergoing cataract surgery [^116Cyxpv]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

The objective of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetics of levofloxacin 1.5% and moxifloxacin hydrochloride 0.5% ophthalmic solutions in aqueous humor after multiple doses prior to cataract surgery.

Methods

Ninety-eight eyes underwent cataract surgery and met the requirements of PK analysis. Eligible eyes were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive levofloxacin or moxifloxacin prior to cataract surgery and were randomized into one of four sampling time points (ie, 1, 2, 4, and 6 hour post-last dose). Randomization was investigator and laboratory-masked. Three days prior to cataract surgery, each patient instilled one drop of the assigned study medication into the operative eye four times daily. One aqueous humor specimen was collected from the eye at the randomized time point. Aqueous humor specimens were assayed for drug concentration using a validated liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometer.

Results

Concentrations of the drug in the aqueous humor, as described by mean C max and pooled AUC 0–6 values, were greater for levofloxacin than moxifloxacin (C max: 1.43, 0.87 μg/ml, respectively, P = 0.008; AUC 0–6 6.1, 3.8 μg·min/ml, P < 0.001 respectively). No treatment-emergent adverse events were reported.

Conclusion

Significantly greater drug exposures were attained in aqueous humor following the administration of levofloxacin 1.5% than moxifloxacin 0.5% ophthalmic solution. Achieving considerable higher drug concentration in the aqueous humor with levofloxacin 1.5% may demonstrate a greater potential for bacterial eradication.

### Intracameral vigamox (moxifloxacin 0.5%) is non-toxic and effective in preventing endophthalmitis in a rabbit model [^114dFGGn]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine whether Vigamox (moxifloxacin 0.5% ophthalmic solution) can be safely injected intracamerally to prevent Staphylococcus aureus endophthalmitis in a rabbit model.

Design

Animal study.

Methods

The safety and bactericidal-effectiveness of Vigamox were evaluated in three stages using 189 New Zealand White rabbits. (Stage 1) The toxicity of two intravitreal doses of Vigamox (moxifloxacin 500, 250 microg) was compared with vancomycin (1 mg) and saline. (Stage 2) A reproducible rabbit model of Staphylococcus aureus endophthalmitis was established. (Stage 3) The bactericidal effect of intracameral Vigamox (moxifloxacin 500, 250, 125, 50 microg) was compared with vancomycin (1 mg) and saline. Intracameral antibiotic therapy commenced immediately after Staphylococcus aureus intravitreal challenge (5000 cfu). Toxicity was evaluated by masked clinical examination using a slit-lamp, an indirect ophthalmoscope, and corneal-ultrasound pachymetry. The clinical examination included the exterior eye, cornea, anterior chamber, vitreous, and retina. The presentations were graded on a severity scale of 0, 0.5, 1, 2, and 3. The bactericidal efficacy was determined using intracameral colony counts.

Results

In the toxicity studies without bacterial challenge, the clinical scores of rabbits injected intracamerally with Vigamox were statistically equivalent to rabbits given intracameral vancomycin or saline. In the efficacy studies, eyes treated intravitreally with Vigamox, at all doses, or vancomycin were negative for Staphylococcus aureus and nontreated controls remained culture-positive.

Conclusions

Vigamox appears to be nontoxic for intracameral injection and effective in preventing experimental endophthalmitis in the rabbit model. Further studies will determine the clinical role of intracameral Vigamox for surgical prophylaxis and postoperative therapy.

### Conjunctival tissue pharmacokinetic properties of topical azithromycin 1% and moxifloxacin 0.5% ophthalmic solutions: a single-dose, randomized, open-label, active-controlled trial in healthy adult volunteers [^113Jmsy1]. Clinical Therapeutics (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Effective ocular tissue concentrations and prolonged residence times of antibacterial agents are important in treating both acute and chronic diseases. Conjunctival biopsy allows the determination of specific tissue concentration data for topical ophthalmic agents. Drug concentration analysis at various time points following instillation allows interpretation of the residence time and a rationale for dosing frequency.

Objective

This study compared the pharmacokinetic parameters of 2 currently available topical ocular antibiotics-azithromycin ophthalmic solution 1% and moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5%-in the conjunctiva of healthy volunteers after a single topical administration.

Methods

This single-dose, randomized, open-label, active-controlled clinical trial was conducted at ORA Clinical Research and Development, North Andover, Massachusetts. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of azithromycin or moxifloxacin and to undergo biopsy sampling at 30 minutes or 2, 12, or 24 hours after administration. Concentrations of azithromycin and moxifloxacin were determined using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Adverse events (AEs) were assessed at all visits using visual acuity measurements, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and direct questioning.

Results

Forty-eight subjects (mean age, 40.0 years; 48% female; 96% white, 2% black, and 2% Asian) underwent conjunctival biopsy. Mean (SD) concentrations of azithromycin in conjunctival tissue (lower limit of quantitation [LLOQ], 1 microg/g for 1-mg biopsy specimen) were 131 (89), 59 (19), 48 (24), and 32 (20) microg/g at 30 minutes and 2, 12, and 24 hours, respectively (median values, 117, 69, 46, and 30 microg/g). Mean concentrations concentrations of moxifloxacin in conjunctival tissue (LLOQ, 0.05 microg/g for 1-mg biopsy sample) were 1.92 (2.03), 3.77 (8.98), 0.02 (0.04), and 0.01 (0.02) microg/g at 30 minutes and 2, 12, and 24 hours, respectively (median values, 1.12, 0.12, < 0.05, and < 0.05 microg/g). Thirteen subjects (6 in the azithromycin group and 7 in the moxifloxacin group) experienced 20 AEs, 11 of which were considered possibly related to study treatment, and 15 of which were ocular (most commonly conjunctival hemorrhage).

Conclusions

In this single-dose study of 2 currently available topical ocular antibiotics in healthy volunteers, therapeutic concentrations were achieved with both agents. Both treatments were well tolerated in the population studied. Clinical Trials Identification Number: NCT00564447.

### Topical prophylaxis with moxifloxacin prevents endophthalmitis in a rabbit model [^111mUbsp]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

The prophylaxis potential of the topical antibiotic, 0.5% moxifloxacin (Vigamox), was evaluated to prevent endophthalmitis after bacterial anterior chamber challenge in a rabbit model.

Design

An in vivo laboratory investigation.

Methods

Three regimens of topical 0.5% moxifloxacin were tested for prophylaxis to prevent endophthalmitis: (1) (full prophylaxis) moxifloxacin drops every 15 minutes for 1 hour (five drops), anterior chamber challenge with 5 x 10(4) colony-forming units of Staphylococcus aureus, one drop of moxifloxacin, and four more drops applied over the next 24 hours; (2) (preprophylaxis) prechallenge prophylaxis, S. aureus challenge, and no postchallenge prophylaxis; and (3) (postprophylaxis) no prechallenge prophylaxis, S. aureus challenge, and postchallenge prophylaxis. A saline control was tested concurrently in all three experiments. At 24 hours after injection, the eyes were evaluated by slit lamp in a masked fashion for clinical signs of endophthalmitis, and the anterior and posterior chambers were cultured for bacteria.

Results

The median clinical scores for the moxifloxacin group were significantly lower than the saline group for all three treatment regimens. The median clinical score for the full prophylaxis regimen was significantly lower than the preprophylaxis and postprophylaxis regimens alone. The anterior and posterior chambers were negative for S. aureus in all three moxifloxacin treatment regimens.

Conclusions

In a rabbit model, a "proof of principle" was demonstrated that topical antibiotic therapy pre- and postintraocular bacterial challenge could prevent bacterial endophthalmitis. Surgical prophylaxis with topical 0.5% moxifloxacin (Vigamox) may prove to be a valuable adjunct for the prevention of endophthalmitis.

### Dose and administration of intracameral moxifloxacin for prophylaxis of postoperative endophthalmitis [^111ovbkV]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

To review current and past practices of intracameral antibiotic administration for infection prophylaxis in cataract surgery; to review the benefits and liabilities of available prophylactic drugs, dosage determination, and administration protocols; and to devise an optimum dose and administration protocol for intracameral moxifloxacin.

Setting

Humber River Hospital and the University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Design

Retrospective evaluation of treatment modality.

Methods

This study consisted of a detailed review of the history, drugs, and methods of intracameral prophylaxis and microbiological and pharmacodynamics analysis of options. A review of potential drug sources and doses was performed and 1 drug, dose, and administration protocol was selected. The current method's adoption reasons are described followed by the authors' experience.

Results

A single infection in 3430 cases occurred with a moxifloxacin-resistant strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis when moxifloxacin 100 mcg in 0.1 mL was used. Increasing the dose and changing the administration technique resulted in no infections in 4601 cases and no detrimental side effects or complications.

Conclusion

Intracameral moxifloxacin prepared by dilution of 3 cc moxifloxacin 0.5% (Vigamox) with 7 cc balanced salt solution and with the administration of 0.3 to 0.4 cc (450 to 600 mcg.) as the final step in cataract surgery via the side port after the main incision has been sealed and hydrated showed advantages over alternative intracameral antibiotic prophylactic methods, with minimum risk.

### Aqueous humour penetration of moxifloxocin and gatifloxacin eye drops in different dosing regimens before phacoemulsification surgery [^111bV2F8]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2011). Low credibility.

Aim

To compare the aqueous humour penetration of moxifloxacin 0.5% and gatifloxacin 0.3% eye drops administered in two different dosing regimens during phacoemulsification surgery.

Methods

This prospective, randomised study included 97 patients. The patients were randomly divided into two treatment groups to receive either moxifloxacin or gatifloxacin. All patients received the topical antibiotics four times per day for 2 days prior to surgery. Patients in each group were further subdivided to receive additional doses of antibiotic drops as two drops 30 min apart (subgroup 1) versus four drops 10 min apart (subgroup 2) 1 h prior to the surgery. At the beginning of surgery, 0.1 mL of aqueous humour was aspirated, and the concentrations of moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography.

Results

The mean concentrations of moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin in the aqueous humour were 0.72 ± 0.40 μg/ml and 0.47 ± 0.29 μg/ml, respectively, in the first subgroup, and 1.95 ± 1.05 μg/ml and 0.77 ± 0.52 μg/ml, respectively, in the second subgroup. Both the inter-group (p = 0.006 and p = 0.000, respectively) and the intra-group (p = 0.000 and p = 0.035, respectively) differences between the aqueous humour concentrations of moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin subgroups were statistically significant.

Conclusion

Moxifloxacin, given in the same dosage, penetrated the aqueous humour better then gatifloxacin during cataract surgery. The penetration of both antibiotics increased significantly when the dosage of the agent was doubled.

Treatments and sample collection

Subjects were screened for enrollment at Visit 1 only after providing written informed consent, at which time demographic data, medical history, and medication history were recorded. An undilated slit-lamp biomicroscopy examination was performed to examine both eyes for tissue abnormalities or other ocular disease. To avoid bias, a computer-generated list of randomized numbers was used in the assignment of eligible subjects to treatment with besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% or moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5% in a 1:1 ratio. Subjects self-administered one drop of study drug into the surgical eye "quater in die" or QID (four times a day; 8 am, 12 pm, 4 pm, and 8 pm) for 3 days before surgery and recorded each dose administered in a diary. On the day of surgery, subjects received a single drop of the assigned study medication in their nonsurgical eye 1 hour before surgery. Subjects who reported missing any dose of study medication were discontinued from the study.

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk Summary

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies with moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution in pregnant women to inform any drug-associated risks.

Oral administration of moxifloxacin to pregnant rats and monkeys and intravenously to pregnant rabbits during the period of organogenesis did not produce adverse maternal or fetal effects at clinically relevant doses. Oral administration of moxifloxacin to pregnant rats during late gestation through lactation did not produce adverse maternal, fetal or neonatal effects at clinically relevant doses (see Data).

Data

Animal Data

Embryo-fetal studies were conducted in pregnant rats administered with 20, 100, or 500 mg/kg/day moxifloxacin by oral gavage on Gestation Days 6 to 17, to target the period of organogenesis. Decreased fetal body weight and delayed skeletal development were observed at 500 mg/kg/day [277 times the human area under the curve (AUC) at the recommended human ophthalmic dose]. The No-Observed-Adverse-Effect-Level (NOAEL) for developmental toxicity was 100 mg/kg/day (30 times the human AUC at the recommended human ophthalmic dose).

Embryo-fetal studies were conducted in pregnant rabbits administered with 2, 6.5, or 20 mg/kg/day moxifloxacin by intravenous administration on Gestation Days 6 to 20, to target the period of organogenesis. Abortions, increased incidence of fetal malformations, delayed fetal skeletal ossification, and reduced placental and fetal body weights were observed at 20 mg/kg/ day (1086 times the human AUC at the recommended human ophthalmic dose), a dose that produced maternal body weight loss and death. The NOAEL for developmental toxicity was 6.5 mg/ kg/day (246 times the human AUC at the recommended human ophthalmic dose).

In two randomized, double-masked, multicenter, controlled clinical trials in which patients were dosed 3 times a day for 4 days, moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution produced clinical cures on Day 5 to 6 in 66% to 69% of patients treated for bacterial conjunctivitis. Microbiological success rates for the eradication of baseline pathogens ranged from 84% to 94%.

In a randomized, double-masked, multicenter, parallel-group clinical trial of pediatric patients with bacterial conjunctivitis between birth and 31 days of age, patients were dosed with moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution or another anti-infective agent. Clinical outcomes for the trial demonstrated a clinical cure rate of 80% at Day 9 and a microbiological eradication success rate of 92% at Day 9.

Please note that microbiologic eradication does not always correlate with clinical outcome in anti-infective trials.

### Efficacy and safety of prophylactic simultaneous intravitreal moxifloxacin injection with standard intravitreal anti-VEGF injection procedure in cases of cystoid macular edema and macular neovascularization [^111ETzMT]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

The technique of intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF was standardized in all eyes in which; after topical anesthesia, the lids and the eye were prepped with povidone iodine 5%, eyelid speculum was inserted, and an 0.05 mL anti-VEGF agent was injected at 3.5–4 mm from the limbus according to the lens status of the injected eye. For eyes injected on day A, an additional intravitreal injection using the same technique was performed with 0.05 mL of commercially available Vigamox (moxifloxacin 0.5% eyedrops, Alcon) through a separate distinct pars plana site. This is equal to a dose of 0.25 mg (250 ug) of moxifloxacin. However, cases injected on day A and day B received a postoperative course of topical moxifloxacin 0.5% QID and prednisolone acetate 1% eye drops QID for 1 week. Perfusion of the optic nerve was assessed in all eyes by testing for hand-motion vision immediately after injection and anterior chamber paracentesis was performed in eyes with less than hand-motion vision to reduce intraocular pressure. Full ophthalmic assessment of the anterior segment and posterior segment was done to exclude toxic reactions or post-injection endophthalmitis on day 1 and day 3 after injection. Final best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was assed using Snellen visual acuity charts and converted to LogMAR for statistical purposes and macular OCT imaging were obtained serially over 3 months after the 1st injection in both groups to address changes in retinal thickness and microstructure and to assess response to treatment. All OCT images were acquired using Optovue Avanti OCT/OCTA, with central macular thickness measured automatically from the internal limiting membrane to the retinal pigment epithelium.

Introduction

Bacterial endophthalmitis is a rare but potentially vision-threatening complication of cataract surgery. The most common causes of bacterial endophthalmitis are gram-positive organisms, often originating from resident bacterial flora on the conjunctiva and/or eyelids, which penetrate the eye during surgery or following surgery through the incision. Accordingly, the most frequently isolated organisms from culture-proven cases of postoperative endophthalmitis are coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), most notably Staphylococcus epidermidis,–also the most prevalent organism of the ocular flora in these patients.–While the previously published European Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgeons (ESCRS) study established the efficacy of intraoperative, intracameral antibiotics in the prophylaxis against infection following cataract surgery, topical perioperative antibiotics, most often fluoroquinolones, remain a standard of care for prophylaxis against endophthalmitis in the US.–However, cases of endophthalmitis due to fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates have begun to emerge.–

Besifloxacin, a chlorinated fluoroquinolone, is the latest-generation topical fluoroquinolone with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, including activity against drug-resistant staphylococci,–comparable to that of vancomycin. Besifloxacin was developed for ophthalmic use only and has been reported to have potent and balanced activity against DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Both of these features have been suggested to reduce the potential for resistance development. Approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis, like other topical fluoroquinolone formulations, besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% (Besivance ®; Bausch and Lomb, Tampa, FL, USA) has been used perioperatively for prophylaxis against endophthalmitis.

The objective of this study was to investigate the ocular bacterial flora in patients scheduled to undergo cataract surgery and to compare the antibacterial efficacy of besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension 0.6% with that of moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0.5% (Vigamox ®, Alcon Laboratories, Inc, Fort Worth, TX, USA) in decreasing the bacterial load on lid margins and conjunctiva of these patients following two different preoperative dosing regimens. Moxifloxacin was chosen as a comparator because it is often used for prophylaxis in the surgical setting and has been described as a preferred option. We also determined the in vitro susceptibility of ocular bacterial isolates from these patients to besifloxacin, moxifloxacin, and a broad range of other antibacterials.

### Effect of topical antibiotics on duration of acute infective conjunctivitis in children: a randomized clinical trial and a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115Zar2H]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Participants, Randomization, and Blinding in the RCT

Children aged 6 months to 7 years with a clinical diagnosis of acute infective conjunctivitis were eligible for enrollment. Acute infective conjunctivitis was defined as the presence of conjunctival inflammation (erythema), discharge, or soreness or swelling of the eyelids. The exclusion criteria were allergy to fluoroquinolones, antibiotic therapy 7 days prior to the study, severe infection, allergic conjunctivitis, a trauma, or a foreign body in the eye. All the children were from Finnish-speaking families.

The eligible children were randomized to receive moxifloxacin eye drops, placebo eye drops, or no intervention in a 1:1:1 ratio. A biostatistician created a randomization list in permuted blocks of 6 in a random order, and the results were enclosed in sealed, numbered opaque envelopes containing either a code for the study group or the words no treatment. After informed consent had been obtained, the study physician opened the envelope and revealed a code (A or B) or no treatment.

The participating children, their parents, and the physicians and nurses were blinded to the assignment of the moxifloxacin and placebo eye drop groups, while the study design for the no intervention group was randomized but unblinded. The pharmacy distributed the eye drops and instructions to the families in opaque cardboard boxes in which the moxifloxacin eye drops were packed in plastic bottles and the placebo eye drops in single-dose vials. Both the bottles and the vials were transparent and did not have labels.

RCT Procedures

Conjunctival and nasopharyngeal specimens subjected to respiratory pathogen polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and bacterial culture were obtained from the participants, and detailed descriptions of these microbiological samples are available in the study protocol (Supplement 1). The participants in the eye drop groups received either moxifloxacin eye drops (5 mg/mL [Novartis Finland]) or placebo eye drops (carboxymethylcellulose sodium, 1.0% [Allergan Pharmaceuticals Ireland]) administered as 1 drop in each affected eye 3 times daily until conjunctival symptoms were absent for at least 24 hours. The maximum duration of treatment was 7 days. The placebo eye drops used in the trial did not contain preservatives. All parents, including those in the no intervention group, were advised to remove any discharge from the child's eyes at least 3 times a day. Moxifloxacin eye drops were started in a nonblinded manner as a rescue treatment if needed.

### Prophylactic intracameral levofloxacin in cataract surgery-an evaluation of safety [^112MTaBP]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2017). Low credibility.

Moxifloxacin (Vigamox; Novartis International AG, Basel, Switzerland) is available as a self-preserved commercial ophthalmic formulation that requires no special preparation for intracameral delivery, thus reducing the risk of dilution errors. It is less extensively studied, but it is a fourth-generation fluoroquinolone that covers a broad spectrum of organisms and hence is effective in preventing postsurgical infection. The safety of intracameral moxifloxacin was confirmed in 2007 by the authors of the current article. We injected 0.1 mL of moxifloxacin 0.5% solution or an equivalent of 0.5 mg moxifloxacin into the capsular bag at the conclusion of surgery. Intracameral moxifloxacin was nontoxic by parameters of visual rehabilitation, anterior chamber reaction, pachymetry, and corneal endothelial cell density. These results align with those from the current study, as no toxicities were observed with the use of intracameral levofloxacin.

Reservations exist toward the routine prophylactic use of fourth-generation fluoroquinolones, such as moxifloxacin. Some health care providers prefer to withhold moxifloxacin unless required for specific treatment, and infectious disease authorities have expressed concern related to the growing resistance to antibiotics and discourage its use for prophylaxis.

Schimel et alreported that for Gram-positive organisms, there was only 47% susceptibility to moxifloxacin, and they did not note the susceptibility of Gram-negative organisms. They did, however, find that Gram-positive organisms had a 58.5% susceptibility rate to levofloxacin, while Gram-negative organisms demonstrated 100% susceptibility. It is important to recognize that although Gram-positive organisms are still the most common, series have been reported, including a Singapore study that evaluated Asian eyes, that Gram-negative organisms comprise a bigger proportion of isolates (25%) compared to Western studies.

### Comparison of 2 moxifloxacin regimens for preoperative prophylaxis: prospective randomized triple-masked trial. part 2: residual conjunctival flora [^115UFXYE]. Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine whether a regimen of topical moxifloxacin hydrochloride ophthalmic solution 0.5% (Vigamox) administered on the day of cataract surgery reduces conjunctival bacterial flora.

Setting

Iladevi Cataract & IOL Research Centre, Ahmedabad, India.

Methods

Seventy-four patients were prospectively randomized to receive Vigamox 4 times 1 day before surgery plus 1 drop 2 hours preoperatively (Group 1) and 74 patients, to receive Vigamox 2 hours before surgery and every 15 minutes in the first hour only (Group 2). Conjunctival swabs from the upper and lower lid margins and lower fornix were taken before and after Vigamox instillation. Aliquots were spread on chocolate blood, anaerobic basal, and nutrient agars. The number of bacterial colony-forming units (CFU) on the plates was counted with a grid technique and expressed as log values. The total number of CFU per eye and mean percentage reduction in CFU after instillation were calculated. Bacterial species were identified using biochemical and biophysical reactions. Wilcoxon signed ranked and Mann-Whitney tests and multiple linear regression were applied.

Results

In Group 1, the median colony count decreased from 1284.00 CFU ± 643.18 (SD) before Vigamox instillation to 65.00 ± 72.61 CFU after instillation (93.12% reduction) (P < .001) and in Group 2, from 1634.00 ± 769.27 CFU to 75.00 ± 81.23 CFU (93.28% reduction) (P < .001). The percentage reduction after instillation was similar between the 2 groups (P = 0.09).

Conclusion

Both Vigamox regimens reduced the number of CFU of conjunctival flora, indicating that instillation beginning on the day of surgery is effective.
