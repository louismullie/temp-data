## Question

HRT recommendations for women and delaying menopause

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about hormone replacement therapy (HRT) recommendations for women, specifically regarding timing, duration, risks, and whether HRT can delay menopause. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about precise definitions of menopause and the perimenopausal window. Then, I should verify the core indications for HRT and what it can and cannot do. Next, I will examine the timing hypothesis and age/time-since-menopause thresholds. After that, I need to review formulation choices, dosing, and route, including uterine protection. I will then assess risks, including breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and venous thromboembolism, and how they vary by timing and regimen. I should confirm duration policies and discontinuation strategies. I will also consider special populations such as premature ovarian insufficiency, surgical menopause, and those with cancer risk. Finally, I will synthesize practical recommendations and directly answer whether HRT can delay menopause, ensuring I anchor each point to guidelines and key trials.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: menopause is defined retrospectively after 12 months of amenorrhea, with a median age around 51 years, and perimenopause is the several-year transition with cycle variability and vasomotor symptoms. Importantly, HRT does not reverse or delay the biological event of menopause itself, it only treats symptoms and consequences of estrogen deficiency, so I need to be careful not to conflate symptom control with altering the menopausal transition timeline.

> Next, I should review the core indications. The primary, evidence-based reasons to use systemic HRT are moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms and genitourinary syndrome of menopause; HRT is also effective for prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis in appropriately selected women, but it is not indicated for primary prevention of chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, dementia, or diabetes, and I should explicitly state that to avoid misinterpretation [^111ioqqJ] [^115TEqN9] [^112RSuzA] [^115L7xX8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal rules on timing. I need to check the timing hypothesis. The best benefit–risk profile emerges when HRT is initiated in women younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, with age-stratified WHI analyses and subsequent meta-analyses showing more favorable cardiovascular and mortality signals in this window, whereas initiation later tends to carry higher absolute risks; this is the cornerstone of most guideline-concordant prescribing [^111g5hPA] [^111ZZbUb] [^111yvUiD] [^111ioqqJ].

> I will now examine formulation and route, because these materially affect risk. For women with a uterus, combined estrogen–progestogen therapy is required to mitigate endometrial cancer risk; for women without a uterus, estrogen alone is appropriate. Transdermal estrogen is preferred when venous thromboembolism risk is a concern because it avoids first-pass hepatic effects and is associated with lower thrombotic risk than oral preparations; micronized progesterone is favored over synthetic progestins when a progestogen is needed, given a more favorable risk profile, and I should double-check that these are consistent with endocrine and menopause society guidance [^115TNphx] [^1178U8Q1] [^1146ThMd] [^111q3rop].

> Let me consider dosing principles next. The mantra is to use the lowest effective dose individualized to symptom control, with upward titration based on response. Ultra-low systemic doses can be effective for some women, and routine estradiol level monitoring is not generally required unless symptoms persist despite dose changes or switching routes, which aligns with endocrine and menopause society recommendations [^1167czKD] [^1134k2WV].

> Now, I should review duration and discontinuation, and I need to ensure I separate population-level cautions from individualized care. Many guidelines advise periodic reassessment at least annually, targeting the shortest total duration consistent with goals, yet acknowledge that some women will benefit from longer use. For estrogen–progestin therapy, breast cancer risk becomes detectable after about 3–5 years, whereas estrogen alone did not show increased breast cancer risk up to 7 years in WHI, and extended use beyond 65 may be reasonable in select, well-counseled women with persistent symptoms or fracture risk, with mitigation strategies such as dose reduction, transdermal route, and safer progestogens [^1169oVcS] [^114UWJ1K] [^114vNTEq] [^114dh9sV].

> Wait, let me verify the discontinuation details because patients often ask how to stop. There is no definitive evidence favoring abrupt versus tapered discontinuation, but expert consensus favors gradual tapering to reduce rebound vasomotor symptoms, which occur in roughly half of women after stopping. Shared decision-making about taper pace and symptom management during withdrawal is recommended [^114vNTEq] [^111k5BjJ] [^112qfBPr].

> I need to ensure I quantify and contextualize risks. Breast cancer risk is low but real with combined therapy, on the order of less than one additional case per 1,000 women per year, rising with duration. Estrogen alone carries a lower and delayed risk signal, and risk should be framed alongside modifiable lifestyle risks such as alcohol and obesity. Cardiovascular risks, including venous thromboembolism and ischemic stroke, are higher with oral estrogen and increase with age and time since menopause, whereas transdermal estrogen mitigates VTE risk. Absolute risks are lower in younger women close to menopause, reinforcing the timing principle [^111P6Njs] [^1172uJCe] [^111ioqqJ] [^1178U8Q1].

> But wait, what about special populations? I should confirm guidance for early menopause and POI. Women with premature ovarian insufficiency or early menopause should generally be offered HRT until the average age of natural menopause, both for symptom control and for long-term bone and cardiovascular health, with individualized reassessment thereafter; this is a strong, consistent recommendation across endocrine and gynecologic guidelines [^116eCmNr] [^113Df5XT] [^113xGSvt] [^112JyAtk].

> I should also review surgical menopause and cancer risk contexts. After bilateral oophorectomy, estrogen-only therapy is appropriate if the uterus is absent; in women with elevated breast cancer risk or BRCA mutations, systemic HRT is generally avoided, though some guidelines allow individualized consideration after risk-reducing mastectomy, and after endometrial cancer, HRT may be discussed case-by-case post-hysterectomy with low- to intermediate-risk disease; for breast cancer survivors, systemic estrogen is not routinely recommended, though some may accept off-label use after shared decision-making, and vaginal estrogen for GSM is often acceptable with counseling [^113bk3sm] [^113LCxsY] [^114gS8rC] [^115TNphx].

> Let me synthesize practical recommendations while I double-check alignment with major guidelines. Initiate systemic HRT primarily for bothersome vasomotor symptoms or GSM unresponsive to nonhormonal measures, favoring initiation under age 60 or within 10 years of menopause; use estrogen alone if the uterus is absent and estrogen plus a progestogen if the uterus is present, prefer transdermal estrogen when thrombotic risk is a concern, and choose micronized progesterone when feasible; start low and titrate to the lowest effective dose, reassess annually, and individualize duration, with extended use acceptable in select older women using risk-mitigation strategies; for GSM, prioritize low-dose vaginal estrogen or nonhormonal options when systemic therapy is not indicated [^111g5hPA] [^111ioqqJ] [^1178U8Q1] [^1157hBxF].

> Finally, I should directly answer the question about delaying menopause. HRT does not delay the biological onset of menopause. It replaces hormones after ovarian function declines and thereby treats symptoms and prevents sequelae such as bone loss, but the menopausal transition occurs irrespective of HRT use, so I need to be explicit that symptom relief should not be misconstrued as postponing menopause itself.

HRT is indicated for **vasomotor symptoms** and **osteoporosis prevention** in women under 60 or within 10 years of menopause, with the most favorable benefit–risk balance when started early [^111g5hPA] [^111ZZbUb]. It is **not recommended for primary prevention of chronic conditions** or for delaying menopause [^1138Y254] [^112RSuzA]. Use the **lowest effective dose** for the shortest duration, with annual reassessment and shared decision-making [^1169oVcS] [^112TXcrr]. HRT does not delay menopause; it only alleviates symptoms and may be continued until the average age of menopause in early menopause or POI [^113Df5XT] [^112JyAtk].

---

## Indications for HRT

HRT is **primarily indicated** for the following clinical scenarios:

- **Vasomotor symptoms**: Hot flashes, night sweats, and related sleep disturbances [^111ioqqJ] [^115TEqN9].
- **Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM)**: Vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and urinary symptoms [^111ioqqJ] [^111yvUiD].
- **Osteoporosis prevention**: Particularly in women at high risk of fractures [^111yvUiD].

---

## Timing and duration of HRT

The timing of HRT initiation significantly influences its **benefit-risk profile**. Current guidelines recommend initiating HRT in women younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset, as this window offers the most favorable balance of benefits and risks [^111g5hPA] [^113scWk6]. For **early menopause or primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)**, HRT is recommended until the average age of natural menopause (approximately 51 years) [^113Df5XT] [^112JyAtk]. For **duration**, use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration necessary, with annual reassessment of ongoing need and risks [^1169oVcS] [^1126w15K].

---

## Risks and benefits of HRT

HRT has a complex risk–benefit profile that varies with age, timing, and individual health factors:

| **Benefits** | **Risks** |
|-|-|
| Effective relief of vasomotor symptoms [^111ioqqJ] | Increased risk of breast cancer with long-term use, particularly with combined estrogen-progestin therapy [^1172uJCe] |
| Improvement in quality of life and sexual function [^notfound] | Increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), especially with oral estrogen [^1178U8Q1] |
| Prevention of osteoporosis and fractures [^111ioqqJ] | Slight increase in stroke risk, particularly in older women [^111ioqqJ] |
| Potential cardiovascular benefits when initiated early (timing hypothesis) [^111ZZbUb] | Increased risk of endometrial cancer if estrogen is used without progestogen in women with an intact uterus [^1146ThMd] |

---

## Individualized patient assessment

Before initiating HRT, a **comprehensive individualized assessment** is essential, including:

- **Age and time since menopause**: Younger women or those within 10 years of menopause generally have a more favorable risk-benefit profile [^111g5hPA] [^113scWk6].
- **Cardiovascular and breast cancer risk**: Baseline risk assessment is critical in guiding therapy selection and duration [^112PurCg] [^113fU5gr].
- **Patient preferences and symptoms**: Shared decision-making is essential to align treatment with patient goals and symptom severity [^112TXcrr] [^114dwtC8].

---

## Alternative therapies and lifestyle modifications

For women who cannot or prefer not to use HRT, **alternative therapies** and lifestyle modifications include:

- **Non-hormonal medications**: SSRIs, SNRIs, gabapentin, and clonidine for vasomotor symptoms [^1178U8Q1] [^1167Tqjo].
- **Lifestyle modifications**: Regular exercise, weight management, smoking cessation, and alcohol moderation [^notfound].
- **Complementary therapies**: Acupuncture, mindfulness, and cognitive-behavioral therapy may provide symptom relief for some women [^notfound].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines from major medical societies, including the North American Menopause Society (NAMS), the Endocrine Society, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), consistently recommend:

- **Initiate HRT** in women younger than 60 years or within 10 years of menopause onset for symptom relief and osteoporosis prevention [^111g5hPA] [^113scWk6].
- **Use the lowest effective dose** for the shortest duration necessary, with annual reassessment [^1169oVcS] [^117Ky3uP].
- **Individualize therapy** based on patient-specific risk factors, preferences, and symptom severity [^112TXcrr] [^112dsQ7T].

---

## Does HRT delay menopause?

HRT **does not delay menopause**; menopause is defined by the permanent cessation of menstrual periods, and HRT merely alleviates symptoms associated with estrogen deficiency. In women experiencing early menopause or POI, HRT is recommended until the average age of natural menopause (approximately 51 years) to mitigate long-term health risks associated with prolonged estrogen deficiency [^113Df5XT] [^112JyAtk].

---

HRT is effective for **vasomotor symptoms** and **osteoporosis prevention** in women under 60 or within 10 years of menopause, but is not recommended for primary prevention of chronic conditions or for delaying menopause. Therapy should be individualized, using the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration, with annual reassessment and shared decision-making.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^114dh9sV]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy — extended use after age 65 years: There is no general rule for stopping systemic hormone therapy in a woman aged 65 years, and although the Beers criteria warns against hormone therapy in women aged older than 65 years, the recommendation to routinely discontinue systemic hormone therapy in women aged 65 years and older is neither cited or supported by evidence nor is it recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists or The North American Menopause Society. For otherwise healthy women with persistent vasomotor symptoms (VMS), continuing hormone therapy beyond age 65 years is a reasonable option with appropriate counseling, regular assessment of risks and benefits, and shared decision-making, and hormone therapy also may be considered for prevention of fracture in healthy older women at elevated fracture risk when bothersome VMS persist or when hormone therapy remains the best choice because of lack of efficacy or intolerance of other fracture-prevention therapies; however, long-duration hormone therapy use and use in older women is not appropriate for reduction in the risk of CHD or dementia, and mitigation strategies include switching from oral to transdermal hormone therapy, choice of progestogen, and lowering of dose.

### Role of hormone therapy in the management of menopause [^114ExMCw]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2010). Low credibility.

There are many options available to address the quality of life and health concerns of menopausal women. The principal indication for hormone therapy (HT) is the treatment of vasomotor symptoms, and benefits generally outweigh risks for healthy women with bothersome symptoms who elect HT at the time of menopause. Although HT increases the risk of coronary heart disease, recent analyses confirm that this increased risk occurs principally in older women and those a number of years beyond menopause. These findings do not support a role for HT in the prevention of heart disease but provide reassurance regarding the safety of use for hot flushes and night sweats in otherwise healthy women at the menopausal transition. An increased risk of breast cancer with extended use is another reason short-term treatment is advised. Hormone therapy prevents and treats osteoporosis but is rarely used solely for this indication. If only vaginal symptoms are present, low-dose local estrogen therapy is preferred. Contraindications to HT use include breast or endometrial cancer, cardiovascular disease, thromboembolic disorders, and active liver disease. Alternatives to HT should be advised for women with or at increased risk for these disorders. The lowest effective estrogen dose should be provided for the shortest duration necessary because risks increase with increasing age, time since menopause, and duration of use. Women must be informed of the potential benefits and risks of all therapeutic options, and care should be individualized, based on a woman's medical history, needs, and preferences.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^1157hBxF]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

NAMS position statement — risk mitigation, monitoring, and continuation of hormone therapy in older women emphasizes that mitigation of risk through use of the lowest effective dose and potentially with a nonoral route of administration becomes increasingly important as women age and with longer duration of therapy, and that longer durations or extended use beyond age 65 should include periodic reevaluation of comorbidities with consideration of periodic trials of lowering or discontinuing hormone therapy. In the absence of contraindications, a woman should determine her preferred hormone therapy formulation, dose, and duration of use, with ongoing assessment and shared decision-making with her healthcare professional, and it remains an individual decision in select, well-counseled women aged older than 60 or 65 years to continue therapy, with no data to support routine discontinuation in women aged 65 years. For women with GSM, low-dose vaginal ET may be considered for use at any age and for extended duration, if needed.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)/American College of Endocrinology (ACE) Position Statement is designed to update the previous menopause clinical practice guidelines published in 2011 but does not replace them. The current document reviews new clinical trials published since then as well as new information regarding possible risks and benefits of therapies available for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. AACE reinforces the recommendations made in its previous guidelines and provides additional recommendations on the basis of new data. A summary regarding this position statement is listed below: New information available from randomized clinical trials and epidemiologic studies reported after 2011 was critically reviewed. No previous recommendations from the 2011 menopause clinical practice guidelines have been reversed or changed. Newer information enhances AACE's guidance for the use of hormone therapy in different subsets of women. Newer information helps to support the use of various types of estrogens, selective estrogen-receptor modulators (SERMs), and progesterone, as well as the route of delivery. Newer information supports the previous recommendation against the use of bioidentical hormones. The use of nonhormonal therapies for the symptomatic relief of menopausal symptoms is supported. Newer information enhances AACE's guidance for the use of hormone therapy in different subsets of women. Newer information helps to support the use of various types of estrogens, SERMs, and progesterone, as well as the route of delivery. Newer information supports the previous recommendation against the use of bioidentical hormones. The use of nonhormonal therapies for the symptomatic relief of menopausal symptoms is supported. New recommendations in this position statement include: 1.

Recommendation

the use of menopausal hormone therapy in symptomatic postmenopausal women should be based on consideration of all risk factors for cardiovascular disease, age, and time from menopause. 2.

Recommendation

the use of transdermal as compared with oral estrogen preparations may be considered less likely to produce thrombotic risk and perhaps the risk of stroke and coronary artery disease. 3.

Recommendation

when the use of progesterone is necessary, micronized progesterone is considered the safer alternative. 4.

Recommendation

in symptomatic menopausal women who are at significant risk from the use of hormone replacement therapy, the use of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and possibly other nonhormonal agents may offer significant symptom relief. 5.

Recommendation

AACE does not recommend use of bioidentical hormone therapy. 6.

Recommendation

AACE fully supports the recommendations of the Comité de l'Évolution des Pratiques en Oncologie regarding the management of menopause in women with breast cancer. 7.

Recommendation

HRT is not recommended for the prevention of diabetes. 8.

Recommendation

In women with previously diagnosed diabetes, the use of HRT should be individualized, taking in to account age, metabolic, and cardiovascular risk factors.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113fU5gr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this document is to generate a practice guideline for the management and treatment of symptoms of the menopause.

Participants

The Treatment of Symptoms of the Menopause Task Force included six experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer, all appointed by The Endocrine Society.

Evidence

The Task Force developed this evidenced-based guideline using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The Task Force commissioned three systematic reviews of published data and considered several other existing meta-analyses and trials.

Consensus Process

Multiple e-mail communications, conference calls, and one face-to-face meeting determined consensus. Committees of The Endocrine Society, representatives from endorsing societies, and members of The Endocrine Society reviewed and commented on the drafts of the guidelines. The Australasian Menopause Society, the British Menopause Society, European Menopause and Andropause Society, the European Society of Endocrinology, and the International Menopause Society (co-sponsors of the guideline) reviewed and commented on the draft.

Conclusions

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms and other symptoms of the climacteric. Benefits may exceed risks for the majority of symptomatic postmenopausal women who are under age 60 or under 10 years since the onset of menopause. Health care professionals should individualize therapy based on clinical factors and patient preference. They should screen women before initiating MHT for cardiovascular and breast cancer risk and recommend the most appropriate therapy depending on risk/benefit considerations. Current evidence does not justify the use of MHT to prevent coronary heart disease, breast cancer, or dementia. Other options are available for those with vasomotor symptoms who prefer not to use MHT or who have contraindications because these patients should not use MHT. Low-dose vaginal estrogen and ospemifene provide effective therapy for the genitourinary syndrome of menopause, and vaginal moisturizers and lubricants are available for those not choosing hormonal therapy. All postmenopausal women should embrace appropriate lifestyle measures.

### Hormone therapy in menopause: concepts, controversies, and approach to treatment [^111VeXUA]. Endocrine Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Hormone therapy (HT) is an effective treatment for menopausal symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms and genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Randomized trials also demonstrate positive effects on bone health, and age-stratified analyses indicate more favorable effects on coronary heart disease and all-cause mortality in younger women (close proximity to menopause) than in women more than a decade past menopause. In the absence of contraindications or other major comorbidities, recently menopausal women with moderate or severe symptoms are appropriate candidates for HT. The Women's Health Initiative (WHI) hormone therapy trials-estrogen and progestin trial and the estrogen-alone trial-clarified the benefits and risks of HT, including how the results differed by age. A key lesson from the WHI trials, which was unfortunately lost in the posttrial cacophony, was that the risk:benefit ratio and safety profile of HT differed markedly by clinical characteristics of the participants, especially age, time since menopause, and comorbidity status. In the present review of the WHI and other recent HT trials, we aim to provide readers with an improved understanding of the importance of the timing of HT initiation, type and route of administration, and of patient-specific considerations that should be weighed when prescribing HT.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115TEqN9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — treatment of menopausal symptoms states that menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms and other symptoms of the climacteric, and that benefits clearly exceed risks for the majority of symptomatic postmenopausal women who are under age 60 or under 10 years since the onset of menopause. Health care professionals should individualize therapy based on clinical factors and patient preference, and they should screen women before initiating MHT for cardiovascular and breast cancer risk and recommend the most appropriate therapy depending on risk/benefit considerations. Current evidence does not justify the use of MHT to prevent coronary heart disease, breast cancer, or dementia. For those with vasomotor symptoms who prefer not to use MHT or who have contraindications — because these patients should not use MHT — other options are available; for the genitourinary syndrome of menopause, low-dose vaginal estrogen and ospemifene provide effective therapy, and vaginal moisturizers and lubricants are available for those not choosing hormonal therapy. All postmenopausal women should embrace appropriate lifestyle measures.

### Managing menopause [^117PtbWi]. Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Canada (2014). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for menopause, more specifically with respect to management of vasomotor symptoms, hormonal therapy, SOGC 2014 guidelines recommend to consider offering progestins alone or low-dose oral contraceptives as alternatives for menopausal symptoms during the menopausal transition.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^114vNTEq]. Menopause (2022). High credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy — discontinuation: Controversy exists regarding how long hormone therapy may safely be used and when it should be discontinued. Based on WHI findings, breast cancer risk becomes detectable after 3 to 5 years in women using estrogen-progestin therapy (EPT), whereas for women without a uterus using estrogen therapy (ET) alone, breast cancer risk did not increase after 7 years, so a longer duration of hormone therapy use may be acceptable. There are few studies to guide the optimal way to stop, and vasomotor symptoms (VMS) will recur in approximately 50% of women after discontinuation; data directly comparing abrupt versus tapered discontinuation are lacking, although clinical experts generally advise gradually decreasing hormone therapy doses over time. If hormone therapy is being used for prevention of osteoporosis, protection against bone density loss and fracture prevention is lost rapidly with discontinuation. Although VMS generally improve with time, genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) worsens with prolonged estrogen deficiency, observational studies confirm the long-term safety of low-dose vaginal ET as a highly effective treatment for GSM, and, in the absence of contraindications, a woman should determine her preferred hormone therapy formulation, dose, and duration of use, with ongoing assessment and shared decision-making with her healthcare professional.

### Discontinuation of postmenopausal hormone therapy [^114QXaeo]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Current guidelines recommend that postmenopausal hormone therapy (HT) be used primarily for treatment of vasomotor and urogenital symptoms associated with the menopausal transition and that women use the lowest effective dose for the shortest time necessary. Vasomotor symptoms improve or resolve spontaneously within a few months to a few years of onset in the majority of women, suggesting that most women should be able to discontinue HT within a few years of starting treatment. Approximately 75% of women who try to stop are able to stop HT without major difficulty. However, some women who would like to stop HT are unable to do so, mainly owing to the development of vasomotor symptoms. Troublesome symptoms associated with stopping HT appear to be more common among women who start HT for treatment of symptoms, but they also are reported by women who started HT for other reasons, such as prevention of osteoporosis. Unfortunately, little information is available to guide physicians in helping women who have difficulty stopping HT. Many clinicians recommend slowly tapering HT or adding another drug for treatment of hot flashes, but the effectiveness of these approaches has not been evaluated. For women who cannot tolerate even a slow taper, the value of symptom relief likely outweighs any increased risks due to HT use.

### USPSTF: No HRT after menopause for chronic conditions… [^114JMJKB]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Nov. 10, 2022, 4: 14 p. m. News Staff — The U. S. Preventive Services Task Force is advising family physicians and other health care professionals to avoid administering hormone replacement therapy to patients for the primary prevention of chronic conditions after menopause. The task force's final recommendation statement, issued Nov. 1 and accompanied by a final evidence review and evidence summary, recommended against the use of combined estrogen and progestin to prevent chronic conditions in postmenopausal people and against the use of estrogen alone to prevent chronic conditions in postmenopausal people who have had a hysterectomy. Both recommendations received "D" grades, meaning that the task force concluded with moderate certainty that these treatments had no net benefit. Overall, the recommendation statement is consistent with the task force's 2017 recommendation on the topic.

"For people who have already gone through menopause, using hormone therapy is not an effective way to prevent chronic conditions because the potential harms cancel out any potential benefit, " said Carol Mangione, M. D. M. S. P. H., the task force's chair, in a USPSTF Bulletin. "Fortunately, the task force has many other evidence-based recommendations on ways people can stay healthy as they age". The recommendation statement does not apply to people who are considering HRT to manage perimenopausal symptoms such as vaginal dryness or hot flashes. It also does not apply to people who have had primary ovarian insufficiency or surgical menopause. Story Highlights "Importantly, this recommendation is.

The task force, after reviewing the available evidence, found that while taking HRT to prevent chronic conditions may result in some modest benefits such as reduced risk of fractures and diabetes, it may also lead to increased risk of severe harms such as stroke or thromboembolic events such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, especially among women older than 60. For individuals who should not receive HRT, the USPSTF pointed to a number of recommendations it has issued related to preventing cardiovascular disease and other chronic conditions in adults. These include the use of aspirin to prevent CVD, screening for hypertension, screening for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, behavioral counseling to promote a healthy lifestyle to prevent CVD in adults, and screening for osteoporosis to prevent fractures.

The task force also recommended that patients and health care professionals work together to determine the best way to maintain good health throughout one's lifespan.

### Is timing everything? A meeting report of the society for women's health research roundtable on menopausal hormone therapy [^111QyGbk]. Journal of Women's Health (2013). Low credibility.

The Society for Women's Health Research (SWHR) is a national, nonprofit organization based in Washington DC that is dedicated to transforming women's health through science, advocacy, and education. For more than 10 years, women and the physicians who treat them have been concerned about the safety of menopausal hormone therapy, largely since the early termination of two large federally funded studies. Considerable confusion remains despite decades of accumulated evidence from observational studies, clinical trials, and meta-analyses. In November 2012, SWHR convened 18 of the foremost experts within the field for a roundtable event to discuss the collective evidence related to the risks and benefits of hormone therapy.

### The 2022 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^111ioqqJ]. Menopause (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

"The 2022 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society" (NAMS) updates "The 2017 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society" and identifies future research needs. An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health and menopause was recruited by NAMS to review the 2017 Position Statement, evaluate new literature, assess the evidence, and reach consensus on recommendations, using the level of evidence to identify the strength of recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The Advisory Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. Hormone therapy remains the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and the genitourinary syndrome of menopause and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture. The risks of hormone therapy differ depending on type, dose, duration of use, route of administration, timing of initiation, and whether a progestogen is used. Treatment should be individualized using the best available evidence to maximize benefits and minimize risks, with periodic reevaluation of the benefits and risks of continuing therapy. For women aged younger than 60 years or who are within 10 years of menopause onset and have no contraindications, the benefit-risk ratio is favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS and prevention of bone loss. For women who initiate hormone therapy more than 10 years from menopause onset or who are aged older than 60 years, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable because of the greater absolute risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and dementia. Longer durations of therapy should be for documented indications such as persistent VMS, with shared decision-making and periodic reevaluation. For bothersome genitourinary syndrome of menopause symptoms not relieved with over-the-counter therapies in women without indications for use of systemic hormone therapy, low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy or other therapies (eg, vaginal dehydroepiandrosterone or oral ospemifene) are recommended.

### Cardiovascular risk in menopausal women and our evolving understanding of menopausal hormone therapy: risks, benefits, and current guidelines for use [^116DhHJr]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Women are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared with men. While traditional risk factors for CVD seem to disproportionately affect women and contribute to this disparity, increased prevalence of CVD at midlife calls into question the contribution of menopause. Given the potential role that declining hormone levels play in this transition, menopause hormone therapies (MHT) have been proposed as a strategy for risk factor reduction. Unfortunately, trials have not consistently shown cardiovascular benefit with use, and several describe significant risks. Notably, the timing of hormone administration seems to play a role in its relative risks and benefits. At present, MHT is not recommended for primary or secondary prevention of CVD. For women who may benefit from the associated vasomotor, genitourinary, and/or bone health properties of MHT, CVD risks should be taken into account prior to administration. Further research is needed to assess routes, dosing, and formulations of MHT in order to elucidate appropriate timing for administration. Here, we aim to review both traditional and sex-specific risk factors contributing to increased CVD risk in women with a focus on menopause, understand cardiovascular effects of MHT through a review of several landmark clinical trials, summarize guidelines for appropriate MHT use, and discuss a comprehensive strategy for reducing CV risk in women.

### Evidence-based guideline: premature ovarian insufficiency [^113Df5XT]. Fertility and Sterility (2025). High credibility.

Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) — hormone therapy (HT) principles and indications specify that HT is recommended for women with POI until the usual age of menopause for primary prevention to reduce the risk of morbidity and mortality, whether there are estrogen deficiency symptoms or not; women with POI should be advised that HT is recommended for the treatment of symptoms due to low estrogen concentrations; the guideline group recommends that when women with POI reach the age at which usual menopause occurs, HCPs consider the need for continued HT based on a personalised risk-benefit assessment and current evidence; the guideline group recommends that HCPs advise women with POI that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) does not provide contraception, in order to assist them with their family planning; and in women with POI with evidence of intermittent ovarian function and desiring natural pregnancy, recommendations for HRT remain unchanged, and do not impact chances of natural conception, with a sequential HRT regimen recommended.

### Update on menopause hormone therapy; current indications and unanswered questions [^114pVtrs]. Clinical Endocrinology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide clinicians involved in managing menopause with a summary of current evidence surrounding menopause hormone therapy (MHT).

Design

The authors evaluate and synthesize existing pooled evidence relating to MHT's clinical indications, efficacy, and safety and explore the limitations of existing data.

Patients

The review focuses on MHT-related outcomes in women with natural-timed menopause captured within observational studies, RCTs, and pooled data from pivotal meta-analyses and reviews.

Measurements

Available published data are scrutinized. Available evidence and notably lacking data from women not adequately represented in published MHT trials, such as those with socioeconomic adversity, significant comorbidities, and minority ethnic backgrounds, are highlighted and deliberated.

Results

The impact of MHT differs significantly between demographics. Current consensus recommendations for MHT emphasize the importance of tailoring type, route, dose, and duration of therapy to individual needs and risk/benefit ratio through shared decision-making. MHT impact can change over time. Current MHT data support its benefits for treating menopause symptoms and a potential window of opportunity in midlife to benefit skeletal health. Limitations of current evidence highlight menopause health inequalities and underscores the need for further research.

Conclusions

This review recommends tailored use of MHT for well-defined indications, recognizing its value for menopause symptom relief and skeletal benefits for many midlife women. MHT may be used as long as benefits outweigh risks, through shared decision-making. There is insufficient clinical evidence to support the long-term use of MHT in some contemporary cohorts of women accessing MHT in clinical practice.

### Estrogen and progestogen use in postmenopausal women: 2010 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^116zFqH3]. Menopause (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To update for both clinicians and the lay public the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in July 2008 regarding its recommendations for menopausal hormone therapy (HT) for postmenopausal women, with consideration for the therapeutic benefit-risk ratio at various times through menopause and beyond.

Methods

An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health was enlisted to review the July 2008 NAMS position statement, evaluate new evidence through an evidence-based analysis, and reach consensus on recommendations. The Panel' s recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees as an official NAMS position statement. Also participating in the review process were other interested organizations who then endorsed the document.

Results

Current evidence supports a consensus regarding the role of HT in postmenopausal women, when potential therapeutic benefits and risks around the time of menopause are considered. This paper lists all these areas along with explanatory comments. Areas that vary from the 2008 position statement are noted. A suggested reading list of key references published since the last statement is also provided.

Conclusions

Recent data support the initiation of HT around the time of menopause to treat menopause-related symptoms; to treat or reduce the risk of certain disorders, such as osteoporosis or fractures in select postmenopausal women; or both. The benefit-risk ratio for menopausal HT is favorable for women who initiate HT close to menopause but decreases in older women and with time since menopause in previously untreated women.

### A decade after the women's health initiative – the experts do agree [^111sdCaC]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Hormone therapy duration — dose and time — emphasizes that the lowest dose of hormone therapy should be used for the shortest amount of time to manage menopausal symptoms; although fewer than 5 years is recommended for estrogen with progestogen therapy, duration should be individualized; for estrogen therapy alone, more flexibility in duration of therapy may be possible, but there are reports of increased risk of breast cancer after 10 to 15 years of use in large observational studies with estrogen alone.

### USPSTF recommendation statement: hormone therapy after menopause… [^1126w15K]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Importance Menopause occurs at a median age of 51. 3 years, and the average US woman who reaches menopause is expected to live another 30 years. The prevalence and incidence of most chronic conditions, such as coronary heart disease, dementia, stroke, fractures, and breast cancer, increase with age; however, the excess risk for these conditions that can be attributed to menopause alone is uncertain. Since the publication of findings from the Women's Health Initiative that hormone therapy use is associated with serious adverse health effects in postmenopausal women, use of menopausal hormone therapy has declined. Conclusions and Recommendation The USPSTF recommends against the use of combined estrogen and progestin for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women. The USPSTF recommends against the use of estrogen alone for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women who have had a hysterectomy.

The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that the use of estrogen alone has no net benefit for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in most postmenopausal women who have had a hysterectomy. This recommendation statement applies to asymptomatic, postmenopausal women who are considering hormone therapy for the primary prevention of chronic medical conditions. It does not apply to women who are considering hormone therapy for the management of menopausal symptoms, such as hot flashes or vaginal dryness. It also does not apply to women who have had premature menopause or surgical menopause. Indications for hormone therapy approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in menopausal women are limited to the treatment of menopausal symptoms and the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

An FDA-issued black box warning indicates that estrogen therapy, with or without progestin, should be prescribed at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with the patient's treatment goals and risks.
2. Evidence is limited whether the benefits and harms of menopausal hormone therapy vary by age, race/ethnicity, or timing of initiation after menopause. In the WHI trial, the test for trend by age group showed a statistically significant trend toward lower all-cause mortality among younger women assigned to estrogen alone but not women assigned to combined estrogen and progestin. Both studies were subsets of the WHI trial and were limited to women aged 65 to 79 years at baseline who were free of probable dementia.

### Use of hormone replacement therapy and risk of breast cancer: nested case-control studies using the QResearch and CPRD databases [^112tMeML]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) (also known as hormone therapy (HT) or menopausal hormonal therapy (MHT)) is prescribed to relieve the symptoms of menopause, which can be life changing. HRT is used by millions of women, sometimes over extended periods. A range of hormone combinations are available, each with different efficacy and side effects. HRT can bring several improvements to quality of life, and it can prevent osteoporosis. Concerns about adverse effects, particularly the increased risk of breast cancer associated with HRT, has, however, resulted in a substantial decrease in HRT use over the past 17 years. Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, with more than 55 000 women in the UK affected each year, so different drug use scenarios might result in substantial differences in the number of women who develop breast cancer, even though the risk differences between hormones might seem relatively small. Current clinical guidelines recommend use of HRT for no longer than five years and have signalled that more information is needed about the risks of breast cancer associated with different types of HRT.

### Menopausal hormone therapy: current considerations [^114KkBWo]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the most effective treatment for vasomotor and vaginal symptoms. Today, symptomatic women younger than 60 years of age or less than 10 years since onset of menopause yield the greatest benefit of MHT with the lowest risks when compared with older women remote from menopause. Careful assessment before initiating therapy includes severity of bothersome symptoms, treatment preferences, medical history, presence of contraindications to MHT, and personal risk of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer. Considerations of type of MHT, dosing, and route of administration, and recommendations regarding duration of therapy are discussed.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114TFAjK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) monitoring and discontinuation — For women with persistent unscheduled bleeding while taking MHT, we recommend evaluation to rule out pelvic pathology, most importantly, endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, and we recommend informing women about the possible increased risk of breast cancer during and after discontinuing EPT and emphasizing the importance of adhering to age-appropriate breast cancer screening. We suggest that the decision to continue MHT be revisited at least annually, targeting the shortest total duration of MHT consistent with the treatment goals and evolving risk assessment of the individual woman. For young women with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), premature or early menopause, without contraindications, we suggest taking MHT until the time of anticipated natural menopause, when the advisability of continuing MHT can be reassessed. For women preparing to discontinue MHT, we suggest a shared decision-making approach to elicit individual preference about adopting a gradual taper vs abrupt discontinuation.

### Patient information: treatment of menopause symptoms with hormone therapy… [^112EForY]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

For most individuals, natural menopause occurs between age 45 and 55 years, with an average age of around 51 years. Terms such as menopausal transition and perimenopause are also used to describe the transition from premenopause to menopause. Menstrual periods naturally stop during menopause due to the decrease in estrogen. In individuals who have surgery or procedures of the uterus prior to menopause, periods may stop before menopause. Estrogen, and sometimes progesterone, are the 2 hormones used to reduce many of the symptoms of menopause. It is important to add progesterone to estrogen to reduce risk of uterine cancer. However, when the uterus has been removed, estrogen alone is recommended. Hormone therapy can be either systemic or delivered via low-dose vaginal preparations. Systemic estrogen is typically taken either orally as a pill or absorbed through the skin via a patch or gel.

Low-dose vaginal estrogen can be delivered via inserts or creams, which are not highly absorbed into the bloodstream. Progesterone is typically taken as a pill, either separately or as a combination pill with estrogen. For most clinicians and patients, the discussion of hormone therapy is focused on systemic estrogen. Studies have shown that systemic menopausal hormone therapy is effective for treating vasomotor symptoms. These treatments are also effective for treating genitourinary syndrome of menopause. However, for vaginal or urinary symptoms without vasomotor symptoms, low-dose vaginal estrogen is recommended. While risks of systemic menopausal hormone therapy are low in individuals younger than 60 years, both estrogen and combination hormone therapy are associated with a slight increased risk of breast cancer and blood clots.

Systemic hormone therapy may also be linked to an increased risk of heart disease, but the evidence about this is less conclusive. In general, individuals who have menopause-related hot flashes and/or night sweats that are negatively affecting their sleep and quality of life and who are not at high risk of blood clots, breast or endometrial cancer, or heart disease may be good candidates for systemic hormone therapy. Because menopause symptoms are usually more severe during early menopause, and the risk of adverse effects of hormone therapy increases with age, many clinicians choose to prescribe systemic hormone therapy only in patients younger than 60 years who are within 10 years of menopause onset. However, for all patients, decisions about treatment of menopausal symptoms should be made on an individual basis.

### Menopause hormone therapy: 30 years of advances and controversies [^114ix3BR]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Menopause Hormone Therapy (MHT) recommendations have changed significantly over the last thirty years. Early observational studies suggested that MHT offered broad benefits for women, including relief from menopausal symptoms, improved genitourinary health, prevention of osteoporosis, and reduction in cardiovascular disease. As randomized controlled trials were conducted to validate these findings, new evidence emerged that led to shifts in guidance from medical societies and sharp declines in MHT prescriptions. This review summarizes three decades of studies, key advancements and ongoing controversies. We also discuss recommendations for MHT from cardiology, obstetrics/ gynecology and endocrinology perspectives.

### Hormone-replacement therapy: current thinking [^111ZZbUb]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2017). Medium credibility.

For several decades, the role of hormone-replacement therapy (HRT) has been debated. Early observational data on HRT showed many benefits, including a reduction in coronary heart disease (CHD) and mortality. More recently, randomized trials, including the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), studying mostly women many years after the the onset of menopause, showed no such benefit and, indeed, an increased risk of CHD and breast cancer, which led to an abrupt decrease in the use of HRT. Subsequent reanalyzes of data from the WHI with age stratification, newer randomized and observational data and several meta-analyses now consistently show reductions in CHD and mortality when HRT is initiated soon after menopause. HRT also significantly decreases the incidence of various symptoms of menopause and the risk of osteoporotic fractures, and improves quality of life. In younger healthy women (aged 50–60 years), the risk-benefit balance is positive for using HRT, with risks considered rare. As no validated primary prevention strategies are available for younger women (< 60 years of age), other than lifestyle management, some consideration might be given to HRT as a prevention strategy as treatment can reduce CHD and all-cause mortality. Although HRT should be primarily oestrogen-based, no particular HRT regimen can be advocated.

### Rethinking menopausal hormone therapy: for whom, what, when, and how long? [^116rfD6e]. Circulation (2023). Medium credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (HT) was widely used in the past, but with the publication of seminal primary and secondary prevention trials that reported an excess cardiovascular risk with combined estrogen-progestin, HT use declined significantly. However, over the past 20 years, much has been learned about the relationship between the timing of HT use with respect to age and time since menopause, HT route of administration, and cardiovascular disease risk. Four leading medical societies recommend HT for the treatment of menopausal women with bothersome menopausal symptoms. In this context, this review, led by the American College of Cardiology Cardiolovascular Disease in Women Committee, along with leading gynecologists, women's health internists, and endocrinologists, aims to provide guidance on HT use, including the selection of patients and HT formulation with a focus on caring for symptomatic women with cardiovascular disease risk.

### Current recommendations: what is the clinician to do? [^111Jkgg2]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (HT) has complex biologic effects but continues to have an important clinical role in the management of vasomotor and other menopausal symptoms. The rational use of menopausal HT requires balancing the potential benefits and risks of treatment. Findings from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) and other randomized clinical trials have helped to clarify the benefits and risks of HT and have provided insights to improve decision making. Several clinical characteristics have utility in identifying women for whom benefits of HT are likely to outweigh the risks. Age and time since menopause are strong predictors of health outcomes and absolute risks associated with HT, and differences by age have been particularly apparent for estrogen alone. In the WHI trial of conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) alone, younger women (50–59 years) had more favorable results for all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and the global index, but not for stroke and venous thrombosis. Age trends were less clear for CEE + medroxyprogesterone acetate, owing to increased risks of breast cancer, stroke, and venous thrombosis in all age groups. Absolute risks of adverse events were lower in younger than in older women in both trials, however. Other predictors of lower vascular risk from HT include favorable lipid status and absence of the metabolic syndrome. Transdermal administration may be associated with lower risks of venous thrombosis and stroke, but additional research is needed. The use of risk stratification and personalized risk assessment offers promise for improved benefit-risk profile and safety of HT. One approach to decision making is presented. Key elements include: assessment of whether the patient has moderate to severe menopausal symptoms, the primary indication for initiating systemic HT (vaginal estrogen may be used to treat genitourinary symptoms in the absence of vasomotor symptoms); understanding the patient's own preference regarding therapy; evaluating the patient for the presence of any contraindications to HT, as well as the time since menopause onset and baseline risks of cardiovascular disease and breast cancer; reviewing carefully the benefits and risks of treatment with the patient, giving more emphasis to absolute than to relative measures of effect; and, if HT is initiated, regularly reviewing the patient's need for continued treatment.

### Postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy for primary prevention of chronic conditions: recommendations and rationale [^113MGd5S]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

This statement summarizes the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendations for use of hormone replacement therapy for the primary prevention of chronic conditions in postmenopausal women and updates the 1996 USPSTF recommendations on this topic. The complete information on which this statement is based, including evidence tables and references, is available through the USPSTF Web site (http://www.preventiveservices.ahrq.gov) and through the National Guideline Clearinghouse (http://www.guideline.gov) The USPSTF reviewed the evidence on the use of postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy and the following outcomes: cardiovascular disease, including CHD and stroke; osteoporosis and fractures; thromboembolism; dementia and cognitive function; breast, colon, ovarian, and endometrial cancer; and cholecystitis. The USPSTF also reviewed evidence of the effects of hormone replacement therapy on phytoestrogens and osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. The use of hormone replacement therapy for relieving active symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes, urogenital symptoms, and mood and sleep disturbances, among others, is outside the scope of these USPSTF recommendations, and literature on this topic was not reviewed.

The 2017 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) updates the 2012 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society and identifies future research needs. An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health and menopause was recruited by NAMS to review the 2012 Position Statement, evaluate new literature, assess the evidence, and reach consensus on recommendations, using the level of evidence to identify the strength of recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. Hormone therapy (HT) remains the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture. The risks of HT differ depending on type, dose, duration of use, route of administration, timing of initiation, and whether a progestogen is used. Treatment should be individualized to identify the most appropriate HT type, dose, formulation, route of administration, and duration of use, using the best available evidence to maximize benefits and minimize risks, with periodic reevaluation of the benefits and risks of continuing or discontinuing HT. For women aged younger than 60 years or who are within 10 years of menopause onset and have no contraindications, the benefit-risk ratio is most favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS and for those at elevated risk for bone loss or fracture. For women who initiate HT more than 10 or 20 years from menopause onset or are aged 60 years or older, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable because of the greater absolute risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and dementia. Longer durations of therapy should be for documented indications such as persistent VMS or bone loss, with shared decision making and periodic reevaluation. For bothersome GSM symptoms not relieved with over-the-counter therapies and without indications for use of systemic HT, low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy or other therapies are recommended. This NAMS position statement has been endorsed by Academy of Women's Health, American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American Association of Nurse Practitioners, American Medical Women's Association, American Society for Reproductive Medicine, Asociación Mexicana para el Estudio del Climaterio, Association of Reproductive Health Professionals, Australasian Menopause Society, Chinese Menopause Society, Colegio Mexicano de Especialistas en Ginecologia y Obstetricia, Czech Menopause and Andropause Society, Dominican Menopause Society, European Menopause and Andropause Society, German Menopause Society, Groupe d'études de la ménopause et du vieillissement Hormonal, HealthyWomen, Indian Menopause Society, International Menopause Society, International Osteoporosis Foundation, International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health, Israeli Menopause Society, Japan Society of Menopause and Women's Health, Korean Society of Menopause, Menopause Research Society of Singapore, National Association of Nurse Practitioners in Women's Health, SOBRAC and FEBRASGO, SIGMA Canadian Menopause Society, Società Italiana della Menopausa, Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, South African Menopause Society, Taiwanese Menopause Society, and the Thai Menopause Society.

### Menopausal hormone therapy for breast cancer patients: what is the current evidence? [^114gS8rC]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

Importance and Objectives

Many breast cancer survivors struggle with menopausal symptoms due to oncological treatment-induced hormone deficiency, or because they experience menopause some years after completing treatment, but have limited menopause treatment options. Estrogen replacement therapy is the most effective treatment for menopausal symptoms, but is not recommended after breast cancer because it can﻿ increase the risk of relapse. Our objectives were to review the evidence and develop a consensus statement to define the role of menopausal hormone therapy after breast cancer, and to highlight evidence gaps to inform future research.

Methods

A 25-member multidisciplinary panel developed the consensus statements using a modified Delphi methodology. The panel consisted of 18 senior doctors who voted (5 GP menopause specialists, 5 gynecologists, 4 medical oncologists, 3 breast surgical oncologists, and 1 breast radiologist), and 7 members﻿ who did not vote ﻿(4 patient representatives, 1 medical oncologist, 1 urologist and 1 administrator). Consensus was defined as ≥ 70% agreement with low-to-moderate variation in extent of agreement (mean absolute deviation from median of ≤ 0.75). We reviewed current evidence relating to use of vaginal and systemic menopausal hormone therapy ("MHT",﻿ also known as "hormone therapy", "HT" or "hormone replacement therapy", "HRT") after breast cancer diagnosis, and adjuvant endocrine (anti-estrogen) therapy, and developed a narrative synthesis. Finally, four additional breast cancer specialists peer-reviewed the manuscript.

Discussion and Conclusions

The panel agreed that some women may choose to take MHT, (off-label use) and accept an increased risk of relapse in exchange for relief from menopausal symptoms and an improved quality of life, and that preferences may vary according to individual circumstances and the absolute risk of relapse. All respondents agreed or strongly agreed with statements supporting shared decision making and individualized menopause care (MADM 0.29). In our review of the literature, we found mainly moderate quality evidence concerning use of vaginal and systemic estrogen after breast cancer, and high quality evidence concerning the benefits of anti-estrogen therapy for estrogen receptor positive breast cancer. Based on the available data, we recommend that shared decisions are based on (1) an individual's menopausal symptoms and impact on quality of life, (2) the potential increase in an individual's risk of relapse by use of menopausal hormone therapy, and (3) patient preferences, views and treatment goals. Clinicians and patients can use our findings to make informed menopause treatment choices after breast cancer. We strongly recommend registering all patients considering MHT after breast cancer in a clinical study (eg, MENopausal hormone therapy and Outcomes After Breast Cancer, the MENO-ABC trial).

### The 2012 hormone therapy position statement of: the North American Menopause Society [^114YryjJ]. Menopause (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

This position statement aimed to update the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in 2010 regarding recommendations for hormone therapy (HT) for postmenopausal women. This updated position statement further distinguishes the emerging differences in the therapeutic benefit-risk ratio between estrogen therapy (ET) and combined estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT) at various ages and time intervals since menopause onset.

Methods

An Advisory Panel of expert clinicians and researchers in the field of women's health was enlisted to review the 2010 NAMS position statement, evaluate new evidence, and reach consensus on recommendations. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees as an official NAMS position statement.

Results

Current evidence supports the use of HT for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women when the balance of potential benefits and risks is favorable for the individual woman. This position statement reviews the effects of ET and EPT on many aspects of women's health and recognizes the greater safety profile associated with ET.

Conclusions

Recent data support the initiation of HT around the time of menopause to treat menopause-related symptoms and to prevent osteoporosis in women at high risk of fracture. The more favorable benefit-risk ratio for ET allows more flexibility in extending the duration of use compared with EPT, where the earlier appearance of increased breast cancer risk precludes a recommendation for use beyond 3 to 5 years.

### Oestrogen replacement in postmenopausal women [^1116A9rU]. Age and Ageing (2015). Low credibility.

Menopausal symptoms can disrupt a woman's personal and social life. Vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes and night sweats) are the most common symptoms and can be treated very effectively with oestrogen-based hormone therapy. The decision to use oestrogen (often simply termed hormone therapy or hormone replacement therapy or HT) therapy involves balancing the potential benefits against the potential risks. Most agree that short-term oestrogen therapy, using the lowest effective dose, is a reasonable option for recently menopausal women with moderate-to-severe symptoms who are in good cardiovascular health (Martin and Manson. 2008. J. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 93, 4567–75). Whilst effective and safe in most instances, HT is not suitable for all women or for all menopause-related symptoms when alternatives are available. The role of HRT in chronic disease prevention is also discussed.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114UWJ1K]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Duration of menopausal hormone therapy — We suggest that the decision to continue MHT be revisited at least annually, targeting the shortest total duration of MHT consistent with the treatment goals and evolving risk assessment of the individual woman. Technical remarks note that current proposed limits on duration are informed by large intervention trials (5 to 7 y) with extended follow-up for 13 years, that risk rates for breast cancer and CVD increase with age and time since menopause with risks appearing less with ET than with EPT, and that ovarian cancer risk may also increase relative to duration of MHT. The guideline concludes that clinicians and patients should reassess MHT continuation yearly and discuss the risks and individual benefits beyond 5 years.

### ACOG committee opinion. risk of breast cancer with estrogen-progestin replacement therapy [^114km4ep]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2002). Low credibility.

Recent articles have examined the association between the use of combination estrogen-progestin regimens for hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and the risk of breast cancer. The objective of this Committee Opinion is to evaluate critically the presented evidence. Although epidemiologic studies suggest that the addition of progestins to estrogens may increase the risk of breast cancer, this increased risk has not been proved. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists continues to recommend that HRT be considered as a treatment to relieve vasomotor symptoms and genitourinary tract atrophy and to reduce the risk of osteoporosis and, potentially, cardiovascular disease. Postmenopausal women should be apprised of the current understanding of the risks and benefits of HRT. When considering the use of HRT for longer than 5 years, the clinician and individual patient should weigh the benefits versus the potential side effects and risks for that particular patient.

### Is it time to revisit the recommendations for initiation of menopausal hormone therapy? [^113Vxb4F]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2025). High credibility.

Findings from the Women's Health Initiative studies led to menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) guidelines generally recommending the initiation of MHT be limited to women within 10 years of their menopause or before the age of 60 years. This recommendation has led to women who experience troublesome menopausal symptoms and who have not commenced MHT within these limits often being denied this type of therapy. Similarly, the majority of women who might benefit from the protective effects of MHT against bone loss and fracture are not offered this treatment option if they do not fit with these criteria. Based on review of the evidence that led to the conditional initiation of MHT, and subsequent studies, we propose that the recommendations regarding the initiation of MHT need to change to be more inclusive of women outside these chronological limits.

### Assessing benefits and harms of hormone replacement therapy: clinical applications [^113U5vbf]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

An estimated one third of postmenopausal women in the United States use hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to treat symptoms of menopause and prevent chronic conditions. In the context of this widespread use, evidence has been growing about the potential harms of HRT, particularly regarding long-term use. Physicians and patients are often confused about how to use results of studies in individual cases. This article applies the current state of evidence for the benefits and harms of HRT to management decisions in 4 clinical situations. Patient preferences, as well as evidence, are important for these decisions. Benefits and harms need to be readdressed periodically to apply newly published evidence and to reassess emerging risks, comorbidities, and needs of individuals.

Although providing guidance to patients regarding duration of hormone therapy represents a topic surrounded by controversy, clinicians often encounter this issue in practice. As pointed out in the NAMS 2012 Hormone Therapy (HT) Position Statement, determining the optimal duration of HT is challenging both for clinicians and for patients. This Practice Pearl addresses clinical situations for which long-term HT might be appropriate and provides practical guidance regarding prudent therapeutic choices for women using HT for an extended duration.

Clinical management during menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) — For women with persistent unscheduled bleeding while taking MHT, we recommend evaluation to rule out pelvic pathology, most importantly, endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, and we recommend informing women about the possible increased risk of breast cancer during and after discontinuing EPT while emphasizing adherence to age-appropriate breast cancer screening. Regular clinical follow-up, initially, within 1 to 3 months after starting MHT, and then every 6 to 12 months, allows monitoring of efficacy and side effects and treatment adjustments as needed.

### Type and timing of menopausal hormone therapy and breast cancer risk: individual participant meta-analysis of the worldwide epidemiological evidence [^1172uJCe]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

A previous meta-analysis of the worldwide evidence found that current and recent users of menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) were at an increased risk of breast cancer, but little information was available about the effects of different types of MHT, or about long-term risks after MHT use had ceased. Since then, much new information has become available, including results from randomised trials (appendix pp 6–15), generally showing greater risks of breast cancer with preparations containing both oestrogen and progestagen than with preparations containing oestrogen alone, but published information on long-term effects of past use has remained limited.

MHT has been used mostly in western countries, with about 600 million woman-years of use since 1970 (figure 1; appendix p 16, 27). Use increased rapidly during the 1990s, halved abruptly in the early 2000s, and stabilised during the 2010s with about 12 million current users. Women tend to begin MHT at around the time of the menopause and can continue for several years. At these ages, breast cancer is the most common malignancy in western countries; almost 3% of women are diagnosed with it during their 50s (appendix p 17). While regulatory bodies in Europe and the USA recommend that MHT be used for the shortest time that it is needed, some clinical guidelines recommended less restrictive prescribing.

### Cardiovascular risk in menopausal women and our evolving understanding of menopausal hormone therapy: risks, benefits, and current guidelines for use [^111Bw5aY]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Despite recent improvements in sex and gender research in cardiovascular disease (CVD), disparities still exist. Ischemic heart disease (IHD) in particular remains a leading cause of death in women. The reasons for this are multifactorial and include biological, social, environmental, and economic factors. While men and women share many traditional risk factors for CVD, these alone do not explain the sex-specific increased risk of CVD in women. Additional female-specific risk factors, most notably menopause, contribute significantly. Menopause has been associated with an increased CVD risk in women aged ⩾55 years. The transition to menopause has shown to be associated with negative alterations in the lipid profile, increased susceptibility to weight gain and metabolic syndrome, and both epicardial and paracardial fat deposition. – It represents a vulnerable time for women and an opportunity for consideration of menopause hormone therapy (MHT).

In prior decades, MHT was thought to be effective in primary and secondary prevention of CVD. However, large trials demonstrating the risks of MHT have changed clinician and public perception of these strategies. As our understanding of MHT has evolved, so has our knowledge regarding the appropriate timing and patient characteristics for safe administration. Given the efficacy of MHT in reducing the unpleasant vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause, which can severely alter quality of life, understanding the safety and potential cardiovascular (CV) risks and benefits of MHT is important in optimizing the health of our female patients.

### Lipid management in patients with endocrine disorders: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^114FRTbh]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Menopause and hormonal replacement — In postmenopausal women, we recommend treating dyslipidemia with statin therapy, rather than hormone therapy; hormone therapy increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, specifically venous thromboembolism and stroke, however, the absolute risk of cardiovascular disease is lower in younger compared to older postmenopausal women, and hormone therapy is described as estrogen ± progesterone/a progestin; in postmenopausal women on hormone therapy and when risk factors for cardiovascular disease, we recommend statin therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk; menopause may be associated with an increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; risk factors may be traditional risk factors or risk-enhancing factors; in women who enter menopause early (< 40 to 45 years old), we recommend assessment and treatment of lipids and other cardiovascular risk factors; early menopause enhances cardiovascular disease risk and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk should be calculated and followed after menopause.

### Estrogen and progestogen use in peri-and postmenopausal women: March 2007 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^114i3Dza]. Menopause (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in 2004 regarding recommendations for estrogen and progestogen use in peri- and postmenopausal women.

Design

NAMS followed the general principles established for evidence-based guidelines to create this updated document. An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health was enlisted to review the 2004 NAMS position statement, compile supporting statements, and reach consensus on recommendations. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. The position statements published by NAMS do not represent "practice standards" that would be codified and held up as standards by regulating bodies and insurance agencies. Rather, they are prevailing opinion pieces in a best effort attempt to incorporate current evidence into practical clinical recommendations.

Results

With the primary goal being to evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of peri- and postmenopausal estrogen therapy (ET) and estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT) for both disease prevention and treatment of menopause-related symptoms, current evidence allowed for a clear distinction between areas of consensus and areas for which the Panel determined that there was inadequate evidence for any conclusion to be reached. The document lists all of these areas along with clear explanatory comments. A comprehensive list of key references is provided. The absence of evidence is also recognized in the list of needs for further research recommended by the Panel.

Conclusions

Current evidence supports the use of ET or EPT for menopause-related symptoms and disease prevention in appropriate populations of peri- and postmenopausal women.

### A decade after the women's health initiative – the experts do agree [^1146ThMd]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Menopause hormone therapy — overview and symptom relief benefits emphasize that systemic hormone therapy is an acceptable option for relatively young (up to age 59 or within 10 years of menopause) and healthy women who are bothered by moderate to severe menopausal symptoms, and that individualization is key with consideration of quality-of-life priorities and risk factors including age, time since menopause, and risks of blood clots, heart disease, stroke, and breast cancer. Systemic hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for most menopausal symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms and vaginal atrophy; estrogen therapy as a single agent is sufficient in women who have undergone hysterectomy, whereas progestogen therapy is required to prevent endometrial cancer when estrogen is used systemically in women with a uterus. For symptoms limited to vaginal dryness or discomfort with intercourse, local estrogen therapy is effective and preferred, and low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy is recommended in this setting.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112DM7K1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) — evidence on age and timing and use of risk tools: Results showing fewer excess CHD and stroke events when MHT was initiated in younger rather than older study participants in the WHI provide the foundation for the widely accepted consensus that MHT should be initiated primarily in younger women (age < 60 y) close in time (< 10 y) to menopause onset. We feel that methods to integrate these factors to categorize individual risk as minimal, moderate, and high are useful and can be accomplished qualitatively by clinical judgment or quantitatively by risk assessment tools, and country- and population-specific CVD risk calculators are available to quantify individual risk per local guidelines; however, specific cutoffs for the safe use of MHT have not been formally validated, and practice differs from country to country.

North American Menopause Society (NAMS) 2022 position statement — key points on breast cancer risk and counseling for hormone therapy: The risk of breast cancer related to hormone therapy is low, with estimates indicating a rare occurrence (less than one additional case per 1,000 women per year of hormone therapy use or three additional cases per 1,000 women when used for 5 years with CEE plus MPA) (Level I). Women should be counseled about the risk of breast cancer with hormone therapy, putting the data into perspective, with risk similar to that of modifiable risk factors such as two daily alcoholic beverages, obesity, and low physical activity (Level III). Different hormone therapy regimens may be associated with increased breast density, which may obscure mammographic interpretation, leading to more mammograms or more breast biopsies and a potential delay in breast cancer diagnosis (Level II), and the effect of hormone therapy on breast cancer risk may depend on the type of hormone therapy, duration of use, regimen, prior exposure, and individual characteristics (Level II).

Tailoring menopausal hormone therapy — shared decision-making, dosing, and monitoring are specified as follows: "We suggest a shared decision-making approach to decide about the choice of formulation, starting dose, the route of administration of MHT, and how to tailor MHT to each woman's individual situation, risks, and treatment goals". Clinicians prescribe estrogen alone for women without a uterus, use "the lowest effective dose with upward titration based on clinical response", and "usually do not measure estradiol levels to monitor therapy except when symptoms do not improve with escalating doses, particularly after changing the mode of administration from oral to transdermal". For younger women with surgical menopause or those with POI, higher starting doses may be used, for example "transdermal estradiol, 100 μg", then tapered as tolerated, and "the reassessment and tapering of MHT dose seems reasonable" as premature menopause approaches the natural menopause age.

### Is there any rationale for prescribing hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to prevent or to treat osteoarthritis? [^113a71Gt]. Osteoarthritis and Cartilage (2003). Low credibility.

Background

During the last two decades of the 20th century, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has been considered as the sole pharmacological approach for counterbalancing or mitigating the effects of estrogens deprivation in post-menopausal women. Subsequently, HRT has been widely recommended for the management of chronic diseases occurring, in women during the second half of their life. The overall risk/benefit ratio of estrogens has been recently reassessed in the light of long-term prospective studies failing to demonstrate the expected benefit of HRT on cardiovascular diseases incidence. Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the chronic conditions for which HRT has been suggested to provide beneficial outcomes.

Results

The presence of estrogen receptors in human cartilage is no longer debated. However, cellular or animal models of OA do not provide an unequivocal pathway for the influence of gonadal steroids on cartilage. Similarly, studies attempting to correlate serum or urinary levels of sex steroids to the onset or progression of OA gave conflicting results. No randomized, prospective, controlled trial was designed to specifically assess the impact of hormone replacement therapy on symptomatic or structural progression of OA. Large-scale observational studies or trials designed to assess other potential benefits of estrogens suggest that HRT use does not provide symptomatic relief in OA but may interfere with its long-term structural progression, particularly in the lower limbs.

Conclusion

Based on the recent results of the Women Health Initiative suggesting that HRT health risks may outweigh benefits, one can hardly recommend, with the current level of evidence, HRT as a first-line treatment against progression of OA.
