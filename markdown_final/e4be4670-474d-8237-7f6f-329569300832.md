## Question

This question refers to the following information.
Read the following quote.
I had now decided beyond all question that there existed in the heavens three stars wandering about Jupiter as do Venus and Mercury about the sun, and this became plainer than daylight from observations on similar occasions which followed. Nor were there just three such stars; four wanderers complete their revolutions about Jupiter, and of their alterations as observed more precisely later on we shall give a description here. Also I measured the distances between them by means of the telescope..
Such are the observations concerning the four Medicean planets recently first discovered by me, and although from this data their periods have not yet been reconstructed in numerical form, it is legitimate at least to put in evidence some facts worthy of note. Above all, since they sometimes follow and sometimes precede Jupiter by the same intervals, and they remain within very limited distances either to east or west of Jupiter, accompanying that planet in both its retrograde and direct movements in a constant manner, no one can doubt that they complete their revolutions about Jupiter and at the same time effect all together a twelve-year period about the center of the universe.
 — Galileo Galilei, 1610
Which of the following Polish thinkers was most likely the person whose ideas convinced Galileo to have written the statement above?

Answer Choices:
A. Nicolaus Copernicus
B. Johannes Kepler
C. Galileo Galilei
D. Josef Pilsudski

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which Polish thinker's ideas most likely convinced Galileo to write his 1610 observations of Jupiter's moons, and to choose among Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo himself, and Józef Piłsudski. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the historical context of Galileo's discovery and what exactly he was asserting. Then, I should verify which of the candidates were actually Polish and alive at relevant times. Next, I will examine whose intellectual framework most plausibly shaped Galileo's interpretation of moons orbiting a planet. Finally, I will eliminate the implausible options and confirm the best answer with a concise justification.

> Let me first confirm the core claim in Galileo's text. He is reporting the discovery of four "stars" that orbit Jupiter, remain close to the planet, and move with it through the sky, which he interprets as a miniature planetary system and links to a twelve-year period that reflects Jupiter's orbit around the center of the universe; this is the famous account of the Medicean moons published in Sidereus Nuncius in 1610, and it explicitly treats Jupiter as a center of revolution for these bodies [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the nationality and chronology of the candidates. Nicolaus Copernicus was Polish and published the heliocentric model in De revolutionibus orbium coelestium in 1543, which predates Galileo's 1610 observations and provides the conceptual framework that planets, including Earth, can be centers of orbital motion for other bodies. Johannes Kepler was German, not Polish, so he cannot be the correct answer to a question about a Polish thinker. Galileo Galilei was Italian, so he cannot be the Polish thinker either. Józef Piłsudski was a 20th-century Polish political leader, far too late to influence Galileo, so he is irrelevant here [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm whose ideas most directly informed Galileo's interpretation. The key intellectual leap Galileo makes is to see Jupiter's moons as orbiting a planet, mirroring the Copernican insight that Earth and other planets can be centers of orbital motion; this is precisely the heliocentric framework that Copernicus established, even though Copernicus did not know about Jupiter's moons, because it normalizes the idea that celestial bodies orbit centers other than Earth. Kepler, while important, was a contemporary collaborator and correspondent rather than the foundational influence in this specific interpretive move, and again, he was not Polish [^notfound].

> I need to ensure I eliminate the distractors cleanly. Kepler is eliminated because he is German, not Polish. Galileo is eliminated because he is Italian and cannot be the Polish thinker in question. Piłsudski is eliminated by anachronism and irrelevance to 17th-century astronomy. That leaves Copernicus as the only Polish thinker whose ideas plausibly shaped Galileo's readiness to interpret moons orbiting Jupiter as evidence of a non-Earth-centered orbital system [^notfound].

> Let me reconsider the reasoning to avoid overstatement. Galileo's telescopic discovery was his own, but his conceptual framing — that these moons are a planetary system in miniature — reflects the Copernican revolution in cosmology that had already displaced Earth from the unique center of all celestial motion. Thus, while Galileo made the observation, the interpretive lens that made it meaningful as evidence for non-geocentric orbital dynamics traces back to Copernicus's heliocentric model, making Copernicus the Polish thinker whose ideas most convincingly informed Galileo's statement [^notfound].

> Final answer: A. Nicolaus Copernicus.

---

The correct answer is **Nicolaus Copernicus**. Galileo's discovery of Jupiter's moons provided direct evidence that not all celestial bodies orbit Earth, supporting Copernicus's heliocentric model, which posited that Earth and other planets orbit the Sun. This contradicted the geocentric view and aligned with Copernican ideas, even though Copernicus himself did not predict moons orbiting other planets. Johannes Kepler, though influential, was German, not Polish, and Galileo was Italian; Józef Piłsudski was a 20th-century political figure unrelated to this scientific context.

## Historical context of Galileo's observations

In 1610, Galileo Galilei observed four celestial bodies orbiting Jupiter, which he termed the "Medicean planets" (now known as the Galilean moons: Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto). These observations were groundbreaking because they provided the first direct evidence that not all celestial bodies orbited Earth, challenging the long-standing geocentric model of the universe. Galileo's observations were documented in his work "Sidereus Nuncius" (The Starry Messenger), published in 1610 [^notfound].

---

## Influence of Nicolaus Copernicus

Nicolaus Copernicus, a Polish astronomer, proposed the heliocentric model of the universe in his seminal work "De revolutionibus orbium coelestium" (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres), published in 1543. According to Copernicus, the Sun, rather than Earth, was at the center of the universe, and Earth and other planets orbited the Sun. This model fundamentally challenged the geocentric view that had dominated Western thought for centuries.

Galileo's observations of Jupiter's moons provided empirical evidence that supported Copernicus's heliocentric model. By demonstrating that celestial bodies could orbit planets other than Earth, Galileo's findings indirectly validated the idea that Earth itself could orbit the Sun without requiring Earth to be the center of all celestial motion. Although Copernicus did not specifically predict the existence of moons orbiting other planets, his heliocentric framework made such discoveries intellectually plausible and consistent with his broader cosmological theory.

---

## Role of Johannes Kepler

Johannes Kepler, a German astronomer, was a contemporary of Galileo and a strong advocate of the heliocentric model. Kepler's laws of planetary motion, formulated in the early 17th century, provided mathematical support for Copernicus's theory. While Kepler's work was influential in reinforcing the heliocentric model, he was not Polish, and therefore does not fit the criteria of the question.

---

## Elimination of incorrect options

- **Galileo Galilei**: Galileo was Italian, not Polish, and cannot be considered a Polish thinker.
- **Josef Pilsudski**: Józef Piłsudski was a Polish political leader and statesman who lived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He had no connection to astronomical theories or Galileo's observations.

---

## Conclusion

The Polish thinker whose ideas most likely convinced Galileo to interpret his observations of Jupiter's moons as evidence of a heliocentric universe was **Nicolaus Copernicus**. His heliocentric model provided the theoretical framework that made Galileo's discoveries intellectually coherent and supportive of the idea that Earth and other planets orbit the Sun.

### Josef klingler's models of white matter tracts: influences on neuroanatomy, neurosurgery, and neuroimaging [^96a10047]. Neurosurgery (2011). Low credibility.

During the 1930s, white matter tracts began to assume relevance for neurosurgery, especially after Cajal's work. In many reviews of white matter neurobiology, the seminal contributions of Josef Klingler (1888–1963) and their neurological applications have been overlooked. In 1934 at the University of Basel under Eugen Ludwig, Klingler developed a new method of dissection based on a freezing technique for brain tissue that eloquently revealed the white matter tracts. Klingler worked with anatomists, surgeons, and other scientists, and his models and dissections of white matter tracts remain arguably the most elegant ever created. He stressed 3-dimensional anatomic relationships and laid the foundation for defining mesial temporal, limbic, insular, and thalamic fiber and functional relationships and contributed to the potential of stereotactic neurosurgery. Around 1947, Klingler was part of a Swiss-German group that independently performed the first stereotactic thalamotomies, basing their targeting and logic on Klingler's white matter studies, describing various applications of stereotaxy and showing Klingler's work integrated into a craniocerebral topographic system for targeting with external localization of eloquent brain structures and stimulation of deep thalamic nuclei. Klingler's work has received renewed interest because it is applicable for correlating the results of the fiber-mapping paradigms from diffusion tensor imaging to actual anatomic evidence. Although others have described white matter tracts, none have had as much practical impact on neuroscience as Klinger's work. More importantly, Josef Klingler was an encouraging mentor, influencing neurosurgeons, neuroscientists, and brain imaging for more than three quarters of a century.

### The personal and scientific feud between ernst Brücke and josef hyrtl [^bdc136ce]. Otology & Neurotology (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the events surrounding the personal and professional feud between Josef Hyrtl and Ernst Brücke and its impact on early investigations into the function of the semicircular canals of the inner ear.

Data Sources

Published data in scientific journals and news media, documents at the Vienna Institute for the History of Medicine, published personal letters, and an interview with Brücke's great-grandson, Dr. Thomas Brücke.

Conclusion

Although Hyrtl was instrumental in recruiting Brücke to the University of Vienna, the two professors soon became embroiled in a feud that persisted throughout their academic careers. The difference in approach of these two giants in their field is well illustrated by their views on the function of the semicircular canals of the inner ear. Based on their shape, Hyrtl concluded that they were important for directional hearing, whereas based on animal experiments, Brücke concluded that they were sense organs for equilibrium.

### Regional cooling caused recent New Zealand glacier advances in a period of global warming [^7d186cc6]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Figure 5b shows that the modelled glacier volume increased at Franz Josef Glacier almost continuously from 1983 to 1999, and again between 2005 and 2008. The model also simulates a period of mass loss in the late 1990s and early 2000s that corresponded with observed terminus retreat. There is a 2–3 year time lag between glacier volume changes simulated by the model, and length changes recorded at Franz Josef Glacier. This time lag is similar to the 3–4 year terminus 'reaction time' estimated for Franz Josef Glacier based on terminus observations. Overall, these results provide confidence that our mass balance model is simulating the major processes, both in space and time, that forced New Zealand glacier mass balance changes between 1972 and 2011.

### The enigma of gerstmann's syndrome revisited: a telling tale of the vicissitudes of neuropsychology [^f1e2be61]. Brain (2010). Low credibility.

Eighty years ago, the Austrian neurologist Josef Gerstmann observed in a few patients a concomitant impairment in discriminating their own fingers, writing by hand, distinguishing left from right and performing calculations. He claimed that this tetrad of symptoms constituted a syndromal entity, assigned it to a lesion of the dominant parietal lobe and suggested that it was due to damage of a common functional denominator. Ever since, these claims have been debated and an astute synopsis and sceptical discussion was presented 40 years ago by MacDonald Critchley in this journal. Nonetheless, Gerstmann's syndrome has continued to intrigue both clinical neurologists and researchers in neuropsychology, and more frequently than not is described in textbooks as an example of parietal lobe damage. In this review, we revisit the chequered history of this syndrome, which can be seen as a case study of the dialectic evolution of concepts in neuropsychology. In light of several modern era findings of pure cases we conclude that it is legitimate to label the conjunction of symptoms first described by Gerstmann as a 'syndrome', but that it is very unlikely that damage to the same population of cortical neurons should account for all of the four symptoms. Instead, we propose that a pure form of Gerstmann's syndrome might arise from disconnection, via a lesion, to separate but co-localized fibre tracts in the subcortical parietal white matter, a hypothesis for which we have recently provided evidence using combined imaging of functional and structural organization in the healthy brain.

### Children's experiences of meals after obesity treatment: a qualitative follow-up four years after a randomized controlled trial [^e5d44a27]. BMC Pediatrics (2022). Medium credibility.

Connected to the social composition around the meal were the routines of places where the meals were eaten. Children described household rules about where eating was or was not allowed, with the kitchen table being the usual place where children had their main meals. Emma and Ebba said they were not allowed to eat on the sofa, exemplifying awareness of explicit rules set by parents. More commonly, however, children described flexibility in eating spaces, for the family as a collective, for a certain family member, or for the interviewed child. Like Josef:

In the living room and in our room we usually [sit and eat]. In your room? Yeah. Where do you prefer to sit? Do you think that… In my room. In your room, what do you do then? Do you do anything [else] while eating? I watch and put on a movie. (Josef)

David expressed the opposite preference, saying that his family's sporadic living room meals were cumbersome due to the extra work involved in moving things to and from the kitchen. Gabriel's whole family had their Friday dinner in front of the TV, while Edith's family did the same thing when watching movies, although she said that the best place to have dinner was her room. Thus, certain places to eat also implied solitary meals for the children. In addition, families' eating spaces could include venues outside the home. August's, Saga's, and Edith's families went to restaurants on weekends, and Märta said she enjoyed outdoor summer picnics with her family.

Children demonstrated an awareness of how places were connected to everyday routines and special occasions. When special occasions were described, children also spoke about the foods eaten. Maja was allowed sweets and snacks on Saturdays, and Saga's restaurant visits included "hamburgers and stuff" as well as "rice and meat and stuff." Märta said family picnics included barbecues, as well as "salad and donuts and stuff." Alma's parents normally decided what to eat, but she was allowed to decide with her sister "on Fridays for example." This was the case on the day of the interview:

### Regional cooling caused recent New Zealand glacier advances in a period of global warming [^b991c34b]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Glaciers are iconic indicators of climate change, and understanding their anthropogenic and natural drivers is critical for anticipating future sea-level rise and freshwater security. Monitoring of terminus positions for ∼500 glaciers worldwide has revealed a largely homogeneous trend of retreat during the late twentieth and early twenty first centuries. Unprecedented global ice loss has occurred during the last three decades, which are the warmest of the instrumental era. The predominantly negative global glacier mass balance between 1991 and 2010 has been primarily attributed to anthropogenically-forced warming. Examples of glacier stability and expansion during this period that are attributable to climate, rather than to internal glacier dynamics, are confined to just a few regions such as the Karakoram and Pamir, western Scandinavia, southern Patagoniaand the Southern Alps of New Zealand.

A number of glaciers in New Zealand recently exhibited a globally exceptional period of terminus advance (Figs 1 and 2). The World Glacier Monitoring Service database shows that 58 glaciers advanced at some point in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s (refs,), and 12 of these glaciers advanced continuously for five or more years. In 2005, when this glacier advance phase neared its end, 15 of the 26 advancing glaciers observed worldwide were in New Zealand. Franz Josef, the glacier with the most complete length change record in the Southern Hemisphere, advanced for 19 of the 25 years between 1983 and 2008, regaining almost half (1.4 km) of the ∼3 km length it lost between 1893 and 1982 (ref.; Fig. 2). We use the length record at Franz Josef Glacier to define the period of climate forcing associated with this glacier advance phase. By taking into account the ∼3-year time lag between climate forcing and terminus response observed at Franz Josef Glacier, we suggest that the corresponding climate period extended from 1980 to 2005.

### The man behind the eponym: hans biberstein and follicular hyperplasia overlying dermatofibroma [^38ccc39f]. The American Journal of Dermatopathology (2009). Low credibility.

Hans Biberstein first described the basaloid follicular hyperplasia overlying dermatofibromas in 1923 and published his extensive observations on the subject in 1931. Part of Josef Jadassohn's department in Breslau, he was forced to leave German by the National Socialist regime and spent the rest of his career in New York. After a hiatus of 30 years, the dermatopathologic literature once again began addressing his seminal finding but never gave him proper credit. We suggest Biberstein's sign as an appropriate term for basaloid follicular hyperplasia overlying a dermatofibroma and as a small tribute to a pioneer dermatopathologist.

### Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors: lack of a complete history delays diagnosis [^c8523a12]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

On 15 May 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned that administration of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors could lead to ketoacidosis in patients with diabetes mellitus. This announcement came more than 2 years after the FDA's first approval of an SGLT2 inhibitor, although the phenomenon had been known for more than 125 years. Luminaries of diabetes research (including Josef von Mering, Frederick Allen, I. Arthur Mirsky, and George Cahill) had described ketosis and ketoacidosis induced by administration of the phytochemical phlorizin, the prototypical SGLT inhibitor, as well as in patients with familial renal glucosuria, a condition that is considered a natural model of SGLT2 inhibition. Neither government regulators nor manufacturers of SGLT2 inhibitors evinced an awareness of this extensive historical record. The absence of historical inquiry delayed notice of ketoacidosis as an adverse reaction, which could have reduced the burden of illness from these drugs.

### Pseudoachondroplasia and the seven ovitz siblings who survived auschwitz [^c8b72737]. Pediatric Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

This historical report focuses on the first clinical description of pseudoachondroplasia and its radiographic findings. Only half a century ago, pseudoachondroplasia was recognized as a genetic disorder with a distinct but variable phenotype of short stature, normal facial features, and progressive joint problems starting in adolescence. Radiologically, the disease is particularly intriguing because the patients appear normal at birth. The patients develop the typical gait disturbances when they begin to walk. Radiographs show the characteristic anterior tongue-shaped lumbar vertebral body changes that develop after the first year of life. This account presents the most well-known group of individuals affected by pseudoachondroplasia, the Ovitz family, who narrowly escaped death in the concentration camp of Auschwitz in 1944 because of SS physician Dr. Josef Mengele's fascination with dwarfs. It was not until 1995 that the underlying genetic defect in the COMP gene was identified on chromosome 19.

### Regional cooling caused recent New Zealand glacier advances in a period of global warming [^a6a2358c]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Glaciers experienced worldwide retreat during the twentieth and early twenty first centuries, and the negative trend in global glacier mass balance since the early 1990s is predominantly a response to anthropogenic climate warming. The exceptional terminus advance of some glaciers during recent global warming is thought to relate to locally specific climate conditions, such as increased precipitation. In New Zealand, at least 58 glaciers advanced between 1983 and 2008, and Franz Josef and Fox glaciers advanced nearly continuously during this time. Here we show that the glacier advance phase resulted predominantly from discrete periods of reduced air temperature, rather than increased precipitation. The lower temperatures were associated with anomalous southerly winds and low sea surface temperature in the Tasman Sea region. These conditions result from variability in the structure of the extratropical atmospheric circulation over the South Pacific. While this sequence of climate variability and its effect on New Zealand glaciers is unusual on a global scale, it remains consistent with a climate system that is being modified by humans.

### Vertebral body infarction indicating midthoracic spinal stroke [^17b5fe7c]. Spinal Cord (2002). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case report.

Objective

To illustrate the significance of vertebral body infarction as the only confirmatory sign of spinal cord ischemic stroke.

Setting

Department of Neurology, St. Josef-Hospital, Bochum, Germany.

Case Description

A 65-year-old man presented with clinical features suggesting spontaneous spinal cord infarction in the territory of the left sulcocommissural artery at the level of Th 8. Sequential magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) investigations failed to demonstrate infarction of the spinal cord but T2-weighted images revealed bone marrow hyperintensities of vertebra Th 9 and 10 in their left and dorsal parts consistent with vertebral body infarction.

Conclusion

In clinically presumed spontaneous spinal cord infarction and unremarkable signaling of the spinal cord during sequential MRI investigations vertebral body infarction may serve as the only confirmatory sign of spinal cord ischemic stroke.

### Regional cooling caused recent New Zealand glacier advances in a period of global warming [^0243174b]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Figure 4a shows simulated annual mass balance for the standard run for the largest glaciers in our domain. This simulation shows a large degree of interannual variability in glacier mass balance. Particularly negative mass balance years are simulated in 1990, 1999 and 2000. However, sustained periods of positive mass balance are also simulated, in particular during the mid-1980s, in the early to mid-1990s and in the mid-2000s. New Zealand lacks long-term measurements of glacier mass balance to compare directly to this simulation. However, annual snowlines on a number of Southern Alps glaciers (Supplementary Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table 3) have been surveyed by oblique aerial photography at the end of each glacier year (austral summer, typically in March) since 1976 (refs). Our simulated glacier mass balance anomalies and these recently measured annual snowlines are strongly positively correlated (r = 0.69, P < 0.01), suggesting that the modelled year-to-year variability is realistic (Fig. 5a).

Simulated glacier mass balance varies significantly between glaciers within our model domain. Our modelling suggests that large, low-angle glaciers such as Tasman and Murchison (Fig. 3) experienced mostly negative mass balance and overall ice volume loss during this period (Fig. 4). This is consistent with observations that these glaciers have been losing volume between 1972 and 2011. In contrast, Fox and Franz Josef Glaciers show overall positive glacier mass balance, and gain volume in this 39-year simulation, also consistent with observations(Fig. 4). Because glacier length has been monitored closely at Franz Josef Glacier, and also because it can respond to climate variability within a few years, the record of terminus fluctuations at Franz Josef provides a key target for comparison with our simulated glacier volume.

### The empirical basis for modelling glacial erosion rates [^e3abc50f]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

A value of l that is < 1 implies a rate of increase in erosion that is lower than the rate of increase in sliding. This finding is consistent with hard-bed sliding theories that predict a decrease in ice-bed contact as greater sliding speeds cause the size of cavities formed in the lee of bedrock obstacles to increase. A similar negative feedback is evident in certain theoretical treatments of quarrying, which also find that the value of l should be < 1. Nonetheless, the value of l from our dataset differs greatly from that obtained using robust, longitudinally distributed measurements of sliding and bedrock erosion at the non-surging Franz Josef Glacier(i.e. l ≈ 2). We note, however, that (1) the data from Franz Josef Glacier lie within the broad envelope of our data set (Fig. 2a; Supplementary Table 2), and (2) our study employs a different approach whereby we have used single sliding velocity values and average erosion rate estimates for each glacier in the dataset. We believe that the latter difference critically affects estimation of l because the mechanics of sliding and erosion are anticipated to vary along the typical glacier longitudinal profile, yielding a non-linear relationship between sliding and erosion rate. Specifically, it is likely that conditions for erosion are optimised in the upper ablation area, just below the ELA, where ice is thick and seasonal surface melt forms subglacial channels that flush sediment whilst also promoting diurnally high basal water pressures that stimulate the highest sliding rates. Erosion rates elsewhere along the glacier profile should be much lower. In the accumulation zone, low volumes of surface melt should reduce sliding and sediment flushing rates. In the ablation area generally, sediment flushing and erosion are greater, but in the lower ablation zone, thinner ice and lower mean basal water pressures, due to the increased efficiency of subglacial channels, yields lower sliding velocities, thus moderating the rate of erosion. Hence, sliding-erosion rate data for individual glaciers should typically plot on a steeper, non-linear gradient than that defined by spatially averaged values from many glacial catchments, which integrate the longitudinal variations envisaged here. Thus, our study is consistent with studies of individual glaciers which yield higher values of l. These relationships are summarised in Fig. 2b.

### Unique genomic landscape of high-grade neuroendocrine cervical carcinoma: implications for rethinking current treatment paradigms | JCO precision oncology… [^03bfdda0]. ASCO (2020). Medium credibility.

Seventy-one patients had ≥ 1 alteration that was theoretically druggable. Comparing HGNECC with SCLC, significant differences in TMB, microsatellite instability, HPV-positive status, and in PIK3CA, MYC, PTEN, TP53, ARID1A, and RB1alteration rates were found. 9, 10To better understand these responses and to identify molecular aberrations underlying this uncommon malignancy, we examined the genomic landscape of HGNECC. Here, we report the identified molecular alterations in a cohort of HGNECC specimens, several of which may serve as actionable therapeutic targets, and compare the genomic landscape of this disease to the histologically similar SCLC, which has been historically used to model treatment of HGNECC. 11The pathologic diagnosis of each case was confirmed on routine hematoxylin- and eosin-stained slides and all samples forwarded for DNA extraction contained a minimum of 20% tumor nuclear area.

Microsatellite instability status was evaluable in 75 HGNECC and 1, 573 SCLC cases. Principal components analysis is used to produce an NGS-based MSI score. There was no need to extend beyond the first principal component, because it explained approximately 50% of the total data variance, whereas none of the other principal components explained > 4% each. Ranges of the MSI score were assigned MSI-High, MSI ambiguous, or microsatellite stable. Tumor Mutational Burden The number of somatic mutations detected on NGS were quantified and that value extrapolated to the whole exome, using a validated algorithm. Human Papillomavirus Detection In addition, the presence of high-risk human papillomavirus was examined in submitted specimens, as previously reported. 16Hybrid-capture reagents included baits designed to capture unique regions of select viral genomes including HPV-16 and -18.

Sequence read pairs were aligned to the reference genome of the respective viral genomes, and the number of pairs mapping to each viral genome was counted. A total HPV-16/18 aligned read count of ≥ 5 reads per million was considered a positive HPV status, and < 5 reads per million was considered HPV not detected.
16. MSH2alterations. Two of the 3 cases were both MSI-H and TMB-H and harbored the highest numbers of identifiable GAs in the cohort. 17, 18The third case, with a nonsense mutation near the 3′ end of the coding sequence, was MSS and TMB-L. The 2 MSH-2–mutant MSI-H cases were both of small-cell histology and accounted for all MSI-H cases out of the 75 cases of HGNECC with evaluable microsatellite status. Furthermore, a total of 40 patient samples harbored mutations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway; mutations in PIK3CAwere identified in 47. 5% of these samples, and PTENmutations were reported in 35%. Last, 7 patients had mutations in the ERBB pathway, with ERBB2mutations occurring in tumors of 4 individuals. Interestingly, the frequency and distribution of GAs identified in this cohort of patients are similar and distinct from mutational patterns described in the more common HPV-related cervical cancer histologies. Furthermore, mutations affecting the NOTCHpathway were identified in 25% of the examined SCLC samples; the NOTCHpathway is hypothesized to function as a regulator of neuroendocrine differentiation. In our examined HGNECC cohort, only 7 patients had NOTCHalterations. Finally, HPV positivity was discerned in 85. 6% of our HGNECC samples, but in only
0. 01% of our SCLC samples.

### Regional cooling caused recent New Zealand glacier advances in a period of global warming [^ad415107]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Glacier mass balance measurements made at Franz Josef and Tasman glaciers are used to tune and evaluate the glacier mass balance model. The model is also evaluated against annual glacier snowlines in the Southern Alps (a proxy for the glacier equilibrium line altitude) estimated from oblique aerial photographs since 1976 (Fig. 5), and the length change record at Franz Josef Glacier(Figs 2 and 5).

Overall, 1,035 direct glacier mass balance measurements made at Franz Josef and Tasman glaciers between 1972 and 2011 are used to tune and evaluate the glacier mass balance model. In all, 455 of these mass balance measurements on Franz Josef Glacier between 1 April 2000 and 31 March 2002 are used in model tuning, while 580 measurements from before, and after, this tuning period provides an independent assessment of model performance. Overall, agreement between modelled and measured mass balance is excellent (Supplementary Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 2). The comparison of modelled and measured accumulation also provides a secondary test of the precipitation input data.

Additional model runs were conducted to ensure the results from our diagnostic experiments were not unduly influenced by model parameter choices; the range of output values that resulted from the range of parameter choices given in Supplementary Table 1 is the blue and red uncertainty bands for precipitation and temperature, respectively, in Fig. 6d. Repeat model simulations using statistically downscaled re-analysis temperature (rather than interpolated station data) showed similar patterns (Supplementary Fig. 4) and fall within the uncertainty bounds generated using different model parameter sets (Fig. 6d).

To evaluate the influence of our simple debris-cover ablation-reduction scheme and our assumption of glacier surfaces always being at the melting point, we tested this simple scheme against our full subsurface and debris conduction calculations using the same model experiments (Supplementary Fig. 4). We found that the more complete thermal calculations gave a very similar result to our simplified analysis. Including conductive melt under debris, and subsurface heat fluxes in snow and ice, the contribution of temperature variations to volume changes is generally decreased, while the contribution of precipitation variations to volume changes is close to zero over the full period. The contribution of other variables also changes, but remains minor.

### Effects of yoga in men with prostate cancer on quality of life and immune response: a pilot randomized controlled trial [^f43849a2]. Prostate Cancer and Prostatic Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Although there have been some small retrospective studies and one relevant randomized trial, the effects of yoga in patients with prostate cancer remain unclear, particularly regarding QoL and its molecular impact. Therefore, we designed this clinical trial to obtain preliminary clinical and translational data.

Our preliminary data add to the literature by providing a molecular explanation for the similar improvements in QoL seen in patients with prostate cancer. The greatest impact of yoga was on sexual function, fatigue, prostate cancer-specific QoL, and physical, social, and functional wellbeing. Our data also indicate that yoga modulates several key immune cells that are important drivers of antitumor activity. Furthermore, the analysis of cytokines/chemokines suggests that yoga attenuates the inflammatory response.

Our data demonstrate a positive effect of yoga in several clinical domains. First, we observed a significant improvement in QoL in the perioperative setting, which was reflected in enhanced physical, social, and functional wellbeing as well as improvement in symptoms of fatigue and stress. These findings are consistent with those of a trial by Ben-Josef et al. in which 50 patients with prostate cancer undergoing radiation therapy were allocated to yoga classes (n = 22) or standard-of-care (n = 28) for 6–9 weeks. In that study, patients in the yoga group experienced significantly less global fatigue and severity of fatigue than those in the control group (p < 0.0001). Moreover, as in our study, sexual health scores were better in their yoga group. Overall, our data and those of Ben-Josef et al. demonstrate that yoga has a positive effect on emotional, physical, and social scores.

### History of cerebral localization and the emigration plight of three neuroscience giants from nazi Germany: josef gerstmann, adolf wallenberg, and franz josef kallmann [^534690ed]. Neurosurgical Focus (2019). Medium credibility.

The Nazi regime held power for well over a decade in Germany and were steadfast in their anti-Semitic agenda. Among the massive cohort of immigrants to America were approximately 5056 Jewish physicians, including several highly esteemed neurologists and neuroscientists of the time. Emigrating to a new world proved difficult and provided new challenges by way of language barriers, roadblocks in medical careers, and problems integrating into an alien system of medical training and clinical practice. In this article, the authors examine the tumultuous and accomplished lives of three Jewish German and Austrian neurologists and neuroscientists during the time of the Third Reich who shaped the foundations of neuroanatomy and neuropsychology: Josef Gerstmann, Adolf Wallenberg, and Franz Josef Kallmann. The authors first examine the successful careers of these individuals in Germany and Austria prior to the Third Reich, followed by their journeys to and lives in the United States, to demonstrate the challenges an émigré physician faces for career opportunities and a chance at a new life. This account culminates in a description of these scientists' eponymous syndromes. Although their stories are a testimony to the struggles in Nazi Germany, there are intriguing and notable differences in their ages, ideologies, and religious beliefs, which highlight a spectrum of unique circumstances that impacted their success in the United States. Furthermore, in this account the authors bring to light the original syndromic descriptions: Gerstmann discovered contralateral agraphia and acalculia, right-left confusion, and finger agnosia in patients with dominant angular gyrus damage; Wallenberg described a constellation of symptoms in a patient with stenosis of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery; and Kallmann identified an association between hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia based on family studies. The article also highlights the unresolved confusions and international controversies about these syndromic descriptions. Still, these unique cerebral syndromes continue to fascinate neurologists and neurosurgeons across the world, from residents in training to practicing clinicians and neuroscientists alike.

### Benefit of primary and secondary prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillator in elderly patients [^8472c8cd]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The present study investigated the benefit of ICD implantation in different subgroups of patients. Benefit of ICD implantation was defined as appropriate ICD therapy resulting in prolonged survival. In contrast, no benefit was assumed if patients died without a prior appropriate ICD therapy. In our study, which included all ICD implantations at St. Josef Hospital from 2011 to 2020, an age‐dependent benefit of ICD implantation was observed in the group of patients with primary prophylactic ICD indication.

The most important finding of the study is that in the group of patients over 80 years of age, no patients benefited from ICD implantation, which was partly due to high mortality. In contrast, all age groups in the secondary prophylactic ICD indication group demonstrated a relevant proportion of patients with a benefit of ICD implantation (Figure 2).

### Mengele's suitcase [^b36db961]. Clinics in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

On January 9, 2014, I received a call at my home in the small town of Alfeld (Leine), Central Germany. On the phone was Barbara Riepl, an acquaintance from Munich, and she had a truly exciting story waiting for me. 1 The grandfather of her best friend Nicole had been a prominent Hungarian Jew who had been deported to Auschwitz during World War II. There, he became a prisoner doctor forced to assist the notorious Nazi doctor Josef Mengele in his infamous human experiments. Several years after the war, he deposited a slew of documents in a Swiss safe. That safe had remained untouched for decades, but it was to be unsealed soon. Riepl went on to claim that her friend had entrusted her personally with these documents and asked if I, as a historian, would be interested in examining the documents and-if need arose-help to publish them.

### Gerstmann, sträussler, and scheinker: the persecution of the men behind the syndrome [^7b595bfb]. Neurology (2014). Low credibility.

In 1936, Austrian neuroscientists Josef Gerstmann and Ernst Sträussler, along with expatriate Russian neuroscientist Ilya Mark Scheinker, described the familial prion disorder later named for them from a case they mutually treated at a Viennese neurologic hospital. In 1938, Austria was annexed to Nazi Germany in the Anschluss, effectively ending any collaboration between the 3 men. Gerstmann and Scheinker eventually immigrated to America, and Sträussler, although dismissed from his faculty position, remained protected from persecution in Vienna throughout the war likely because of his marriage to an "Aryan woman". Although he attained some degree of success in exile, Gerstmann was never again director of a hospital and primarily maintained a private practice after some brief consulting positions in New York in the 1940s. His medical degree was retroactively stripped by the Nazis without his knowledge, and was not reinstated until 1955. Gerstmann also became embroiled in a bitter struggle to regain his confiscated property in Vienna. Scheinker, aided by the refugee resettlement committee, settled in Cincinnati where he had several successful years and published 3 textbooks, but was denied university tenure and entered private practice until his untimely death. All 3 neurologists lost significant career momentum, and had to pick up the pieces of their fractured lives after the war or their forced exile. Their stories reflect many of the tragic realities of Nazi persecution of Jewish physicians.

### Regional cooling caused recent New Zealand glacier advances in a period of global warming [^d700af6c]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Climate models do not fully reproduce the form or the timing of the distinct Southern Hemisphere regional atmospheric meridional airflow anomaliesthat drive large interannual variations in New Zealand temperature, and Southern Alps glacier mass balance. Future projections of New Zealand climate, and hence glacier mass balance, are unlikely to be accurate on decadal timescales unless models capture this behaviour. The twentieth and early twenty first century behaviour of Franz Josef Glacier provides useful context for considering future predictions. Franz Josef Glacier retreated by more than 3 km during the twentieth century, in response to a warming of ∼1 °C. It also experienced several discrete periods of glacier advance during this period, including the episode that we focus on in this paper (Fig. 2). Extrapolating forwards, this could mean that the future rate of ice loss could be enhanced, reduced or even temporarily reversed, depending on how regional climate drivers interact with projected centennial-scale warming. However, if anthropogenic forcing becomes dominant during the twenty first century as projected and Southern Alps temperature increases by 2 °C or more, significant Southern Alps ice loss is inevitable. The dramatic retreat of Fox and Franz Josef glaciers since 2011 may be the first sign of this rapid mass loss. Finally, we suggest that future warming of the Tasman Sea, such as that experienced in the austral summer of 2015/2016 (ref.), will lead to enhanced rates of ice loss, due to the close relationship between Tasman Sea surface temperature and New Zealand glacier mass balance demonstrated here.

In conclusion, we have shown that several discrete periods of reduced air temperature in the Southern Alps resulted from regional-scale climate variation over the South Pacific. This caused some New Zealand glaciers to advance between 1983 and 2008, during a period of anthropogenically forced climate warming, global-scale glacier retreat and overall ice volume loss in the Southern Alps. Our work calls into question other studies where it was concluded that precipitation increase has driven glacier advances in recent decades. There is a need to carry out similar diagnostic modelling work in locations where the underlying drivers of glacier advance conditions are not well understood. Continued long-term monitoring of glacier mass balance, and high-elevation mountain climate, is also essential.

### Muscle involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection [^febb8d92]. European Journal of Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

METHODS

SARS‐CoV‐2 cohort

Patient records from three designated COVID‐19 treatment centres, the University Hospital Innsbruck, St. Vincent Hospital Zams and Kaiser Franz Josef Hospital Vienna, were retrospectively analysed. The study is part of a larger study of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and was approved the Ethics committees of the Medical University Innsbruck (EKNR 1167‐2020) and the Kaiser Franz Josef Hospital (EK 20‐079‐VK).

Values for CK, C‐reactive protein (CRP), white cell blood (WBC) count, procalcitonin, interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) and ferritin were obtained at the day of hospitalisation (baseline), day 7 (± 2 days) and day 14 (± 2 days), when available. Patients were included into the study when at least one CK value (i.e. at baseline, day 7 or day 14) was available. HyperCKemia was defined as CK exceeding the upper limit of normal (> 190 U/L in males and > 170 U/L in females).

Known pre‐existing factors affecting disease severity were recorded: diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary heart disease (CHD), arterial hypertension and chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD). Also, the use of statins was recorded as a possible confounder for CK elevations. Disease severity was classified based on admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality, respectively. Various treatments have been used: hydrochloroquine in 44, favipiravir in 18, ropinavir/ritonavir in 15, and remdesivir in one patient. Muscle biopsies were not performed.

Influenza cohort

For comparison, demographic information, comorbidities, CK and CRP values from patients diagnosed with influenza at the University Hospital Innsbruck were extracted from anonymised patient records. Data on treatment were not available.

### From trench mouth to noma: experiences from nazi extermination camps [^3bbfb4fa]. Clinics in Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Trench mouth, as it occurred especially in World War I in soldiers, is a necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (NUG) in people who have poor oral hygiene, malnutrition, vitamin deficiency, a smoking history, and psychic stress. When not treated properly, this condition can lead to noma. NUG and noma are mainly seen today in severely malnourished, poorly cared for, and immunocompromised children in extremely poor living conditions, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. In 20th century history, the occurrence of noma in Turkey was described by Albert Eckstein (1891–1959), but noma is particularly linked to the atrocious living conditions in the Nazi exterminations camps, such as Auschwitz, where large numbers of patients with noma were treated in Berthold Epstein's (1890–1962) Noma Department in the Zigeunerlager (Gypsy Camp) under the supervision of SS physician Josef Mengele (1911–1979). Although these patients were treated successfully, all of them, mostly children, were ultimately killed. The protocols of the noma research are lost, and descriptions from Auschwitz are scarce. Fortuitously, there are some testimonies, especially from postwar trials, that give insight on this ambiguous and repressed topic.

### Premature aging of leukocyte DNA methylation is associated with type 2 diabetes prevalence [^4b9b26fc]. Clinical Epigenetics (2015). Low credibility.

Subjects and population cohorts

The EJP sample of the Jerusalem Palestinian-Israeli Risk Factor Study was described in detail elsewhere. Briefly, an age-sex-stratified random sample of 2,000 Palestinian Arabs aged 25 to 77, residents of East Jerusalem, was drawn from the Israel national population registry (in which EJPs with the legal status of permanent residents of Israel are recorded). Of these 70.5% could be located. After exclusion of those not meeting the eligibility criteria (10.4%), 970 EJPs were examined (response rate of 76.7% among those located), and 929 were successfully analyzed for methylation levels. Participants were recruited between 2005 and 2008 at the St. Josef Hospital in East Jerusalem for face-to-face interviews and clinical measurements performed by trained personnel. The interview included sociodemographic characteristics and information about health behaviors and health status. All subjects provided signed informed consent. The study was approved by the St. Josef Hospital and Hadassah Medical Center Ethics (Helsinki) Committees and the Israel Ministry of Health National Review Board for Genetic Studies.
Participants in the cross-sectional case–control study were Israeli residents of Jewish Ashkenazi origin (four grandparents): T2D subjects (n = 281) were ascertained by the Israel Diabetes Research Group, were treated for T2D, and were at least 10 years post-diagnosed at the time of DNA collection, as previously described. The control group (n = 348) comprised non-diabetic subjects with parents free of diabetes that were drawn from three sources: the Israel Diabetes Research Group (n = 188), the Jerusalem Perinatal Study (n = 96), and people undergoing health screening examinations at a hospital-based clinic (n = 64). In contrast with a previous report that included controls aged 40 to 70 years from these same sources, here the age was unrestricted and included subjects aged 11 to 92 years. DNA samples obtained from peripheral white blood cells were analyzed anonymously. All subjects provided signed informed consent. The study was approved by the Hadassah Medical Center Helsinki Review Committee, the Shaare Zedek Medical Center Helsinki Review Committee, and the Israeli National Helsinki Committee for Genetic Studies.

### The tripartite origins of the tonic neck reflex: gesell, gerstmann, and magnus [^036fba5d]. Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

The standard neurologic examination of the newborn and infant includes the elicitation of the tonic neck reflex. Normally present, its persistence is suggestive of neurologic dysfunction and a prognostic marker highly suggestive of an adverse outcome. Working in different fields, with different approaches and largely independently, three leaders of early 20th century neurosciences (Rudolf Magnus, Josef Gerstmann, and Arnold Gesell) elaborated different aspects of this primitive reflex. Magnus provided the first description in an animal model utilizing a meticulously prepared decerebrate cat correctly identifying the reflex's reliance on proprioceptors in the neck and processing in the upper cervical segment. Gerstmann first described its occurrence in the setting of neurologic disease, providing a meticulous written description in an early description of the index case of what would later be eponymously designated Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome. Gesell initially described the reflex's fundamental occurrence in normal young infants, highlighting its adaptive role in early development and its persistence as a hallmark of neurologic pathology.

2.2 Recommended Dosage

The recommended cumulative dosage of MAVENCLAD is 3.5 mg per kg body weight administered orally and divided into 2 yearly treatment courses (1.75 mg per kg per treatment course) (see Table 1). Each treatment course is divided into 2 treatment cycles:

Administration of First Treatment Course

First Course/First Cycle: start any time.
First Course/Second Cycle: administer 23 to 27 days after the last dose of First Course/First Cycle.

Administration of Second Treatment Course

Second Course/First Cycle: administer at least 43 weeks after the last dose of First Course/Second Cycle.
Second Course/Second Cycle: administer 23 to 27 days after the last dose of Second Course/First Cycle.

Administer the cycle dosage as 1 or 2 tablets once daily over 4 or 5 consecutive days [see How Supplied/Storage and Handling (16.1)]. Do not administer more than 2 tablets daily.

Following the administration of 2 treatment courses, do not administer additional MAVENCLAD treatment during the next 2 years. Treatment during these 2 years may further increase the risk of malignancy [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. The safety and efficacy of reinitiating MAVENCLAD more than 2 years after completing 2 treatment courses has not been studied.

2.3 Missed Dose

If a dose is missed, patients should not take double or extra doses.

If a dose is not taken on the scheduled day, then the patient must take the missed dose on the following day and extend the number of days in that treatment cycle. If two consecutive doses are missed, the treatment cycle is extended by 2 days.

2.4 Administration

MAVENCLAD tablets are taken orally, with water, and swallowed whole without chewing. MAVENCLAD can be taken with or without food.

Separate administration of MAVENCLAD and any other oral drugs by at least 3 hours during the 4 to 5 day MAVENCLAD treatment cycles [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)].

MAVENCLAD is a cytotoxic drug. Follow applicable special handling and disposal procedures [see References (15)]. MAVENCLAD is an uncoated tablet and must be swallowed immediately once removed from the blister. If a tablet is left on a surface, or if a broken or fragmented tablet is released from the blister, the area must be thoroughly washed with water.

The patient's hands must be dry when handling the tablets and washed thoroughly afterwards. Avoid prolonged contact with skin.

### Aripiprazole (Opipza) [^6f7d0fbc]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adults

The efficacy of aripiprazole in the treatment of schizophrenia was evaluated in five short-term (4 week and 6 week), placebo-controlled trials of acutely relapsed inpatients who predominantly met DSM-III/IV criteria for schizophrenia. Four of the five trials were able to distinguish aripiprazole from placebo, but one study, the smallest, did not. Three of these studies also included an active control group consisting of either risperidone (one trial) or haloperidol (two trials), but they were not designed to allow for a comparison of aripiprazole and the active comparators.

In the four positive trials for aripiprazole, four primary measures were used for assessing psychiatric signs and symptoms. Efficacy was evaluated using the total score on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The PANSS is a 30 item scale that measures positive symptoms of schizophrenia (7 items), negative symptoms of schizophrenia (7 items), and general psychopathology (16 items), each rated on a scale of 1 (absent) to 7 (extreme); total PANSS scores range from 30 to 210. The Clinical Global Impression (CGI) assessment reflects the impression of a skilled observer, fully familiar with the manifestations of schizophrenia, about the overall clinical state of the patient.

In a 4 week trial (n = 414) comparing two fixed doses of aripiprazole (15 or 30 mg/day) to placebo, both doses of aripiprazole were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score (Study 1 in Table 26), PANSS positive subscale, and CGI-severity score. In addition, the 15 mg dose was superior to placebo in the PANSS negative subscale.
In a 4 week trial (n = 404) comparing two fixed doses of aripiprazole (20 or 30 mg/day) to placebo, both doses of aripiprazole were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score (Study 2 in Table 26), PANSS positive subscale, PANSS negative subscale, and CGI- severity score.
In a 6 week trial (n = 420) comparing three fixed doses of aripiprazole (10, 15, or 20 mg/day) to placebo, all three doses of aripiprazole were superior to placebo in the PANSS total score (Study 3 in Table 26), PANSS positive subscale, and the PANSS negative subscale.
In a 6 week trial (n = 367) comparing three fixed doses of aripiprazole (2, 5, or 10 mg/day) to placebo, the 10 mg dose of aripiprazole was superior to placebo in the PANSS total score (Study 4 in Table 26), the primary outcome measure of the study. The 2 and 5 mg doses did not demonstrate superiority to placebo on the primary outcome measure.

### Oliceridine (Olinvyk) [^e9d9c17b]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.5 Potential for QT prolongation with Daily Doses
exceeding 27 mg

The effect of oliceridine on cardiac physiology was studied in single and multiple-dose thorough QT studies. The multiple-dose study was conducted with a maximum daily cumulative dose of 27 mg. In both studies, there was mild QTc interval prolongation. In the multiple-dose study, the maximum mean ΔΔQTcI was 11.7 ms (two-sided 90% UCI 14.7 ms) at 9 hours. The effect on QT prolongation at total cumulative daily doses > 27 mg has not been studied in a thorough QT study [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)]. Total cumulative daily doses exceeding 27 mg per day may increase the risk for QTc interval prolongation. Therefore, the cumulative total daily dose of OLINVYK should not exceed 27 mg [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)].

5.6 Risk
of Use in Patients with Decreased Cytochrome P450 2D6 Function or Concomitant
Use or Discontinuation with Cytochrome P450 3A4 Inhibitors and Inducers

Risk of Increased Oliceridine Plasma Concentrations

Increased plasma concentrations of oliceridine, which may result in prolonged opioid adverse reactions and exacerbated respiratory depression, may occur when OLINVYK is used under the following conditions:

In patients with decreased Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 function (poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 or normal metabolizers taking moderate or strong CYP2D6 inhibitors) [See Drug Interactions (7); Use in Specific Populations (8.8)].
In patients taking a moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor
In patients with decreased CYP2D6 function who are also receiving a moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitor
Discontinuation of a CYP3A4 inducer

These patients may require less frequent dosing of OLINVYK. Closely monitor these patients for respiratory depression and sedation at frequent intervals and base subsequent doses of OLINVYK on the patient's severity of pain and response to treatment [see Drug Interactions (7), Use in Specific Populations (8.8), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3, 12.5)].

Risk of Lower than Expected Oliceridine Plasma Concentrations

Lower than expected concentrations of oliceridine, which may lead to decreased efficacy, may occur under the following conditions:

Concomitant use of OLINVYK with CYP3A4 inducers
Discontinuation of a moderate or strong CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor

Closely monitor these patients at frequent intervals and consider supplemental doses of OLINVYK [see Dosage and Administration (2.2), Drug Interactions (7)].

### Investigating polygenic burden in age at disease onset in bipolar disorder: findings from an international multicentric study [^6bb426ce]. Bipolar Disorders (2019). Medium credibility.

5 SUMMARY

To our knowledge, this is the largest study thus far to investigate the association between AAO in BD and BD‐ and SCZ‐PRS. The results show, in our sample of 1995 BD patients, that the polygenic burden associated with BD or SCZ risk does not influence the age at illness onset in BD. These negative results highlight the need to conduct further larger scale studies, also including environmental information, to disentangle the genetic architecture of early‐onset BD.

### Morphology of travel routes and the organization of cities [^bf222a53]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Data sampling and definition of inness I. a Thirty-six origin–destination (OD) pairs (spaced out at intervals of 10°) are assigned along the circumference of circles at a distance of 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 km from the city center C. b For each OD pair, we query the Open Source Map API and collect the shortest routes (red) and the fastest routes (blue) (shown here for a representative OD pair in Paris). c A typical OD pair with the straight line connecting them representing the geodesic distance s; r is the radial distance from the center and θ is the angular separation relative to the center. We define the inness (I) to be the difference between the inner travel area (polygon delineated by red inner point and straight line) and the outer travel area (polygon delineated by blue outer point and straight line). d Three possible route configurations between multiple OD pairs. One with an exclusively outer travel area (blue), one with an exclusively inner travel area (red), and one where there is some combination of both

The inness of a node in the road network is a result of aggregating characteristics of all possible routes that pass through that point. Indeed, it reflects the structure of the network since it is a metric influenced by topology and network connectivity. However, in addition to this, it captures the geometric aspects of the network since it is a measure based on the curvature of the roads along a route and encodes structural information at both the global and local scales. In that sense, one can consider it to contain elements of various standard structural network metrics (see Supplementary Note 2 for details and comparison with a series of network metrics). We note that such metrics — particularly those that are global measures such as the betweenness centrality — have been previously used to classify cities. Recent results, however, cast doubt on the efficacy of centrality measures to distinguish between cities. On the other hand, as we will demonstrate, the inness, in addition to being a relatively simple measure, encodes the geometric, infrastructural, geographical, and socioeconomic aspects of urban systems.

### The LEADING guideline: reporting standards for expert panel, best-estimate diagnosis, and longitudinal expert all data (LEAD) methods [^08f9a5f2]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

2.2.1. Delphi survey results

The criteria for including a reporting standard was that the median of Delphi expert responses was at least 6 = Agree on the question about its inclusion. In Round 1, the mean ratings for the item inclusion scale ranged from 5.37 to 6.67 (M = 6.06; SD = 0.31; Table S2) with a median agreement ranging from 6 = Agree to 7 = Strongly Agree. No new standards were suggested. The feedback resulted in the removal of one reporting standard and the clarification and reformulation of 20 standards. The standard on Transparency and replicability was rated as relevant but removed because it is achieved by reporting the other reporting standards. Standard 4.2 Validity and Standard needed a major clarification about the meaning of validity as well as standard. Minor clarifications and reformations, such as grammar or word changes, were made for 19 standards (see open material). The mean ratings in Round 2 ranged from 5.47 to 6.70 (M = 6.20; SD = 0.37; Table S3), with open feedback resulting in minor clarifications and reformulations of nine standards.

2.3. Refining the guideline through expert consensus

The authors finalized the guidelines in an expert consensus meeting. The meeting was held online with nine working and steering group members. The content and structure of the consensus meeting were prepared by the working group, and the meeting was led by the last author (O.K.). Participants had access to the guidelines, inclusion rationales (i.e. elaboration and explanation), and the drafted paper before the meeting, where they also had the option to provide comments and feedback in writing. The meeting included reviewing the Delphi Rounds 1 and 2 findings and discussing the paper draft, including the individual reporting standards and groups. We decided not to carry out another Delphi round since i) the median agreement for each reporting standard in both Delphi Rounds 1 and 2 ranged from 6 = Agree to 7 = Strongly Agree, ii) no new standards were suggested, and iii) only minor changes were needed after Round 2, which taken together suggest consensus.

### Attitudes of psychiatrists towards people with mental illness: a cross-sectional, multicentre study of stigma in 32 European countries [^7b69ef4e]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Mental health-related stigma occurs among the public and professionals alike. The lived experience of mental illness has been linked to less stigmatising attitudes. However, data on psychiatrists and the relationship between stigmatising attitudes and psychotherapeutic activity or case discussion groups remains scarce.

Methods

A cross-sectional multicentre study was performed in 32 European countries to investigate the lived experiences and attitudes of psychiatrists toward patients with mental illness as well as the relationship between stigma, psychosocial and professional factors. The self-reported, anonymous, internet-based Opening Minds Stigma Scale for Health Care Providers was used to measure the stigmatising attitudes. The survey was translated into the local language of each participating country. All participants were practising specialists and trainees in general adult or child and adolescent psychiatry. The study took place between 2nd October, 2019 and 9th July, 2021 and was preregistered at.

Findings

A total of 4245 psychiatrists completed the survey. The majority, 2797 (66%), had completed training in psychiatry, and 3320 (78%) worked in adult psychiatry. The final regression model showed that across European countries more favourable attitudes toward people with mental illness were statistically significantly associated with the lived experience of participants (including seeking help for their own mental health conditions (d = −0.92, 95% confidence interval (CI) = −1.68 to −0.15, p = 0.019), receiving medical treatment for a mental illness (d = −0.88, 95% CI = −1.71 to −0.04, p = 0.040), as well as having a friend or a family member similarly affected (d = −0.68, 95% CI = −1.14 to −0.22, p = 0.004)), being surrounded by colleagues who are less stigmatising (d = −0.98, 95% CI = −1.26 to −0.70, p < 0.001), providing psychotherapy to patients (d = −1.14, 95% CI = −1.63 to −0.65 p < 0.001), and being open to (d = −1.69, 95% CI = −2.53 to −0.85, p < 0.001) and actively participating in (d = −0.94, 95% CI = −1.45 to −0.42, p < 0.001) case discussion, supervision, or Balint groups.

Interpretation

Our study highlights the importance of psychotherapy training, supervision, case discussions and Balint groups in reducing the stigmatising attitudes of psychiatrists toward patients. As the findings represent cross-national predictors, Europe-wide policy interventions, national psychiatric education systems and the management of psychiatric institutions should take these findings into consideration.

Diagnostic assessment, disease stratification, and treatment outcome

Table 2 summarizes the pros and cons of the various technologies that are instrumental not only for the identification and delineation of HD ALL cases, but also for the in-depth analyses of their genomic structure. Several of these technologies are quite sophisticated, so it is quite surprising that those being used almost exclusively for treatment stratification today are still the rather basic options that have been already in use for many decades. The reason for this is that these diagnostic tools are simple to perform, cheap, and fast. However, the fact that they are still considered sufficient also implies that, for clinical purposes, a more in-depth evaluation of the intricate features of such cases is deemed completely unnecessary, since these patients have in any case an overall very good outlook (Table 3). Yet, as alluded to above, this tactic does certainly neither suffice for the demarcation and clear assignment of classical and nonclassical HD cases nor for that of classical HD and near-triploid ones, respectively. Such delineation ambiguities can to a certain extent obscure the outcome results that are obtained by different treatment studies. Moreover, applying the usual DNA content of equal to or more than 1.16 (equivalent to approximately 54 chromosomes) as the lower defining HD threshold will fail to secure cases with karyotypes that contain only a smaller and/or lower number of chromosomes. As pointed out by Carroll et al. such allocation problems cause the misclassification of a considerable proportion (at least 25%) of nonclassical HD cases. They showed that studies that evaluated the treatment outcome of mono- and bi-clonal hyperhaploid cases never included monoclonal nonclassical HD cases, even though they are always equated with hyperhaploid ones and automatically assigned to the high-risk group, in case they are indeed identified. Carroll's observation can only mean that monoclonal nonclassical HD cases were either recognized but purposely not included or not recognized and consequently stratified and handled the same way as classical HD cases.

Air travel volume and health concerns — In 2019, 4.5 billion passengers took nearly 47 million international flights; the following year, global passenger air travel volume decreased by nearly two-thirds (1.8 billion passengers took 22 million flights), a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, and subsequently has reverted to pre-pandemic levels. Illness directly from air travel is not commonly reported, but main concerns include exacerbations of chronic medical conditions from changes in air pressure and humidity, relative immobility during flights leading to thromboembolic disease, and risk for infection due to proximity to others on board who could have communicable diseases.

We propose that there is, in fact, a single cell which serves as a stem cell for all tissues. The phenotype of this cell is determined by its cell cycle state and by the tissue in which it resides. Here we outline our data and reasoning for this model. Four major considerations are reviewed (Table 1): (1) alterations of cellular phenotype with cell cycle passage of the stem cell at baseline state, (2) differentiation potential of the stem cell at different points in cell cycle (3) microenvironmental influences and stem cell plasticity and (4) stem cell heterogeneity. All of these closely interrelated considerations point to the existence of a cycling universal stem cell for all tissues.

Medical management of motion sickness — clinical approach: In travelers with acute symptoms consistent with motion sickness, other causes should be excluded, including peripheral and central vestibular disease. Travelers with a history of migraine headaches may benefit from migraine headache treatments, either prophylactically or after symptom onset. Supportive measures include reassurance and having the patient lie down, and ensuring adequate fluid and electrolyte intake if vomiting. In acute motion sickness, non-oral routes of administration of anti-motion-sickness drugs may be necessary because absorption of oral medications may be impaired due to gastric stasis, even without vomiting; in severe acute motion sickness, intramuscular injection should be considered. Transdermal suppository routes are suboptimal due to slower absorption rates, and behavioral techniques may also be helpful.

Summary

HD leukemias have puzzled and confused researchers and clinicians for more than 50 years now. Novel findings that derive from array, mutation, and gene expression analyses offer now new opportunities to re-examine deeply engrained, yet largely unproven and unquestioned views about their origin, their mode of creation, and the interrelatedness of the diverse aneuploid sub-forms. Such fresh insights will eventually help to reconsider and refine the current classification system and thereby also influence the prognostic stratification and treatment of these subgroups. One example concerns the elucidation of the biological relatedness of classical, nonclassical ("duplicated hyperhaploids"), and pure hyperhaploid cases, which will help to better understand what drives their apparent different clinical behaviors. Another one concerns hyperdiploid forms with a high chromosome number. Near-triploid cases as well as mono- and bi-clonal hypodiploid cases can nowadays be easily ascertained, because over 90% of them are TP53 mutated. However, it is less clear whether the remaining TP53 wild-type ones with a similar high chromosome count should be also stratified as near-triploid or rather as classical hyperdiploid ones. Although this concerns only a few cases, their diagnostic clarification, and most appropriate allocation requires further scrutiny. Array analyses deliver not only a detailed information about copy number changes, but also about allele distribution alterations, such as the presence of otherwise unidentifiable uniparental disomies. Bearing the ongoing trend to reduce treatment for very low-risk patients in mind, which especially also concerns HD leukemias, we advocate to implement this state-of-the-art technology together with mutation screening in treatment studies to comprehensively characterize the detailed genomic make-up of HD leukemias. Only such an approach, rather than, as is current practice, merely typifying them with DNA content measurements, cytogenetics, and/or selected FISH probes, can better our understanding of the biology and the clinical behavior of the karyotypically heterogeneous subsets of classical and nonclassical HD leukemias as well as oversee in a more individual fashion the effects of various treatment interventions. The invaluable results that have already been obtained with such thorough analyses in selected yet still less well-characterized cohorts clearly prove, that the study-wide implementation of such a policy will significantly foster basic as well as clinical research in this particular group of patients and thereby provide benefits for their management that will go far beyond the simple identification and prognostic grading of HD cases, as is still done today.

### Anagrelide [^6d45a681]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Cardiovascular Toxicity

Torsades de pointes and ventricular tachycardia have been reported with anagrelide. Obtain a pre-treatment cardiovascular examination including an ECG in all patients. During treatment with anagrelide monitor patients for cardiovascular effects and evaluate as necessary.

Anagrelide increases the QTc interval of the electrocardiogram and increases the heart rate in healthy volunteers [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Do not use anagrelide in patients with known risk factors for QT interval prolongation, such as congenital long QT syndrome, a known history of acquired QTc prolongation, medicinal products that can prolong QTc interval and hypokalemia [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

Hepatic impairment increases anagrelide exposure and could increase the risk of QTc prolongation. Monitor patients with hepatic impairment for QTc prolongation and other cardiovascular adverse reactions. The potential risks and benefits of anagrelide therapy in a patient with mild and moderate hepatic impairment should be assessed before treatment is commenced. Reduce anagrelide dose in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Avoid use of anagrelide in patients with severe hepatic impairment.

In patients with heart failure, bradyarrhythmias, or electrolyte abnormalities, consider periodic monitoring with electrocardiograms [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.2)].

Anagrelide is a phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3) inhibitor and may cause vasodilation, tachycardia, palpitations, and congestive heart failure. Other drugs that inhibit PDE3 have caused decreased survival when compared with placebo in patients with Class III-IV congestive heart failure [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

In patients with cardiac disease, use anagrelide only when the benefits outweigh the risks.

5.2 Pulmonary Hypertension

Cases of pulmonary hypertension have been reported in patients treated with anagrelide. Evaluate patients for signs and symptoms of underlying cardiopulmonary disease prior to initiating and during anagrelide therapy [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

5.3 Bleeding Risk

Use of concomitant anagrelide and aspirin increased major hemorrhagic events in a postmarketing study. Assess the potential risks and benefits for concomitant use of anagrelide with aspirin, since bleeding risks may be increased. Monitor patients for bleeding, including those receiving concomitant therapy with other drugs known to cause bleeding (e.g., anticoagulants, PDE3 inhibitors, NSAIDs, antiplatelet agents, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) [see Drug Interactions (7.3), Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Conclusion

In conclusion, global PUD morbidity and mortality rates decreased significantly from 1990 to 2019; with the passage of time for Hp eradication, the downward trend gradually weakened, however, a high degree of heterogeneity among regions and countries. The gap in the burden of PUD is narrowing between poorer and richer countries, and the inequality is greatly reduced although the inequality still exists. The full implementation of control programs, infrastructure, prevention, and medical care is a key point opportunity for the eradication of PUD in the 204 countries and territories.

Adventure travel pre-travel planning and guided trip considerations — "During the pre-travel consultation, in addition to providing routine travel medicine advice, gather extra information and discuss precautions for adventure travel." For trip assessment, "Obtain details about the type, length, and remoteness of the trip." Even when joining guided trips, the text states to "encourage participants to ask trip organizers about: contingency plans for emergencies; guide experience and medical training; recommendations for medications and medical supplies to be carried by participants; types of medical kits (see Sec. 1, Ch. 9, Travel Health Kits) and safety equipment carried by guides; and types of recommended insurance (see Sec. 5, Ch. 1, Travel Insurance, Travel Health Insurance, and Medical Evacuation Insurance)." It further directs to "Confirm that the experience, fitness, and skill level of the participant matches the trip type," that "Novices at diving, mountaineering, sailing, or skiing should participate in instructional trips," and to "Encourage people with less experience or who are visiting a location for the first time to go on a guided trip."

Scenario 2: Moderate-to-severe features of COVID-19 — imaging is advised for patients with any pretest probability when there are no substantial critical resource constraints, and this applies regardless of the results or availability of COVID-19 testing; in COVID-19-positive patients imaging establishes baseline pulmonary status and, if clinical worsening occurs, imaging is again advised to assess for COVID-19 progression or secondary cardiopulmonary abnormalities such as pulmonary embolism, superimposed bacterial pneumonia, or heart failure; for COVID-19-negative or untested patients, imaging may reveal an alternative diagnosis, and because falsely negative testing is more prevalent in high pretest probability circumstances, repeat COVID-19 testing is therefore advised if available.

### Recommendations from the 2023 international evidence-based guideline for the assessment and management of polycystic ovary syndrome [^b74a4989]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2023). High credibility.

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) lifestyle and weight management — In those with higher weight, weight management can be associated with significant clinical improvements and key points need to be considered including a lifelong focus on prevention of further weight gain, a tailored energy deficit when weight loss is the goal, the value of improvement in central adiposity or metabolic health, and the need for ongoing assessment and support. Healthcare professionals should be aware of weight stigma when discussing lifestyle management with women with PCOS. Healthy lifestyle and optimal weight management, in the context of structured, intensive, and ongoing clinical support, appears equally effective in PCOS as in the general population. In those who are not overweight, in the adolescent and at key life points, the focus should be on healthy lifestyle and the prevention of excess weight gain. Although insulin resistance is a pathophysiological factor in PCOS, clinically available insulin assays are of limited clinical relevance and should not be used in routine care.

### Isatuximab (Sarclisa) [^a89d7ead]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

There are no available data on the presence of isatuximab-irfc in human milk, milk production, or the effects on the breastfed child. Maternal immunoglobulin G is known to be present in human milk. The effects of local gastrointestinal exposure and limited systemic exposure in the breastfed infant to SARCLISA are unknown. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the breastfed child from isatuximab-irfc administered in combination with pomalidomide or lenalidomide and dexamethasone, advise lactating women not to breastfeed during treatment with SARCLISA. Refer to pomalidomide or lenalidomide prescribing information for additional information.

8.3 Females and Males of Reproductive Potential

SARCLISA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)].

Pregnancy Testing

With the combination of SARCLISA with pomalidomide or lenalidomide, refer to the pomalidomide or lenalidomide labeling for pregnancy testing requirements prior to initiating treatment in females of reproductive potential.

Contraception

Females

Advise female patients of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment and for 5 months after the last dose of SARCLISA. Additionally, refer to the pomalidomide or lenalidomide labeling for contraception requirements prior to initiating treatment in females of reproductive potential.

Males

Refer to the pomalidomide or lenalidomide prescribing information.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and effectiveness of SARCLISA in pediatric patients have not been established.

The safety and efficacy of SARCLISA in combination with chemotherapy were assessed, but not established, in an open-label study (ACT15378, ISAKIDS, NCT03860844) in 62 pediatric patients aged 1.4 years to < 17 years with relapsed or refractory T-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). No new safety signals were observed in pediatric patients in this trial.

Body weight adjusted clearance at steady state and volume of distribution of isatuximab in pediatric patients were within the range of values that were observed in adults.
