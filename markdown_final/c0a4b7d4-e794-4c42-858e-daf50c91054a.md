## Question

Sharp chest pains after hiccup

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to evaluate sharp chest pain that began after a hiccup. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate safety and whether this could be life-threatening. Then, I should characterize the pain and its modifiers to estimate pretest probabilities. Next, I will construct a prioritized differential diagnosis and map it to an initial workup. After that, I need to consider special scenarios where hiccups themselves signal serious disease. Finally, I will outline management pathways, disposition, and patient education, ensuring I double-check where I might overcall or undercall diagnoses along the way.

> Let me first confirm the need for urgent evaluation, because I should not anchor on benign causes too early. Any new chest pain warrants expedited assessment, and pleuritic or sharp pain still requires exclusion of pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, pericarditis, and aortic syndromes before labeling it noncardiac, so activating EMS is appropriate if symptoms are ongoing or concerning [^113N8YSs] [^114qMUBR] [^113G3N6G].

> Wait, let me verify the pain characterization before jumping to tests. I need to ask about quality, location, radiation, onset, duration, aggravating and relieving factors, and associated symptoms, because sharp, pleuritic pain worsened by inspiration and supine position lowers the likelihood of myocardial ischemia and raises concern for pericarditis, whereas fleeting seconds-long pain is also less likely to be ischemic, and positional pain is usually nonischemic, though I should not overstate this because exceptions exist in older adults, women, and people with diabetes [^112diTyM] [^116xMAWL] [^115EMAzi].

> Hold on, I should verify the temporal relationship with the hiccup. A sudden sharp pain immediately following a forceful hiccup makes me consider diaphragmatic or intercostal muscle strain, pleural irritation, or even a microtrauma-related pneumothorax, so I need to check for focal chest wall tenderness, breath sounds, and any crepitus or subcutaneous emphysema while keeping pleural and pulmonary causes in mind [^113X6ZkZ] [^113G3N6G].

> I will now examine for red flags that mandate emergent imaging and specialty input. Sudden ripping pain radiating to the back suggests acute aortic syndrome, hemodynamic instability or muffled heart sounds raise concern for tamponade, unilateral absent breath sounds or subcutaneous emphysema point to pneumothorax, and syncope or presyncope with pleuritic pain should prompt evaluation for pulmonary embolism, so I should not delay chest radiography, ECG, and targeted advanced imaging when these are suspected [^114qMUBR] [^113G3N6G].

> Let me consider the most likely diagnosis first. Musculoskeletal or diaphragmatic irritation from forceful hiccup is common and typically produces localized sharp pain reproducible with palpation or specific movements, so I should perform a careful chest wall exam and attempt pain reproduction with maneuvers like the crowing rooster or crossed-chest adduction to support costochondritis or intercostal muscle strain while remembering that reproducibility argues against ischemia but not against other serious causes [^113j7KKi] [^111cjY6V].

> Next, I should review pericarditis as a leading cardiac mimic. Classic features include sharp, pleuritic, retrosternal pain improved by sitting forward and worse supine, sometimes with a friction rub, and ECG may show diffuse concave ST elevation with PR depression, so I need to check vitals, auscultate carefully after exhalation with the patient leaning forward, obtain ECG, and consider inflammatory markers and echocardiography if effusion is suspected, because missing pericarditis delays NSAID and colchicine therapy and risks complications [^114kFUzm] [^11422cdU] [^113kmwjn].

> But wait, what if the hiccup itself was the harbinger of a serious condition? I should double-check for case reports linking persistent hiccups to myocardial ischemia, tamponade, and COVID-19 pneumonia, especially in patients with risk factors or atypical presentations, so if hiccups preceded or accompany the pain, I need a lower threshold for ECG and troponin, echocardiography, and chest imaging to avoid anchoring bias [^1178vARY] [^111mUMxq] [^117NnaLi] [^115BAsiQ] [^112mjCk6].

> I need to ensure I do not overlook pneumothorax. A sudden sharp pain after a forceful hiccup could reflect increased intrathoracic pressure causing alveolar rupture, so I should obtain a chest radiograph urgently and consider CT if the film is nondiagnostic but suspicion remains, particularly in tall, thin individuals or those with recent thoracic procedures or trauma, and I should be ready for needle decompression if tension physiology is suspected [^113G3N6G].

> Let me think about pulmonary embolism briefly. Although pleuritic pain is classic, I should confirm risk factors and use a validated decision rule before ordering D-dimer or CTA, because anchoring on hiccup-related pain could lead me to miss PE in the right clinical context, so I should integrate Wells or PERC and pretest probability rather than dismissing PE solely due to pain mechanism [^113G3N6G].

> I should confirm the initial workup sequence. Obtain vital signs, focused history, and physical examination, then ECG, chest radiograph, and high-sensitivity troponin when cardiac ischemia is in the differential, adding CBC, inflammatory markers, and D-dimer selectively based on suspected etiologies, and escalate to echocardiography, CTA, or CMR as indicated by evolving suspicion for pericarditis, PE, aortic disease, or structural heart disease [^113N8YSs] [^111tS442] [^111NMhTM].

> Hold on, I should verify disposition thresholds. Anyone with abnormal vitals, concerning ECG or biomarkers, suspected effusion or tamponade, pneumothorax, or persistent severe pain needs emergency department evaluation and specialty consultation, whereas low-risk patients with reproducible chest wall pain, normal vitals, normal ECG and troponin, and reassuring chest radiograph can be discharged with clear return precautions and analgesia, ensuring close follow-up within 24 to 48 hours [^113N8YSs].

> For management, let me reconsider the likely musculoskeletal pain first. NSAIDs, acetaminophen, topical analgesics, and activity modification are reasonable, and I should teach simple breathing techniques to reduce recurrent hiccups that perpetuate pain, while warning that NSAIDs may worsen gastritis or interact with comorbidities, so I need to tailor therapy and monitor for adverse effects [^116yLNyX] [^116ffCW2].

> If pericarditis is diagnosed, I should initiate high-dose NSAIDs with gastric protection and colchicine, avoid corticosteroids initially when possible due to recurrence risk, and arrange cardiology follow-up, with echocardiography to assess for effusion and consideration of CMR if the diagnosis remains uncertain or to define myocarditis overlap, documenting symptom improvement with forward lean as supportive clinical evidence [^114kFUzm] [^11422cdU].

> If pneumothorax is confirmed, I should not delay procedural management. Needle decompression for tension followed by chest tube placement for persistent air leak is standard, and I should repeat imaging to confirm lung re-expansion and monitor for recurrence, coordinating with thoracic surgery if secondary pneumothorax or persistent air leak is present [^notfound].

> I should double-check that patient education includes clear return precautions for worsening pain, dyspnea, syncope, fever, or new palpitations, and reinforce that relief with nitroglycerin is not diagnostic of ischemia, so they should not interpret transient relief as reassuring in the absence of a completed evaluation, which could delay necessary care [^112diTyM] [^114qMUBR].

> Finally, let me verify that I have not overgeneralized. While sharp, pleuritic, positional pain is usually nonischemic, exceptions occur, particularly in older adults, women, and people with diabetes, so I must integrate risk factors, baseline ECG, and troponin results rather than relying on pain descriptors alone, and I should avoid labeling symptoms as atypical because that can be misleading in triage and communication [^115EMAzi] [^111o6SQd] [^115cvQpm].

Sharp chest pain after a hiccup is most often due to **muscle strain or costochondritis** from the sudden diaphragmatic contraction, but it can also signal **serious conditions** such as pneumothorax, pericarditis, or even myocardial ischemia in at-risk patients [^113G3N6G] [^1152j1Qz]. Immediate evaluation is warranted if pain is severe, persistent, or accompanied by dyspnea, fever, or hemodynamic instability. Initial workup should include a **focused history, exam, ECG, chest X-ray, and troponin** [^113G3N6G]; further testing (CT, echocardiography, D-dimer) is guided by clinical suspicion [^113G3N6G] [^11422cdU]. Most cases are benign and resolve with rest and analgesics, but persistent or complicated cases need targeted therapy and follow-up [^112gAm3Y] [^113G3N6G].

---

## Pathophysiological mechanisms

Several **mechanisms** can explain sharp chest pain following a hiccup:

- **Musculoskeletal strain**: Sudden diaphragmatic and intercostal muscle contraction can cause strain or spasm, leading to localized pain [^113X6ZkZ].

- **Costochondritis**: Hiccup-induced mechanical stress can inflame costosternal joints, causing sharp, reproducible pain [^113j7KKi].

- **Pneumothorax**: Forceful hiccups can rupture apical blebs, causing spontaneous pneumothorax, especially in tall, thin patients or those with underlying lung disease [^notfound].

- **Pericarditis**: Hiccups may irritate the pericardium, causing sharp, pleuritic pain relieved by sitting forward [^114kFUzm].

- **Myocardial ischemia**: Rarely, hiccups can trigger ischemia in patients with coronary artery disease, particularly diabetics or the elderly [^1178vARY].

---

## Clinical evaluation

A thorough **clinical evaluation** is essential to differentiate benign from serious causes:

- **History**: Characterize pain (sharp, pleuritic, positional), duration, associated symptoms (dyspnea, fever, palpitations), and risk factors (smoking, CAD, lung disease).

- **Physical examination**: Look for chest wall tenderness, reproducible pain, friction rub, breath sounds, and signs of respiratory distress [^113kmwjn].

- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**: Identify ischemia or pericarditis [^113kmwjn].

- **Chest X-ray**: Detect pneumothorax, pneumonia, or other pulmonary causes [^113G3N6G].

- **Troponin**: Evaluate for myocardial injury [^111MyB1K].

- **D-dimer**: Consider if pulmonary embolism is suspected [^113G3N6G].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **differential diagnosis** of sharp chest pain following a hiccup includes:

| **Category** | **Conditions** |
|-|-|
| Musculoskeletal | - Costochondritis <br/> - Muscle strain <br/> - Rib fracture [^113X6ZkZ] |
| Respiratory | - Pneumothorax <br/> - Pneumonia <br/> - Pleurisy <br/> - Pulmonary embolism [^113G3N6G] |
| Cardiac | - Pericarditis <br/> - Myocardial ischemia <br/> - Myocarditis [^113kmwjn] |
| Gastrointestinal | - Gastroesophageal reflux <br/> - Esophageal spasm <br/> - Hiatal hernia [^113X6ZkZ] |
| Other | - Anxiety <br/> - Herpes zoster [^116NRYoo] |

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Musculoskeletal pain**: NSAIDs, rest, and reassurance [^notfound].

- **Costochondritis**: NSAIDs, local corticosteroid injections if refractory [^notfound].

- **Pneumothorax**: Observation for small pneumothorax; chest tube insertion for larger or symptomatic cases [^notfound].

- **Pericarditis**: NSAIDs, colchicine, and corticosteroids if refractory [^114kFUzm].

- **Myocardial ischemia**: Standard ACS management, including antiplatelet therapy, nitrates, beta-blockers, and revascularization if indicated [^notfound].

---

## Prognosis and complications

Prognosis is **excellent for benign musculoskeletal causes**, with resolution in days to weeks. Serious conditions like pneumothorax, pericarditis, or myocardial ischemia carry greater risk and require targeted therapy and follow-up. Complications include chronic pain, respiratory compromise, and, rarely, cardiac events.

---

## Preventive measures

Preventive measures include **stress reduction** to reduce hiccup frequency, breathing exercises to strengthen respiratory muscles, and avoiding triggers such as carbonated beverages and large meals [^116ffCW2]. Persistent hiccups warrant evaluation for underlying pathology [^112UMJpV].

---

Sharp chest pain after a hiccup is **usually benign** (musculoskeletal or costochondritis) but can signal serious disease. A focused history, exam, ECG, chest X-ray, and troponin are the initial steps; further testing is guided by suspicion. Most cases resolve with conservative care, but persistent or complicated cases need targeted therapy and follow-up.

### Hiccups as the only symptom of non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction [^111mUMxq]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Hiccups, which are usually benign and self-limited, occasionally serve as markers of a serious underlying pathology. We present this case report to inform emergency physicians about the potential for hiccups to serve as the only presenting symptom of a myocardial infarction. The patient, a 68-year-old man with a history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and current tobacco use, was first seen in the emergency department after 4 days of intractable hiccups with no other complaints or symptoms. After ineffective hiccup treatment on the first visit with 2 mg Ativan and 25 intramuscular (i.m.) thorazine and a normal chest x-ray, he was discharged. Two days later, the patient returned to the emergency department with the same complaint of hiccups without any additional complaints or symptoms. An electrocardiogram displayed several abnormalities including Q waves in II, III, and aVF and T-wave inversions in aVL and V6. Troponin I was highly elevated at 4.302 ng/mL. In the catheterization laboratory, the patient exhibited severe stenosis of the left circumflex artery and obtuse marginal 1. Stents were placed in these sites, and the patient recovered uneventfully. This is the first case in which hiccups were the single presenting symptom of a myocardial infarction in the last 50 years. Although extremely common and usually benign, hiccups can occasionally be a sole symptom of serious underlying pathology, which in this case, was a non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Initial evaluation — history for chest pain emphasizes that in patients with chest pain, a focused history that includes characteristics and duration of symptoms relative to presentation as well as associated features, and cardiovascular risk factor assessment should be obtained. A comprehensive history that captures all the characteristics of chest pain, including but not limited to its 1) nature; 2) onset and duration; 3) location and radiation; 4) precipitating factors; 5) relieving factors; and 6) associated symptoms, can help better identify potential cardiac causes and should be obtained from all patients. The initial ECG is important to the evaluation, but history, examination, biomarkers, and other aids remain essential, and there is frequently a lack of correlation between intensity of symptoms and seriousness of disease.

Defining chest pain — recommendations and terminology — state that "An initial assessment of chest pain is recommended to triage patients effectively on the basis of the likelihood that symptoms may be attributable to myocardial ischemia" (Class of Recommendation [COR] 1, Level of Evidence [LOE] B-NR), and "Chest pain should not be described as atypical, because it is not helpful in determining the cause and can be misinterpreted as benign in nature. Instead, chest pain should be described as cardiac, possibly cardiac, or noncardiac because these terms are more specific to the potential underlying diagnosis" (COR 1, LOE C-LD).

SIDE EFFECTS OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

1. Vaginal bleeding

Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting may occur while you are taking the pills. Irregular bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding which is a flow much like a regular period. Irregular bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of oral contraceptive use, but may also occur after you have been taking the pill for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue taking your pills on schedule. If the bleeding occurs in more than one cycle or lasts for more than a few days, talk to your healthcare professional.

### Pneumothorax after acupuncture [^115g4oCp]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Acupuncture is a well-known form of complementary medicine that is increasingly being used worldwide. Despite being rare, pneumothorax is the most common serious complication described in acupuncture. A 79-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with a pneumothorax. Two days before, she had undergone an acupuncture treatment for chronic back pain. She felt a sharp right shoulder pain as needles were inserted in the interscapular area. As the pain did not resolve, she consulted her general practitioner and had a chest radiography done, revealing a right-sided pneumothorax. At the hospital, a right chest tube was inserted with relief of the symptoms and lung expansion. The chest tube was removed on the second day of admission, and she was discharged on the third day. Both acupuncturists and clinicians need to be aware of the possibility of adverse events following acupuncture, especially in those who develop symptoms.

Cardiac injuries due to penetration by sharp foreign bodies usually have a clear clinical presentation. A case of a 38-year-old man with self-inserted cardiac lesions and a misleading presentation is reported. The patient was admitted to the emergency room because of chest pain, with increase in biomarkers of myocardial necrosis, and electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities inducing initial diagnostic and therapeutic workup of acute coronary syndrome. Once clinical destabilization followed by death had occurred, the suspicion of an alternative diagnosis came from delayed chest radiography, confirmed by autopsy, revealing the presence of multiple metallic objects within the thorax.

### Persistent hiccup associated with thoracic epidural injection [^1171R7QE]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2001). Low credibility.

Epidural steroid injections are commonly used to treat lumbosacral radicular and discogenic pain. When used in this manner, these agents can cause minor, transient systemic side effects and rarely result in any serious complications. Because adverse reactions are uncommon and transient, epidural injections are considered a safe therapeutic intervention. We describe the first case of persistent hiccups as a consequence of a thoracic epidural steroid injection in a patient with thoracic discogenic pain.

### Case report: two cases of persistent hiccups complicating COVID-19 [^116SGKBG]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Hiccups are familiar to everyone; they are repetitive contractions of the diaphragm and the intercostal muscles. The classification of hiccups is based on their duration. An acute attack lasts less than 48 hours. Persistent hiccups last more than 2 days. Intractable hiccups are present if the attack lasts more than 1 month. Hiccups are more common in diseases affecting the gastrointestinal or central nervous systems. Among the causes of hiccups, toxic and pharmacological drug use, and recent surgical operations are included. Ear–nose–throat (ENT), cardiovascular, and pulmonary disorders affecting the peripheral nervous system are also among the causes of hiccups. Hiccups are rarely described as a clinical manifestation of community-acquired pneumonia, and one should consider this diagnosis in a patient with unexplained fever. Rarely, pneumonia manifests as intractable hiccups, with the latter resolving with antibiotic treatment. Whenever possible, the treatment of hiccups should be directed at the underlying cause of the condition. Several pharmacological agents (metoclopramide, baclofen, gabapentin, and chlorpromazine) are reported for empirical treatment of persistent hiccups. Two large case series from 1950s documented the efficacy of chlorpromazine for cessation of persistent hiccups.

Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) was designated by the WHO in February 2020, and the pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes SARS has spread throughout the world. The most frequently reported symptoms are fever, dry cough, muscle pain, fatigue, and complicated dyspnea, with less commonly reported symptoms of headache, diarrhea, hemoptysis, rhinorrhea, and cough with phlegm. The first case of a COVID-19 infection presenting with persistent hiccups was reported by Prince et al. Bakheet et al.reported that hiccup attacks could be more severe and prolonged.

We describe two male patients who presented with COVID-19-related hiccups: one during his initial presentation and one 10 days after the diagnosis of COVID-19 was made.

### High-risk chief complaints I: chest pain-the big three (an update) [^112PoAtR]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Nontraumatic chest pain is a frequent concern of emergency department patients, with causes that range from benign to immediately life threatening. Identifying those patients who require immediate/urgent intervention remains challenging and is a high-risk area for emergency medicine physicians where incorrect or delayed diagnosis may lead to significant morbidity and mortality. This article focuses on the 3 most prevalent diagnoses associated with adverse outcomes in patients presenting with nontraumatic chest pain, acute coronary syndrome, thoracic aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism. Important aspects of clinical evaluation, diagnostic testing, treatment, and disposition and other less common causes of lethal chest pain are also discussed.

### Case report: two cases of persistent hiccups complicating COVID-19 [^112mjCk6]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Pneumonia may rarely present with persistent hiccups, and hiccups may disappear after antibiotic treatment. A review of the literature reveals very few reported cases of pneumonia presenting with hiccups. Burdette and Marinellasuggested that inflammatory pneumonic irritation of the phrenic nerve and its pericardial branch, which are located along the superior portion of the diaphragm and right heart border, respectively, may be the pathophysiological cause of hiccups.

The first case of COVID-19 pneumonia presenting with persistent hiccups was reported by Prince et al. A 62-year-old woman presented with a 4-day history of hiccups. Ground-glass and consolidative pulmonary opacities compatible with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia were noted on chest X-ray and CT scan. Bakheet et al.reported a patient in whom hiccup attacks were more severe and prolonged (from 1 week before admission to 1 week afterward). He showed improvement after a baclofen dosage increase toward the end of his first week after admission, and he later proved to be COVID-19 negative. A small number of other case reports with atypical presentation of COVID-19 pneumonia with hiccups have been published.

One of our patients presented to the neurology department for hiccups, similar to other reports in the literature. Radiology and PCR confirmed a COVID-19 diagnosis. His persistent hiccups responded well to chlorpromazine and regressed within hours. After 2 months, his COVID-19 infection had resolved and there was no recurrence of hiccups. Our second patient is the first reported in the literature (to our knowledge) with a 15-day history of hospital treatment for COVID — without hiccups — who presented 2 days after discharge with persistent hiccups. Clinicians should be aware of the atypical characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially in patients in epidemic areas.

### Adjacent segment degeneration at T1-T2 presenting as chest pain: case report [^115x8GMS]. Spine (2005). Low credibility.

Study Design

A case report of a T1-T2 herniated disc adjacent to a cervical spine fusion.

Objective

To describe the clinical presentation and treatment of a symptomatic T1-T2 disc herniation adjacent to an anterior cervical spine arthrodesis.

Summary Of Background Data

Symptomatic adjacent segment disease after cervical spine arthrodesis occurs most commonly in the lower cervical spine motion segments and has not been previously reported at T1-T2.

Methods

A 51-year-old female patient presented 4 years after three-level anterior cervical discectomy and fusion involving the C5-T1 levels. She complained of chronic chest pain and had undergone extensive medical evaluation before presentation. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a left-sided T1-T2 herniated disc compressing the T1 nerve root. She underwent T1-T2 anterior discectomy and fusion.

Results

The patient's symptoms resolved completely.

Conclusion

Adjacent-segment degeneration after cervical spine fusion may rarely occur even at T1-T2, and the unusual symptoms of a T1 radiculopathy may obscure the diagnosis. The combination of sharp anterior paramedian chest pain and numbness or weakness of the hand should prompt consideration of the diagnosis when cardiac ischemia or other more serious conditions have been ruled out.

### A 34-year-old woman with recurrent right-sided chest pain and dyspnea [^111RHB49]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

A 34-year-old woman presented with her third episode of acute-onset right-sided chest pain and dyspnea. She had two prior similar occurrences of right-sided sharp, pleuritic chest pain with radiation to the back and dyspnea. Chest radiographs during these presentations revealed a small apical right-sided pneumothorax that was managed conservatively with high-flow oxygen. All three presentations were associated with vigorous exercise and the first day of her menses. She denied cough, hemoptysis, fever, smoking history, airplane travel, scuba diving, or trauma during these presentations. The patient has been trying to conceive for the past year but has been unsuccessful because of uterine fibroids but no history of endometriosis.

### Intractable hiccups as a rare gastrointestinal manifestation in severe endocrine and metabolic crisis: case report and review of the literature [^114XMYLd]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and literature review

The incidence of endocrine emergencies is quite low but not negligible because once it occurs, the mortality is very high. DKA is a severe metabolic crisis induced by absolute or relative insufficiency of insulin activity, which is mainly associated with type 1 diabetes. However, DKA is increasingly recognized in patients with type 2 diabetes in recent years. The incidence of hospital admission for DKA increased from 0.70 to 0.98 per 1000 person-years in adults with T2DM. One in five cases of DKA is reported to have a history of type 2 diabetes, which leads to higher mortality, with infection, myocardial infarction and stroke as triggering factors in these patients. It is noted that some DKA cases caused by type 2 diabetes may not have an obvious precipitating cause. –

Hiccups are usually benign and self-limiting. Intractable hiccups is hiccups lasting more than 48 h. Intractable hiccups may produce significant discomfort and may also represent the clinical manifestation of life-threatening clinical conditions such as lateral medullary lesions, myocardial infarction, respiratory failure and pulmonary embolism. Hiccups are caused by stimulation of the diaphragm, phrenic nerve, vagus nerve, or central nervous system, causing paroxysmal spasm of one or both the diaphragm and intercostal muscle or anterior scalene muscle. Hiccups refers to a short, loud sound accompanied by a sudden closing of the glottis during inhalation. Intractable hiccups can cause severe anxiety, depression, reduced physical strength, respiratory failure and even death without timely treatment. Previous studies have revealed that cerebrovascular disorders, intracranial infectious diseases, severe pneumonia, uraemia, gastrointestinal problems, toxic or metabolic disorders and DKA all can cause intractable hiccups.

### Clinical pathologic conference: a 65-year-old male with left-sided chest pain. A case of an unexpected occupational hazard [^113AL9pr]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

The authors present a case of a 65-year-old male who presented four times to the emergency department (ED) with left-sided chest pain. On the first three visits, the patient was admitted with a different diagnosis related to his chest pain. On the final visit, an abnormality on an imaging study performed in the ED led to the ultimate diagnostic test revealing the cause of the patient's symptoms. The patient's clinical presentation and ultimate clinical course are summarized, and a discussion of the differential diagnoses of his condition is presented.

WARNING SIGNALS

If any of these adverse effects occur while you are taking oral contraceptives, call your doctor or healthcare provider immediately:

Sharp chest pain, coughing of blood, or sudden shortness of breath (indicating a possible clot in the lung)
Pain in the calf (indicating a possible clot in the leg)
Crushing chest pain or heaviness in the chest (indicating a possible heart attack)
Sudden severe headache or vomiting, dizziness or fainting, disturbances of vision or speech, weakness, or numbness in an arm or leg (indicating a possible stroke)
Sudden partial or complete loss of vision (indicating a possible clot in the eye)
Breast lumps (indicating possible breast cancer or fibrocystic disease of the breast; ask your doctor or healthcare provider to show you how to examine your breasts)
Severe pain or tenderness in the stomach area (indicating a possibly ruptured liver tumor)
Difficulty in sleeping, weakness, lack of energy, fatigue, or change in mood (possibly indicating severe depression)
Jaundice or a yellowing of the skin or eyeballs, accompanied frequently by fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, dark colored urine, or light colored bowel movements (indicating possible liver problems).

SIDE EFFECTS OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES 1. Vaginal bleeding

Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting may occur while you are taking the pills. Irregular bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding which is a flow much like a regular period. Irregular bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of oral contraceptive use, but may also occur after you have been taking the pill for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue taking your pills on schedule. If the bleeding occurs in more than one cycle or lasts for more than a few days, talk to your doctor or healthcare provider.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain guideline — purpose and epidemiology emphasize scope and burden. The charge of the writing committee was "to develop a guideline for the evaluation of acute or stable chest pain or other anatomic equivalents, in a variety of clinical settings, with an emphasis on the diagnosis of ischemic causes", and the guideline "will not provide recommendations on whether revascularization is appropriate, or what modality is indicated". After injuries, chest pain is "the second most common reason for adults to present to the emergency department (ED) in the United States and accounts for > 6.5 million visits, which is 4.7% of all ED visits", and "also leads to nearly 4 million outpatient visits annually in the United States". Although the cause is often noncardiac, coronary artery disease "affects > 18.2 million adults in the United States" and remains the leading cause of death, "accounting for > 365,000 deaths annually". The lifetime prevalence of chest pain in the United States is "20% to 40%, and women experience this symptom more often than men".

We report the case of a 52-year-old patient who sought a rheumatologic consultation for anterior chest pain of 2 weeks' duration. Radiology for trauma did not reveal any pathology. The laboratory findings focusing on rheumatologic diseases remained unhelpful and no abnormalities were found. After a cutaneous linear cordlike lesion at the right lateral chest wall occurred, the diagnosis of Mondor's disease could be made on the basis of clinical and histologic investigation. Because pain precedes the typical clinical manifestation, problems of diagnosis can occur in the early phase of the illness.

Top 10 take-home messages for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain state that pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw, as well as shortness of breath and fatigue should all be considered anginal equivalents. High-sensitivity cardiac troponins are the preferred standard for establishing a biomarker diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, allowing for more accurate detection and exclusion of myocardial injury. Patients with acute chest pain or chest pain equivalent symptoms should seek medical care immediately by calling 9–1–1, and although most patients will not have a cardiac cause, the evaluation of all patients should focus on the early identification or exclusion of life-threatening causes.

### Intradermal injection for hiccup therapy in the emergency department [^1126K32Z]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Hiccup is a condition caused by involuntary contraction of inspiratory muscles, especially the diaphragm. Although it is generally considered as a physiological. response, if hiccup persists for a long time, it can lead to many undesirable conditions such as depression, weight loss, insomnia, and fatigue. A 35-year-old male patient was admitted to our emergency department with hiccup lasting for 15 h. He had a history of several hiccup attacks. Classical non-pharmacological and pharmacological therapies were used to treat the condition without any response. As an alternative method, an intradermal injection was applied. A mixture of thiocolchicoside and lidocaine was administered intradermally to a depth of 1–3 mm at the epigastric region and adjacent to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The patient's hiccup ended after the intradermal injection procedure. During 48 h of follow-up the hiccup attack did not develop again. No complications related to the process were detected. This is the first case in the literature demonstrating the use of intradermal injection to terminate hiccups. The intradermal injection approach can be administered in cases of hiccups that do not respond to medical treatment.

Acute chest pain may represent the initial and/or accompanying symptom in a variety of disease processes that may occur in the cardiovascular system, respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract, or musculoskeletal system. Although clinical history, risk factors, and physical examination are important factors in establishing the etiology of symptoms in patients presenting with acute chest pain, imaging modalities are frequently utilized. Noncardiac causes of acute chest pain are reviewed in this paper with special reference to the most recently published literature and emphasis on acute aortic diseases. Imaging modalities with indication of appropriateness, optimal technique and practical keys for interpretation are discussed.

### Injection of bupivacaine into the pleural and mediastinal drains: a novel approach for decreasing incident pain after cardiac surgery-Montreal heart institute experience [^114AdpgS]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The intensity of pain immediately after cardiac surgery varies significantly between patients. While for some the experience is not painful for others it is impossible to achieve a reasonable level of comfort. This is important as studies have shown that high levels of acute post-operative pain are correlated with a high prevalence of chronic post-operative pain.

For many patients, one of the main sources of post-operative cardiac pain is the presence of pleural and mediastinal drains inserted by the surgeon at the end of surgery and maintained for 2 −3 days. This pain is often described as sharp, piercing, radiating to the back or shoulder, and occurring upon breathing, movement, or coughing. It generally remains unrelieved despite the administration of medications.

Intrapleural and chest tube-delivered bupivacaine, both infusion and bolus dosing, were first described by Reiestad et alin 1986 and have been used in many circumstances since. It has been used after various procedures such as post-thoracoscopy, post-thoracotomy, after hepatic resection, for upper abdominal surgery, and as analgesia during chest drainage treatment for pneumothorax. In most of these procedures, the catheters are placed under sterile conditions and left in place for several days allowing for repeated use. Occasionally, bolus doses are injected through the pleural infusion channel of a specially designed silicone chest tube. The literature has shown that, overall, this technique is successful in decreasing pain, and has a low rate of complications such as pneumothorax, hemothorax, empyema, systemic analgesic toxicity, infection or Horner's syndrome, although there is one case report of ventricular standstill with intrapleural bupivacaine. Despite the variety of uses of bupivacaine that have been described no publication has discussed the injection of bupivacaine directly into a regular drainage chest tube, in the setting of cardiac surgery, for the treatment of pain caused by the chest tube. There is one report on the use of bilateral intrapleural lidocaine and fentanyl after cardiac surgery.

Faced with uncontrollable/unrelieved pain in some patients, despite the application of a full multimodal analgesia protocol, the acute pain service team embarked on an unexplored avenue to pain management. We hypothesized that the instillation of local anesthetic into pleural and mediastinal drains would simultaneously decrease pain and opioid requirements. We report here on the technique, its safety, and efficacy.

### American Society of Echocardiography clinical recommendations for multimodality cardiovascular imaging of patients with pericardial disease: endorsed by the Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance and Society of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography [^11422cdU]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2013). Medium credibility.

Acute pericarditis — introduction and diagnostic criteria: Acute pericarditis is a pericardial syndrome characterized by infiltration of inflammatory cells into the pericardium; there are a multitude of causes and, in general, most cases are self-limited, with most cases idiopathic or viral, and it usually lasts < 3 months before being termed chronic pericarditis. Acute pericarditis typically presents with chest pain that is substernal and sharp, often acute in onset, and often radiating to the trapezius ridge; pericarditic pain is pleuritic, worse when lying down, and better when sitting forward, and the positional nature distinguishes it from myocardial ischemia. Physical signs include a pericardial friction rub and characteristic ECG changes; the diagnosis is based on the presence of (1) typical chest pain, (2) a pericardial rub, (3) typical ECG changes, and (4) new or worsening PEff, and in most cases, two or more of these findings are present. If not, ancillary supportive data should be sought, including elevations in inflammatory markers (Westergren sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein) or ultrasensitive C-reactive protein, white blood count or troponin levels or a fever, and in selective equivocal or refractory cases, imaging by CMR with T2-weighted (T2W) images and LGE may be used to identify pericardial edema and inflammation.

Pleurisy

Pleurisy was considered to be similar to pneumonia, except that it affected only one side. The pathophysiology was also related to the humoural doctrine. The disease was described as bilious or sanguineous, if the sputum contained bile or blood respectively, or as dry pleurisy in case of dehydration of the lung.

The clinical findings of pleurisy included chest pain, productive cough, tachypnoea, orthopnoea, fever and shivering. Pleuritic pain could extend from the shoulder and clavicle to the suprapubic area. "Pleurisy in the back" was an alarming condition, as the patient would suffer in agony, become tachypnoeic with immediate but little expectoration and pass blood-stained urine. In cases of pleurisy the physician was instructed to assess "if the patient is different in other ways from what is normal".

The therapeutic strategies for pleurisy were almost the same as for pneumonia. Additional treatment was more case-specific, taking into account the type of pleurisy –bilious, sanguineous, dry– and the individual patient –severity of disease, expectoration.

The key to prognosis was expectoration, with " crisis" expected within seven to fourteen days. Removal of purulent sputum was considered to be associated with recovery, since if expectoration failed, thoracic empyema was anticipated. Pneumonia was another possible complication. There were also other prognostic signs. " If the tongue becomes rough at the beginning, recovery from the disease is difficult". However, "if this sign appears when the disease is already advanced… the patient inevitably expectorates blood". If hiccups and haemoptysis were present, the patient could " succumb on the seventh day", but if the patient survived, an empyema formed. The treatise Diseases I describes the death from pleurisy as agonising: "The patient can succeed neither in coughing them up nor in bringing them to maturity, but his bronchial tubes are filled by the phlegm and pus in them. Then, the patient's breathing becomes stertorous, and he exhales rapidly and only from the upper part of his chest; In the end, he becomes completely blocked up, and dies".

### Acute pericarditis: diagnosis and management [^116xUWRS]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Acute pericarditis, inflammation of the pericardium, is found in approximately 5% of patients admitted to the emergency department for chest pain unrelated to acute myocardial infarction. It occurs most often in men 20 to 50 years of age. Acute pericarditis has a number of potential etiologies including infection, acute myocardial infarction, medication use, trauma to the thoracic cavity, and systemic diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis. However, most etiologic evaluations are inconclusive. Patients with acute pericarditis commonly present with acute, sharp, retrosternal chest pain that is relieved by sitting or leaning forward. A pericardial friction rub is found in up to 85% of patients. Classic electrocardiographic changes include widespread concave upward ST-segment elevation without reciprocal T-wave inversions or Q waves. First-line treatment includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colchicine. Glucocorticoids are traditionally reserved for severe or refractory cases, or in cases when the cause of pericarditis is likely connective tissue disease, autoreactivity, or uremia. Cardiology consultation is recommended for patients with severe disease, those with pericarditis refractory to empiric treatment, and those with unclear etiologies.

### Nontraumatic thoracic emergencies [^115mJgyB]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Acute chest pain is one of the most common complaints of patients who present to an emergency department, and accounts for up to 5% of all visits. It also is one of the most complex issues in an emergency setting because, although clinical signs and symptoms often are nonspecific, rapid diagnosis and therapy are of great importance. The chest radiograph remains an important component of the evaluation of chest pain, and usually is the first examination to be obtained. Nevertheless, cross-sectional imaging has added greatly to the ability to characterize the wide constellation of clinical findings into a distinct etiology. This article reviews how the various entities that can present as nontraumatic chest pain can manifest radiographically.

### Diagnosing the cause of chest pain [^117TdBEW]. American Family Physician (2005). Low credibility.

Chest pain presents a diagnostic challenge in outpatient family medicine. Noncardiac causes are common, but it is important not to overlook serious conditions such as an acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, or pneumonia. In addition to a thorough history and physical examination, most patients should have a chest radiograph and an electrocardiogram. Patients with chest pain that is predictably exertional, with electrocardiogram abnormalities, or with cardiac risk factors should be evaluated further with measurement of troponin levels and cardiac stress testing. Risk of pulmonary embolism can be determined with a simple prediction rule, and a D-dimer assay can help determine whether further evaluation with helical computed tomography or venous ultrasound is needed. Fever, egophony, and dullness to percussion suggest pneumonia, which can be confirmed with chest radiograph. Although some patients with chest pain have heart failure, this is unlikely in the absence of dyspnea; a brain natriuretic peptide level measurement can clarify the diagnosis. Pain reproducible by palpation is more likely to be musculoskeletal than ischemic. Chest pain also may be associated with panic disorder, for which patients can be screened with a two-item questionnaire. Clinical prediction rules can help clarify many of these diagnoses.

### Imaging of non-cardiac, non-traumatic causes of acute chest pain [^112gAm3Y]. European Journal of Radiology (2012). Low credibility.

Non-traumatic chest pain is a common symptom in patients who present in the emergency department. From a clinical point of view, it is important to differentiate cardiac chest pain from non-cardiac chest pain (NCCP). Among the plethora of potential causes of NCCP, life-threatening diseases, such as aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, tension pneumothorax, and esophageal rupture, must be differentiated from non-life threatening causes. The majority of NCCP, however, is reported to be benign in nature. The presentation of pain plays an important role in narrowing the differential diagnosis and initiating further diagnostic management and treatment. As the benign causes tend to recur, and may lead to patient anxiety and great costs, a meticulous evaluation of the patient is necessary to diagnose the underlying disorder or disease.

### An adult with episodic retrosternal chest pain: an unusual presentation of congenital pulmonary airway malformation-case report [^116MKj71]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

CPAM share similar embryologic and clinical characteristics with PS, CLE, and bronchogenic cyst (BC), the four major congenital cystic lesions that are an important cause of morbidity in neonates, infants, and children and presenting symptoms are primarily respiratory related. In neonates and infants these congenital lesions cause respiratory distress whilst in children and young adults the presenting symptoms are primarily respiratory distress, recurrent attacks of respiratory embarrassment, pulmonary infection, which may be associated with haemoptysis, or rarely haemothorax. Our case report is unique where a young adult presented with symptoms of sharp, episodic, retrosternal chest pains that were brought on with exercise. This mode of presentation has not been previously described. The mechanisms that could account for the pain are unclear and can only be speculated as a result of compression of the functioning lung with displacement of the mediastinum to the opposite side during exercise (Fig. 1 a), limited exercise tolerance due to less functional lung or pleuritic-type pain due to the CPAM segment. A chest radiograph is helpful in investigating the cause of this unusual mode of presentation. When suspected a contrast-enhanced CT scan is the gold standard for establishing the diagnosis and provides information about vascular anomalies such as concomitant cardiovascular, renal, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal and other malformations.

### Diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment of pericarditis: a review [^114kFUzm]. JAMA (2024). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Pericarditis accounts for up to 5% of emergency department visits for nonischemic chest pain in North America and Western Europe. With appropriate treatment, 70% to 85% of these patients have a benign course. In acute pericarditis, the development of constrictive pericarditis (< 0.5%) and pericardial tamponade (< 3%) can be life-threatening.

Observations

Acute pericarditis is diagnosed with presence of 2 or more of the following: sharp, pleuritic chest pain that worsens when supine (≈90%); new widespread electrocardiographic ST-segment elevation and PR depression (≈25%-50%); a new or increased pericardial effusion that is most often small (≈60%); or a pericardial friction rub (< 30%). In North America and Western Europe, the most common causes of acute pericarditis are idiopathic or viral, followed by pericarditis after cardiac procedures or operations. Tuberculosis is the most common cause in endemic areas and is treated with antituberculosis therapy, with corticosteroids considered for associated constrictive pericarditis. Treatment of acute idiopathic and pericarditis after cardiac procedures or operations involves use of high-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), with doses tapered once chest pain has resolved and C-reactive protein level has normalized, typically over several weeks. These patients should receive a 3-month course of colchicine to relieve symptoms and reduce the risk of recurrence (37.5% vs 16.7%; absolute risk reduction, 20.8%). With a first recurrence of pericarditis, colchicine should be continued for at least 6 months. Corticosteroids are often used if pericarditis does not improve with NSAIDs and colchicine. In certain patients with multiple recurrences, which can occur for several years, interleukin 1 (IL-1) blockers have demonstrated efficacy and may be preferred to corticosteroids.

Conclusions

Acute pericarditis is a common cause of nonischemic chest pain. Tuberculosis is the leading cause of pericarditis in endemic areas and is treated with antitubercular therapy. In North America and Western Europe, pericarditis is typically idiopathic, develops after a viral infection, or develops following cardiac procedures or surgery. Treatment with NSAIDs and colchicine leads to a favorable prognosis in most patients, although 15% to 30% of patients develop recurrence. Patients with multiple recurrent pericarditis can have a disease duration of several years or more, are often treated with corticosteroids, and IL-1 blockers may be used for selected patients as steroid-sparing therapy.

### Hiccups as the only symptom of acute myocardial infarction [^1178vARY]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Hiccups are usually benign, while myocardial infarction (MI) has the potential for morbidity and mortality. Here, we report 3 cases of MI, with hiccups being the only symptom on presentation to the emergency department. Attention should be given to patients who present with hiccups and multiple risk factors for acute coronary syndrome, especially those with factors predisposing them to atypical presentations, such as diabetes mellitus, and old age.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes: Anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort including pain, discomfort, heaviness, tightness, pressure, constriction, or squeezing, whereas sharp pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease and usually occurs with acute pericarditis. Anginal symptoms gradually build in intensity over a few minutes, while sudden onset of ripping chest pain with radiation to the upper or lower back is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Pain that can be localized to a very limited area and pain radiating to below the umbilicus or hip are unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS, and relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common associated symptoms include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, or heartburn unrelated to meals and nausea or vomiting, and symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing or sharp pain, or throat/abdominal discomfort may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

Pericarditis and myocarditis — clinical presentation and electrocardiographic features: Pericarditis and myocarditis share overlapping common causes and likely form a continuum, and most pericarditis in developed nations is viral although tuberculosis is sometimes a consideration. Pericarditis classically causes sharp, pleuritic chest pain that may improve by sitting up or leaning forward, a pericardial friction rub may be audible, and widespread ST-elevation with PR depression is the electrocardiographic hallmark though changes may be nonspecific and transient. Clinical manifestations of myocarditis are varied, often including sharp chest pain reflective of epicardial inflammation; myocardial dysfunction often causes fatigue and exercise intolerance, and predominance of heart failure distinguishes myocarditis from pericarditis; troponin is usually elevated, while in pericarditis a minimally elevated troponin does not appear to confer a worse prognosis.

Chest pain symptom characterization and terminology — For myocardial ischemia, the sensation is described as "characteristically deep, difficult to localize, and usually diffuse", and "Point tenderness renders ischemia less likely". "It is essential to ascertain the characteristics of the chest pain directly from the patient for optimal interpretation.17" Although "A patient's history is the most important basis for considering presence or absence of myocardial ischemia", "The diagnosis of ischemia may require data beyond history alone", and "In some patients, what appears to be noncardiac chest pain may be ischemic in origin". Features more consistent with ischemia are summarized as "Chest pain that is more likely associated with ischemia consists of substernal chest discomfort provoked by exertion or emotional stress and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin". Terminology guidance states "Atypical chest pain is a problematic term" and "we discourage the use of atypical chest pain"; to reduce ambiguity, "To diminish ambiguity, use "cardiac", "possible cardiac", and "noncardiac" to describe the suspected cause of chest pain is encouraged", and "chest pain is broadly defined to also include referred pain in the shoulders, arms, jaw, neck, and upper abdomen".

### Bedside diagnosis of coronary artery disease: a systematic review [^111cjY6V]. The American Journal of Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Purpose

To assess the accuracy of bedside findings for diagnosing coronary artery disease and acute myocardial infarction.

Methods

A MEDLINE search was performed to retrieve articles published from January 1966 to January 2003 that were relevant to the bedside diagnosis of coronary disease in adults.

Results

In patients with stable, intermittent chest pain, the most useful bedside predictors for a diagnosis of coronary disease were found to be the presence of typical angina (likelihood ratio [LR] = 5.8; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.2 to 7.8), serum cholesterol level > 300 mg/dL (LR = 4.0; 95% CI: 2.5 to 6.3), history of prior myocardial infarction (LR = 3.8; 95% CI: 2.1 to 6.8), and age > 70 years (LR = 2.6; 95% CI: 1.8 to 4.0). Nonanginal chest pain (LR = 0.1; 95% CI: 0.1 to 0.2), pain duration > 30 minutes (LR = 0.1; 95% CI: 0.0 to 0.9), and intermittent dysphagia (LR = 0.2; 95% CI: 0.1 to 0.8) argued against a diagnosis of coronary disease. In patients with acute chest pain, the most important bedside predictors for a diagnosis of myocardial infarction were new ST elevation (LR = 22; 95% CI: 16 to 30), new Q waves (LR = 22; 95% CI: 7.6 to 62), and new ST depression (LR = 4.5; 95% CI: 3.6 to 5.6). A normal electrocardiogram (LR = 0.2; 95% CI: 0.1 to 0.3), chest wall tenderness (LR = 0.3; 95% CI: 0.2 to 0.4), and pain that was pleuritic (LR = 0.2; 95% CI: 0.2 to 0.3), sharp (LR = 0.3; 95% CI: 0.2 to 0.5), or positional (LR = 0.3; 95% CI: 0.2 to 0.5) argued against the diagnosis of myocardial infarction.

Conclusion

The accuracy of bedside predictors depends on the clinical setting. In the evaluation of stable, intermittent chest pain, a patient's description of pain was found to be the most important predictor of underlying coronary disease. In the evaluation of acute chest pain, the electrocardiogram was the most useful bedside predictor for a diagnosis of myocardial infarction. Aside from the extremes in cholesterol values, the analysis of traditional risk factors changed the probability of coronary disease or myocardial infarction very little or not at all.

Chest pain — symptom characterization and terminology — should be considered acute when it is new onset or involves a change in pattern, intensity, or duration compared with previous episodes in a patient with recurrent symptoms, and should be considered stable when symptoms are chronic and associated with consistent precipitants such as exertion or emotional stress. Although the term chest pain is used in clinical practice, patients often report pressure, tightness, squeezing, heaviness, or burning, and a more appropriate term is "chest discomfort"; patients may also report a location other than the chest, including the shoulder, arm, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw. Features more likely to be associated with ischemia have been described as typical versus atypical; however, the latter can be confusing because it is frequently used to describe symptoms considered nonischemic as well as noncardiac, and pain — described as sharp, fleeting, related to inspiration (pleuritic) or position, or shifting locations — suggests a lower likelihood of ischemia.

### Rare clinical manifestation of community-acquired pneumonia [^115RhEiH]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

A 71-year-old patient was admitted due to fever and persistent (> 48hours) hiccups. History and physical examination were not instructive. Lab tests were not specific, showing an inflammatory response. Chest film did not demonstrate opacities. The patient was treated with chlorpromazine with no relief. Fever and hiccups persisted, and therefore neck and chest CT was performed revealing a right lower lobe infiltrate, a finding consistent with pneumonia. Antibiotics were initiated and within 48hours fever and hiccups resolved and patient recovered. Although hiccups are rarely described as a clinical manifestation of community acquired pneumonia, one should consider this diagnosis in a patient with unexplained fever.

Chest pain — terminology and characterization — emphasizes precise language and symptom context: Chest pain should be considered acute when it is new onset or involves a change in pattern, intensity, or duration compared with previous episodes in a patient with recurrent symptoms, and chest pain should be considered stable when symptoms are chronic and associated with consistent precipitants such as exertion or emotional stress. Because patients may not use the descriptor "pain", a more appropriate term is "chest discomfort". Features more likely to be associated with ischemia have been described as typical versus atypical; however, the latter can be confusing because it is frequently used to describe symptoms considered nonischemic as well as noncardiac. Pain — described as sharp, fleeting, related to inspiration (pleuritic) or position, or shifting locations — suggests a lower likelihood of ischemia.

Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes — symptom quality, timing, location, and modifiers: Anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort (eg, pain, discomfort, heaviness, tightness, pressure, constriction, squeezing), and sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease. Anginal symptoms gradually build in intensity over a few minutes, whereas fleeting chest pain of few seconds' duration is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Sudden onset of ripping chest pain with radiation to the upper or lower back is unlikely to be anginal and is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome, and pain that can be localized to a very limited area or radiating to below the umbilicus or hip is unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Ripping chest pain, "worse chest pain of my life", especially when sudden in onset and occurring in a hypertensive patient or with a known bicuspid aortic valve or aortic dilation, is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Physical exercise or emotional stress are common triggers of anginal symptoms, occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS, and positional chest pain is usually nonischemic. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common symptoms associated with myocardial ischemia include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, or heartburn unrelated to meals and nausea or vomiting, and symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing, sharp pain, or discomfort in the throat or abdomen may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

CHEST strength of recommendations — strong recommendations are graded 1A, 1B, and 1C with specified evidence and implications. Strong recommendation, high-quality evidence (1A): Benefits clearly outweigh risk and burden, or vice versa; Consistent evidence from randomized controlled trials without important limitations or exceptionally strong evidence from observational studies; Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect. Strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence (1B): Benefits clearly outweigh risk and burden, or vice versa; Evidence from randomized controlled trials with important limitations (inconsistent results, methodologic flaws, indirect or imprecise), or very strong evidence from observational studies; Recommendation can apply to most patients in most circumstances. Higher quality research may well have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. Strong recommendation, low or very low-quality evidence (1C): Benefits clearly outweigh risk and burden, or vice versa; Evidence for at least one critical outcome from observational studies, case series, or from randomized, controlled trials with serious flaws or indirect evidence; Recommendation can apply to most patients in many circumstances. Higher quality research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may well change the estimate.

### Management of ingested foreign bodies in children: a clinical report of the NASPGHAN endoscopy committee [^114iHUbL]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2015). Medium credibility.

Pediatric foreign body ingestion — epidemiology, presentation, and object categories — is characterized by high incidence in young children and predominantly accidental exposures; in 2000 the American Association of Poison Control Centers documented that 75% of the > 116,000 ingestions reported were in children 5 years of age or younger, and as opposed to adults, 98% of foreign body ingestions (FBIs) in children are accidental and involve common objects found in the home environment, such as coins, toys, jewelry, magnets, and batteries. Children may present with overt symptoms, including, but not limited to, stridor, pain, drooling, fussiness, chest pain, abdominal pain, fever, feeding refusal, wheezing, and respiratory distress, although they may be completely asymptomatic but brought in after ingestion witnessed by a caretaker. For scope and classification, FBIs will be categorized into the following major groups: button batteries (BBs), sharps/sharp-pointed objects, food impactions, coins/blunt objects, and superabsorbent objects, and management of categories considered toxic ingestions is outside the scope of the present article.

Initial evaluation — synopsis and comprehensive history elements in the emergency department (ED): Patients presenting to the ED with nontraumatic chest pain are a frequent diagnostic challenge. The priorities are rapid initiation of optimal management for life-threatening conditions such as acute coronary syndromes (ACS), aortic dissection, and pulmonary embolism (PE), as well as nonvascular syndromes (eg, esophageal rupture, tension pneumothorax), and deliberate therapy for those with less critical illness. The initial electrocardiogram (ECG) is important to the evaluation, but history, examination, biomarkers, and other aids remain essential, and there is frequently a lack of correlation between intensity of symptoms and seriousness of disease. A comprehensive history that captures chest pain characteristics — nature, onset and duration, location and radiation, precipitating factors, relieving factors, and associated symptoms — can help better identify potential cardiac causes and should be obtained from all patients.

### Persistent hiccups as an atypical presenting complaint of COVID-19 [^115BAsiQ]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Hiccups (singultus) are reflex inspiratory movements that involve the swallowing reflex arc and can be classified as acute (< 48 h) or persistent (> 48 h). A 62-year-old man with no history of malignancy or pulmonary disease presented to the Emergency Department with a four-day history of persistent hiccups. Other than episodic hiccupping, his physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. An abnormal chest X-ray led to a CT scan of the chest with IV contrast, which demonstrated regional, peripheral groundglass opacities of the upper lobes with small focal groundglass opacities scattered throughout the lungs. He was tested for COVID-19 per admission protocol, started on hydroxychloroquine, his hiccups improved, and he was discharged to home after 3 days. An emergency medicine physician should keep COVID-19 on the differential and be vigilant of exposure in atypical presentations.

### Stenting in palliation of unresectable esophageal cancer [^113d28aJ]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Minor complications

After esophageal stenting, 241 (54.5%) patients reported chest pain: in 28 (6.3%) patients with stent in the proximal esophagus, in 94 (21.2%) — in the middle part, in 78 (17.6%) — in the lower part and in 49 (11.0%) — in the EGJ. Pain occurred more frequently in patients with stents the proximal and middle part of the esophagus (p = 0.004). In 209 (42.3%) patients, mild analgesia was required and the pain subsided within 2–4 days after the procedure, whereas in 33 (7.5%) patients long-term analgetic medication was needed.

Incomplete immediate stent expansion occurred in 53 (12.0%) patients. In all of them, the stent expanded fully without any intervention within 48 h.

Difficulties in swallowing, associated with the feeling of a foreign body, were reported by 112 (25.3%) patients, including 29 (6.6%) with a stent in the proximal esophagus, 30 (6.8%) — in the middle part, in 21 (4.8%) — in the lower part and in 29 (5.7%) of them after the stenting of OGJ. The feeling of a foreign body was present only in patients with stents in the proximal part of the esophagus (p = 0.0001). These symptoms subsided completely or partially within 3–7 days.

Hiccup occurred in 7 (1.6%) patients after esophageal stenting: In 4 of them, it happened after stenting of the EGJ and required stent removal in 3 cases, and in 3 (0.7%) patients after stenting of the lower part of the thoracic esophagus (p = 0.02), requiring stent removal in 1 (0.2%) patient. In 3 patients with squamous cell carcinoma and in 4 with OGJ, carcinoma early migration of the stent occurred. Two hundred and two (45.6%) patients reported reflux symptoms, and they required treatment with proton-pump inhibitors. After discharge from the hospital, in 11 (2.5%) patients pneumonia occurred and they received outpatient treatment.

### Pleuritic chest pain: sorting through the differential diagnosis [^113G3N6G]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Pleuritic chest pain is characterized by sudden and intense sharp, stabbing, or burning pain in the chest when inhaling and exhaling. Pulmonary embolism is the most common serious cause, found in 5% to 21% of patients who present to an emergency department with pleuritic chest pain. A validated clinical decision rule for pulmonary embolism should be employed to guide the use of additional tests such as d-dimer assays, ventilation-perfusion scans, or computed tomography angiography. Myocardial infarction, pericarditis, aortic dissection, pneumonia, and pneumothorax are other serious causes that should be ruled out using history and physical examination, electrocardiography, troponin assays, and chest radiography before another diagnosis is made. Validated clinical decision rules are available to help exclude coronary artery disease. Viruses are common causative agents of pleuritic chest pain. Coxsackieviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, parainfluenza, mumps, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus are likely pathogens. Treatment is guided by the underlying diagnosis. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are appropriate for pain management in those with virally triggered or nonspecific pleuritic chest pain. In patients with persistent symptoms, persons who smoke, and those older than 50 years with pneumonia, it is important to document radiographic resolution with repeat chest radiography six weeks after initial treatment.

2021 Chest Pain Guideline — symptom characterization and terminology states that the sensation produced by myocardial ischemia is characteristically deep, difficult to localize, and usually diffuse, and that point tenderness renders ischemia less likely. It is essential to ascertain the characteristics of the chest pain directly from the patient for optimal interpretation, and the diagnosis of ischemia may require data beyond history alone, with some patients having noncardiac chest pain that may be ischemic in origin. Chest pain more likely associated with ischemia consists of substernal chest discomfort provoked by exertion or emotional stress and relieved by rest or nitroglycerin, and the more classic the chest discomfort is based on quality, location, radiation, and provoking and relieving factors, the more likely it is to be of cardiac ischemic origin. Atypical chest pain is a problematic term, and, as stated, we discourage the use of atypical chest pain; to diminish ambiguity, use "cardiac", "possible cardiac", and "noncardiac" to describe the suspected cause of chest pain is encouraged, and chest pain is broadly defined to also include referred pain in the shoulders, arms, jaw, neck, and upper abdomen.

Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Defining chest pain — recommendations (class of recommendation [COR] and level of evidence [LOE]) — include that an initial assessment of chest pain is recommended to triage patients effectively on the basis of the likelihood that symptoms may be attributable to myocardial ischemia (COR 1, LOE B-NR). The guideline also states that chest pain should not be described as atypical, because it is not helpful in determining the cause and can be misinterpreted as benign in nature; instead, chest pain should be described as cardiac, possibly cardiac, or noncardiac because these terms are more specific to the potential underlying diagnosis (COR 1, LOE C-LD).

### Intractable hiccups as a rare gastrointestinal manifestation in severe endocrine and metabolic crisis: case report and review of the literature [^115vWaJv]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

In the present case, evaluation results on the usual causes of intractable hiccups were negative. Firstly, we excluded almost all neurologic causes with computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and cerebrospinal fluid examination. Neither acute haemorrhagic nor ischaemic lesions was found in the patient. Secondly, because area postrema syndrome, as one typing of neuromyelitis optica, may be characterized by intractable hiccup, nausea and vomiting that cannot be explained by other causes, MR imaging shows a T2-hyperintense in dorsal medulla/area postrema lesion, the cause of hiccup in this patient should be considered. However, AQP4-IgG monitoring was not conducted because MR imaging did not show positive manifestation, and cerebrospinal fluid examination was not found abnormal. Importantly, the hiccup was eventually relieved after aggressive treatment on TS. All these do not support the diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica. Thirdly, negative CT scan of chest excluded pleurisy, pneumonia, enlarged lymph nodes, mediastinitis, mediastinal tumour. Fourthly, some digestive system diseases which may cause hiccup, such as abdominal abscess, pancreatitis, biliary tract diseases, abdominal tumours, intestinal obstruction, have been excluded with clinical manifestation and CT scan of the abdomen. Gastroscopy was not performed because the patient's severe clinical condition would not have tolerated it. Furthermore, proton pump inhibitor and gastric mucosal protectants cannot take effect to hiccups, which was supported that peptic ulcer, gastritis, duodenitis might not be the reason of hiccups. Finally, acute myocardial infarction was not considered because the patient's clinical symptoms, electrocardiogram and myocardial zymogram were not supported.

### Hiccups as the presenting manifestation of cardiac tamponade: a case report [^117NnaLi]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening disease with a high mortality rate. Its clinical manifestations depend on the length of time over which pericardial effusion accumulates. Among those, hiccups are rarely reported.

Case Report

We present a 48-year-old man who came in with a chief complaint of persistent hiccups and later had hypotension and dyspnea at the emergency department. Electrocardiogram revealed diffuse ST elevation with mildly elevated cardiac enzymes. Echocardiography showed massive pericardial effusion, implying cardiac tamponade. Catheter pericardiocentesis was performed and massive pericardial effusion was drained. Hiccups subsided after the procedure and the patient recovered uneventfully. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of cardiac tamponade with the presenting manifestation of persistent hiccups. Emergency physicians should stay vigilant when approaching those patients with unexplainable prolonged hiccups.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes — Anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort (eg, pain, discomfort, heaviness, tightness, pressure, constriction, squeezing) and anginal symptoms gradually build in intensity over a few minutes, whereas fleeting chest pain of few seconds' duration is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease, and sudden onset of ripping chest pain with radiation to the back is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Pain localized to a very limited area or radiating below the umbilicus or hip is unlikely related to myocardial ischemia, and positional chest pain is usually nonischemic. Physical exercise or emotional stress are common triggers of anginal symptoms, and occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common symptoms associated with myocardial ischemia include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, or heartburn unrelated to meals and nausea or vomiting; symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing or sharp pain, or throat/abdomen discomfort may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

### Intractable hiccups as a rare gastrointestinal manifestation in severe endocrine and metabolic crisis: case report and review of the literature [^117EFmap]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

TS has been reported in 0.20 people per 100,000 in the Japanese population annually and occurs in 0.22% of patients with thyrotoxicosis.TS is a life-threatening exacerbation of hyperthyroidism that has a very high mortality rate of 8–25%. Symptoms and signs of endocrine crisis may overlap with those of other severe disease states. In general, failure to recognize endocrine crises results in delayed diagnosis, and a lack of rapid specific therapy may have fatal consequences. Therefore, the early identification of TS is very important to reduce the mortality rate. TS is characterized by decompensation of multiple organ functions, leading to severe clinical manifestations such as high fever, disturbed consciousness, marked tachycardia, congestive heart failure, and gastrointestinal and hepatic disturbances.TS usually occurs in patients with previously undiagnosed or poorly treated hyperthyroidism, even subclinical hyperthyroidism. Graves' disease is a leading cause of TS and may be the first clinical presentation. The usual cause of TS is associated with infection, withdrawal of anti-thyroid drugs, radioiodine therapy, surgical procedure and severe emotional stress. Common clinical manifestations are central nervous system manifestations and gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Diarrhoea is the most common gastrointestinal symptom in thyrotoxicosis as well as in TS. The literature related to TS was searched from 2016 to 2019, and the clinical characteristics of gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with TS were found to mainly be nausea, and the main cause of TS to be Graves' disease with unknown or poor compliance with anti-thyroid drugs (Table 3). -

### Slipping rib syndrome: an elusive diagnosis [^114ycQPj]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Slipping rib syndrome remains rarely recognized and frequently undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. Awareness of this condition may prevent extensive and unnecessary diagnostic evaluation and avoid chronic debilitating pain. Persistent lower chest and/or upper abdomen pain after analgesic treatment may suggest the possibility of this disorder. The diagnosis of this syndrome, is a clinical one, based on history and the hooking maneuver. A few cases have been published in the literature, giving no clear consensus about the treatment of this condition. In this overview article, clinical manifestations, diagnostic approach, and treatment modalities of this syndrome will be discussed.

### 2021 AHA / ACC / ASE / CHEST / SAEM / SCCT / SCMR guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111tS442]. Journal of Cardiovascular Computed Tomography (2021). High credibility.

Chest pain characteristics and corresponding causes (Table 3) note that anginal symptoms are perceived as retrosternal chest discomfort and typically build in intensity over a few minutes. Sharp chest pain that increases with inspiration and lying supine is unlikely related to ischemic heart disease, and fleeting chest pain — of few seconds' duration — is unlikely to be related to ischemic heart disease. Sudden onset of ripping chest pain (with radiation to the upper or lower back) is unlikely to be angina and is suspicious of an acute aortic syndrome. Pain that can be localized to a very limited area or that radiates to below the umbilicus or hip is unlikely related to myocardial ischemia. Occurrence at rest or with minimal exertion associated with anginal symptoms usually indicates ACS, whereas positional chest pain is usually nonischemic. Relief with nitroglycerin is not necessarily diagnostic of myocardial ischemia and should not be used as a diagnostic criterion. Common symptoms associated with myocardial ischemia include dyspnea, palpitations, diaphoresis, lightheadedness, presyncope or syncope, upper abdominal pain, heartburn unrelated to meals, and nausea or vomiting; symptoms on the left or right side of the chest, stabbing or sharp pain, or throat/abdominal discomfort may occur in patients with diabetes, women, and elderly patients.

### Singultus: avoiding a hiccup in care [^112UMJpV]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Hiccups (singultus) is often a benign, common and self- limited condition. A case of profound electrolyte disturbances presenting with chief complaint of hiccups is presented in which chlorpromazine was not administered and could have been problematic had it been given. For those who present to the ED with chief complaint of hiccups, it is critical to consider a life threatening etiology as the cause of their symptom. This case presents a potential pitfall in the management of singultus.

### Case of chest pain in a young man [^115a2eYk]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

A young man with a history of smoking presented with acute-onset chest pain after lifting weights. He also noticed a change in his voice, tightness in his neck and difficulty breathing. A chest radiograph showed soft tissue emphysema in the neck. A CT scan of the chest revealed moderate amount of pneumomediastinum tracking into the neck and down to the diaphragm. He was haemodynamically stable and had no hypoxia or dysphagia. He was monitored for 48hours and discharged home after resolution of his symptoms. A chest radiograph repeated after 6 weeks was normal.

### Perspectives on the medical, quality of life, and economic consequences of hiccups [^116SHbis]. Current Oncology Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Singultus or hiccups (HU) is a common, usually temporary, event. Its potentially serious consequences are often overlooked. This review explores published evidence describing HU burden (clinical, economic, and quality of life [QoL] consequences) across patient populations.

Recent Findings

Literature review identified 81 articles (including 57 individual case reports). We extracted relevant information to better understand the burden of HU and to identify knowledge gaps for future study. HU are physiologic events that can complicate existing medical conditions and treatments regardless of duration. Relatively short episodes can have devastating consequences in patients who have pre-existing conditions. HU appear to impact physical and psychological health, diminish QoL, increase healthcare resource use, and increase costs. A better understanding of HU burden is needed.

### Interventions for treating persistent and intractable hiccups in adults [^112vR4G9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Persistent and intractable hiccups (typically defined as lasting for more than 48 hours and one month respectively) can be of serious detriment to a patient's quality of life, although they are relatively uncommon. A wide range of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions have been used for the treatment of persistent and intractable hiccups. However, there is little evidence as to which interventions are effective or harmful.

Objectives

The objective of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions used in the treatment of persistent and intractable hiccups of any aetiology in adults.

Search Methods

Studies were identified from the following databases: CENTRAL, CDSR, DARE, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsychINFO and SIGLE (last search March 2012). The search strategy for all the databases searched was based on the MEDLINE search strategy presented in Appendix 1. No additional handsearching of journals was undertaken. Investigators who are known to be carrying out research in this area were contacted for unpublished data or knowledge of the grey literature.

Selection Criteria

Studies eligible for inclusion in this review were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs).

Inclusion Criteria

adults (over 18 years old) diagnosed with persistent or intractable hiccups (hiccups lasting more than 48 hours), treated with any pharmacological or non-pharmacological intervention.

Exclusion Criteria

less than ten participants; no assessment of change in hiccup frequency or intensity in outcome measures.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two independent review authors assessed each abstract and title for relevance. Disagreement on eligibility was resolved by discussion. Where no abstract was available the full paper was obtained and assessed. We obtained full copies of the studies which met the inclusion criteria for further assessment. Two review authors independently collected data from each appropriate study and entered them into the software Review Manager 5. Two independent review authors assessed the risk of bias using the RevMan 5 'Risk of bias' table following guidance from the Cochrane Handbook of Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2009).

Main Results

A total of four studies (305 participants) met the inclusion criteria. All of these studies sought to determine the effectiveness of different acupuncture techniques in the treatment of persistent and intractable hiccups. All four studies had a high risk of bias, did not compare the intervention with placebo, and failed to report side effects or adverse events for either the treatment or control groups. Due to methodological differences we were unable to perform a meta-analysis of the results. No studies investigating pharmacological interventions for persistent and intractable hiccups met the inclusion criteria.

Authors' Conclusions

There is insufficient evidence to guide the treatment of persistent or intractable hiccups with either pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions. The paucity of high quality studies indicate a need for randomised placebo-controlled trials of both pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. As the symptom is relatively rare, trials would need to be multi-centred and possibly multi-national.

### Pediatric sharp foreign body aspiration: revealing unexpected risk factors [^115h8BSi]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinically, sharp FBA presented with classical symptoms of FBA, such as coughing (79.2%) and choking (45.8%), with the addition of chest pain and hemoptysis observed in 27.1% and 18.8% of the patients, respectively (Table 3). Preoperative physical exam revealed wheezing (37.5%) and decreased air entry (35.4%) as the most frequent findings (Table 4). Of note, 35.4% of patients had no preoperative physical exam findings. Preoperative chest radiography was efficacious in visualizing 43 of 48 (89.6%) sharp foreign bodies, except for the plastic star, the sharp piece of lego, the star‐shaped metal craft, the cogwheel, and the pop can tab. All thumbtacks aspirated were detected on radiography. Additional radiographic findings notably included two cases of pneumothorax (4.2%) and five cases of pneumonia (10.4%) (Table 5).

Table 5
Preoperative Chest Radiography Findings in Pediatric Patients With Sharp Foreign Body Aspiration

Perioperative Findings and Complications

In the majority of cases of aspiration, the foreign body was removed with forceps during rigid bronchoscopy. One case of a sewing needle aspirated in a left lower lobe bronchus required the involvement of the Respirology team, whose specialized instruments were successfully used to retrieve the foreign body through rigid bronchoscopy. Another case involving a subglottic star‐shaped metal craft required suspension microlaryngoscopy for foreign body removal. Additionally, three cases involving thumbtacks and one case involving a hairclip became lodged at the level of the glottis during the removal of the foreign body, necessitating direct laryngoscopy and removal with forceps. All patients had a final rigid bronchoscopy before the end of the procedure to ensure there was no secondary foreign body in the respiratory system.

### Asymptomatic costal exostosis with thickening in the pericardium: a case report [^112qq14r]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Exostosis has accounted for 50% of primary benign bone tumors and has been observed to occur at the metaphysis of long bones or originate from the surface of flat bones. It generally occurs at the proximal femoral or distal tibial metaphysis. Exostosis of the rib makes up a small proportion of the cases of exostosis.

Primary exostosis occurs as solitary or multifocal lesions, and multiple exostosis is a hereditary disease that occurs in infants. Hereditary multiple exostosis is a rare disorder characterized by the formation of exostoses in many locations. It is associated with mutations in the EXT genes and is manifested by skeletal deformities caused by abnormal bone growth.

Solitary exostosis occurs in both infants and adults, and is generally asymptomatic. When an X-ray diagnosis of an asymptomatic case is not definitive, a chest CT is useful. Symptomatic cases of costal exostosis have presented with swelling, hiccup, chest pain, pneumothorax, or hemothorax. Hemothorax is thought to result from trauma caused by the costal exostosis to the pleura, diaphragm, lung, or heart. Cases at risk of life-threatening damage to intrathoracic organs should be resected surgically.

Past reports of organ damage due to costal exostosis have described longitudinal lacerations of the diaphragm and pericardium adjacent to the tip of the exostosis that were caused by movements during respiration. Even in cases such as ours, with asymptomatic anterior left fifth costal exostosis, histopathological changes were seen in the pericardium and lung. In a patient with anterior left fourth rib exostosis, thickened pericardium and visceral pleura possibly caused by scratch have been reported. Although in our patient the distance between an intrathoracic organ and the exostosis was long, life-threatening damage to an intrathoracic organ due to respiratory movements was possible. Even if the tip of protrusion seems apart enough from the pericardium or diaphragm, anterior costal exostosis can come in touch with these intrathoracic organs during the movement of the chest wall, resulting in just a scratch or a fatal injury according to the strength of the external pressure. Therefore, preventive surgical treatment should be considered especially for the anterior left costal exostosis.

### 'What puts the 'hic' into hiccups?' [^116ZaThT]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Recurrent and persistent bouts of hiccups impact the quality of life by interfering with eating, social interaction and work. Popular home remedies, such as breath holding and drinking ice water, target activity in the vagal and phrenic nerves that are thought to trigger these repetitive, myoclonic contractions. However, the pathophysiology of hiccups and the mechanism by which any of these methods work are unclear. Indeed, so little is known that there is no agreement whether the 'Hic' sound is due to the abrupt closure of the epiglottis or the glottis, including the vocal cords.

Investigations were performed in a 50-year-old, otherwise healthy male with recurrent hiccups, in whom contractions persisted for up to 4 hours. Hiccups were initiated by drinking carbonated soda. The aerodigestive tract was visualised by video fluoroscopy. Hiccups were terminated by drinking a non-viscous contrast agent through a forced inspiratory suction and swallow tool. This device requires significant suction pressure (−100 mm Hg) to draw fluid into the mouth and is effective in approximately 90% of cases. The images were analysed together with concurrent audio recordings to gain insight into 'what causes the 'hic' in hiccups' and how this commonplace but annoying problem can be treated.

SIDE EFFECTS OF ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES

Vaginal bleeding

Irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting may occur while you are taking the pills. Irregular bleeding may vary from slight staining between menstrual periods to breakthrough bleeding, which is a flow much like a regular period. Irregular bleeding occurs most often during the first few months of oral contraceptive use, but may also occur after you have been taking the pill for some time. Such bleeding may be temporary and usually does not indicate any serious problems. It is important to continue taking your pills on schedule. If the bleeding occurs in more than one cycle or lasts for more than a few days, talk to your doctor or healthcare provider.

### Effective combination of isolated symptom variables to help stratifying acute undifferentiated chest pain in the emergency department [^113NFeHk]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

In this study, we developed a CPSS to assist in the prediction of 30‐day AMI or death in acute undifferentiated chest pain presenting to the ED with negative initial cTn over 3 hours after symptom onset. The CPSS served as an independent predictor and performed excellent in both the derivation and validation cohort. Moreover, the CPSS combined with the HEART risk score improved the discriminatory capacity of the old model and allowed the classification of risk levels significantly better. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to derivate and validate the statistical combination of symptom features for diagnosis or prediction of AMI/death in chest pain patients.

This CPSS compromised seven predictors in four aspects of chest pain symptom. The substernal pain, left arm pain, diaphoresis, and vomiting were shown to be significant predictors of AMI in accordance with other studies. 20, 21, 22 Some chest pain characteristics considered as "high‐risk" in the HEART score were found to have no significant diagnostic or prognostic value, like exertional pain and relief with nitroglycerin. Besides, the reported "low‐risk" variables 21 (stabbing/sharp character, influenced by posture/breathing/cough, etc.) were also shown to be of no importance.

### Oxcarbazepine [^11237AL4]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Other Events Observed in Association with the Administration of Oxcarbazepine Tablets

In the paragraphs that follow, the adverse reactions, other than those in the preceding tables or text, that occurred in a total of 565 children and 1,574 adults exposed to oxcarbazepine tablets and that are reasonably likely to be related to drug use are presented. Events common in the population, events reflecting chronic illness and events likely to reflect concomitant illness are omitted particularly if minor. They are listed in order of decreasing frequency. Because the reports cite events observed in open label and uncontrolled trials, the role of oxcarbazepine tablets in their causation cannot be reliably determined.

### 2021 AHA / ACC / ASE / CHEST / SAEM / SCCT / SCMR guideline for the evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain: executive summary: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^111MyB1K]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Top 10 take-home messages — evaluation and diagnosis of chest pain emphasize that chest pain means more than pain in the chest; pain, pressure, tightness, or discomfort in the chest, shoulders, arms, neck, back, upper abdomen, or jaw, as well as shortness of breath and fatigue should all be considered anginal equivalents. High-sensitivity troponins are preferred for biomarker diagnosis; high-sensitivity cardiac troponins are the preferred standard for establishing a biomarker diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, allowing for more accurate detection and exclusion of myocardial injury. Early care for acute symptoms is stressed; patients with acute chest pain or chest pain equivalent symptoms should seek medical care immediately by calling 9–1–1, and although most patients will not have a cardiac cause, the evaluation of all patients should focus on the early identification or exclusion of life-threatening causes.

### 'What puts the 'hic' into hiccups?' [^116ffCW2]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Recurrent and persistent bouts of hiccups impact the quality of life by interfering with eating, social interaction and work. These repetitive, myoclonic contractions are maintained by a reflex arc that consists of an afferent sensory limb (includes vagus nerve and sympathetic chain), an integration centre in the spinal cord and brainstem, and an efferent motor limb that involves the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm and accessory nerves to the intercostal muscles. This activity draws air into the lungs that is, within a few milliseconds, interrupted by closure of the upper airway producing the characteristic sound, the 'hic' in hiccups. Popular home remedies, such as breath holding and drinking ice water, seek to interrupt this neuromuscular relay. However, the pathophysiology of hiccups and the mechanism by which any of these methods work are unclear. Indeed, so little is known that there is no agreement whether the 'Hic' sound is due to the abrupt closure of the epiglottis or the glottis, including the vocal cords.

Investigations were performed in a 50-year-old, otherwise healthy male with recurrent hiccups, in whom contractions can persist for up to 4 hours. This unique experiment was possible because hiccups could be reproducibly initiated in this volunteer by drinking carbonated soda. The aerodigestive tract was visualised using video-fluoroscopy by drinking a non-viscous, barium sulfate suspension through a 'forced inspiratory suction and swallow tool' (FISST). This device has been described previously and patients report that its use terminates hiccups in more than 90% of cases (figure 1).FISST uses Bernoulli's principle to generate a high-negative, intrathoracic, suction pressure (−100 cmH₂O). This draws fluid through a small orifice in a rigid drinking tube into the mouth, an action that is immediately followed by swallowing. The images were analysed together with simultaneous audio recordings to gain insight into 'what causes the 'hic' in hiccups' (video 1).
