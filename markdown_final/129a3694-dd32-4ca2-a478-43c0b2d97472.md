## Question

What is Ventilator Associated Pneumonia

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is, how it is defined, why it matters, how it is diagnosed, how to treat it, and how to prevent it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal definition and timing thresholds. Then, I should verify the epidemiology and burden. Next, I will examine the pathophysiology and risk factors. After that, I need to review diagnostic challenges and the role of microbiology. Then, I will outline evidence-based treatment principles, including empiric therapy, duration, and de-escalation. Finally, I should appraise prevention strategies, including bundles and ventilator-associated events, and close with special populations and controversies, making sure I double-check any points that seem uncertain or contradictory as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and timing. VAP is a nosocomial pneumonia occurring more than 48 hours after endotracheal intubation and initiation of mechanical ventilation, and it is distinct from hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) that occurs in non-ventilated patients, with HAP and VAP considered mutually exclusive categories in guideline frameworks, which I should explicitly state to avoid conflation [^111XxFSy] [^115dap3u].

> I need to check the epidemiology and burden next. Incidence estimates vary widely with the diagnostic criteria used, ranging from roughly 5% to 40% of ventilated patients, and event rates commonly cited between about 1.4 and 16.5 per 1,000 ventilator days; attributable mortality is often around 10% in contemporary analyses, though estimates range from near-neutral to higher in selected cohorts, and VAP consistently prolongs mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay and increases costs, with U.S. estimates around $40,000 per episode and UK estimates around £9,000, so I should be careful to frame these figures as population- and method-dependent [^117AZcok] [^112B5x7T] [^115dH7Pb] [^111Gpxq4].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about pathophysiology without verifying the dominant mechanisms. The endotracheal tube bypasses upper airway defenses, permits microaspiration of oropharyngeal and gastric secretions past the cuff, and facilitates biofilm formation; pathogens are often endogenous gram-negative bacilli and Staphylococcus aureus, with multidrug-resistant organisms more likely with prior antibiotics, prolonged ventilation, or specific host factors, so I should emphasize that intubation itself is the principal risk and that local epidemiology drives pathogen distribution [^115dH7Pb] [^115MQd7u] [^111r8ngX].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic challenge before proposing any algorithm. There is no gold standard for VAP; diagnosis relies on integrating new infiltrates with clinical signs such as fever, leukocytosis, purulent secretions, and worsening oxygenation, but these features are nonspecific and overlap with ARDS, atelectasis, pulmonary edema, and drug reactions; the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) can aid assessment but has limited accuracy and should be interpreted cautiously, especially in ARDS or immunocompromise; quantitative cultures from bronchoalveolar lavage or endotracheal aspirates are commonly used, yet even microbiologic thresholds vary across studies and guidelines, reinforcing the need to integrate clinical and lab data rather than rely on any single test [^111XxFSy] [^111gALD3] [^113pFQdC] [^112B5x7T].

> I should double-check the role of surveillance definitions here. The CDC's ventilator-associated events (VAE) framework was introduced to improve objectivity and reproducibility for quality surveillance; it captures a broader set of ventilator complications and correlates with worse outcomes, but only a subset of clinically diagnosed VAP cases meet VAE criteria, so VAEs complement rather than replace bedside VAP diagnosis, and I need to ensure I do not conflate VAE surveillance with clinical diagnosis [^1122E7BS] [^112mWKkS] [^115NMq2x].

> Next, I should review empiric therapy principles and confirm MRSA and antipseudomonal coverage. Guidelines recommend empiric coverage for S. aureus (include MRSA when risk factors are present or local MRSA prevalence exceeds 10–20%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other gram-negative bacilli, with dual antipseudomonal therapy reserved for patients with risk factors for multidrug resistance, units with high resistance rates, or those in septic shock or at high risk of death; I should confirm that these are strong recommendations despite low-to-moderate quality evidence, reflecting mortality stakes and the cost of delay [^111a5rf5] [^11411vru] [^1169hd3S] [^111SjvXe].

> Let me think about duration and de-escalation, because overtreatment is common. A 7-day course is recommended for most patients with VAP, with daily reassessment to affirm ongoing infection, prompt narrowing when susceptibilities return, and consideration of stopping if cultures are negative and clinical suspicion wanes; I should confirm that this balances efficacy with resistance mitigation and is supported by guideline consensus despite variable trial quality [^117YVWXp] [^117AZcok] [^115dap3u].

> I will now examine definitive therapy adjustments and special pathogens. For confirmed MRSA, vancomycin or linezolid are preferred; for Pseudomonas, therapy should be tailored to susceptibilities, and while combination therapy has not shown benefit over active monotherapy in most settings, it may be reasonable in septic shock or high-risk scenarios; for carbapenem-resistant organisms, polymyxins such as colistin or polymyxin B are recommended when no alternatives exist, and I should emphasize that definitive choices must be anchored to local antibiograms and patient-specific factors [^111QukQv] [^113HmNwD] [^111Y4g57] [^1167b93v].

> But wait, what about biomarkers to stop antibiotics early. I initially thought procalcitonin could routinely guide discontinuation, but I should correct that: IDSA/ATS recommends using clinical criteria alone, not procalcitonin plus clinical criteria, to decide whether to start antibiotics in suspected VAP; however, emerging data suggest that bronchoalveolar lavage biomarkers such as IL-1β and IL-8 may help rule out VAP and support stewardship, as shown in the VAPrapid2 randomized trial, so I need to distinguish where biomarkers fit in current practice versus guideline positions [^115MuUiV] [^112A2k9o].

> Next, I should review prevention, and I need to ensure I separate what reduces VAP rates from what improves patient-centered outcomes. Core measures include minimizing mechanical ventilation exposure through daily sedation interruption and spontaneous awakening/breathing trials, head-of-bed elevation to 30–45 degrees, oral care with chlorhexidine, and strict hand hygiene and aseptic technique; ventilator bundles combining these elements reduce VAP incidence in many settings, though impacts on mortality are less consistent, and some practices like routine circuit changes are not beneficial and should be avoided unless soiled or malfunctioning [^116ppXLY] [^113hbiGf] [^116YDFDi].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of VAE prevention strategies because they may better align with outcomes. Interventions that reduce VAEs include minimizing sedation, paired daily awakening and breathing trials, conservative fluid management, low tidal volume ventilation, and early mobility; these are associated with fewer VAEs and may shorten ventilation duration, though high-quality VAE-prevention bundles have not been fully tested, so programs should prioritize measures with the strongest outcome signals while monitoring both VAP and VAE rates [^112mWKkS] [^1122E7BS] [^115NMq2x].

> Let me consider special populations and contexts. In pediatrics, VAP is common and associated with longer ventilation and higher mortality, and ventilator bundles reduce VAP rates; in COVID-19, prolonged ventilation, ARDS, and immunosuppression increase VAP risk and complicate diagnosis due to overlapping radiographic and clinical features; in trauma and burns, pathogen patterns and risks differ, reinforcing the need for local epidemiology to guide empiric therapy and prevention [^112Y4deX] [^116YDFDi] [^114rccaH] [^115MQd7u].

> I should double-check the controversies and quality-improvement implications before concluding. VAP definitions are heterogeneous across studies and hospitals, leading to wide variability in incidence and limiting comparability; surveillance-driven "zero VAP" campaigns may artifactually lower reported rates without improving outcomes, and VAP should not be used as a sole quality benchmark; instead, programs should track objective outcomes like ventilator days, ICU length of stay, mortality, antibiotic use, and VAEs, and adopt standardized diagnostic criteria where feasible to enable valid benchmarking and research [^114yR8pQ] [^115uEVqn] [^112VE1Jc] [^1126YPG4] [^1171F1ou].

> In summary, VAP is a hospital-acquired pneumonia arising more than 48 hours after intubation, driven by microaspiration and biofilm-related colonization, with substantial attributable morbidity and cost; diagnosis remains a clinical–microbiologic synthesis without a gold standard; empiric therapy should cover S. aureus and gram-negative bacilli with MRSA and dual antipseudomonal coverage when risk factors or local resistance patterns dictate; treatment should be shortened to 7 days with prompt de-escalation; and prevention hinges on minimizing ventilation exposure and implementing evidence-based bundles while measuring outcomes that matter to patients rather than VAP rates alone [^111XxFSy] [^115dH7Pb] [^11411vru] [^117YVWXp] [^1171F1ou].

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a **hospital-acquired lung infection** occurring in patients who have received mechanical ventilation for at least 48 hours [^111XxFSy]. It is defined by new or progressive infiltrates on chest imaging plus clinical signs of infection — fever, leukocytosis, purulent secretions, and worsening oxygenation — and is confirmed by microbiologic data from lower respiratory tract samples [^111XxFSy] [^113pFQdC]. VAP increases **ICU length of stay, mechanical ventilation duration, and mortality** [^114itA2o], with attributable mortality around 10–13% [^117AZcok] [^112hrKSv]. Diagnosis is challenging due to nonspecific clinical signs and the lack of a gold standard [^113pFQdC]; integrating clinical, radiologic, and microbiologic data is essential [^111XxFSy] [^113pFQdC]. Prevention relies on **evidence-based bundles** (e.g. head-of-bed elevation, oral care, sedation minimization, early weaning) [^1124hgdp] and antimicrobial stewardship; treatment requires timely, appropriate empiric therapy followed by de-escalation [^115dap3u] and a 7-day course [^117YVWXp] when clinically stable [^117AZcok].

---

## Definition and diagnostic criteria

VAP is defined by the following:

- **Timing**: Occurs ≥ 48 hours after intubation and initiation of mechanical ventilation [^111XxFSy].

- **Clinical signs**: New or progressive infiltrates on chest radiograph, plus at least two of: fever > 38°C or hypothermia < 36°C, leukocytosis or leukopenia, purulent tracheal secretions, or worsening oxygenation [^notfound].

- **Microbiologic confirmation**: Positive culture from lower respiratory tract samples (endotracheal aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage, or protected specimen brush) [^113emMxa].

---

## Pathophysiology

VAP arises from **microaspiration of contaminated oropharyngeal or gastric secretions** around the endotracheal tube cuff [^113DUoKb], with biofilm formation on tubing and impaired cough reflexes further increasing risk [^notfound]. Common pathogens include Gram-negative bacilli (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp.) and Gram-positive organisms (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus, including MRSA) [^115MQd7u].

---

## Risk factors

Several factors increase **VAP risk**:

- **Patient-related factors**: Older age, chronic lung disease, immunosuppression, malnutrition, and prolonged ICU stay [^111kf9Mq].

- **Ventilation-related factors**: Prolonged mechanical ventilation, repeated intubations, and high ventilator settings [^113yiBpc].

- **Healthcare practices**: Inadequate hand hygiene, poor oral care, and suboptimal infection control measures [^113DUoKb].

---

## Clinical outcomes and impact

VAP significantly worsens patient outcomes, including **prolonged mechanical ventilation and ICU stay** [^114itA2o], increased mortality (attributable mortality ~10–13%) [^117AZcok] [^112hrKSv], and higher healthcare costs (~$40,000 per episode in the US) [^112B5x7T]. It also increases antibiotic use and drives resistance [^115dH7Pb].

---

## Diagnosis challenges

Diagnosing VAP is difficult because **clinical signs are nonspecific** and can mimic other ICU conditions (e.g. ARDS, pulmonary edema) [^1126YPG4]. There is no gold standard, and variability in definitions and criteria leads to inconsistent incidence estimates [^111XxFSy] [^117UVYsD]. Integrating clinical, radiologic, and microbiologic data is essential [^115KoBrm].

---

## Prevention strategies

Effective prevention centers on **multicomponent care bundles**, including:

- **Head-of-bed elevation**: 30–45° [^116ppXLY].

- **Oral care**: Regular chlorhexidine mouthwash [^notfound].

- **Sedation minimization**: Daily sedation interruption and spontaneous awakening trials [^112mWKkS].

- **Early weaning**: Daily spontaneous breathing trials and early mobilization [^1122E7BS].

- **Infection control**: Strict hand hygiene and aseptic technique [^notfound].

---

## Treatment guidelines

Treatment requires **prompt empiric antibiotics** covering likely pathogens, followed by de-escalation based on cultures [^11411vru]. Empiric MRSA coverage is indicated in patients with risk factors or in units with > 10–20% MRSA prevalence [^111SjvXe]. The recommended treatment duration is 7 days for most patients, with longer courses reserved for complicated cases [^117YVWXp].

---

## Controversies and challenges

Controversies include the **lack of a gold standard** for diagnosis [^113pFQdC], variability in definitions [^114yR8pQ], and the paradox of declining VAP rates without corresponding improvements in patient outcomes [^112Mg9gj]. Overdiagnosis and overtreatment remain concerns, underscoring the need for better diagnostic tools and stewardship [^112A2k9o].

---

Ventilator-associated pneumonia is a significant, preventable ICU-acquired infection with substantial morbidity, mortality, and cost. Prevention through evidence-based bundles and antimicrobial stewardship, coupled with timely, appropriate therapy, are key to reducing its burden [^115NMxyb] [^115dap3u].

## References

### Ventilator associated pneumonia in the ICU: where has it gone? [^11647aeD]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To highlight the clinical importance of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in an era of escalating antimicrobial resistance.

Recent Findings

VAP continues to be an important infection in the critically ill. The development of rapid microbiologic diagnostics and new antimicrobial agents offer opportunities for improved treatment strategies for VAP balancing the need to treat effectively in a timely manner and antimicrobial stewardship. Additionally, the new surveillance definitions for assessing the quality of care in critically ill patients (ventilator-associated events, ventilator-associated conditions, and infection-related ventilator-associated conditions) do not appear to be adequate surrogates for the identification of VAP.

Summary

Clinicians caring for critically ill patients should be aware of the importance of correctly treating VAP. As new diagnostic technologies and antimicrobials become available for VAP, their incorporation into routine patient management should occur in a way that optimizes patient outcomes wherein minimizing further emergence of antimicrobial resistance.

### Is a ventilator-associated pneumonia rate of zero really possible? [^112VE1Jc]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The increasing number of hospitals reporting ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) rates at or close to zero begs the question of whether zero should become the national benchmark for VAP. This article explores the significance of very low VAP rates, reviews differences in surveillance and clinical rates, proposes reasons for their discrepancies, and suggests possible objective alternatives for surveillance.

Recent Findings

Surveillance rates of VAP are decreasing, whereas clinical diagnoses and antibiotic prescribing remain prevalent. This growing discrepancy reflects the lack of objective and definitive signs to diagnose VAP. External reporting pressures may be encouraging stricter interpretation of subjective signs and other surveillance initiatives that can artifactually lower rates. It is impossible to disentangle the relative contribution of care improvements versus surveillance effects to currently observed low VAP rates.

Summary

The increasing mismatch between surveillance rates and clinical diagnoses limits the utility of official VAP rates to estimate disease burden and guide quality improvement. Advocates are advised to consider objective alternatives such as average duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, mortality, and antibiotic prescribing. Emerging surveillance definitions that use more objective criteria may better reflect and inform future clinical practice.

### What is ventilator-associated pneumonia and why is it important? [^116BgErf]. Respiratory Care (2005). Low credibility.

Hospital-associated pneumonia (HAP) is one of the most common infections acquired among hospitalized patients. HAP is associated with excess mortality and increased medical care costs. The rise in HAP due to antibiotic-resistant bacteria has resulted in more common administration of inappropriate antimicrobial treatment, with an associated increased risk of hospital mortality. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) refers to HAP occurring in patients requiring mechanical ventilation. VAP is the most common nosocomial infection among patients with acute respiratory failure. Physicians treating patients with HAP and VAP should be aware of the predominant local pathogens associated with these infections and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. This will allow more appropriate initial antibiotic selection in order to optimize treatment regimens and clinical outcomes. Additionally, clinical strategies aimed at the prevention of HAP and VAP should be employed in all hospital settings caring for patients at risk for these infections.

### Diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia: is there a gold standard and a simple approach? [^113pFQdC]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia remains controversial. Different approaches are advocated, but none has yet demonstrated superiority. Diagnosis based on clinical data and aetiological diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia episodes are two concepts that should be combined in an integrative evaluation for ventilator-associated pneumonia. Recent findings in diagnosis are reviewed here.

Recent Findings

Studies of various diagnostic strategies have been conducted to evaluate whether they influence outcome. Strategies include use of biomarkers (e.g. C-reactive protein and procalcitonin) and use of clinical scores to render the diagnostic process more objective. The appropriateness of the available aetiological diagnostic techniques and their reliability in the absence of a 'gold standard' for diagnosis were also recently addressed. It remains controversial whether type of culture (quantitative or nonquantitative) or sampling method (invasive or noninvasive) influences aetiological diagnosis or outcomes in ventilator-associated pneumonia. It is unlikely that any single approach is the optimal diagnostic assessment whenever ventilator-associated pneumonia is suspected.

Summary

Microbiological data should always be used in association with clinical data when assessing patients with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia. Integration of these data might be the most simple and effective strategy for diagnosing ventilator-associated pneumonia.

### The paradox of ventilator-associated pneumonia prevention measures [^112Mg9gj]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

There is a striking paradox in the literature supporting high-profile measures to reduce ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): many studies show significant reductions in VAP rates but almost none show any impact on patients' duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital, or mortality. The paradox is largely attributable to lack of specificity in the VAP definition. The clinical and microbiological criteria for VAP capture a population of patients with an array of conditions that range from serious to benign. Many of the benign events are manifestations of bacterial colonization superimposed upon pulmonary edema, atelectasis, or other non-infectious processes. VAP prevention measures that work by decreasing bacterial colonization preferentially lower the frequency of these mislabelled, more benign events. In addition, misclassification obscures detection of an impact of prevention measures on bona fide pneumonias. Together, these effects create the possibility of the paradox where a prevention measure may have a large impact on VAP rates but minimal impact on patients' outcomes. The paradox makes changes in VAP rates alone an unreliable measure of whether VAP prevention measures are truly beneficial to patients and behooves us to measure their impact on patient outcomes before advocating their adoption.

### Preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia: does the evidence support the practice? [^114itA2o]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is among the most common infections in patients requiring endotracheal tubes with mechanical ventilation. Ventilator-associated pneumonia is associated with increased hospital costs, a greater number of days in the intensive care unit, longer duration of mechanical ventilation, and higher mortality. Despite widely accepted recommendations for interventions designed to reduce rates of VAP, few studies have assessed the ability of these interventions to improve patient outcomes. As the understanding of VAP advances and new technologies to reduce VAP become available, studies should directly assess patient outcomes before the health care community implements specific prevention approaches in clinical practice.

---

### Ventilator-associated pneumonia: insights from recent clinical trials [^112bSR5P]. Chest (2005). Low credibility.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most common nosocomial infection in the ICU and contributes disproportionately to both poor outcomes and the high cost of care in critically ill patients. While VAP has been the focus of extensive research, little consensus exists about methods for diagnosis, treatment, or prevention. Delays in initiating appropriate therapy, antibiotic resistance due to indiscriminate and prolonged use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and treatment of patients with a low risk of VAP (based on clinical pulmonary infection scores) represent a sample of VAP-related issues that have been addressed in recent clinical trials. Educational programs for VAP prevention and other nonpharmacologic strategies aimed at eliminating VAP have also been explored in clinical investigations. This review highlights selected areas of new clinical research on VAP treatment and prevention in order to place their significance in context.

### Ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults: a narrative review [^117AZcok]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is one of the most frequent ICU-acquired infections. Reported incidences vary widely from 5 to 40% depending on the setting and diagnostic criteria. VAP is associated with prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay. The estimated attributable mortality of VAP is around 10%, with higher mortality rates in surgical ICU patients and in patients with mid-range severity scores at admission. Microbiological confirmation of infection is strongly encouraged. Which sampling method to use is still a matter of controversy. Emerging microbiological tools will likely modify our routine approach to diagnosing and treating VAP in the next future. Prevention of VAP is based on minimizing the exposure to mechanical ventilation and encouraging early liberation. Bundles that combine multiple prevention strategies may improve outcomes, but large randomized trials are needed to confirm this. Treatment should be limited to 7 days in the vast majority of the cases. Patients should be reassessed daily to confirm ongoing suspicion of disease, antibiotics should be narrowed as soon as antibiotic susceptibility results are available, and clinicians should consider stopping antibiotics if cultures are negative.

### Asking the right questions: the relationship between incident ventilator-associated pneumonia and mortality [^111kdRZ5]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Whether ventilator-associated pneumonia is a manifestation of severity of illness or an independent cause of mortality in ventilator-dependent patients is not known. In this complex area, which cannot be readily subjected to randomized controlled trials, studies should focus on the underlying questions of relevance, how to improve care of ventilated patients.

---

### Evidence on measures for the prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia [^115NMxyb]. The European Respiratory Journal (2007). Low credibility.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) continues to be an important cause of morbidity and mortality in ventilated patients. Evidence-based guidelines have been issued since 2001 by the European Task Force on ventilator-associated pneumonia, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Canadian Critical Care Society, and also by the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America, which have produced a joint set of recommendations. The present review article is based on a comparison of these guidelines, together with an update of further publications in the literature. The 100,000 Lives campaign, endorsed by leading US agencies and societies, states that all ventilated patients should receive a ventilator bundle to reduce the incidence of VAP. The present review article is useful for identifying evidence-based processes that can be modified to improve patients' safety.

### Ventilator-associated pneumonia: the role of ventilator management strategies [^113yiBpc]. Respiratory Care (2005). Low credibility.

Ventilator management strategies can affect the risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia in 3 ways: the development of ventilator-induced lung injury; the need for potentially harmful tradeoffs in providing lung-protective ventilatory strategies; and the prolongation of the duration of mechanical ventilation from iatrogenic factors. Strategies to reduce ventilator-induced lung injury include a smaller tidal volume and careful attention to reducing the maximum pressures in the lung. These lung-protective strategies, however, may require tradeoffs with factors that may in themselves produce risks for ventilator-associated pneumonia. Specifically, hypercapnia, discomfort requiring sedation, and atelectasis may all be potential problems with a lung-protective strategy. However, the weight of evidence suggests that beneficial outcomes from lung-protective strategies outweigh any potential harm from these tradeoffs. Finally, properly performed weaning protocols based on clinical evidence should reduce any iatrogenic delays in ventilator weaning and thereby minimize prolongation of unneeded mechanical ventilatory support.

### Unravelling the complexity of ventilator-associated pneumonia: a systematic methodological literature review of diagnostic criteria and definitions used in clinical research [^114yR8pQ]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

This systematic review provides an overview of diagnostic criteria for VAP used in RCTs and the definitions attributed to the term "ventilator-associated". Our findings highlight the heterogeneity and lack of standardisation in commonly used diagnostic criteria, as well as the variability in definitions of "ventilator-associated" across clinical trials. We emphasise the need for a uniform definition of VAP to enable better comparability between studies and interventions. The results of this review will inform the work of an upcoming task force aimed at establishing such standardised criteria.

### Does the specific time of day used to capture data on ventilator-days have an impact on the documented rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia? [^114KtsqH]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2010). Low credibility.

Definitions of ventilator-associated pneumonia do not note a preferred daily time for obtaining denominator data. We examined collecting data on the number of ventilator-days at different times of day in 7 intensive care units. Rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia did not significantly differ when denominator data were collected at midnight, 8 am, or 4 pm, supporting standard definitions.

### Unravelling the complexity of ventilator-associated pneumonia: a systematic methodological literature review of diagnostic criteria and definitions used in clinical research [^115uEVqn]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a prevalent and grave hospital-acquired infection that affects mechanically ventilated patients. Diverse diagnostic criteria can significantly affect VAP research by complicating the identification and management of the condition, which may also impact clinical management.

Objectives

We conducted this review to assess the diagnostic criteria and the definitions of the term "ventilator-associated" used in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of VAP management.

Search Methods

Based on the protocol (PROSPERO 2019 CRD42019147411), we conducted a systematic search on MEDLINE/PubMed and Cochrane CENTRAL for RCTs, published or registered between 2010 and 2024.

Selection Criteria

We included completed and ongoing RCTs that assessed pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions in adults with VAP.

Data Collection and Synthesis

Data were collected using a tested extraction sheet, as endorsed by the Cochrane Collaboration. After cross-checking, data were summarised in a narrative and tabular form.

Results

In total, 7,173 records were identified through the literature search. Following the exclusion of records that did not meet the eligibility criteria, 119 studies were included. Diagnostic criteria were provided in 51.2% of studies, and the term "ventilator-associated" was defined in 52.1% of studies. The most frequently included diagnostic criteria were pulmonary infiltrates (96.7%), fever (86.9%), hypothermia (49.1%), sputum (70.5%), and hypoxia (32.8%). The different criteria were used in 38 combinations across studies. The term "ventilator-associated" was defined in nine different ways.

Conclusions

When provided, diagnostic criteria and definitions of VAP in RCTs display notable variability. Continuous efforts to harmonise VAP diagnostic criteria in future clinical trials are crucial to improve quality of care, enable accurate epidemiological assessments, and guide effective antimicrobial stewardship.

### Ventilator-associated pneumonia [^1169Xu7G]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a significant clinical infection affecting up to one-third of patients requiring mechanical ventilation, and is associated with significant attributable morbidity and mortality. Clinicians should have a heightened clinical suspicion for VAP with diagnostic goals focusing on accuracy; gathering of lower respiratory tract culture; and appropriate and timely initial antibiotic therapy. Early and adequate antibiotic therapy is important to optimize the management of patients with VAP. The incidence and etiologic patterns of the major pathogens causing VAP must be taken into account when making empiric antibiotic therapy choices. Subsequent de-escalation and prescription of an appropriate duration of therapy guided by clinical response and culture results may lead to decreased morbidity and future antibiotic resistance.

### Antibiotics for ventilator-associated pneumonia [^112hrKSv]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, complicating the medical course of approximately 10% of mechanically-ventilated patients, with an estimated attributable mortality of 13%. To treat VAP empirically, the American Thoracic Society currently recommends antibiotic therapy based on the patients' risk of colonisation by an organism with multidrug resistance. The selection of initial antibiotic therapy in VAP is important, as inappropriate initial antimicrobial treatment is associated with higher mortality and longer hospital stay in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. While guidelines exist for the antibiotic treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) from the American Thoracic Society and the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, there are many limitations in the quality of available evidence. This systematic review aimed to summarise the results of all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compare empirical antibiotic regimens for VAP.

Objectives

The primary objective of this review was to assess the effect of different empirical antimicrobial therapies on the survival and clinical cure of adult patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Secondary objectives included reporting the incidence of adverse events, new superinfections, length of hospital stay, and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay associated with these therapies.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, LILACS, CINAHL and Web of Science to December 2015; we searched ClinicalTrials.gov to September 2016.

Selection Criteria

Two review authors independently assessed RCTs comparing empirical antibiotic treatments of VAP in adult patients, where VAP was defined as new-onset pneumonia that developed more than 48 hours after endotracheal intubation. Physicians and researchers were not required to be blinded for inclusion in this review.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted study data. We pooled studies and analysed them in two ways. We examined monotherapy, or a single experimental antimicrobial drug, versus combination therapy, or multiple experimental antimicrobial drugs. We also examined carbapenem therapy versus non-carbapenem therapy.

Main Results

We included 12 studies with 3571 participants. All included studies examined the empiric use of one antimicrobial regimen versus another for the treatment of adults with VAP, but the particular drug regimens examined by each study varied. There was potential for bias because some studies did not report outcomes for all participants. All but one study reported sources of funding or author affiliations with pharmaceutical companies. We found no statistical difference in all-cause mortality between monotherapy and combination therapy (N = 4; odds ratio (OR) monotherapy versus combination 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73 to 1.30), clinical cure (N = 2; OR monotherapy versus combination 0.88, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.36), length of stay in ICU (mean difference (MD) 0.65, 95% CI 0.07 to 1.23) or adverse events (N = 2; OR monotherapy versus combination 0.93, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.26). We downgraded the quality of evidence for all-cause mortality, adverse events, and length of ICU stay to moderate for this comparison. We determined clinical cure for this comparison to be of very low-quality evidence. For our second comparison of combination therapy with optional adjunctives only one meta-analysis could be performed due to a lack of trials comparing the same antibiotic regimens. Two studies compared tigecycline versus imipenem-cilastatin for clinical cure in the clinically evaluable population and there was a statistically significant increase in clinical cure for imipenem-cilastatin (N = 2; OR tigecycline versus imipenem-cilastatin 0.44, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.84). Of importance, this effect was due to a single study. We found no statistical difference in all-cause mortality between carbapenem and non-carbapenem therapies (N = 1; OR carbapenem versus non-carbapenem 0.59, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.19) or adverse events (N = 3; OR carbapenem versus non-carbapenem 0.78, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.09), but we found that carbapenems are associated with a statistically significant increase in the clinical cure (N = 3; OR carbapenem versus non-carbapenem 1.53, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.12 for intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and N = 2; OR carbapenem versus non-carbapenem 2.29, 95% CI 1.19 to 4.43 for clinically evaluable patients analysis). For this comparison we downgraded the quality of evidence for mortality, and clinical cure (ITT and clinically evaluable populations) to moderate. We determined the quality of evidence for adverse events to be low.

Authors' Conclusions

We did not find a difference between monotherapy and combination therapy for the treatment of people with VAP. Since studies did not identify patients with increased risk for multidrug-resistant bacteria, these data may not be generalisable to all patient groups. However, this is the largest meta-analysis comparing monotherapy to multiple antibiotic therapies for VAP and contributes further evidence to the safety of using effective monotherapy for the empiric treatment of VAP. Due to lack of studies, we could not evaluate the best antibiotic choice for VAP, but carbapenems as a class may result in better clinical cure than other tested antibiotics.

Ventilator-associated events framework — scope relative to these guidelines: The panel acknowledges the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's new entities of ventilator-associated events to assist metrics assessing the quality of care for ventilated patients, but emphasizes that these definitions were designed for surveillance and quality improvement at the population level and not to aid bedside diagnosis and treatment decisions; therefore, the panel did not consider these definitions for these guidelines.

### Ventilator-associated pneumonia – the wrong quality measure for benchmarking [^1126YPG4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Legislators, payers, and quality-of-care advocates across the United States are considering requiring hospitals to report ventilator-associated pneumonia rates as a way to benchmark and reward quality of care. Accurate diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia, however, is notoriously difficult because several common complications of critical care can mimic the clinical appearance of ventilator-associated pneumonia. The challenge is compounded by substantial subjectivity inherent in the current surveillance definition. These sources of variability make ventilator-associated pneumonia rates difficult to acquire, interpret, and compare both within and among institutions. Ventilator-associated pneumonia should be excluded from compulsory reporting initiatives until we develop and validate more objective outcome measures that meaningfully reflect quality of care for ventilated patients.

Mechanical ventilation is essential for supporting critically ill patients but increases the risk of bacterial colonization resulting from instrumental, biological, and practice-related factors. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), a common complication, is linked to prolonged mechanical ventilation and poor outcomes. Although decades of research have emphasized prevention through care bundles and best practices, VAP remains a significant concern. This review highlights current evidence and emerging strategies for VAP prevention and management in 2024, with practical relevance for respiratory therapists caring for mechanically ventilated adult patients.

### Unravelling the complexity of ventilator-associated pneumonia: a systematic methodological literature review of diagnostic criteria and definitions used in clinical research [^113ktNqk]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Variations in the eligibility criteria applied to VAP can have a significant impact on systematic reviews and meta-analyses that assess different interventions, primarily due to the potential lack of comparability among the studied populations. Furthermore, the incidence of VAP may be underestimated when excessively strict diagnostic criteria are employed.

A recent systematic review conducted by Weiss et al. focused on inclusion and judgment criteria used in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on nosocomial pneumonia and found considerable heterogeneity. However, the authors only considered RCTs evaluating antimicrobial treatment as interventions, did not distinguish between hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and VAP, and did not evaluate definitions of the term "ventilator-associated".

The objective of this systematic review was to provide a concise overview of the diagnostic criteria for VAP recently used in RCTs, as well as the definitions attributed to the term "ventilator-associated". Its findings will provide valuable insights to a forthcoming task force, which aims to establish a uniform definition and diagnostic criteria for VAP in clinical trials. The task force will be made up of representatives from prominent international societies with an interest in VAP, as well as patient partners with lived experience. The harmonisation of the diagnostic criteria for VAP in upcoming clinical research are vital for enhancing patient care, enabling accurate epidemiological studies, and guiding successful antimicrobial stewardship programs.

### Suspected ventilator-associated respiratory infection in severely ill patients: a prospective observational study [^117Rqre9]. Critical Care (2013). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Suspicion of ventilator-associated respiratory infection based on clinical criteria is associated with iatrogenic immunosuppression in critically ill patients.

- Suspicion of ventilator-associated pneumonia or tracheobronchitis is equally associated with adverse clinical outcomes.

- We identified patient groups at high risk for adverse outcomes that can be targeted in future clinical trials on diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for ventilator-associated infections.

- Despite the current enthusiasm for a focus on ventilator-associated events as an outcome for hospital-acquired infections, VARIs remain important for identifying patients who might derive benefit from targeted diagnostic or therapeutic modalities.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) definitions — diagnostic scope and time thresholds: The panel states the existing definitions are clinically useful and generally accepted and did not consider amending them, and defines pneumonia as the presence of a new lung infiltrate plus clinical evidence of infection including new onset of fever, purulent sputum, leukocytosis, and decline in oxygenation, while recognizing there is no gold standard for diagnosing HAP or VAP. HAP is defined as a pneumonia not incubating at hospital admission and occurring 48 hours or more after admission, and VAP is defined as a pneumonia occurring > 48 hours after endotracheal intubation. In this document, HAP denotes pneumonia not associated with mechanical ventilation; thus, HAP and VAP are mutually exclusive events.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) timing and MDR risk — The presence of risk factors for multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens should take precedence over classifying pneumonia as early vs late onset, and timing should be interpreted alongside other risk factors and recent antibiotic exposure; overall, patients who develop VAP after > 5 days of hospitalization are at higher risk of MDR infection than those with earlier VAP.

### Effectiveness of a ventilator care bundle to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia at the PICU: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116YDFDi]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Ventilator-associated pneumonia is one of the most frequent hospital-acquired infections in mechanically ventilated children. We reviewed the literature on the effectiveness of ventilator care bundles in critically ill children.

Data Sources

Embase, Medline OvidSP, Web-of-Science, Cochrane Library, and PubMed were searched from January 1990 until April 2017.

Study Selection

Studies were included if they met the following criteria: 1) implementation of a ventilator care bundle in PICU setting; 2) quality improvement or multicomponent approach with the (primary) objective to lower the ventilator-associated pneumonia rate (expressed as ventilator-associated pneumonia episodes/1,000 ventilator days); and 3) made a comparison, for example, with or without ventilator care bundle, using an experimental randomized or nonrandomized study design, or an interrupted-times series. Exclusion criteria were (systematic) reviews, guidelines, descriptive studies, editorials, or poster publications.

Data Extraction

The following data were collected from each study: design, setting, patient characteristics (if available), number of ventilator-associated pneumonia per 1,000 ventilator days, ventilator-associated pneumonia definitions used, elements of the ventilator care bundle, and implementation strategy. Ambiguities about data extraction were resolved after discussion and consulting a third reviewer (M.N. E. I.) when necessary. We quantitatively pooled the results of individual studies, where suitable. The primary outcome, reduction in ventilator-associated pneumonia per 1,000 ventilator days, was expressed as an incidence risk ratio with a 95% CI. All data for meta-analysis were pooled by using a DerSimonian and Laird random effect model.

Data Synthesis

Eleven articles were included. The median ventilator-associated pneumonia incidence decreased from 9.8 (interquartile range, 5.8–18.5) per 1,000 ventilator days to 4.6 (interquartile range, 1.2–8.6) per 1,000 ventilator days after implementation of a ventilator care bundle. The meta-analysis showed that the implementation of a ventilator care bundle resulted in significantly reduced ventilator-associated pneumonia incidences (incidence risk ratio = 0.45; 95% CI, 0.33–0.60; p < 0.0001; I = 55%).

Conclusions

Implementation of a ventilator-associated pneumonia bundle has the potential to reduce the prevalence of ventilator-associated pneumonia in mechanically ventilated children.

### The microbiology of ventilator-associated pneumonia [^115MQd7u]. Respiratory Care (2005). Low credibility.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common complication of ventilatory support for patients with acute respiratory failure and is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and costs. Awareness of the microbiology of VAP is essential for selecting optimal antibiotic therapy and improving these outcomes. The specific microbial causes of VAP are many and varied. Most cases of VAP are caused by bacterial pathogens that normally colonize the oropharynx and gut, or that are acquired via transmission by health-care workers from environmental surfaces or from other patients. Common pathogens include Pseudomonas species and other highly resistant Gram-negative bacilli, staphylococci, the Enterobacteriaceae, streptococci, and Haemophilus species. Antibiotic-resistant pathogens such as Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter species and methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus are much more common after prior antibiotic treatment or prolonged hospitalization or mechanical ventilation, and when other risk factors are present. The bacterial pathogens responsible for VAP also vary depending on patient characteristics and in certain clinical circumstances, such as in acute respiratory distress syndrome or following tracheostomy, traumatic injuries, or burns. But these differences appear to be due primarily to the duration of mechanical ventilation and/or degree of prior antibiotic exposure of these patients. The causes of VAP can vary considerably by geographic location (even between units in the same hospital), emphasizing the importance of local epidemiological and microbiological data. Atypical bacteria, viruses, and fungi also have been implicated as causes of VAP, but these pathogens have not been studied systematically and their role is presently unclear. In conclusion, information about the microbiology of VAP serves to guide optimal antibiotic therapy. The risk of antibiotic-resistant pathogens can be estimated using simple clinical features and awareness of local microbiology patterns. The roles of atypical bacterial and nonbacterial pathogens in VAP are incompletely understood and should be investigated further.

Nosocomial pneumonia is the leading cause of mortality due to hospital-acquired infections. A thorough understanding of the most recent developments in evaluating and managing nosocomial pneumonia is critical for infection control professionals and hospital epidemiologists, given the incidence and cost of this important patient safety problem. We review the evidence on pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of both ventilator-associated and nonventilator-associated pneumonia. Key recommendations are then provided for diagnostic testing strategies, antibiotic selection, and treatment duration. We also summarize the most recent data on how to prevent hospital-acquired infection, in general, and nosocomial pneumonia, in particular.

### Ventilator-associated pneumonia: pathobiological heterogeneity and diagnostic challenges [^115dH7Pb]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a nosocomial infection of the lung parenchyma that occurs after 48 h of tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation –. Within the Intensive Care Unit (ICU), VAP is the most frequent nosocomial infection, impacting 20–36% of critically ill patients. Incidence rates vary, ranging from 2 to 16 episodes per 1000 ventilator days, and are influenced by factors such as diagnostic criteria, preventative measures, and patient and geographical variations –. Intubation is the primary risk factor, associated with more than 95% of pneumonis in the ICU; however, patients with reduced consciousness, trauma, older age and illness severity also have an increased risk –.

Reported mortality rates for VAP span a wide range (24–76%); however, attributing mortality solely to VAP is complex due to the severity of underlying illnesses and diagnostic heterogeneity within ICU populations. VAP can lead to the development of septic shock or acute respiratory distress syndrome if the treatment is delayed or inappropriate. VAP results in substantial antibiotic prescription pressure, accounting for half of all antibiotics used in the ICU –. However, the prolific use of antibiotic therapy contributes to a vicious cycle of increasing multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens and mortality. Treatment failure increases the risk of mortality and may occur in a third to two-thirds of VAP cases, with inappropriate antibiotic use the most common cause. VAP increases hospital length of stay by an average of four to nine days and healthcare costs by £9000 per patient. Despite preventative measures, there is a rising prevalence of MDR and persistently high mortality and healthcare costs associated with VAP. The pathobiological heterogeneity and diagnostic challenges associated with VAP remain of significant importance in global healthcare. In this review, we summarise the pathobiological heterogeneity and diagnostic challenges associated with VAP.

### Pneumonia: challenges in the definition, diagnosis, and management of disease [^1122AJi7]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Defining health care-associated pneumonia, which includes both hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), is problematic and controversial. Aspiration pneumonia is often included as a subtype of HAP but may be related to community-acquired aspiration events. Scoring systems exist and new surveillance guidelines have been implemented to make early recognition of pneumonia more precise and objective. Management and prevention should follow recommendations, including early empirical therapy, targeted therapy, and limited duration of treatment. Patients with trauma present a challenge to the diagnosis and management of pneumonia, because of increased risk for aspiration and underlying chest and pulmonary injury.

### Ventilator-associated events: epidemiology, risk factors, and prevention [^112mWKkS]. Infectious Disease Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shifted the focus of safety surveillance in mechanically ventilated patients from ventilator-associated pneumonia to ventilator-associated events in 2013 to increase the objectivity and reproducibility of surveillance and to encourage quality improvement programs to focus on preventing a broader array of complications. Ventilator-associated events are associated with a doubling of the risk of dying. Prospective studies have found that minimizing sedation, increasing spontaneous awakening and breathing trials, and conservative fluid management can decrease event rates and the duration of ventilation. Multifaceted interventions to enhance these practices can decrease ventilator-associated event rates.

### Unravelling the complexity of ventilator-associated pneumonia: a systematic methodological literature review of diagnostic criteria and definitions used in clinical research [^1121dSvz]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Summary of evidence

This systematic review provides a concise overview of the diagnostic criteria for VAP used in RCTs and the definitions attributed to the term "ventilator-associated". A total of 119 studies on VAP, published or registered between 2010 and 2024, were included, spanning a total of 21,289 patients. The majority of studies focused exclusively on VAP, while some also included other subtypes of pneumonia alongside VAP. Diagnostic criteria were provided in only 51.2% of the studies, and the term "ventilator-associated" was defined in only 52.1% of the studies. The most commonly utilised definition for "ventilator-associated" was "onset after > 48 h of mechanical ventilation", used by 82.3% of studies providing a definition.

In clinical practice, the diagnosis of VAP is often based on a combination of clinical signs, laboratory results, and imaging findings, yet these are not without their limitations. Our systematic review revealed considerable heterogeneity among diagnostic criteria for VAP in recent RCTs. Various combinations of specific criteria were employed to define VAP, leading to significant variability. Moreover, commonly used criteria were defined in different ways, with variations observed in the thresholds set for fever/hypothermia, as well as leucocytosis/leucopoenia.

### Systematic review of studies investigating ventilator associated pneumonia diagnostics in intensive care [^112B5x7T]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) refers to inflammation of the lung parenchyma caused by infectious agents acquired specifically while receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. VAP is a preventable nosocomial complication which potentially contributes to avoidable mortality and morbidity. Therefore, it is considered a clinically and epidemiologically important measure of the quality of care. It contributes to additional resource consumption, adding time and expense to an intensive care stay, accounting for a large proportion of all antibiotic prescriptions. VAP is considered to be responsible for an additional cost of approximately $40,000 per episode in the US and around £9000 in the UK. The contribution of an episode of VAP to mortality is difficult to definitively ascertain because of the high number and severity of confounders amongst the at-risk population. This attributable mortality has been reported from high to neutral or near-neutral.

Throughout recent decades investigators have not adopted a fixed set of criteria or a fixed definition for VAP. This lack of a reference standard has led to an inability to make comparisons across study sets and uncertainty about VAP incidence. The incidence of VAP varies widely in different studies depending on the diagnostic criteria used, type of intensive therapy unit (ITU), and patient population.

Existing literature reports that the incidence of VAP varies widely between 4.0% and 28.8% of the at-risk population, with an event rate between 1.4 and 16.5 per 1000 ventilator days. As VAP rates have become an important quality indicator, the Centre for Disease Control and the European Centre for Disease Control use their own precise case definitions to identify VAP events. Both definitions return similar VAP rates making them adequate for surveillance purposes and benchmarking of critical care units internationally. However, due to the lack of concordance between these two definitions, they do not make ideal reference standards, and further highlight the difficulty in achieving consensus in diagnosing VAP. Microbiological samples, especially quantitative culture of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), are considered to be integral to the diagnosis of VAP. However, a systematic review of diagnostic methods in 2008 found that microbiological methods did not contribute to the accuracy of diagnosis over clinical criteria and all respiratory sampling methods were equivalent. The continuing lack of an agreed reference standard hampers research into novel diagnostic methods. The aim of this review was to identify what reference standards have been used in diagnostic evaluation research for VAP.

### Risk factors and outcomes of ventilator-associated pneumonia: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^116iynBh]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) is a cornerstone of care for critically ill patients in the ICU. However, its prolonged use comes with risks, one of the most concerning being VAP — a hospital-acquired infection that typically develops after at least 48 h of MV. VAP is among the most common ICU-acquired infections, contributing to higher morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. Its Reported incidence varies widely, from 5 to 40%, depending on the setting and diagnostic criteria.

Globally, the estimated prevalence of VAP is approximately 15.6%, with incidence rates ranging from 8.0 to 28.8% among at-risk patients and event rates of 1.4 to 16.5 per 1,000 ventilator days. These variations reflect differences in diagnostic criteria, institutional prevention strategies, and regional healthcare conditions.

According to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the incidence of VAP has significantly decreased in medical and surgical ICU over the past 15 years. Despite this progress, preventing and managing VAP remains a major challenge. Standardised protocols, such as the Neumonía Zero initiative, have helped reduce VAP rates in many ICUs worldwide.

Several risk factors have been linked to a higher likelihood of developing VAP, including older age, male sex, prolonged MV duration, impaired consciousness, comorbidities, severe burns, and prior antibiotic use. However, findings across studies are often inconsistent, especially in different patient populations and ICU settings, including neonatal and specialised units. Research into VAP risk factors in adults is ongoing.

VAP is also associated with worse clinical outcomes, such as longer MV duration, extended hospital stays, and increased mortality — especially in cases involving Gram-negative bacilli. While some multicentre prospective studies report high mortality rates linked to VAP, others have found no significant difference, highlighting the need for further research.

### Ventilator-associated events: what they are and what they are not [^1122E7BS]. Respiratory Care (2019). Medium credibility.

In 2013, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention redefined surveillance for quality of care in ventilated patients by shifting from ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) definitions to ventilator-associated event (VAE) definitions. VAE definitions were designed to overcome many of the limitations of VAP definitions, including their complexity, subjectivity, limited correlation with outcomes, and incomplete capture of many important and morbid complications of mechanical ventilation. VAE definitions broadened the focus of surveillance from pneumonia alone to the syndrome of nosocomial complications in ventilated patients, as marked by sustained increases in ventilator settings after a period of stable or decreasing ventilator settings. Qualitative studies suggest that most VAEs are caused by pneumonia, fluid overload, ARDS, and atelectasis. Only about 40% of clinically diagnosed VAPs meet VAE criteria, likely because the VAE requirement for a sustained increase in ventilator settings sets a threshold effect that selects for patients with severe disease. VAEs are associated with a doubling of the risk of death compared to patients without VAEs and compared to patients who meet traditional VAP criteria. Risk factors for VAEs include sedation with benzodiazepines or propofol, volume overload, high tidal-volume ventilation, high inspiratory driving pressures, oral care with chlorhexidine, blood transfusions, stress ulcer prophylaxis, and patient transport. Potential strategies to prevent VAEs include minimizing sedation, paired daily spontaneous awakening and breathing trials, early mobility, conservative fluid management, conservative transfusion thresholds, and low tidal-volume ventilation. A limited number of studies that have tested subsets of these interventions have reported substantial decreases in VAEs; no group, however, has thus far assessed the impact of a fully optimized VAE prevention bundle that includes all of these interventions upon VAE rates and other outcomes.

### Improving ventilator-associated event surveillance in the national healthcare safety network and addressing knowledge gaps: update and review [^115NMq2x]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently transitioned from ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) surveillance to ventilator-associated event (VAE) surveillance in adult inpatient settings. Since the transition, several modifications have been made to improve surveillance methods, and there is a growing body of data regarding the epidemiology, risk factors, and preventability of VAEs.

Recent Findings

The VAE surveillance definition algorithm is based on objective criteria and includes three tiers: ventilator-associated conditions, infection-related ventilator-associated complications, and possible and probable VAP. VAE surveillance expands the purview of surveillance beyond pneumonia alone to include additional complications of mechanical ventilation. Most VAEs are caused by pneumonia, pulmonary edema, atelectasis, or acute respiratory distress syndrome. VAEs are associated with adverse outcomes including prolonged mechanical ventilation, longer intensive care and hospital length-of-stay, and higher mortality rates. Studies to date suggest that minimizing sedation and optimizing fluid management can reduce VAE rates.

Summary

We review the CDC's recent updates on VAE surveillance definitions, methods, and tools, and provide an overview of the growing evidence base for VAE as a patient safety measure. Further work is needed to affirm and extend the current knowledge about how best to prevent VAEs.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) — 2016 executive summary states that the term HAP "denotes an episode of pneumonia not associated with mechanical ventilation", and that patients with HAP and VAP "belong to 2 distinct groups". Compared with 2005, changes include use of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, removal of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), and "the recommendation that each hospital generate antibiograms to guide healthcare professionals with respect to the optimal choice of antibiotics". To minimize unnecessary antibiotics and resistance, the panel states "we recommend that the antibiogram data be utilized to decrease the unnecessary use of dual gram-negative and empiric methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) antibiotic treatment", and "We also recommend short-course antibiotic therapy for most patients with HAP or VAP independent of microbial etiology, as well as antibiotic de-escalation".

### Hospital-acquired pneumonia, health care-associated pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis: definitions and challenges in trial design [^112GEen3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Clinical trials of nosocomial pneumonia can include patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and health care-associated pneumonia. All study participants should meet a clinical definition of infection and have some microbiologic confirmation of infection and its etiology. If the trial is to reflect clinical practice and to be practical to conduct, insistence that all patients have bronchoscopic quantitative cultures performed may not be practical. In designing a clinical trial, patients treated in the intensive care unit are the best group to target for study, including only those with severe pneumonia but allowing those with both ventilator-associated pneumonia and hospital-acquired pneumonia to be enrolled. All trials should include a protocol to control for standards of care, including timing of initial therapy, recent antibiotic use, local microbiology patterns, duration of therapy, and the use of a de-escalation therapy strategy. Blinding of a trial may not be required if studying a new agent that is more active against multidrug-resistant pathogens than against currently available comparators. Any new agent should meet a noninferiority end point for 30-day mortality, but if superiority is a goal of trial design, end points could be microbiologic eradication, time to microbiologic eradication, prolonged duration of therapy, need to modify initial therapy, and serial evaluation of the arterial oxygen tension to fractional inspired oxygen ratio.

### Diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia: controversies and working toward a gold standard [^113emMxa]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The aim is to discuss the clinical, microbiologic, and radiological criteria used in the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), distinguish between ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) and VAP, and reconcile the proposed Centers for Disease Control surveillance criteria with clinical practice.

Recent Findings

Numerous ventilator-associated complications (VACs), including VAP and VAT, may occur in critically ill, intubated patients. A variety of definitions for identifying VAP have been proposed, but there is no diagnostic gold standard. The proposed surveillance definition will identify infectious and noninfectious VAC, including VAP and VAT, but this definition may be inadequate for clinical practice.

Summary

The clinical characteristics of VAP and VAT are similar and include fever, leukocytosis, and purulent sputum. An infiltrate on chest radiograph is consistent with VAP but lacks diagnostic precision, so it is not a criterion in the proposed surveillance definition and should be interpreted cautiously by clinicians. Microbiologically, quantitative and semiquantitative endotracheal aspirate cultures may be employed to diagnose VAP and VAT. Positive bronchoalveolar lavage and protected specimen brush cultures are useful only for the diagnosis of VAP. Experts should collaborate to develop consensus definitions for VAP and VAT that can be applied in practice.

### Ventilator-associated pneumonia or not? Contemporary diagnosis [^113pfrX7]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is pneumonia in patients who have been on mechanical ventilation for ≥ 48 hours. VAP is most accurately diagnosed by quantitative culture and microscopy examination of lower respiratory tract secretions, which are best obtained by bronchoscopically directed techniques such as the protected specimen brush and bronchoalveolar lavage. These techniques have acceptable repeatability, and interpretation of results is unaffected by antibiotics administered concurrently for infection at extrapulmonary sites as long as antimicrobial therapy has not been changed for < 72 hours before bronchoscopy.

### Risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia: from epidemiology to patient management [^116V1mtx]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

Risk factors for the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), as identified in epidemiological studies, have provided a basis for testable interventions in randomized trials. We describe how these results have influenced patient treatment. Single interventions in patients undergoing intubation have focused on either reducing aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions, modulation of colonization (in either the oropharynx, the stomach, or the whole digestive tract), use of systemic antimicrobial prophylaxis, or ventilator circuit changes. More recently, multiple simultaneously implemented interventions have been used. In general, routine measures to decrease oropharyngeal aspiration and antibiotic-containing prevention strategies appear to be the most effective, and the latter were associated with improved rates of patient survival in recent trials. These benefits must be balanced against the widespread fear of emergence of antibiotic resistance. In hospital settings with low baseline levels of antibiotic resistance, however, the benefits to patient outcome may outweigh this fear of resistance. In settings with high levels of antibiotic resistance, combined approaches of non-antibiotic using strategies and education programs might be most beneficial.

### A multicentered prospective analysis of diagnosis, risk factors, and outcomes associated with pediatric ventilator-associated pneumonia [^112Y4deX]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess risk factors and outcomes associated with pediatric ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Design

Multicentered prospective observational cohort.

Setting

Children's hospitals in the United States.

Patients

Mechanically ventilated patients less than 18 years old.

Measurements and Main Results

Prospective evaluation of the prevalence, risk factors, and outcomes of pediatric ventilator-associated pneumonia along with evaluation of diagnostic criterion for pediatric ventilator-associated pneumonia. The prevalence of pediatric ventilator-associated pneumonia was 5.2% (n = 2,082), for a rate of 7.1/1,000 ventilator days. Patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia had a longer unadjusted ICU length of stay (p < 0.0001) and increased length of mechanical ventilation by more than 11 days (p < 0.0001). After adjustment for patient factors, ICU length of stay (p = 0.03) and mechanical ventilation days (p = 0.001) remained significant. Patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia were almost three times more likely to die (p = 0.007). Independent risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia were reintubation and part-time ventilation.

Conclusions

Pediatric ventilator-associated pneumonia is common in mechanically ventilated pediatric patients. These patients have longer length of stay, longer duration of mechanical ventilation, and increased risk for mortality.

Additional approaches for preventing VAP and/or ventilator-associated events (VAE) note that these are interventions associated with lower VAP rates that may also decrease VAE rates, duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and/or mortality but carry some risk of harm; they also include interventions associated with lower VAE rates with insufficient data to determine impact on objective outcomes, and hospitals can consider adopting these approaches if VAP or VAE rates do not improve despite high performance with essential practices; some interventions may decrease duration of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and/or mortality in some populations but not in others and may confer some risk of harm in some populations.

### The ventilator circuit and ventilator-associated pneumonia [^113DUoKb]. Respiratory Care (2005). Low credibility.

Historically, the relationship between the ventilator circuit and pulmonary infection was accepted as fact, without any scientific evidence. Hence the term, "ventilator"-associated pneumonia. Recent evidence, however, has demonstrated that the major sources of pneumonia in the ventilated patient are colonization of the gastrointestinal tract, with subsequent aspiration around the endotracheal tube cuff, and contamination by caregivers. In recent years, the relationship of respiratory care equipment to ventilator-associated pneumonia has been studied carefully. A number of clinical trials have demonstrated that routine changing of the ventilator circuit fails to impact the incidence of pneumonia in the ventilated patient. Additional studies evaluating the type of humidification device, type of suctioning device, and frequency of change of the devices have resulted in conflicting evidence. This paper reviews the role of the humidifier, ventilator circuit, and airway suctioning equipment on the pathogenesis and prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) scope decision — panel rationale and conclusion: The panel notes that patients with HCAP were thought to be at high risk for multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms due to healthcare contact, but reports that the rationales for including HCAP with the hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)/ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) recommendations have come into question, with increasing evidence that many HCAP patients are not at high risk for MDR pathogens and that underlying patient characteristics are also important independent determinants of risk. Consequently, the panel unanimously decided that HCAP should not be included in the HAP/VAP guidelines, anticipating that recommendations for community-dwelling patients would likely be based on validated risk factors for MDR pathogens and not solely on previous healthcare contact.

Section 3: Background on prevention of VAP, VAE, and NV-HAP

Framework for evaluating and prioritizing interventions

The subjectivity and lack of specificity of diagnosing pneumonia complicate the interpretation of VAP and NV-HAP prevention studies. Subjectivity makes it possible that decreases in observed pneumonia rates are due to stricter interpretation of subjective diagnostic criteria rather than true decreases in disease. Lack of specificity makes it possible that lower pneumonia rates are due to less colonization or decreases in conditions that mimic the presentation of pneumonia without corresponding decreases in true pneumonia cases.
VAE criteria are more objective and hence less susceptible to these sources of bias, but the literature on VAE prevention is still relatively sparse.
Given the limitations of the pneumonia prevention literature and the relative paucity of VAE prevention literature, we prioritize pneumonia prevention strategies associated with improvements in objective outcomes such as duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU or hospital length of stay, mortality, VAEs, antibiotic utilization, and/or costs in randomized controlled trials. In addition, the potential benefits of different interventions are balanced against their feasibility, costs, and potential harms.

### Prediction models for the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients on mechanical ventilation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111kf9Mq]. American Journal of Infection Control (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Identifying patients at risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia through prediction models can facilitate medical decision-making. Our objective was to evaluate the current models for ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients with mechanical ventilation.

Methods

Nine databases systematically retrieved from establishment to March 6, 2024. Two independent reviewers performed study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment, respectively. The Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool was used to evaluate the risk of model bias and applicability. Stata 17.0 was used to conduct a meta-analysis of discrimination of model validation.

Results

The total of 34 studies were included, with reported 52 prediction models. The most frequent predictors in the models were mechanical ventilation duration, length of intensive care unit stay, and age. Each study was essentially considered having a high risk of bias. A meta-analysis of 17 studies containing 33 models with validation was performed with a pooled area under the receiver-operating curve of 0.80 (95% confidence interval: 0.78–0.83).

Conclusions

Despite the relatively excellent performance of the models, there is a high risk of bias of the model development process. Enhancing the methodological quality, especially the external validation, practical application, and optimization of the models need urgent attention.

### Biomarker-guided antibiotic stewardship in suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAPrapid2): a randomised controlled trial and process evaluation [^112A2k9o]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Ventilator-associated pneumonia is the most common infection acquired in intensive care units (ICUs), and is associated with substantial mortality, particularly in the ageing ICU population. Broad-spectrum antibiotic use is recommended in suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia. However, diagnosis of this infection remains notoriously difficult, and pulmonary infection is typically confirmed in only 20–60% of suspected cases. Consequently, antibiotics are overused for suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia, potentially exposing patients to adverse effects, detracting from alternative causes of respiratory compromise, increasing costs, and driving emergence of antimicrobial resistance.

Point prevalence studies suggest that 70% of patients in the ICU receive antibiotics. The association between increased antibiotic use and emergence of antimicrobial resistance in ICUs is well established. In the setting of hospital-acquired pneumonia, adherence to guidelines that promote broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics has been associated with adverse outcomes. This background has driven a need to rationalise antibiotic prescribing in ICUs.

Rapid diagnostic tests with the capacity to rule out ventilator-associated pneumonia might present early opportunities to optimise antibiotic prescription and decrease antibiotic use. Among protein-based biomarkers, only a combination of low IL-1β and IL-8 concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid has been validated in a multicentre setting in suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia.

The VAPrapid2 trial aimed to determine whether measurement of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid IL-1β and IL-8 could improve antibiotic stewardship without compromising patient safety in suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia. In keeping with expert guidance on analysis of complex interventions, a process evaluation study was embedded in this trial.

### Unravelling the complexity of ventilator-associated pneumonia: a systematic methodological literature review of diagnostic criteria and definitions used in clinical research [^116TJk1W]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

Protocol and registration

The protocol for this systematic review was registered in advance with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO 2019 CRD42019147411), encompassing a broad review focusing on pneumonia outcomes and diagnostic criteria in RCTs. Recognising the limitations of discussing all findings in one manuscript, we opted to produce several focused and comprehensive manuscripts, all employing the same fundamental methodology, as registered with PROSPERO. While a previous publication focused on outcomes reported in RCTs on pneumonia management, the current submission specifically addresses diagnostic criteria for VAP.

Eligibility criteria

We included RCTs that were registered, planned, and/or completed that: (1) enrolled adults with VAP; and (2) assessed the safety, efficacy and/or effectiveness of pharmacological or non-pharmacological interventions for treating VAP.

We have excluded systematic reviews, meta-analyses, narrative reviews, post hoc analyses from RCTs, observational studies, case reports, editorials, conference proceedings, and studies that do not exclusively focus on pneumonia (such as trials including patients with pneumonia alongside other diseases). Additionally, studies on pneumonia subtypes other than VAP, such as pneumonia without specifying a subtype, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP), and HAP, have also been excluded. To maintain focus and relevance, studies on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) were excluded from this systematic review, as the viral aetiology and distinct clinical management protocols differ significantly from the nature and treatment strategies of VAP. RCT protocols were only included if the results have not been previously published in another article included in this systematic review. Due to resource constraints and the lack of multilingual expertise within the review team, this systematic review was restricted to English-language RCTs.

Information sources and search

On 20 May 2024, we searched MEDLINE/PubMed, and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) for RCTs published between 1 January 2010 and 19 May 2024. We used electronic algorithms introducing a combination of controlled vocabulary and search terms as reported in the Appendix.

Study selection

Two reviewers (FH, MF) independently screened titles and abstracts to identify eligible studies using Rayyan. In case of disagreement, a third reviewer was consulted (AGM). After immediate exclusion of duplicates using EndNote X9, four reviewers (AGM, FH, JH, MF) independently checked for eligibility at full-text level. The results of the selection process are reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA).

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) — empiric gram-negative coverage and number of anti-Pseudomonas agents: The evidence indicated that approximately 35% of HAP cases are caused by gram-negative bacilli, and the panel agreed this dictates that all empiric regimens target P. aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli; the recommendation is strong despite the very low quality of evidence. Regarding whether to use one or 2 antibiotics with activity against P. aeruginosa, the panel concluded that HAP patients with factors increasing the likelihood of gram-negative infection, including Pseudomonas, or increased risk for mortality should receive antibiotics from 2 different classes with activity against P. aeruginosa, whereas patients without these factors should receive only one such antibiotic. A high risk for mortality was defined as requiring ventilatory support due to pneumonia and having septic shock.

### Healthcare epidemiology: ventilator-associated pneumonia: preventing the inevitable [^117LPUh8]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Ventilator-associate pneumonia (VAP) is the most common nosocomial infection in patients in intensive care units (ICU). Because of its association with unwanted clinical outcomes, preventive measures have been studied intensively in the past 25 years. Unfortunately, a large amount of clinical trials yielded disappointingly few clear-cut answers. Furthermore, because of the difficulties in reliably diagnosing VAP, we should be very reluctant in embracing measures that have been associated with VAP reductions in small-sized studies, but with no benefits on patient outcome documented in sufficiently powered well-designed trials. Only topical antimicrobial prophylaxis (either alone in the oropharynx or in combination with intestinal decontamination) has been demonstrated to improve patient outcome resulting from prevention of VAP. However, this was demonstrated in not-so-average circumstances-in ICUs with extremely low levels of antibiotic resistance. Despite the obvious challenges with using antibiotics as preventive measures, careful evaluation of these strategies in settings with higher drug-resistance levels is now justified, and future studies should be designed to demonstrate outcome benefits rather than reductions in VAP rates.

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) empiric therapy — MRSA risk and agents: We suggest including an agent active against MRSA for the empiric treatment of suspected VAP only in patients with any of the following: a risk factor for antimicrobial resistance (Table 2), patients being treated in units where > 10%–20% of S. aureus isolates are methicillin resistant, and patients in units where the prevalence of MRSA is not known (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). If empiric coverage for MRSA is indicated, we recommend either vancomycin or linezolid (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### When policy gets it right: variability in U.S. hospitals' diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia* [^111o9yDM]. Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

The Centers for Disease Control has recently proposed a major change in how ventilator-associated pneumonia is defined. This has profound implications for public reporting, reimbursement, and accountability measures for ICUs. We sought to provide evidence for or against this change by quantifying limitations of the national definition of ventilator-associated pneumonia that was in place until January 2013, particularly with regard to comparisons between, and ranking of, hospitals and ICUs.

Design

A prospective survey of a nationally representative group of 43 hospitals, randomly selected from the American Hospital Association Guide (2009). Subjects classified six standardized vignettes of possible cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia as pneumonia or no pneumonia.

Subjects

Individuals responsible for ventilator-associated pneumonia surveillance at 43 U.S. hospitals.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

We measured the proportion of standardized cases classified as ventilator-associated pneumonia. Of 138 hospitals consented, 61 partially completed the survey and 43 fully completed the survey (response rate 44% and 31%, respectively). Agreement among hospitals about classification of cases as ventilator-associated pneumonia/not ventilator-associated pneumonia was nearly random (Fleiss κ 0.13). Some hospitals rated 0% of cases as having pneumonia; others classified 100% as having pneumonia (median, 50%; interquartile range, 33–66%). Although region of the country did not predict case assignment, respondents who described their region as "rural" were more likely to judge a case to be pneumonia than respondents elsewhere (relative risk, 1.25, Kruskal-Wallis chi-square, p = 0.03).

Conclusions

In this nationally representative study of hospitals, assignment of ventilator-associated pneumonia is extremely variable, enough to render comparisons between hospitals worthless, even when standardized cases eliminate variability in clinical data abstraction. The magnitude of this variability highlights the limitations of using poorly performing surveillance definitions as methods of hospital evaluation and comparison, and our study provides very strong support for moving to a more objective definition of ventilator-associated complications.

### Objective surveillance definitions for ventilator-associated pneumonia [^1153ba2J]. Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

The subjectivity and complexity of surveillance definitions for ventilator-associated pneumonia preclude meaningful internal or external benchmarking and therefore hamper quality improvement initiatives for ventilated patients. We explored the feasibility of creating objective surveillance definitions for ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Design

We identified clinical signs suitable for inclusion in objective definitions, proposed candidate definitions incorporating these objective signs, and then applied these definitions to retrospective clinical data to measure their frequencies and associations with adverse outcomes using multivariate regression models for cases and matched controls.

Setting

Medical and surgical intensive care units in eight U.S. hospitals (four tertiary centers, three community hospitals, and one Veterans Affairs institution).

Patients

Eight thousand seven hundred thirty-five consecutive episodes of mechanical ventilation for adult patients.

Interventions

We evaluated 32 different candidate definitions composed of different combinations of the following signs: three thresholds for respiratory deterioration defined by sustained increases in daily minimum positive end-expiratory pressure or FIO2 after either 2 or 3 days of stable or decreasing ventilator settings, abnormal temperature, abnormal white blood cell count, purulent pulmonary secretions defined by neutrophils on Gram stain, and positive cultures for pathogenic organisms.

Measurements and Main Results

Ventilator-associated pneumonia incidence, attributable ventilator days, hospital days, and hospital mortality. All candidate definitions were significantly associated with increased ventilator days and hospital days, but only definitions requiring objective evidence of respiratory deterioration were significantly associated with increased hospital mortality. Significant odds ratios for hospital mortality ranged from 1.9 (95% confidence interval 1.2–2.9) to 6.1 (95% confidence interval 2.2–17). Requiring additional clinical signs beyond respiratory deterioration alone decreased event rates, had little impact on attributable lengths of stay, and diminished sensitivity and positive predictive values for hospital mortality.

Conclusions

Objective surveillance definitions that include quantitative evidence of respiratory deterioration after a period of stability strongly predict increased length of stay and hospital mortality. These definitions merit further evaluation of their utility for hospital quality and safety improvement programs.

### Risk factors and outcomes of ventilator-associated pneumonia: an updated systematic review and meta-analysis [^112tx1cL]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Search strategy

Two investigators (PO, HMPG) independently conducted systematic Literature searches of PubMed, Cochrane Database, Scopus, Medline Ovid, Science Direct, and Epistemonikos databases, published from inception to November 2024. Discrepancies between the investigators were resolved with the intervention of a third investigator (DMF), and manual searches were conducted by selecting reference lists of the articles included. The terms "ventilator associated pneumonia", "intensive care units", "risk factors", "patient outcome assessment", and articles in all languages were included; the full search strategy is described in Additional files 1.

Inclusion criteria

The inclusion criteria for our study were as follows: all patients who had been on mechanical ventilation for More than 48 h were included; articles had to provide a clear operational definition and a diagnosis of VAP; articles had to report on risk factors or outcomes of VAP; studies had to be cohort, cross-sectional, or case-control; and the full text had to be available.

Exclusion criteria

Systematic reviews, those whose unit of analysis was not the patient, case reports, editorials, correspondence, studies of patients without VAP.

Statistical analysis

Review Manager Software (RevMan5.3; Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK) was used to perform a meta-analysis of VAP risk factors and outcomes in VAP patients. Mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated to compare the continuous variables. For count data, odds ratios (OR) and 95% CI were used. They were considered significantly associated with VAP when p < 0.05. Heterogeneity, calculated using the I² statistic, was considered to exist if I² > 50%. Random-effects models were used for the meta-analysis. A subgroup analysis was conducted to identify sources of heterogeneity in clinical outcomes, considering age (> 60 years), study type, and methodological quality assessed with the NOS scale. Other subgroup analyses were performed for risk factors based on the nature of the study (prospective, retrospective, multicentre, and single-centre) and according to the diagnostic criteria for VAP. A sensitivity analysis was conducted by removing outliers for risk factors, and finally, a bivariate meta-regression analysis was carried out. Publication bias was assessed using a funnel plot and Egger's test with Stata 18.

Strengths of the study

Our study also has several strengths. Firstly, the number of studies included in the meta-analysis provides a broad and representative basis for the analysis. Secondly, the large number of patients studied enhances the robustness and generalisability of the results. Thirdly, the examination of a wide range of risk factors and clinical outcomes offers a comprehensive understanding of VAP. Additionally, the subgroup analyses and sensitivity analysis increase the study's methodological rigour. Finally, the careful formulation of the search strategies, study selection, and data entry and analysis ensures the accuracy and reliability of the findings.

Implications for clinical practice

This study has important implications for clinical practice, particularly in distinguishing modifiable from non-modifiable risk factors for VAP. While non-modifiable factors such as sex or underlying comorbidities support risk stratification and closer surveillance, modifiable factors — including reintubation, tracheostomy, sedation practices, and enteral nutrition strategies — represent actionable targets for prevention. Addressing these factors through evidence-based bundles and multidisciplinary protocols can reduce the incidence of VAP and improve patient outcomes. Recognising these risks is crucial not only for reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU stay, and hospitalisation, but also for enhancing overall recovery and quality of care in critically ill patients.

Future directions

Future research should focus on standardising the diagnostic criteria for VAP, assessing the interaction between risk factors and co-interventions, and exploring the role of emerging technologies to monitor and prevent complications associated with mechanical ventilation. In addition, well-designed, prospective multicentre studies are needed to clarify the true contribution of controversial factors, such as enteral nutrition and prior antibiotic exposure, to the development of VAP.

### Descriptive epidemiology and outcomes of nonventilated hospital-acquired, ventilated hospital-acquired, and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia in the United States, 2012–2019 [^111Gpxq4]. Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

OBJECTIVES:

Multiple randomized controlled trials exploring the outcomes of patients with ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia and hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia have noted that hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia patients who require subsequent ventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia suffered higher mortality than either those who did not (nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia) or had ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia. We examined the epidemiology and outcomes of all three conditions in a large U.S. database.

DESIGN:

Retrospective cohort.

SETTING:

Two hundred fifty-three acute-care hospitals, United States, contributing data (including microbiology) to Premier database, 2012–2019.

PATIENTS:

Patients with hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia or ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia identified based on a slightly modified previously published International Classification of Diseases, 9th Edition/ International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition-Clinical Modification algorithm.

INTERVENTIONS:

None.

MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS:

Among 17,819 patients who met enrollment criteria, 26.5% had nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia, 25.6% vHAPB, and 47.9% ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia. Ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia predominated in the Northeastern United States and in large urban teaching hospitals. Patients with nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia were oldest (mean 66.7 ± 15.1 yr) and most likely White (76.9%), whereas those with ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia were youngest (59.7 ± 16.6 yr) and least likely White (70.3%). Ventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia was associated with the highest comorbidity burden (mean Charlson score 4.1 ± 2.8) and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia with the lowest (3.2 ± 2.5). Similarly, hospital mortality was highest among patients with ventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (29.2%) and lowest in nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (11.7%), with ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia in-between (21.3%). Among survivors, 24.5% of nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia required a rehospitalization within 30 days of discharge, compared with 22.5% among ventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and 18.8% ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia. Unadjusted hospital length of stay after infection onset was longest among ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia and shortest among nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia patients. Median total hospital costs mirrored length of stay: ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia $77,657, ventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia $62,464, and nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia $39,911.

CONCLUSIONS:

Both hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia remain associated with significant mortality and cost in the United States. Our analyses confirm that of all three conditions, ventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia carries the highest risk of death. In contrast, ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia remains most costly. Nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia survivors were most likely to require a readmission within 30 days of discharge.

### The challenge of ventilator-associated pneumonia diagnosis in COVID-19 patients [^115KoBrm]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

While different phenotypes have been evidenced in ICU COVID-19 pneumonia, most patients meet ARDS Berlin definition associating bilateral radiologic infiltrates with severe hypoxemia. COVID-19 patients frequently require prolonged invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) including prone positioning, heavy sedation, and muscle blockers for several weeks. In addition, there is clear evidence of prolonged immunosuppression including deep lymphopenia. This accounts for a high risk of secondary hospital-acquired infections, primarily ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The diagnosis of ventilator-associated infections remains challenging due to major definition heterogeneity of multiple clinical entities, and no consensus has yet been reached on appropriate diagnostic strategies for VAP. Irrespective of the definition, accurate diagnosis of VAP requires clinical signs of infection, microbiological documentation, and chest X-ray findings, even if the latter may be difficult to interpret due to preexisting parenchymal injury.

Much progress has been made in the understanding of nosocomial pneumonia but important issues in diagnosis and treatment remain unresolved. The controversy over diagnostic tools should be closed. Instead, every effort should be made to increase our ability to make valid clinical predictions about the presence of ventilator associated pneumonia and to establish criteria to guide restricting empirical antimicrobial treatment without causing patient harm. More emphasis must be put on local infection control measures such as routine surveillance of pathogens, definition of controlled policies of antimicrobial treatment, and effective implementation of strategies of prevention.

### Incidence and risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia in a developing country: where is the difference? [^11359Hbi]. Respiratory Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Latin America exhibits a wide range of differences, compared to developed nations, in genetic background, health services, and clinical research development. It is valid to hypothesize that the incidence and risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in our setting may be substantially different of those reported elsewhere. We conducted a study to determine the incidence and risk factors for VAP in a University Hospital from Medellin, Colombia.

Methods

Prospective cohort study in three intensive care units (ICU) (surgical/trauma, medical, cardiovascular) in a 550-bed University Hospital. Critically ill patients (n = 270) who required at least 48 h of mechanical ventilation (MV) between June 2002 and October 2003 were followed until ICU discharge, VAP diagnosis or death.

Results

Sixty patients (22.2%) developed VAP 5.9 ± 3.6 days after admission. The overall incidence of VAP was 29 cases per 1000 ventilator-days. The daily hazard for developing VAP increased until day 8, and then decreased over the duration of stay in the ICU. The only statistically significant factor after multivariable analysis was gender, with being female reducing 57% the risk of pneumonia (hazard ratios (HR): 0.43; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.19–0.96).

Conclusions

The epidemiologic profile of VAP in terms of incidence, length of stay and clinical course resembles the general pattern described everywhere. Surprisingly, we could not identify any potentially modifiable risk factor for VAP. A comprehensive multicenter study is warranted. It should provide deep insight about the specific microbiological, genetic and clinic features of VAP in our setting.

### Global prospective epidemiologic and surveillance study of ventilator-associated pneumonia due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa [^1153ttZd]. Critical Care Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the prevalence of ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients at risk for ventilator-associated pneumonia and to describe risk factors for P. aeruginosa ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Design

Prospective, observational study.

Setting

ICUs at 56 sites in 11 countries across four regions: the United States (n = 502 patients), Europe (n = 495), Latin America (n = 500), and Asia Pacific (n = 376).

Patients

Adults intubated and mechanically ventilated for 48 hours to 7 days, inclusive.

Interventions

None (local standard of care).

Measurements and Main Results

Ventilator-associated pneumonia prevalence as defined by local investigators were 15.6% (293/1,873) globally, 13.5% in the United States, 19.4% in Europe, 13.8% in Latin America, and 16.0% in Asia Pacific (p = 0.04). Corresponding P. aeruginosa ventilator-associated pneumonia prevalences were 4.1%, 3.4%, 4.8%, 4.6%, and 3.2% (p = 0.49). Of 50 patients with P. aeruginosa ventilator-associated pneumonia who underwent surveillance testing, 19 (38%) had prior P. aeruginosa colonization and 31 (62%) did not (odds ratio, 7.99; 95% CI, 4.31–14.71). Of predefined risk factors for multidrug resistance (hereafter, risk factors), the most frequent in all patients were antimicrobial therapy within 90 days (51.9% of enrolled patients) and current hospitalization of more than or equal to 5 days (45.3%). None of these risk factors were significantly associated with P. aeruginosa ventilator-associated pneumonia by multivariate logistic regression. Risk factors associated with prior P. aeruginosa colonization were antimicrobial therapy within 90 days (odds ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.29–0.73) and high proportion of antibiotic resistance in the community or hospital unit (odds ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.14–2.82).

Conclusions

Our findings suggest that ventilator-associated pneumonia remains a common ICU infection and that P. aeruginosa is one of the most common causative pathogens. The odds of developing P. aeruginosa ventilator-associated pneumonia were eight times higher in patients with prior P. aeruginosa colonization than in uncolonized patients, which in turn was associated with local resistance.

### Descriptive epidemiology and outcomes of nonventilated hospital-acquired, ventilated hospital-acquired, and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia in the United States, 2012–2019 [^112gc3tA]. Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Multiple randomized controlled trials exploring the outcomes of patients with ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia and hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia have noted that hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia patients who require subsequent ventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia suffered higher mortality than either those who did not (nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia) or had ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia. We examined the epidemiology and outcomes of all three conditions in a large U.S. database.

Design

Retrospective cohort.

Setting

Two hundred fifty-three acute-care hospitals, United States, contributing data (including microbiology) to Premier database, 2012–2019.

Patients

Patients with hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia or ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia identified based on a slightly modified previously published International Classification of Diseases, 9th Edition/International Classification of Diseases, 10th Edition-Clinical Modification algorithm.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Among 17,819 patients who met enrollment criteria, 26.5% had nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia, 25.6% vHAPB, and 47.9% ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia. Ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia predominated in the Northeastern United States and in large urban teaching hospitals. Patients with nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia were oldest (mean 66.7 ± 15.1 yr) and most likely White (76.9%), whereas those with ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia were youngest (59.7 ± 16.6 yr) and least likely White (70.3%). Ventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia was associated with the highest comorbidity burden (mean Charlson score 4.1 ± 2.8) and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia with the lowest (3.2 ± 2.5). Similarly, hospital mortality was highest among patients with ventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (29.2%) and lowest in nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (11.7%), with ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia in-between (21.3%). Among survivors, 24.5% of nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia required a rehospitalization within 30 days of discharge, compared with 22.5% among ventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and 18.8% ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia. Unadjusted hospital length of stay after infection onset was longest among ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia and shortest among nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia patients. Median total hospital costs mirrored length of stay: ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia $77,657, ventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia $62,464, and nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia $39,911.

Conclusions

Both hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia remain associated with significant mortality and cost in the United States. Our analyses confirm that of all three conditions, ventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia carries the highest risk of death. In contrast, ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia remains most costly. Nonventilated hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia survivors were most likely to require a readmission within 30 days of discharge.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia/ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP) due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa — definitive monotherapy versus combination therapy: Evidence syntheses found no differences between monotherapy and combination therapy for definitive treatment, and the panel felt strongly that, in the absence of any demonstrable benefit, the costs and potential side effects of an additional antibiotic were not warranted; therefore, the recommendation is strong despite the low quality of evidence. An exception is that combination therapy is warranted as definitive therapy for patients with HAP/VAP due to P. aeruginosa who have septic shock or a high risk for death, based upon evidence that combination therapy was associated with decreased mortality among patients with pneumonia complicated by septic shock. Background data cited include an initial meta-analysis of Pseudomonas bacteremia showing benefit with combination therapy (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.32–.79) and a large observational analysis showing no reduction in 30-day mortality with combination therapy versus monotherapy (adjusted HR, 1.34; 95% CI, .73–2.47).

### Treatment of severe hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: a systematic review of inclusion and judgment criteria used in randomized controlled trials [^116At5Us]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia (HAP/VAP) are often selected for randomized clinical trials (RCTs) aiming at new drug approval. Guidelines for the design of such RCTs have been repeatedly updated by regulatory agencies. We hypothesized that large variability in the enrolled populations, the endpoints assessed and the HAP/VAP definition criteria may impact the results of these studies, and addressed this through a systematic review of HAP/VAP RCTs.

Methods

A search (Pubmed-Embase-ICAAC-ECCMID) of all RCTs published between 1994 and 2016 comparing antimicrobial treatment for HAP/VAP in the intensive care unit was conducted. The populations enrolled, inclusion/exclusion criteria, statistical design and endpoints assessed were recorded. All unpublished RCTs recorded on the ClinicalTrials.gov registry were also screened.

Results

From the 93 abstracts reviewed, 39 potentially relevant studies were inspected, leading to 27 studies being included. As expected, illness severity or the proportion with VAP (27–100%) differed greatly among the enrolled populations. The HAP/VAP definition used various clinical and biological criteria, and only 55% of studies required a microbiological sample. The mandatory duration of prior hospital stay was variable; the mechanical ventilation duration was an inclusion criterion in only 41% of VAP studies. Nine studies had non-inferiority design, but nine studies (33%) did not have a pre-specified statistical hypothesis. Clinical cure was the primary endpoint in 24 studies, but was recorded in several populations or as the co-primary endpoint in 13 studies. The definition of clinical cure and the timing of its assessment greatly differed. This variability slightly improved over time but remained significant in the 13 registered but currently unpublished RCTs that we screened.

Conclusion

Our study provides a description of populations and endpoints of RCTs evaluating antimicrobials for treatment of HAP/VAP in the ICU. There was significant heterogeneity in enrollment criteria, endpoints and statistical design, which may influence the ability of studies to demonstrate differences between studied drugs.

Ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) in adults — antibiotic therapy is not suggested based on low-quality evidence and uncertain clinical benefit. "In patients with VAT, we suggest not providing antibiotic therapy (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence)". VAT definitions included "positive ETA culture (> 10⁶ CFU/mL)… and no radiographic evidence of nosocomial pneumonia". Evidence review "identified 3 randomized trials", but "the panel decided to exclude 2 of the trials" for indirectness; "the remaining randomized trial randomly assigned 58 patients to receive either intravenous antibiotics or no antibiotics for 8 days". In that trial, the antibiotic group had lower "ICU mortality (18% vs 47%; OR, 0.24, 95% CI, 0.07–.88)", less "subsequent VAP (13% vs 47%; OR, 0.17, 95% CI, .04–.70)", and more "mechanical ventilation–free days (median 12 vs 2 days; P < .001), but no difference in the duration of mechanical ventilation or length of ICU stay". Observational data showed antibiotics were associated with shorter ventilation duration "(−3.5 days; 95% CI −6.88 to −0.19 days)" without significant differences in mortality or ICU stay; isolates commonly included "Acinetobacter (27%), Klebsiella (5%), and MRSA (32%)", with "MDR organisms" in "61%" and polymicrobial infections in "31%". Overall, "the evidence suggests that antibiotic therapy for VAT may shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation; however, it is uncertain whether it improves other clinical outcomes", and "the… quality of evidence… was low".

### Impact of diagnostic criteria on the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia [^117UVYsD]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a frequent complication of prolonged invasive ventilation. Because VAP is largely preventable, its incidence has been used as an index of quality of care in the ICU. However, the incidence of VAP varies according to which criteria are used to identify it. We compared the incidence of VAP obtained with different sets of criteria.

Methods

We collected data from all adult patients admitted to our 35-bed ICU over a 7-month period who had no pulmonary infection on admission or within the first 48 h and who required mechanical ventilation for > 48 h. To diagnose VAP, we applied six published sets of criteria and 89 combinations of criteria for hypoxemia, inflammatory response, purulence of tracheal secretions, chest radiography findings, and microbiologic findings of varying levels of severity. The variables used in each diagnostic algorithm were assessed daily.

Results

Of 1,824 patients admitted to the ICU during the study period, 91 were eligible for inclusion. The incidence of VAP ranged from 4% to 42% when using the six published sets of criteria and from 0% to 44% when using the 89 combinations. The delay before diagnosis of VAP increased from 4 to 8 days with increasingly stringent criteria, and mortality increased from 50% to 80%.

Conclusions

Applying different diagnostic criteria to the same patient population can result in wide variation in the incidence of VAP. The use of different criteria can also influence the time of diagnosis and the associated mortality rate.

### Trends of incidence and risk factors of ventilator-associated pneumonia in elderly patients admitted to French ICUs between 2007 and 2014 [^115N3EXc]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

To assess trends and risk factors of ventilator-associated pneumonia according to age, particularly in the elderly admitted to French ICUs between 2007 and 2014.

Design

Multicenter, prospective French national Healthcare-Associated Infection surveillance network of ICUs ("Réseau REA-Raisin").

Settings

Two-hundred fifty six ICUs in 246 settings in France.

Patients

Included were all adult patients hospitalized greater than or equal to 48 hours in ICUs participating in the network.

Interventions

Ventilator-associated pneumonia surveillance over time.

Measurements and Main Results

Overall and multidrug-resistant organism-related ventilator-associated pneumonia incidence rates were expressed per 1,000 intubation days at risk. Age was stratified into three groups: young (18–64 yr old), old (65–74 yr old), and very old (75+ yr old). Age-stratified multivariate mixed-effects Poisson regressions were undertaken to assess trends of ventilator-associated pneumonia incidence over time, with center as the random effect. Ventilator-associated pneumonia risk factors were also evaluated. Of 206,223 patients, 134,510 were intubated: 47.8% were young, 22.3% were old, and 29.9% were very old. Ventilator-associated pneumonia incidence was lower in the very old group compared with the young group (14.51; 95% CI, 16.95–17.70 vs 17.32; 95% CI, 16.95–17.70, respectively, p < 0.001). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were identified more frequently in very old patients (p < 0.001 and 0.014, respectively). Age-stratified models disclosed that adjusted ventilator-associated pneumonia incidence decreased selectively in the young and old groups over time (adjusted incidence rate ratios, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.82–0.94; p < 0.001 and adjusted incidence rate ratios, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.86–1.04; p = 0.28, respectively). Male gender and trauma were independently associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia in the three age groups, whereas antibiotics at admission was a protective factor. Scheduled surgical ICU and immunodeficiency were risk factors of ventilator-associated pneumonia in the old group (p = 0.003).

Conclusions

Ventilator-associated pneumonia incidence is lower but did not decrease over time in very old patients compared with young patients.

### Clinical pulmonary infection score for ventilator-associated pneumonia: accuracy and inter-observer variability [^111gALD3]. Intensive Care Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

The clinical calculator "Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score for ventilator-associated pneumonia (CPIS)" for ventilator-associated pneumonia.

The Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) is a diagnostic tool used specifically in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting to assess the likelihood of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in patients on mechanical ventilation. The CPIS uses six clinical parameters: temperature, blood leukocyte count, tracheal secretions, oxygenation, radiographic infiltrates, and the culture of tracheal aspirate. Each parameter is scored from 0 to 2, with a higher total score indicating a higher probability of VAP.

The clinical utility of the CPIS is to aid in the diagnosis of VAP, which can be challenging due to the lack of a definitive diagnostic test. It can also guide the initiation and discontinuation of antibiotic therapy in these patients, thereby reducing the risk of antibiotic resistance.

The CPIS may not be applicable or accurate in patients with conditions that can mimic the signs and symptoms of VAP, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary edema, or lung contusion. It should also be used with caution in immunocompromised patients, as they may not exhibit typical signs of infection.

The Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) evaluates the likelihood of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) by analyzing six clinical factors. Each factor receives a predefined score based on its clinical characteristics, which are then summed to arrive at a total score. This total helps medical professionals assess the risk of VAP.

Here's a breakdown of the scoring criteria:

- **Temperature (°C)**:
- 36.5–38.4: 0 points
- 38.5–38.9: 1 point
- ≥ 39.0 or ≤ 36.0: 2 points

- **White blood cell count (mm³)**:
- **4,000–11,000**: 0 points
- **< 4,000 or > 11,000**: 1 point
- **< 4,000 or > 11,000 with band forms ≥ 500**: 2 points

- **Tracheal secretions**:

- **< 14+**: 0 points
- **≥ 14+**: 1 point
- **≥ 14+ with purulent secretions**: 2 points

- Oxygenation (arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen):
- **> 240 or adult respiratory distress syndrome**: 0 points
- **≤ 240 and no adult respiratory distress syndrome**: 2 points

- **Pulmonary radiography**:

- **No infiltrate**: 0 points
- **Diffuse or patchy infiltrate**: 1 point
- **Localized infiltrate**: 2 points

- **Culture of tracheal aspirate specimen**:

- **Pathogenic bacteria cultured ≤ 1+ or no growth**: 0 points
- **Pathogenic bacteria cultured > 1+**: 1 point
- Pathogenic bacteria cultured > 1+ with the same pathogenic bacteria on Gram stain > 1+: 2 points

To use the CPIS, each clinical parameter is evaluated, and the corresponding scores are added to form a total score ranging from 0 to 12. The interpretation based on the total score is straightforward:

- A score of 0 to 6 suggests that ventilator-associated pneumonia is unlikely.
- A score of 7 or higher indicates that ventilator-associated pneumonia is likely.

This systematic evaluation of clinical data ensures that healthcare professionals can make informed decisions regarding the presence of VAP.

### Strategies to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia, ventilator-associated events, and nonventilator hospital-acquired pneumonia in acute-care hospitals: 2022 update [^113qFLiC]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Section 1: Rationale and statements of concern

Hospitalized patients are at high risk for pneumonia and other pulmonary complications, particularly patients on mechanical ventilation. Hospital-acquired pneumonia is the most common nosocomial infection. It affects ~1 in 100 patients overall and up to 1 in 10 patients on invasive mechanical ventilation. The true incidence of nosocomial pneumonia is difficult to discern, however, because diagnostic criteria vary widely, correlate poorly with histology, are often subjective, and are applied differently by different surveyors. – Many hospitals have reported dramatic decreases in VAP rates over the past 20 years, but the extent to which these declines reflect better care versus stricter application of subjective surveillance criteria remains unclear. Clinical surveys suggest that 5%–10% of ventilated patients continue to be treated for VAP, – and an independent audit conducted by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported that VAP rates were stable between 2005 and 2013. Patients on mechanical ventilation are at risk for a variety of serious complications in addition to pneumonia. Examples include acute respiratory distress syndrome, fluid overload, atelectasis, pneumothorax, barotrauma, and pulmonary embolism. The CDC created VAE definitions to better capture the breadth of serious complications associated with mechanical ventilation. Approximately 5%–10% of mechanically ventilated patients develop VAEs. – The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has been associated with an increase in the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia due to hospital-acquired severe acute respiratory coronavirus virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections and hospital-acquired bacterial superinfections in patients admitted with COVID-19 pneumonia. – Differentiating superinfection from underlying COVID-19 pneumonia and COVID-19–related ARDS is challenging due to considerable overlap in clinical signs.
VAP, VAE, and NV-HAP are detrimental to patients and increase costs. The attributable mortality of VAP is estimated to be ~10% but varies considerably by type and severity of underlying illness. – VAP and VAE extend duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, prolong intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay, and increase mortality risk. They are also associated with greater use of antimicrobials and higher costs. Patients with VAEs are ~50% more likely to die compared to similar patients with VAP.NV-HAP is associated with a doubling of the length of time until discharge and substantially higher mortality rates compared to similar patients without NV-HAP.

### Systematic review of studies investigating ventilator associated pneumonia diagnostics in intensive care [^113fPGmv]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

There are three main limitations to our review. Firstly, in order to be diagnosed with VAP, a patient must be at risk of VAP, and there is no standard definition for patients at risk. For the purposes of this study, we defined those at risk of VAP as those who have undergone more than 48 h of mechanical ventilation. Secondly, many included studies enrolled only patients with suspected VAP, and this means many listed reference standards must be prefixed with "clinically suspected VAP". This level of clinical suspicion was not systematically collected by us. This is particularly noteworthy in considering the reference standards listed in Table 3. Thirdly, although data extraction for this review was completed before the impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), the pandemic nonetheless interfered with the delivery time of this review.
