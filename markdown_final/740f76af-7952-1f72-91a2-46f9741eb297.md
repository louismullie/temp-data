## Question

How does the stepwise management approach for asthma in children aged 6–12 years differ from that in adults?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how the stepwise management approach for asthma in children aged 6–12 years differs from that in adults. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching framework and whether both groups use the same stepwise principle. Then, I should verify the key differences by step, including reliever choices, controller options, dosing ceilings, and add-on therapies. Next, I will examine safety nuances and growth considerations in children. After that, I should review referral thresholds and step-down principles. Finally, I will synthesize practical, step-by-step distinctions and double-check any points that seem uncertain before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle. Both children 6–11 years and adults/adolescents follow a stepwise approach that cycles through assessment, treatment adjustment, and review, with the goal of good symptom control and minimal future risk; treatment is stepped up or down based on response, and step-down is considered after 2–3 months of good control, so the framework itself is aligned across ages [^a32b60c2] [^55ce005b] [^ff163c6f].

> Now, I need to check the most consequential difference: reliever therapy. In adults and adolescents, GINA's preferred Track 1 uses low-dose ICS-formoterol as the reliever at all steps, including as-needed-only in Steps 1–2 and as MART in Steps 3–5, which reduces severe exacerbations by about 60% versus SABA alone; this is a major shift away from SABA-only rescue [^4598aed1] [^4ad523f0]. In contrast, for children 6–11 years, GINA recommends as-needed SABA or low-dose ICS-formoterol as reliever in Steps 3–4, and for Step 1 prefers ICS taken whenever SABA is used rather than ICS-formoterol as-needed; SMART is an option but is not the default reliever strategy across all steps in this age group, reflecting less robust pediatric evidence and device/formulation constraints [^084af813] [^97348a06] [^091c23d2].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about Step 1 in children. I initially thought GINA endorsed as-needed ICS-formoterol for 6–11 years in Step 1, but wait, let me verify the exact wording. GINA 2024 recommends low-dose ICS taken whenever SABA is used for Step 1 in children 6–11 years, and notes that studies of as-needed-only ICS-formoterol in this age group are underway; this means ICS-formoterol as reliever is not the preferred Step 1 approach for 6–11 years yet, unlike in adults, where as-needed ICS-formoterol is preferred in Steps 1–2 [^cdf97470] [^4598aed1].

> Next, I should review controller choices by step. In adults/adolescents, Track 1 favors ICS-formoterol MART from Step 3 upward, with low-dose maintenance in Step 3 and medium-dose in Step 4; Track 2 uses daily ICS or ICS-LABA with SABA reliever, and LAMA is considered as add-on in Step 5 when control remains suboptimal [^4598aed1] [^56144334]. In children 6–11 years, preferred Step 2 is daily low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA, with alternatives including ICS taken with SABA or daily LTRA; Step 3 options include low-dose ICS-LABA, medium-dose ICS, or very low-dose ICS-formoterol MART; Step 4 includes medium-dose ICS-LABA or low-dose MART; and Step 5 emphasizes referral for phenotyping and consideration of biologics, with tiotropium as an add-on option in children aged 6 years and older [^97348a06] [^084af813] [^7b7fb5f8].

> I should confirm dosing ceilings and safety nuances. For adults/adolescents using ICS-formoterol, the maximum formoterol dose is 12 puffs/day (54 mcg), whereas for children 4–11 years it is 8 puffs/day (36 mcg); this lower ceiling reflects pediatric safety considerations and the need to monitor total beta-agonist exposure [^cdabadb9] [^6ba48560]. Let me also consider growth effects: daily ICS can suppress growth velocity by about 0.7% in the first 1–2 years, but this effect is not progressive and final adult height is minimally affected; importantly, intermittent ICS strategies may spare growth compared with daily ICS in some pediatric studies, though long-term lung outcomes remain uncertain and daily ICS generally provides better control metrics, so clinicians must individualize [^d2ac91a8] [^258e08ce].

> I will now examine add-on therapies and referral thresholds. In adults/adolescents, Step 5 includes LAMA add-on and biologics for severe asthma, with phenotype-guided selection; in children 6–11 years, tiotropium is an evidence-based add-on from age 6, and biologics such as anti-IgE, anti–IL-4Rα, and anti–IL-5 are considered after specialist referral and phenotyping; referral is recommended if symptoms persist despite Step 4 therapy in children, aligning with a lower threshold than some adult pathways [^7b7fb5f8] [^68ce14d6] [^2ed56d7e].

> But wait, what about step-down and reassessment cadence. Both groups recommend stepping down after 2–3 months of good control, typically reducing ICS dose by 25–50% at 3-month intervals, and reviewing response 2–3 months after any change; in children, I should double-check that reassessment after starting or changing controller therapy is advised at 2–3 months, which it is, with closer follow-up if control is poor or risk is high [^ff163c6f] [^121c9240] [^a32b60c2].

> Let me synthesize the practical distinctions by step to ensure nothing is missing. For mild, infrequent symptoms, adults/adolescents prefer as-needed ICS-formoterol, whereas children 6–11 years prefer ICS taken whenever SABA is used or daily low-dose ICS with SABA reliever. For moderate symptoms, both move to ICS-LABA or ICS-formoterol MART, but pediatric dosing and device selection must be age-appropriate. For severe disease, both emphasize referral and phenotype-guided add-ons, with tiotropium and biologics available from age 6 in children. Across steps, children have a lower formoterol daily maximum and require explicit growth monitoring and caregiver education to sustain adherence [^4598aed1] [^084af813] [^cdabadb9] [^d2ac91a8].

> Finally, I should confirm the bottom line. The key differences are the default reliever strategy (ICS-formoterol preferred across adult steps versus SABA or ICS-formoterol selectively in children), the strength of evidence supporting as-needed ICS-formoterol in Steps 1–2 (strong in adults, emerging/limited in 6–11 years), pediatric-specific dosing ceilings and growth considerations, and earlier referral and somewhat more cautious add-on sequencing in children; otherwise, both groups share the same stepwise, control-based philosophy with iterative assessment and step-down when stable [^4598aed1] [^084af813] [^cdabadb9] [^68ce14d6].

---

The stepwise management of asthma in children aged 6–12 years differs from adults in **reliever choice** and **step-up thresholds**. Children should avoid SABA-only therapy [^882ab708] and use ICS-containing regimens; as-needed ICS-formoterol is not preferred in this age group due to limited evidence [^091c23d2], so ICS with SABA is standard [^084af813]. Step-up occurs sooner in children — often at Step 3 for frequent symptoms — and LAMA (tiotropium) is an add-on option from age 6 [^7b7fb5f8]. Growth effects from ICS are monitored, and step-down is considered after 3 months of control [^121c9240] [^47b357bc]. Adults have more biologic options and higher formoterol dose limits, whereas children have fewer approved biologics and lower formoterol ceilings [^cdabadb9].

---

## Reliever therapy

- **Children (6–12 years)**: Avoid SABA-only therapy [^882ab708]; use ICS-containing regimens. As-needed ICS-formoterol is not preferred due to limited pediatric evidence [^091c23d2], so ICS with SABA is standard [^084af813].

- **Adults**: As-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol is preferred in Steps 1–2 [^4598aed1] for its superior exacerbation reduction and simplicity [^4ad523f0].

---

## Controller therapy and step-up criteria

| **Step** | **Children (6–12 years)** | **Adults (≥ 12 years)** |
|-|-|-|
| Step 1 | ICS whenever SABA is used [^cdf97470] | As-needed ICS-formoterol [^4598aed1] |
| Step 2 | Daily low-dose ICS + as-needed SABA [^3464faf1] | Daily low-dose ICS + as-needed SABA or as-needed ICS-formoterol [^4598aed1] |
| Step 3 | Low-dose ICS-LABA, medium-dose ICS, or very low-dose ICS-formoterol MART [^0ff3f3fd] | Low-dose ICS-formoterol MART [^051d489a] |
| Step 4 | Medium-dose ICS-LABA or low-dose ICS-formoterol MART [^ab7693d2] | Medium-dose ICS-formoterol MART [^0cf544c7] |
| Step 5 | Refer for specialist assessment; add tiotropium or biologics (omalizumab, mepolizumab) if eligible [^68ce14d6] [^7b7fb5f8] | Add LAMA, biologics, or low-dose OCS [^ce068196] |

---

Children step up sooner for frequent symptoms or exacerbations, and **LAMA is an add-on from age 6** [^7b7fb5f8].

---

## Safety considerations

Growth effects from ICS are monitored in children, with **modest, non-progressive effects** that typically normalize over time [^d2ac91a8]. Formoterol dose limits are lower in children (**8 puffs/day**) than in adults (**12 puffs/day**) [^cdabadb9].

---

## Step-down therapy

Step-down is considered after **3 months of good control** in children [^121c9240], with a 25–50% ICS dose reduction [^47b357bc]; in adults, step-down is also considered after sustained control, with individualized tapering [^ff163c6f].

---

## Specialist referral

Referral is recommended for children with persistent symptoms or exacerbations despite Step 4 therapy [^68ce14d6], whereas adults are generally referred after Step 5 or when severe asthma is suspected [^2ed56d7e].

---

## Summary of key differences

| **Aspect** | **Children (6–12 years)** | **Adults (≥ 12 years)** |
|-|-|-|
| Reliever therapy | ICS + SABA; avoid SABA-only | ICS-formoterol preferred |
| Step-up criteria | Sooner for frequent symptoms | Later, more individualized |
| LAMA use | From age 6 | From age 12 |
| Growth monitoring | Required | Not routinely required |
| Formoterol limit | 8 puffs/day | 12 puffs/day |
| Biologics | Limited options (omalizumab, mepolizumab) | Broader options |
| Step-down | After 3 months of control | After sustained control |

---

The main differences reflect **age-specific evidence**, safety, and regulatory constraints, with children emphasizing ICS-containing regimens, earlier step-up, and growth surveillance, while adults have more biologic options and higher formoterol dose limits.

Population-level versus patient-level decisions about asthma treatment — population-level selection states that when choosing between treatment options at a population level (e.g., national formularies, health maintenance organizations, national guidelines), the 'preferred' medication at each step is the best treatment for most patients, based on efficacy, effectiveness, safety, and availability and cost at the population level, mainly based on evidence about symptoms and exacerbations (from randomized controlled trials, pragmatic studies and strong observational data). For Steps 1–5, there are different population-level recommendations by age-group (adults/adolescents, children 6–11 years, children 5 years and younger), and in Step 5, there are also different population-level recommendations depending on the inflammatory phenotype, Type 2 or non-Type 2.

Adjusting ongoing asthma treatment in adults, adolescents, and children aged 6–11 years — once asthma treatment has begun, ongoing treatment decisions are based on a personalized cycle of assessment, adjustment of treatment, and review of the response, and for each patient asthma medication can be adjusted up or down in a stepwise approach to achieve good symptom control and minimize future risk of exacerbations, persistent airflow limitation and medication side-effects; when good asthma control has been maintained for 2–3 months, treatment may be stepped down to find the patient's minimum effective treatment. People's ethnic and racial backgrounds may be associated with different responses to treatment and these are not necessarily associated with genetic differences. If a patient has persisting uncontrolled symptoms and/or exacerbations despite 2–3 months of ICS-containing treatment, assess and correct the following common problems before considering any step up in treatment: incorrect inhaler technique, poor adherence, persistent exposure at home/work to agents such as allergens, tobacco smoke, indoor or outdoor air pollution, or to medications such as beta-blockers or (in some patients) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), comorbidities that may contribute to respiratory symptoms and poor quality of life, and incorrect diagnosis.

Making decisions about asthma treatment — Asthma treatment is adjusted in a continual cycle of assessment, treatment, and review of the patient's response in both symptom control and future risk (of exacerbations and side-effects), and of patient preferences. For population-level decisions about asthma medications, the 'preferred' regimens in Steps 1–4 represent the best treatments for most patients based on evidence about safety, efficacy and effectiveness, with emphasis on symptom burden and exacerbation risk, and for Steps 1–5 there are different preferred population-level recommendations for adults/adolescents, children 6–11 years, and children 5 years and younger, with Step 5 also differing by inflammatory phenotype (Type 2 or non-Type 2). For individual patients, shared decision-making about treatment should also consider characteristics, phenotype or environmental exposures that predict risk or response, together with the patient's goals or concerns and practical issues (inhaler technique, adherence, medication access and cost to the patient). Optimize asthma management, including inhaled therapy and non-pharmacologic strategies, to reduce the need for oral corticosteroids (OCS) and their multiple associated adverse effects.

Stepwise approach for managing asthma.

In preparing the step diagrams (Figs 2–4), the Expert Panel used some of the definitions and assumptions from EPR-3. The step diagrams that follow this section retain the EPR-3 recommendations that the Expert Panel did not address in the current report. The Expert Panel encourages readers to review the footnotes in the step diagrams because they offer important information about the use of these diagrams.

The following conventions apply to Figs 2 to 4:
Each figure applies to the care of individuals with asthma in one age group. Fig 2 applies only to ages 0 to 4 years. Fig 3 applies only to ages 5 to 11 years. Fig 4 applies only to ages 12 years and older.
Clinicians decide which step of care is appropriate depending on whether the individual is newly diagnosed (ie, is treatment naive) or whether the clinician is adjusting the individual's therapy to achieve asthma control. For newly diagnosed or treatment-naive individuals, clinicians should first choose the appropriate step diagram for the person's age and then consider both the individual's level of asthma impairment and risk when selecting the initial step and treatment. Within a given step, the preferred options are the best management choices supported by the evidence that the Expert Panel reviewed. When the available evidence is insufficient or does not change a previous recommendation, the step diagrams list preferred options from the EPR-3 step diagrams. Within a given step, an alternative option(s) is management strategies that are less effective or have more limited evidence than the preferred options. Clinicians and patients may choose the alternative treatments if individuals with asthma are currently receiving this therapy and their asthma is under control, if the preferred treatments are not available or too costly, or if the individuals with asthma prefer an alternative treatment. Preferred and alternative treatments within a step category are listed alphabetically unless the Expert Panel has established a rank order of preference for the preferred or alternative treatments. A lack of rank order is indicated by "or" between treatment options.
In the stepwise approach to therapy for asthma, the clinician escalates treatment as needed (by moving to a higher step) or, if possible, deescalates treatment (by moving to a lower step) once the individual's asthma is well controlled for at least three consecutive months. For individuals with persistent asthma (ie, who require treatment at Step 2 or above), clinicians should be guided by the current step of treatment and the individual's response to therapy (in terms of both asthma control and adverse effects) both currently and in the past to decide whether to step up, step down, or continue the current therapy. For individuals with persistent asthma who are using an alternative treatment and have an unsatisfactory or inadequate response to that therapy, the Expert Panel suggests replacing the alternative treatment with the preferred treatment within the same step before stepping up therapy.
The Expert Panel did not add management options that the panel recommends against, or for which the evidence is insufficient to determine harms and benefits, to the step diagrams. Instead, these options are listed in Table IF.
The guidance provided in the step diagrams is meant to assist and not replace the clinical decision making required for individual patient managementand the input from individuals with asthma about their preferences.

Children 5 years and younger — stepwise management and prerequisites before stepping up therapy: Treatment follows a stepwise approach with medication adjusted up or down to achieve good symptom control and minimize future risk, and the need for controller treatment should be re-assessed regularly. If symptom control is poor and/or exacerbations persist despite 3 months of adequate controller therapy, confirm that symptoms are due to asthma rather than another condition (and refer for expert assessment if in doubt), check and correct inhaler technique, confirm good adherence with the prescribed dose, consider a trial of another treatment option for that step, and enquire about risk factors such as allergen or tobacco smoke exposure before stepping up.

### Step-up and step-down treatments for optimal asthma control in children and adolescents [^cfe749b3]. The Journal of Asthma (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review therapeutic options for stepwise management of pediatric asthma in the context of this population's unique needs such as potential effects of asthma, treatments, or both on growth and psychosocial development, and caregiver involvement.

Data Sources and Study Selection

We conducted PubMed searches to identify relevant articles then reviewed resultant articles, guidelines for asthma management in children, and articles from personal files.

Results

Stepwise management of asthma, similar to adults, is recommended for children in current global and US guidelines. Treatment may be stepped up or stepped down temporarily or long-term based on response over time. Inhaled corticosteroids remain the recommended treatment for persistent childhood asthma and any potential small effects on growth are considered relatively minor compared with their benefit. Controller medication options for patients < 18years old are limited, especially for Global Initiative for Asthma Steps 2–5. The long-acting antimuscarinic antagonist tiotropium (Steps 4/5, patients aged ≥ 12years) and in certain circumstances (Step 5), anti-immunoglobulin E (aged ≥ 6years) and interleukin-5 antibodies (aged ≥ 12years) are newer treatment options. Tiotropium is indicated in the United States and Europe for patients ≥ 6years old. Stepping down treatment, which is recommended but infrequently practiced, can maintain symptom control and minimize adverse events while substantially reducing costs. Patient education and better monitoring remain important for self-management and optimum outcomes.

Conclusion

A need exists to target individual treatment goals for children with asthma by using step-up and step-down approaches to maximize treatment benefits and minimize potential adverse effects.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^6e371ac6]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma pharmacotherapy for children of 5 years of age or younger — good control of asthma can be achieved in the overwhelming majority of young children with a pharmacological intervention strategy, and a stepwise treatment approach is recommended based on symptom patterns, risk of exacerbations and side-effects, and response to initial treatment; generally, treatment includes the daily, long-term use of low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to keep asthma well controlled and reliever medications for as-needed symptom relief, and the choice of inhaler device is also an important consideration. When recommending treatment for a young child, both general and individual questions apply, including identifying the 'preferred' medication option at each treatment step to control asthma symptoms and minimize future risk, with decisions based on data for efficacy, effectiveness and safety from clinical trials and on observational data, considering that studies suggest factors such as allergic sensitization and/or peripheral blood count may help to better identify which children are more likely to have a short-term response to ICS, and accounting for response to previous treatment, patient characteristics that contribute to symptoms or risk of flare-ups, preferences of the parent/caregiver, and practical issues.

Children 6–11 years Step 2 — preferred controller therapy is regular low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) plus as-needed short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA), which reduces the risk of serious exacerbations compared with SABA-only treatment; supporting evidence in children includes a long-term study in which patients aged 6–66 years received placebo or low-dose budesonide (200 mcg/day for children < 11 years) for 3 years, and low-dose ICS reduced the risk of serious exacerbations by 40%, improved lung function, increased symptom-free days and decreased days lost from school.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^90940596]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). High credibility.

Adolescents and adults with mild persistent asthma (age 12 years and older) — the Expert Panel conditionally recommends two Step 2 options: either daily low-dose inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) with as-needed short-acting beta-agonist (SABA) for quick relief or as-needed ICS and SABA used concomitantly, with a conditional recommendation and moderate certainty of evidence. In this recommendation, "intermittent" ICS dosing is defined as the temporary use of an ICS in response to worsening asthma in an individual who is not taking ICS controller therapy regularly; the recommendation does not apply to ages 5 to 11 years, and the Panel has made no recommendation for children aged 0 to 4 years or 5 to 11 years with mild persistent asthma because of insufficient evidence. For implementation, individuals aged 12 years and older with a low or high perception of symptoms may not be good candidates for as-needed ICS therapy and regular low-dose ICS with SABA for quick-relief therapy may be preferred; one studied approach is two to four puffs of albuterol followed by 80 to 250 μg of beclomethasone equivalent every 4 hours as needed, administered sequentially in two separate inhalers. Individuals can initiate intermittent therapy at home but should receive regular follow-up, and clinicians should inform individuals that the two treatment options do not have different effects on asthma control, asthma quality of life, or the frequency of asthma exacerbations, with side effects equally infrequent; shared decision making will allow the best choice to be made for a particular individual.

Objective tests for asthma diagnosis and management

The treatment approaches to asthma vary in different childhood age groups: young children (age ≤ 5 years), school age (6–11 years), and adolescence (age 12–18 years), because what works for one age group might not be the best approach for another. Most school age children with asthma achieve good symptom control when treated with low to moderate dose ICS with or without a longacting β agonist, but a minority (3–5% of children with asthma)have severe disease and poor symptom control despite maximal treatment, and these children need further escalation in support and intervention. Not all these children with symptoms have severe, treatment resistant asthma, which is rare.

The World Health Organization categorised severe asthma into three groups: untreated severe asthma resulting from a failure of diagnosis or lack of availability of treatment (which is not confined to low and middle income countries); severe asthma that is difficult to treat, whereby social and environmental factors or comorbidities hinder the response to treatment; and severe, treatment resistant asthma that requires high level treatment with ICS and other controllers to achieve control or that remains uncontrolled despite high level treatment (figure 1).

Figure 1
Stepwise protocol for assessment and management of children with severe asthma. BDR = bronchodilator reversibility; DOT = directly observed treatment; FeNO = fractional exhaled nitric oxide; ICS = inhaled corticosteroids; MART = maintenance and reliever treatment

A multidisciplinary approach is paramount in children with severe asthma. Severe asthma necessitates a broader approach that recognises extrapulmonary influences such as adherence, family values, comorbidities such as exposure to tobacco smoke, ongoing exposure to aeroallergens to which the child is sensitised, obesity, breathing pattern disorders, and poor symptom perception. Ancillary testing to exclude alternative diagnoses might be indicated. This team approach is essential to ensure that the right children are prescribed expensive and invasive biological medicines.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^0ff3f3fd]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Children 6–11 years Step 3 — preferred options, after checking inhaler technique and adherence and treating modifiable risk factors, are: increase ICS to medium dose plus as-needed SABA reliever (Evidence A); change to combination low-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA reliever (Evidence A); or switch to maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART) with a very low dose of ICS-formoterol (Evidence B). Evidence cited includes a large study of children aged 4–11 years in which combination ICS-LABA was non-inferior to the same dose of ICS alone for severe exacerbations with no difference in symptom control or reliever use, and a single study of MART with very low-dose budesonide-formoterol (100/6 metered dose, 80/4.5 mcg delivered dose for both maintenance and reliever) that showed a large reduction in exacerbations compared with the same dose of budesonide-formoterol plus SABA reliever or compared with higher-dose ICS; because individual children's responses vary, clinicians are advised to "try the other controller options above before considering Step 4 treatment".

Guidelines

Table 3 lists key recommendations from three international guidelines for the diagnosis and management of asthma in children. Overall, they are similar in their recommendations for the use of objectives measurements to confirm the diagnosis of asthma. The guidelines, however, differ in the age brackets used to classify management recommendations, which slightly limits comparisons. A key fundamental difference is that the recent GINA guideline does not recommend the use of SABA alone for the management of asthma in children and adolescents aged 6 years and above. For mild asthma (step 1 treatment), GINA advise using a combination of low dose ICS and formoterol inhaler as needed. In children aged 6–11 years, owing to device limitations, SABA as needed via a metered dose inhaler plus a dose of ICS at the same time is recommended as step 1 treatment. GINA further recommend that a combination of low dose ICS and formoterol inhaler is used as a reliever for children aged 12 years and over. The GINA recommendations are a major change to the management of mild asthma and reliever treatment in asthma.

Figures 5 and 6 summarize the GINA options for initial asthma medications in adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years newly diagnosed with asthma. Once treatment has been initiated, ongoing medication decisions are based on the same personalized cycle, in which treatment is stepped up and down according to the patient's needs within a track, using the same reliever. Treatment can also be switched between tracks according to patient needs and preferences. Before any step-up (Fig. 2), it is essential to check adherence to treatment, inhaled technique, relevant comorbidities and risk factors, and environmental factors affecting asthma (Supplementary Fig. 1).

### The pediatric asthma yardstick: practical recommendations for a sustained step-up in asthma therapy for children with inadequately controlled asthma [^3673010a]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2018). Low credibility.

Current asthma guidelines recommend a control-based approach to management involving assessment of impairment and risk followed by implementation of treatment strategies individualized according to the patient's needs and preferences. However, for children with asthma, achieving control can be elusive. Although tools are available to help children (and families) track and manage day-to-day symptoms, when and how to implement a longer-term step-up in care is less clear. Furthermore, treatment is challenged by the 3 age groups of childhood-adolescence (12–18 years old), school age (6–11 years old), and young children (≤ 5 years old)-and what works for 1 age group might not be the best approach for another. The Pediatric Asthma Yardstick provides an in-depth assessment of when and how to step-up therapy for the child with not well or poorly controlled asthma. Development of this tool follows others in the Yardstick series, presenting patient profiles and step-up strategies based on current guidance documents, but modified according to newer data and the authors' combined clinical experience. The objective is to provide clinicians who treat children with asthma practical and clinically relevant recommendations for each step-up and each intervention, with the intent of helping practitioners better treat their pediatric patients with asthma, particularly those who do not always respond to recommended therapies.

Implementation guidance

Clinician's Summary:

For individuals aged 12years and older with mild persistent asthma, the Expert Panel recommends either of the following two treatments as part of Step 2 therapy: a daily low-dose ICS and as-needed SABA for quick-relief therapy or intermittent as-needed SABA and an ICS used concomitantly (ie, one after the other) for worsening asthma. In this recommendation, "intermittent" ICS dosing is defined as the temporary use of an ICS in response to worsening asthma in an individual with asthma who is not taking ICS controller therapy regularly. This recommendation does not apply to ages 5 to 11 years because this therapy has not been adequately studied in this age group.

The Expert Panel makes the following suggestions for implementation of intermittent ICS dosing in individuals aged 12 years and older:
Individuals aged 12 years and older with mild persistent asthma who are not taking asthma treatment may benefit from this therapy. The Expert Panel has made no recommendation for children aged 0 to 4 years or 5 to 11 years with mild persistent asthma because of insufficient evidence.
Individuals aged 12 years and older with asthma and a low or high perception of symptoms may not be good candidates for as-needed ICS therapy. Regular low-dose ICS with SABA for quick-relief therapy may be preferred for such patients to avoid ICS undertreatment (low symptom perception) or overtreatment (high symptom perception).
Based on the regimen assessed in three of the four studies on intermittent ICS dosing, one approach to intermittent therapy is two to four puffs of albuterol followed by 80 to 250 μg of beclomethasone equivalent every 4 hours as needed for asthma symptoms. In these studies, the clinician determined the dosing a priori. Currently, these medications need to be administered sequentially in two separate inhalers, but combination inhalers with albuterol and an ICS may be available in the United States in the future.
Individuals who use this type of therapy can initiate intermittent therapy at home. However, they should receive regular follow-up to ensure that the intermittent regimen is still appropriate.
What clinicians should discuss with patients and families: Clinicians should inform individuals that the two treatment options do not have different effects on asthma control, asthma quality of life, or the frequency of asthma exacerbations when studied in large groups of people. Similarly, side effects are equally infrequent with daily and intermittent use. Shared decision making will allow the best choice to be made for a particular individual.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^051d489a]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Asthma step-up therapy — uncontrolled despite good adherence and inhaler technique: Before stepping up, first confirm symptoms are due to asthma and address common problems, then in adults and adolescents the preferred Step 3 is Track 1 with low-dose inhaled corticosteroid–formoterol as maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART), which reduces severe exacerbations versus maintenance inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) plus long-acting beta agonist (LABA) with as-needed short-acting beta agonist (SABA); if needed, increase to medium dose (Step 4) by increasing maintenance inhalations. MART is also a preferred option at Steps 3 and 4 for children 6–11 years with a lower dose ICS-formoterol inhaler. ICS-formoterol should not be used as the reliever for patients taking a different ICS-LABA maintenance treatment. Other Step 3 options (Track 2 and in children) include maintenance ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA or ICS-SABA; for children 6–11 years, medium-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA, and try other controller options at the same step before stepping up.

Regarding medical management for asthma, more specifically with respect to stepwise management, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to use the following track as the alternative stepwise approach to the management of asthma in adult and adolescent patients, with as-needed inhaled-corticosteroid-short-acting β-agonist or as-needed short-acting β-agonist as the reliever in all steps:

The 2007 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma initiated a stepwise model based on an ongoing assessment of asthma severity and control. 9 An increasing step number corresponds to augmenting levels of intervention, and a decreasing step number corresponds to tapering down levels of intervention. Asthma severity refers to the intensity of the disease process, which is intrinsic to an individual's disease; severity is determined upon initiation of treatment. In contrast, asthma control is the degree to which symptoms impact a patient's life (eg, activity limitations); control must be continually assessed in order to adjust therapy accordingly. The NAEPP guidelines further focus on two domains of severity and control: impairment and risk. Impairment refers to the extent to which the frequency and intensity of asthma symptoms result in functional limitations for the patient, and risk refers to the likelihood of future asthma exacerbations, decline in lung function/lung growth, or adverse effects from medication. Severity also takes into account the amount of medication necessary to achieve control. Achieving and maintaining control is a major goal of asthma therapy; poorly controlled asthma is associated with increased risk of exacerbations. 10 Reducing impairment (eg, by preventing chronic symptoms) as well as minimizing future risk (eg, by preventing exacerbations) are therefore critical to the long‐term management of asthma. 9 The 2018 GINA report, which is updated and revised more frequently, also recommends a stepwise approach for asthma therapy. 2

Because asthma is heterogeneous in presentation and variable in course over time, its clinical consequences can be unpredictable if not assessed by objective determinants, such as lung function or airway hyperresponsiveness. Limiting the evaluation to the periodic use of subjective determinants of asthma, such as past interval history or asthma control scores, does not accurately reflect the natural history of an individual into adulthood. Persistent asthma refers to a continuation of symptoms, whereas asthma progression can be considered a worsening of asthma symptoms, potentially accompanied by a decline in lung function. 11 Although some children experience persistent or even progressive asthma as they enter adulthood, others experience a remission of symptoms as they age. 12, 13, 14

Initial asthma treatment in children 6–11 years provides preferred initial treatment by presenting symptoms, and states that these recommendations are based on evidence and consensus. Infrequent asthma symptoms (e.g., 1–2 days/week or less): Low-dose ICS taken whenever SABA is taken (Evidence B) in combination or in separate inhalers. Asthma symptoms 2–5 days/week: Low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA (Evidence A); other options include taking ICS whenever SABA is taken in combination or separate inhalers (Evidence B), or daily LTRA (Evidence A for less effectiveness for exacerbations than ICS), and to consider likely adherence if the reliever is SABA. Asthma symptoms most days (e.g., 4–5 days/week) or waking due to asthma once a week or more: Low-dose ICS-LABA plus as needed SABA (Evidence A), OR Medium-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA (Evidence A), OR Very-low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever (Evidence B); other options include daily low-dose ICS and LTRA, plus as-needed SABA. Daily asthma symptoms, waking at night once or more a week, and low lung function: Medium-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA, OR low-dose ICS-formoterol maintenance-and-reliever (MART). Initial asthma presentation during an acute exacerbation: Treat as for exacerbation, including a short course of OCS if the exacerbation is severe; commence Step 3 or Step 4 treatment, and arrange follow-up.

Track 2 (alternative) Step 2 for adults and adolescents — low-dose maintenance ICS plus as-needed SABA — Regular daily low-dose ICS with as-needed SABA was standard of care for mild asthma for the past 30 years, and most guidelines recommended its use only for patients with asthma symptoms more than twice a week. Most studies of daily low-dose ICS have included patients with symptoms between 3–7 days a week. There is a large body of evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies showing that the risks of severe exacerbations, hospitalizations and mortality are substantially reduced with regular low-dose ICS; symptoms and exercise-induced bronchoconstriction are also reduced, and severe exacerbations have also been reduced with low-dose ICS even in patients with symptoms 0–1 days a week. Clinicians should be aware that adherence with maintenance ICS in the community is extremely low.

### Global Initiative for Asthma strategy 2021: executive summary and rationale for key changes [^4ad523f0]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2022). Medium credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) Strategy Report provides clinicians with an annually updated evidence-based strategy for asthma management and prevention, which can be adapted for local circumstances (e.g., medication availability). This article summarizes key recommendations from GINA 2021, and the evidence underpinning recent changes. GINA recommends that asthma in adults and adolescents should not be treated solely with short-acting β 2 -agonist (SABA), because of the risks of SABA-only treatment and SABA overuse, and evidence for benefit of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). Large trials show that as-needed combination ICS-formoterol reduces severe exacerbations by ≥ 60% in mild asthma compared with SABA alone, with similar exacerbation, symptom, lung function, and inflammatory outcomes as daily ICS plus as-needed SABA. Key changes in GINA 2021 include division of the treatment figure for adults and adolescents into two tracks. Track 1 (preferred) has low-dose ICS-formoterol as the reliever at all steps: as needed only in Steps 1–2 (mild asthma), and with daily maintenance ICS-formoterol (maintenance-and-reliever therapy, "MART") in Steps 3–5. Track 2 (alternative) has as-needed SABA across all steps, plus regular ICS (Step 2) or ICS-long-acting β 2 -agonist (Steps 3–5). For adults with moderate-to-severe asthma, GINA makes additional recommendations in Step 5 for add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists and azithromycin, with add-on biologic therapies for severe asthma. For children 6–11 years, new treatment options are added at Steps 3–4. Across all age groups and levels of severity, regular personalized assessment, treatment of modifiable risk factors, self-management education, skills training, appropriate medication adjustment, and review remain essential to optimize asthma outcomes.

### Managing asthma in adolescents and adults: 2020 asthma guideline update from the national asthma education and prevention program [^ce068196]. JAMA (2020). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Asthma is a major public health problem worldwide and is associated with excess morbidity, mortality, and economic costs associated with lost productivity. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program has released the 2020 Asthma Guideline Update with updated evidence-based recommendations for treatment of patients with asthma.

Objective

To report updated recommendations for 6 topics for clinical management of adolescents and adults with asthma: (1) intermittent inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs); (2) add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists; (3) fractional exhaled nitric oxide; (4) indoor allergen mitigation; (5) immunotherapy; and (6) bronchial thermoplasty.

Evidence Review

The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Advisory Council chose 6 topics to update the 2007 asthma guidelines based on results from a 2014 needs assessment. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality conducted systematic reviews of these 6 topics based on literature searches up to March-April 2017. Reviews were updated through October 2018 and used by an expert panel (n = 19) that included asthma content experts, primary care clinicians, dissemination and implementation experts, and health policy experts to develop 19 new recommendations using the GRADE method. The 17 recommendations for individuals aged 12 years or older are reported in this Special Communication.

Findings

From 20 572 identified references, 475 were included in the 6 systematic reviews to form the evidence basis for these recommendations. Compared with the 2007 guideline, there was no recommended change in step 1 (intermittent asthma) therapy (as-needed short-acting β2-agonists [SABAs] for rescue therapy). In step 2 (mild persistent asthma), either daily low-dose ICS plus as-needed SABA therapy or as-needed concomitant ICS and SABA therapy are recommended. Formoterol in combination with an ICS in a single inhaler (single maintenance and reliever therapy) is recommended as the preferred therapy for moderate persistent asthma in step 3 (low-dose ICS-formoterol therapy) and step 4 (medium-dose ICS-formoterol therapy) for both daily and as-needed therapy. A short-term increase in the ICS dose alone for worsening of asthma symptoms is not recommended. Add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists are recommended in individuals whose asthma is not controlled by ICS-formoterol therapy for step 5 (moderate-severe persistent asthma). Fractional exhaled nitric oxide testing is recommended to assist in diagnosis and monitoring of symptoms, but not alone to diagnose or monitor asthma. Allergen mitigation is recommended only in individuals with exposure and relevant sensitivity or symptoms. When used, allergen mitigation should be allergen specific and include multiple allergen-specific mitigation strategies. Subcutaneous immunotherapy is recommended as an adjunct to standard pharmacotherapy for individuals with symptoms and sensitization to specific allergens. Sublingual immunotherapy is not recommended specifically for asthma. Bronchial thermoplasty is not recommended as part of standard care; if used, it should be part of an ongoing research effort.

Conclusions and Relevance

Asthma is a common disease with substantial human and economic costs globally. Although there is no cure or established means of prevention, effective treatment is available. Use of the recommendations in the 2020 Asthma Guideline Update should improve the health of individuals with asthma.

Asthma guideline — SMART candidate selection and counseling indicates that no patient characteristics exclude consideration of this option in individuals aged 4 years and older with asthma; the studies demonstrating reduced exacerbations enrolled individuals with a severe exacerbation in the prior year and such individuals are particularly good candidates for SMART to reduce exacerbations; SMART might not be necessary for individuals whose asthma is well controlled on alternate treatments, such as conventional maintenance ICS-LABA with SABA as quick-relief therapy; the recommended alternate therapy of maintenance ICS-LABA with SABA as quick-relief therapy does not need to be changed if it is providing adequate control, but patients whose asthma is uncontrolled on such therapy should receive the preferred SMART if possible before moving to a higher step of therapy; clinicians should inform individuals and caregivers that studies consistently showed reductions in asthma exacerbations requiring unscheduled medical visits or systemic corticosteroids, improvement in asthma control and quality of life in some studies, no differences in harms versus ICS or ICS-LABA in individuals aged 12 years and older, and that reductions in exposure to oral corticosteroids and to ICS treatment in most studies suggest the intervention might reduce future corticosteroid-associated harms; in children aged 4 to 11 years, there may be a lower risk of growth suppression among those taking SMART versus daily higher-dose ICS treatment; this recommendation might not be appropriate for some individuals for reasons such as cost, formulary considerations, or medication intolerance.

Integration and stepwise approach — In Table IF, all of the Expert Panel's recommendations are grouped by the six priority topics, and the Expert Panel was asked to address specific questions about six priority topics rather than revise all of EPR-3 while recognizing the need to integrate the new evidence-based recommendations into a comprehensive approach to asthma care using the EPR-3 step diagrams. In preparing the step diagrams (Figs 2–4), the Expert Panel used some of the definitions and assumptions from EPR-3, and the step diagrams that follow this section retain the EPR-3 recommendations that the Expert Panel did not address in the current report.

For MART with budesonide–formoterol, "the maintenance dose may be increased to 100/6 mcg twice daily (metered dose; 80/4.5 mcg delivered dose)… this is still a low-dose regimen".

Asthma management cycle for personalized asthma care involves a continual cycle of assessment, adjustment of treatment and review. Assess the patient's symptom control and their risk factors for exacerbations, for decline in lung function and for medication adverse effects, with particular attention to inhaler technique and adherence; assess comorbidities and the patient's goals and preferences, and confirm the diagnosis of asthma if not yet done. Adjust the patient's management based on these assessments, including treatment of modifiable risk factors and comorbidities, relevant non-pharmacologic strategies, education and skills training, and adjustment of medication as required; for adults and adolescents, the preferred controller and reliever treatment across all steps is with combination ICS-formoterol, as shown in GINA Track 1. Review the patient in line with the goals of treatment, reassess factors affecting symptoms, risk of adverse outcomes and patient satisfaction, arrange further investigations if needed, and readjust treatment if needed.

In severe asthma, randomized controlled trial populations may not reflect clinical practice, with a registry study finding that over 80% of patients with severe asthma would have been excluded from major regulatory studies evaluating biologic therapy. If symptoms and/or exacerbations persist, additional treatment options may be considered, with a note to always check local eligibility and payer criteria.

Track 1 (preferred) has low-dose ICS–formoterol as the reliever at all steps: as needed only in Steps 1–2 (mild asthma), and with daily maintenance ICS–formoterol (maintenance-and-reliever therapy, "MART") in Steps 3–5. Track 2 (alternative) has as-needed SABA across all steps, plus regular ICS (Step 2) or ICS–long-acting β 2 -agonist (Steps 3–5). For adults with moderate-to-severe asthma, GINA makes additional recommendations in Step 5 for add-on long-acting muscarinic antagonists and azithromycin, with add-on biologic therapies for severe asthma. For children 6–11 years, new treatment options are added at Steps 3–4.

Across all age groups and levels of severity, regular personalized assessment, treatment of modifiable risk factors, self-management education, skills training, appropriate medication adjustment, and review remain essential to optimize asthma outcomes.

Asthma exacerbation follow-up and referral — after an exacerbation, the written asthma action plan should be reviewed, and maintenance asthma treatment can generally be reduced to previous levels 2–4 weeks after the exacerbation unless the history suggests long-term poorly controlled asthma, in which case a step up in treatment may be indicated. Patients with more than 1–2 exacerbations per year despite Step 4–5 therapy (or Step 4 therapy in children 6–11 years), or with several emergency department visits, should be referred to a specialist center, if available, for assessment and strategies to reduce their risk of future exacerbations and their risk of exposure to OCS.

Medications and strategies for adults, adolescents and children 6–11 years — For safety, GINA does not recommend treating asthma with short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) alone and states patients should receive inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)-containing treatment; ICS may be given as regular daily treatment or, in adults and adolescents with less-than-daily symptoms and normal or mildly reduced lung function, as as-needed low-dose ICS-formoterol for symptom relief, and for children not likely to be adherent with maintenance ICS the ICS can be taken whenever the child uses their SABA reliever; reduction in severe exacerbations is a high priority to lessen patient and health-system burden and the need for oral corticosteroids (OCS); tables of low, medium or high dose ICS do not represent equivalent potency and if a patient is switched between medications, they should be monitored for stability.

Asthma step-down — general principles: Consider stepping down when asthma symptoms have been well controlled and lung function has been stable for at least 3 months, choose an appropriate time (no respiratory infection, patient not travelling, not pregnant), approach each step as a therapeutic trial with documentation, action plan, monitoring and follow-up, and if risk factors such as a history of exacerbations or persistent airflow limitation are present, step down only with close supervision; stepping down inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) doses by 25–50% at 3-month intervals is feasible and safe for most patients.

### Initial step-up treatment changes in asthmatic children already prescribed inhaled corticosteroids: a historical cohort study [^18882b2c]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Asthma is a common conditionand 5% of children in the UK are prescribed inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) to control asthma symptoms. Annually there are over 25,000 children admitted to hospital for asthma in England and Walesand the cost of asthma inhaler prescriptions issued in the UK to children aged 5–15 years is ~£37million, which is equivalent to £5 for every child in the population. Treatment with low dose ICS is effective in controlling symptoms for the majority of children but ~10% of children require one of four additional 'step-up' treatment options. Clinical trials have demonstrated that many children will benefit from more than one step-up optionbut equally, some will gain greatest benefit from one of the options.

In the absence of evidence for a 'best' step-up option, guidelines for asthma management in children advocate either addition of LABA, or increasing ICS doseas the first step-up option while highlighting the need to assess response and prescribe an alternative treatment for non-responders. More recent guidance recommends that step-up to fixed dose combination inhaler (FDC) containing ICS and LABA is preferable to addition of separate LABA inhaler due to better adherence to a single inhaler device. What is not known is whether these guidelines, have been put into practice and our main research question was 'in what proportion of first step-up episodes is LABA treatment added to ICS rather than ICS dose increased or LTRA added?'. Given the uncertainty as to which initial treatment step-up is most effective, we anticipated that some children would be stepped up to treatment other than LABA and tested the null hypothesis that children stepped up to LTRA or increased ICS would be no different to those stepped up to LABA; the presence of differences between those stepped up to LABA and to other medications would suggest that prescribers recognise subgroups who they feel are more likely to respond to options other than LABA. We tested our research question and hypothesis using routinely acquired 'real life' data from primary care, an approach which complements results from clinical trialsand has been used in the paediatric settingand also, in adults, in the context of stepping up treatment.

Pharmacological management

The pharmacological management of asthma involves two key components: maintenance and reliever therapies. Maintenance therapies are the mainstay of asthma management, and the treatment aim is that no reliever therapies are required. Use of reliever therapy suggests asthma control is poor.

An overview of maintenance and reliever therapies is outlined in tables 3 and 4, respectively. A stepwise approach to asthma management is encouraged, and pharmacological management varies on age, symptom control and the national guideline used. An overview of management approach in a number of national guidelines is summarised in table 5.

Maintenance therapies

Reliever therapies

Summary of paediatric asthma national guidelines: focusing on management

Table 6
Biologic agents used in the management of asthma

GINA guidelines recommend dual ICS and short-acting beta-2 agonist (SABA) therapy to children over the age of 5.SABA monotherapy was previously the main management starting point; however, compared with combined treatment, SABA monotherapy has been shown to be associated with asthma mortality.SABA monotherapy is now only recommended by GINA for use in children aged 5 or less. As seen in table 5, GINA recommends symptom-driven ICS use, compared with daily ICS use, as initial therapy in children over 6 years of age. In comparison to daily ICS use, symptom-driven use has demonstrated a similar exacerbation risk and reduces the risk of ICS adverse effects.

Single maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART) inhalers are combined inhalers offering both maintenance and reliever therapy in those with asthma. These inhalers contain a number of maintenance and reliever therapies in different combinations. The use of these inhalers have been shown to reduce the risk of asthma attacks and emergency department (ED) admissions, improve lung function and decrease the need for reliever therapy. There is limited evidence in the effectiveness of SMART inhalers in children, but children over 12 years may be prescribed a SMART inhaler, which acts as both a maintenance and reliever therapy, if symptoms are not well controlled.

There are a number of biologic agents (table 6) that may be used in the management of paediatric asthma. These are endotype-specific, targeted therapies that should be used only under the supervision of specialists. Their availability and cost vary between countries and different healthcare systems. Detailed appraisal of the evidence base for their use is provided in the individual management guidelines and has been recently reviewed.

### An independent in-depth analysis proposing adjusted global initiative on asthma step 1–2 treatment suggestions [^2147b4a0]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2022). Medium credibility.

The Global Initiative on Asthma (GINA) strategy included major changes for the treatment of mild asthma in the 2020 version that are even taken to the next level in 2021, leaving a preferred track with only rescue therapy with inhaled corticosteroid and formoterol (ICS-FORM) for steps 1–2 in 12+ years old. It has been questioned how solid the evidence behind these recommendations is. We decided to independently conduct an in-depth analysis of published evidence based on a comprehensive evaluation of original articles and related appendices and publications, including quality of evidence and risk of bias per article. We first defined the major asthma treatment goals and proceeded to review how these were met in publications referenced in the main asthma guidelines. For patients with GINA (2021) Step 1 characteristics, the analysis supports GINA's decision to avoid SABA monotherapy and to prefer ICS-FORM rescue with an alternative ICS rescue every time a SABA is used for ≥ 12 years, even though evidence is extrapolated from step 2 patients. For 6- to 11-year-olds, we propose to consider ICS-FORM rescue as an alternative, as its use has been approved in this age group, be it not as rescue medication. For patients with GINA 2021 Step 2 characteristics, our proposal slightly differs from GINA 2021. We propose to continue avoiding the separate use of SABA, using ICS rescue whenever a fast-acting bronchodilator is taken (even with ICS maintenance). Also, the superiority of ICS-FORM rescue over classical step 2 treatment is not uniform and year-long experience is lacking. Consequently, for now, both treatment options seem equal: ICS-FORM rescue or ICS maintenance with SABA (+ICS) rescue. For 6- to 11-year-olds, ICS rescue every time a SABA is used has the advantage of lower total ICS dose; as alternative we suggest ICS-FORM rescue. The best treatment option depends on patient characteristics and treatment goals. Recommendations should be reviewed as soon as new evidence becomes available.

Asthma step-down to minimum effective treatment: Once good asthma control has been maintained for 2–3 months, consider stepping down gradually to find the lowest treatment that controls symptoms and exacerbations, provide a written asthma action plan, monitor closely with a follow-up visit, and do not completely withdraw ICS unless needed temporarily to confirm the diagnosis of asthma.

### 2020 focused updates to the asthma management guidelines: a Report from the national asthma education and prevention program coordinating committee expert panel working group [^b593eb25]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2020). Medium credibility.

The Expert Panel makes the following suggestions for implementation of daily and intermittent combination ICS-formoterol in individuals aged 4 years and older:
No patient characteristics exclude consideration of this option in individuals aged 4 years and older with asthma.
The studies demonstrating reduced exacerbations (see below) enrolled individuals with a severe exacerbation in the prior year. The results suggest that such individuals are particularly good candidates for SMART to reduce exacerbations.
SMART might not be necessary for individuals whose asthma is well controlled on alternate treatments, such as conventional maintenance ICS-LABA with SABA as quick-relief therapy.
SMART is appropriate for Step 3 (low-dose ICS-formoterol) and Step 4 (medium-dose ICS-formoterol) treatment.
ICS-formoterol should be administered as maintenance therapy with one to two puffs once to twice daily (depending on age, asthma severity, and ICS dose in the ICS formoterol preparation) and one to two puffs as needed for asthma symptoms. The maximum number of puffs per day is 12 (54 μg formoterol) for individuals aged 12 years and older and 8 (36 μg formoterol) for children aged 4 to 11 years. Clinicians should advise individuals with asthma or their caregivers to contact their physician if they need to use more than these amounts.
The calculation of the dose of formoterol was based on 4.5 μg/inhalation, the most common preparation used in the RCTs reviewed.
ICS-formoterol should not be used as quick-relief therapy in individuals taking ICS-salmeterol as maintenance therapy.
What clinicians should discuss with their patients and families: Clinicians should inform individuals with asthma and their caregivers that in studies, this intervention consistently reduced asthma exacerbations requiring unscheduled medical visits or systemic corticosteroids. In addition, this intervention improved asthma control and quality of life in some studies. No differences have been documented in harms between this type of therapy and the comparators (ICS or ICS-LABA) in individuals aged 12 years and older. The reductions in exposure to oral corticosteroids and to ICS treatment in most studies suggest that the intervention might reduce future corticosteroid associated harms. In children aged 4 to 11 years, there may be a lower risk of growth suppression among those taking SMART versus daily higher-dose ICS treatment. This recommendation might not be appropriate for some individuals with asthma for such reasons as cost, formulary considerations, or medication intolerance. However, the additional cost of the medication may be offset by the decrease in exacerbations and the associated improvement in quality of life and reduction in costs to both the patient and the payer. A 1-month supply of ICS-formoterol medication that is sufficient for maintenance therapy may not last a month if the inhaler is used for reliever therapy as well. Providers, individuals with asthma, pharmacists, and payers need to be aware of this possibility and prescribe, plan, dispense, or provide coverage accordingly.

GINA Steps for Children Aged 6–11

Treatment steps for children are shown in Figure 4 (Box 3-5B in Reference). In Step 1, for children with initial symptoms less than twice per month, taking ICS whenever SABA is taken for symptom relief is preferred over regular ICS or as-needed SABA alone. Regular, low-dose ICS with as-needed SABA is recommended in Step 2 for most children with asthma, but attention must be paid to adherence.

In Step 3, options include low-dose ICS–LABA, medium-dose ICS, or very-low-dose budesonide–formoterol MART. In Step 4, options include medium-dose ICS–LABA or low-dose MART (Table 1; Table E2 andin the online supplement). For all children at Step 4, consider referral for expert advice. In children, before stepping up, consider trying other controller options at the same step.

### Age-related differences in perceived asthma control in childhood: guidelines and reality [^0d34d0ff]. The European Respiratory Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Current guidelines specify the goals of asthma treatment in children and propose a stepwise approach to achieve them. The authors sought to determine whether these goals were attained in children of different age groups in the community and to assess treatment in those with unsatisfactory asthma control. A cross-sectional postal questionnaire survey was performed in 1998 in all members of the major Swiss parents organisation for childhood asthma. With a response rate of 85%, data from 572 Swiss-German children aged 4–16 yrs with wheeze were analysed. Asthma control was excellent in 18% of the children, satisfactory (only episodic symptoms) in 33%, and unsatisfactory in 49% with disturbed sleep, restricted activities and school absences. When stratified by age, excellent or satisfactory control was attained by 66% of children aged 13–16 yrs, but only by 56%, 44%, and 38% of those aged 10–12, 7–9 and 4–6 yrs, respectively. Although the majority were followed-up by a doctor (95%) and were receiving beta2-agonists (82%) and inhaled corticosteroids (68%), intensity and duration of treatment were not sufficiently matched to asthma severity. In virtually all children there was scope to improve medical treatment, preventive measures and knowledge of asthma management, with very few if any children with therapy-resistant asthma. Even in children with poor asthma control, 89% of parents were satisfied with the results of treatment. The goals of asthma treatment were attained in one-half of the children, particularly in younger age groups. Although inhaler use was common, detailed assessment showed evidence for undertreatment, especially in the youngest age group, and insufficient adherence to preventive measures. Parental expectations of asthma control, which were lower than those outlined in guidelines, might be an important but underestimated factor in paediatric asthma management.

### Real-life prescribing of asthmatic treatments in UK general practice over time using 2014 BTS / SIGN steps [^b37f1601]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The 2014 British Thoracic Society (BTS) and Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) guidelines recommend a stepwise approach to asthma management. We investigated the management of asthma in primary care in the UK to understand how real-world practice compares with BTS/SIGN guidelines. Asthma patients were identified from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink from September 2006 to August 2016. Aims were to classify patients according to BTS/SIGN steps, describe the proportion of patients transitioning between steps and describe patient demographics and clinical characteristics per group. Overall, 647,308 patients with asthma were identified (40,096 aged 5–11 years; 607,212 aged 12–80 years). Most treated patients were in step 1 or 2 (88.3% of children/67.5% of adults in December 2007; 83.0% of children/67.0% of adults in June 2016). Most patients remained within their treatment step within a 6-month interval (> 78% of children and adults throughout the study duration). The proportion of patients stepping up and down reduced from the beginning of the study, although stepping down to step 1 was relatively common in both adults and children. Few patients had a recorded asthma review in the year before reference date (18.8% of children and 14.8% of adults). Although prescribing patterns meant that most patients remained within their treatment step throughout the study, we cannot be sure that this was because their disease was truly stable. The small proportion of patients stepping up/down and the lack of recorded asthma review suggest that patients may not be treated in accordance with BTS/SIGN guidelines.

### Step-down from high dose fixed combination therapy in asthma patients: a randomized controlled trial [^fa8c151c]. Respiratory Research (2012). Low credibility.

Background

International guidelines recommend a stepwise approach for managing asthma in adults and children over 5 years of age. The Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA) guidelines indicate that "asthma control" is the objective of treatment, i.e. achieving and maintaining the control of symptoms and normal activity levels, maintaining pulmonary function as close to normal as possible, preventing asthma exacerbations and asthma mortality and avoiding adverse effects from asthma medications. Maintenance treatment should be stepped up or stepped down to the minimum amount of medication necessary to maintain asthma control and minimise the potential for long-term side effects.

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) represent the cornerstone of maintenance treatment. If asthma control is inadequate with low-dose ICS, the addition of a long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) provides enhanced clinical benefits compared to increasing the ICS dosage. ICS and LABAs have complementary clinical and pharmacological activities when administered together.

Although asthma guidelines advocate reducing treatment once asthma is well controlled, clinicians appear to be reluctant to reduce treatment. Both treatment prescription surveys and clinical trials indicate that a large proportion of asthmatic patients are over-treated and seldom stepped-down in clinical practice.

Relatively few studies have evaluated the best strategy for dose reduction. Some studies have documented a better maintenance of asthma control when the patients who are treated with ICS/LABA combination treatments were stepped down to a lower dose of the ICS/LABA combination, as opposed to suspending the LABA while maintaining the ICS at the same dose. This step-down strategy has the advantage of maintaining asthma control and lowering the dose of ICS. Conversely, 2 studies have shown that stepping-down from a low dose of ICS or the ICS/LABA combination to montelukast leads to a deterioration of asthma control. To date, no studies have assessed a treatment step-down to different drug combinations that are delivered by different inhaler devices (dry powder and pressurised metered dose inhalers).

### Real-life prescribing of asthmatic treatments in UK general practice over time using 2014 BTS / SIGN steps [^28f6a996]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

In the paediatric group, non-consecutive and consecutive steps were equally common (0.1–15.5% and 0.3–12.3%, respectively), and stepping down to step 1 from all other steps (particularly step 5) was a relatively common change. This suggests that paediatric patients do not always move through the treatment pathway in a stepwise manner. The most common non-consecutive steps were steps down (for example step 5–1, step 5–2, step 3–1 and step 4–1), suggesting that non-stepwise management is driven by step down, rather than step up. Although it is a relatively small number of patients, it is potentially concerning that children receiving step 5 therapy are being reduced from high dose ICS to no ICS, a strategy that is not in line with current guidelines. We also saw an increase in the number of patients in step 2 as the study progressed, with this becoming the most common step in the paediatric group by the end of the study. As the study design means that the average age of the population increased throughout the study duration, this may reflect an increase in confidence in prescribing ICS to children as they get older, although our study was not powered to detect differences by age within the cohorts. The adult group showed more stepwise movement than the paediatric group, with consecutive steps being more common than non-consecutive steps. However, as in the paediatric population, there seemed to be a preference for stepping down, particularly to step 1. The preference for stepping down to step 1, where patients are no longer receiving maintenance therapy, is interesting. This could reflect prescribers' intentions, or it could indicate that asthma patients stop requesting repeat prescriptions for maintenance therapy and only request reliever therapy once they are no longer symptomatic. Our study was not able to capture the impact of repeat vs. new prescriptions, so we can only speculate on this point, although previous research has noted a reluctance to use maintenance therapy among asthma patients when symptoms were absent, which would fit with this suggestion. The time period of 6 months used to assign treatment steps was chosen to capture all likely ways in which patients could be prescribed combinations of therapy; therefore the multiple steps down seen are likely to reflect clinical practice, rather than being a result of data recording. It would be interesting to follow patients who stepped down multiple steps at a time to see if they experienced worse outcomes, or if they remained stable afterwards. However, this was outside the scope of our current study.

### Treatment patterns and related clinical consequences in adults with asthma [^19a409c8]. The Journal of Asthma (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

A stepwise therapeutic management is recommended for asthma patients by the Global Initiative for Asthma (GINA). Little is known about the recommendations applied in real world settings. This study aims to associate Treatment step with clinical events in patients with mild or severe asthma.

Methods

A retrospective claims database analysis included adult patients with mild (GINA step 1) or severe asthma (GINA step 4). Maximum Treatment Step was measured within the first and second 90-day period after index date (the first date of asthma diagnosis during the inclusion period). Step-down was defined as a Treatment Step change from a higher to lower step, while Step-up was defined as a Treatment Step change from a lower to higher step. The primary outcome was a composite endpoint of asthma-related clinical events, measured at the third 90-day period.

Results and Conclusions

A total of 6,354 mild-asthma patients and 5,695 severe-asthma patients were included. In mild-asthma, when compared with No Change in Treatment Step, Step-down was associated with a lower risk of future clinical events [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.80, 95% confidence interval (95% CI); 0.69–0.94], while Step-up was not associated with a change in clinical events [OR 0.98, 95% CI: 0.77–1.27]. In severe-asthma patients, Step-down was not associated with a change in clinical events [OR 0.94, 95% CI: 0.81–1.10], while Step-up was associated with a higher risk of future clinical events [OR 2.07, 95% CI: 1.29–3.33]. Our findings reassure the appropriateness of stepping-down treatment in mild-asthma patients. Clinicians should closely monitor and/or provide detailed asthma action plans for severe-asthma patients who are stepping-up treatment.

Individuals ages 12+ years — Use SABA as needed for symptoms. The intensity of treatment depends on the severity of symptoms; up to 3 treatments at 20-minute intervals as needed. In steps 3 and 4, the preferred option includes the use of ICS-formoterol 1 to 2 puffs as needed up to a maximum total daily maintenance and rescue dose of 12 puffs (54 mcg). Caution: Increasing use of SABA or use > 2 days a week for symptom relief (not prevention of EIB) generally indicates inadequate control and may require a step up in treatment.

### Comparison of national and global asthma management guiding documents [^9dc37e6c]. Respiratory Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Asthma is a common chronic disease that affects both adults and children, and that continues to have a high economic burden. Asthma management guidelines were first developed nearly 30 years ago to standardize care, maintain asthma control, improve quality of life, maintain normal lung function, prevent exacerbations, and prevent asthma mortality. The two most common asthma guidelines used today were developed by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) Expert Panel Working Group and the Global Initiative for Asthma Science Committee. Both guiding documents use scientific methodology to standardize their approach for formulating recommendations based on pertinent literature. Before the 2020 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (Expert Panel Report 4), nothing had been released since the 2007 guidelines, whereas the Global Initiative for Asthma publishes updates annually. Although each of these asthma strategies is similar, there are some noted differences. Over the years, the focus of asthma treatment has shifted from acute to chronic management. Frontline respiratory therapists and other health-care providers should have a good understanding of these 2 guiding references and how they can impact acute and chronic asthma management. The primary focus of this narrative is to look at the similarities and differences of these 2 guiding documents as they pertain to the 6 key questions identified by the Expert Panel of the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program.

Clinician's Summary:

In individuals aged 12 years and older, the preferred Step 4 therapy is single-inhaler ICS-formoterol used both daily and as needed. The maximum total daily dose of formoterol should not exceed 12 puffs (54 μg) for those aged 12 years and older. The recommended alternate therapy of maintenance ICS-LABA along with SABA as quick-relief therapy does not need to be changed if it is providing adequate control. However, individuals whose asthma is uncontrolled on such therapy should receive the preferred SMART if possible before stepping up their treatment to a higher step of therapy.

In individuals aged 12 years and older with moderate to severe persistent asthma, combination ICS-formoterol used daily and intermittently is more beneficial than an increase in the daily ICS dose if they are already taking combination ICS-LABA (and as needed SABA). The Expert Panel makes the following suggestions for implementation of daily and intermittent combination ICS-formoterol for individuals aged 12 years and older:
This recommendation applies to all individuals with asthma aged 12 years and older.
Individuals with asthma should use ICS-formoterol as maintenance therapy with one to two puffs once or twice daily (depending on asthma severity and ICS dose in the ICS-formoterol preparation). The additional rescue dose is 1 to 2 puffs as needed for asthma symptoms, up to a maximum of 12 puffs (54 μg formoterol) per day. Clinicians should advise individuals with asthma to contact their clinician if they need to use more than these amounts.
The calculation of the dose of formoterol was based on 4.5 μg/inhalation, the most common preparation used in the RCTs reviewed.
Clinicians managing asthma should regularly assess individuals using this therapy.
This therapy is appropriate for Step 4.
Individuals with asthma should not use ICS-formoterol as reliever therapy if they are taking ICS-salmeterol as maintenance therapy.
SMART might not be necessary for individuals whose asthma is well controlled with alternate treatments, such as conventional maintenance ICS-LABA with SABA as quick-relief therapy.
For individuals aged 5 to 11 years, the evidence was insufficient to make a recommendation regarding SMART compared to higher-dose ICS-LABA. SMART with low- or medium-dose ICS therapy is preferred for children aged 5 to 11 years as opposed to same-, low-, or medium-dose ICS-LABA plus as-needed SABA as part of Step 3 and Step 4 therapy (Recommendation 12).
What clinicians should discuss with their patients and families: Clinicians should inform individuals with asthma and their caregivers that the major demonstrated benefits of combination ICS-formoterol used daily and as needed are reductions in asthma exacerbations requiring unscheduled medical visits and in use of systemic corticosteroids. Clinicians should also inform individuals with asthma that studies found no difference in documented harms between this type of therapy and daily ICS-LABA. Studies showed that combination ICS-formoterol reduces exposure to corticosteroids, suggesting that the intervention might reduce future corticosteroid associated harms.

Ages 5–11 years quick-relief medications — Use inhaled short-acting beta2-agonist (SABA) as needed for symptoms; the intensity of treatment depends on severity of symptoms, up to 3 treatments at 20-minute intervals as needed. In Steps 3 and 4, the preferred option includes ICS-formoterol 1 to 2 puffs as needed up to a maximum total daily maintenance and rescue dose of 8 puffs (36 mcg). Caution: Increasing use of SABA or use > 2 days a week for symptom relief (not prevention of EIB) generally indicates inadequate control and may require a step up in treatment.

### Intermittent versus daily inhaled corticosteroids for persistent asthma in children and adults [^258e08ce]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Daily inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the recommended mainstay of treatment in children and adults with persistent asthma. However, often, ICS are used intermittently by patients or recommended by physicians to be used only at the onset of exacerbations.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to compare the efficacy and safety of intermittent versus daily ICS in the management of children and adults with persistent asthma and preschool-aged children suspected of persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (CAGR) and the ClinicalTrials.gov web site up to October 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared intermittent ICS versus daily ICS in children and adults with persistent asthma. No co-interventions were permitted other than rescue relievers and oral corticosteroids used during exacerbations.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, methodological quality and extracted data. The primary efficacy outcome was the number of patients with one or more exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids and the primary safety outcome was the number of patients with serious adverse health events. Secondary outcomes included exacerbations, lung function tests, asthma control, adverse effects, withdrawal rates and inflammatory markers. Equivalence was assumed if the risk ratio (RR) estimate and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were between 0.9 and 1.1. Quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE.

Main Results

Six trials (including one trial testing two relevant protocols) met the inclusion criteria for a total of seven group comparisons. The four paediatric trials (two involving preschool children and two school-aged children) and two adult parallel-group trials, lasting 12 to 52 weeks, were of high methodological quality. A total of 1211 patients with confirmed, or suspected, persistent asthma contributed to the meta-analyses. There was no statistically significant group difference in the risk of patients experiencing one or more exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (1204 patients; RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.32; the large confidence interval translates into a risk of exacerbations in the intermittent ICS group varying between 17% and 25%, assuming a 19% risk with daily ICS). Age, severity of airway obstruction, step-up protocol used during exacerbations and trial duration did not significantly influence the primary efficacy outcome. No group difference was observed in the risk of patients with serious adverse health events (1055 patients; RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.33 to 2.03). Compared to the daily ICS group, the intermittent ICS group displayed a smaller improvement in change from baseline peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) by 2.56% (95% CI -4.49% to -0.63%), fewer symptom-free days (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.15 (95% CI -0.28 to -0.03), fewer asthma control days -9% (95% CI -14% to -4%), more use of rescue β2-agonists by 0.12 puffs/day (95% CI 0 to 0.23) and a greater increase from baseline in exhaled nitric oxide of 16.80 parts per billion (95% CI 11.95 to 21.64). There was no significant group difference in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), quality of life, airway hyper-reactivity, adverse effects, hospitalisations, emergency department visits or withdrawals. In paediatric trials, intermittent ICS (budesonide and beclomethasone) were associated with greater growth by 0.41 cm change from baseline (532 children; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.69) compared to daily treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

In children and adults with persistent asthma and in preschool children suspected of persistent asthma, there was low quality evidence that intermittent and daily ICS strategies were similarly effective in the use of rescue oral corticosteroids and the rate of severe adverse health events. The strength of the evidence means that we cannot currently assume equivalence between the two options. Daily ICS was superior to intermittent ICS in several indicators of lung function, airway inflammation, asthma control and reliever use. Both treatments appeared safe, but a modest growth suppression was associated with daily, compared to intermittent, inhaled budesonide and beclomethasone. Clinicians should carefully weigh the potential benefits and harm of each treatment option, taking into account the unknown long-term (> one year) impact of intermittent therapy on lung growth and lung function decline.

Overview of key questions and recommendations for intermittent ICS use

Given the range of options for intermittent ICS dosing and the number of comparisons embedded in the three key questions for this priority topic, the Expert Panel made five recommendations for intermittent ICS use to address these key questions. The majority of the studies in the systematic review reporton this topic used comparative efficacy designs as opposed to comparative effectiveness designs.

Table IV provides an overview of the questions on this topic, interventions and comparators that the Expert Panel considered, and resulting recommendations. As shown, in the opinion of the Expert Panel, the evidence was insufficient to support recommendations for all of the comparators in the questions.

In the remainder of this section, each key question is followed by recommendations that are relevant to the question, the evidence that supports the recommendation, and guidance for implementing each recommendation. The Expert Panel did not address the efficacy and safety of the following types of intermittent ICS treatment because they were not mentioned in the key questions:
As-needed ICS-formoterol versus as-needed SABA in Step 1 (intermittent asthma) or Steps 5 and 6 (severe asthma) treatment (Figs 2–4)
As-needed ICS-formoterol versus low-dose ICS treatment and as-needed SABA in Step 2 (mild persistent asthma) treatment (Figs 2–4)

Question 4.1

What is the comparative effectiveness of intermittent ICS compared to no treatment, pharmacologic therapy, or nonpharmacologic therapy in children aged 0 to 4 years with recurrent wheezing?

Recommendation 9: In children aged 0 to 4 years with recurrent wheezing triggered by respiratory tract infections and no wheezing between infections, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends starting a short course of daily ICS at the onset of a respiratory tract infection with as-needed SABA for quick-relief therapy compared to as-needed SABA for quick-relief therapy only.

Intermittent ICS use — background, scope, and key questions: Scheduled, daily ICS treatment is the currently preferred pharmacologic controller therapy for persistent asthma in individuals of all ages, and although intermittent ICS dosing schedules may be useful in some settings, prior evidence was insufficient to support a recommendation in favor of this treatment beyond expert consensus; in this update, given the range of options and the number of comparisons embedded in the three key questions for this priority topic, the Expert Panel made five recommendations, with most studies using comparative efficacy designs and with evidence insufficient to support recommendations for all of the comparators; additionally, the Expert Panel did not address the efficacy and safety of types of intermittent ICS treatment not mentioned in the key questions, specifically as-needed ICS-formoterol versus as-needed SABA in Step 1 (intermittent asthma) or Steps 5 and 6 (severe asthma) treatment.

### Asthma: updated diagnosis and management recommendations… [^741f8255]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- As-needed SABA therapy alone is not recommended because of severe exacerbations and mortality risks.
- As-needed use of a low-dose ICS/formoterol combination is preferred in adolescents and adults with mild asthma.
- As-needed use of a low-dose ICS and a SABA is preferred in children six to 11 years of age with mild asthma. Treatment Asthma severity is defined by the treatment required to control symptoms and exacerbations. Well-controlled asthma involves daytime symptoms or as-needed medication use twice a week or less, no activity limitation, and no waking with symptoms. Severity is assessed after several months of regular controller treatment. Mild: Asthma is well controlled with step 1 or 2 treatment. Options for children six to 11 years of age include using a low-dose ICS as needed for symptoms with a SABA or a daily low-dose ICS with a SABA as needed. When symptoms are infrequent, adherence to daily therapy is often poor.

STEP 2 Preferred step 2 controller options in adults and adolescents include a daily low-dose ICS plus a SABA as needed or low-dose ICS/formoterol as needed. Leukotriene receptor antagonists are less effective but can be considered for patients who are unable or unwilling to use an ICS or who have concomitant allergic rhinitis. The preferred step 2 controller for children six to 11 years of age is a daily low-dose ICS plus a SABA as needed. Less effective options include a daily leukotriene receptor antagonist or using a low-dose ICS as needed with a SABA. STEP 3 Options in adults and adolescents include low-dose ICS/long-acting beta 2-agonist as daily treatment with a SABA as needed, or low-dose ICS/formoterol as both daily treatment and as needed. In children six to 11 years of age, either a medium-dose ICS or a low-dose ICS/LABA combination should be used as a controller, with a SABA as needed.

STEP 4 Preferred options for adults and adolescents include a low-dose ICS/formoterol as both daily and as-needed treatment or a medium-dose ICS/LABA as daily maintenance treatment with a SABA as needed. The addition of sublingual allergen immunotherapy may be considered in adults with allergic rhinitis and suboptimally controlled asthma despite ICS therapy. Referral is recommended for children six to 11 years of age if asthma is not controlled with a medium-dose ICS.

GINA Treatment Steps for Adults and Adolescents

Steps 1 and 2, Preferred Treatment (Track 1)

The preferred treatment for adults and adolescents with mild asthma is low-dose ICS–formoterol taken as needed for symptom relief, without maintenance treatment (Figure 3). As-needed-only ICS–formoterol is usually prescribed with a budesonide–formoterol inhaler providing a metered dose of 200/6 μg per inhalation (equivalent to a delivered dose of 160/4.5 μg), with one inhalation taken as needed for symptom relief (Table 1; for dosage details, see Table E2 and thein the online supplement). Other combination ICS–formoterol products may be suitable but have not yet been studied.

Rationale

Considerations for the recommendations at Steps 1 and 2 are interrelated. In patients eligible for Step 2 treatment, two large studies found that as-needed ICS–formoterol reduced the risk of severe exacerbations by almost two-thirds compared with SABA-only treatment. Four studies (∼10,000 patients) showed a similar or greater reduction in severe exacerbations compared with daily low-dose ICS, without clinically important differences in symptom control, lung function, or airway inflammation measured by F NO over 12 months. The primary outcome variable of one study was "well-controlled asthma weeks", but this outcome was not considered reliable because it was based on a past definition of asthma control and was systematically biased against the as-needed ICS–formoterol treatment group, in which patients were permitted much less ICS than those on maintenance ICS before a week was classified as not well controlled. In two studies that showed a greater overall reduction in the risk of severe exacerbations with as-needed ICS–formoterol compared with maintenance ICS plus as-needed SABA, no predictors of differential response were identified among many baseline characteristics, including inflammatory phenotype, except for a clinically unimportant difference in the five-item Asthma Control Questionnaire in one study.

Difficult-to-Treat and Severe Asthma in Adults and Adolescents

Detailed information is provided in the GINA 2021 pocket guide on difficult-to-treat and severe asthma, including an integrated decision tree for diagnosis and management across primary and specialist care. A brief summary is included below.

Assessment and Optimization of Therapy

Difficult-to-treat asthma is asthma that is uncontrolled despite medium- or high-dose ICS–LABA treatment or that requires high-dose ICS–LABA treatment to maintain good symptom control and reduce exacerbations.

Severe asthma is asthma that is uncontrolled despite good adherence with optimized high-dose ICS–LABA therapy and management of contributory factors or that worsens when high-dose treatment is decreased. Approximately 3–10% of people with asthma have severe asthma.

Assess all patients with difficult-to-treat asthma to confirm the diagnosis of asthma and to identify and manage factors that commonly contribute to symptoms, poor quality of life, and/or exacerbations. For patients with persistent symptoms and/or exacerbations despite high-dose ICS–LABA, assess the clinical and inflammatory phenotype, as this may guide the selection of add-on treatment. Refer for expert advice if asthma does not improve in response to optimizing Step 4 or 5 treatment (or earlier, if needed).

Steps 1 and 2, Alternative Treatment (Track 2)

The alternative (non-preferred) Step 2 recommendation for adults and adolescents remains regular, low-dose ICS with as-needed SABA. The Step 1 recommendation is taking ICS whenever SABA is taken (combination or separate inhalers).

Rationale

For patients with initial symptoms twice per month or more, low-dose maintenance ICS reduces the risk of serious exacerbations by almost half compared with SABA alone. There is a paucity of evidence for the safety and effectiveness of as-needed concomitant ICS + SABA, as only small groups received this regimen in studies of adults and children 5–18 years. However, concomitant ICS + SABA would be preferable to using SABA alone if ICS–formoterol is not available or affordable. No data are available about the acceptability to adults of carrying separate ICS and SABA inhalers for symptom relief or on what proportion of patients would revert to SABA-only use. No data are available about safe levels of as-needed ICS + SABA use, but in one study, exacerbations were higher among patients randomized to twice-daily ICS–SABA than among those on as-needed ICS–SABA, consistent with risks associated with SABA overuse.

Steps 3 and 4

The preferred Step 3 treatment is maintenance-and-reliever therapy (MART) with low-dose ICS–formoterol, which is approved in many countries with budesonide–formoterol and beclometasone–formoterol. For Step 4, if needed, the maintenance dose of ICS–formoterol can be increased to medium. The doses of ICS–formoterol recommended for MART, including the maximum dose in any day, are shown in Table E2 and thein the online supplement.

Rationale

In adults and adolescents with poor symptom control and one or more exacerbations in the previous year, MART reduced exacerbations and provided similar symptom control at relatively low ICS doses, compared with maintenance ICS–LABA or higher-dose ICS, both with as-needed SABA (,–). In open-label studies in broader populations, MART also significantly reduced severe exacerbations, with a lower average dose of ICS. ICS–formoterol should not be used as the reliever for patients taking maintenance nonformoterol ICS–LABA because there are no data for efficacy and safety.

### Intermittent versus daily inhaled corticosteroids for persistent asthma in children and adults [^25872990]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Daily inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the recommended mainstay of treatment in children and adults with persistent asthma. Yet often, ICS are used intermittently by patients or recommended by physicians to be used only at the onset of exacerbations.

Objectives

The aim of this review was to compare the efficacy and safety of intermittent versus daily ICS in the management of children and adults with persistent asthma and preschool-aged children suspected of persistent asthma.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (CAGR) and the ClinicalTrials.gov website up to December 2011.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared intermittent ICS versus daily ICS in children and adults with persistent asthma. No co-interventions were permitted other than rescue relievers and oral corticosteroids used during exacerbations.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, methodological quality and extracted data. The primary efficacy outcome was the number of patients with one or more exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids and the primary safety outcome was the number of patients with serious adverse health events. Secondary outcomes included exacerbations, lung function tests, asthma control, adverse effects, withdrawal rates and inflammatory markers. Equivalence was assumed if the risk ratio (RR) estimate and its 95% confidence interval (CI) were between 0.9 and 1.1.

Main Results

Six trials (including one trial testing two relevant protocols) met the inclusion criteria for a total of seven group comparisons. The four paediatric trials (two involving preschool children and two school-aged children) and two adult parallel-group trials, lasting 12 to 52 weeks, were of high methodological quality. A total of 1211 patients with confirmed, or suspected, persistent asthma contributed to the meta-analyses. There was no statistically significant group difference in the risk of patients experiencing one or more exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids (1204 patients; RR 1.07; 95% CI 0.87 to 1.32). The patients' age, severity of airway obstruction, step-up protocol used during exacerbations and trial duration did not significantly influence the primary efficacy outcome. No group difference was observed in the risk of patients with serious adverse health events (1055 patients; RR 0.82; 95% CI 0.33 to 2.03). Compared to the daily ICS group, the intermittent ICS group displayed a smaller improvement in change from baseline peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) by 2.56% (95% CI -4.49% to -0.63%), fewer symptom-free days (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.15 (95% CI -0.28 to -0.03), fewer asthma control days -9% (95% CI -14% to -4%), more use of rescue β(2)-agonists by 0.12 puffs/day (95% CI 0 to 0.23) and a greater increase from baseline in exhaled nitric oxide of 16.80 parts per billion (95% CI 11.95 to 21.64). There was no significant group difference in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)), quality of life, airway hyper-reactivity, adverse effects, hospitalisations, emergency department visits or withdrawals. In paediatric trials, intermittent ICS (budesonide and beclomethasone) were associated with greater growth by 0.41 cm change from baseline (532 children; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.69) compared to daily treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

In children and adults with persistent asthma and in preschool children suspected of persistent asthma, intermittent and daily ICS strategies did not significantly differ in the use of rescue oral corticosteroids and the rate of severe adverse health events, neither did they reach equivalence. Daily ICS was superior to intermittent ICS in several indicators of lung function, airway inflammation, asthma control and reliever use. Both treatments appeared safe, but a modest growth suppression was associated with daily, compared to intermittent, inhaled budesonide and beclomethasone. The clinician should carefully weigh the potential benefits and harm of each treatment option, taking into account the unknown long-term (> one year) impact of intermittent therapy on lung growth and lung function decline.

Future research opportunities

The Expert Panel offers the following suggestions for future research:
Comparative effectiveness studies of LAMA therapy for asthma. Because the majority of LAMA studies were efficacy studies, the clinical impact of LAMA treatment in real-world settings is not well understood.
Comparative effectiveness and safety of ICS plus LAMA versus ICS-LABA in ethnically diverse population in studies that are adequately powered to examine the harms and benefits of these two treatment options.
Systematic reviews in children with asthma aged 6 to 11 years to inform future guidelines.
Comparisons of a LAMA to a leukotriene inhibitor as add-on therapy to ICS-LABA in individuals with uncontrolled persistent asthma.
Role of LAMAs other than tiotropium as add-on therapy to ICS therapy in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma.

Future research opportunities — The Expert Panel identified topics that would benefit from additional research. Priorities include differences by race and ethnicity in benefits and risks of the ICS recommendations and the cost-effectiveness of the ICS recommendations. Additional comparative work includes daily low-dose ICS with SABA for quick relief versus as-needed ICS plus SABA administered concomitantly in children aged 4 to 11 years with mild persistent asthma and additional studies powered as equivalence studies to confirm whether daily low-dose ICS with SABA for quick relief and concomitant as-needed ICS plus SABA lead to similar outcomes in individuals with mild persistent asthma. Real-world studies that monitor growth in children and adherence to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of quadrupling the ICS dose in individuals with mild to moderate persistent asthma taking daily ICS controller therapy who experience early signs of loss of asthma control are also identified.

### Severe asthma in childhood: diagnostic and management challenges [^897b88f3]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Problematic severe asthma is a heterogeneous disease with multiple phenotypes. It is rare (< 5% of children with asthma), but accounts for 30–50% of all pediatric asthma healthcare costs. This review looks into the currently used management strategies and the innovative treatments, considering both conventional medications and innovative biological therapies for targeting airway inflammation.

Recent Findings

Patients with problematic severe asthma should be seen by pediatric asthma specialists using a stepwise approach. The first step is to exclude alternative diagnoses; the second is to consider and exclude comorbidities, and assess adherence to medication; the third step involves identifying the pattern of inflammation; and response to treatment in the fourth. Innovative biological therapies are emerging and healthcare professionals should know how to handle them. Patient phenotyping is the main step towards a targeted therapeutic strategy.

Summary

A careful management is important for children with severe asthma, who form a small but challenging group of patients. More research efforts are needed to enable a personalized medicine and a biomarker-driven approach.

Rationale and discussion

Outcomes did not differ in the groups treated with the two alternate regimens in the three studies, in individuals aged 12 years and older. However, because none of these studies was powered as an equivalence study, the Expert Panel made a conditional recommendation. Although the studies had high certainty of evidence for asthma control and quality of life, they had low certainty of evidence for exacerbations and, taken together, resulted in over all low certainty for the recommendation statement. The Expert Panel made no recommendation based on this comparison for children aged 4to 11 years because the only small included study in this population had low certainty of evidence, and one additional study had a study design that precluded evaluation for this key question.

Recommendation 11: In individuals aged 4 years and older with mild to moderate persistent asthma who are likely to be adherent to daily ICS treatment, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends against a short-term increase in the ICS dose for increased symptoms or decreased peak flow.

Conditional recommendation, low certainty of evidence

Implementation guidance

Clinician's Summary:

This recommendation addresses temporary increases in the dose of an ICS that is otherwise taken as controller therapy in response to worsening asthma. For this recommendation, a short-term increase in ICS dose refers to a doubling, quadrupling, or quintupling of the regular daily dose. For individuals aged 4 years and older with mild to moderate persistent asthma who are likely to adhere to their daily ICS treatment, the Expert Panel does not recommend doubling, quadrupling, or quintupling the ICS dose for increased symptoms or decreased peak flow. Clinicians can consider quadrupling the regular daily dose for individuals aged 16 years and older whose adherence to daily therapy is not assured (see the Discussion section below).

SECTION V: RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE USE OF LAMAs FOR ASTHMA

Background

LAMAs comprise a pharmacologic class of long-acting bronchodilators. The role of LAMAs in the management of asthma was not addressed in Expert Panel Report 3: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma. Since that report's publication in 2007, several trials have investigated LAMAs as controller therapy for individuals with asthma.

The Expert Panel examined the harms and benefits of LAMAs in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma and addressed three key questions. The Expert Panel did not examine the role of LAMA treatment in children aged 6 to 11 years because the key questions and systematic reviews did not address this age group. With the exception of one study that examined the LAMA umeclidinium, the RCTs reviewed by the Expert Panel used tiotropium bromide as the LAMA. At the time this report was written, tiotropium bromide (Respimat) was the only formulation of LAMA with US FDA approval for asthma treatment. The majority of LAMA studies used a comparative efficacy design, and not an effectiveness design, but the key questions were about effectiveness. Therefore, the clinical impact of LAMA treatment in real-world settings is not well understood. Table V provides an overview of the key questions and recommendations on LAMAs.

Definitions of terms used in this section

In this section, "controller therapy" refers to medications that are taken daily on a long-term basis to achieve and maintain control of persistent asthma. The term "ICS-LABA" indicates therapy with both an ICS and a LABA, usually (and preferably) in a single inhaler.

Question 5.1

What is the comparative effectiveness of LAMA compared with other controller therapy as add-on therapy to ICSs in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma?

Question 5.2

What is the comparative effectiveness of LAMA as add-on therapy to ICS controller therapy compared with placebo or increased ICS dose in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma?

Recommendation 14: In individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends against adding LAMA to ICS compared to adding LABA to ICS.

Conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence

Recommendation 15: If LABA is not used, in individuals aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled persistent asthma, the Expert Panel conditionally recommends adding LAMA to ICS controller therapy compared to continuing the same dose of ICS alone.

Conditional recommendation, moderate certainty of evidence

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^d2ac91a8]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Children 5 years and younger — indications to start controller therapy and manage diagnostic uncertainty: If history and symptoms suggest asthma with uncontrolled respiratory symptoms and/or frequent wheezing, and wheezing episodes are frequent (e.g., three or more episodes in a season), regular controller treatment (usually maintenance low-dose inhaled corticosteroid [ICS]) should be initiated and the response evaluated. Regular ICS treatment may also be indicated for less frequent but more severe viral-induced wheeze. If the diagnosis is in doubt and inhaled short-acting beta2 agonist (SABA) therapy or antibiotics are needed more than every 6–8 weeks, a trial of regular ICS treatment should be considered and referral for specialist opinion should also be considered. Regarding growth, effects of ICS on growth velocity are seen in the first 1–2 years of treatment, are not progressive or cumulative, and one long-term study showed a difference of only 0.7% in adult height.

### Asthma across childhood: improving adherence to asthma management from early childhood to adolescence [^1b0de6a4]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). Medium credibility.

Asthma affects nearly 6 million US children. Throughout childhood, children undergo a series of biological, developmental, and psychosocial changes. Thus, factors influencing a child's asthma management differ across 3 essential stages-early childhood (0–5 years), school-aged years (5–12 years), and adolescence (12–18 years)-and require varied intervention by parents, school personnel, clinicians, and the children themselves. Because asthma care in children is characterized by fluctuations in severity and coordination among many stakeholders, optimal asthma control is difficult to achieve in this young population. Challenges in childhood asthma management are reflected in the low rates of children's adherence to medication regimes. Although pharmacological and biological factors addressing age in physicians' treatment choices are well outlined, age-specific approaches to patient-provider communication and asthma-related interventions are also important in improving quality of life for patients with pediatric asthma.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^28ea7dad]. GINA (2024). High credibility.

Not recommended options and cautions in children 6–11 years — SABA-only treatment is not recommended in children 6–11 years, as for adults and adolescents; children whose asthma is treated with SABA alone (compared with ICS) are at increased risk of asthma-related death (Evidence A) and urgent asthma-related health care (Evidence A), even if they have good symptom control, and in children, dispensing of three or more SABA inhalers in a year is associated with a doubling of risk of emergency department presentation. Oral SABA and theophylline are not recommended because of the higher risk of side-effects and lower efficacy, and no long-term safety studies have been performed to assess the risk of severe exacerbations associated with oral SABA or theophylline use in children not also taking ICS. The rapid-onset LABA, formoterol, is as effective as SABA as a reliever medication in children as well as in adults and reduces the risk of severe exacerbations by 15–45% compared with as-needed SABA, but use of regular or frequent LABA without ICS is strongly discouraged because of the risk of exacerbations (Evidence A).

### Comparing LAMA with LABA and LTRA as add-on therapies in primary care asthma management [^e1a26ec1]. NPJ Primary Care Respiratory Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The Global Initiative for Asthma recommends a stepwise approach to adjust asthma treatment to the needs of individual patients; inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) remain the core pharmacological treatment. However, many patients remain poorly controlled, and evidence-based algorithms to decide on the best order and rationale for add-on therapies are lacking. We explore the challenges of asthma management in primary care and review outcomes from randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses comparing the long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) tiotropium with long-acting β 2 -agonists (LABAs) or leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) as add-on to ICS in patients with asthma. In adults, LAMAs and LABAs provide a greater improvement in lung function than LTRAs as add-on to ICS. In children, results were positive and comparable between therapies, but data are scarce. This information could aid decision-making in primary care, supporting the use of add-on therapy to ICS to help improve lung function, control asthma symptoms and prevent exacerbations.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^3b09c8ec]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for asthma, more specifically with respect to initial assessment, GINA 2025 guidelines recommend to assess symptom control, future risk of adverse outcomes, and treatment issues in adult, adolescent, and pediatric (aged 6–11 years) patients presenting with asthma:

- assess symptom control over the last 4 weeks or longer

- identify any other risk factors for exacerbations, persistent airflow limitation, or side-effects

- measure lung function at diagnosis/initiation of treatment, 3–6 months after starting ICS-containing treatment, then periodically (at least once every 1–2 years), but more often in at-risk patients and patients with severe asthma

- document the patient's current treatment step

- watch inhaler technique, assess adherence and side-effects

- check that the patient has a written asthma action plan

- ask about the patient's attitudes and goals for their asthma and medications

- assess multimorbidity contributing to symptoms and poor QoL, and sometimes to poor asthma control (such as rhinitis, rhinosinusitis, GERD, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, depression, and anxiety).
