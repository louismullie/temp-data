## Question

Labs for tic disorder

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about which laboratory tests are appropriate in the evaluation of tic disorders and when they should be considered. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether a routine evaluation or a targeted workup is warranted. Then, I should verify the red flags that mandate additional medical testing. Next, I will outline a baseline laboratory package for new-onset or atypical tics. After that, I need to check which optional tests may be considered based on suspicion of specific secondary causes. Then, I will examine pharmacologic scenarios that require lab monitoring. I should also confirm what tests to avoid routinely, including EEG and brain imaging. Finally, I will consider how comorbidities influence lab choices and summarize the key principles to guide decisions, anchoring to AACAP and AAN guidance as I go.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle: routine laboratory testing is not required for a straightforward, classic primary tic disorder presentation. The diagnosis remains clinical, guided by DSM criteria and careful phenomenology, and in isolated tics without atypical features, further diagnostic testing is generally unnecessary [^116SBX1m] [^115hBz5w].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — some presentations do warrant a medical workup. I need to check for red flags such as new-onset tics, sudden severe onset, atypical phenomenology, or mental status changes suggestive of an organic process, and I should also remember that a new or abrupt exacerbation in the context of suspected intercurrent illness merits infection screening; in these situations, targeted labs are reasonable and sometimes necessary [^1179XJYW].

> For new-onset or atypical tics, I should confirm a reasonable baseline panel to exclude common medical contributors. A standard approach includes a complete blood count, a renal and hepatic function panel, a thyroid-stimulating hormone, and ferritin; for adolescents, a urine drug screen is also reasonable, given medication and substance exposures that can mimic or worsen tics, and this constellation aligns with AACAP recommendations for initial medical evaluation in atypical presentations [^1179XJYW].

> Wait, let me verify infection-related testing in acute or severe exacerbations. If there is a sudden overnight onset or marked worsening, especially with sore throat or recent febrile illness, checking for acute illness with throat culture or rapid viral testing is sensible. However, I should double-check the status of anti-streptococcal serology because routine ASO or anti-DNase B is not indicated for tic workup unless PANDAS/PANS is specifically suspected, and even then, evidence for a causal link remains mixed and debated in the literature, so these tests should be reserved for carefully selected cases rather than used broadly [^1179XJYW] [^117BTviJ] [^116SBX1m].

> Next, I should review when additional secondary testing is justified. If the phenotype is atypical or the course suggests a secondary process, targeted workup may include a comprehensive metabolic panel, a ceruloplasmin with or without 24-hour urinary copper if Wilson disease is suspected, a heavy metal screen if exposure is plausible, or vitamin B12 and methylmalonic acid if there are neurologic signs raising concern for deficiency. In children with complex movement disorders or syndromic features, next-generation sequencing may be considered within a pediatric movement disorder framework, but I need to ensure this is not overused in classic primary tics [^1179XJYW] [^114dG2sQ].

> Hmm, wait a minute — about ferritin and iron status, I initially thought to check iron studies broadly in all patients, but let me reconsider. Ferritin is included in the baseline panel primarily to screen for iron deficiency, which can impact neurodevelopment and potentially exacerbate tics, and I should confirm that routine transferrin saturation or iron indices are reserved for those with low ferritin or clinical suspicion of iron deficiency, rather than ordered indiscriminately for everyone with tics [^1179XJYW].

> I should confirm medication-driven lab monitoring needs. When using pimozide or ziprasidone, baseline and follow-up ECG with QTc measurement is mandatory, with heightened vigilance for drug–drug interactions that prolong QT. When using pimozide at higher doses, CYP2D6 genotyping is required to adjust dose and mitigate arrhythmia risk, and for agents like aripiprazole, monitoring for metabolic effects with periodic weight, BMI, fasting glucose or HbA1c, and lipids is prudent, even if not uniformly mandated by labels, given guideline emphasis on monitoring and patient safety [^1139iCVV] [^117U8RiL] [^114cYfxG].

> But wait, what if someone requests routine EEG or brain imaging for tics — should I order them reflexively? I need to ensure I do not overuse neurophysiologic or neuroimaging tests; EEG and brain MRI/CT are not routinely recommended in tic evaluation and should be reserved for cases with other neurologic findings, atypical or complex presentations, or diagnostic uncertainty where epilepsy or structural lesions are in the differential, given documented overuse and low diagnostic yield in uncomplicated tics [^1179XJYW] [^111VognA].

> Next, I should review how comorbidities shape testing. High rates of ADHD, OCD, anxiety, mood disorders, and autism spectrum features accompany tic disorders, so screening for these conditions and their functional impact is essential; however, these are clinical assessments and do not require specific laboratory tests, though they may influence the choice of medications that, in turn, necessitate lab monitoring for safety [^114VDoF4] [^111CwQFv] [^113FRFrK] [^115No6Kb].

> Let me synthesize the key principles to guide lab ordering. Routine labs are not indicated for classic primary tics. Obtain a targeted baseline panel when the presentation is new, atypical, severe, or accompanied by systemic or neurologic red flags. Reserve infection testing for acute exacerbations with compatible illness. Avoid routine EEG and neuroimaging unless the clinical picture warrants it. And tailor additional tests to suspected secondary etiologies while avoiding low-yield or investigational biomarkers that lack clinical validation for tic diagnosis or severity prediction [^1179XJYW] [^115jX4kQ].

> Finally, I should double-check that my approach aligns with guideline strength and clinical consensus. AACAP frames many of these recommendations as Clinical Standards or Clinical Guidelines, reflecting strong consensus and empirical support for a conservative, clinically driven lab strategy, while AAN emphasizes functional assessment, comorbidity screening, and judicious use of ancillary tests, reinforcing that labs in tic disorders are tools for specific questions rather than routine screening [^114ephg3] [^114cYfxG].

Routine labs are not required for tic disorders [^1179XJYW], but **basic labs** (CBC, CMP, TSH, ferritin, urinalysis) are reasonable in new-onset, severe, or atypical cases to exclude medical causes [^1179XJYW]. A **urine drug screen** is appropriate when substance use is suspected [^1179XJYW]. Streptococcal testing (ASO/anti-DNase B, throat culture) is only for sudden-onset tics with OCD or choreiform movements, not routine [^1179XJYW] [^116SBX1m]. EEG, MRI, and genetic testing are reserved for atypical features or neurological signs [^1179XJYW] [^114dG2sQ]. No biomarkers diagnose tics; labs are used to exclude other causes or guide treatment [^115jX4kQ].

---

## Routine laboratory tests

Routine laboratory testing is **not universally required** for tic disorders; however, certain basic tests may be considered in specific clinical scenarios to exclude medical conditions that could mimic or exacerbate tics [^1179XJYW]:

- **Complete blood count (CBC)**: To exclude anemia or infection.
- **Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)**: To assess renal, hepatic, and electrolyte status.
- **Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)**: To exclude thyroid dysfunction.
- **Ferritin**: To screen for iron deficiency, which has been associated with tic severity [^notfound].
- **Urinalysis**: To exclude renal or metabolic abnormalities.

These tests are **particularly relevant** in new-onset tics, severe or atypical presentations, or when comorbid medical conditions are suspected [^1179XJYW].

---

## Specialized laboratory tests

Specialized laboratory tests are **not routinely indicated** but may be considered in specific clinical scenarios:

- **Urine drug screen**: Recommended for adolescents or when substance use is suspected [^1179XJYW].
- **Streptococcal testing**: Antistreptolysin O (ASO) and anti-DNase B antibodies, along with throat culture, are considered only in cases of sudden-onset tics accompanied by obsessive-compulsive symptoms or choreiform movements, suggestive of Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections (PANDAS) [^notfound].
- **Copper studies**: Serum ceruloplasmin and 24-hour urinary copper to exclude Wilson's disease in cases of atypical or severe tics [^notfound].
- **Genetic testing**: Next-generation sequencing (NGS) may be considered in cases of suspected genetic syndromes or familial tic disorders [^114dG2sQ].

---

## Imaging and neurophysiological studies

Imaging and neurophysiological studies are **not routinely recommended** for tic disorders but may be indicated in specific clinical scenarios:

- **Electroencephalography (EEG)**: Reserved for cases with atypical features, seizures, or neurological abnormalities [^1179XJYW] [^111VognA].
- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: Considered in cases of atypical tics, neurological abnormalities, or suspected structural brain lesions [^1179XJYW].
- **Computed tomography (CT)**: Generally not recommended due to radiation exposure, but may be considered in acute settings when MRI is unavailable [^notfound].

---

## Biomarkers and genetic testing

Currently, there are **no validated biomarkers** for diagnosing tic disorders [^115jX4kQ]. Genetic testing is not routinely recommended but may be considered in cases of suspected genetic syndromes or familial tic disorders [^116SBX1m].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize that laboratory testing should be **individualized** based on clinical presentation, severity, and comorbidities [^1179XJYW]. Routine laboratory testing is not required for all patients with tic disorders but may be considered in specific clinical scenarios to exclude medical conditions that could mimic or exacerbate tics [^1179XJYW].

CTD treatment prioritization — Treatment for CTD should address the levels of impairment and distress caused by the tics as well as any comorbid conditions, and if tics are mild in severity there may be no need for intervention after psychoeducation, while potential adverse events associated with treatment interventions should be carefully weighed. When establishing the treatment hierarchy, begin with the most impairing condition; in many circumstances the comorbid condition causes the most impairment and is the best target to improve functional outcomes, with evidence that OCD and ADHD have a stronger impact on quality of life and that initial treatment frequently addresses target symptoms from comorbid condition with ongoing monitoring of tics.

### Tic disorder in allergic rhinitis children and adolescents: a case-control study [^116nTVk5]. BMC Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Data gathering

A specialized pediatrician in allergy and clinical immunology evaluated all the cases in this study. The diagnosis of allergic rhinitis was based on ARIA guidelines and a comprehensive examination of the patient's medical history and physical symptoms, as well as skin testing (wheal more than 3 mm or flare more than 10 mm in comparison to negative control is considered as a positive result). Patients diagnosed with allergic rhinitis who exhibited signs or symptoms of tic disorders (motor tics such as blinking or shoulder shrugging or vocal tics such as humming, sniffing, clearing the throat, or yelling out a word or phrase) were referred to a psychiatrist for further evaluation and diagnosis. The diagnosis and classification of tic disorders were based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5). Additionally, patients diagnosed with allergic rhinitis but did not exhibit any symptoms of tic disorders were included in the study as a control group, with age and sex frequency matching. The collected data include demographic characteristics such as age, sex, date of birth, place of residence, and place of birth, as well as family history of other diseases, whether the patient is a first-born, age of onset and duration of AR and tic disorders, smoking habits of the mother during and after pregnancy, frequency of AR and tic disorder symptoms, detailed history of other diseases (e.g. migraine, cold, etc.), detailed history of other allergic conditions (e.g. food allergy, eczema, etc.), detailed history of neurological, psychological, or behavioral disorders, and detailed drug history. The classification of tic disorders was based on the DSM-5 criteria, and the patient's laboratory workup, including skin prick testing, was collected and evaluated. After considering our assumption and previous studies, we have identified the following variables as predictors:

Age of onset and duration of AR and tic disorders.
Smoking habits of mother during and after pregnancy.
Family history of other diseases.
Detailed history of other allergic conditions.
Detailed history of neurological, psychological, or behavioral disorders.
Detailed drug history.

Also, the variables Age, Sex, living place, Birthplace, Family history of other diseases, Detailed history of other diseases, Detailed history of other allergic conditions, Detailed history of neurological, psychological, or behavioral disorders, and Detailed drug history were considered as potential confounders. The frequency of AR and tic disorder symptoms and Skin prick testing variables were considered effect modifiers.

### Diagnostic approach to paediatric movement disorders: a clinical practice guide [^116SBX1m]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Tics

Tics are divided into either primary or secondary tic disorders. Primary tic disorders are the most common. Transient tic disorder is the most frequent primary tic disorder in children followed by Tourette syndrome. Secondary tic disorders are rare and can be caused by acquired or genetic disorders (chromosomal or heredo‐degenerative). It has been hypothesized that an acute onset of tics with neuropsychiatric symptoms (such as obsessive–compulsive disorder) might be associated with an aberrant immune response to an infectious episode, described as paediatric auto‐immune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infection; however, the true relation with streptococcal infection is still debated. 5 If the patient has an isolated tic disorder, further diagnostic testing is not necessary.

Dystonia

The aetiology of dystonia can be divided into acquired or genetic. Acquired causes can be divided in structural lesions, vascular insults, and infectious or auto‐immune disorders. For genetic dystonia the list of causes is extensive. 8 Classification of the clinical characteristics of dystonia is important, because of the implications for diagnostic testing and treatment. 8, 20 van Egmond et al. described a diagnostic algorithm to help clinicians decide which patients would benefit from NGS technologies or whether they would require other initial investigations. 8

Chorea

To facilitate diagnosis, a (sub‐)acute onset should be distinguished from chronic chorea. (Sub‐)acute chorea is the most common form in children; the aetiology is frequently acquired and can be subdivided into auto‐immune (Sydenham chorea), infectious/inflammatory, vascular, hypoxic, and drug‐ or toxin‐induced. Chronic chorea is categorized as primary (isolated genetic chorea) or secondary (perinatal hypoxic ischemic injuries, neurodegenerative, and metabolic or auto‐immune disorders). The secondary aetiologies are mainly multisystem diseases in which chorea can be the main symptom, but it is often accompanied by other (non‐)neurological symptoms. 1, 21 In particular in the latter case, further genetic diagnostic work‐up with NGS is warranted (see Step 6).

### Healthcare utilisation and costs associated with poor access to diagnosis and treatment for children and young people with tic disorders [^117C5Tef]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

Clinical implications

A solution to this problem would be to publish NICE guidelines to facilitate a clear assessment and treatment pathway for patients with tic disorders. Providing these guidelines would ensure transparency and equitability in care provision among healthcare professionals and facilitate a standard approach to care. It would also support adequate funding, resources and quality standards being allocated to tic disorders. However, it would be equally important that appropriate evidence-based treatment was available. One solution to this may be found in providing low-intensity, online, remotely delivered therapy, such as that offered in ORBIT. The findings demonstrate here that offering an intervention such as ORBIT has the potential to save a conservative £1 million for every 127 000 young people with tics by reducing burden/use of healthcare services in addition to the clinical benefits to the individual. It is important to note that this possible cost saving is still made even though offering a service such as ORBIT would be adding a new service and offering treatment to children and young people who currently are unlikely to receive any evidence-based therapy for their tics.

### Candidate diagnostic biomarkers for neurodevelopmental disorders in children and adolescents: a systematic review [^115jX4kQ]. World Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Neurodevelopmental disorders - including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder, communication disorders, intellectual disability, motor disorders, specific learning disorders, and tic disorders - manifest themselves early in development. Valid, reliable and broadly usable biomarkers supporting a timely diagnosis of these disorders would be highly relevant from a clinical and public health standpoint. We conducted the first systematic review of studies on candidate diagnostic biomarkers for these disorders in children and adolescents. We searched Medline and Embase + Embase Classic with terms relating to biomarkers until April 6, 2022, and conducted additional targeted searches for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and neuroimaging or neurophysiological studies carried out by international consortia. We considered a candidate biomarker as promising if it was reported in at least two independent studies providing evidence of sensitivity and specificity of at least 80%. After screening 10,625 references, we retained 780 studies (374 biochemical, 203 neuroimaging, 133 neurophysiological and 65 neuropsychological studies, and five GWAS), including a total of approximately 120,000 cases and 176,000 controls. While the majority of the studies focused simply on associations, we could not find any biomarker for which there was evidence - from two or more studies from independent research groups, with results going into the same direction - of specificity and sensitivity of at least 80%. Other important metrics to assess the validity of a candidate biomarker, such as positive predictive value and negative predictive value, were infrequently reported. Limitations of the currently available studies include mostly small sample size, heterogeneous approaches and candidate biomarker targets, undue focus on single instead of joint biomarker signatures, and incomplete accounting for potential confounding factors. Future multivariable and multi-level approaches may be best suited to find valid candidate biomarkers, which will then need to be validated in external, independent samples and then, importantly, tested in terms of feasibility and cost-effectiveness, before they can be implemented in daily clinical practice.

### An occurrence of mass psychogenic illness: leRoy, New York [^117Y3N88]. Journal of Child Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Mass psychogenic illness (MPI), also known as mass sociogenic illness, is a functional neurologic symptom disorder affecting multiple people simultaneously. This study presents a pediatric MPI outbreak involving abrupt-onset tics in LeRoy, NY, during 2011–2012. The analysis provides diagnostic evidence and highlights challenges with diagnosing MPI. Patients presented with tics evolving into syncope, psychogenic nonepileptic seizure, and migraine. Laboratory test types (n = 64) were evaluated, with n = 32 of 64 yielding abnormal results. Deviations were reported in 5% intervals for quantitative tests, with n = 13 of 32 test types < 10% and n = 14 of 32 test types > 10% from normal. The remaining n = 5 of 32 test types were qualitative. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results found n = 7 of 13 normal, n = 4 of 13 normal variants, and n = 2 of 13 abnormal. Electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography, head computed tomography (CT), and echocardiogram results were normal. All patients recovered from MPI. Clinical presentation supported the MPI diagnosis; laboratory/ancillary testing did not support an alternative. Abnormal results were either consistent with patient history, incidental, or treated without symptom resolution. Outside environmental testing did not yield an alternative.

### Patient selection and assessment recommendations for deep brain stimulation in tourette syndrome [^116rXdQd]. Movement Disorders (2006). Low credibility.

In response to recent publicity regarding the potential use of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for reducing tic severity in Tourette's syndrome (TS), the Tourette Syndrome Association convened a group of TS and DBS experts to develop recommendations to guide the early use and potential clinical trials of DBS for TS and other tic disorders. The goals of these recommendations are to ensure that all surgical candidates are (1) fully informed about the risks, benefits, and alternative treatments available; (2) receive a comprehensive evaluation before surgery to ensure that DBS is clearly the appropriate clinical treatment choice; and (3) that early clinical experience will be documented publicly to facilitate rational decision-making for both clinical care and future clinical trials.

### Trauma-induced coagulopathy in severely injured patients: knowledge lost in translation? [^1166LiVE]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Many guidelines exist on how to treat patients with multiple injuries correctly in an accident and emergency setting. The aim of the present work was to find out how well patients are treated focusing on trauma induced coagulopathy (TIC), and what anaesthetists involved in trauma care think about their own experiences with TIC.

Methods

In a retrospective chart review of patients with an Injury Severity Score (ISS) ≥ 16 between October 2007 and October 2008. A total of 172 patients with multiple injuries (134 men, 38 women) were treated in the resuscitation room and underwent complete coagulation screening (international normalised ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), thrombin time (TT)). The presence of TIC was defined as INR > 1.5 and aPTT > 60 s or TT > 15 s. Additionally, during the weekly anaesthesia and critical care grand round, a short questionnaire about TIC management was distributed to all anaesthetists involved in trauma care.

Results

Of the 172 patients with multiple injuries, 56 (32.6%) had TIC at admission to the resuscitation bay and 7 of these 56 (12.5%) received fresh-frozen plasma in the first hour of treatment. The mean of 55 anaesthetists thought that TIC could be corrected within about 30 min, although a chart review shows that it takes about 60 min to get complete laboratory based coagulation screening results. However, 70% of the doctors are not satisfied with the laboratory results they receive concerning TIC.

Conclusions

There is an obvious discrepancy between the content of guidelines and the everyday practice. Future academic efforts in the area of trauma care should therefore focus more on the translational approach and the implementation of existing knowledge rather than on simply formulating guidelines.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with tic disorders [^117MyeUZ]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Medium credibility.

Tic disorders in children and adolescents — genetic and environmental factors with PANDAS/PANS are described as follows: Chronic tic disorder (CTD) shows a genetic link, but candidate-gene association and nonparametric linkage studies have not yielded definitive susceptibility genes for tic disorders, and a recent genome-wide association study revealed that no markers reached a genome wide threshold of significance. Identified rare variants via cytogenetic assays and analysis of copy number variations have shown overlap with other neuropsychiatric disorders and affect a small percentage of those with tic disorders, and a parametric linkage study has ignited interest in histidine decarboxylase with implications for histaminergic and dopaminergic signaling in the striatum. Tics appear to be sensitive to environmental stimuli such as temperature changes, stress, illness, and fatigue that can exacerbate tics. PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric syndrome associated with streptococcus) describes childhood-onset obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and/or tics with acute onset following a streptococcal infection, neurological signs, and an episodic course, whereas PANS (pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome) describes sudden-onset OCD in which tics are not a required feature and a link to prior streptococcal infections is not always evident. In children with PANS/PANDAS, reported associated symptoms include separation anxiety, nightmares, personality change, oppositional behaviors, and deterioration in mathematics skills and handwriting, and studies suggest that in some cases a prior history of infections may increase risk for developing tic disorder, although this remains controversial.

### Efficacy and safety of fixed-dose deutetrabenazine in children and adolescents for tics associated with tourette syndrome: a randomized clinical trial [^112Zxz1e]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Tourette syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by childhood onset of motor and phonic tics, often accompanied by behavioral and psychiatric comorbidities. Deutetrabenazine is a vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitor approved in the US for the treatment of chorea associated with Huntington disease and tardive dyskinesia.

Objective

To report results of the ARTISTS 2 (Alternatives for Reducing Tics in Tourette Syndrome 2) study examining deutetrabenazine for treatment of Tourette syndrome.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, fixed-dose study was conducted over 8 weeks with a 1-week follow-up (June 21, 2018, to December 9, 2019). Children and adolescents aged 6 to 16 years with a diagnosis of Tourette syndrome and active tics causing distress or impairment were enrolled in the study. Children were recruited from 52 sites in 10 countries. Data were analyzed from February 4 to April 22, 2020.

Interventions

Participants were randomized (1:1:1) to low-dose deutetrabenazine (up to 36 mg/d), high-dose deutetrabenazine (up to 48 mg/d), or a matching placebo, which were titrated over 4 weeks to the target dose followed by a 4-week maintenance period.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary efficacy end point was change from baseline to week 8 in the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale-Total Tic Score (YGTSS-TTS) for high-dose deutetrabenazine. Key secondary end points included changes in YGTSS-TTS for low-dose deutetrabenazine, Tourette Syndrome Clinical Global Impression score, Tourette Syndrome Patient Global Impression of Impact score, and Child and Adolescent Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome-Quality of Life Activities of Daily Living subscale score. Safety assessments included incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events, laboratory parameters, vital signs, and questionnaires.

Results

The study included 158 children and adolescents (mean [SD] age, 11.7 [2.6] years). A total of 119 participants (75%) were boys; 7 (4%), Asian; 1 (1%), Black; 32 (20%), Hispanic; 4 (3%), Native American; 135 (85%), White; 2 (1%), multiracial; 9 (6%), other race; and 1 (0.6%), of unknown ethnic origin. Fifty-two participants were randomized to the high-dose deutetrabenazine group, 54 to the low-dose deutetrabenazine group, and 52 to the placebo group. Baseline characteristics for participants were similar between groups. Of the total 158 participants, 64 (41%) were aged 6 to 11 years, and 94 (59%) were aged 12 to 16 years at baseline. Mean time since Tourette syndrome diagnosis was 3.3 (2.8) years, and mean baseline YGTSS-TTS was 33.8 (6.6) points. At week 8, the difference in YGTSS-TTS was not significant between the high-dose deutetrabenazine and placebo groups (least-squares mean difference, -0.8 points; 95% CI, -3.9 to 2.3 points; p = 0.60; Cohen d, -0.11). There were no nominally significant differences between groups for key secondary end points. Treatment-emergent adverse events were reported for 34 participants (65%) treated with high-dose deutetrabenazine, 24 (44%) treated with low-dose deutetrabenazine, and 25 (49%) treated with placebo and were generally mild or moderate.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this fixed-dose randomized clinical trial of deutetrabenazine in children and adolescents with Tourette syndrome, the primary efficacy end point was not met. No new safety signals were identified.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with tic disorders [^113UpQcj]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Medium credibility.

AACAP practice parameter — Recommendation 8 (medications for CTD): Medications for chronic tic disorder should be considered for moderate to severe tics causing severe impairment in quality of life or when medication responsive psychiatric comorbidities are present that target both tic symptoms and comorbid conditions. Trials are limited, with most studies focusing on moderate to severe severity and yielding symptom reduction rather than remission; medical treatments for tics should have evidence-based support whenever feasible. Only 2 Food and Drug Administration–approved medications to treat TD are listed (haloperidol and pimozide), although most clinicians use atypical antipsychotics before these agents.

Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in children with tics — assessment and treatment: Obsessive-compulsive behaviors are common in people with Tourette syndrome (TS), with a comorbid diagnosis of OCD made in 10%–50%, and individuals with tics may not respond as well to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors but respond equally well to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT); CBT is considered first-line treatment of OCD in individuals with tic disorders. Clinicians should ensure an assessment for comorbid OCD is performed in people with tics (Level B), and in people with tics and OCD, clinicians should ensure appropriate OCD treatment is provided (Level B).

### Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus: comparison of diagnosis and treatment in the community and at a specialty clinic [^116L9vWQ]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study aimed to examine whether pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus were appropriately diagnosed in the community and to determine subsequent rates of unwarranted use of antibiotic treatment for tics and obsessive-compulsive symptoms without the identification of an infection.

Methods

The design was a retrospective, cross-sectional, observational study of 176 children and adolescents who were evaluated in a specialty program for tics, Tourette's disorder, and related problems. Previously published diagnostic criteria were used to establish the diagnosis of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus in our clinic.

Results

Subjects were significantly less likely to receive a diagnosis of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus at the specialty clinic than in the community. In the community, subjects were significantly more likely to be treated with antibiotics or immunosuppressant medication if they received a diagnosis of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus. Of the 27 subjects with a community diagnosis of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus who were treated with antibiotics, 22 (82%) were treated without laboratory evidence of an infection; 2 were treated with immunomodulatory medications.

Conclusions

Our results support our hypothesis that pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcus are frequently diagnosed in the community without the application of all working diagnostic criteria. This phenomenon has resulted in unwarranted use of antibiotic treatment for tics/obsessive-compulsive disorder without evidence of laboratory infection.

Psychiatric comorbidities and suicide risk in Tourette syndrome: Population-based and clinic-based studies have shown that people with TS are at high risk of other psychiatric comorbidities, including anxiety disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, and mood disorders. A matched case–control study using a national registry found an increased risk of dying by suicide and attempting suicide in people with TS compared with controls, which persisted after adjusting for psychiatric comorbidity. Clinicians must ensure appropriate screening for anxiety, mood, and disruptive behavior disorders is performed in people with tics (Level A), and clinicians must inquire about suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts in people with TS and refer to appropriate resources if present (Level A).

### A trans-diagnostic perspective on obsessive-compulsive disorder [^111yrb29]. Psychological Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Combining trans-diagnostic with existing approaches

We have argued strongly in favour of the trans-diagnostic model as a rational approach to advance basic science research in psychiatry, but must make clear that to date this approach has yet to facilitate gene discovery or the development of new, better treatments. It will take time for sufficient data to accrue and as such, dismissing symptom-based approaches entirely is premature. Existing clinical trial datasets, based on patients grouped according to conventional diagnostic criteria such as DSM, have demonstrated a clear specificity of effect for certain psychiatric treatments [e.g. serotonin v. noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors in OCD (Fineberg et al.)], and a magnitude of efficacy for some of our treatments commensurate with the effect sizes seen in other branches of medicine (Davis et al; Leucht et al.). We have also seen that specific drug response can be linked to easily observable symptoms, such as the presence of tics (Bloch et al.). The hope is that by revisiting how we define disorder and/or dimensions using biological and cognitive data will further enhance the precision with which treatments can be delivered to individuals. In addition, new ways of assessing the outcomes of treatment trials, e.g. using statistical techniques such as group-based mixture models, that divide 'diagnostic' patient samples into clinically meaningful subgroups with greater predictive value, hold promise for the advancement of personalized psychiatric treatment (Thase et al.). Thus, most progress is likely to be made with a balanced approach, taking into account and if possible combining the most valid and reliable diagnostic and trans-diagnostic methodologies.

- CDC conducts research on tools to help improve screening and identification of tic disorders. Background Around 1 million people in the United States have Tourette syndrome or another tic disorder. More than half of children with TS do not get diagnosed. Identification of tic disorders helps people get the treatment and help they need. CDC and partner resources help improve the identification of tic disorders. More information about TS nervous system. TS causes people to have "tics". Education and support CDC's National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities has partnered with the Tourette Association of America to provide educational programs to improve awareness of tic disorders and TS so that more people with tic disorders get the right diagnosis, care, and support.

The programs use up-to-date, science-based information to educate physicians and allied professionals and school personnel, as well as those who have TS, their families, and the general public, about TS. In addition to education, the CDC's partnership with TAA helps people with a tic disorder and their families make meaningful connections: Screening and diagnostic tools In addition to education about tics and tic disorders, healthcare professionals need tools to screen and identify tic disorders, and such tools are currently limited.

### Distinguishing functional from primary tics: a study of expert video assessments [^115vEadP]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic disagreement between expert clinicians may have been the result of differing criteria used to establish a functional tic diagnosis, and differences in practical experience with functional tic patients based on referral biases and practice volumes. At the time of performing this analysis, diagnostic clues for the diagnosis of functional tic disorder had been discussed in several publicationsbut specific criteria were not formally established, leaving the clinicians involved in this project to mainly rely on their own clinical intuition to make this diagnosis. Furthermore, clinical volumes with patients with functional tics varied between expert clinicians, which likely influenced individual expertise and confidence in making a functional tic diagnosis.

Our study could not assess the accuracy of our experts' final diagnostic judgement, due to the lack of diagnostic standards or biomarkers. Very recently, after our data collection was complete, a single-centre study developed a set of diagnostic criteria that yielded encouraging discriminatory capacity to differentiate between the diagnoses of 'functional tic disorder' and 'primary tic disorder'. Although differentiation by these criteria required the presence of at least 2 of 7 different phenomenological characteristics potentially detectable through direct observation alone, it also required additional clinical information that included type of onset, comorbidity, and even sex at birth and family history. Even more recently, consensus-based diagnostic criteria for the clinical diagnosis of functional tic like behaviours have been published by an international group with expertise in tic disorders. A 'clinically definite' diagnosis requires the presence of three major criterion which allow clinicians to differentiate functional tic like behaviours from tics — age of symptom onset (age 12 and older), rapid onset and evolution of symptoms (over hours to days) and the presence of four of nine phenomenological features. While broad clinical applicability and usefulness of these criteria will need to be verified by other authors, their formulation aligns with our findings that phenomenology alone is insufficient to differentiate between functional and primary tic disorders.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with tic disorders [^11193mTy]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Medium credibility.

Table 1 — repetitive movements of childhood — outlines key distinctions useful for differential diagnosis. Tics are described as sudden rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic vocalization or motor movement, with typical disorders where present including transient tics, Tourette's disorder (TD), and chronic tic disorders (CTD). Dystonia is defined as involuntary, sustained, or intermittent muscle contractions that cause twisting and repetitive movements, abnormal postures, or both, and is associated with DYT1 gene, Wilson's, myoclonic dystonia, and extrapyramidal symptoms due to dopamine blocking agents. Stereotypies are stereotyped, rhythmic, repetitive movements or patterns of speech with lack of variation over time, associated with autism, stereotypic movement disorder, and intellectual disability. Compulsions are a repetitive, excessive, meaningless activity or mental exercise that a person performs in an attempt to avoid distress or worry, associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anorexia, body dysmorphic disorder, hoarding disorder, trichotillomania, and excoriation disorder.

### Recent advances in tourette syndrome [^111f2QW8]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review considers the recent literature pertaining to the neurobiology, genetics and treatment of Tourette syndrome.

Recent Findings

Over the last several years, both neuropathological and genetic findings have further focused attention on long-standing hypotheses regarding the role of the basal ganglia in causing tics and Tourette syndrome. Moreover, although the field awaits the results the first large-scale genetic studies, recent findings have already mirrored developments in the neuropsychiatric genetics literature more broadly, highlighting the value of the study of rare variation and the overlap of risks among seemingly disparate diagnostic categories. Finally, treatment studies have underscored the importance of cognitive-behavioral as well as pharmacological interventions for the treatment of tic disorders.

Summary

Recent findings have led to novel, testable hypotheses regarding the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying Tourette syndrome. These, in turn, have begun to provide new avenues to conceptualizing treatment strategies. Although the development of additional medication options is a pressing need, recent data has demonstrated both the safety and efficacy of nonpharmacological approaches.

Tic disorders in children and adolescents — atypical antipsychotic efficacy and safety: Risperidone is described as an effective treatment with effective doses ranging from 1.0 to 3.5 mg per day, and pediatric patients had no clinically significant extrapyramidal symptoms. In an RCT, ziprasidone produced a 39% decrease on the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale compared to 16% for placebo, and a prospective study reported a mean QTc increase of 28 ± 28 milliseconds, leading to a recommendation of obtaining screening EKGs when considering ziprasidone. Olanzapine decreased tics but was associated with a mean weight gain of 9 to 12 pounds, and olanzapine should not be the first line medication for CTD. Open-label aripiprazole data found a 52% reduction in YGTSS with 79% of patients "much improved" or "very much improved", with a mean dose of 9.8 mg per day; common adverse effects were hypersomnia (37.5%), nausea (20.8%), and headache (16.6%), and open trials noted mean weight gain of 2 to 5 pounds.

### Tic disorders: from pathophysiology to treatment [^1121hA21]. Journal of Neurology (2006). Low credibility.

Tic disorders are stereotypic behaviours, more frequent than once believed, and therefore likely to be encountered by primary care physicians. Tics usually begin in childhood and are the clinical hallmark of Tourette Syndrome (TS), the most common cause of tics. TS is a relatively common neurobehavioural disorder with a spectrum of manifestations that wax and wane during its natural course. The pathophysiology of tics, at molecular and cellular level, is still unknown, whereas structural and functional neuroimaging studies have shown the involvement of the basal ganglia and related cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits, and the dopaminergic neuronal system. Moreover, TS has a strong genetic background. The management of TS is often complicated by the presence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and other behaviour disorders. The correct diagnosis is a fundamental step for a proper management of these disorders, and a multimodal treatment is usually indicated. This approach includes educational and supportive interventions, as well as pharmacological treatments when tics are at their worst.

### Streptococcal upper respiratory tract infections and exacerbations of tic and obsessive-compulsive symptoms: a prospective longitudinal study [^117BTviJ]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this blinded, prospective, longitudinal study was to determine whether new group A β hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infections are temporally associated with exacerbations of tic or obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms in children who met published criteria for pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS). A group of children with Tourette syndrome and/or OC disorder without a PANDAS history served as the comparison (non-PANDAS) group.

Method

Consecutive clinical ratings of tic and OC symptom severity were obtained for 31 PANDAS subjects and 53 non-PANDAS subjects. Clinical symptoms and laboratory values (throat cultures and streptococcal antibody titers) were evaluated at regular intervals during a 25-month period. Additional testing occurred at the time of any tic or OC symptom exacerbation. New GABHS infections were established by throat swab cultures and/or recent significant rise in streptococcal antibodies. Laboratory personnel were blinded to case or control status, clinical (exacerbation or not) condition, and clinical evaluators were blinded to the laboratory results.

Results

No group differences were observed in the number of clinical exacerbations or the number of newly diagnosed GABHS infections. On only six occasions of a total of 51 (12%), a newly diagnosed GABHS infection was followed, within 2 months, by an exacerbation of tic and/or OC symptoms. In every instance, this association occurred in the non-PANDAS group.

Conclusions

This study provides no evidence for a temporal association between GABHS infections and tic/OC symptom exacerbations in children who meet the published PANDAS diagnostic criteria.

### Group A streptococcal infections and tic disorders in an Italian pediatric population [^112JZjgY]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The relationship between childhood tic disorders and group A streptococcal (GAS) infections has been recently investigated by several research groups, but no systematic evaluation of laboratory indicators of GAS infections has been provided.

Objective

The aim of our study was to seek clinical and laboratory evidence of GAS infections in a large population of children affected with tic disorders.

Study Design

This investigation was a case-control study: 150 consecutive children presenting with tics were investigated for clinical and laboratory signs of streptococcal infections on the occasion of their first neuropsychiatric consultation. To compare the rate of exposition to GAS in a similar population, a control group of 150 children without tic disorders was examined during the same period.

Results

In children with tics, mean antistreptolysin O (ASO) titer (434 ± 338 IU) was significantly higher compared with that of control subjects (155 ± 126 IU); 38% of the children with tics compared with 2% of the control subjects (P < .001) had ASO titers ≥ 500 IU. Twenty-six children with tics (17%) had throat cultures positive for GAS, but in all cases, only few colonies per plate were isolated. Among the strains isolated, no prevalent T pattern or M type was observed. In children with tics a positive correlation between ASO titers and severity of tic disorder (measured by the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale) was found.

Conclusion

Our results suggest that children with tic disorder could be a unique population in which GAS infection, or at least the exposure to streptococcal antigens, is correlated to the neurobehavioral disorder. Moreover, our data indicate a relationship between the severity of tic disorder and the magnitude of the serologic response to GAS antigens.

### Anti-basal ganglia antibodies: a possible diagnostic utility in idiopathic movement disorders? [^116uVufz]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2004). Low credibility.

Background

The spectrum of post-streptococcal brain disorders includes chorea, tics, and dystonia. The proposed mediators of disease are anti-basal ganglia (neuronal) antibodies (ABGA).

Aim

To evaluate ABGA as a potential diagnostic marker in a cohort of UK post-streptococcal movement disorders.

Methods

Forty UK children presenting with movement disorders associated with streptococcal infection were recruited. ABGA was measured using ELISA and Western immunoblotting. To determine ABGA specificity and sensitivity, children with neurological diseases (n = 100), children with uncomplicated streptococcal infection (n = 40), and children with autoimmune disease (n = 50) were enrolled as controls.

Results

The mean ELISA result was increased in the post-streptococcal movement disorder group compared to all controls and derived a sensitivity of 82.4% and specificity of 79%. The Western immunoblotting method to detect ABGA derived a sensitivity and specificity of 92.5% and 94.7% respectively. There was common binding to basal ganglia antigens of 40, 45, and 60 kDa. Immunofluorescence localised the antibody binding to basal ganglia neurones.

Conclusion

ABGA appears to be a potentially useful diagnostic marker in post-streptococcal neurological disorders. Western immunoblotting appears to be the preferred method due to good sensitivity and specificity and the ability to test several samples at once.

### Healthcare utilisation and costs associated with poor access to diagnosis and treatment for children and young people with tic disorders [^111PXTYE]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

Conclusions

Overall, our findings show that young people with tic disorders are likely to engage in substantial use of healthcare resources as a result of inadequate pathways and treatment options. Most young people are unable to access a specialist tic service and case study data indicate that other healthcare services (such as CAMHS or paediatric services) are currently unlikely to have the expertise to support tics. Young people with tics are also likely to miss vital parts of their education. There is a clear need to provide guidelines and services to support people with tics. Our findings indicate that adding a tic treatment service is likely to result in overall cost savings to the NHS as well as providing access to evidence-based treatment, which is currently of limited availability.

### Diagnostic approach to paediatric movement disorders: a clinical practice guide [^114dG2sQ]. Developmental Medicine and Child Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Paediatric movement disorders (PMDs) comprise a large group of disorders (tics, myoclonus, tremor, dystonia, chorea, Parkinsonism, ataxia), often with mixed phenotypes. Determination of the underlying aetiology can be difficult given the broad differential diagnosis and the complexity of the genotype-phenotype relationships. This can make the diagnostic process time-consuming and difficult. In this overview, we present a diagnostic approach for PMDs, with emphasis on genetic causes. This approach can serve as a framework to lead the clinician through the diagnostic process in eight consecutive steps, including recognition of the different movement disorders, identification of a clinical syndrome, consideration of acquired causes, genetic testing including next-generation sequencing, post-sequencing phenotyping, and interpretation of test results. The aim of this approach is to increase the recognition and diagnostic yield in PMDs. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: An up-to-date description and diagnostic framework for testing of paediatric movement disorders is presented. The framework helps to determine which patients will benefit from next-generation sequencing.

### Developing a phenotype risk score for tic disorders in a large, clinical biobank [^1118ZTQV]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tic disorders (TD) are the most common movement disorder in children and are characterized by sudden and recurrent movements and/or vocalizations. While many tic symptoms resolve within a year, persistent TD can cause disruptions to daily life and may have long-term effects on an individual's social, physical, and mental health. TD is highly comorbid with several other psychiatric and neurodevelopmental conditions, including obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), among others. One study found that 86% of individuals diagnosed with the most common tic disorder, Tourette syndrome, are diagnosed with at least one additional psychiatric disorder during their lifetime, and up to 58% of Tourette syndrome patients are diagnosed with two or more additional psychiatric disorders during their lifetime. This phenotypic heterogeneity complicates the diagnosis and treatment of patients with Tourette syndrome and other TDs.

Tic disorders are both phenotypically and genetically complex. Heritability measurements for Tourette syndrome range from 0.58 to 0.77 and suggest a strong underlying genetic component; however, identifying the genetic signatures of TD has been difficult. Familial and patient studies have identified candidate genes, none of which have been confirmed in independent investigations. Genome-wide association studies of TD and Tourette syndrome demonstrate high polygenicity and have identified a few genome-wide significant signals, including Collagen Type XXVII Alpha 1 chain, COL27A1 and Fms Related Receptor Tyrosine Kinase 3, FLT-3, though neither locus has been replicated in an independent study to date. This lack of replicable signals is likely due to the polygenic nature of TD, in addition to the challenge of recruiting large cohorts of TD patients.

Electronic health records (EHRs) are a useful resource for studying disease outcomes and comorbidities. EHR systems often date back decades and document a wide range of phenotype information, including diagnosis and billing codes, clinician notes, medical histories, lab results, medications, and procedural codes. Additionally, EHR systems allow for the investigation of individuals across diverse disease groups without requiring the resources needed to recruit large cohorts of individuals for genomic studies. In the case of phenotypically complex conditions such as TD, EHRs can provide dense phenotype information spanning before and after diagnosis.

### The new "Wholly trinity" in the diagnosis and management of inborn errors of immunity [^113uLZ4N]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). Medium credibility.

The field of immunology has a rich and diverse history, and the study of inborn errors of immunity (IEIs) represents both the "cake" and the "icing on top of the cake", as it has enabled significant advances in our understanding of the human immune system. This explosion of knowledge has been facilitated by a unique partnership, a triumvirate formed by the physician who gathers detailed immunological and clinical phenotypic information from, and shares results with, the patient; the laboratory scientist/immunologist who performs diagnostic testing, as well as advanced functional correlative studies; and the genomics scientist/genetic counselor, who conducts and interprets varied genetic analyses, all of which are essential for dissecting constitutional genetic disorders. Although the basic principles of clinical care have not changed in recent years, the practice of clinical immunology has changed to reflect the prodigious advances in diagnostics, genomics, and therapeutics. An "omic/tics"-centric approach to IEI reflects the tremendous strides made in the field in the new millennium with recognition of new disorders, characterization of the molecular underpinnings, and development and implementation of personalized treatment strategies. This review brings renewed attention to bear on the indispensable "trinity" of phenotypic, genomic, and immunological analyses in the diagnosis, management, and treatment of IEIs.

### Healthcare utilisation and costs associated with poor access to diagnosis and treatment for children and young people with tic disorders [^1142LFFN]. BMJ Mental Health (2024). High credibility.

In the UK, there are no National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for the assessment, diagnosis and treatment of tic disorder. A lack of guidelines may have contributed to the variation in healthcare provision and lack of uncertainty about how best to support the patients. The impact of this was highlighted in a recent survey of patient experience of accessing healthcare for tic disorders. The findings demonstrated that respondents often felt their general practitioner (GP) was not knowledgeable on tic disorders. Respondents reported a struggle to get referred onto a secondary care service, and even when their referral was made it was declined as the service did not provide support for tic disorders, leading to multiple subsequent referrals to different services, some of which required long travel time from their home. Almost one-third of respondents reported access to private healthcare as a result of inadequate National Health Service (NHS) services.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic cough, more specifically with respect to patients with somatic or tic cough (diagnosis), ACCP 2015 guidelines recommend to diagnose tic cough disorder in adult and pediatric patients with chronic cough that has remained medically unexplained after a comprehensive evaluation when the patient manifests the core clinical features of tics (suppressibility, distractibility, suggestibility, variability, and the presence of a premonitory sensation, whether the cough is single or one of many).

### Recognition and management of Tourette's syndrome and tic… [^115w5Vt1]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

An extremely important concept in the evaluation and development of treatment programs for patients with tic disorders is the recognition that multiple undiagnosed comorbid conditions may result in a moderate to severe level of functional impairment. Under such circumstances, it is necessary to identify each of these conditions, since it may be necessary to treat one, two or even three of the conditions in order to improve functioning. Other complications include depression, sleep problems, social discomfort and self-injurious behavior. Figure 2 provides an algorithmic approach to the management of tic disorders. The appropriate diagnosis of a tic disorder provides an explanation for the bizarre and inexplicable behaviors occurring in these children, who may otherwise appear to be normal.

In our experience, we find that as we intensify our educational efforts toward parents, affected children and school personnel, the number of children who require pharmacologic intervention can be markedly reduced. We have demonstrated that the need for pharmacologic intervention for tics has been reduced by approximately 50 percent over the past 15 years through an aggressive program of providing written information, linking parents with support groups, in-service training for school staff and telephone consultations. BEHAVIOR TREATMENT Positive reinforcement programs appear to be most helpful in the management of tic disorders. Target behaviors may be categorized into two groups: skill deficiencies, or areas that initially require concentration to build social and academic skills; and behavior excesses, in which the goal is to help the patient decrease the frequency of these behaviors.

Caution should be exercised in the management of behavior excesses, since some children who undergo behavior modification to directly target the Tourette's syndrome symptoms have an exacerbation of symptoms.
29. The potent dopamine D 2 antagonist drugs are the most effective in terms of tic reduction but carry the greatest burden of potential side effects. Haloperidol, pimozide and risperidone are frequently used. 30 Side effects include sedation, weight gain, impaired academic performance, social anxiety with school refusal in children and extrapyramidal movement symptoms, including tardive dyskinesia. Clonazepam has some use in the treatment of tics and Tourette's syndrome. Side effects include sedation, weight gain, impaired academic performance, social anxiety with school refusal in children and a worsening of attention in children with comorbid ADHD. The dosage range for clonazepam is 0. 25 mg twice daily to 1 mg three times daily.

### Tourette syndrome: clinical features, pathophysiology, and treatment [^1159eenb]. The Lancet: Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Tourette syndrome is a chronic neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by motor and phonic tics that can substantially diminish the quality of life of affected individuals. Evaluating and treating Tourette syndrome is complex, in part due to the heterogeneity of symptoms and comorbidities between individuals. The underlying pathophysiology of Tourette syndrome is not fully understood, but recent research in the past 5 years has brought new insights into the genetic variations and the alterations in neurophysiology and brain networks contributing to its pathogenesis. Treatment options for Tourette syndrome are expanding with novel pharmacological therapies and increased use of deep brain stimulation for patients with symptoms that are refractory to pharmacological or behavioural treatments. Potential predictors of patient responses to therapies for Tourette syndrome, such as specific networks modulated during deep brain stimulation, can guide clinical decisions. Multicentre data sharing initiatives have enabled several advances in our understanding of the genetics and pathophysiology of Tourette syndrome and will be crucial for future large-scale research and in refining effective treatments.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with tic disorders [^114i2PFy]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Medium credibility.

Comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) with tic disorders — stimulants and alternatives: For children with ADHD, recent studies have demonstrated that tics are not universally increased by stimulant medication; however the FDA package insert for stimulants does list tics as a contraindication. No differences were observed in worsening of tics in children with comorbid ADHD and a chronic tic disorder taking methylphenidate, clonidine, or placebo, with about 20% in each group showing an exacerbation, and the presence of tics appeared to limit the maximum dose achieved. Other options include atomoxetine with reported benefits on tic symptoms as well as ADHD with occasional reports of tics worsening, guanfacine with a clinically relevant effect size for both ADHD and tic symptoms, and tricyclic antidepressants which have shown benefit but whose cardiovascular risks likely outweigh the benefit.

### The ASAM / AAAP clinical practice guideline on the management of stimulant use disorder [^113DVnto]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Appendix E — assessment topics for treatment of stimulant use disorder (StUD) outlines clinical questions to guide evaluation, including what components should be included in the initial assessment for patients presenting with StUD and in the comprehensive assessment for patients with StUD. Questions address baseline laboratory testing — whether it should be conducted for all patients with StUD or based on clinical assessment of risk factors, the effect of conducting baseline laboratory testing when assessing patients with StUD, contextual factors and implementation strategies that may influence its effects, and which baseline laboratory tests are most impactful and appropriate when assessing patients who misuse stimulants. Cardiac evaluation questions ask whether clinicians should routinely request or refer patients for a cardiac evaluation or electrocardiogram (ECG) for patients with stimulant intoxication or withdrawal and for patients with StUD, and the effect of routine screening for cardiac disorders in patients with StUD.

### Management of bleeding diathesis in elective and orthopaedic trauma: a review [^1127b79L]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic Testing

There is general agreement that laboratory testing alone is inadequate. However, 3 inexpensive tests, platelet count (included within complete blood count [CBC]), prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized ratio (INR), and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), can aid in identifying possible patients at risk of bleeding. PT/INR measures the functionality of the extrinsic and common pathway, and aPTT measures the functionality of the intrinsic and common pathways. Many of the common disorders causing bleeding will show an abnormal test result among these 3 routine tests including vWB; hemophilia A, B, and C; DIC; and TIC. -, Acquired bleeding disorders from pharmaceuticals vary by medication mechanism and may not change these common tests. Figure 2 shows a table including some of the most common bleeding conditions and acquired bleeding disorders encountered within orthopaedics and their associated PT and aPTT values.

Figure 2
Table demonstrating commonly encountered bleeding disorders within orthopaedic surgery with their associated laboratory values. Up arrows indicate an increase in the laboratory value, horizontal arrows indicate neutral values, down arrows indicate a decrease in the laboratory value, and a combination of arrows indicate possible variations in the laboratory values. aPTT = activated partial thromboplastin time, CBC = complete blood count, DIC = disseminated intravascular coagulation, INR = international normalized ratio, PT = prothrombin time, vWB = von Willebrand, TIC = trauma-induced coagulopathy, UFH = unfractionated heparin. -,-

vWD is the exception to the commonly presenting orthopaedic hemophilias because it has multiple targeted laboratory results that must be ordered if there is clinical concern. The tests focus on vWF being present within plasma and its functionality. Decreased vWF antigen level, decreased vWF ristocetin cofactor assay, and decreased FVIII:C can be used to identify patients with vWD. Obtaining these tests should be limited to patients without a history of being on anticoagulation medications to avoid unnecessary costs.

### Serum 25-hyroxyvitamin D levels and tic severity in Chinese children with tic disorders [^1161prwZ]. Psychiatry Research (2018). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to evaluate serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D[25(OH)D] levels in children with tic disorders and to explore the relationship between serum 25(OH)D level and tic severity. Children (n = 179, 31 females, 148 males, mean age at diagnosis: 8.0 ± 2.7 years old, age ranged from 3 to 14.5 years old) who were diagnosed with a tic disorder were enrolled as case group, 189 healthy children were recruited as control group. Serum level of 25(OH)D of each child was measured by high performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS) was used to assess tic severity. Mean serum level of 25(OH)D in the case group was significantly lower than that of the control group. The serum 25(OH)D level was significantly associated with tic severity after adjusting for age and body mass index (BMI). This study identified a high prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency in children with tic disorders, and there was a negative correlation between the serum 25(OH)D level and tic severity. In the future, large sample size studies are urgently needed to further clarify this correlation.

### Movement disorders: classifications [^115Lc24R]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2005). Low credibility.

Movement disorders (ataxia, dystonic disorders, gait disorders, Huntington disease, myoclonus, parkinsonism, spasticity, tardive dyskinesia, tics and tremor) are clinically, pathologically and genetically heterogeneous and are characterized by impairment of the planning, control or execution of movement. Current classifications of these disorders have inherent shortcomings due to the complex nature of movement disorders and the lack of diagnostic tests for the majority. Undiscriminating terminology, as well as the clinical, pathological and genetic heterogeneity, further complicate the development of comprehensive categorizations. Modern classification schemes tend to focus on clinical, pathological or genetic/molecular criteria, but more recent attempts have been made to integrate across these levels. From a historical perspective, two 'golden ages' have shaped the current and evolving classification schemes: (1) the definition of clinical pathological entities in the early twentieth century and (2) the application of molecular neurogenetics in the past 10–15 years. However, the classification of movement disorders on clinical grounds (according to age at onset, distribution of symptoms, disease course, provoking factors and therapeutic response) remains one of the most useful modes of categorization. Postmortem criteria have been employed to distinguish between degenerative and nondegenerative disorders, and specific hallmarks may be required to establish or confirm a diagnosis. Genetic features used for classification purposes include mode of inheritance and molecular genetic data, such as linkage to a known gene locus or identification of a specific genetic defect. A final classification scheme is based on alterations in molecular mechanisms (e.g. trinucleotide expansions) or protein function (e.g. channelopathies). Despite recent advances, it may not be possible to develop the 'ultimate' classification of movement disorders, and different patterns of lumping and splitting may be useful for the clinician, the pathologist or the geneticist/molecular biologist. Furthermore, certain individual cases with unique features may not fit into any particular category. Continued research by both clinicians and basic scientists is necessary in order to refine and redefine classification schemes of movement disorders.

### The most cited works in tourette syndrome [^1117h6KQ]. Journal of Child Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

The impact of scientific articles is proportional to the citations they have received. In this study, the most cited works ("citation classics") related to Tourette syndrome (TS) were identified as articles with more than 100 citations according to the Web of Science. We retrieved 89 highly cited articles, which were published in 26 journals: 54 clinical studies, 27 laboratory studies, 7 reviews, and 1 classification article. Clinical studies consisted of phenomenologic evaluations of TS and comorbid behavioral problems (n = 22) and studies on pharmacotherapy (n = 16) and clinical genetics (n = 13), whereas laboratory studies covered basic genetics, cellular and molecular biology (n = 11), and neurobiology (neuroimaging, neuropathology, and neurophysiology) (n = 16). The majority (58%) of citation classics were published after 1990, when laboratory studies (especially neuroimaging, immunologic, and genetic studies) became widely cited. These articles are able to reach the highest numbers of citations in a short time span and suggest potential directions for future research.

### Quality improvement in neurology: child neurology quality measure set: executive summary [^115TjqY2]. Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Tic disorders (TDs) and TS — epidemiology, course, comorbidity, and care gaps are highlighted as follows: prevalence is estimated between 0.3% and 1% of the population, they occur more frequently in boys than girls, and TDs often resolve in childhood but may persist into later adult life. TS and TDs are associated with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and mood disorders including depression and anxiety, yet the rate at which screening for these conditions occurs is unknown and effective behavioral interventions to reduce the frequency of tics and improve quality of life are likely underutilized.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with tic disorders [^114cKnVi]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Medium credibility.

Tic disorders — etiology and neurophysiology — are characterized by evidence for dysfunctional cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuits and altered motor network activity. There is evidence that motor programs at both a cortical and subcortical level are not properly modulated, and tics are proposed to result from dysfunctional cortico-striatal-thalamo-cortical circuits. MRI morphometric studies have shown loss of normal caudate asymmetry, functional neuroimaging has revealed decreased basal ganglia activity with a left-sided preponderance often noted, and greater activity in sensorimotor regions with reduced caudate activation during spontaneous tics suggests deficient engagement of inhibitory circuits. During motor tasks a larger cortical area was recruited in TD than controls; transcranial magnetic stimulation showed a shortened cortical silent period and reduced intracortical inhibition while motor threshold and peripheral motor excitability did not differ from controls; during tic suppression, signal changes in basal ganglia and thalamus were inversely correlated with tic severity. Family studies suggest a 10 to 100 fold increase in the risk of CTD among first-degree relatives compared to the general population.

### European Society for the Study of Tourette Syndrome 2022 criteria for clinical diagnosis of functional tic-like behaviours: international consensus from experts in tic disorders [^114Bsat6]. European Journal of Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background and Purpose

In 2020, health professionals witnessed a dramatic increase in referrals of young people with rapid onset of severe tic-like behaviours. We assembled a working group to develop criteria for the clinical diagnosis of functional tic-like behaviours (FTLBs) to help neurologists, pediatricians, psychiatrists, and psychologists recognize and diagnose this condition.

Methods

We used a formal consensus development process, using a multiround, web-based Delphi survey. The survey was based on an in-person discussion at the European Society for the Study of Tourette Syndrome (ESSTS) meeting in Lausanne in June 2022. Members of an invited group with extensive clinical experience working with patients with Tourette syndrome and FTLBs discussed potential clinical criteria for diagnosis of FTLBs. An initial set of criteria were developed based on common clinical experiences and review of the literature on FTLBs and revised through iterative discussions, resulting in the survey items for voting.

Results

In total, 24 members of the working group were invited to participate in the Delphi process. We propose that there are three major criteria and two minor criteria to support the clinical diagnosis of FTLBs. A clinically definite diagnosis of FTLBs can be confirmed by the presence of all three major criteria. A clinically probable diagnosis of FTLBs can be confirmed by the presence of two major criteria and one minor criterion.

Conclusions

Distinguishing FTLBs from primary tics is important due to the distinct treatment paths required for these two conditions. A limitation of the ESSTS 2022 criteria is that they lack prospective testing of their sensitivity and specificity.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with tic disorders [^115hBz5w]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Medium credibility.

Tic disorders — childhood onset and diagnostic classification — are long-lasting neuropsychiatric disorders typically of childhood onset (< 18 years) characterized by multiple motor and/or vocal/phonic tics that wax and wane and are often accompanied by behavioral problems including attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). Persistent motor or vocal tic disorder has tics limited to one domain, whereas Tourette's disorder (TD) has both motor and vocal tics at some point in the illness. For either diagnosis, tics need to be present for at least one year; for tics present for less than 1 year, provisional tic disorder (formerly transient tic disorder) is used. Other specified tic disorder or unspecified tic disorder diagnoses are used for presentations that do not meet full criteria for TD, persistent tic disorder, or provisional tic disorder, and in other specified tic disorder clinicians specify the reason the full criteria were not met.

### PANDAS anorexia nervosa – endangered, extinct or nonexistent? [^1159VhfV]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

Substantial evidence exists for the concept of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptoccoccal infection (PANDAS) such as some cases of obsessive-compulsive disorder and tics/Tourette's syndrome. More recently PANDAS-AN has been described. The aim of this article is to provide a critical review of this concept.

Method

The literature was searched using Medline, Psychinfo, and Google.

Results

There is some evidence for the entity of PANDAS-AN but this is considerably limited by a wide range of methodological problems, including the seemingly low prevalence, the lack of clarity in diagnostic criteria, and the lack of specificity in the diagnostic tests. Innovative treatment approaches hold promise but require further evaluation.

Conclusion

Further research into PANDAS-AN, using more clearly defined and consistent diagnostic criteria is needed, given the potential for enhancing the understanding of the pathogenesis of AN and for more effective treatments.

### Practice guideline recommendations summary: treatment of tics in people with tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorders [^111VBq1n]. Neurology (2019). High credibility.

American Academy of Neurology (AAN) practice guideline — treatment of tics in Tourette syndrome (TS) and chronic tic disorders — frames recommendations around two guiding questions regarding "In children and adults with TS or a chronic tic disorder, when should clinicians and patients pursue treatment for tics?" and "In children and adults with TS or a chronic tic disorder who require treatment for tics, how should clinicians and patients choose between evidence-based treatment options and determine the sequence or combinations of these treatments?". Recommendation premises include evidence-based conclusions (EVID), principles of care (PRIN), strong evidence from related conditions (RELA), and deductive inferences (INFER), and "Recommendations must always be supported by at least one premise". When sufficient evidence supports an intervention, "the development panel assigns one of 3 recommendation designations: A, B, or C", and "Each designation corresponds to a helping verb that denotes the level of strength of the recommendation", with "Level A… denoted by the use of the verb must", "Level B corresponds to the verb should", and "Level C corresponds to the verb may"; Level A recommendations "are rare because they are based on high confidence in the evidence and require both a high magnitude of benefit and low risk". In addition, non–evidence-based considerations explicitly include "the relative value of the benefit compared with the risk", "the feasibility of complying with the intervention", "the cost of the intervention", and "the expected variation in patient preferences relative to the risks, burdens, and benefits of the intervention".

### Practice guideline recommendations summary: treatment of tics in people with tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorders [^111oTxeF]. Neurology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To make recommendations on the assessment and management of tics in people with Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorders.

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel consisting of 9 physicians, 2 psychologists, and 2 patient representatives developed practice recommendations, integrating findings from a systematic review and following an Institute of Medicine-compliant process to ensure transparency and patient engagement. Recommendations were supported by structured rationales, integrating evidence from the systematic review, related evidence, principles of care, and inferences from evidence.

Results

Forty-six recommendations were made regarding the assessment and management of tics in individuals with Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorders. These include counseling recommendations on the natural history of tic disorders, psychoeducation for teachers and peers, assessment for comorbid disorders, and periodic reassessment of the need for ongoing therapy. Treatment options should be individualized, and the choice should be the result of a collaborative decision among patient, caregiver, and clinician, during which the benefits and harms of individual treatments as well as the presence of comorbid disorders are considered. Treatment options include watchful waiting, the Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics, and medication; recommendations are provided on how to offer and monitor these therapies. Recommendations on the assessment for and use of deep brain stimulation in adults with severe, treatment-refractory tics are provided as well as suggestions for future research.

### Efficacy and safety of fixed-dose deutetrabenazine in children and adolescents for tics associated with tourette syndrome: a randomized clinical trial [^115mi1Pe]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Safety Assessments

The incidence of AEs was assessed from informed consent signing to the end of the follow-up period. Preferred AE terms and system organ classes were coded using terminology from MedDRA, version 22.1 (International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations). Treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) were defined as AEs that began or worsened after first administration of the study drug. All TEAEs were considered treatment-related if the investigator assessed the events as having a reasonable possibility of being caused by the study drug. Standardized MedDRA queries for TEAEs of depression and suicide or self-injury were summarized.

The Children's Depression Inventory 2 parent and self-report versions were used to assess depressive symptoms and depression-related behaviors. The children's Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale was used to assess past and current suicidal ideation and behaviors to determine suicide risk. Observed values and changes from baseline were assessed for vital signs, electrocardiogram parameters, and clinical laboratory parameters.

Statistical Analysis

It was estimated that approximately 50 participants per study group would provide at least 90% power to detect a beneficial effect of at least 6.5 points in the change from baseline to week 8 in YGTSS-TTS for high-dose deutetrabenazine compared with placebo, assuming an SD of 9.5 and a 2-sided type 1 error rate of 5%, after accounting for dropouts.

The intention-to-treat (ITT) population included all randomized participants. Efficacy analyses were performed for the modified ITT population, defined as all participants in the ITT population who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had a baseline and at least 1 postbaseline YGTSS assessment. The safety population included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of study drug.

### Overuse of EEG in the evaluation of common neurologic conditions [^111VognA]. Pediatric Neurology (2002). Low credibility.

The objective of the present study was to analyze the diagnostic indications that most often prompt the referral of children and adolescents in the outpatient clinical pediatric practice for electroencephalographic evaluation and to check its utility in these clinical conditions. The electroencephalographic records of 547 consecutive children and adolescents (5–16 years of age) referred to a single community laboratory for the evaluation of various neurologic disorders were prospectively read by a single blinded investigator. Common diagnostic indications included the following: clinical seizures (42%), attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder (23%), headaches (10.4%), syncope (9.9%), and tic disorder (4.9%). Overall, 76% of records were normal. Slowing of electroencephalographic activity was noted in 1% (attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder) to 26% (probable epilepsy), and epileptiform activity in 53% of the probable and 29% of the clinically possible epileptics. Epileptiform activity was rarely found in the nonepileptic patients. The results of the present study demonstrate that standard interictal electroencephalogram is being overused during evaluation of various neurologic disorders in children and adolescents, suggesting that its use should be reserved for supporting the diagnosis in those cases in which epilepsy is a reasonable clinical possibility.

### Evidence-based assessment of tourette syndrome [^115WnGrh]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2025). Medium credibility.

Tourette syndrome and persistent tic disorders (collectively, TS) are impairing childhood-onset neuropsychiatric conditions. Utilizing evidence-based assessments (EBA) is standard for effective and accurate screening, diagnosis, and monitoring of TS. EBAs consist of brief screening instruments, structured/semi-structured clinician-administered interviews, self-report, and parent-report and child-report. This article provides an overview of the quality, utility, and psychometric properties of available assessments to determine the presence of TS, evaluate symptom severity, and capture associated phenomenology (eg, premonitory urges, quality of life). The article concludes with considerations for best clinical practices and future directions for the EBA of TS.

### Distinguishing functional from primary tics: a study of expert video assessments [^115XEszQ]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Tic disorders are among the most common hyperkinetic movement disorders in childhood and may also affect adults with a direct impact on their health and quality of life. The most prevalent tic aetiologies are primary tic disorders, such as Tourette syndrome (TS), but there is a wide range of differential diagnoses, including functional neurological disorder. Historically, the issue of functional tics has been at the centre of a prolonged and heated debate both in neurology and psychiatry with particular focus on the diagnostic classifiers of such cases and their clinical and pathophysiological distinction from primary tics. However, perhaps owing to the lack of more advanced neuroscientific and therapeutic tools at the time, this faded from focus for a longer period. In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in this discourse, specifically triggered by the growing incidence of cases with atypical characteristics from those observed in primary tic disorders. Moreover, during the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an even greater increase of such cases, many of which have attracted the attention of millions in social media, further fuelling the old discussion as to how to distinguish functional from primary tics.

To date, several phenomenological classifiers have been proposed to discern primary tic phenomena from functional tics. These diagnostic aids have been developed by observing the typical patterns of tics documented in people with primary tic disorders and contrasting these to movements and behaviours that grossly differ. However, in the absence of an established diagnostic standard or biomarker for either aetiology, the validity of such classifiers remains uncertain. Moreover, there is little consensus as to the exact phenomenological boundaries between primary and functional tics. Importantly, it remains unclear how to diagnostically approach cases where primary tics may coexist with functional tics, even though the combination is not uncommon. According to a recent international survey of members of the Movement Disorders Society, the second most common differential diagnosis to primary tics was functional tics, and the coexistence of the two diagnoses was reported to be as high as 25%.

The mean percentages for the AGREE II domain scores were: scope and purpose 83.33% (95% confidence interval [CI] 77.78–94.44%), stakeholder involvement 62.22% (95% CI, 38.89–94.44%), rigor of development 47.08% (95% CI, 6.25–83.33%), clarity of presentation 87.78% (95% CI, 72.22–94.44%), applicability 56.67% (95% CI, 33.33–87.50%), and editorial independence 46.67% (95% CI, 8.33–91.67%). There were large differences among the five CPGs concerning the categorization of evidence and recommendations. The recommendations for drug therapy were similar in all five CPGs, although there was controversy in certain areas. The methodological quality of CPGs for TDs was acceptable in terms of scope and purpose, stakeholder involvement, and clarity of presentation. However, CPG developers need to pay more attention to rigorous development processes, applicability, and editorial independence. Developers of future CPGs should improve adherence to the AGREE II guidelines. In addition, high quality studies on the treatment of TDs are needed to provide more evidence for developing guidelines.

### Streptococcal infection and exacerbations of childhood tics and obsessive-compulsive symptoms: a prospective blinded cohort study [^117DqLDS]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

If pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections is a unique clinical entity, we hypothesized that children meeting diagnostic criteria would have more clinical exacerbations temporally linked to bona fide group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus infection than matched control subjects (chronic tic and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder with no known temporal relationship to group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus infection).

Patients and Methods

Subjects included 40 matched pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections case-control pairs who were prospectively evaluated with intensive laboratory testing for group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus and clinical measures for an average of 2 years. Additional testing occurred at the time of any clinical exacerbations or illness. Laboratory personnel were blinded to case or control status and clinical (exacerbation or not) condition. Clinical raters were blinded to the results of laboratory tests.

Results

The cases had a higher clinical exacerbation rate and a higher bona fide group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus infection rate than the control group. Only 5 of 64 exacerbations were temporally associated (within 4 weeks) with a group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus infection, and all occurred in cases. The number (5.0) was significantly higher than the number that would be expected by chance alone (1.6). Yet, ≥ 75% of the clinical exacerbations in cases had no observable temporal relationship to group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus infection.

Conclusions

Patients who fit published criteria for pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections seem to represent a subgroup of those with chronic tic disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder who may be vulnerable to group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus infection as a precipitant of neuropsychiatric symptom exacerbations. Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus infection is not the only or even the most common antecedent event associated with exacerbations for these patients. Additional intensive studies are needed to determine whether there is clinical or scientific evidence to support separating out subgroups of tic disorder and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder patients based on specific symptom precipitants.

### Developing a phenotype risk score for tic disorders in a large, clinical biobank [^113W7axT]. Translational Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Ultimately, we find that leveraging the dense phenotype information in a large, clinical biobank can replicate the phenotypic findings of prior studies of TD patients, while adding longitudinal medical outcomes. In addition to the utility of the biobank for research purposes, these tools may also benefit clinicians and TD patients. Our PheWAS reveals multiple comorbid psychiatric phenotypes with TD, which could help clinicians more thoroughly evaluate TD patients and provide necessary interventions and treatments in a timelier manner. The PheRS serves as a quantitative measure encapsulating the broad medical phenome for a given disease. Because the PheRS is diagnosis agnostic and can be applied to target populations with any sample size, this tool could be advantageous for evaluating disease risk based purely on the presentation of phenotypes and provides a phenome-wide perspective when evaluating complex disorders.

### Management of bleeding diathesis in elective and orthopaedic trauma: a review [^111ubjuv]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). Medium credibility.

The approach taken should include the following protocol, as described in Figure 3: If a patient has undergone surgical intervention in the past with no changes in their medical history, standard management can be used. If an appropriate elevation in aPTT and/or PT is present secondary to a pharmaceutically acquired bleeding disorder, we should proceed with routine reversal or holding the medications preoperatively as indicated. If the history is positive and an outpatient procedure is planned, the tests mentioned above should be obtained and hematology should be consulted for preoperative optimization. Supplementing with the following laboratory results may expedite the diagnostic process: factor IV activity, alpha 2-antiplasmin activity, von Willebrand factor activity, and Platelet Function Analyzer-100. Targeted or activated factor levels should be obtained preoperatively if a patient has a known factor disorder. It is common for factor activity laboratory results to take longer to achieve results than other basic clinic laboratory results. Therefore, early, preoperative planning, if possible, is a necessity.

Viscoelastic assays such as thromboelastrography (TEG) act as point-of-care measurements that allow targeted resuscitation. TEG can help identify the type of blood product needed for expedient transfusion and resuscitation of a patient based on their coagulation status. This method of resuscitation can be beneficial in the setting of a patient with TIC or DIC or in the setting of urgent surgical treatment. Multiple centers have developed protocols that can be replicated to use TEG in the trauma setting.D-dimer can be helpful to diagnose DIC or TIC in the preoperative setting because it will be elevated, but postoperatively, it is typically elevated to the level of a consumptive coagulopathy and lacks clinical utility.

### Pimozide [^117U8RiL]. FDA (2017). Low credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

General The suppression of tics by pimozide tablets, USP requires a slow and gradual introduction of the drug. The patient's dose should be carefully adjusted to a point where the suppression of tics and the relief afforded is balanced against the untoward side effects of the drug.

An ECG should be done at baseline and periodically thereafter, especially during the period of dose adjustment (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS - Laboratory Tests). Periodic attempts should be made to reduce the dosage of pimozide tablets, USP to see whether or not tics persist at the level and extent first identified. In attempts to reduce the dosage of pimozide tablets, USP consideration should be given to the possibility that increases of tic intensity and frequency may represent a transient, withdrawal related phenomenon rather than a return of disease symptoms. Specifically, one to two weeks should be allowed to elapse before one concludes that an increase in tic manifestations is a function of the underlying disease syndrome rather than a response to drug withdrawal. A gradual withdrawal is recommended in any case.

Children Reliable dose response data for the effects of pimozide tablets, USP on tic manifestation in Tourette's Disorder patients below the age of twelve are not available.

Treatment should be initiated at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg preferably taken once at bedtime. The dose may be increased every third day to a maximum of 0.2 mg/kg not to exceed 10 mg/day. At doses above 0.05 mg/kg/day, CYP 2D6 genotyping should be performed. In poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers, pimozide tablets, USP doses should not exceed 0.05 mg/kg/day, and doses should not be increased earlier than 14 days (see PRECAUTIONS – Pharmacogenomics).

Adults

In general, treatment with pimozide tablets, USP should be initiated with a dose of 1 to 2 mg a day in divided doses. The dose may be increased thereafter every other day. Most patients are maintained at less than 0.2 mg/kg/day, or 10 mg/day, whichever is less. Doses greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/day are not recommended.

At doses above 4 mg/day, CYP 2D6 genotyping should be performed. In poor CYP 2D6 metabolizers, pimozide tablets, USP doses should not exceed 4 mg/day, and doses should not be increased earlier than 14 days (see PRECAUTIONS – Pharmacogenomics).

### Tourette syndrome: clinical spectrum, mechanisms and personalized treatments [^1137WeGR]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To describe recent advances regarding the disease spectrum in Tourette syndrome, offer new mechanistic insights into tic generation and provide clues for personalized treatments in this disorder.

Recent Findings

Apart from tics, which define Tourette syndrome, comorbidities are the rule and not the exception. They significantly define clinical presentation, disease severity and quality of life. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of screening for depression, anxiety and autism spectrum disorders in Tourette syndrome. Regarding the mechanisms of tic generation, computational models begin to emerge and provide important clues regarding the cerebral regions and networks involved, as well as information on the nature of neurotransmitter signaling, for instance phasic versus tonic dopamine release. Also, these models may inform on generation or termination of premonitory urges which underlie tic generation. Finally, personalized treatments in Tourette syndrome are both necessary because of the width of the clinical spectrum, making every patient unique from a symptom-oriented perspective; yet, difficult to achieve because of the lack of large prospective cohorts which may inform on prognostic factors and disease-modifying interventions. However, interesting developments, especially in the fields of behavioral therapy and deep brain stimulation, deserve mention and pave the way for tailored treatments in Tourette syndrome.

Summary

The recent literature offers interesting clues that sharpen our understanding of comorbidities in Tourette disorder and thereby its clinical spectrum, offers insights into the cerebral networks underlying tic generation and cautiously announces personalized interventions for Tourette disorder patients based on their symptom profile.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with tic disorders [^114dTdUu]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Medium credibility.

Assessment for tic disorders in children and adolescents — Recommendation 1. The psychiatric assessment should involve routine screening for unusual movements, stereotypies, tics, and family history of tic disorders. [CS] Commonly used parent-rated behavioral screening tools such as the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and the 90-item version of the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham (SNAP) include tic-specific questions, and rating scales specific for tics may be used; for clinician-rated tic severity, the most commonly used is the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS), which assesses the nature of motor and phonic tics over the previous week. The Tourette Syndrome Severity Scale (TSSS) contains 5 ordinal scales with differing ranges and item weights that focus on TD-related social impairment, and the Tourette Syndrome Global Scale (TSGS) assesses the frequency and impairment of simple and complex tics, as well as common comorbid problems (e.g., behavioral problems, functional impairment).

### Quality improvement in neurology: child neurology quality measure set: executive summary [^114S6mcY]. Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Tic disorders (TD) — common comorbidities and practical evaluation are noted. TD is the most common movement disorder seen by child neurologists and is seen transiently in childhood and includes tics. Although many childhood tics are self-limiting, common comorbidities include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and mood disorders like anxiety and depression; evaluation is possible by asking relatively simple outpatient questions with referral as needed.

### Practice guideline recommendations summary: treatment of tics in people with tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorders [^114cYfxG]. Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorders — treatment recommendations summary: Forty-six recommendations were made regarding the assessment and management of tics in individuals with Tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorders. Recommendations include counseling on the natural history of tic disorders, psychoeducation for teachers and peers, assessment for comorbid disorders, and periodic reassessment of the need for ongoing therapy. Treatment options should be individualized, and the choice should be the result of a collaborative decision among patient, caregiver, and clinician, during which the benefits and harms of individual treatments as well as the presence of comorbid disorders are considered. Treatment modalities include watchful waiting, the Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics, and medication, with recommendations provided on how to offer and monitor these therapies. Recommendations on the assessment for and use of deep brain stimulation in adults with severe, treatment-refractory tics are provided.

### Differential diagnosis of dystonia [^115Gv5KY]. European Journal of Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by sustained muscle contractions causing twisting and repetitive movements and abnormal postures. Diagnosing dystonia may be difficult, because of variability of dystonia presentation, uncertain recognition of the specific clinical signs, wide etiological spectrum, and coexistence of other movement disorders. The major difficulties in the diagnostic assessment of primary and non-primary dystonia derive from its confusion with other movement disorders or with a psychogenic disorder. The clinical heterogeneity of dystonia and some examples of misdiagnosis are reviewed here. The movement disorders that can be most commonly taken for dystonia are tremor, Parkinson's disease, myoclonus, chorea, and tics. Given the occurrence of confounding factors, along with specific genetic and laboratory test, it is of great importance to apply a specific algorithm to recognize the clinical signs of dystonia.

### Clinical decision-making in functional and hyperkinetic movement disorders [^116tBbbh]. Neurology (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

Functional or psychogenic movement disorders (FMD) present a diagnostic challenge. To diagnose FMD, clinicians must have experience with signs typical of FMD and distinguishing features from other hyperkinetic disorders. The aim of this study was to clarify the decision-making process of expert clinicians while diagnosing FMD, myoclonus, and tics.

Methods

Thirty-nine movement disorders experts rated 60 patients using a standardized web-based survey resembling clinical practice. It provided 5 steps of incremental information: (1) visual first impression of the patient, (2) medical history, (3) neurologic examination on video, (4) the Bereitschaftspotential (BP), and (5) psychiatric evaluation. After full evaluation of each case, experts were asked which diagnostic step was decisive. In addition, interim switches in diagnosis after each informational step were calculated.

Results

After full evaluation, the experts annotated the first impression of the patients as decisive in 18.5% of cases. Medical history was considered decisive in 33.3% of cases. Neurologic examination was considered decisive in 39.7%, the BP in 8%, and the psychiatric interview in 0.5% of cases. Most diagnostic switches occurred after addition of the medical history (34.5%). Addition of the neurologic examination led to 13.8% of diagnostic switches. The BP results led to diagnostic switches in 7.2% of cases. Psychiatric evaluation resulted in the lowest number of diagnostic switches (2.7% of cases).

Conclusions

Experts predominantly rely on clinical assessment to diagnose FMD. Importantly, ancillary tests do not determine the final diagnosis of this expert panel. In general, the experts infrequently changed their differential diagnosis.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with tic disorders [^1179XJYW]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Medium credibility.

Medical and substance-related evaluation — Recommendation 3. The assessment for tic disorders should involve a careful examination for general medical condition or substance etiology. [CS] A medical workup should be considered for new-onset tics or tic-like movements, and certain clinical features such as the sudden onset of severe tics, atypical tics, or mental status abnormalities suggestive of an organic process (i.e., disorientation, inability to copy figures or to draw a clock) should prompt further medical investigation. Basic laboratory measures such as a hemogram, renal/hepatic function panel, thyroid panel, and ferritin, along with urine drug screen for adolescents, are reasonable, and for new sudden (overnight)-onset or severe symptom exacerbation, the provider may assess for co-occurring infection with diagnostic tests that indicate acute illness (e.g., culture, rapid viral tests). EEG and brain imaging are not routinely recommended and are reserved for cases with other neurological findings, and in cases with unusual or complex presentations, additional specialty consultation (e.g., pediatric neurology, genetics) may be helpful.

### Practice guideline recommendations summary: treatment of tics in people with tourette syndrome and chronic tic disorders [^1139iCVV]. Neurology (2019). High credibility.

Antipsychotic therapy for tics — cardiac monitoring and discontinuation — states that physicians prescribing antipsychotics for tics must perform electrocardiography and measure the QTc interval before and after starting pimozide or ziprasidone, or if antipsychotics are coadministered with other drugs that can prolong the QT interval (Level A). When attempting to discontinue antipsychotics for tics, physicians should gradually taper medications over weeks to months to avoid withdrawal dyskinesias (Level B).

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with tic disorders [^113KNb7u]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2013). Medium credibility.

Tic disorders — epidemiology and natural history — average age of onset and course include an onset at 7 years with possible onset as early as a few months of age; prevalence and severity peak at 9 to 12 years and remit or markedly attenuate in most individuals (65%) by age 18 to 20 years. Prevalence estimates indicate CTD 0.5% to 3% and approximately 7% of school age children having had tics in the previous year, with transient tics approximately 5%. Population rates for all tics range from 5.9% to 18% for boys and from 2.9% to 11% for girls, and CTD shows a male preponderance with a gender ratio of at least 2:1 or higher. Although ethnic differences are understudied, available studies found higher rates in white compared to African American youth.
