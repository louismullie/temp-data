BAT score
ICH score

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which option can be used to predict hematoma expansion when CT angiography (CTA) is not available, with options including GCS, the CTA spot sign, the BAT score, and the ICH score. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the constraint that CTA is unavailable and therefore prioritize noncontrast CT (NCCT)-based predictors. Then, I should verify what each option is designed to predict and on which modality it relies. Next, I will review the validation evidence and performance characteristics for NCCT-based tools. Finally, I will confirm why the alternatives do not meet the question's requirement and state the most appropriate choice.

> Let me first confirm the core constraint: if CTA is not available, CTA-dependent biomarkers like the spot sign cannot be applied, so I need to focus on NCCT-only approaches for hematoma expansion prediction, not just general prognostic scales for mortality or disability.

> Wait, let me verify the status of the CTA spot sign before excluding it outright; the spot sign requires contrast-enhanced CTA and its predictive performance is time- and protocol-dependent, so by definition it is unusable when CTA cannot be performed, which means it cannot satisfy the scenario as posed [^114AstxZ] [^111XkGcT] [^116zdQCv].

> I will now examine the BAT score carefully; the BAT score is an NCCT-based, 5-point score specifically derived to predict hematoma expansion using readily available noncontrast CT features and very early imaging, allocating 1 point for blend sign, 2 points for any intrahematomal hypodensity, and 2 points for NCCT within 2.5 hours of onset, with discrimination around c-statistic 0.77 in derivation and 0.65–0.70 in validation cohorts, which directly matches the "no CTA" use-case described [^116M14W5].

> Hold on, let me not jump to conclusions about general scales; GCS is a neurologic severity score and the ICH score is a composite prognostic tool for mortality and outcome, not a tool designed to predict radiographic hematoma expansion per se, so neither fulfills the question's request for an expansion predictor when CTA is unavailable [^116aq1VL].

> Next, I should review the broader NCCT evidence to ensure BAT's components are biologically and empirically plausible; NCCT features such as hypodensities, blend sign, and heterogeneity have been repeatedly associated with hematoma expansion, and formal standards and subsequent work confirm the utility and reliability of NCCT markers, which reinforces why an NCCT composite like BAT is appropriate when CTA cannot be obtained [^114X8eq6] [^113PCLWk].

> Let me consider whether other NCCT-based expansion scores could compete here; the HEP score and other NCCT expansion models exist, but the option provided in the stem that was explicitly designed for NCCT-only prediction and validated across cohorts is the BAT score, aligning most directly with the question's constraints and intent [^113mtxvz] [^116M14W5].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should double-check the timing element embedded in BAT because early imaging increases expansion risk; yes, BAT intentionally weights onset-to-NCCT time ≤ 2.5 hours to capture the steep early risk window, which is consistent with meta-analytic data on time-dependent expansion risk, further supporting its construct validity in the absence of CTA [^116M14W5] [^112XNcck].

> Putting it all together, when CTA is unavailable, the BAT score is the correct, evidence-based predictor of hematoma expansion because it relies solely on NCCT features and early imaging timing, whereas GCS and the ICH score address global prognosis and the spot sign requires CTA and thus cannot be used in this setting [^116M14W5] [^116aq1VL] [^115XsSDB] [^111XkGcT].

In the absence of CT angiography, the **BAT score** [^116M14W5] is the best validated tool to predict hematoma expansion after intracerebral hemorrhage, using non-contrast CT features and time to imaging [^113aii7N]. The BAT score combines blend sign, intrahematoma hypodensity, and onset-to-CT < 2.5 hours, with a **score ≥ 3 indicating high risk** (specificity 89%, sensitivity 50) [^116M14W5]. The **spot sign requires CTA** and is not available on NCCT [^111XkGcT]; the ICH score and GCS are prognostic, not expansion-specific [^116aq1VL].

---

## Non-contrast CT markers and clinical predictors

Several NCCT markers and clinical factors are **predictors of hematoma expansion** [^116nY2Hw]:

- **Blend sign**: A hypoattenuating area blending with hyperattenuating hematoma, indicating active bleeding [^111hsALV].

- **Intrahematoma hypodensity**: Hypodense regions within the hematoma, suggesting ongoing bleeding [^116M14W5] [^112USuii].

- **Time from symptom onset to CT**: Shorter onset-to-CT time (< 2.5 hours) is associated with higher risk of expansion [^112XNcck].

## BAT score: a validated NCCT-based prediction tool

The **BAT score** combines NCCT markers and clinical factors to predict hematoma expansion:

| **Predictor** | **Points** |
|-|-|
| Blend sign | 1 |
| Intrahematoma hypodensity | 2 |
| Onset-to-CT < 2.5 hours | 2 |

---

For the **BAT score**, a score ≥ 3 indicates high risk of hematoma expansion, with specificity of 89% and sensitivity of 50% [^116M14W5].

---

## Comparison with other clinical scores

The **ICH score** is primarily a prognostic tool for mortality and functional outcome and is not specifically designed to predict hematoma expansion [^116aq1VL]. In contrast, the **GCS** is a general measure of consciousness and severity and is not specific for hematoma expansion prediction [^116nY2Hw].

---

## Summary of predictive tools

| **Tool** | **Purpose** | **Availability** | **Predictive accuracy** |
|-|-|-|-|
| BAT score | Hematoma expansion | NCCT | High specificity (89%), moderate sensitivity (50) [^116M14W5] |
| Spot sign | Hematoma expansion | CTA | High specificity, moderate sensitivity [^111NsDB3] [^111XkGcT] |
| ICH score | Mortality, functional outcome | Clinical | Not specific for expansion [^116aq1VL] |
| GCS | General severity | Clinical | Not specific for expansion [^116nY2Hw] |

When CT angiography is unavailable, the **BAT score** is the best validated and practical tool for predicting hematoma expansion after intracerebral hemorrhage, using NCCT markers and clinical factors [^116M14W5] [^116NNrbx].

### Predicting intracerebral hemorrhage expansion with noncontrast computed tomography: The BAT score [^116M14W5]. Stroke (2018). Low credibility.

Although computed tomographic angiography spot sign performs well as a biomarker for hematoma expansion (HE), it is not routinely conducted in emergency settings. We developed and validated a score to predict HE based on noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) findings in spontaneous acute intracerebral hemorrhage.

- **Methods**: After developing the score in a single-center cohort of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (n = 344), we validated it in a large clinical trial population (n = 954) and in a multicenter intracerebral hemorrhage cohort (n = 241). The NCCT markers analyzed included hypodensities, blend sign, hematoma shape and density, and fluid level. HE was defined as hematoma growth greater than 6 mL or more than 33%. The score was created using estimates from multivariable logistic regression after selecting final predictors from bootstrap samples.

- **Results**: The presence of blend sign (odds ratio, 3.09; 95% confidence interval, 1.49–6.40; P = 0.002), any intrahematoma hypodensity (odds ratio, 4.54; 95% CI, 2.44–8.43; P < 0.0001), and time from onset to NCCT less than 2.5 hours (odds ratio, 3.73; 95% CI, 1.86–7.51; P = 0.0002) were identified as predictors of HE. A 5-point BAT score was established, allocating 1 point for the blend sign, 2 points for any hypodensity, and 2 points for NCCT conducted within 2.5 hours from onset. The c statistic recorded was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.70–0.83) in the development population, and 0.65 (95% CI, 0.61–0.68) and 0.70 (95% CI, 0.64–0.77) in the two validation cohorts. A dichotomized score (BAT score ≥ 3) predicted HE with 0.50 sensitivity and 0.89 specificity.

### Intracerebral hematoma morphologic appearance on noncontrast computed tomography predicts significant hematoma expansion [^114X8eq6]. Stroke (2015). Low credibility.

Hematoma expansion in intracerebral hemorrhage is associated with higher morbidity and mortality. Although the computed tomography (CT) angiographic spot sign is highly predictive of expansion, other morphological features of intracerebral hemorrhage, such as fluid levels, density heterogeneity, and margin irregularity, may also predict expansion, particularly in centers where CT angiography is not readily available.

- **Methods**: Baseline noncontrast CT scans from patients enrolled in the Predicting Hematoma Growth and Outcome in Intracerebral Hemorrhage Using Contrast Bolus CT (PREDICT) study were assessed for the presence of fluid levels and the degree of density heterogeneity and margin irregularity using previously validated scales. The presence and grade of these metrics were correlated with hematoma expansion as defined by the PREDICT study on a 24-hour follow-up scan.

- **Results**: Three hundred eleven patients were included in the analysis. The presence of fluid levels and increasing heterogeneity and irregularity were associated with 24-hour hematoma expansion (P = 0.021, 0.003, and 0.049, respectively), as well as increases in absolute hematoma size. Fluid levels had the highest positive predictive value (50%; 28%-71%), whereas margin irregularity had the highest negative predictive value (78%; 71%-85%). Noncontrast metrics had comparable predictive values to the spot sign for expansion when controlled for vitamin K, antiplatelet use, and baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale.

### Noncontrast computed tomography markers as predictors of revised hematoma expansion in acute intracerebral hemorrhage [^111hsALV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 21.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL) and MedCalc version 11.4.2. The performances of blend sign, black hole sign, island sign, and expansion-prone hematoma for predicting IVH growth and RHE were evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated to evaluate the predictive performance.

- **Categorical variables**: All categorical variables, such as sex, alcohol consumption, smoking, diabetes mellitus, history of hypertension, presence of IVH on initial CT, NCCT markers, expansion-prone hematoma, poor outcome, and ICH location, were compared using the χ² test or the Fisher exact test, where appropriate.

- **Continuous variables**: The continuous variables, including age, baseline ICH volume, baseline IVH volume, baseline Glasgow Coma Scale score, time from onset to initial CT, admission systolic BP, and admission diastolic BP, were compared using the Student t test or the Mann-Whitney U test.

- **Interobserver agreement**: Interobserver agreement on categorical variables was calculated using the Cohen κ interagreement test. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed by including all variables with P ≤ 0.1 in the univariate analysis. The level of significance was set to a P < 0.05.

The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

### Noncontrast computed tomography signs as predictors of hematoma expansion, clinical outcome, and response to tranexamic acid in acute intracerebral hemorrhage [^114JVeW2]. Stroke (2020). Low credibility.

One limitation of this study is the moderate interrater agreement (κ, 0.53–0.64). The raters came from a range of backgrounds, including physicians, radiographers, and medical students. Although all raters were trained before commencing assessment, the interpretation of the NCCT signs may not be as accurate as in other studies where assessments were usually performed by only two expert raters. Having more raters also reduced agreement, as it is less likely for four raters to completely agree on the presence of signs compared with two raters. However, our interpretation represents a real-world scenario where the raters are likely to have different backgrounds and experiences.

Recently, there is much enthusiasm for exploring the role of NCCT signs in predicting hematoma expansion. We found that previously established factors, such as baseline hematoma volume and onset-to-CT time, are more significant predictors of hematoma expansion. The addition of NCCT signs only improved the area under the curve minimally by 0.01 to 0.013. Hematoma volume may be the most important CT marker of hematoma expansion and may be used to better select participants in future hemostatic trials. Although we have used a semiautomated segmentation technique for volume measurement, a simple clinical tool such as the ABC/2 method has been shown previously to be reliable and feasible in the context of clinical trials. In view of its prognostic value, the calculation of hematoma volume should perhaps be recommended as routine clinical practice.

### Phantom-based standardization of CT angiography images for spot SIGN detection [^112RQQ3s]. Neuroradiology (2017). Low credibility.

The CT angiography (CTA) spot sign is a strong predictor of hematoma expansion in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, CTA parameters vary widely across centers and may negatively impact spot sign accuracy in predicting ICH expansion. We developed a CT iodine calibration phantom that was scanned at different institutions in a large multicenter ICH clinical trial to determine the effect of image standardization on spot sign detection and performance.

- **Methods**: A custom phantom containing known concentrations of iodine was designed and scanned using the stroke CT protocol at each institution. Custom software was developed to read the CT volume datasets and calculate the Hounsfield unit as a function of iodine concentration for each phantom scan. CTA images obtained within 8 hours from symptom onset were analyzed by two trained readers comparing the calibrated vs. uncalibrated density cutoffs for spot sign identification. ICH expansion was defined as hematoma volume growth greater than 33%.

- **Results**: A total of 90 subjects qualified for the study, of whom 17 out of 83 (20.5%) experienced ICH expansion. The number of spot sign-positive scans was higher in the calibrated analysis (67.8% vs 38.9%, p < 0.001). All spot signs identified in the non-calibrated analysis remained positive after calibration. Calibrated CTA images had higher sensitivity for ICH expansion (76% vs 52%) but inferior specificity (35% vs 63%) compared with uncalibrated images.

- **Conclusion**: Normalization of CTA images using phantom data is a feasible strategy to obtain consistent image quantification for spot sign analysis.

### Predictors and prognostic impact of hematoma expansion in infratentorial cerebral hemorrhage [^1132YdgW]. Neurocritical Care (2024). High credibility.

Hematoma expansion (HE) is common and predicts poor outcomes in patients with supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We investigated the predictors and prognostic impact of HE in infratentorial ICH.

- **Methods**: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with brainstem and cerebellar ICH admitted at seven sites. Noncontrast computed tomography images were analyzed for the presence of hypodensities according to validated criteria, defined as any hypodense region strictly encapsulated within the hemorrhage with any shape, size, and density. Occurrence of HE (defined as > 33% and/or > 6-mL growth) and mortality at 90 days were the outcomes of interest. Their predictors were investigated using logistic regression with backward elimination at p < 0.1. Logistic regression models for HE were adjusted for baseline ICH volume, antiplatelet and anticoagulant treatment, onset to computed tomography time, and presence of hypodensities. The logistic regression model for mortality accounted for the ICH score and HE.

- **Results**: A total of 175 patients were included (median age 75 years, 40.0% male), of whom 38 (21.7%) had HE and 43 (24.6%) died within 90 days. Study participants with HE had a higher frequency of hypodensities (44.7% vs. 24.1%, p = 0.013), presentation within 3 hours from onset (39.5% vs. 24.8%, p = 0.029), and 90-day mortality (44.7% vs. 19.0%, p = 0.001). Hypodensities remained independently associated with HE after adjustment for confounders (odds ratio 2.44, 95% confidence interval 1.13–5.25, p = 0.023). The association between HE and mortality remained significant in…

### Absolute risk and predictors of the growth of acute spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage: A systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data [^114YYrLD]. The Lancet Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

The strengths of this study include its large sample size and the availability of many predictors from geographically diverse cohorts. This allowed the development and external validation of prediction models involving simple predictors that could be utilized in any healthcare setting, alongside the added value of CT angiography in high-income countries. We minimized the risk of selection and information biases by restricting eligibility to cohorts that defined when they would repeat brain imaging soon after intracerebral haemorrhage onset in all survivors, rather than based on clinical need alone.

Although our study was large, only half of the investigators from the available cohorts contributed patient-level data. Most cohorts were assembled in high-income countries. A shortage of data on the following variables precluded their inclusion in our prediction models: previous intracerebral haemorrhage, previous ischemic stroke, history of liver disease, history of excessive alcohol consumption, platelet count at presentation, and NIHSS score at presentation. Since concluding the literature search that defined inclusion in our analyses, an update of the search to March 1, 2018, identified reports of five new cohorts involving 669 patients. This represents a maximum of a 10% increase over the 6,428 patients from 36 cohorts that provided individual patient data. Nonetheless, the achieved sample size allowed for the development and validation of prediction models using a large number of widely available predictors, ensuring none identified by previous prediction models were omitted.

### Redefining hematoma expansion with the inclusion of intraventricular hemorrhage growth [^114v9tyC]. Stroke (2020). Low credibility.

The study aimed to redefine significant hematoma expansion by incorporating intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) growth. Traditionally, definitions focus solely on intraparenchymal volume changes. However, IVH presence is a predictor of poor outcomes, though it is not included in current expansion definitions. This study evaluated whether including IVH expansion predicts 90-day outcomes more effectively.

Using data from the PREDICT-ICH study (Predicting Hematoma Growth and Outcome in Intracerebral Hemorrhage Using Contrast Bolus CT), researchers compared a standard definition of hematoma expansion (≥ 6 mL or ≥ 33%) with revised definitions incorporating new IVH development or expansion (≥ 6 mL or ≥ 33% or any IVH; ≥ 6 mL or ≥ 33% or IVH expansion ≥ 1 mL). The primary outcome assessed was poor clinical outcome, quantified by a modified Rankin Scale score of 4 to 6 at 90 days. Diagnostic accuracy measures were calculated for each definition, and C statistics were compared using nonparametric methods.

Of the 256 patients eligible for primary analysis, 127 (49.6%) had a modified Rankin Scale score of 4 to 6. Sensitivity and specificity for the standard definition (n = 80) were 45.7% (95% CI, 36.8–54.7) and 82.9% (95% CI, 75.3–88.9), respectively. The revised definition, ≥ 6 mL or ≥ 33% or any IVH (n = 113), showed improved sensitivity of 63.8% (95% CI, 54.8–72.1) and specificity of 75.2% (95% CI, 66.8–82.4). Overall accuracy improved significantly with the revised definition (P = 0.013), and after adjusting for relevant covariates, it was associated with a 2.55-fold increased odds of predicting poor outcome.

### The CT swirl SIGN is associated with hematoma expansion in intracerebral hemorrhage [^114ma98p]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2018). Low credibility.

Hematoma expansion is an independent determinant of poor clinical outcome in intracerebral hemorrhage. Although the "spot sign" predicts hematoma expansion, the identification requires CT angiography, which limits its general accessibility in some hospital settings. Noncontrast CT, without the need for CT angiography, may identify sites of active extravasation, termed the "swirl sign". We aimed to determine the association of the swirl sign with hematoma expansion.

- **Materials and methods**: Patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage between 2007 and 2014 who underwent an initial and subsequent noncontrast CT at a single center were retrospectively identified. The swirl sign, on noncontrast CT, was defined as iso- or hypodensity within a hyperdense region that extended across two contiguous 5-mm axial CT sections.

- **Results**: A total of 212 patients met the inclusion criteria. The swirl sign was identified in 91 patients with excellent interobserver agreement (κ = 0.87). The swirl sign was associated with larger initial hematoma (P < .001), earlier initial CT (P < .001), and hematoma expansion (P = 0.028). Multivariable regression modeling demonstrated that if one assumed similar initial hematoma volume, onset-to-first scan, and time between CT scans, the median absolute hematoma growth was 5.77 mL (95% CI, 2.37–9.18 mL; p = 0.001) and relative growth was 35.6% (95% CI, 18.5%-52.6%; P < .001) higher in patients with the swirl sign compared to those without.

- **Conclusions**: The NCCT swirl sign was reliably identified and is associated with hematoma expansion.

### Contrast extravasation on CT angiography predicts hematoma expansion in intracerebral hemorrhage [^115XsSDB]. Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) presenting within 3 hours of symptom onset are known to be at increased risk of expansion. However, only a minority arrive within this time frame, and therefore, alternative markers for expansion risk are needed.

- **Objective**: To examine whether contrast extravasation on CT angiography (CTA) at presentation predicts subsequent hematoma expansion.

- **Methods**: Consecutive patients with primary ICH presenting to an urban tertiary care hospital were prospectively captured in a database. We retrospectively reviewed images for all patients receiving a CTA and at least one further CT scan within 48 hours.

- **Results**: Complete data were available for 104 patients. Contrast extravasation at the time of CTA was present in 56% of patients and was associated with an increased risk of hematoma expansion (22% vs. 2%, p = 0.003). Patients who received a baseline CTA within 3 hours were more likely to have subsequent expansion (27% vs. 13% for those presenting later, p = 0.1). However, after multivariable analysis, contrast extravasation was the only significant predictor of hematoma expansion (OR 18, 95% CI 2.1 to 162). This effect was independent of time to presentation.

- **Conclusions**: Contrast extravasation is independently associated with hematoma expansion. Patients presenting within the first few hours after symptom onset have traditionally been considered those at highest risk of expansion. However, for those presenting later, the presence of contrast may be a useful marker to guide therapies aimed at decreasing this risk.

### Spot SIGN in intracerebral hemorrhage: Critical reappraisal and future clinical implications [^111ifAjA]. Stroke (2025). High credibility.

Hematoma expansion (HE) is a common occurrence affecting around 10% to 30% of patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage within the initial hours from symptom onset and is the only modifiable factor associated with poor clinical outcomes. The detection of contrast extravasation on computed tomography (CT) angiography, known as the spot sign, was initially embraced as a promising radiological marker for predicting HE that could aid patient selection for acute interventions aimed at minimizing HE. However, the initial enthusiasm waned as clinical studies failed to show clear clinical benefits of hemostatic treatments when patients were selected based on the presence of this imaging marker.

In this narrative review, we provide a comprehensive summary of the pathophysiology, definitions, imaging protocols, and predictive performance of the spot sign, along with the clinical studies that have selected and treated patients based on its presence. Finally, we delve into some nuances of the spot sign that can enhance its predictive performance and help stratify HE risk with greater precision. These features include static findings observed on single-phase CT angiography (i.e. number, volume, CT density, and colocalization with hypodensities), as well as dynamic findings identified on multiphase/dynamic CT angiography (i.e. timing of appearance, volume increase, volume decrease for tissue dispersion, and CT density changes). In this reappraisal of the spot sign, we aim to reinvigorate research on advanced neuroimaging in intracerebral hemorrhage that could lead to more accurate HE predictions.

### Noncontrast computed tomography signs as predictors of hematoma expansion, clinical outcome, and response to tranexamic acid in acute intracerebral hemorrhage [^116XNXiA]. Stroke (2020). Low credibility.

Hypodensities have been found to be useful predictors of hematoma expansion and poor functional outcomes. There is significant overlap between the black hole sign and hypodensities, where the black hole sign is a subset of hypodensities. We found hypodensities to be more sensitive but less specific than the black hole sign, with the adjusted odds ratio (aOR) in predicting hematoma expansion for hypodensities being similar to that for the black hole sign (aOR: 2.06 versus 2.01).

On the contrary, the island sign did not emerge as an independent predictor of hematoma expansion. The island sign was of particular interest as it was reported to be very specific but less sensitive than other noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) signs. The island sign was first reported as a predictor of hematoma expansion and poor functional outcome in a single-center study by Li et al. Similarly, we found the island sign to have high specificity but low sensitivity in detecting hematoma expansion. However, after accounting for hematoma volume, the island sign did not independently predict hematoma expansion. This lack of independence may be due to the fact that the island sign was mostly present in large hematomas (64.6 mL in island sign-positive cases versus 11.8 mL in island sign-negative cases). Hence, hematoma volume was a significant confounder. Comparatively, the median volume was 30 mL in island sign-positive hematomas in the study by Li et al. Another reason may be the relatively low prevalence of the island sign in our cohort (8.8%) compared to 16% in the study by Li et al, indicating that our numbers may be inadequately powered to detect a difference.

### Advances in computed tomography-based prognostic methods for intracerebral hemorrhage [^113aii7N]. Neurosurgical Review (2022). High credibility.

Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) has high morbidity and mortality. Computed tomography (CT) plays an important role in the diagnosis, treatment, and research of cerebrovascular diseases. Non-contrast CT is widely used in the clinical diagnosis of ICH because of its high imaging speed and its high sensitivity and specificity in the detection of stroke. Many CT imaging markers, quantitative parameters, and artificial intelligence (AI) methods based on CT are increasingly used for the prediction of hematoma expansion (HE), prognosis of ICH, and the evaluation of perihematomal edema (PHE). Therefore, we performed a comprehensive review of studies focusing on research evidence related to CT use for the prediction of HE and prognosis. This review discusses recent insights, outlines limitations, and puts forward suggestions for addressing challenges and directions for future research. Although at present the prognosis for ICH is not optimistic, the treatment methods remain controversial. However, identifying imaging markers that can evaluate and predict existing or potential therapeutic targets could help provide individualized advice for patients and achieve patient risk stratification, which is a key step in improving treatment outcomes.

### Independent validation of the hematoma expansion prediction score: A non-contrast score equivalent in accuracy to the spot SIGN [^113mtxvz]. Neurocritical Care (2019). Low credibility.

The computed tomography angiography (CTA) spot sign is widely used to assess the risk of hematoma expansion following acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). However, not all patients can receive intravenous contrast, nor are all hospital systems equipped with this technology. We aimed to independently validate the Hematoma Expansion Prediction (HEP) Score, an 18-point non-contrast prediction scale, in an external cohort and compare its diagnostic capability to the CTA spot sign.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective analysis of the Predicting Hematoma Growth and Outcome in Intracerebral Hemorrhage Using Contrast Bolus CT (PREDICT) Cohort Study. The primary outcome was significant hematoma expansion (≥ 6 mL or ≥ 33%). We generated a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve comparing the HEP score to significant expansion. We calculated sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV/NPV) for each score point. We determined independent predictors of significant hematoma expansion via logistic regression.

- **Results**: A total of 292 patients were included in the primary analysis. Hematoma growth of ≥ 6 mL or ≥ 33% occurred in 94 patients (32%). The HEP score was associated with significant expansion (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01–1.30). ROC curves comparing HEP score to significant expansion had an area under the curve of 0.64 (95% CI 0.57–0.71). Youden's method showed an optimum score of 4. HEP Scores ≥ 4 (n = 100, sensitivity 49%, specificity 73%, PPV 46%, NPV 75%, aOR 1.99, 95% CI 1.09–3.64) accurately predicted significant hematoma expansion.

### Benign intracerebral hemorrhage: A population at low risk for hematoma growth and poor outcome [^111bQ63v]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The data supporting the findings of this study are available from the corresponding authors upon reasonable request.

We prospectively included patients presenting with acute primary intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) to our hospital between July 2011 and February 2017. Patients were included in our analysis if they met the following criteria: (1) a baseline CT scan within six hours after the onset of symptoms and (2) a follow-up CT scan within 36 hours after the initial CT scan. Patients were excluded if they had primary intraventricular hemorrhage, anticoagulant-associated bleeding, secondary ICH attributable to arteriovenous malformation or intracranial aneurysm, surgery before the follow-up CT, or if they were lost to follow-up at three months.

Trained neurologists obtained and recorded baseline demographic and clinical data, which included age, sex, medical history, and medication use history. Other data captured included admission blood pressure, ICH score, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, premorbid modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, the time from symptom onset to baseline CT scanning, and the time interval between baseline CT and follow-up CT scanning. The study investigators provided free medical consultation during the study period for patients willing to participate in our study. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the mRS score through a telephone interview by trained medical staff at the three-month follow-up. A good outcome was defined as a three-month mRS score…

### Prediction of haematoma growth and outcome in patients with intracerebral haemorrhage using the CT-angiography spot SIGN (PREDICT): a prospective observational study [^111XkGcT]. The Lancet Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

In patients with intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH), early haemorrhage expansion affects clinical outcomes. Haemostatic treatment reduces haematoma expansion but fails to improve clinical outcomes in many patients. Proper selection of patients at high risk for haematoma expansion seems crucial to improve outcomes. In this study, we aimed to prospectively validate the CT-angiography (CTA) spot sign for the prediction of haematoma expansion.

- **Methods**: PREDICT (predicting haematoma growth and outcome in intracerebral haemorrhage using contrast bolus CT) was a multicentre prospective observational cohort study. We recruited patients aged 18 years or older with ICH smaller than 100 mL, presenting at less than 6 hours from symptom onset. Using two independent core laboratories, one neuroradiologist determined CTA spot-sign status, whereas another neurologist, masked for clinical outcomes and imaging, measured haematoma volumes by computerized planimetry. The primary outcome was haematoma expansion, defined as absolute growth greater than 6 mL or a relative growth of more than 33% from initial CT to follow-up CT. We reported data using standard descriptive statistics stratified by the CTA spot sign. Mortality was assessed with Kaplan-Meier survival analysis.

- **Findings**: We enrolled 268 patients. The median time from symptom onset to baseline CT was 135 minutes (range 22–470), and time from onset to CTA was 159 minutes (32–475). Eighty-one (30%) patients were spot-sign positive. The primary analysis included 228 patients, who had a follow-up CT before surgery or death. Median baseline ICH volume was…

### Combination of intra-hematomal hypodensity on CT and BRAIN scoring improves prediction of hemorrhage expansion in ICH [^116nurzT]. Neurocritical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Hematoma expansion (HE) occurs in one-third of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients and is associated with poor outcomes. Intra-hematomal hypodensity (IHH) on CT has been reported to predict HE, as has the "BRAIN" score. We sought to assess the predictive value of these markers both alone and in combination.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective single-center study of ICH patients with CT hemoglobin levels of ≤ 6 mL and > 6 mL or > 33%. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the relationship between IHH and HE. The predictive value of the BRAIN score alone and when integrated with IHH was assessed.

- **Results**: In 122 included patients, the median ICH volume was 13 ml, and the median time to CT was 2.0 hours; HE of > 6 mL occurred in 31%, and > 6 ml/ > 33% occurred in 43% of subjects. IHH was identified in 61% of patients, with moderate inter-rater agreement (κ = 0.59). In multivariable analysis, IHH was associated with HE using the > 6 mL definition (OR 8.3, 95% CI, 2.6–32.8, P = 0.005) but not with > 6 ml/ > 33% definition (OR 1.9, 95% CI 0.84–4.3, P = 0.12). The rate of HE (> 6 ml) increased across ascending BRAIN score quartiles (Q1: 11%, Q2: 23%, Q3: 43%, Q4: 57%, P for trend < 0.001). The proportion of patients experiencing HE > 6 mL with a BRAIN score ≥ 10 and IHH was 55%, with either alone it was 33%, and with neither it was 3%.

- **Conclusions**: Combining IHH on non-contrast CT with a simple clinical BRAIN score is a potentially powerful method to predict those patients at very high and very low risk of HE.

### Noncontrast computed tomography signs as predictors of hematoma expansion, clinical outcome, and response to tranexamic acid in acute intracerebral hemorrhage [^11726onQ]. Stroke (2020). Low credibility.

Black hole sign, hypodensities, and island sign independently predicted poor functional outcome, although the island sign did not predict hematoma expansion. Conversely, the blend sign, which independently predicted hematoma expansion, did not predict poor functional outcome. This suggests that although hematoma expansion increased the risk of poor functional outcomes, other factors contributed to poor functional outcomes. This finding is in keeping with the trial's main results, where tranexamic acid significantly reduced hematoma expansion, early death (< 7 days), and serious adverse events but did not improve functional outcomes at day 90. We hypothesize that one of the mechanisms may be the development of perihematomal edema. Hematomas with the island sign have a larger surface area of contact with the surrounding tissue, which may contribute to more inflammation and cerebral edema.

While some of the NCCT signs are useful predictors of hematoma expansion, none of the signs reliably predicted the clinical benefit of tranexamic acid. This again supports the hypothesis of an alternate pathological process contributing to poor outcomes. Although tranexamic acid reduced the risk of hematoma expansion, its effect is short-lasting, with a half-life of 3 hours. It is therefore unlikely that tranexamic acid will have any biological effect on events occurring later, such as perihematomal edema. In addition, the number of patients with NCCT signs is relatively small and may be inadequately powered to detect a modest benefit of tranexamic acid.

### Leakage SIGN for primary intracerebral hemorrhage: A novel predictor of hematoma growth [^111G7zUh]. Stroke (2016). Low credibility.

The findings of this study indicate that the leakage sign is useful for predicting the growth of a primary intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). It offers good reproducibility, a clear definition, and the convenience of needing only a 5-minute waiting period. It employs a restrictive region of interest (ROI) with a 1-cm diameter and detects a 10% increase in Hounsfield Units (HU). Furthermore, the sensitivity (93.3%; 95% confidence interval, 0.757–0.988) and specificity (88.8%; 95% confidence interval, 0.815–0.912) for hematoma expansion were high. The leakage sign can also predict poor outcomes for all patients with a primary ICH and specifically those with an ICH in the putamen.

The spot sign is currently considered a useful radiological indicator on computed tomography angiography (CTA), revealing extravasation of contrast media or a bleeding artery in a hematoma, and serves as a prognostic predictor. However, the spot sign reportedly indicates both active bleeding and a striate artery.

- **Modified spot sign**: A modified spot sign has recently been described, in which delayed-phase CT is performed 2 to 5 minutes after the initial CT. The sensitivity and specificity were reportedly higher with delayed-phase CT evaluation. However, these studies did not report the specific timing of the second CT or define a positive finding.

In the present study, we aimed to identify more subtle extravasation than what could be accomplished using the spot sign. This led to waiting 5 minutes after the CTA for the delayed-phase CT. We defined a positive finding as a 1-cm diameter ROI and a > 10% increase in HU in the ROI. This method is easy to perform and can be completed in all institutes with necessary equipment.

### Minimal computed tomography attenuation value within the hematoma is associated with hematoma expansion and poor outcome in intracerebral hemorrhage patients [^116jqNKF]. Neurocritical Care (2019). Low credibility.

Early hematoma expansion in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) patients is associated with poor outcomes. This study aimed to investigate whether the minimal computed tomography (CT) attenuation value could predict hematoma expansion and poor outcomes.

- **Methods**: This study involved spontaneous ICH patients from two cohorts who underwent a baseline CT scan within 6 hours after ICH onset, followed by a CT scan within 24 hours. A retrospective analysis of a derivation cohort was conducted to determine the critical value of the minimal CT attenuation value. Subsequently, a prospective study in a validation cohort across three clinical centers was performed to establish the association between the minimal CT attenuation value and hematoma expansion, as well as poor outcomes (modified Rankin Scale scores > 3) at 90 days, using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses.

- **Results**: A total of 148 ICH patients were included in the derivation cohort. A minimal CT attenuation value of ≤ 31 Hounsfield units (HU) was identified as the critical value for predicting hematoma expansion using receiver operating characteristic analysis. The validation cohort included 311 ICH patients, of which 86 (27.7%) exhibited hematoma expansion and 133 (42.8%) experienced poor outcomes. A minimal CT attenuation value of ≤ 31 HU was positive in 73 patients (23.5%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that both the minimal CT attenuation value and the threshold of ≤ 31 HU independently predicted hematoma expansion (p < 0.001) and poor outcomes (p < 0.001).

### Assessing the use of contrast CT in intracerebral hemorrhage [^111FogLm]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2025). High credibility.

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is the deadliest stroke subtype and currently has no disease-specific treatment. As bleeding continues early in the course of ICH, early hemostatic therapy may be an effective treatment option. However, reliable predictors for ICH expansion are crucial for guiding intervention. One potential predictor is the "spot sign" test, identified through computed tomography angiography (CTA) as small, enhancing foci of bleeding. This test has shown promise in predicting hematoma expansion; however, recent clinical trials have failed to confirm its predictive value. It is essential to evaluate the spot sign's utility in clinical practice and assess the safety of CTA imaging in ICH patients. This may help create accurate models for determining the effectiveness of ultra-early hemostatic interventions and ensure diagnostic safety.

In this article, we review the literature on hemostatic and thrombotic processes following the infusion of iodinated contrast media during CTA testing. Understanding these processes may help evaluate the utility of contrast CT in the diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage.

### CT radiomics combined with clinical and radiological factors predict hematoma expansion in hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage [^114VwT51]. European Radiology (2025). High credibility.

This study aimed to establish a hematoma expansion (HE) prediction model for hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage (HICH) patients by combining CT radiomics, clinical information, and conventional imaging signs.

- **Methods**: A retrospective continuous collection of HICH patients from three medical centers was divided into a training set (n = 555), a validation set (n = 239), and a test set (n = 77). Radiomics features were extracted from baseline CT plain scan images and combined with clinical information and conventional imaging signs to construct radiomics models, clinical imaging sign models, and hybrid models. The models were evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC), clinical decision curve analysis (DCA), net reclassification index (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI).

- **Results**: In the training, validation, and testing sets, the radiomics model predicted an AUC of HE of 0.885, 0.827, and 0.894, respectively, while the clinical imaging sign model predicted an AUC of HE of 0.759, 0.725, and 0.765, respectively. Glasgow coma scale score at admission, first CT hematoma volume, irregular hematoma shape, and radiomics score were used to construct a hybrid model, with AUCs of 0.901, 0.838, and 0.917, respectively. The DCA shows that the hybrid model had the highest net profit rate. Compared with the radiomics model and the clinical imaging sign model, the hybrid model showed an increase in NRI and IDI.

The hybrid model based on CT radiomics combined with clinical and radiological factors can effectively individualize the prediction of hematoma expansion in patients with hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage.

### Quantitative CT radiomics-based models for prediction of haematoma expansion and poor functional outcome in primary intracerebral haemorrhage [^114a964M]. European Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

A recent meta-analysis found that several factors are significant for predicting haematoma expansion (HE) in the context of primary intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). These factors include time from symptom onset to baseline CT imaging, baseline intracerebral haemorrhage volume, antiplatelet use, and anticoagulant use. Despite their importance, these clinical factors may not encompass the full spectrum of predictive information available from patients. Hence, an approach that automatically extracts features from images may provide valuable complementary information for prediction.

Radiomics is a relatively recent quantitative approach that involves extracting a large number of features — such as intensity statistics, shape descriptors, or texture measurements — from radiological images. These features are then tested as outcome predictors. We hypothesize that radiomics-based features predict haematoma expansion and poor functional outcomes, as they may capture characteristics of the haematoma linked to instability, such as heterogeneity or complex shape, as well as subtle characteristics not readily appreciable to the naked eye.

Recent studies have applied this radiomics-based approach to predict HE; however, these studies have been relatively small, with the largest including just over 250 subjects, and were based on either a single centre or just four centres. While useful for demonstrating the feasibility of the approach, the generalisability of the results remains unclear. In this paper, we investigate the use of non-contrast CT (NCCT) radiomics-based features and generalised linear models for predicting both HE and poor functional outcomes.

### Contrast extravasation on computed tomography angiography predicts clinical outcome in primary intracerebral hemorrhage: a prospective study of 139 cases [^114Ea44B]. Stroke (2011). Low credibility.

Several retrospective studies have suggested that contrast extravasation on CT angiography predicts hematoma expansion, poor outcome, and mortality in primary intracerebral hemorrhage. This study aimed to determine the predictive value of contrast extravasation on multidetector CT angiography for clinical outcomes in a prospective setting.

In this study, 160 consecutive patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, admitted within 6 hours of symptom onset, underwent noncontrast CT and multidetector CT angiography upon admission. A follow-up noncontrast CT was performed at 24 hours. The multidetector CT angiography images were analyzed to identify the presence of contrast extravasation. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the modified Rankin Scale at discharge and at 90 days.

The final analysis included 139 patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage. Contrast extravasation was observed in 30 (21.6%) patients, and its presence was associated with increased hematoma expansion (P < 0.0001), in-hospital mortality (P = 0.008), prolonged hospital stay (P = 0.006), poor outcome on discharge (P = 0.025), increased 3-month mortality (P = 0.009), and poor clinical outcome (P < 0.0001). In multivariate analysis, contrast extravasation emerged as a promising independent predictor (OR, 10.5; 95% CI, 3.2–34.7; P < 0.0001) for 90-day poor clinical outcome, followed by the presence of intraventricular hemorrhage (OR, 3.4; 95% CI, 1.5–7.7; P = 0.003) and initial hematoma volume (OR, 1.0; 95% CI, 1.0–1.1; P = 0.013).

The presence of contrast extravasation on CT angiography is a significant independent predictor of adverse clinical outcomes in patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage.

### Leakage SIGN for primary intracerebral hemorrhage: A novel predictor of hematoma growth [^114VQbNN]. Stroke (2016). Low credibility.

In the present study, all patients were able to wait 5 minutes as they were without respiratory or cardiac problems. Due to the high specificity and sensitivity for hematoma expansion demonstrated, we suggest that 5 minutes is an appropriate duration before performing a second CT scan.

Another potential issue is the increased radiation exposure with this method, as it requires an additional CT scan compared to the conventional method. However, if hematoma growth can be detected, the clinical benefits outweigh the risks of additional radiation, and unnecessary segmental scans during hospitalization could be avoided.

The effectiveness of surgical removal of a spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) remains controversial, and the indication for surgery becomes more limited as time passes. In emergency care, determining the need for emergency surgery for cerebral hemorrhage can be challenging. For patients not indicated for surgery, preventing hematoma expansion is crucial. Although aggressive therapies to reduce blood pressure and initiate active craniotomy are controversial, they might be useful for high-risk patients with a positive leakage sign, as hematoma expansion is a significant factor for a poor outcome. Therefore, we believe that the leakage sign is superior to the spot sign for predicting hematoma growth within several hours in patients with a critical hematoma size. Based on a previous review of studies regarding predictive methods for hematoma expansion using CTA and delayed CTA, including the spot sign and modified approaches, this method shows promise.

### Noncontrast computed tomography markers as predictors of revised hematoma expansion in acute intracerebral hemorrhage [^115CYhXb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Low credibility.

We reported that NCCT markers are closely associated with IVH growth and RHE. Moreover, expansion-prone hematoma showed higher predictive accuracy for the prediction of RHE and poor outcomes than any single NCCT marker. These findings may assist in the risk stratification of active bleeding and clinical decision-making in patients with acute ICH.

### New and expanding ventricular hemorrhage predicts poor outcome in acute intracerebral hemorrhage [^113ibNeB]. Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

To describe the relationship between intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) expansion and long-term outcome, we investigated clinically relevant thresholds of IVH expansion in two separate intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) populations.

We used fractional polynomial analysis to test linear and nonlinear models of the 24-hour IVH volume change and clinical outcome using data from the Predicting Hematoma Growth and Outcome in Intracerebral Hemorrhage Using Contrast Bolus CT (PREDICT)-ICH study. The primary outcome was a poor clinical outcome, defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 4–6 at 90 days. Dichotomous thresholds were derived from the selected model, and diagnostic accuracy measures were calculated. All thresholds were validated in an independent single-center ICH cohort at Massachusetts General Hospital.

Of the 256 patients from PREDICT, 127 (49.6%) had an mRS score of 4 to 6. A nonlinear relationship was observed between the 24-hour IVH volume change and poor outcome, with minimal increases in IVH associated with a high probability of an mRS score of 4 to 6. Specifically, IVH expansion of ≥ 1 mL (n = 53; sensitivity 33%, specificity 92%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11–6.46) and the development of any new IVH (n = 74; sensitivity 43%, specificity 85%; aOR 2.53, 95% CI 1.22–5.26) strongly predicted poor outcome at 90 days. These dichotomous thresholds were well reproduced in a validation cohort of 169 patients.

IVH expansion as small as 1 mL or any new IVH is strongly predictive of a poor outcome, potentially aiding in clinical decision-making for patients with acute ICH.

### Venous phase of computed tomography angiography increases spot SIGN detection, but intracerebral hemorrhage expansion is greater in spot signs detected in arterial phase [^113mbW53]. Stroke (2014). Low credibility.

Variability in computed tomography angiography (CTA) acquisitions may be one explanation for the modest accuracy of the spot sign for predicting intracerebral hemorrhage expansion detected in the multicenter Predicting Hematoma Growth and Outcome in Intracerebral Hemorrhage Using Contrast Bolus CT (PREDICT) study. This study aimed to determine the frequency of the spot sign in intracerebral hemorrhage and its relationship with hematoma expansion depending on the phase of image acquisition.

- **Methods**: PREDICT study was a prospective observational cohort study of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage presenting within 6 hours from onset. A post hoc analysis of the Hounsfield units of an artery and venous structure were measured on CTA source images of the entire PREDICT cohort in a core laboratory. Each CTA study was classified into arterial or venous phase and into 1 of 5 specific image acquisition phases. Significant hematoma expansion and total hematoma enlargement were recorded at 24 hours.

- **Results**: Overall (n = 371), 77.9% of CTA were acquired in arterial phase. The spot sign, present in 29.9% of patients, was more frequently seen in venous phase as compared with arterial phase (39% versus 27.3%; P = 0.041) and the later the phase of image acquisition (P = 0.095). Significant hematoma expansion (P = 0.253) and higher total hematoma enlargement (P = 0.019) were observed more frequently among spot sign-positive patients with earlier phases of image acquisition.

- **Conclusions**: Later image acquisition of CTA improves the frequency of spot sign detection. However, intracerebral hemorrhage expansion is more significant in spot signs detected in the arterial phase.

### Non-contrast computed tomography features predict intraventricular hemorrhage growth [^116rTPnp]. European Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

More than 5.5 million patients suffer from intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) annually, and ICH represents the most severe form of stroke, with mortality and severe disability rates approaching 50% at one month and exceeding 75% at one year. Therapeutic strategies have failed to show overall beneficial treatment effects in previous ICH trials over the past years. Therefore, new candidates for potential treatment strategies are attracting significant research attention. Intraventricular extension of intracerebral hemorrhage (IVH) occurs in 40% of ICH patients and is a well-established predictor of poor functional outcome. IVH is a dynamic and potentially modifiable process (IVH growth) which can present either as interval increases in IVH volume (expansion IVH, eIVH) or as a delayed development of IVH (dIVH) on subsequent neuroimaging. Furthermore, both have shown a strong relationship with poor functional outcomes and hold potential to improve outcome prediction models for clinical ICH management.

Recent evidence suggested that non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) features might help identify patients at risk of IVH growth; however, the exact relationship with eIVH and dIVH remains unclear. Therefore, we hypothesized that both subgroups are independently predicted by distinct NCCT features. Recognizing that eIVH and dIVH vary in terms of chronological order and ICH location, and are common phenomena in patients with acute hemorrhagic events, we additionally hypothesized a potential link with the effects exerted by the NCCT features.

### Prevalence and diagnostic performance of computed tomography angiography spot SIGN for intracerebral hematoma expansion depend on scan timing [^114ZrfPM]. Neuroradiology (2014). Low credibility.

The computed tomography angiography (CTA) spot sign correlates with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) expansion; however, various diagnostic performances for hematoma expansion, especially in sensitivity, have been reported. We aimed to assess the impact of scan timing of CTA on the diagnostic performance of the CTA spot sign for ICH expansion in two different arterial phases within patients.

- **Methods**: Eighty-three consecutive patients with primary ICH who received two sequential CTAs were recruited. Two neuroradiologists reviewed CTAs for CTA spot signs, while one reviewed initial and follow-up non-contrast CT for measuring ICH volume. The time interval between two phases was then calculated, and the diagnostic performance of CTA spot sign in each phase was evaluated.

- **Results**: CTA spot signs were observed in 20/83 (24.1%) patients in the early phase and 44/83 (53.0%) patients in the late phase. The mean time interval between the two phases was 12.7 seconds. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy for hematoma progression of CTA spot sign were 48.1%, 87.5%, 65.0%, 77.8%, and 74.7%, respectively, in the early phase; and 92.6%, 66.1%, 56.8%, 94.9%, and 74.7%, respectively, in the late phase. The CTA spot sign was significantly associated with ICH expansion in early (P < 0.001) and late (P < 0.00001) phases (Pearson's chi-square test).

- **Conclusion**: A mere 10-second difference in scan timing could affect the prevalence and diagnostic performance of the CTA spot sign, suggesting a need for the standardization of the CTA protocol.

### Predicting hematoma expansion in acute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: integrating clinical factors with a multitask deep learning model for non-contrast head CT [^116iohU9]. Neuroradiology (2024). Low credibility.

For the hematoma slice classification model, a pre-trained "SEResNeXt-50" architecture was designed to distinguish hematoma slices from a patient's non-contrast head CT images. This architecture, enriched with attention mechanisms, is an enhanced variant of ResNeXt-50. It is based on VGG and ResNets architectures and combines repetitive layering with a split-transform-merge strategy for deep feature learning in image classification. The model integrates Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks to emphasize crucial features in convolutional layers, significantly improving image classification performance. Implemented using PyTorch, it utilizes a learning rate of 1e-4, a weight decay of 1e-6, and a batch size of 8. This fine-tuned model accepts 2D CT images of size 512 × 512 as input and determines the presence or absence of a hematoma.

- **Workflow of hematoma expansion prediction model**: This multi-task deep learning approach for hematoma expansion prediction in non-contrast head CT images encompasses slice classification, segmentation, and expansion prediction of hematoma. The classification phase utilizes the SEResNeXt-50 model, enhanced with attention mechanisms, to distinguish normal from hematoma-containing slices.

- **Segmentation phase**: Utilizing the U-Net model facilitates feature extraction associated with hematomas and employs the size of the segmented hematoma regions as a weighting factor in subsequent prediction models.

### Predictors of severe intracerebral hemorrhage expansion [^116ti6Yv]. European Stroke Journal (2024). High credibility.

Severe hematoma expansion (sHE) has the strongest impact on intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) outcomes. This study investigated the predictors of sHE.

- **Methods**: Retrospective analysis of ICH patients was conducted across nine sites in Italy, Germany, China, and Canada. The following imaging features were analyzed: non-contrast CT (NCCT) hypodensities, heterogeneous density, blend sign, irregular shape, and CT angiography (CTA) spot sign. The outcome of interest was sHE, defined as a volume increase of > 66% and/or > 12.5 mL from baseline to follow-up NCCT. Predictors of sHE were explored with logistic regression.

- **Results**: A total of 1472 patients were included (median age 73, 56.6% males), of whom 223 (15.2%) had sHE. Age (odds ratio (OR) per year, 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02 (1.01–1.04)), anticoagulant treatment (OR 3.00, 95% CI 2.09–4.31), Glasgow Coma Scale (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89–0.98), time from onset/last known well to imaging (OR per hour 0.96, 95% CI 0.93–0.99), and baseline ICH volume (OR per mL 1.02, 95% CI 1.02–1.03) were independently associated with sHE. Ultra-early hematoma growth (baseline volume/baseline imaging time) was also a predictor of sHE (OR per mL/hour 1.01, 95% CI 1.00–1.02). All NCCT and CTA imaging markers were predictors of sHE. Among the imaging features, NCCT hypodensities had the highest sensitivity (0.79), whereas the CTA spot sign had the highest positive predictive value (0.51).

- **Conclusions**: sHE is common in the natural history of ICH and can be predicted with a few clinical and imaging variables. These findings might inform clinical practice and future trials.

### Black hole SIGN: Novel imaging marker that predicts hematoma growth in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage [^115vsSQa]. Stroke (2016). High credibility.

Early hematoma growth is a devastating neurological complication after intracerebral hemorrhage. We aim to report and evaluate the usefulness of computed tomography (CT) black hole sign in predicting hematoma growth in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage.

- **Methods**: Patients with intracerebral hemorrhage were screened for the presence of CT black hole sign on admission head CT performed within 6 hours after onset of symptoms. The black hole sign was defined as a hypoattenuating area encapsulated within the hyperattenuating hematoma with a clearly defined border. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of CT black hole sign in predicting hematoma expansion were calculated. Logistic regression analyses were used to assess the presence of the black hole sign and early hematoma growth.

- **Results**: A total of 206 patients were enrolled. The black hole sign was found in 30 (14.6%) of 206 patients on the baseline CT scan. The black hole sign was more common in patients with hematoma growth (31.9%) than those without hematoma growth (5.8%; P < 0.001). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of black hole sign in predicting early hematoma growth were 31.9%, 94.1%, 73.3%, and 73.2%, respectively. The time-to-admission CT scan, baseline hematoma volume, and the presence of black hole sign on admission CT independently predict hematoma growth in a multivariate model.

- **Conclusions**: The CT black hole sign could be used as a simple and easy-to-use predictor for early hematoma growth in patients.

### Integration of computed tomographic angiography spot SIGN and noncontrast computed tomographic hypodensities to predict hematoma expansion [^112USuii]. Stroke (2018). Low credibility.

Noncontrast computed tomographic (CT) hypodensities represent an alternative to the CT angiography spot sign (SS) to predict intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) expansion. However, previous studies suggested that these markers predicted hematoma expansion independently from each other. We investigated whether the integration of SS and hypodensity (HD) improved the stratification of ICH expansion risk.

- **Methods**: A single-center cohort of consecutive patients with ICH was retrospectively analyzed. Patients with available CT angiography, baseline, and follow-up noncontrast CT images were included. Trained readers reviewed all the images for SS and HD presence, and the study population was classified into four groups: SS and HD negative (SS-HD-), SS positive only (SS+HD-), HD positive only (SS-HD+), and SS and HD positive (SS+HD+). ICH expansion was defined as hematoma growth > 33% or > 6 mL. The association between SS and HD presence and ICH expansion was investigated with multivariable logistic regression.

- **Results**: A total of 745 subjects qualified for the analysis (median age, 73 years; 54.1% men). The rates of ICH expansion were 9.3% in SS-HD-, 25.8% in SS+HD-, 27.4% in SS-HD+, and 55.6% in SS+HD+ patients (P < 0.001). After adjustment for potential confounders and keeping SS-HD- subjects as reference, the risk of ICH expansion was increased in SS+HD- and SS-HD+ patients, with odds ratios of 2.93 (P = 0.002) and 3.02 (P < 0.001), respectively. SS+HD+ subjects had the highest risk of hematoma growth, with an odds ratio of 9.50 (P < 0.001).

- **Conclusions**: Integration of SS and HD is a significant predictor of ICH expansion risk.

### Interrater and intrarater measurement reliability of noncontrast computed tomography predictors of intracerebral hemorrhage expansion [^115Yq9CF]. Stroke (2019). Low credibility.

Early hematoma expansion after intracerebral hemorrhage is a potentially modifiable predictor of outcome and a promising therapeutic target. Radiological markers seen on noncontrast computed tomography can help predict hematoma expansion and risk stratify patients presenting with intracerebral hemorrhage. Our objective was to assess the interrater and intrarater reliability of five commonly reported noncontrast computed tomographic markers of hematoma expansion.

- **Methods**: Four readers independently reviewed images from 40 patients from two intracerebral hemorrhage imaging databases (PREDICT Collaboration [Predicting Haematoma Growth and Outcome in Intracerebral Haemorrhage Using Contrast Bolus CT] and Massachusetts General Hospital). Readers were blind to all demographic and outcome data and used accepted definitions to establish the presence or absence of intrahematoma hypodensities, blend sign, fluid level, irregular hematoma morphology, and heterogeneous hematoma density. We calculated interrater and intrarater agreement and stratified kappas for the five imaging markers.

- **Results**: Interrater agreement was excellent for all five markers, ranging from 94% to 98%. Interrater kappas ranged from 0.67 to 0.91, with the lowest for fluid level. Intrarater agreement had a similar pattern, ranging from 89% to 93%, with kappas ranging from 0.60 to 0.89.

- **Conclusions**: We show that five commonly used noncontrast computed tomographic imaging findings all have good-to-excellent interrater and intrarater reliabilities, with the best kappa for blend sign, hypodensities, and heterogeneity.

### Absolute risk and predictors of the growth of acute spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage: A systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data [^1164mvCK]. The Lancet Neurology (2018). High credibility.

- **Research in context**:

	- **Evidence before this study**: We conducted a systematic review of studies on the risk and associations of intracerebral haemorrhage growth, published in OVID MEDLINE from January 1, 1970, to December 31, 2015. Using a comprehensive search strategy limited to humans, we combined terms related to intracerebral haemorrhage such as "exp basal ganglia hemorrhage/", "intracranial hemorrhages/", "cerebral hemorrhage/", and "intracranial hemorrhage, hypertensive/" with text words like "expansion", "growth", or "enlargement", without language restrictions. Updating the search to March 1, 2018, we identified reports of five new cohorts, amounting to a 10% increase in eligible patients compared to the 36 cohorts that provided individual patient data in this meta-analysis. These five new cohorts were not included in our analyses. It is known that the risk of intracerebral haemorrhage growth is highest soon after symptom onset; however, absolute risks over time and by baseline volume remain unclear. Although several risk factors associated with intracerebral haemorrhage growth have been identified, inconsistencies across studies necessitate further determination of the predictive values of these risk factors.

	- **Added value of this study**: Our systematic review pooled data from 5435 eligible patients across 36 cohorts, making it the largest patient-level meta-analysis to investigate the absolute risk and predictors of intracerebral haemorrhage growth. We found…

### Systematic characterization of the computed tomography angiography spot SIGN in primary intracerebral hemorrhage identifies patients at highest risk for hematoma expansion: The spot SIGN score [^113Pp2fs]. Stroke (2009). Low credibility.

The presence of active contrast extravasation (the spot sign) on computed tomography (CT) angiography has been recognized as a predictor of hematoma expansion in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage. We aim to systematically characterize the spot sign to identify features that are most predictive of hematoma expansion and construct a spot sign scoring system.

- **Methods**:
	- We retrospectively reviewed CT angiograms performed in all patients who presented to our emergency department over a 9-year period with primary intracerebral hemorrhage and had a follow-up noncontrast head CT within 48 hours of the baseline CT angiogram. Three neuroradiologists reviewed the CT angiograms and determined the presence and characteristics of spot signs according to strict radiological criteria. Baseline and follow-up intracerebral hemorrhage volumes were determined by computer-assisted volumetric analysis.

- **Results**:
	- We identified spot signs in 71 of 367 CT angiograms (19%), 6 of which were delayed spot signs (8%). The presence of any spot sign increased the risk of significant hematoma expansion (69%, OR = 92, P ≤ .001). Spot signs, characterized by a maximum number ≥ 3, a maximum axial dimension ≥ 5 mm, and maximum attenuation ≥ 180 Hounsfield units, were independent predictors of significant hematoma expansion. These factors were used to construct the spot sign score. In multivariate analysis, the spot sign score was the strongest predictor of significant hematoma expansion, independent of time from ictus to CT angiogram evaluation.

### Noncontrast computed tomography signs as predictors of hematoma expansion, clinical outcome, and response to tranexamic acid in acute intracerebral hemorrhage [^111u3R2y]. Stroke (2020). High credibility.

The TICH-2 trial was a prospective randomized placebo-controlled trial testing the efficacy and safety of intravenous tranexamic acid in patients with acute spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) presenting within 8 hours of symptom onset. Details of the trial were previously published. Ethics approval was obtained from the local institutional review board, and written informed consent was obtained from patients or relatives before enrollment. After the publication of the planned primary and secondary analyses, the trial data can be shared upon reasonable request to the corresponding author and trial steering committee.

An NCCT was required for the diagnosis of spontaneous ICH before recruitment and randomization. All CT brain scans were performed according to local protocol. CT scans were obtained from any scanner from any manufacturer, and any slice thickness with a minimum of an axial view was accepted. CT scans with incomplete or missing slices were excluded. Baseline scans were performed before randomization.

Follow-up CT scans were conducted at 24 ± 12 hours after the baseline scans. When multiple scans were available, the scan closest to 24 hours after randomization was used to determine hematoma expansion. An exception was made if the 24-hour CT was performed after neurosurgery, in which case a preoperative CT scan was used instead. A participant would be excluded from analysis for hematoma expansion if no follow-up scans or only post-surgery scans were available.

### Standards for detecting, interpreting, and reporting noncontrast computed tomographic markers of intracerebral hemorrhage expansion [^113PCLWk]. Annals of Neurology (2019). Low credibility.

Significant hematoma expansion (HE) affects one-fifth of people within 24 hours after acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), and its prevention is an appealing treatment target. Although the computed tomography (CT)-angiography spot sign predicts HE, only a minority of ICH patients receive contrast injection. Conversely, noncontrast CT (NCCT) is used to diagnose nearly all ICH, so NCCT markers represent a widely available alternative for the prediction of HE. However, different NCCT signs describe similar features, with a lack of consensus on the optimal image acquisition protocol, assessment, terminology, and diagnostic criteria. In this review, we propose practical guidelines for detecting, interpreting, and reporting NCCT predictors of HE.

### Predicting intracerebral hemorrhage growth with the spot SIGN: The effect of onset-to-scan time [^116zdQCv]. Stroke (2016). Low credibility.

Hematoma expansion after acute intracerebral hemorrhage is common and associated with early deterioration and poor clinical outcomes. The computed tomographic angiography (CTA) spot sign is a promising predictor of expansion. However, its frequency and predictive values are variable across studies, possibly due to differences in onset-to-CTA time. We performed a patient-level meta-analysis to define the relationship between onset-to-CTA time and the frequency and predictive ability of the spot sign.

- **Methods**: We completed a systematic review of studies on the CTA spot sign and hematoma expansion. Subsequently, we pooled patient-level data on the frequency and predictive values for significant hematoma expansion according to five predefined categorized onset-to-CTA times. We calculated spot-sign frequency both as raw and frequency-adjusted rates.

- **Results**: Among 2051 studies identified, 12 met our inclusion criteria. Baseline hematoma volume, spot-sign status, and time-to-CTA were available for 1176 patients, and 1039 patients had follow-up computed tomographies for hematoma expansion analysis. The overall spot sign frequency was 26%, decreasing from 39% within 2 hours of onset to 13% beyond 8 hours (P < 0.001). There was a significant decrease in hematoma expansion in spot-positive patients as onset-to-CTA time increased (P = 0.004), with positive predictive values decreasing from 53% to 33%.

- **Conclusions**: The frequency of the CTA spot sign is inversely related to intracerebral hemorrhage onset-to-CTA time. Furthermore, the positive predictive value of the spot sign decreases as the onset-to-CTA time increases.

### Spot SIGN in intracerebral hemorrhage: Critical reappraisal and future clinical implications [^1147oTmC]. Stroke (2025). Low credibility.

Hematoma expansion (HE) is a common occurrence, affecting around 10% to 30% of patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage within the initial hours from symptom onset and is the only modifiable factor associated with poor clinical outcomes. The detection of contrast extravasation on computed tomography (CT) angiography, known as the spot sign, was initially embraced as a promising radiological marker for predicting HE that could aid patient selection for acute interventions aimed at minimizing HE. However, the initial enthusiasm waned as clinical studies failed to show clear clinical benefits of hemostatic treatments when patients were selected based on the presence of this imaging marker.

In this narrative review, we provide a comprehensive summary of the pathophysiology, definitions, imaging protocols, and predictive performance of the spot sign, along with the clinical studies that have selected and treated patients based on its presence. Finally, we delve into some nuances of the spot sign that can enhance its predictive performance and help stratify HE risk with greater precision. These features include static findings observed on single-phase CT angiography (i.e. number, volume, CT density, and colocalization with hypodensities) as well as dynamic findings identified on multiphase/dynamic CT angiography (i.e. timing of appearance, volume increase, volume decrease for tissue dispersion, and CT density changes).

In this reappraisal of the spot sign, we aim to reinvigorate research on advanced neuroimaging in intracerebral hemorrhage that could lead to more accurate HE prediction.

### Noncontrast computed tomography hypodensities predict poor outcome in intracerebral hemorrhage patients [^111tuu2K]. Stroke (2016). Low credibility.

Noncontrast computed tomographic (CT) hypodensities have been shown to be associated with hematoma expansion in intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), but their impact on functional outcome is yet to be determined. We evaluated whether baseline noncontrast CT hypodensities are associated with poor clinical outcomes.

We performed a retrospective review of a prospectively collected cohort of consecutive patients with primary ICH presenting to a single academic medical center between 1994 and 2016. The presence of CT hypodensities was assessed by two independent raters on the baseline CT. An unfavorable outcome was defined as a modified Rankin score > 3 at 90 days. The associations between CT hypodensities and unfavorable outcomes were investigated using uni- and multivariable logistic regression models.

During the study period, 1342 patients presented with ICH, and 800 met the restrictive inclusion criteria (baseline CT available for review, and 90-day outcome available). Three hundred four (38%) patients showed hypodensities on CT, and 520 (65%) patients experienced unfavorable outcomes. In univariate analysis, patients with unfavorable outcomes were more likely to demonstrate hypodensities (48% versus 20%; P < 0.0001). After adjustment for age, admission Glasgow Coma Scale, warfarin use, intraventricular hemorrhage, baseline ICH volume, and location, CT hypodensities were found to be independently associated with an increase in the odds of unfavorable outcome (odds ratio 1.70, 95% confidence interval [1.10–2.65]; P = 0.018).

### Absolute risk and predictors of the growth of acute spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage: A systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data [^112KWnw1]. The Lancet. Neurology (2018). High credibility.

To assess the additional predictive value of the spot sign on CT angiography, we evaluated the performance of a third prediction model. This model included 837 patients from six cohorts with available data on all covariates. Here, "spot" is an indicator variable for the presence of a CT angiography spot sign, taking values 1 for present and 0 for absent.

The presence of the spot sign was strongly and independently associated with the occurrence of intracerebral haemorrhage growth. It improved the C-index of the prediction model by 0.05 (95% CI 0.03–0.07) from 0.78 (0.75–0.82) to 0.83 (0.80–0.86).

- **Multivariable models of predictors of intracerebral haemorrhage growth**: These models focused on patients with assessment of CT angiography spot sign, data on antiplatelet therapy, and data on anticoagulant therapy use at symptom onset.

### Computed tomography in acute intracerebral hemorrhage: Neuroimaging predictors of hematoma expansion and outcome [^116nY2Hw]. Insights into Imaging (2022). High credibility.

White matter hyperintensities and enlarged perivascular spaces are predictive of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) when located in the lobar regions, and of hypertensive arteriopathy when located in the deep and infratentorial regions. Susceptibility-weighted MRI can show small foci of susceptibility blooming in the cerebral white matter, which aids in the clinical diagnosis of CAA. CT and MRI imaging features that predict CAA are shown in Fig. 4.

- **Cerebral amyloid angiopathy imaging features**: Examples of imaging features of CAA on CT and MRI are detailed as follows. CT imaging predictors of CAA (panel A and B) show intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) with multifocal components (black asterisks), finger-like projections (black arrowheads), subarachnoid hemorrhage component (black arrow), and subdural hemorrhage component (gray arrow). MRI of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (panel C) shows multiple lobar cerebral microbleeds (white arrows) and cortical superficial siderosis (white arrowheads).

The role of neuroimaging in predicting prognosis following ICH is an essential focus of current research.

### Co-localization of NCCT hypodensity and CTA spot SIGN predicts substantial intracerebral hematoma expansion: The black-&-white SIGN [^113Cumb5]. European Stroke Journal (2025). Low credibility.

The primary outcome was hematoma expansion, defined as ICH volume growth of at least 6 mL or 33% between the initial and final volumes. Secondary outcomes included hematoma expansion based on both ⩾6 mL and ⩾33%, severe hematoma expansion (⩾12.5 mL or ⩾66%), absolute and relative hematoma growth as continuous variables, final hematoma volume, functional outcome using the 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS), and mortality. Additionally, we included absolute and relative hematoma expansion scales: Intracranial Hemorrhage Expansion Scale (ICrHES) cut-offs (75%).

Continuous variables were presented as medians and interquartile ranges (IQR), while categorical variables were reported as counts and percentages. Baseline clinical and radiological features, as well as outcomes, were compared between patients with and without the B&W sign on baseline CT. Univariable comparisons were conducted using Fisher's exact test for categorical variables and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables.

The diagnostic performance of the B&W sign, along with possible combinations of the spot sign and hypodensity sign, for predicting HE was assessed using sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, positive and negative likelihood ratio, and overall accuracy.

As part of a sensitivity analysis, we assessed the association between the possible combinations of radiological markers (SS−HS+, SS+HS−, SS+HS+, or B&W).

### Different criteria for defining "spot SIGN" in intracerebral hemorrhage show different abilities to predict hematoma expansion and clinical outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1132EeVW]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Low credibility.

The "spot sign" is a well-known radiological marker used for predicting hematoma expansion and clinical outcomes in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We performed a meta-analysis to assess the predictive accuracy of the spot sign, depending on the criteria used to identify them. We conducted a systematic review of clinical studies that clearly stated their definition of the spot sign and were indexed in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases. We collected data on computed tomography (CT) parameters, spot sign diagnostic criteria, hematoma expansion, and clinical outcomes. Based on the eligibility criteria, we included 17 studies in this systematic review.

CT imaging modality, type, time from symptom onset to CT, time from contrast infusion to scan, slice thickness, tube current, and tube electric discharge showed variation across studies. Three different definitions of the spot sign were applied:

- **Hyperdense spot**: A hyperdense spot within the hematoma.
- **Contrast pooling**: One or more focal areas/regions of contrast pooling of any size and morphology that occurred within a hemorrhage, were discontinuous from the normal or abnormal vasculature adjacent to the hemorrhage, and showed an attenuation rate ≥ 120 UH.
- **Serpiginous or spot-like contrast**: Serpiginous or spot-like contrast density on CTA images that occurred within the hematoma margin, showed twice the density of the hematoma background, and did not contact vessels outside the hematoma.

All identified definitions of the spot sign were associated with hematoma expansion, mortality, and unfavorable clinical outcomes.

### Derivation and validation of three intracerebral hemorrhage expansion scores using different CT modalities [^116NNrbx]. European Radiology (2023). High credibility.

To derive and validate three scores for predicting intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) expansion based on the use of non-contrast CT (NCCT), single-phase CTA, or multiphase CTA markers. The study also evaluates the added value of single-phase and multiphase CTA over NCCT.

- **Methods**: After prospectively deriving NCCT, single-phase CTA, and multiphase CTA hematoma expansion scores, the study included 156 patients with ICH of 6 mL or > 33% at 24 hours.

- **Results**: Evaluation of single-phase and multiphase CTA markers showed a steady increase in discrimination for substantial hematoma expansion over NCCT markers. The C-index (95% confidence interval) in derivation and validation cohorts was 0.69 (0.58–0.80) and 0.59 (0.46–0.72) for the NCCT score, which was significantly lower than 0.75 ([0.64–0.87], p = 0.038) and 0.72 ([0.59–0.84], p = 0.016) for the single-phase CTA score, and 0.79 ([0.68–0.89], p = 0.033) and 0.73 ([0.62–0.85], p = 0.031) for the multiphase CTA score, respectively. The three scores demonstrated good calibration in both derivation and validation cohorts: NCCT (χ² statistic 0.389, p = 0.533; and χ² statistic 0.352, p = 0.553), single-phase CTA (χ² statistic 2.052, p = 0.359; and χ² statistic 2.230, p = 0.328), and multiphase CTA (χ² statistic 0.559, p = 0.455; and χ² statistic 0.020, p = 0.887) scores, respectively.

This study demonstrates the added prognostic value of more advanced CT modalities in acute ICH evaluation.

### Absolute risk and predictors of the growth of acute spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage: A systematic review and meta-analysis of individual patient data [^112XNcck]. The Lancet Neurology (2018). High credibility.

When assessing the two variables with non-linear associations, we found that in patients not taking anticoagulant therapy at intracerebral haemorrhage onset, the predicted probability of intracerebral haemorrhage growth declined with increasing time from intracerebral haemorrhage symptom onset to baseline imaging. The rate of decline was steepest 0.5–3 hours after intracerebral haemorrhage symptom onset (figure 2A). The predicted probability of intracerebral haemorrhage growth increased with increasing intracerebral haemorrhage volume on baseline brain imaging and peaked at about 75 mL, above which it declined (figure 2B).

We aimed to quantify the associations between 17 additional variables and the occurrence of intracerebral haemorrhage growth (appendix). There were too few patients with data for six variables (previous intracerebral haemorrhage, previous ischaemic stroke, history of liver disease, history of excessive alcohol consumption, platelet count at presentation, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score at presentation). Therefore, we selected 13 of the 19 variables as potential predictors for a multivariable model in patients not taking anticoagulant therapy, on the basis of maximizing the number of predictors being considered while also maximizing the number of patients with complete data for all the predictors chosen for the subset: time from symptom onset to baseline imaging, intracerebral haemorrhage volume on baseline imaging, sex, age, and previous stroke history.

### Effect of CTA tube current on spot SIGN detection and accuracy for prediction of intracerebral hemorrhage expansion [^114AstxZ]. AJNR. American Journal of Neuroradiology (2016). Low credibility.

Reduction of CT tube current is an effective strategy to minimize radiation load. However, tube current is also a major determinant of image quality. We investigated the impact of CTA tube current on spot sign detection and diagnostic performance for intracerebral hemorrhage expansion.

- **Materials and methods**: We retrospectively analyzed a prospectively collected cohort of consecutive patients with primary intracerebral hemorrhage from January 2001 to April 2015 who underwent CTA. The study population was divided into two groups according to the median CTA tube level: low current (< 350 mA) and high current (≥ 350 mA). CTA first-pass readings for spot sign presence were independently analyzed by two readers. Baseline and follow-up hematoma volumes were assessed by semiautomated computer-assisted volumetric analysis. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and accuracy of spot sign in predicting hematoma expansion were calculated.

- **Results**: This study included 709 patients (288 and 421 in the low- and high-current groups, respectively). A higher proportion of low-current scans identified at least one spot sign (20.8% versus 14.7%, P = 0.034), but hematoma expansion frequency was similar in the two groups (18.4% versus 16.2%, P = 0.434). Sensitivity and positive and negative predictive values were not significantly different between the two groups. Conversely, high-current scans showed superior specificity (91% versus 84%, P = 0.015) and overall accuracy (84% versus 77%, P = 0.038).

- **Conclusions**: CTA obtained at high levels of tube current exhibited…

### Calculation of prognostic scores, using delayed imaging, outperforms baseline assessments in acute intracerebral hemorrhage [^117A1GZP]. Stroke (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) are often subject to rapid deterioration due to hematoma expansion. Prognostic scores are largely based on the assessment of baseline radiographic characteristics and do not account for subsequent changes. We propose that calculation of prognostic scores using delayed imaging will have better predictive values for long-term mortality compared with baseline assessments.

We analyzed prospectively collected data from the multicenter PREDICT study (Prediction of Hematoma Growth and Outcome in Patients With Intracerebral Hemorrhage Using the CT-Angiography Spot Sign). We calculated the ICH Score, Functional Outcome in Patients With Primary Intracerebral Hemorrhage (FUNC) Score, and modified ICH Score using imaging data at initial presentation and at 24 hours. The primary outcome was mortality at 90 days. We generated receiver operating characteristic curves for all three scores, both at baseline and at 24 hours, and assessed predictive accuracy for 90-day mortality with their respective area under the curve. Competing curves were assessed with nonparametric methods.

The analysis included 280 patients, with a 90-day mortality rate of 25.4%. All three prognostic scores calculated using 24-hour imaging were more predictive of mortality compared with baseline: the area under the curve was 0.82 at 24 hours (95% CI, 0.76–0.87) compared with 0.78 at baseline (95% CI, 0.72–0.84) for ICH Score, 0.84 at 24 hours (95% CI, 0.79–0.89) compared with 0.76 at baseline (95% CI, 0.70–0.83) for FUNC, and 0.82 at 24 hours.

### Leakage SIGN for primary intracerebral hemorrhage: A novel predictor of hematoma growth [^111NsDB3]. Stroke (2016). Low credibility.

Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is a devastating disease with higher rates of mortality and morbidity than those of ischemic stroke. Expansion of ICH, which occurs in ≤ 40% of patients with ICH, has been identified as one of the most important determinants of early neurological deterioration and poor clinical outcomes in primary ICH. However, a method to reliably identify patients at risk of poor outcomes is lacking. Several retrospective studies have suggested that contrast extravasation on computed tomographic angiography (CTA), called the spot sign, might serve as a crucial predictor of hematoma expansion and mortality.

A recent study evaluating the accuracy of the spot sign for predicting hematoma expansion reported a sensitivity of 53% (95% confidence interval, 49% to 57%) and specificity of 88% (95% confidence interval, 86% to 89%) based on findings in the arterial phase of CTA. Due to the low sensitivity, a modified spot sign has been described, with consistent evolution in sites of active extravasation using dynamic CTA with an acquisition protocol involving a longer imaging time of > 60 s.

Aiming to find a more reliable method of predicting hematoma expansion, we established a new method called the leakage sign. After performing CTA, we conducted another scan 5 minutes later and analyzed these two images (arterial phase and delayed phase). In this study, we analyzed the effectiveness of the leakage sign as a predictor of ICH expansion.

### Computed tomography in acute intracerebral hemorrhage: Neuroimaging predictors of hematoma expansion and outcome [^116aq1VL]. Insights into Imaging (2022). Low credibility.

The ICH score is used as a prognostic tool and is calculated based on the patient's presenting Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, age, the presence or absence of infratentorial hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) volume, and the presence of intraventricular hemorrhage. Several prognostic scores for ICH are available, though most are not fully validated and are not widely used in routine clinical practice. Future scores need to be developed with standardized timing, preferably using more than one time point, incorporating standardized outcome assessments based on the modified Rankin Scale, and including patient-reported outcome measures.

- **Intracerebral hemorrhage score**: Associated with mortality rates linked to a total score of 0–5p.
