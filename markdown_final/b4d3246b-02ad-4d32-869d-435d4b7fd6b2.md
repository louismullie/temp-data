## Question

Multiple band/septations within the uterine cavity.
2. More focal hypoechoic nodularity at the level of the lower uterine segment
could represent hemorrhage. This was not definitely seen prior to catheter
insertion and could be posttraumatic.

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to interpret and manage multiple intrauterine bands/septations and a new focal hypoechoic nodularity in the lower uterine segment that could represent hemorrhage, with attention to post-catheterization trauma and a structured differential, workup, and management plan. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and immediate priorities. Then, I should construct a prioritized differential diagnosis for the bands/septations. Next, I will evaluate the new hypoechoic nodularity and its temporal relationship to instrumentation. After that, I should outline a guideline-based diagnostic workup. Finally, I will synthesize likely diagnoses and propose management, including when to intervene versus observe, with supporting references throughout.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and why this matters. The presence of multiple intrauterine bands or septations raises concern for adhesions, congenital anomalies, or iatrogenic scarring, while a new focal hypoechoic area in the lower uterine segment after catheterization suggests a post-traumatic hematoma or evolving niche, and both scenarios can affect fertility, bleeding, and obstetric risk, so I need to ensure I do not jump to conclusions before correlating with history and symptoms [^1116bqCu] [^111Gq4M9].

> I will now examine the differential for multiple intrauterine bands or septations. Wait, let me verify the leading considerations: Asherman syndrome from prior instrumentation or infection is common and best characterized by saline infusion sonohysterography, which is more sensitive than routine transvaginal ultrasound for intracavitary adhesions, so I should confirm whether there is a history of curettage, infection, or prior uterine surgery before labeling this as adhesions [^1116bqCu]. Congenital uterine anomalies such as septate or bicornuate uteri can present with echogenic bands and are well delineated by 3D ultrasound or MRI, so I should double-check for duplicated cavities or fundal contour abnormalities on coronal reconstructions [^115xaeh6]. Less commonly, amniotic sheets or synechiae in pregnancy can mimic bands, but I need to check for gestational status and the presence of a gestational sac before invoking those entities [^115Rygw9].

> Next, I should review the new focal hypoechoic nodularity in the lower uterine segment and its timing after catheterization. Hold on, I should verify whether this could be a post-instrumentation hematoma; a hypoechoic collection that was not present pre-catheter and appears after manipulation is consistent with a small intramural or endometrial hematoma, and I should correlate with pain, bleeding, and hemodynamic stability before assuming a benign course [^notfound]. Alternatively, this could represent an early isthmocele or cesarean scar defect, which classically appears as a triangular hypoechoic defect at the prior hysterotomy site and may accumulate fluid or blood; I need to check for prior cesarean delivery and look for communication with the endometrial cavity on sagittal views [^111Gq4M9] [^115Ek9VJ]. But wait, what if this is a low-lying gestational sac or early cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy; if the patient is pregnant or has a positive test, I should confirm location with Doppler and consider short-interval follow-up or referral because misclassification is common early on [^113hie7X] [^1174mWhB].

> I should confirm the immediate diagnostic workup. Let me first confirm that a detailed transvaginal ultrasound with Doppler is the starting point to assess endometrial symmetry, cavity contour, and vascularity of any focal lesion, and to document the lower uterine segment and any cesarean scar niche; if adhesions are suspected, I need to ensure I obtain sagittal and transverse views and consider 3D reconstruction for cavity mapping [^1167BU5U]. If routine ultrasound is inconclusive or adhesions/anomalies are suspected, saline infusion sonohysterography is the next step because it improves detection of intracavitary pathology compared with transvaginal ultrasound alone, and I should plan to obtain pre- and post-instillation images with balloon deflation at the end to fully evaluate the cavity and lower segment [^113okATL] [^111unhW6]. If a niche is suspected or surgical planning is needed, MRI can define the depth of myometrial defect and relationship to bladder, which helps distinguish a true niche from hematoma or other mimics [^116uGG5N].

> Hold on, I should verify the timing and technique nuances that affect diagnostic yield. For suspected isthmocele, measurements can vary with menstrual phase, so standardizing scans in the early proliferative phase may improve comparability, and I should double-check that any niche measurement is done without active contractions obscuring the lower segment [^115Ek9VJ] [^111Sq7RF]. For SIS, intracervical balloon placement reduces pain and saline volume without sacrificing visualization, so I should prefer that approach when feasible and document balloon position and deflation images to avoid missing a lower segment lesion [^1119UMy5] [^1167BU5U].

> Let me consider the clinical implications and how they guide urgency. If the bands represent adhesions, fertility may be impaired and hysteroscopic lysis is the criterion standard, with postoperative strategies to prevent reformation; I need to ensure preoperative mapping is adequate to guide safe dissection and restoration of cavity anatomy [^1116bqCu]. If the hypoechoic nodularity is a post-catheter hematoma, conservative management with observation is reasonable if the patient is stable, but I should confirm stability and arrange follow-up ultrasound to document resolution; if bleeding is ongoing or heavy, intrauterine balloon tamponade is an evidence-based temporizing measure while definitive hemostasis is secured [^1147TSVp]. If a niche is confirmed, counseling should address abnormal bleeding, fertility effects, and obstetric risks, and surgical repair can be considered for symptomatic patients or those pursuing fertility, ideally in experienced hands [^111Gq4M9] [^115Ek9VJ].

> I should double-check for red flags that would change management today. If there is active heavy bleeding, hemodynamic instability, or suspected pregnancy with a low-lying sac, I need to escalate urgently with consideration of balloon tamponade, transfusion support, and expedited imaging or specialist referral, because cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy and uncontrolled hemorrhage carry high morbidity and require timely, specialized care [^1147TSVp] [^113hie7X]. If there is a history of prior cesarean and the lower uterine segment myometrium is markedly thinned, I should counsel on rupture risk in future pregnancies and consider standardized measurement protocols and follow-up, recognizing that no single cutoff is universally accepted but thinner measurements correlate with higher risk [^114RV4JZ].

> Putting this together, my synthesis is that the multiple bands or septations most likely reflect intrauterine adhesions given the absence of reported duplicated cavities, with congenital septate uterus as a secondary consideration if 3D imaging reveals a fundal indentation or duplicated endometrial canals; the new focal hypoechoic nodularity in the lower uterine segment is most consistent with a small post-catheterization hematoma, though early isthmocele remains in the differential if there is a prior cesarean scar and communication with the cavity is demonstrated [^1116bqCu] [^115xaeh6] [^111Gq4M9]. I need to ensure pregnancy is excluded before proceeding with SIS or hysteroscopic plans, and I should arrange short-interval follow-up ultrasound to confirm evolution of the nodularity and reassess the cavity, escalating to SIS or MRI if the diagnosis remains uncertain or if symptoms persist [^113BVXaU] [^1115jFPM].

The most likely cause of multiple band/septations within the uterine cavity is **intrauterine adhesions (Asherman syndrome)** [^1116bqCu], often resulting from prior instrumentation, infection, or cesarean section [^notfound]. The focal hypoechoic nodularity in the lower uterine segment most likely represents **post-catheterization hematoma** [^113aYbRZ], given its new appearance after catheter insertion and typical ultrasound features. These findings are best confirmed with **saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS)** [^113okATL] or hysteroscopy [^1116bqCu], which provide superior visualization of intrauterine adhesions and hematoma compared to standard transvaginal ultrasound [^notfound]. Management is guided by symptoms and fertility goals, with hysteroscopic adhesiolysis for adhesions [^1116bqCu] and conservative observation for hematoma unless symptomatic or persistent.

## Differential diagnosis of multiple band/septations within the uterine cavity

Several **conditions can present as multiple band-like or septation-like structures** within the uterine cavity on ultrasound:

| **Condition** | **Description** | **Clinical context** |
|-|-|-|
| Intrauterine adhesions (Asherman syndrome) | - Thin, echogenic bands bridging the endometrial cavity <br/> - Often result from trauma, infection, or surgery [^1116bqCu] | - History of curettage <br/> - Cesarean section <br/> - Infection <br/> - Infertility <br/> - Amenorrhea or hypomenorrhea |
| Congenital uterine anomalies | - Septate or bicornuate uterus with septa dividing the cavity [^115xaeh6] | - Congenital <br/> - Often incidental <br/> - May affect fertility |
| Amniotic sheets or synechiae | - Linear echogenic structures in gravid uteri <br/> - Often incidental [^115Rygw9] | - Pregnancy <br/> - Usually benign |
| Endometrial polyps or fibroids | - Focal lesions distorting the cavity <br/> - May mimic bands [^116EKSh6] | - Abnormal uterine bleeding <br/> - Infertility |

---

Given the history of catheter insertion and the absence of prior documented septations, **intrauterine adhesions are the most likely diagnosis** [^notfound].

---

## Differential diagnosis of focal hypoechoic nodularity in the lower uterine segment

The **focal hypoechoic nodularity** in the lower uterine segment may represent:

| **Condition** | **Description** | **Clinical context** |
|-|-|-|
| Post-catheterization hematoma | - Collection of blood following catheter manipulation <br/> - Typically hypoechoic on ultrasound [^notfound] | - Recent catheter insertion <br/> - May be asymptomatic or cause mild pain |
| Cesarean scar defect (isthmocele) | - Defect at the site of prior cesarean scar <br/> - May collect fluid or blood [^111Gq4M9] | - Prior cesarean section <br/> - Abnormal bleeding <br/> - Infertility |
| Endometrial polyp or fibroid | - Focal endometrial or myometrial lesions <br/> - May appear hypoechoic [^116EKSh6] | - Abnormal uterine bleeding <br/> - Infertility |
| Infection or inflammation | - Localized inflammatory changes <br/> - May appear hypoechoic | - Recent instrumentation <br/> - Fever <br/> - Pain |

---

Given the temporal relationship to catheter insertion and the absence of prior documented lesions, **post-catheterization hematoma is the most likely diagnosis** [^113aYbRZ].

---

## Clinical significance and management implications

### Intrauterine adhesions (Asherman syndrome)

Intrauterine adhesions can significantly impact fertility and menstrual function, leading to infertility, recurrent pregnancy loss, and menstrual irregularities [^1116bqCu]. Diagnosis is best confirmed by **saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS)** [^1116bqCu] or hysteroscopy, both of which provide superior visualization of intrauterine adhesions compared to standard transvaginal ultrasound [^113PZXn1]. Management typically involves **hysteroscopic adhesiolysis**, with adjuvant therapies such as estrogen therapy and intrauterine devices to prevent recurrence [^1116bqCu].

---

### Post-catheterization hematoma

Post-catheterization hematomas are typically self-limiting and resolve spontaneously with **conservative management** [^notfound]. Ultrasound follow-up is recommended to **ensure resolution**. Intervention may be required if the hematoma is **large, symptomatic, or persistent**.

---

## Recommended diagnostic approach

A **structured diagnostic approach** is recommended:

- **Transvaginal ultrasound**: Initial imaging to assess the uterine cavity and identify intrauterine lesions [^113rVk1g].
- **Saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS)**: Superior to standard ultrasound for detecting and characterizing intrauterine adhesions and other intracavitary lesions [^113okATL] [^1115jFPM].
- **Hysteroscopy**: Gold standard for diagnosis and treatment of intrauterine adhesions and other intrauterine lesions [^1166BZyC].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

The most likely diagnosis for the multiple band/septations within the uterine cavity is **intrauterine adhesions (Asherman syndrome)** [^1116bqCu], and the focal hypoechoic nodularity in the lower uterine segment is most likely a **post-catheterization hematoma** [^113aYbRZ]. Confirm these findings with **SIS or hysteroscopy** [^113okATL] and manage based on symptoms and fertility goals, with hysteroscopic adhesiolysis for adhesions and conservative management for hematoma unless symptomatic or persistent.

### Cesarean scar defects: an underrecognized cause of abnormal uterine bleeding and other gynecologic complications [^111Gq4M9]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

The gynecologic sequelae due to deficient uterine scar healing after cesarean section are only recently being identified and described. These include conditions such as abnormal bleeding, pelvic pain, infertility, and cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy, as well as a potentially higher risk of complications and difficulties during gynecologic procedures such as uterine evacuation, hysterectomy, endometrial ablation, and insertion of an intrauterine device. The proposed mechanism of abnormal uterine bleeding is a pouch or "isthmocele" in the lower uterine segment that causes delayed menstrual bleeding. The prevalence of symptomatic or clinically relevant cesarean scar defects (CSDs) ranges from 19.4% to 88%. Possible risk factors for CSD include number of cesarean sections, uterine position, labor before cesarean section, and surgical technique used to close the uterine incision. There are no accepted guidelines for the diagnostic criteria of CSD. We propose that a CSD be defined on transvaginal ultrasound or saline infusion sonohysterography as a triangular hypoechoic defect in the myometrium at the site of the previous hysterotomy. We also propose a classification system to aid in standardized classification for future research. Surgical techniques for repair of CSD include laparoscopic excision, resectoscopic treatment, vaginal revision, and endometrial ablation.

Uterus, cervix, ovaries and vulva

RT for gynaecological malignancies varies by site and stage; however, it is most commonly used for the management of locally advanced cervical and vulvar cancers and less commonly used in the treatment of other uterine and ovarian malignancies.

Post-RT findings in the female reproductive organs and pelvis are non-specific. In the early post-RT setting, increased T2 signal intensity with MRI may be seen in the cervix and vagina due to inflammatory cervicitis and vaginitis (Fig. 7). These findings can occur in conjunction with other findings of acute radiation injury in other pelvic organs such as the urinary bladder and bowel (Fig. 7). Other non-specific findings seen after acute pelvic RT include inflammatory stranding, oedema and free fluid in the pelvis. In the chronic setting, the uterus, cervix and ovaries atrophy. Low signal intensity within these organs on T2-weighted sequences is commonly observed (Figs. 9, 10 and 11). Thickening (without nodularity) and low T2 signal of the uterosacral ligaments and pelvic sidewall are also common. In younger patients the ovaries may be intentionally transposed out of the pelvis prior to RT to preserve fertility. The normal ovaries in this instance should not be mistaken for lymphadenopathy or peritoneal implants.

### Determination of isthmocele using a foley catheter during laparoscopic repair of cesarean scar defect [^116uGG5N]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Study Objective

To demonstrate a new technique of isthmocele repair via laparoscopic surgery.

Design

Case report (Canadian Task Force classification III). The local Ethics Committee waived the requirement for approval.

Setting

Isthmocele localized at a low uterine segment is a defect of a previous caesarean scar due to poor myometrial healing after surgery [1]. This pouch accumulates menstrual bleeding, which can cause various disturbances and irregularities, including abnormal uterine bleeding, infertility, pelvic pain, and scar pregnancy [2–6]. Given the absence of a clearly defined surgical method in the literature, choosing the proper approach to treating isthmocele can be arduous. Laparoscopy provides a minimally invasive procedure in women with previous caesarean scar defects.

Intervention

A 28-year-old woman, gravida 2 para 2, presented with a complaint of prolonged postmenstrual bleeding for 5 years. She had undergone 2 cesarean deliveries. Transvaginal ultrasonography revealed a hypoechogenic area with menstrual blood in the anterior lower uterine segment. Magnetic resonance imaging showed an isthmocele localized at the anterior left lateral side of the uterus, with an estimated volume of approximately 12 cm 3. After patient preparation, laparoscopy was performed. To repair the defect, the uterovesical peritoneal fold was incised and the bladder was mobilized from the lower uterine segment. During this surgery, differentiating the isthmocele from the abdomen can be challenging. Here we used a Foley catheter to identify the isthmocele. To do this, after mobilizing the bladder from the lower uterine segment, we inserted a Foley catheter into the uterine cavity through the cervical canal. We then filled the balloon of the catheter at the lower uterine segment under laparoscopic view, which allowed clear identification of the isthmocele pouch. The uterine defect was then incised. The isthmocele cavity was accessed, the margins of the pouch were debrided, and the edges were surgically reapproximated with continuous nonlocking single layer 2–0 polydioxanone sutures. We believed that single-layer suturing could provide for proper healing without necrosis due to suturation. During the procedure, the vesicouterine space was dissected without difficulty. A urine bag was collected with clear urine, and there was no gas leakage; thus, we considered a safety test for the bladder superfluous. Based on concerns about the possible increased risk of adhesions, we did not cover peritoneum over the suture. The patients experienced no associated complications, and she reported complete resolution of prolonged postmenstrual bleeding at a 3-month follow-up.

Conclusion

Even though the literature is cloudy in this area, a laparoscopic approach to repairing an isthmocele is a safe and minimally invasive procedure. Our approach described here involves inserting a Foley catheter in the uterine cavity through the cervical canal, then filling the balloon in the lower uterine segment under laparoscopic view to identify the isthmocele.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of sonohysterography and hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography [^111unhW6]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS) procedural steps — a transvaginal ultrasound examination should be performed before performing SIS; the presence of unusual pain, lesions, or purulent vaginal or cervical discharge may require rescheduling the procedure pending further evaluation or treatment; before insertion, the catheter should be flushed with sterile fluid to avoid introducing air during the study; after cleansing the external os, the cervical canal and/or uterine cavity should be catheterized using an aseptic technique, and normal saline or another contrast fluid was instilled slowly by means of manual injection under real-time ultrasound imaging; imaging should include real-time scanning of the endometrium and cervical canal.

### Use of point-of-care ultrasound to facilitate guidance and intrauterine placement of a foley urinary catheter to tamponade life-threatening postprocedure hemorrhage caused by disseminated intravascular coagulation [^113aYbRZ]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Severe vaginal hemorrhage caused by disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) after dilation and evacuation is a rare but life-threatening situation that can be difficult to manage. Obtaining hemostasis in such a patient with heavy vaginal bleeding secondary to DIC can be difficult. One technique involves the use of a urinary bladder catheter inserted into the uterus that is inflated to apply pressure on the endometrium, allowing for tamponade of the bleeding.

Case Report

A 36-year-old female gravida 2 para 0 at 21 weeks' gestation presented to the emergency department after being transferred from another facility for a higher level of care available at our facility, after a dilation and evacuation procedure that was indicated because of intrauterine fetal demise. The physical examination was significant for an ill-appearing female with active heavy vaginal bleeding. Resuscitation was initiated with packed red blood cells, cryoprecipitate, and platelets. Because of her thrombocytopenia, the development of DIC was suspected. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) was performed and showed a thickened endometrial stripe with evidence of multiple anechoic foci, which were thought to represent intrauterine clots. To tamponade the bleeding, a 30-cc standard Foley urinary bladder catheter was placed into the uterus, using POCUS for guidance, to attempt to induce hemostasis via tamponade of the bleeding after inflation of the catheter balloon. Placement of an intrauterine urinary catheter to enable tamponade can be useful for the management of uncontrolled hemorrhage, but can be difficult to accomplish without use of POCUS for guidance. POCUS enabled us to accomplish accurate intrauterine placement of the urinary catheter and confirmation of a properly placed catheter balloon within the uterus. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Menorrhagia in the emergency department can be difficult to manage, especially in the setting of DIC. Placement of an intrauterine urinary catheter can be useful in management but may be difficult for the inexperienced provider. POCUS can be used to guide the catheter into place and confirm the location once the balloon is inflated.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of sonohysterography and hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography [^111c4fdn]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography (HyCoSy) procedural steps — a transvaginal ultrasound examination should be performed before performing HyCoSy, and SIS can be performed, as described above, immediately before HyCoSy; if performing SIS, the catheter should be flushed with sterile fluid before insertion; after cleansing the external os, the cervical canal or uterine cavity should be catheterized using an aseptic technique, typically using a balloon catheter to avoid backflow of fluid during HyCoSy; appropriate sterile fluid, with air, contrast, or foam, is instilled slowly by means of manual injection under real-time ultrasound imaging; commercial devices that mix air and saline together to form the air-infused saline for HyCoSy are available, and similar results can be produced by filling a 30-mL syringe with 15 mL of saline and 15 mL of air and then pushing the plunger while rocking the syringe up and down, which effectively infuses air with saline and is easily seen on ultrasound.

### Performing the embryo transfer: a guideline [^1144JURC]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Medium credibility.

Embryo placement location during embryo transfer — distance from the uterine fundus — is summarized as follows: Four RCTs were designed to answer this question. One RCT examined three different placement locations (1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 cm) from the uterine fundus, and it found statistically significantly (P < .05) higher implantation rates for placement between 1.5 cm and 2.0 cm compared with 1.0 cm, with statistically significantly higher (P < .05) pregnancy rates when the selected location was approximately 2 cm from the uterine fundus compared with 1 cm from the fundus. When placement was compared between < 1 cm and 1–1.5 cm, one randomized controlled study demonstrated improved pregnancy rates and implantation rates at the location farther from the fundus. Two additional randomized controlled studies found no difference in implantation rate and pregnancy rate, with one study dividing placement into the upper vs lower half of the endometrial cavity and the other comparing 2 cm from the fundus vs the uterine cavity midpoint. The majority of the studies found that embryo placement impacted pregnancy rates, with pregnancy rates highest when the embryo was placed in the upper or middle area of the uterine cavity, at least 1 cm away from the fundus; a 2015 RCT demonstrated no difference when the catheter tip was 2 cm from the fundus or in the middle third of the uterine cavity. Finally, in a cohort study of 408 patients who underwent embryo transfer, overall pregnancy rates were significantly better in those patients (n = 218) for whom the outer sheath did not go beyond the internal os compared with patients (n = 190).

### ACOG technology assessment in obstetrics and gynecology no. 5: sonohysterography [^113BVXaU]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

The goal of sonohysterography is to visualize the endometrial cavity in more detail than is possible with routine transvaginal ultrasound. The procedure consists of the manual injection of sterile fluid under real-time ultrasonographic imaging. The most common indication for sonohysterography is abnormal uterine bleeding. The procedure should not be performed in a woman who is pregnant or who could be pregnant, or who has a pelvic infection or unexplained pelvic tenderness. Physicians who perform or supervise diagnostic sonohysterography should be skilled in vaginal ultrasonography and transcervical placement of catheters; should have training, experience, and demonstrated competence in gynecologic ultrasonography and sonohysterography; and should keep careful records. Portions of this document were developed jointly with the American College of Radiology and the American Institute of Ultrasound Medicine.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of detailed diagnostic obstetric ultrasound examinations between 12 Weeks 0 Days and 13 Weeks 6 Days [^112Y7kRo]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Placenta and placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) risk — evaluation and imaging technique: The placental echo texture, location, and placental cord insertion should be evaluated. In patients at risk for placenta accreta spectrum (PAS), the placenta should be examined in detail through a partially full maternal bladder, and transvaginal scanning is recommended to optimize resolution and enhance visualization of the cervix, lower uterine segment, and posterior bladder wall. The area of interest should be magnified so that it occupies at least half of the ultrasound image with the focal zone at an appropriate depth, and color Doppler imaging may be optimized by using a low-velocity scale, low filters, and high gain to maximize detection of flow. The location of the placenta with respect to the bladder, a cesarean scar (if present), and the internal cervical os should be evaluated, and low implantation of the gestational sac, defined as a placental implantation located posterior to a partially full maternal bladder, has been correlated with PAS; thus, follow-up ultrasound examinations in the second and third trimesters are recommended. The presence of lacunae should be noted, the myometrium and retroplacental hypoechoic zone should be evaluated, and Doppler imaging may be used to investigate the placental vasculature and the interface with the bladder; the placental echo texture may be abnormal in triploidy and placental mesenchymal dysplasia, and chorionicity and amnionicity should be definitively determined for multiple gestations.

### Foley catheter-assisted laparoscopic treatment of type II cesarean scar pregnancy [^115iUVu1]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Cesarean scar pregnancy (CSP) is an ectopic pregnancy in which the zygote implants in the scar of a previous cesarean section. In type II CSP the zygote implants more deeply. We report a retrospective case series of 8 patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery with the aid of a Foley catheter deployed in the lower uterine segment under ultrasound guidance at the beginning of the surgery. This approach facilitates locating, identifying, and removing the lesion. It also may reduce bleeding via wound compression.

### Intraluminal pressure in a uterine tamponade balloon is curvilinearly related to the volume of fluid infused [^117JnfVr]. American Journal of Perinatology (2011). Low credibility.

We studied the effect of incremental infusion of fluid volume in a tamponade balloon on intraluminal pressure and uterine blood flow. Following placental delivery, a tamponade balloon was inserted into the uterus and incrementally inflated. Intraluminal pressure was measured at incremental volumes. Ultrasound was used to determine positioning of the catheter, uterine wall thickness, and uterine artery velocity waveforms in eight patients. Pressure-volume relationship was estimated by regression analysis. Significance was p < 0.05. There was a significant exponential curvilinear relationship between balloon pressure and infused volume at the maximum volume for each subject (R = 0.64, p = 0.01). Doppler ultrasound showed that at or above 1000 mL inflation volume, 5/6 patients (83%) showed reversal of uterine artery diastolic flow. At maximal inflation volume, all of the patients with reversed diastolic flow had intraluminal pressure less than systolic blood pressure. Intraluminal pressure increases curvilinearly as volume of an intrauterine tamponade balloon is increased. The mechanism of action of tamponade balloons is likely related to a reduction in uterine artery perfusion pressure. Whether this is the result of direct compression of the artery in the lower segment or due to wall conformational changes is not clear.

### Abnormal uterine bleeding: the role of ultrasound [^116usKWv]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Abnormal uterine bleeding is an important clinical concern and accounts for much medical intervention. This article presents an ultrasound-based approach to help exclude endometrial carcinoma and identify the source of bleeding for better clinical management. Saline infusion sonohysterography can help to triage patients to (1) no anatomic pathology, (2) globally thickened anatomic pathology that may be evaluated with blind endometrial sampling, or (3) focal abnormalities that must be evaluated under direct vision.

### Contractions of the lower uterine segment during transvaginal ultrasound cervical length: incidence, significance, proper measurement, and management [^111Sq7RF]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2024). Medium credibility.

An accurate transvaginal ultrasound cervical length is paramount to obtain the best prediction for preterm birth. Transvaginal ultrasound cervical length should be optimally obtained when a lower uterine segment contraction is not seen. For universal transvaginal ultrasound cervical length screening at approximately 20 weeks of gestation, the options are to do the transvaginal ultrasound soon after bladder void (lower uterine segment contractions present in 16%-43% of this approach) or to wait until the end of the anatomy scan (ideally within 30 minutes after bladder voiding) to decrease the chance of a lower uterine segment contraction. If the lower uterine segment contraction persists even after waiting up to 20 minutes or more, only the true transvaginal ultrasound cervical length should be reported. In particular, in patients with a previous spontaneous preterm birth, if the lower uterine segment contraction persists, the transvaginal ultrasound cervical length can be repeated in ≤ 7 days even in the presence of a normal (> 25 mm) cervical length. Similar to a blood pressure cuff that must be of the right size for proper blood pressure measurement and a glucometer that must be properly calibrated, screening with transvaginal ultrasound cervical length should only be performed following a proper and standardized technique, including avoiding as much as feasible the presence of lower uterine segment contractions.

### Technology assessment no. 12: sonohysterography [^113PZXn1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

The primary goal of sonohysterography is to visualize the endometrial cavity in more detail than is possible with routine transvaginal ultrasonography. Sonohysterography also can be used to assess tubal patency. The indications for sonohysterography include, but are not limited to, evaluation of the following: abnormal uterine bleeding; uterine cavity, especially with regard to uterine leiomyomata, polyps, and synechiae; abnormalities detected on transvaginal ultrasonography, including focal or diffuse endometrial or intracavitary abnormalities; congenital abnormalities of the uterus; infertility; recurrent pregnancy loss; and suboptimal visualization of the endometrium on transvaginal ultrasonography. Sonohysterography should not be performed in a woman who is pregnant or who could be pregnant. Credentialing obstetrician-gynecologists to perform or supervise diagnostic sonohysterography should be based on education, training, experience, and demonstrated competence in performing and interpreting trans-vaginal ultrasonography and sonohysterography. The obstetrician-gynecologist should be skilled in the transcervical placement of catheters. The sonohysterography procedure, including benefits and risks, should be explained fully to the patient before the procedure is performed.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of detailed diagnostic obstetric ultrasound examinations between 12 Weeks 0 Days and 13 Weeks 6 Days [^112AGECC]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2021). High credibility.

AIUM practice parameter — placenta and placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) assessment includes documenting the position of the placenta (including its relationship with the lower uterine segment, internal cervical os, and cesarean scar site when applicable), umbilical cord insertion into the placenta, and the echo texture of the placenta with a note to observe for heterogeneity, masses, cystic spaces, or lacunae. The table lists color Doppler evaluation and assessment of myometrial thinning (subjective)/loss of the retroplacental clear zone, bladder wall interface, and uterine vesical vascularity; it specifies that placental position should be reported if centrally located over the internal cervical os, history of cesarean delivery, or suspicion for PAS, that color Doppler is required if suspicious for PAS, and states that in suspected PAS, transvaginal imaging through a partially full bladder is recommended; additional comments note potential fundal expansion of a previously documented low‑lying gestational sac or cesarean scar pregnancy with advancing gestation and that if the placenta is anterior and under the cesarean scar site, the villi remain anchored there, a characteristic of PAS.

### Sonography of lower uterine segment thickness and prediction of uterine rupture [^116MEusj]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Sonographic evaluation of the lower uterine segment was undertaken to study the degree of thinning and, thus, to predict uterine rupture. However, the best measuring technique and recommended cutoff values remain controversial.

Case

Sonographic evaluation of the lower uterine segment at 36 weeks of gestation in a 31-year-old patient with prior low transverse cesarean delivery revealed a full thickness of 3.6 mm and a myometrial layer of 1.1 mm. Nevertheless, the patient experienced a large uterine rupture during a trial of labor at term.

Conclusion

In this case, there was a discrepancy between the full thickness and the myometrial layer, which could be representative of the lower uterine segment resistance. Such a case emphasizes the need for a consensus on sonographic measuring techniques for the prediction of uterine rupture.

### ACOG technology assessment no. 8: sonohysterography [^112VFgr4]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

The primary goal of sonohysterography is to visualize the endometrial cavity in more detail than is possible with routine transvaginal ultrasonography. The procedure consists of the transcervical injection of sterile fluid under real-time ultrasound imaging. The indications for sonohysterography include, but are not limited to, the evaluation of abnormal uterine bleeding; uterine cavity, especially with regard to uterine leiomyomas, polyps, and synechiae; abnormalities detected on transvaginal ultrasonography, including focal or diffuse endometrial or intracavitary abnormalities; congenital abnormalities of the uterus; infertility; and recurrent pregnancy loss. The procedure should not be performed in a woman who is pregnant or who could be pregnant or who has an existing pelvic infection or unexplained pelvic tenderness. Physicians who perform or supervise diagnostic sonohysterography should be skilled in vaginal ultrasonography and transcervical placement of catheters; should have training, experience, and demonstrated competence in gynecologic ultrasonography and sonohysterography; and should keep careful records. Portions of this document were developed jointly with the American College of Radiology, the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine, and the Society of Radiologists in Ultrasound.

### Isthmocele diagnosis: the optimal timing for detection [^115Ek9VJ]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

The term isthmocele refers to an iatrogenic uterine defect at the site of the scar from a previous cesarean section or other isthmic tract surgery. Uterine isthmocele affects up to 70% of women with a history of previous cesarean sections, and approximately one‐third of them exhibit symptoms such as menstrual spotting, abnormal uterine bleeding, or abdominal pain.

Factors such as multiple cesarean sections, maternal obesity, diabetes, and retroverted uteri have been associated with the typical disruption of the myometrium at the scar. Another potential causative factor is the closure technique of the hysterotomy, specifically, double‐ versus single‐layer closure. A recent meta‐analysis demonstrated that single‐layer uterine closure had a similar incidence of isthmocele as double‐layer closure 6–12 months after the cesarean section.

Accurate diagnosis is crucial as isthmocele has been linked to various gynecologic and obstetric complications such as scar pregnancy, placenta accrete spectrum disorders, and uterine rupture in subsequent pregnancies. Additionally, women with a uterine niche may experience poorer fertility outcomes due to intrauterine fluid accumulation (mainly menstrual blood and mucus), which could lead to chronic endometrial inflammation and compromise embryo implantation.

Transvaginal ultrasonography (TVU) is considered the primary diagnostic method. Isthmocele appears as a triangular anechoic indentation communicating with the endometrial cavity within the myometrium of the lower uterine segment. The exact timing for a diagnostic ultrasound has not been yet clearly defined, with several studies conducting diagnostic procedures during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. The size of the uterine niche has been shown to be different during the proliferative and secretory phases, highlighting the need to standardize the exact time of measurement.

### Postpartum hemorrhage-what the interventional radiologist should know [^113Huw4S]. CVIR Endovascular (2021). Medium credibility.

Approach to placenta accreta spectrum

Placenta accreta spectrum (PAS) encompasses all situations in which there is abnormal placental attachment. In 2019, the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics proposed an updated nomenclature for PAS with three increasing grades of severity (Jauniaux et al.): Grade 1 - formerly placenta accreta whereby the chorionic villi attach beyond the endometrium without invasion into the deeper myometrium; Grade 2 - formerly placenta increta whereby the villi invade the deeper myometrial layer; Grade 3 - formerly placenta percreta whereby the villi invade fully through the myometrium into the serosa and/or the surrounding structures.

Risk factors for PAS include prior cesarean delivery, a history of uterine instrumentation, placenta previa, advanced maternal age, multiparity, uterine anomaly, and history of PAS (Carusi). Prenatal diagnosis is crucial for appropriate triage of care prior to delivery to a tertiary prenatal center with multidisciplinary teams experienced in treating PAS. US is an excellent modality to make the diagnosis of PAS. There are several characteristic US imaging features that aid in the diagnosis of PAS such as the presence of placenta previa, multiple placental lacunae or "tornado vessels", loss of the retroplacental hypoechoic zone, retroplacental myometrial thickness < 1 mm, lower uterine segment "bulge", abnormal bladder interface, and any placental tissue identified beyond the uterine serosa (Cali et al; Collins et al.) (Fig. 4).

Fig. 4
Grey scale sonographic image showing many of the features of PAS, including loss of the retroplacental hypoechoic zone, retroplacental myometrial thickness < 1 mm, and a lower uterine segment echogenic "bulge" (arrows)

In cases of clinical ambiguity, cross sectional imaging may be employed. MRI in particular has been shown to be useful when US findings are unclear or in cases of a difficult acoustic window, most often from a posterior placenta (Baughman et al.). Some of the most reliable indirect MRI findings of PAS include uterine bulging, heterogeneous placenta, and placental bands. Direct findings include focal interruptions in the hypointense myometrial border at sites of placental invasion (Baughman et al.). The soft tissue resolution of MRI allows for increased sensitivity for extra-uterine invasion in cases of PAS Grade III which can be essential for surgical planning (Palacios Jaraquemada & Bruno).

### Intramyometrial pregnancy after cryopreserved embryo transfer: a case report [^115yVHU1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2020). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

We presented a case that a 28 year-old woman, gravida 2 para 1, had a history of 2.5 years secondary infertility. Her first pregnancy was full-term normal delivery 6 years ago. The second was spontaneous right fallopian ectopic pregnancy with right-side salpingectomy treatment 3 years ago. Then the patient underwent IVF treatment and had 2 implantation failures in the first cycle of IVF. During her second IVF cycle, she was given a GnRH antagonist regimen for controlled ovarian stimulation. The protocol for the preparation for cryopreserved embryo transfer was hormone replacement treatment (HRT). Afterwards, 2 good quality embryos were transferred into the patient's uterus under ultrasound guidance. The procedure of embryo transfer was uneventful with soft-tipped catheter, without touching the uterine wall. The serum β-hCG was 42.49 mIU/mL at the 13 day after transfer. The patient presented with no obvious symptoms, just slight protracted dripping. At 7 weeks' gestation, serum β-hCG rose to 2174.04 mIU/mL but the transvaginal ultrasonography scan revealed an empty endometrial cavity with no sign of fetal pole or yolk sac. However, a suspicious ill-defined hypoechogenic structure with 14*13 mm in size, without sigh of gestation sac nor fetal pulsation, was observed from the ultrasonography. It was seemingly between the right ovary and the uterus contour (Fig. 1). Since the patient described the history of right fallopian pregnancy and right salpingectomy treatment, we suspected a right adnexa ectopic pregnancy, especially the right interstitial fallopian or right uterus corneal pregnancy. Decision was made to proceed with exploratory laparoscopy and hysteroscopy. Under hysteroscopy, no sign of gestation sac was found. Both ostiums from fallopian tubes were seen. There was also slight intrauterine adhesion in the fundus and some decidua tissue hyperplasia. Under laparoscopy, the uterus was enlarged as 7 weeks' gestation size. The product of conception was discovered embedded in the myometrium and protruding out from the right side of the posterior uterine wall, under the right ovarian ligament, with seemingly no connection with uterine cavity nor fallopian tubes (Fig. 2). The serosa and myometrium above the conception was compressed thin, but not ruptured. The right fallopian tube was missed. The left fallopian through its entire length and both ovaries appeared grossly normal. There was no active bleeding in pelvic cavity. We first injected 5 mL arginine vasopressin with the concentration of 0.6 U/ml into the myometrium. An incision was made over the buldging myometrium from the posterior uterine wall, dark red tissue suggestive of the conception was showed and carefully explored, confirming the conception was not connected to the endometrium cavity. Since the patient described the history of right salpingectomy treatment, we couldn't confirm if the conception was connected to the right fallopian tube. The diagnosis of intramural pregnancy was suspected during the operation. Then we excised the lesion followed by repairing the defect with careful electrocoagulation. The estimated blood loss during the operation was around 100 ml. The β-hCG level dropped to 4.36 mIU/ml 14 days after the surgery. The pathological report confirmed the presence of chorionic villi in the uterine myometrium, validating the diagnosis of an intramyometrial pregnancy. There was no adenomyosis found from the tissue resected.

### Outcomes and risk factors for failed trial of labor after cesarean delivery (TOLAC) in women with one previous cesarean section: a Chinese population-based study [^115qSJr8]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Data collection

The study examined demographic, obstetric, maternal, and delivery variables. These variables were chosen based on factors that were previously linked to TOLAC in other studies and their availability in our current clinical database. The demographic variables included age, body mass index in the admission for TOLAC, gravidity, abortion; history of vaginal delivery, gestational weeks at pregnancy termination, estimated birth weight; The clinical factors includes: time from previous CD, indication for previous CD (failed trial of labor) and lower uterine segment (LUS) thickness. The maternal and neonatal outcomes included blood loss during delivery, intrapartum blood transfusion, puerperal infection, NICU admission, Apgar score (5 min, ≤ 7), injury to the bladder and incomplete or complete rupture of the muscle layer of the lower uterus. Before start of TOLAC or CD, the LUS thickness was assessed using an abdominal probe. A normal LUS for ultrasonography is a 2-layer structure consisting of an echogenic layer (the bladder wall) and a usually less echogenic layer (the myometrium). Transabdominal assessments were performed when a woman had a full bladder; the LUS was examined longitudinally and transversely to detect areas of significant uterine scarring and to measure the myometrium. All measurements were made without contractions. Indication for the previous CD (failed trial of labor) was that pregnant women who underwent prior CD because of the failure of labor, not due to other reasons such as maternal request.

If spontaneous labor has not occurred, the induction of labor will be performed according to the recommendation and the medical center's protocol. The indications for induction of labor included term pregnancy (defined as pregnancy over 40 weeks gestation), gestational diabetes mellitus, gestational hypertensive disorders, oligohydramnios or another medical indication warranting induction of labor. The Bishop score was calculated using the first digital cervical examination at the time of admission. According to the recommendation of induction of labor, women with a cervix Bishop score ≥ 5 or having premature rupture of membrane were directly induced with intravenous oxytocin. Women with a cervix Bishop score < 5 would be performed a transcervical Foley balloon catheter inflated with 70 mL of 0.9% sodium chloride solution to promote cervical ripening. After the balloon was expelled spontaneously or withdrawn after 24 h, artificial rupture of membranes or intravenous oxytocin was initiated.

### Marginal cord insertion in the first trimester is associated with furcate cord insertion [^114TbKYr]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Medium credibility.

We also noted that marginal cord insertion with the cord insertion site ≤ 5 mm from the placental edge in the first trimester was more likely to progress to furcate cord insertion compared with marginal cord insertion of > 5 mm. In agreement with our findings, previous investigations have also reported that a cord insertion site nearer to the placental edge is associated with a greater incidence of specific adverse pregnancy outcomes. In addition, this study found a higher incidence of low insertion sites progressing to furcate cord insertion than normal insertion sites. It has been proposed that inadequate blood supply is more likely to occur in the lower uterine segment, marginal cord insertion in the lower uterine segment is more likely to develop into velamentous cord insertion, and velamentous cord insertion is more likely to create vasa previa. Furthermore, this study found 3 cases of low insertion sites in the first trimester, showing that the cord insertion site was located at the edge of the placenta in the second trimester, but it was not possible to distinguish whether the cord insertion site was in the placental parenchyma or the amniotic membranes, and velamentous cord insertion was confirmed after birth. This further supports the findings of Kelley BP. The above observations may indicate that placental tissue atrophy below the cord insertion site of marginal cord insertion is explained by a trophotropism mechanism. The villous chorion adjacent to the cord insertion site is where the placenta develops. Due to starvation, the region of the placenta that is linked to the lower section of the uterus experiences adaptive changes, and the villous chorion atrophies into a smooth chorion, which causes the cord insertion site of marginal cord insertion to shift from its original position and eventually evolve into furcate cord insertion.

### Optimal catheter placement during sonohysterography: a randomized controlled trial comparing cervical to uterine placement [^1119UMy5]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate whether the position of the catheter placement into either the uterus or cervix during the saline infusion sonohysterography affected the magnitude of pain.

Methods

A clinical trial was conducted with women undergoing saline infusion sonohysterogram randomized to intracervical or intrauterine balloon catheter placement. The primary outcome end points were the degrees of pain experienced after initial inflation and then after deflation of the balloon catheter at the completion of the saline infusion sonohysterogram. Pain was quantified with a 10-point visual analog pain scale. Secondary end points included total time for the saline infusion sonohysterogram and the total volume of infused saline necessary for adequate visualization of the endometrial cavity.

Results

Thirty-five patients were randomly assigned to intracervical balloon placement and 34 to intrauterine placement. After initial inflation there was significantly less pain with intracervical than intrauterine balloon placement (1.8 compared with 3.0, P = .02), although there was no difference in pain at the end of the procedure after deflation of the balloon (P = .66). Significantly less infused saline was required with intracervical catheter placement (19 mL compared with 40 mL, P = .001). Nulliparous women had significantly more pain than did parous women, both after initial balloon inflation and at completion of the saline infusion sonohysterogram (P < .05).

Conclusion

Intracervical catheter placement results in significantly less pain during an saline infusion sonohysterography and also requires half the saline volume to perform the saline infusion sonohysterogram. Therefore, routine intracervical balloon placement should be considered for saline infusion sonohysterogram.

### Society of Family Planning clinical recommendation: management of hemorrhage at the time of abortion [^1147TSVp]. Contraception (2024). High credibility.

Abortion-related hemorrhage — balloon tamponade placement, volumes, and dwell time — Reaspiration is appropriate if there is evidence of retained tissue or hematometra; if not suspected and atony or lower uterine segment bleeding is the etiology, we recommend that clinicians place a Foley or Bakri balloon to tamponade the endometrium (GRADE 1B). Once the Foley balloon is proximal to the cervix, it may be inflated between 30 cc and 80 cc with normal saline; the Bakri can hold up to 500 cc, though case reports describe inflating 120–250 cc with successful tamponade, and these balloons should be filled only with normal saline and never with gas. In cases of hemorrhage requiring transfusion, it is reasonable to leave the balloon in place for 12 to 24 hours, whereas after rapid hemostasis a shorter course of 1 to 12 hours is often sufficient; clinicians may consider antibiotics with longer placement (12–24 hours), and after deflation allow time to assess for recurrent bleeding and refill if necessary.

### Intrauterine linear echogenicities in the gravid uterus: what radiologists should know [^115Rygw9]. Radiographics (2018). Low credibility.

Intrauterine linear echogenicity (ILE) is a common ultrasonographic finding in the gravid uterus and has variable causes and variable maternal and fetal outcomes. Correctly categorizing ILE during pregnancy is crucial for guiding surveillance and advanced imaging strategies. Common causes of ILE include membranes in multiple gestations, uterine synechiae with amniotic sheets, and uterine duplication anomalies. Less common causes include circumvallate placenta, chorioamniotic separation, and hemorrhage between membranes. Amniotic band syndrome is a rare but important diagnosis to consider, as it causes severe fetal defects. Imaging findings enable body stalk anomaly, a lethal defect, to be distinguished from amniotic bands, which although destructive are not necessarily lethal. This review describes the key imaging findings used to differentiate the various types of ILE in pregnancy, thus enabling accurate diagnosis and appropriate patient counseling.

### Etiology, risk factors, and management of asherman syndrome [^1116bqCu]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). Medium credibility.

Asherman syndrome is characterized by a triad of symptoms including pain, menstrual abnormalities, and infertility and is a result of intrauterine scar tissue after instrumentation of a gravid uterus. Saline sonohysterogram is typically the most sensitive diagnostic tool; however, hysteroscopy is the criterion standard for diagnosis. Treatment includes hysteroscopic-guided lysis of adhesion, with restoration of the anatomy of the uterine cavity. Several modalities are used in an attempt to reduce the reformation of scar tissue after surgery; however, there is no consensus on the ideal method. Stem cells and platelet-rich plasma are being explored as means of regenerative therapy for the endometrium, but data remain limited. At present, most individuals can have restoration of menstrual function; however, lower pregnancy rates and obstetric complications are not uncommon. These complications are worse for patients with a higher grade of disease. Efforts are needed in standardizing classification, reducing uterine instrumentation of the gravid uterus, and referring patients to health care professionals with clinical expertise in this area.

### Imaging of the uterus after endometrial ablation [^113o9Kq7]. Radiographics (2025). Medium credibility.

Endometrial ablation (EA), a therapeutic alternative to hysterectomy for the treatment of excessive uterine bleeding, is increasing in utilization and popularity among gynecologists performing this procedure and women undergoing it. The increase in utilization of this minimally invasive surgery has resulted in the growth of intentional and nonintentional imaging of the postablation uterus. Although routinely performed cross-sectional imaging modalities such as US, CT, and MRI are expected to provide optimal assessment of the post-EA uterus, often the findings are confusing as they overlap with those of other pathologic processes seen in the uterus such as endometrial cancer and adenomyosis, resulting in misinterpretation. In addition, many radiologists are unaware of the changes in the uterus after the procedure. Moreover, many women undergo imaging for unrelated medical conditions, and this pertinent surgical history may be unknown or undocumented at the time of imaging review, making radiologic interpretations even more challenging. The radiologic literature is scarce on this topic, with few articles describing imaging findings of the postablation uterus. This striking gap in knowledge leads to a wide range of misdiagnoses and mismanagement. The authors provide a brief summary of the pathophysiology of abnormal uterine bleeding and discuss the main concepts of EA techniques, followed by a focused detailed description of the imaging findings associated with EA, which can aid in recognition of the expected changes in the uterus, as well as accurate identification, diagnosis, and prompt management of related complications. Additionally, the authors provide a review of differentiating features that can help with diagnosis of other pathologic conditions of the uterus that can mimic post-EA related changes. © RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.

If insertion is difficult because the uterus cannot be appropriately instrumented, consider the following measures:

Use of cervical anesthesia to make sounding and manipulation more tolerable.
Use of dilators to dilate the cervix if needed to allow passage of the sound or inserter.
Abdominal ultrasound guidance during dilation and/or insertion.
If there is clinical concern, exceptional pain, or bleeding during or after insertion, take appropriate steps, such as physical examination and ultrasound, immediately to exclude uterine perforation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.5)].

Counsel the patient on what to expect following LILETTA insertion. Discuss expected bleeding patterns with LILETTA use. Review the signs and symptoms associated with infection, perforation, and expulsion that may occur with use of LILETTA [see Patient Counseling Information (17)].

Prescribe analgesics, if indicated.

2.5 Patient Follow- Up

The healthcare professional should consider re-examining and evaluating patients 4 to 6 weeks after insertion and during routine care, or more frequently if clinically indicated. The IUS threads should be checked during each evaluation.

### Micturition in the toilet compared with bedpan in laboring nulliparas: a randomized controlled trial [^1177Nq3J]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

This trial was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of University Malaya Medical Centre (reference number: 2019330–7272 on 04/07/2019) and registered with ISRCTN (on 17/07/2019). The trial was performed in accordance with International Conference on Harmonization – Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) and Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consents were obtained from all participants.

We sought in our labor ward, nulliparas (no prior delivery beyond 20 weeks gestation) in labor (at least three contractions in 10 minutes, cervical dilatation within the last 2 hours of 4 to 8 cm and ruptured membrane but without evidence of second stage) who had the urge to micturate or a palpable bladder and ultrasound scan bladder volume > 300 ml, aged > 18 years old with a singleton live fetus in cephalic presentation for trial participation. An adult functional bladder can comfortably hold between 300 and 400 ml. Wall pressure of 5–15 mmHg creates a sensation of bladder fullness while 30 mmHg and beyond is painful. For this trial a filled bladder that warrants voiding is defined as the urge to micturate or a palpable bladder and ultrasound bladder volume > 300 ml. Women with known bladder dysfunction, recurrent antenatal urinary tract infections, lower segment uterine fibroid, on neuraxial analgesia and prior bedpan or urine catheter use during labor were excluded. Eligible women were approached, verbally informed and provided with the participant information sheet by the investigator (WKC). Written informed consents were obtained from all participants. Relevant demographic and clinical data were recorded in the Case Report Form.

Pre and postvoid ultrasound for bladder volume was performed (solely by investigator WKC) using a 3.5 MHz convex transducer with the participant in semi-recumbent position. Bladder measurements were performed in two planes (transverse and sagittal images) in between contractions. For transverse image, the transducer is positioned horizontally along the long axis of the bladder, and adjusted until the maximum transverse section is found and the maximum transverse width measured (horizontal diameter). For the sagittal image, the transducer is rotated 90-degree into the sagittal plane, position adjusted until the maximum sagittal section is obtained and sagittal depth and height were then measured. Sonographic measurements were recorded for sagittal height, sagittal depth and transverse width of the bladder (i.e. h, d and w). Using the prolate ellipsoid method, volume = 0.52 x h x d x w.

Surgical and interventional procedures for PAS-complicated pregnancies

The surgical procedures and radiological interventions were carried out in accordance with the methods detailed in our previous publications. In this study, we have structured the description of these procedures according to the different surgical phases: preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative.

Preoperative preparation included (1) placental MRI, combined transvaginal and transabdominal ultrasound scoring for placental evaluation, blood preparation, and multidisciplinary team discussions. (2) The lead surgeon conducted a bedside ultrasound immediately before surgery to verify fetal position, placental location, and the relationship between the placenta and fetal presentation. The surgeon also assessed the positioning of the abdominal wall and uterine incision, marking these areas as needed. (3) For patients receiving balloon occlusion, a Gold PTA Dilatation catheter (BD Atlas, Bard Peripheral Vascular Inc, Arizona, USA) with a balloon diameter of 18 mm, a balloon length of 40 mm, and a shaft length of 120 cm was placed through jugular vein for occluding the internal iliac artery and radial artery puncture were performed to enable invasive blood pressure monitoring.

Intraoperative procedures included: (1) For cases where the placenta could be avoided, the uterine incision was made above the upper placental margin. If the placenta was broadly attached to the anterior uterine wall, entry was made through the thinnest placental region, with a double incision if necessary. (2) After delivery, the interventional radiologist quickly inflated the aortic balloon (if applicable), the first assistant lifted the uterus out of the abdominal cavity and compressed its lower segment, while the second assistant tied a catheter around the lower uterine segment for control. (3) The lead surgeon used oval forceps to clamp the uterine incision edges, moved the bladder inferiorly, injected oxytocin into the uterine body, and allowed for spontaneous placental detachment. Gentle blunt dissection was performed using vascular forceps and fingers to avoid damaging blood sinuses.

Based on the volume of bleeding, subsequent postoperative steps were executed sequentially: ligation of the ascending branch of the uterine artery, circular suturing at the cervical internal os, woven suturing of the anterior uterine wall, wave-like suturing of the posterior uterine wall, B-Lynch suturing, insertion of an intrauterine balloon, and closure of the uterine incision. All patients with PAS experiencing hemorrhage exceeding 2000 ml, where Intensive Care Unit (ICU) physicians and obstetricians jointly managed care until the patient was stable enough for transfer back to obstetrics.

### Levonorgestrel (skyla) [^113DA2Sr]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.5 Perforation

Perforation (total or partial, including penetration/embedment of Skyla in the uterine wall or cervix) may occur most often during insertion, although the perforation may not be detected until sometime later. The incidence of perforation during clinical trials was < 0.1%.

The risk of uterine perforation is increased in women who have recently given birth, and in women who are breastfeeding at the time of insertion. In a large postmarketing safety study conducted in the US, the risk of uterine perforation was highest when insertion occurred within ≤ 6 weeks postpartum, and also higher with breastfeeding at the time of insertion [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

The risk of perforation may be increased if Skyla is inserted when the uterus is fixed, retroverted or not completely involuted.

If perforation occurs, locate and remove Skyla. Surgery may be required. Delayed detection or removal of Skyla in case of perforation may result in migration outside the uterine cavity, adhesions, peritonitis, intestinal perforations, intestinal obstruction, abscesses and erosion of adjacent viscera. In addition, perforation may reduce contraceptive efficacy and result in pregnancy.

5.6 Expulsion

Partial or complete expulsion of Skyla may occur resulting in the loss of efficacy. Expulsion may be associated with symptoms of bleeding or pain, or it may be asymptomatic and go unnoticed. Skyla typically decreases menstrual bleeding over time; therefore, an increase of menstrual bleeding may be indicative of an expulsion. Consider further diagnostic imaging, such as x-ray, if expulsion is suspected based on ultrasound [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. In clinical trials, a 3-year expulsion rate of 3.2% (54 out of 1,665 subjects) was reported.

The risk of expulsion is increased with insertions immediately after delivery and appears to be increased with insertion after second-trimester abortion based on limited data. In a large postmarketing safety study conducted in the US, the risk of expulsion was lower with breastfeeding status [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Remove a partially expelled Skyla. If expulsion has occurred, a new Skyla can be inserted any time the provider can be reasonably certain the woman is not pregnant.

International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

4 RECOMMENDATIONS

FIGO and GCH call for a gradual phasing‐out, where feasible, of the use of blind intrauterine procedures for the evaluation and management of patients with suspected intrauterine pathology.

We recommend the following:
Hysteroscopy should be included in the evaluation of patients with suspected intrauterine pathologies, as it enables direct visualization of the uterine cavity allowing a more accurate diagnosis and targeted treatment.
Blind intrauterine procedures should be gradually replaced by a hysteroscopic‐guided approach, which improves diagnostic accuracy and reduces the risk of missing or misdiagnosing intrauterine pathologies.
In situations where hysteroscopy is not feasible or available, healthcare providers should consider the use of alternative imaging modalities, such as transvaginal ultrasound and saline infusion sonography, as a means of assessing the uterine cavity and guiding intrauterine procedures.

### Imaging findings of cesarean delivery complications: cesarean scar disease and much more [^113C6Cac]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Surgical trauma is an important trigger for tumor growth as well as hormonal estrogenic influence. The sub-umbilical sheath of the rectus abdominis is the most common site (Fig. 13).

Fig. 13
Desmoid tumor (white arrow) appears as homogeneously hypoechoic masses at US examination. On MR, typical signal characteristics include T1-WI and T2-WI low signal intensity and variable contrast enhancement (homogeneous in this case)

De Cian et al. also described a desmoid tumor arising in a cesarean scar during pregnancy.

Maybe due to its rarity, desmoid tumor has not been considered yet a chronic cesarean delivery complication. But radiologist must keep in mind this possible differential diagnosis for abdominal wall mass that develops during the postpartum period within 3 years after delivery.

Cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy is the implantation of the embryo in the cesarean delivery scar and it is the rarest form of ectopic pregnancy. Estimated incidence in overall cesarean delivery is 1/1800–1/2500. Any process that disrupts or scars the endometrium and myometrium can predispose to abnormal pregnancy implantation.

Complications are severe, like uterine rupture and hemorrhage; these usually occur early in the pregnancy necessitating hysterectomy and occasionally resulting in death.

Early diagnosis is crucial to preserve fertility and reduce mortality. US is always the first level technique, whereas MR plays a crucial role in difficult cases (Fig. 14).

Fig. 14
Cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy MR: T2-WI (a) show the gestational sac embedded in the myometrium of the anterior cervix–lower uterine segment (in this case antero-lateral, dashed arrow).

Lessons and Limitations

There were several limiting factors identified when carrying out this project. To access the data we relied on the coding department to have correctly identified every patient who underwent a suprapubic catheter insertion. Some patients may have been missed as a result of inaccurate coding. Although we thoroughly went through each set of notes on more than one occasion, sometimes we could not find the relevant piece of documentation. This is not to say it was never documented at all, but it does highlight the need for careful and clear documentation for procedures.

This project would be easy one to undertake at other hospitals.

When more than one structural cause is identified, such as adenomyosis and leiomyomas, interpretation of investigations can be challenging when determining the options for management. Understanding the pathogenesis of the causes of AUB will assist with the interpretation of the investigation.

5.2 Relationship between pathogenesis and clinical investigations: Structural causes of AUB

Polyps

Uterine polyps may be present in the cervical canal but are most commonly "… focal endometrial outgrowths that can occur anywhere in the uterine cavity. They contain a variable amount of glands, stroma, and blood vessels… " The size, texture, position, and number of polyps can all vary by the patient — features that may influence symptomology. Whereas the exact pathogenesis and natural history remain unclear, polyps are considered to arise from areas of epithelial and stromal overgrowth.

The macroscopic diagnosis of polyps can be made via two‐dimensional (2D) transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS), where polyps appear as hypoechogenic lesions and cystic glands may be present. Diagnostic accuracy can be increased with color Doppler, three‐dimensional (3D) technology, and especially contrast — a process called sonohysterography — where saline or gel media instilled into the endometrial cavity provides sonographic contrast. Whether with 2D or 3D sonography, this approach is very accurate in diagnosing intracavity uterine lesions such as polyps or leiomyomas (sensitivity 96.9% and 99.5%, respectively). Importantly, meta‐analysis suggests that there is no significant difference in accuracy in the identification of intracavity lesions compared with hysteroscopy as a reference standard [40]. For premenopausal women with symptomatic polyps, the risk of malignancy is approximately 1%; however, the number of participants used to delineate this value was small. AUB with polyps is seen to be a risk factor for malignancy, and therefore this warrants further investigation.

5.5 Perforation

Perforation (total or partial, including penetration/embedment of Mirena in the uterine wall or cervix) may occur most often during insertion, although the perforation may not be detected until sometime later. The incidence of perforation during clinical trials, which excluded breast-feeding women, was < 0.1%.

The risk of uterine perforation is increased in women who have recently given birth, and in women who are breastfeeding at the time of insertion. In a large postmarketing safety study conducted in the US, the risk of uterine perforation was highest when insertion occurred within ≤ 6 weeks postpartum, and also higher with breastfeeding at the time of insertion [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

The risk of perforation may be increased if Mirena is inserted when the uterus is fixed, retroverted or not completely involuted.

If perforation occurs, locate and remove Mirena. Surgery may be required. Delayed detection or removal of Mirena in case of perforation may result in migration outside the uterine cavity, adhesions, peritonitis, intestinal perforations, intestinal obstruction, abscesses and erosion of adjacent viscera. In addition, perforation may reduce contraceptive efficacy and result in pregnancy.

5.6 Expulsion

Partial or complete expulsion of Mirena may occur resulting in the loss of efficacy. Expulsion may be associated with symptoms of bleeding or pain, or it may be asymptomatic and go unnoticed. Mirena typically decreases menstrual bleeding over time; therefore, an increase of menstrual bleeding may be indicative of an expulsion. Consider further diagnostic imaging, such as x-ray, if expulsion is suspected based on ultrasound [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. In clinical trials, a 4.5% expulsion rate was reported over the 5-year study duration.

The risk of expulsion is increased with insertions immediately after delivery and appears to be increased with insertion after second-trimester abortion based on limited data. In a large postmarketing safety study conducted in the US, the risk of expulsion was lower with breastfeeding status [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Remove a partially expelled Mirena. If expulsion has occurred, a new Mirena can be inserted any time the provider can be reasonably certain the woman is not pregnant.

Measurement of lower uterine segment thickness to predict uterine rupture during

Sonographic measurement of lower uterine segment thickness has been used antenatally in women with a previous CS to predict uterine rupture during VBAC. Kok et al.conducted a meta‐analysis of 21 studies that included 2776 patients to evaluate the accuracy of antenatal sonographic measurement of lower segment thickness for the prediction of risk of uterine rupture during VBAC. They reported that a full‐thickness cutoff of 3.1–5.1 mm and a myometrial thickness cutoff of 2.1–4.0 mm provided a strong negative predictive value for the occurrence of a uterine defect during VBAC. A myometrial thickness cutoff of between 0.6 and 2.0 mm provided a strong positive predictive value for the occurrence of a defect, with sensitivity and specificity of 76% and 92%, respectively. Kement et al.reported that 82.6% of patients with dehiscence had full lower uterine segment thickness of 1–2 mm and 95.7% had full thickness of < 1 mm. A large multicenter prospective study, which included 984 women undergoing VBAC, reported that uterine scar dehiscence occurred in 5.3% of the women with a lower uterine segment thickness of 2–2.4 mm compared with 1.9% in women with a lower uterine segment thickness of ≥ 2.5 mm.

These studies provide support for the use of antenatal measurements of lower uterine segment thickness for the prediction of uterine rupture in women undergoing VBAC; however, no ideal thickness cutoff value has been defined for clinical use. Furthermore, the technical aspects of the measurements are not standardized in terms of full thickness versus myometrial thickness measurements, use of transabdominal versus transvaginal ultrasound for measurements, and measurements with a full versus empty bladder. The clinical applicability of lower uterine segment thickness measurement in counseling patients whether to attempt VBAC needs to be further assessed in prospective observational studies, using a standardized method of measurement.

A 27-year-old woman presented 6 weeks after an uncomplicated lower segment caesarean section with excessive bleeding per vagina. On examination, she had mild pallor with a pulse rate of 86 beats per minute and blood pressure of 116/80mm Hg, uterus well involuted with closed cervical os and bleeding demonstrated through the cervix. A transvaginal ultrasonography with colour Doppler revealed a normal size uterus with an empty cavity and a hypoechoic area with blood flow within it in the left side of the uterus with a prominent arterial feeder vessel. A CT angiogram confirmed the diagnosis of a 1.3×0.7 cm pseudoaneurysm of the uterine artery near the left cornua of the uterus. After failed attempts to control the bleeding with antifibrinolytics, bilateral uterine arteries were embolised using gel foam. Post procedure, bleeding resolved immediately. A follow-up transvaginal ultrasound after a year revealed no evidence of the pseudoaneurysm and her fertility was preserved.

### Mullerian anomalies: revisiting imaging and classification [^115xaeh6]. Insights Into Imaging (2025). Medium credibility.

Longitudinal vaginal septum (LVS)

General information

Failure of lateral fusion of the uterovaginal septum results in the formation of an LVS (Fig. 12.2). It is seen in uterus didelphys, bicornuate bicollis, and complete septate uterus. Uterus didelphys is the most common anomaly associated with LVS, however, in clinical practice, LVS is most commonly seen with septate uterus due to its high prevalence. LVS can be complete or partial, central or eccentric, non-obstructing or obstructing ± microperforation.

Imaging

On USG, a hypoechoic band of fibrous tissue of variable length is seen extending through the vagina. MRI shows a T2 hypointense band along the length of the vagina resulting in a double vagina. The two vaginal cavities can be either symmetrical or asymmetrical. Aqueous vaginal gel can be applied for better visualization of the cavities and septum.

Clinical importance and management

The clinical presentation depends on the status of obstruction caused by the septum. Non-obstructing types are usually asymptomatic and may present with difficulty in tampon insertion, leakage even with tampon use, or laceration during intercourse. Patients with obstructing types present with symptoms of hemivaginal obstruction and those with microperforate vaginal obstruction present with abnormal uterine bleeding. These should be differentiated from imperforate hymen, vaginismus, and vaginal adhesions. Indications for resection of the septum include dystocia and dyspareunia.

The risk of uterine perforation is increased in women who have recently given birth, and in women who are breastfeeding at the time of insertion. In a large postmarketing safety study conducted in the US, the risk of uterine perforation was highest when insertion occurred within ≤ 6 weeks postpartum, and also higher with breastfeeding at the time of insertion [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

The risk of perforation may be increased if Kyleena is inserted when the uterus is fixed, retroverted or not completely involuted.

If perforation occurs, locate and remove Kyleena. Surgery may be required. Delayed detection or removal of Kyleena in case of perforation may result in migration outside the uterine cavity, adhesions, peritonitis, intestinal perforations, intestinal obstruction, abscesses and erosion of adjacent viscera. In addition, perforation may reduce contraceptive efficacy and result in pregnancy.

5.6 Expulsion

Partial or complete expulsion of Kyleena may occur resulting in the loss of efficacy. Expulsion may be associated with symptoms of bleeding or pain, or it may be asymptomatic and go unnoticed. Kyleena typically decreases menstrual bleeding over time; therefore, an increase of menstrual bleeding may be indicative of an expulsion. Consider further diagnostic imaging, such as x-ray, if expulsion is suspected based on ultrasound [see Warnings and Precautions (5.10)]. In clinical trials, a 5-year expulsion rate of 3.5% (59 out of 1,690 subjects) was reported.

The risk of expulsion is increased with insertions immediately after delivery and appears to be increased with insertion after second-trimester abortion based on limited data. In a large postmarketing safety study conducted in the US, the risk of expulsion was lower with breastfeeding status [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

Remove a partially expelled Kyleena. If expulsion has occurred, a new Kyleena can be inserted any time the provider can be reasonably certain the woman is not pregnant.

Results

There were 98 patients with CSP (Table 1) in this study, with 49 patients in the case group and 49 patients in the control group. In the case group, 20 patients had intraoperative blood loss ≥ 200 ml, 21 patients had RPOC, and 8 patients had both. There were 21 patients with intraoperative blood loss ≥ 200 and < 400 ml, 5 patients with intraoperative blood loss ≥ 400 and < 1000 ml, and 2 patients with intraoperative blood loss of 1000 mL and 1300 ml, respectively. Ultrasound examination of the 29 patients with RPOC showed that the maximum diameter of the abnormal echogenic lesions in the incision site of the lower segment of the uterine cavity was 17–69 mm, with an average of (36.69 ± 9.58) mm. Among them, 12 patients underwent hysteroscopy or uterine curettage for a second operation to clear the RPOC, and pathological examination showed that the lesions contained villi. The remaining 17 patients with RPOC did not undergo a secondary operation, and the serum β-hCG level did not return to the normal level (0–3 IU/L) 3 weeks after the operation. Ultrasound examination 30 days after the operation showed that abnormal echogenic lesions were still visible at the incision site of the lower segment of the uterine cavity. These 17 patients with RPOC were treated with drugs, either alone or in combination, such as methotrexate, mifepristone, misoprostol, traditional Chinese medicine, etc. and abnormal echogenic lesions in the lower uterine cavity disappeared, as confirmed by ultrasonography, six months after the operation. There were no statistically significant differences in age, gestational age, crown-rump length, number of caesarean sections, number of abortions, or percentages of cases with normal heartbeat between the control and case groups (Table 2).

Step 4 – Inserting LILETTA into the Uterus

Apply gentle traction on the tenaculum and continue to apply forward pressur e on the BLUE slider while inserting the loaded insertion tube through the cervical os. Advance the tube until the upper edge of the flange is 1.5–2 cm from the external cervical os (Figure 8). Maintain forward pressure on the BLUE slider throughout the insertion process.

○ DO NOT advance flange to the cervix at this time.

○ DO NOT force the inserter. If necessary, dilate the cervical canal.

Figure 8: Advancing Insertion Tube until Flange is 1.5 to 2 cm from the External Cervix

● Using your thumb or finger, gently slide only the BLUE slider back. You will feel slight resistance initially to move the BLUE slider out of its starting position. Continue to move the BLUE slider back until you feel slight resistance again as the BLUE and GREEN sliders will merge together to form a joint slider recess. Do not move the BLUE slider any more than is necessary to create the recess. Maintain the GREEN slider so that the double line markings on the slider and the insertion handle remain aligned (Figure 9). This will allow the IUS arms to open in the lower uterine segment. Do not pull the sliders back any further as this could result in premature release of the IUS at the incorrect location.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of sonohysterography and hysterosalpingo-contrast sonography [^1167BU5U]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS) — image acquisition and evaluation recommend that precatheterization images should be obtained and recorded in accordance with the AIUM Practice Parameter for the Performance of Ultrasound of the Female Pelvis, with a recommendation to instill fluid into the endometrial cavity with real-time ultrasound ensuring adequate visualization. A complete survey of the uterine cavity should be performed with images to document normal and abnormal findings; images should include sagittal and transverse images of the endometrium, with measurement of each layer of the endometrium in the sagittal plane, and the endometrium should be evaluated for any asymmetry, irregularity, or presence of focal lesions. If an intrauterine balloon is used, additional images should be obtained at the end of the procedure with the balloon deflated to fully evaluate the endometrial cavity, particularly the cervical canal and lower portion, including a cesarean scar niche if present. The location of focal lesions should be demonstrated in sagittal and transverse planes or with 3-dimensional imaging; the size, sonographic characteristics, and depth of penetration into the myometrium in the case of submucous myomas should be documented. Color Doppler or power Doppler imaging may be helpful in evaluating the vascularity of an intrauterine abnormality, and three-dimensional imaging may be helpful; specifically, reconstructed coronal plane imaging is also useful in the assessment of Müllerian duct anomalies and for preoperative mapping of myomas.

### Successful pregnancy and term delivery after treatment of unicornuate uterus with non-communicating rudimentary horn pregnancy with local methotrexate injection followed by laparoscopic resection: a case report and literature review [^115XoyfH]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2021). Medium credibility.

After MTX treatment, the pregnancy site was closely observed by transvaginal ultrasound, and serum hCG levels were closely measured. A transient hCG elevation was observed after MTX treatment, but the hCG level subsequently decreased; on postoperative day 30, the hCG level dropped to 1587 mIU/ml (Fig. 3). Color Doppler showed that the blood flow signals from around the gestational sac in the right rudimentary horn were clearly decreased compared to those before the treatment.

Laparoscopic resection of the right rudimentary horn 48 days after the MTX treatment was performed. We created a 12-mm trocar port in the umbilicus for 10 mm straight optics, and three 5-mm trocar ports in the lower abdomen for laparoscopic trocar port placement. Observation of the abdominal cavity revealed no ascites, bleeding, or adhesions. The right pregnant rudimentary horn was enlarged and more than twice the size of the left unicornuate uterus (Fig. 4 a). The attachment between the right rudimentary horn and the left unicornuate uterus was several centimeters in size (Fig. 4 b). A 21-gauge needle was inserted through the abdominal wall into the site of the right rudimentary horn directly, and diluted Pitressin (0.1 U/ml, 20 units diluted in 200 mL saline) was injected to decrease the bleeding. An ultrasonic scalpel (Harmonic Ace, Ethicon, Tokyo, Japan) was placed inside the pregnant right uterine wall, exposing and enucleating the gestational sac portion, with minimal bleeding (Fig. 4 c). The rudimentary horn and right fallopian tube were resected from the site of attachment to the left uterus. After resecting the right rudimentary horn, a balloon catheter was placed in the left uterine lumen. An indigo carmine solution was injected to confirm communication with the right rudimentary horn. Although leakage of the indigo carmine solution was observed into the muscular layer of the resected uterus, when we attempted to insert a sonde through the indigo carmine seepage site, we could not find an obvious communicating channel to the left uterus (Fig. 4 d). The resection site was Z-sutured using biodegradable poly-p-dioxanone (PDS-II, Ethicon, Johnson and Johnson, Tokyo, Japan). A peritoneal endometriosis lesion was electrocauterized, and a submucosal myoma was enucleated. Finally, the surgery was completed with the application of a regenerated cellulose adhesion barrier (Interceed, Ethicon, Johnson and Johnson, Tokyo, Japan) to cover the right rudimentary horn resection site. The operative time was 123 min, and the amount of blood loss was 15 ml. Histopathological findings revealed degenerated chorionic and decidual tissues in the excised gestational sac.

### Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine consult series # 63: cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy [^113hie7X]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2022). High credibility.

Cesarean scar ectopic pregnancy — diagnostic pitfalls and confirmation: Bulging or ballooning of the lower uterine segment in the midline sagittal transabdominal view has been considered supportive of CSEP. Especially with very early diagnosis and before fetal cardiac activity, the patient should have confirmation of pregnancy (for example, a positive pregnancy test result). In a literature review that collected 751 cases of CSEP, 107 (13.6%) were originally misdiagnosed as cervical ectopic pregnancies, spontaneous abortions in transit, or low implantation of an intrauterine pregnancy. Given the importance of prompt diagnosis, referral to an experienced center for a second opinion may be preferable to ongoing follow-up examinations that are likely to delay diagnosis.

### Lower uterine segment thickness to prevent uterine rupture and adverse perinatal outcomes: a multicenter prospective study [^117KpSmg]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Choice of delivery route after previous cesarean delivery can be difficult because both trial of labor after cesarean delivery and elective repeat cesarean delivery are associated with risks. The major risk that is associated with trial of labor after cesarean delivery is uterine rupture that requires emergency laparotomy.

Objective

This study aimed to estimate the occurrence of uterine rupture during trial of labor after cesarean delivery when lower uterine segment thickness measurement is included in the decision-making process about the route of delivery.

Study Design

In 4 tertiary-care centers, we prospectively recruited women between 34 and 38 weeks of gestation who were contemplating a vaginal birth after a previous single low-transverse cesarean delivery. Lower uterine segment thickness was measured by ultrasound imaging and integrated in the decision of delivery route. According to lower uterine segment thickness, women were classified in 3 risk categories for uterine rupture: high risk (< 2.0 mm), intermediate risk (2.0–2.4 mm), and low risk (≥ 2.5 mm). Our primary outcome was symptomatic uterine rupture, which was defined as requiring urgent laparotomy. We calculated that 942 women who were undergoing a trial of labor after cesarean delivery should be included to be able to show a risk of uterine rupture < 0.8%.

Results

We recruited 1856 women, of whom 1849 (99%) had a complete follow-up data. Lower uterine segment thickness was < 2.0 mm in 194 women (11%), 2.0–2.4 mm in 217 women (12%), and ≥ 2.5 mm in 1438 women (78%). Rate of trial of labor was 9%, 42%, and 61% in the 3 categories, respectively (P < .0001). Of 984 trials of labor, there were no symptomatic uterine ruptures, which is a rate that was lower than the 0.8% expected rate (P = .0001).

Conclusion

The inclusion of lower uterine segment thickness measurement in the decision of the route of delivery allows a low risk of uterine rupture during trial of labor after cesarean delivery.

### AAGL practice report: morcellation during uterine tissue extraction [^111yfDcE]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2014). Medium credibility.

AAGL practice report — imaging evaluation for suspected uterine sarcoma notes that pelvic ultrasonography and sonohysterography "represent the mainstay of imaging for endometrial pathology, but these modalities are not infallible". In women with postmenopausal bleeding, "an endometrial echo of > 4mm indicates possible intrauterine pathology", although "there is no evidence this applies to asymptomatic postmenopausal women with a thickened endometrial echo". Ultrasound may show "mixed or poor echogenic areas with central necrosis" and Doppler can reveal "irregular vessel distribution, low impedance of flow, and high peak systolic velocity"; if sarcoma is suspected after ultrasound, "magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be helpful in further evaluation", but MRI features that suggest LMS "can also be consistent with benign degenerating uterine myomas", and "Significant change in size between interval scans, in addition to these features, should raise concern".
