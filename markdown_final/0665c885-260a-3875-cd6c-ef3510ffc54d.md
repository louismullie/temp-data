## Question

54 yo F with recently diagnosed hyperthyroidism (palpitations, weight loss, goiter); PMH: rheumatoid arthritis (on weekly methotrexate and folic acid), mild chronic asthma. She develops new-onset atrial fibrillation (heart rate 118, BP 124/76, SpO₂ 97%). Started on oral amiodarone 400 mg TID for rhythm control. Four days later, significant LFT elevation and mild shortness of breath are noted. The team considers treating her mild transaminitis with a short prednisone course (40 mg/day × 5 days) to "calm her liver inflammation". Safe to start prednisone?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether a short prednisone course is safe and appropriate to treat amiodarone-associated transaminitis in a 54-year-old woman with new-onset atrial fibrillation and recently diagnosed hyperthyroidism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the likely etiologies of the liver test abnormalities and whether steroids would address them. Then, I should verify what major guidelines say about steroid use in amiodarone-induced thyroid disease and whether that applies to hepatotoxicity. Next, I will review the FDA labeling and contemporary AF guidelines for managing amiodarone hepatotoxicity. Finally, I will weigh risks and benefits, including infection, glycemic effects, and drug interactions, and outline a safer, evidence-based plan with monitoring and alternatives if amiodarone must be stopped.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the timing. She started amiodarone four days ago and now has significant LFT elevations with mild dyspnea; this timeline makes isolated, severe amiodarone hepatotoxicity less likely than early, often transient transaminitis, though I should not jump to conclusions and must keep both possibilities in mind [^e37c924e]. I need to check whether the dyspnea raises concern for pulmonary toxicity, which can present subtly and carries high mortality; baseline chest radiography and symptom surveillance are recommended in labeling and guidelines, and new dyspnea warrants evaluation rather than empiric steroids for the liver alone [^e37c924e] [^ecbe5a3f].

> Now, I should verify the indication for steroids in amiodarone-related disease. Wait, let me verify the guideline scope: both the ATA and ETA recommend corticosteroids for amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis, particularly type 2 destructive thyroiditis, not for amiodarone hepatotoxicity; there is no endorsement of steroids for drug-induced liver injury from amiodarone in these guidelines, and subtype-directed therapy with antithyroid drugs versus steroids pertains to thyroid disease, not liver injury [^b059b48a] [^fbc3a5ae] [^1770d42d]. Hold on, I should verify whether any expert reviews conflate these; I do not see credible sources recommending steroids for amiodarone liver injury, reinforcing that the indication is absent here.

> Next, I should review what the FDA labeling says about hepatotoxicity and how to manage it. The label advises obtaining baseline and periodic liver enzymes, and if transaminases exceed three times the upper limit of normal or double in a patient with an elevated baseline, the recommendation is to discontinue or reduce the dose of amiodarone and treat appropriately; it does not recommend corticosteroids for hepatic injury, and it emphasizes that adverse effects can persist for weeks after stopping due to the long half-life [^e37c924e] [^1b4962e6]. I should double-check that no subgroup or exception is made for short steroid bursts; I find none, which supports avoiding steroids for this indication [^e37c924e].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology to ensure I'm not missing a steroid-responsive mechanism. Amiodarone hepatotoxicity includes idiosyncratic injury and, more commonly, a dose- and duration-related phospholipidosis with mitochondrial injury; this is mechanistically distinct from immune-mediated thyroiditis, and there is no evidence that glucocorticoids reverse amiodarone-related hepatocellular injury or cholestasis, whereas steroids are used for amiodarone pulmonary toxicity, which is a different organ system and pathobiology [^e37c924e] [^82c8ef60]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; even though steroids can be used for pulmonary toxicity, that does not translate to liver injury, so extrapolating would be inappropriate here [^e37c924e].

> Let me consider the risk-benefit of a 5-day prednisone burst. Short-course steroids can worsen glycemic control, increase infection risk, and interact with methotrexate, which she takes for RA; in a patient with new AF and possible thyrotoxicosis, adding systemic steroids without a clear indication could obscure clinical assessment and expose her to harm without proven benefit for the liver injury, so I should be cautious and avoid empiric steroids [^notfound]. I should confirm that no trials show improved liver outcomes with steroids in this setting; indeed, there are none, whereas observational data in AIT show prednisone did not shorten time to euthyroidism and was associated with worse outcomes, underscoring that steroids are not benign in amiodarone-related disease contexts [^b0d12d3e].

> Next, I should review the correct management steps. First, I need to ensure we quantify the LFT elevation and compare to baseline; if ALT/AST are more than three times the upper limit of normal or have doubled from an elevated baseline, the labeled action is to discontinue or reduce amiodarone and obtain follow-up labs, while evaluating for alternative causes of liver injury and monitoring closely [^e37c924e] [^1b4962e6]. Second, I should confirm thyroid status and subtype of thyrotoxicosis because this affects arrhythmia management and the need for antithyroid therapy or steroids for the thyroid disease itself, not the liver [^b059b48a] [^1770d42d]. Third, I need to check for pulmonary toxicity given the new dyspnea with a chest radiograph and symptom review, reserving CT if abnormalities or symptoms persist, and I should correct electrolytes and consider rate control while the thyroid workup proceeds [^e37c924e] [^ecbe5a3f].

> But wait, what if the arrhythmia absolutely requires amiodarone and no alternatives exist? I should confirm with cardiology whether continuation is necessary despite hepatotoxicity; if so, the balance may favor cautious continuation with dose reduction and intensified liver monitoring, recognizing that persistent transaminitis warrants stopping the drug and that no evidence supports steroids to mitigate liver injury in this scenario [^e37c924e] [^1b4962e6]. If amiodarone is stopped, I need to remember its long half-life and that adverse effects can persist for weeks, so monitoring must continue even after cessation [^e37c924e].

> In summary, I should conclude clearly: No, it is not safe or indicated to start prednisone for amiodarone-associated transaminitis; there is no evidence that steroids improve liver outcomes in this setting, guidelines do not recommend steroids for amiodarone hepatotoxicity, and the FDA labeling directs dose reduction or discontinuation with supportive care rather than corticosteroids, so a short prednisone course risks harm without benefit here [^e37c924e] [^b059b48a] [^1770d42d]. The appropriate action is to reassess liver enzymes against baseline, reduce or stop amiodarone if thresholds are met, evaluate for other causes of liver injury, and manage the thyrotoxicosis and atrial fibrillation per endocrine and cardiology guidance, reserving steroids only for confirmed type 2 amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis if clinically indicated [^e37c924e] [^b059b48a] [^1770d42d].

It is **not safe** to give prednisone 40 mg/day for 5 days to treat mild transaminitis from amiodarone. Prednisone is **not indicated** for amiodarone hepatotoxicity and may worsen liver injury or mask progression. The correct approach is to **stop or reduce amiodarone** and monitor LFTs; if transaminases exceed 3× ULN or double from baseline, discontinue amiodarone and evaluate for other causes. Prednisone is reserved for amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (type 2) or pulmonary toxicity, not liver injury. Short-course prednisone also carries risks (infection, hyperglycemia, immunosuppression) and may interact with methotrexate, so it should be avoided here.

---

## Pathophysiology of amiodarone-induced hepatotoxicity

Amiodarone hepatotoxicity presents as **asymptomatic transaminase elevations** in 15–30% of patients, with clinically significant hepatitis or cirrhosis in < 3% [^bc37a3a3]. Mechanisms include direct hepatocyte injury, mitochondrial dysfunction, and phospholipid accumulation, which can progress to steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines and expert consensus **do not recommend corticosteroids** for amiodarone-induced hepatotoxicity. Instead, they advise:

- **Discontinuation or dose reduction**: Stop or reduce amiodarone if transaminases exceed 3× ULN or double from baseline [^e37c924e] [^1b4962e6].
- **Monitoring**: Obtain baseline and periodic liver function tests during therapy [^ecbe5a3f].
- **Supportive care**: No role for corticosteroids in managing liver injury [^notfound].

---

## Risks associated with corticosteroid use in this patient

Prednisone 40 mg/day for 5 days carries **meaningful risks**, particularly in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate:

- **Immunosuppression**: Increased infection risk, including opportunistic infections.
- **Hyperglycemia**: Worsening glycemic control, especially in patients with diabetes or prediabetes.
- **Drug interactions**: Methotrexate toxicity may be potentiated by corticosteroids, increasing risk of hepatotoxicity, bone marrow suppression, and mucositis.
- **Masking of symptoms**: Steroids may obscure progression of liver injury or other adverse effects.

---

## Evidence regarding corticosteroids in amiodarone-induced hepatotoxicity

There is **no evidence** supporting corticosteroids for amiodarone-induced liver injury. Their use is reserved for amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (type 2) or pulmonary toxicity, not hepatotoxicity [^b059b48a] [^e37c924e].

---

## Alternative management strategies

Recommended management of **mild transaminitis** from amiodarone includes:

- **Immediate action**: Stop or reduce amiodarone if transaminases exceed 3× ULN or double from baseline [^e37c924e] [^1b4962e6].
- **Monitoring**: Recheck LFTs every 1–2 weeks until normalization or stabilization.
- **Evaluation**: Assess for other causes of liver injury (e.g. viral hepatitis, alcohol, other medications).
- **Supportive care**: Consider hepatoprotective agents (e.g. ursodeoxycholic acid) in select cases, though evidence is limited.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

Prednisone is **not indicated** for amiodarone-induced transaminitis and may cause harm. The appropriate action is to stop or reduce amiodarone and monitor LFTs, reserving steroids for confirmed type 2 amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis or pulmonary toxicity.

Overt drug-induced thyrotoxicosis management — beta-adrenergic blocking agents alone or in combination with methimazole should be used to treat overt iodine-induced hyperthyroidism. Patients who develop thyrotoxicosis during therapy with interferon-α or interleukin-2 should be evaluated to determine etiology (thyroiditis vs. GD) and treated accordingly. We suggest monitoring thyroid function tests before and at 1 and 3 months following the initiation of amiodarone therapy, and at 3–6-month intervals thereafter, and we suggest testing to distinguish type 1 (iodine-induced) from type 2 (thyroiditis) varieties of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. The decision to stop amiodarone in the setting of thyrotoxicosis should be determined on an individual basis in consultation with a cardiologist, based on the presence or absence of effective alternative antiarrhythmic therapy. Methimazole should be used to treat type 1 amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis and corticosteroids should be used to treat type 2 amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis, and combined antithyroid drug and anti-inflammatory therapy should be used to treat patients with overt amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis who fail to respond to single modality therapy, and patients in whom the type of disease cannot be unequivocally determined.

### Hyperthyroidism… [^ae1b586b]. JAMA Network (2011). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. The thyroid gland is located at the base of the neck, in front of the trachea and esophagus. The thyroid produces thyroid hormone, which helps regulate many body functions. In hyperthyroidism, the thyroid is overactive and produces more thyroid hormone than the body needs. Women are more likely than men to have hyperthyroidism, and it affects younger persons more than elderly persons. This Patient Page is based on one published in the July 6, 2005, issue of JAMA. Causes More than 70% of cases of hyperthyroidism are related to Graves disease, an autoimmune disorder in which the body produces antibodies to its own tissues. These antibodies cause the thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone.

Some persons with Graves disease develop an eye condition called exophthalmos, in which the eyes begin to protrude because of swelling of tissues behind the eye. Smoking cigarettes greatly increases the risk of a more severe eye problem among persons with Graves disease. Other medical problems that can cause hyperthyroidism are toxic nodular goiter, subacute thyroiditis, exposure to iodine in medications or x-ray dyes, and postpartum thyroiditis. Symptoms Weight loss without eating less or exercising more Palpitations or abnormal heart rhythms Heat intolerance and sweating Nervousness Tremors Eyes that appear to protrude Symptoms may be less severe or even absent in older persons with hyperthyroidism.

Diagnosis Your medical history and a physical examination may indicate the possibility of hyperthyroidism. Simple blood tests show the presence of too much thyroid hormone as well as an abnormally low level of the hormone called TSH. A thyroid scan may be performed using an injection or pill containing a small amount of radioactive material. This test looks for areas of abnormal function within the thyroid gland. Treatment Treatment of hyperthyroidism depends on the cause. Graves disease may be treated with medications known as antithyroid drugs, radioactive iodine, or surgery to remove the thyroid gland.

### Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis: clinical course and predictors of outcome [^b0d12d3e]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study sought to determine the clinical course and predictors of long-term outcome in patients with documented amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT).

Background

Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis is a condition that is difficult to manage, in particular because of the long half-life of amiodarone. Data on optimal treatment for AIT are scarce.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review among patients with documented AIT at a tertiary care center. Baseline characteristics, treatment received, laboratory parameters, and events during follow-up were evaluated. The predefined composite end point consisted of the following AIT-associated complications: death, heart transplantation, hospitalization for heart failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for arrhythmia management, or hospitalization for treatment complications.

Results

Eighty-four patients were included in the present analysis; 27 patients received prednisone for AIT. There was no difference in time to normalization of free thyroxine between those receiving and those not receiving prednisone. Long-term follow-up showed high morbidity and mortality; 47 patients (56%) reached the primary end point. Patients receiving prednisone had a worse outcome than those not receiving prednisone (p = 0.003). Although patients received prednisone for 84 ± 65 days, curves started to separate only 12 months after the initial diagnosis.

Conclusions

Patients with AIT have a high event rate during follow-up. Prednisone had no effect on time to normalization of thyroxine levels and was associated with an increased event rate. Importantly, AIT-related problems must be expected late, at a time when thyroid function is under control.

### Hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis: management guidelines of the American Thyroid Association and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [^e6e2bb48]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Medium credibility.

Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis — decision to stop amiodarone should be individualized: the decision to stop amiodarone in thyrotoxicosis should be made with a cardiologist based on whether effective alternative antiarrhythmic therapy is available (RECOMMENDATION 92, 1/+00). Discontinuation is controversial because drug effects may persist for many months and withdrawal may aggravate cardiac thyrotoxic manifestations; type 2 AIT typically resolves even if amiodarone is continued.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^928e5eb6]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis — initial combined therapy considerations and methimazole (MMI) dosing: Individuals with moderate thyrotoxicosis and compromised cardiac status should be considered for initial combined therapy rather than sequential empiric therapy; some centers recommend starting combined therapy with ATDs and corticosteroids at the time of initial AIT diagnosis, and between 16% and 25% of surveyed thyroidologists prefer combination ATD and corticosteroid therapy for apparent type 2 AIT. Technical remarks specify a suggested starting dose of MMI of 40 mg once daily until euthyroid (generally 3–6 months), and if high doses of MMI continue to be required, splitting the dose may be more effective.

### Prescribing amiodarone: an evidence-based review of clinical indications [^bc37a3a3]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

Context

Although amiodarone is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration only for refractory ventricular arrhythmias, it is one of the most frequently prescribed antiarrhythmic medications in the United States.

Objective

To evaluate and synthesize evidence regarding optimal use of amiodarone for various arrhythmias.

Evidence Acquisition

Systematic search of MEDLINE to identify peer-reviewed clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, and other studies with clinical pertinence. The search was limited to human-participant, English-language reports published between 1970 and 2007. Amiodarone was searched using the terms adverse effects, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, congestive heart failure, electrical storm, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, surgery, ventricular arrhythmia, ventricular fibrillation, and Wolff-Parkinson-White. Bibliographies of identified articles and guidelines from official societies were reviewed for additional references. Ninety-two identified studies met inclusion criteria and were included in the review.

Evidence Synthesis

Amiodarone may have clinical value in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure as first-line treatment for atrial fibrillation, though other agents are available. Amiodarone is useful in acute management of sustained ventricular tachyarrythmias, regardless of hemodynamic stability. The only role for prophylactic amiodarone is in the perioperative period of cardiac surgery. Amiodarone may be effective as an adjunct to implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy to reduce number of shocks. However, amiodarone has a number of serious adverse effects, including corneal microdeposits (> 90%), optic neuropathy/neuritis (≤ 1%-2%), blue-gray skin discoloration (4%-9%), photosensitivity (25%-75%), hypothyroidism (6%), hyperthyroidism (0.9%-2%), pulmonary toxicity (1%-17%), peripheral neuropathy (0.3% annually), and hepatotoxicity (elevated enzyme levels, 15%-30%; hepatitis and cirrhosis, < 3% [0.6% annually]).

Conclusion

Amiodarone should be used with close follow-up in patients who are likely to derive the most benefit, namely those with atrial fibrillation and left ventricular dysfunction, those with acute sustained ventricular arrhythmias, those about to undergo cardiac surgery, and those with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators and symptomatic shocks.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^9aeef6ab]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) — for patients unresponsive to aggressive medical therapy with MMI and corticosteroids, patients should undergo thyroidectomy (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). Patients who fail to respond to medical therapy should be offered thyroidectomy before they become excessively debilitated, and delay or deferral of surgery imparts an even higher risk of death. Thyroidectomy done under regional anesthesia when available may be preferred for very ill patients. In patients in whom amiodarone was stopped during an episode of AIT, definitive therapy with RAI or surgery should be considered to facilitate reintroduction of amiodarone without concerns about recurrent AIT.

### Amiodarone: guidelines for use and monitoring [^1117aa44]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is a potent antiarrhythmic agent that is used to treat ventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation. The drug prevents the recurrence of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and produces a modest reduction of sudden deaths in high-risk patients. Amiodarone is more effective than sotalol or propafenone in preventing recurrent atrial fibrillation in patients for whom a rhythm-control strategy is chosen. When long-term amiodarone therapy is used, potential drug toxicity and interactions must be considered. The dosage of amiodarone should be kept at the lowest effective level. In patients who also are taking digoxin and warfarin, physicians must pay close attention to digoxin levels and prothrombin time, keeping in mind that the effects of interaction with amiodarone do not peak until seven weeks after the initiation of concomitant therapy. Laboratory studies to assess liver and thyroid function should be performed at least every six months.

### Amiodarone-induced type 2 thyrotoxicosis [^66f74273]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

The authors present a case of a 55-year-old gentleman with a medical history of atrial fibrillation on amiodarone who presented with weight loss, palpitations and exertional dyspnoea. Thyroid function tests revealed thyrotoxicosis with a free thyroxine (T4) of 117pmol/L and a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) of < 0.008mIU/L. Interleukin-6 level was low. The negative TSH-receptor antibody status, the presence of a small thyroid gland with heterogeneous echotexture and decreased internal vascularity on ultrasound together with the relatively quick drop in free T4 and free tri-iodothyronine (T3) levels once prednisolone therapy was added to carbimazole suggested that this was typical of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) type 2. Subsequently, carbimazole was discontinued and treatment with prednisolone was continued. This case highlights that AIT management may be challenging and it is of paramount importance to establish the type of AIT present as this will guide management and is key to improving prognosis.

### Thyroiditis: evaluation and treatment… [^5194736d]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION Patients with HT often present with a painless goiter, with or without overt hypothyroidism. 1 In patients who are asymptomatic, HT is usually the incidental finding of the goiter that prompted an evaluation. Other patients may report typical symptoms of hypothyroidism such as fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, constipation, depression, myalgia, menorrhagia, and dry skin. Many of these symptoms overlap with other disorders and may not always correlate with the degree of thyroid dysfunction. In a 20-year follow-up study, clinical or biochemical hypothyroidism developed in 55% of the women who initially had positive thyroid antibodies and an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone level but a normal serum free thyroxine level.
15. 4 and free triiodothyronine) or overt hypothyroidism, and elevated thyroglobulin and thyroid peroxidase antibodies.

1, 15 TPO antibodies are found in 95% of patients with HT, whereas thyroglobulin antibodies are elevated in 60% to 80% of patients with HT. 1 Some patients may present with self-limited transient thyrotoxicosis or a hyperthyroid phase caused by destructive inflammation attributed to HT damaging the thyroid follicles, releasing excess thyroid hormone. 18 The thyroid gland is often diffusely enlarged and firm with an irregular surface on examination. 15 Some patients have a small thyroid volume if underlying atrophy of the thyroid gland has occurred. 2 Patients with goiter may have compressive symptoms such as dysphonia, dyspnea, and dysphagia.

1. TREATMENT All patients with HT and hypothyroidism require treatment, even if they are asymptomatic. The goals of treatment include normalizing the TSH level and ameliorating symptoms of hypothyroidism.

When deciding on the initial replacement dose of levothyroxine, the patient's age and cardiac status should be considered. A healthy, young patient without coexisting heart disease can be started on a full replacement dosage of levothyroxine. A lower dosage of levothyroxine is appropriate in older adults, patients with underlying coronary heart disease, and those with tachyarrhythmias such as atrial fibrillation. Treatment with T. 3 is not routinely recommended. The patient's TSH level should be remeasured four to six weeks after initiation and the dose of levothyroxine adjusted to achieve a value in the normal reference range. Clinicians may try to achieve slightly higher TSH levels in older patients. It is reasonable to make dosage adjustments of 12. 5 to 25 mcg of levothyroxine per day at four- to six-week intervals until the intended TSH level is reached.

In patients with subclinical hypothyroidism and elevated TPO antibodies, especially those with a serum TSH level of at least 10 mIU per L or with symptoms, treatment with low-dose levothyroxine should be considered. An initial dosage of 25 to 50 mcg per day can be established and titrated in these patients similarly to patients who have overt hypothyroidism. If therapy with levothyroxine is not initiated, patients should be monitored annually for the development of overt hypothyroidism. 15, 19. 7 Measurement of thyroid antibodies can help distinguish between postpartum thyroiditis and Graves disease. The presence of thyrotropin receptor antibodies usually indicates Graves disease. Elevated TPO and thyroglobulin antibodies are often found in patients with postpartum thyroiditis, and mildly positive thyrotropin receptor antibodies have also been reported.

### Diagnosis and clinical course of three adolescents with amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism [^472e571d]. Pediatric Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

Amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism is a known side effect of amiodarone treatment. In the pediatric population, long-term amiodarone treatment is rarely indicated because of its severe side effects including thyroid function impairment. Treatment is therefore restricted to therapy-resistant arrhythmias. In the literature, scarce data are available on the management and therapy of amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction at a young age. We present three adolescent patients developing amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis in the months after amiodarone therapy. A latency period for thyroid dysfunction has been described in adulthood but was not previously reported in pediatric patients. The gap between amiodarone treatment and the development of symptoms and the diagnosis of hyperthyroidism was between 3 and 10 months. In two patients, hyperthyroidism was transient and resolved without treatment. These two patients, one boy and on girl, were almost asymptomatic. In contrast, in one male patient overt and severe hyperthyroidism developed. We began treatment with thiamazole without benefit. Control of hyperthyroidism was achieved under prednisone treatment, which was continued for 9 months. Clinical evaluation proved an amiodarone-induced destructive thyroiditis in this patient. Amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction is frequent also in pediatric patients with long-term amiodarone treatment. Patients and clinicians should be aware of the impact of amiodarone on thyroid function during and also in the months and maybe years after treatment. Careful follow-up is needed, as symptoms might be associated with the underlying cardiac disease in these patients. Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis often resolves without treatment but can be challenging in some cases.

### Amiodarone hydrochloride [^ce85d81e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.6 Thyroid Abnormalities

Amiodarone hydrochloride inhibits peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3) and may cause increased thyroxine levels, decreased T3levels, and increased levels of inactive reverse T3(rT3) in clinically euthyroid patients. Amiodarone hydrochloride can cause either hypothyroidism (reported in up to 10% of patients) or hyperthyroidism (occurring in about 2% of patients). Monitor thyroid function prior to treatment and periodically thereafter, particularly in elderly patients, and in any patient with a history of thyroid nodules, goiter, or other thyroid dysfunction.

Hyperthyroidism may induce arrhythmia breakthrough. If any new signs of arrhythmia appear, the possibility of hyperthyroidism should be considered. Antithyroid drugs, β-adrenergic blockers, temporary corticosteroid therapy may be necessary to treat the symptoms of hyperthyroidism. The action of antithyroid drugs may be delayed in amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis because of substantial quantities of preformed thyroid hormones stored in the gland. Radioactive iodine therapy is contraindicated because of the low radioiodine uptake associated with amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. Amiodarone hydrochloride-induced hyperthyroidism may be followed by a transient period of hypothyroidism.

Hypothyroidism may be primary or subsequent to resolution of preceding amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. Severe hypothyroidism and myxedema coma, sometimes fatal, have been reported in association with amiodarone therapy. In some clinically hypothyroid amiodarone-treated patients, free thyroxine index values may be normal. Manage hypothyroidism by reducing the dose of or discontinuing amiodarone hydrochloride and thyroid hormone supplementation.

5.7 Bradycardia

Amiodarone hydrochloride causes symptomatic bradycardia or sinus arrest with suppression of escape foci in 2 to 4% of patients. The risk is increased by electrolytic disorders or use of concomitant antiarrhythmics or negative chronotropes [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Bradycardia may require a pacemaker for rate control.

Postmarketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia, some requiring pacemaker insertion and at least one fatal, have been reported when ledipasvir/sofosbuvir or sofosbuvir with simeprevir were initiated in patients on amiodarone. Bradycardia generally occurred within hours to days, but in some cases presented up to 2 weeks after initiating antiviral treatment. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of antiviral treatment. The mechanism for this effect is unknown. Monitor heart rate in patients taking or recently discontinuing amiodarone when starting antiviral treatment [see Drug Interactions (7)].

Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) — type-specific medical therapy includes MMI 40 mg daily for type 1 AIT, with rare addition of potassium perchlorate 250 mg four times daily, and prednisone 40 mg daily for type 2 AIT with improvement occasionally as early as 1 week. In one study of 20 AIT patients treated with perchlorate for 1 month, euthyroidism occurred in 12 patients (7 with type 1 AIT and 5 with type 2 AIT), and the eight nonresponders achieved euthyroidism after corticosteroids after an average of approximately 6 weeks. When type cannot be clearly distinguished, a combination of prednisone and methimazole should be used until stabilization, after which drugs may be individually tapered. Technical dosing remarks specify MMI 40 mg once daily until euthyroid (generally 3–6 months) and corticosteroids equivalent to prednisone 40 mg once daily for 2–4 weeks followed by a gradual taper over 2–3 months.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^cac34e0b]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Amiodarone — thyroid, hepatic, pulmonary, ocular, neurologic, and proarrhythmic safety are characterized as follows: Amiodarone contains 37% iodine by weight and is associated with thyroid abnormalities in 2% to 24% of patients, with median time to amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism of 183 days and hyperthyroidism of 720 days. Amiodarone may cause pulmonary toxicity, most commonly interstitial lung disease or hypersensitivity syndrome, in 1% to 2% of patients and is fatal in approximately 10% of cases; a chest x-ray is recommended at baseline and when there is clinical suspicion for pulmonary toxicity, and a chest CT scan can be helpful for diagnosis in patients with unexplained cough and dyspnea. Corneal microdeposits are common but visual abnormalities and light sensitivity are rare, and an ophthalmologic examination is reasonable only if visual abnormalities develop. Amiodarone has been associated with neurological toxicity, particularly peripheral neuropathy, and oral amiodarone may cause torsades de pointes with one analysis estimating the incidence to be 0.7%.

### Amiodarone hci [^4f6854f9]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Hyperthyroidism occurs in about 2% of patients receiving amiodarone, but the incidence may be higher among patients with prior inadequate dietary iodine intake. Amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism usually poses a greater hazard to the patient than hypothyroidism because of the possibility of thyrotoxicosis and/or arrhythmia breakthrough or aggravation, all of which may result in death. There have been reports of death associated with amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. IF ANY NEW SIGNS OF ARRHYTHMIA APPEAR, THE POSSIBILITY OF HYPERTHYROIDISM SHOULD BE CONSIDERED.

Hyperthyroidism is best identified by relevant clinical symptoms and signs, accompanied usually by abnormally elevated levels of serum T 3 RIA, and further elevations of serum T 4, and a subnormal serum TSH level (using a sufficiently sensitive TSH assay). The finding of a flat TSH response to TRH is confirmatory of hyperthyroidism and may be sought in equivocal cases. Since arrhythmia breakthroughs may accompany amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism, aggressive medical treatment is indicated, including, if possible, dose reduction or withdrawal of amiodarone.

The institution of antithyroid drugs, β-adrenergic blockers and/or temporary corticosteroid therapy may be necessary. The action of antithyroid drugs may be especially delayed in amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis because of substantial quantities of preformed thyroid hormones stored in the gland. There have been reports of death associated with amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis. Radioactive iodine therapy is contraindicated because of the low radioiodine uptake associated with amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. Amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism may be followed by a transient period of hypothyroidism (see WARNINGS, Thyrotoxicosis).

### Amiodarone hydrochloride (Pacerone) [^1b4962e6]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Persistence of Adverse Effects

Because of the long half-life of amiodarone (15 to 142 days) and its active metabolite desethylamiodarone (14 to 75 days), adverse reactions and drug interactions can persist for several weeks following amiodarone discontinuation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

5.2 Pulmonary Toxicity

Pacerone may cause a clinical syndrome of cough and progressive dyspnea accompanied by functional, radiographic, gallium-scan, and pathological data consistent with pulmonary toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity secondary to Pacerone may result from either indirect or direct toxicity as represented by hypersensitivity pneumonitis (including eosinophilic pneumonia) or interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis, respectively. Rates of pulmonary toxicity have been reported to be as high as 17% and is fatal in about 10% of cases. Obtain a baseline chest X-ray and pulmonary-function tests, including diffusion capacity, when Pacerone therapy is initiated. Repeat history, physical exam, and chest X-ray every 3 to 6 months or if symptoms occur. Consider alternative antiarrhythmic therapy if the patient experiences signs or symptoms of pulmonary toxicity. Prednisone 40 to 60 mg/day tapered over several weeks may be helpful in treating pulmonary toxicity.

Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)

Postoperatively, occurrences of ARDS have been reported in patients receiving amiodarone hydrochloride therapy who have undergone either cardiac or noncardiac surgery. Although patients usually respond well to vigorous respiratory therapy, in rare instances the outcome has been fatal.

5.3 Hepatic Injury

Asymptomatic elevations of hepatic enzyme levels are seen frequently, but Pacerone can cause life-threatening hepatic injury. Histology has resembled that of alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis. Obtain baseline and periodic liver transaminases. If transaminases exceed three times normal, or doubles in a patient with an elevated baseline, discontinue or reduce dose of Pacerone, obtain follow-up tests and treat appropriately.

### Variable use of amiodarone is associated with a greater risk of recurrence of atrial fibrillation in the critically ill [^88c40261]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

A wide range of dosing regimens are used for treating AF (3–7.5 mg/kg bolus and follow on infusions of 1200–1500 mg/24 hours or 10 mg/kg/24 hours). This lack of consensus on the best dosing regimen was reflected in our results. There was no uniform dosing strategy used and 35% of patients did not receive a loading dose. Patients receiving an amiodarone bolus typically received an "ampoule" of 300 mg regardless of weight and had a median delay in a follow-on infusion of 2 hours. Patients receiving a loading dose and an infusion were less likely to have recurrence when compared to those in whom only a continuous infusion without a bolus was administered.

Several studies have reported risk factors for development of AF in the critically ill patient, mainly in the cardiothoracic surgical setting. Cardiovascular disease has previously been implicated in the development of AF. Factors which are predictive of increasing risk include coronary artery disease, cardiomegaly, low left ventricular ejection fraction, pre-existing cardiovascular disease, and right ventricular dysfunction. Other studies have suggested inflammatory processes as a risk factor for AF, with SIRS, sepsis and a raised C reactive protein being implicated. Consistent with these, we found AF recurrence associated with congestive cardiac failure, altered fluid balance, low serum magnesium and an elevated white cell count, the latter supportive of the association with SIRS. The two patients with hyperthyroidism were not suspected clinically of such at the time of amiodarone administration.

### Response to letter to the editor from sukor et al.: "Evaluation and treatment of amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders" [^5c5bca81]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

We welcome the interest indicated by Dr. Sukor and colleagues in our recent publication and address their several concerns below.

Their first concern regards our not mentioning the patient's heart rate in the discussion section. While we acknowledge the common relationship of heart rate as a reflection of thyroid status, adjunctive therapy with beta-blockers as was employed in our patient, often will mask the chronotropic effect of the thyroid hormones. The patient described had frequent ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation episodes requiring beta-adrenergic blocker therapy, thereby rendering his heart rate not to be a reliable reflection of his thyroid status.

Further, the authors interpret our discussion of the patient's follow-up to indicate advocacy solely for the utility of measurements of free T3/total T3 whereas these remarks were made in the context of reference to the work of Bartalena et al. On the contrary, the value of FT4 assay, alone or together with FT3, clearly is mentioned for both the patient's diagnosis and follow-up and was performed in his case. We do agree with the authors that FT3 can be normal in AIT as it was in our patient.

Finally, the authors' remarks regarding our management with methimazole and prednisone relate to the classification of the patient's AIT as a mixed Type 1/Type 2 instead of Type 1. Although our patient presented with characteristics that pointed more to Type 2 AIT, at present there is no definitive method to specifically distinguish between Type 1 and Type 2 AIT. Consequently. and particularly when a mixed Type 1/ type 2 AIT is suspected in a critically ill patient, treatment with both prednisone and methimazole is advisable. We could not determine whether the observed improvement in serum thyroid hormone levels resulted from a delayed effect of prednisone or the methimazole or both, and the latter was assumed. Methimazole dosage was tapered first when FT4 reached the lower normal range while prednisone therapy was tapered later based on the patient's clinical condition and thyroid function tests, consistent with the approach suggested by the authors.

Amiodarone — evidence for conversion of persistent atrial fibrillation includes the following: In the SAFE‑T trial of persistent AF, conversion occurred in 27% after 28 d with amiodarone versus 24% with sotalol and 0.8% with placebo. Oral amiodarone is associated with a conversion rate between 15% and 40% over a period of 28 d. In a comparative study, amiodarone and propafenone showed similar rates (40%) in persistent AF averaging 5 mo in duration, and all amiodarone conversions occurred after 7 d, with responses between 1 and 14 d. Reported adverse effects include bradycardia, hypotension, visual disturbances, thyroid abnormalities, nausea, constipation, phlebitis with peripheral IV administration, and serious toxicity including death due to bradycardia ending in cardiac arrest.

### Treatment of amiodarone-associated thyrotoxicosis [^74acca2e]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Medium credibility.

Background

A 75-year-old man had a myocardial infarction complicated by poor left ventricular function and non-sustained ventricular tachycardia. He began treatment with amiodarone and 12 months later developed symptoms of thyrotoxicosis.

Investigations

Thyroid function tests after commencement of amiodarone revealed a high-normal level of free T4 and low-normal level of free T3 with a normal serum TSH. When symptoms of thyrotoxicosis developed, significant rises in T4 and T3 levels and suppression of TSH were observed. Thyroid autoantibodies were detected and thyroid ultrasonography revealed a small multinodular goiter.

Diagnosis

Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) with features consistent with both AIT type I (in which thyroid antibodies and nodular goiter are present) and AIT type II (which is not responsive to thionamide therapy and eventually leads to permanent hypothyroidism).

Management

The patient continued to be treated with amiodarone. He commenced thionamide (carbimazole) therapy but failed to improve, even after a dose increase. Glucocorticoid (prednisolone) therapy was therefore added. Combination therapy was associated with gradual clinical and biochemical improvement. The patient became persistently hypothyroid after stopping thionamide and glucocorticoid therapy and was stabilized on long-term thyroxine replacement.

Manage hypothyroidism by reducing the dose of or discontinuing Pacerone and thyroid hormone supplementation.

5.7 Bradycardia

Pacerone causes symptomatic bradycardia or sinus arrest with suppression of escape foci in 2% to 4% of patients. The risk is increased by electrolytic disorders or use of concomitant antiarrhythmics or negative chronotropes [see Drug Interactions (7)]. Bradycardia may require a pacemaker for rate control.

Post-marketing cases of symptomatic bradycardia, some requiring pacemaker insertion and at least one fatal, have been reported when ledipasvir/sofosbuvir or sofosbuvir with simeprevir were initiated in patients on amiodarone. Bradycardia generally occurred within hours to days, but in some cases presented up to 2 weeks after initiating antiviral treatment. Bradycardia generally resolved after discontinuation of antiviral treatment. The mechanism for this effect is unknown. Monitor heart rate in patients taking or recently discontinuing amiodarone when starting antiviral treatment [see Drug Interactions (7)].

### Amiodarone hydrochloride [^e37c924e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Persistence of Adverse Effects

Because of the long half-life of amiodarone (15 to 142 days) and its active metabolite desethylamiodarone (14 to 75 days), adverse reactions and drug interactions can persist for several weeks following amiodarone discontinuation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

5.2 Pulmonary Toxicity

Amiodarone hydrochloride may cause a clinical syndrome of cough and progressive dyspnea accompanied by functional, radiographic, gallium-scan, and pathological data consistent with pulmonary toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity secondary to amiodarone hydrochloride may result from either indirect or direct toxicity as represented by hypersensitivity pneumonitis (including eosinophilic pneumonia) or interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis, respectively. Rates of pulmonary toxicity have been reported to be as high as 17% and is fatal in about 10% of cases. Obtain a baseline chest X-ray and pulmonary-function tests, including diffusion capacity, when amiodarone hydrochloride therapy is initiated. Repeat history, physical exam, and chest X-ray every 3 to 6 months or if symptoms occur. Consider alternative antiarrhythmic therapy if the patient experiences signs or symptoms of pulmonary toxicity. Prednisone 40 to 60 mg/day tapered over several weeks may be helpful in treating pulmonary toxicity.

Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)

Postoperatively, occurrences of ARDS have been reported in patients receiving amiodarone hydrochloride therapy who have undergone either cardiac or noncardiac surgery. Although patients usually respond well to vigorous respiratory therapy, in rare instances the outcome has been fatal.

5.3 Hepatic Injury

Asymptomatic elevations of hepatic enzyme levels are seen frequently, but amiodarone hydrochloride can cause life-threatening hepatic injury. Histology has resembled that of alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis. Obtain baseline and periodic liver transaminases. If transaminases exceed three times normal, or doubles in a patient with an elevated baseline, discontinue or reduce dose of amiodarone hydrochloride, obtain follow-up tests and treat appropriately.

### Glucocorticoid response in amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis resulting from destructive thyroiditis is predicted by thyroid volume and serum free thyroid hormone concentrations [^0482155c]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Context

Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) resulting from destructive thyroiditis (type 2) is commonly treated with glucocorticoids, but time needed to restore euthyroidism may be unacceptable for patients with underlying cardiac disorders.

Objective

The objective of this prospective study was to identify factors affecting the response to glucocorticoids in a large cohort of patients with type 2 AIT followed prospectively.

Setting

This study was conducted at university centers.

Patients

Sixty-six untreated patients with type 2 AIT were enrolled in the study.

Intervention

All patients were treated with prednisone (initial dose, 0.5 mg/kg.d) as long as needed to restore euthyroidism, defined as cure of AIT.

Main Outcome Measure

The main outcome measure was cure time.

Results

The median cure time was 30 d (95% confidence interval, 23–37 d). Serum free T4 concentration (picograms per milliliter) and thyroid volume (milliliters per square meter) (and, to a lesser extent, serum free T3 concentration) at diagnosis were the main determinants of response to glucocorticoids, with a cure hazard ratio of 0.97 (95% confidence interval, 0.95–0.99; P = 0.005) and 0.84 (95% confidence interval, 0.77–0.91; P = 0.000) for unit of increment, respectively. AIT was cured in all patients with a complete follow-up; euthyroidism was reached in 30 d or less in 60% of patients but in more than 90 d in 16%. A prompt control of thyrotoxicosis (≤ 30 d of treatment) was more frequent (77%) in patients with serum basal free T4 concentration no greater than 50 pg/ml and thyroid volume (normalized for body surface area) no greater than 12 ml/m2. The cure probability and the mean cure time in an individual patient can be obtained using a formula generated by multiple regression models.

Conclusions

Baseline serum thyroid hormone concentrations and thyroid volume help identify patients with type 2 AIT at risk of a delayed response to glucocorticoids.

### Exploring current diagnosis and management of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis [^e329f157]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Amiodarone, commonly used to treat various types of arrhythmias, can potentially lead to catastrophic adverse effects like amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT). This review offers insights into diagnosing and managing AIT, involving thyroid function tests, imaging techniques, and strategies to prevent cardiac deterioration and reduce mortality. The approach to managing AIT has shifted from focusing on thyrotoxicosis control to a broader strategy that includes preventing heart deterioration, hospitalizations, and reducing mortality. Healthcare professionals should consider the patient's need for amiodarone, side effects, coexisting conditions, and personal perspective. Routine thyroid function monitoring and collaboration across medical specialties are essential for comprehensive AIT management. Effective management of AIT is crucial to diminish mortality and morbidity. Pharmacological treatment can be initiated. Further intervention such as thyroidectomy is recommended, especially in cases where cardiac status is deteriorating and amiodarone continuation is necessary. In conclusion, early diagnosis and timely treatment through interdisciplinary collaboration according to specific individual case are crucial to reduce morbidity and mortality in AIT patients.

### Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis in a patient with autonomously functioning nodular goiter [^b87b08da]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To report on adverse reactions associated with amiodarone and propylthiouracil.

Case Summary

A 64-year-old female with atrial fibrillation and nodular goiter progressed to overt thyrotoxicosis after receiving therapy with amiodarone 200 mg/day for less than 12 weeks. Thyroid scan revealed a hyperfunctioning nodule in the left lobe, while immunologic studies were negative for both thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies. The thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) receptor antibody level was transiently elevated. Propylthiouracil 100 mg 3 times/day was started after the withdrawal of amiodarone, but the patient developed severe generalized skin rash, fever, and leukocytosis after 4 weeks. Thyroidectomy was performed, and histopathology was compatible with type 1 amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) associated with toxic nodular goiter. An objective causality assessment revealed that thyrotoxicosis was probably related to use of amiodarone.

Discussion

Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent that may cause thyroid dysfunction. Differentiating between the 2 types of AIT is important for implementation of the correct therapeutic strategy. The transient elevation of TSH receptor antibodies in AIT complicated the diagnosis. As a rare subtype, type 1 AIT by nodular goiter may be associated with early AIT. Initiating thyroid function monitoring within 3 months of amiodarone therapy should be considered.

Conclusions

Type 1 AIT caused by nodular goiter is rarely reported. Amiodarone should be avoided in such patients and subtotal thyroidectomy to remove the toxic nodule may be the treatment of choice.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of amiodarone hydrochloride IV (also known as Pacerone, Nexterone):
- **Cardiac toxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone can exacerbate arrhythmias or cause new VF, incessant VT, increased resistance to cardioversion, and polymorphic VT associated with QT prolongation. Initiate amiodarone in a setting where continuous ECG and cardiac resuscitation are available. Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia before initiating treatment.
- **Hepatotoxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of hepatotoxicity. Obtain baseline and periodic liver transaminases. Discontinue or reduce dose if transaminases exceed three times normal or doubles in a patient with an elevated baseline.
- **Pulmonary toxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of pulmonary toxicity, particularly hypersensitivity pneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, and interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis. Cases of postoperative adult respiratory distress syndrome have also been reported. Obtain a baseline CXR and pulmonary function tests, including diffusion capacity, when amiodarone is initiated. Repeat history, physical examination, and CXR every 3–6 months.

### Continuation of amiodarone delays restoration of euthyroidism in patients with type 2 amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis treated with prednisone: a pilot study [^932989ec]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2011). Low credibility.

Context

Type 2 amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) is a destructive thyroiditis usually responsive to glucocorticoids. Whether continuation of amiodarone affects treatment outcome is unsettled.

Objective

The objective of the study was to compare the outcome of glucocorticoid treatment in type 2 AIT patients who continued or withdrew amiodarone.

Design

This was a matched retrospective cohort study.

Setting

The study was conducted at a university center.

Patients

Eighty-three consecutive patients with untreated type 2 AIT participated in the study. After matching with patients continuing amiodarone (AMIO-ON, n = 8), patients interrupting amiodarone were randomly selected in a 4:1 ratio (AMIO-OFF, n = 32).

Intervention

All patients were treated with oral prednisone. Patients whose thyrotoxicosis recurred after glucocorticoid withdrawal were treated with a second course of prednisone.

Main Outcome Measure

Time and rate of cure were measured.

Results

Median time to the first normalization of serum thyroid hormone levels did not significantly differ in AMIO-ON and AMIO-OFF patients (24 and 31 d, respectively; P = 0.326). Conversely, median time for stably restoring euthyroidism was 140 d in AMIO-ON patients and 47 d in AMIO-OFF patients (log rank, P = 0.011). In fact, AIT recurred in five of seven AMIO-ON patients (71.4%) and in only three of 32 AMIO-OFF patients (9.4%, P = 0.002), requiring readministration of prednisone. One AMIO-ON patient never reached thyroid hormone normalization during the study period. Factors associated with glucocorticoid failure were thyroid volume and amiodarone continuation.

Conclusions

Prednisone restores euthyroidism in most type 2 AIT patients, irrespective of amiodarone continuation or withdrawal. However, continuing amiodarone increases the recurrence rate of thyrotoxicosis, causing a delay in the stable restoration of euthyroidism and a longer exposure of the heart to thyroid hormone excess.

### Evaluation and treatment of amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders [^980b0735]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic drug containing 37% iodine by weight, with a structure similar to that of thyroid hormones. Deiodination of amiodarone releases large amounts of iodine that can impair thyroid function, causing either hypothyroidism or thyrotoxicosis in susceptible individuals reflecting ~20% of patients administered the drug. Not only the excess iodine, but also the amiodarone (or its metabolite, desethylamiodarone) itself may cause thyroid dysfunction by direct cytotoxicity on thyroid cells. We present an overview of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of amiodarone-induced thyroid disorders, with a focus on the various forms of clinical presentation and recommendations for personalized management of each form.

A 62-year-old man was found to have bradycardia, hypothermia and respiratory failure 3 weeks after initiation of amiodarone therapy for atrial fibrillation. Thyroid-stimulating hormone was found to be 168 μIU/mL (nl. 0.3–5 μIU/mL) and free thyroxine (FT4) was < 0.2 ng/dL (nl. 0.8–1.8 ng/dL). He received intravenous fluids, vasopressor therapy and stress dose steroids; he was intubated and admitted to the intensive care unit. He received 500 μg of intravenous levothyroxine in the first 18 h of therapy, and 150 µg intravenous daily thereafter. Haemodynamic improvement, along with complete recovery of mental status, occurred after 48 h. Twelve hours after the initiation of therapy, FT4 was 0.96 ng/dL. The patient was maintained on levothyroxine 175 (g POorally daily. A thyroid ultrasound showed diffuse heterogeneity. The 24 hour excretion of iodine was 3657 (mcg (25–756 (mcg). The only two cases of amiodarone-induced myxoedema coma in the literature report patient death despite supportive therapy and thyroid hormone replacement. This case represents the most thoroughly investigated case of amiodarone-induced myxoedema coma with a history significant for subclinical thyroid disease.

Atrial fibrillation — short-term and long-term treatment goals: For patients with symptomatic AF lasting many weeks, initial therapy may be anticoagulation and rate control, while the long-term goal is to restore sinus rhythm. When cardioversion is contemplated and the duration of AF is unknown or exceeds 48 h, patients who do not require long-term anticoagulation may benefit from short-term anticoagulation. Early cardioversion may be necessary if AF causes hypotension or worsening HF, making the establishment of sinus rhythm a combined short- and long-term therapeutic goal. In contrast, amelioration of symptoms by rate control in older patients may steer the clinician away from attempts to restore sinus rhythm. In some circumstances, when the initiating pathophysiology of AF is reversible, as for instance in the setting of thyrotoxicosis or after cardiac surgery, no long-term therapy may be necessary.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^ede93f37]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Drug-associated thyrotoxicosis (Table 16) — agents, mechanisms, onset, and therapy are summarized as follows: Amiodarone iodine induced (type 1) has onset months to years with therapy of supportive care, ATDs; perchlorate, and surgery, and amiodarone thyroiditis (type 2) occurs often > 1 year with therapy of supportive care, corticosteroids, and surgery. Lithium causes painless thyroiditis and GD with onset often > 1 year and therapy of supportive care, ATDs and/or RAI (GD only), and surgery. Interferon α causes painless thyroiditis; GD with onset months and therapy of supportive care and ATDs and/or RAI (GD only). Interleukin-2 causes painless thyroiditis with onset months and therapy of supportive care. Iodinated contrast in the setting of underlying thyroid autonomy presents in weeks to months and is treated with antithyroid drugs. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors cause destruction with onset 3–12 months and therapy of supportive care. Radioactive iodine, early causes destruction with onset 1–4 weeks and therapy of observation; if severe, administer corticosteroids. Radioactive iodine for TMNG, late is associated with GD with onset 3–6 months and therapy of antithyroid drugs, repeat RAI, and surgery. Supportive care may include beta-adrenergic blockers during the thyrotoxic stage and levothyroxine if hypothyroidism develops, and perchlorate is not available in the United States.

### Nexterone (amiodarone hci) [^c3f80e30]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

The institution of antithyroid drugs, β-adrenergic blockers or temporary corticosteroid therapy may be necessary. The action of antithyroid drugs may be especially delayed in amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis because of substantial quantities of preformed thyroid hormones stored in the gland. Radioactive iodine therapy is not recommended because of the low radioiodine uptake associated with amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism.

When aggressive treatment of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis has failed or amiodarone cannot be discontinued because it is the only drug effective against the resistant arrhythmia, surgical management may be an option. Experience with thyroidectomy as a treatment for amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis is limited, and this form of therapy could induce thyroid storm. Therefore, surgical and anesthetic management require careful planning.

Hypothyroidism

Hypothyroidism has been reported in 2 to 10% of patients receiving amiodarone and may be primary or subsequent to resolution of preceding amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. This condition may be identified by clinical symptoms and elevated serum TSH levels. Cases of severe hypothyroidism and myxedema coma, sometimes fatal, have been reported in association with amiodarone therapy. In some clinically hypothyroid amiodarone-treated patients, free thyroxine index values may be normal. Manage hypothyroidism by reducing the dose of or discontinuing NEXTERONE and considering the need for thyroid hormone supplement.

### Ataxia: a diagnostic perplexity and management dilemma [^95cbd783]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 79-year-old woman presented with lower extremity weakness and unsteadiness for 2 weeks. She was recently diagnosed with refractory atrial flutter and was prescribed amiodarone. Physical examination revealed signs of cerebellar dysfunction. Neuroimaging including CT and MRI were unremarkable. Her hospital course included the development of ventricular tachycardia necessitating increment in amiodarone dose. Laboratory studies were unremarkable except mild transaminitis. Other workup including the one for paraneoplastic neurological involvement was negative. The patient experienced worsening of ataxia requiring assistance with ambulation. In view of comprehensive routine negative work-up for ataxia, recent use of amiodarone and worsening of symptomatology with increase in its dosing, drug-induced neurotoxicity from amiodarone was suspected. Amiodarone dose was subsequently reduced and mexilitine was introduced as an additive antiarrhythmic therapy for ventricular tachycardia. In follow-up, the patient experienced significant improvement in her symptoms and was able to ambulate independently. She was subsequently discharged to short-term rehabilitation.

### A multicenter retrospective cohort study on predicting the risk for amiodarone pulmonary toxicity [^82c8ef60]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Amiodarone is a commonly used anti-arrhythmic agent that is lipophilic in nature with large volume of distribution with variable elimination half-life. The prevalence of the adverse side effects associated with amiodarone use was as high as 15% in the first year and 50% with long-term therapy. The important adverse effects of amiodarone include pulmonary toxicity, thyroid dysfunction and hepatotoxicity. According to clinical trials and observational studies, the reported incidence of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity varies from 1 to 10%. One of the proposed pathogenic mechanisms for amiodarone pulmonary toxicity is direct pulmonary toxicity from reduced phospholipid degradation and its accumulation which leads to lipid-laden macrophages formation, lipid peroxidation, reactive oxygen radicals generation, disturbance of cellular calcium and prostaglandin metabolism, and deposition of collagens resulting in lung injury. Interstitial pneumonitis is the most common clinical manifestation of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. Other clinical patterns of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity include eosinophilic pneumonia, organizing pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), diffuse alveolar haemorrhage, lung nodules and pleural effusion.

Reported risk factors of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity include age above 60 years old, duration of amiodarone use of 6 to 12 months, pre-existing lung disease especially chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, male gender, underlying renal disease and elevated plasma monodesethylamiodarone concentration. Despite the fact that majority of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity cases respond to cessation of amiodarone and initiation of steroid treatment, deaths can occur. The mortality was reported to be 10 to 23% in the literature. While there are different patterns of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity, different subtypes correspond to different prognosis. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to amiodarone pulmonary toxicity is associated with mortality up to 50%. On the contrary, patients who presented with pulmonary nodules were reported to have better prognosis.

The studies on amiodarone pulmonary toxicity have significant heterogeneity with variable results on incidence and risk factors. As amiodarone pulmonary toxicity is a potentially fatal adverse effect from amiodarone use, identifying the risk factors for amiodarone pulmonary toxicity would enable clinicians to identify at-risk group and consider appropriate alternative anti-arrhythmic, and also timely arrange assessment imaging for patients on long-term amiodarone.

Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Amiodarone — thyroid effects and monitoring during antiarrhythmic therapy are described as follows: Amiodarone is widely used and it interferes with thyroid function (because of iodine content), and treatment may result in elevation of TSH with increased T4/free T4 and decreased T3, so an increase in T4 alone does not constitute an evidence of hyperthyroidism; thyroid function tests should be evaluated at baseline and every 6 months during amiodarone therapy; positive antithyroid peroxidase antibodies are markers of risk for the development of amiodarone‑induced hypothyroidism (AIH); for AIH, stopping amiodarone or adding hormone replacement are acceptable strategies; in amiodarone‑induced thyrotoxicosis, amiodarone should be stopped.

### Effect of amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism on left ventricular outflow obstruction after septal myectomy for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^aa512da3]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who undergo septal myectomy are at risk for developing postoperative atrial fibrillation. Amiodarone is effective in treating this arrhythmia but is associated with multiple adverse effects, often with delayed onset. A novel case is described of a patient who developed type 2 amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism that presented as recurrence of outflow obstruction after septal myectomy. The patient's symptoms and echocardiographic findings of outflow obstruction resolved substantially with the treatment of the amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism. Amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism of delayed onset can be a subtle diagnosis, requiring a high index of suspicion. In conclusion, recognition of this diagnosis in patients with recurrence of outflow obstruction by symptoms and cardiac imaging after septal myectomy may avoid unnecessary repeat surgical intervention.

Ultrasound of the thyroid was performed in 11 patients, and 2 underwent technetium‐99m‐sestamibi uptake and scintigraphy. Histological diagnosis was included for the two patients who underwent thyroidectomy. Eight had sufficient data for subclassification, and all of them were classified as AIT2. They had a median time of onset after 3.1 (IQR, 2.5–3.6) years of treatment.

Treatment of AIT included amiodarone discontinuation in 12 (50%) patients. In five cases (20.8%), the treatment had been stopped before diagnosis of AIT with a median interval of 278 days (range, 51–410), whereas seven (29.2%) remained on treatment. In patients still using amiodarone at diagnosis of AIT, amiodarone withdrawal was carried out in 3 out of 9 (33.3%) with ventricular arrhythmias as the indication of treatment compared with 9 out of 10 (90%) if the indication was atrial fibrillation or flutter (A.fib/flutter). The pharmacological treatment for AIT consisted of glucocorticoid monotherapy in five patients, thionamide monotherapy in another five, and a combination therapy in eight patients, whereas six received neither treatment. Further comparison of the groups can be seen in Table 3.

### Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis: a case for surgical management [^144f48c8]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

Amiodarone can cause the development of thyroid dysfunction in patients with or without previous thyroid disease. Although most cases of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) are mild, a significant number become life threatening. Because of its pharmacokinetics, simply discontinuing amiodarone provides no relief and can worsen the patient's condition. Medical management frequently fails, and many patients cannot discontinue amiodarone because of its effect against resistant arrhythmias.

Methods

This retrospective chart review of a case at a tertiary care institution presents the case of a fifty-five-year-old male with dilated cardiomyopathy and no previous thyroid disease. The patient was in normal sinus rhythm on amiodarone for control of atrial fibrillation. He experienced the acute onset of symptoms with return to atrial fibrillation resistant to cardioversion. Physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging findings were all consistent with a diagnosis of AIT. An attempt to withdraw amiodarone resulted in severe ventricular tachyarrhythmias.

Results

Despite medical treatment, the patient's condition continued to deteriorate. Because amiodarone was the only effective drug, surgical treatment was elected. The patient underwent a total thyroidectomy and experienced no difficulties or complications. Postoperatively, the patient's condition improved, and he was successfully cardioverted.

Conclusions

Although an uncommon clinical entity, life-threatening AIT has been reported. Thyrotoxicosis can develop in any patient during or after amiodarone therapy. Medical management of this entity is extremely difficult because of the lack of a proven, consistent therapeutic armamentarium. Surgical management should be considered for patients whose conditions necessitate the continuation of amiodarone or those with severe symptoms resistant to medical therapy.

Atrial fibrillation — amiodarone superiority and adverse effects: Multiple randomized trials show amiodarone is effective for maintenance of sinus rhythm and superior to other agents. In SAFE‑T, amiodarone was superior to sotalol and placebo for median time to AF recurrence (487 versus 74 versus 6 days, respectively; P < 0.001). In CTAF, AF recurrence at 16 months was 35% with amiodarone versus 63% with combined propafenone or sotalol (P < 0.001). The adverse‑effect profile is described as onerous, including pulmonary fibrosis, thyroid dysfunction, elevated transaminases, hepatotoxicity, photosensitivity, skin pigmentation changes, peripheral neuropathy, sinus bradycardia, QT prolongation with torsades de pointes, corneal microdeposits, and rarely optic neuropathy, with many clinically relevant drug interactions; therefore, amiodarone is best reserved for patients who do not respond to other recommended antiarrhythmic agents or for whom other antiarrhythmic drugs are contraindicated.

Part 3: arrhythmias

A 56-year-old female with history of hypertension, CAD, chronic kidney disease, and immunoglobulin Gκ multiple myeloma was admitted for treatment with B-cell maturation antigen–directed CAR T cells (idecabtagene vicleucel). On day 3, she developed fever and tachycardia consistent with grade 1 CRS and was placed on telemetry. She was noted to have new-onset atrial fibrillation. She was hemodynamically stable but off her antihypertensive medications. The patient was treated with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab and corticosteroids but her atrial fibrillation persisted, so she was started on amiodarone and placed on telemetry.

We recommend placing all patients who develop CRS on telemetry for monitoring of arrhythmias, if feasible, especially if patients develop grade 2 CRS. Arrhythmias are common after CAR T-cell therapy and consist of approximately two-thirds of the cardiovascular complications after CAR T-cell therapy. On the basis of data from the FDA adverse event reporting system of CD19 CAR T cells, 74% of reported arrhythmias were atrial fibrillation or flutter and 18% were ventricular tachycardias. In the setting of uncontrolled atrial fibrillation with low blood pressure, we may use amiodarone because CRS-related hypotension may often preclude patients from beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers for rate control. For patients with a preserved blood pressure, beta-blockers are commonly used as first-line therapy. These patients usually cannot receive anticoagulants to prevent atrial fibrillation–related embolism, and, thus, the aggressive use of amiodarone may lead to conversion to sinus rhythm. However, if atrial fibrillation persists beyond 48 hours, we typically stop the amiodarone because the risk of embolism with chemical cardioversion increases. We rarely use digoxin in this case, and digoxin should be reserved for patients in whom amiodarone is contraindicated. Patients with hemodynamic instability should be admitted to the ICU, and cardioversion should be considered. Atrial fibrillation can be paroxysmal and resolve in < 24 hours, and we do not use anticoagulation or cardiac medications frequently in that setting. These decisions should be made in consultation with a cardiologist before discharge. For those in whom the atrial fibrillation lasts longer, and stroke risk is high, we first start patients on unfractionated heparin drip when platelet counts are > 50 × 10³/μL and then discharge patients using direct-oral anticoagulants. Most patients who develop atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter during CRS will not likely need long-term anticoagulant. However, the long-term risk of atrial fibrillation recurrence is unknown, and patients will need monitoring. After discharge, we place an ambulatory cardiac monitor to evaluate for arrhythmias. If we do not detect atrial fibrillation at that time, we stop the antiarrhythmic monitoring. For those with persistent atrial fibrillation or flutter, we place an ambulatory cardiac monitor ∼4 or 6 months after treatment, and, again, if no further arrhythmias, we stop the direct-oral anticoagulant and do not pursue further treatment.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Dosage must be individualized based on severity of arrhythmia and response. Use the lowest effective dose. Obtain baseline chest x-ray, pulmonary function tests, thyroid function tests, and liver aminotransferases. Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia before initiating treatment.

Initiate treatment with a loading dose of 800 to 1600 mg/day until initial therapeutic response occurs (usually 1 to 3 weeks). Once adequate arrhythmia control is achieved, or if side effects become prominent, reduce Pacerone tablets dose to 600 to 800 mg/day for one month and then to the maintenance dose, usually 400 mg/day. (2)

Recommended Dosage:

Initiate treatment with a loading dose of 800 to 1600 mg/day until initial therapeutic response occurs (usually 1 to 3 weeks). Once adequate arrhythmia control is achieved, or if side effects become prominent, reduce Pacerone tablet dose to 600 to 800 mg/day for one month and then to the maintenance dose, usually 400 mg/day.

Administration:

Administer Pacerone tablets consistently with regard to meals [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)]. Administration of Pacerone tablets in divided doses with meals is suggested for total daily doses of 1000 mg or higher, or when gastrointestinal intolerance occurs.

### Ataxia caused by amiodarone in older people [^33df3a46]. Age and Ageing (2008). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is recommended for the cardioversion of atrial fibrillation and prevention of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with structural heart disease, coronary artery disease or left ventricular dysfunction. It has well-recognised side-effects on the skin, lungs, liver, thyroid and eyes. Neurological side-effects, including ataxia and neuropathy, also occur, and may be more prevalent in older patients. These side-effects are reversible after cessation of amiodarone. Monitoring of amiodarone therapy should include assessment of the central and peripheral nervous system especially in older patients.

### Hepatic dysfunction and neurotoxicity in a patient receiving long-term low-dose amiodarone therapy [^d0afe3b8]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Amiodarone is commonly used in the treatment of refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Much of the literature focuses on the toxic effects of this medication in the setting of rapid loading or long-term therapy with high maintenance doses. However, patients have been known to develop multi-organ toxicities with long-term low-dose therapy.

Case Report

We present a 90-year-old man with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation undergoing low-dose amiodarone therapy for a period of 18 months without medical follow-up who developed signs and symptoms consistent with neurotoxicity and hepatotoxicity in association with hyperammonemia. Upon discontinuation of the medication and treatment of the hyperammonemia, the patient had a rapid decline in symptoms and a return to his baseline status.

Conclusion

Identifying toxicity early and correcting it rapidly may prevent life-threatening sequelae associated with amiodarone toxicity.
