## Question

Risk of bactrim causing hyperkalemia when PT is taking entresto

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the risk of Bactrim-induced hyperkalemia in patients taking Entresto. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanistic basis by which trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and sacubitril/valsartan each affect potassium handling. Then, I should verify the individual risk profiles for hyperkalemia with each agent and quantify the magnitude from high-quality sources. Next, I will evaluate the pharmacodynamic interaction and consider how patient-specific factors modify risk. After that, I need to outline monitoring protocols and mitigation strategies, including when to avoid the combination or select alternatives. Finally, I will synthesize a decision framework and confirm that my recommendations align with regulatory labeling and guideline statements to ensure clinical fidelity.

> Wait, let me verify the mechanisms before I go further, because the pathophysiology drives everything here; trimethoprim blocks epithelial sodium channels in the distal nephron in an amiloride-like fashion, reducing distal sodium reabsorption and thereby impairing potassium secretion, which can lead to dose-dependent hyperkalemia, particularly in renal impairment or when combined with other potassium-raising drugs, and this is explicitly cautioned in FDA labeling for Bactrim and trimethoprim monotherapy [^116rNx8o] [^112NZoGD].

> I need to check the Entresto side of the equation as well; the valsartan component suppresses aldosterone via angiotensin II receptor blockade, which predictably diminishes renal potassium excretion, and the product labeling for sacubitril/valsartan warns about increased serum potassium, especially in at-risk populations such as those with renal impairment, diabetes, or concomitant potassium-raising medications, with hyperkalemia observed during PARADIGM-HF run-in and described in updated labeling and SPL summaries [^1114Vvrc] [^116u9JqN] [^111H9uEW].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about absolute risk until I quantify the baseline signal; in a large matched cohort of older adults, initiation of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus amoxicillin was associated with a 3.36-fold higher risk of a hospital encounter with hyperkalemia within 14 days, and the absolute risk difference increased with declining eGFR from 0.12% at eGFR ≥ 60 to 1.45% at eGFR < 30, which underscores how renal function drives risk with TMP-SMX even before we layer on RAAS pathway effects [^116C7QHU].

> I should confirm the Entresto-attributed background risk next; during the sacubitril/valsartan run-in of PARADIGM-HF, hyperkalemia led to discontinuation in a subset, and overall trials and SPL materials consistently flag increased serum potassium as an adverse reaction requiring monitoring, which means the combination is stacking two mechanisms that both reduce renal potassium excretion, even though sacubitril/valsartan itself is not uniformly high risk in all-comers and risk concentrates in those with CKD, diabetes, higher baseline potassium, or MRA use [^1114Vvrc] [^111Sp68S] [^111H9uEW].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought this might be an absolute contraindication — let me reconsider and verify labeling carefully; neither Bactrim nor Entresto labeling lists the other as a formal contraindication, but both caution strongly about hyperkalemia with concomitant potassium-raising drugs, and valsartan labeling specifically warns that combination with agents that increase potassium requires monitoring, which makes this a high-risk combination in certain patients rather than an absolute prohibition across the board [^116rNx8o] [^11775u4N] [^1114Vvrc].

> Next, I should review evidence for interaction magnitude to avoid over-extrapolating; the best quantified interaction data are with trimethoprim and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists like spironolactone, where nested case-control studies in older adults show a marked increase in hospitalization for hyperkalemia with TMP-SMX compared with amoxicillin, illustrating the potentiation when trimethoprim is combined with RAAS-modulating, potassium-retaining therapy, although I need to be precise that this is with MRAs, not Entresto, and therefore supports the mechanistic concern rather than providing a direct effect size for the TMP-SMX plus sacubitril/valsartan pairing [^115t4iUb] [^114UzJHp] [^1117gkQr].

> I will now examine patient-specific risk modifiers because they determine whether an interaction translates into clinical events; reduced eGFR, diabetes mellitus, higher baseline serum potassium, advanced age, concurrent MRA or ACEI/ARB therapy, potassium supplements or salt substitutes, and NSAID use each raise the likelihood of hyperkalemia, and both guideline and labeling sources caution either avoidance or close monitoring in such settings, including specific advice to use caution with trimethoprim in patients on RAAS inhibitors or with renal impairment and to avoid potassium salt substitutes in susceptible populations [^113uFQi8] [^11775u4N] [^11322P23].

> Let me first confirm how to translate these risks into practical estimates without overstating certainty; for a relatively low-risk patient on sacubitril/valsartan with normal renal function and baseline potassium under 4.5 mEq/L, adding standard-dose TMP-SMX likely confers a moderate incremental risk above baseline, whereas in moderate to high-risk profiles — such as eGFR 30–59 mL/min, diabetes, or baseline potassium 4.5–5.0 mEq/L — the absolute risk climbs meaningfully, and in CKD stage 4–5 or with concomitant MRA use the risk can become clinically significant, which aligns with the gradient of absolute risk reported with TMP-SMX across eGFR strata and the recognized RAASi-related hyperkalemia vulnerability in trials and labeling [^116C7QHU] [^1114Vvrc].

> Hold on, I should verify monitoring recommendations and ensure timing aligns with the pharmacology; trimethoprim's potassium effect emerges early, so obtaining baseline potassium and creatinine before starting TMP-SMX, rechecking within 3–7 days of initiation, and increasing frequency to every 2–3 days in high-risk scenarios or high-dose regimens is a reasonable, evidence-aligned approach, with guidelines recommending cautionary prescribing of trimethoprim in RAASi users or renal impairment, initiation of potassium-lowering interventions when potassium reaches at least 5.5 mmol/L, and ongoing potassium surveillance in CKD, HF, or diabetes [^113uFQi8] [^113YXfBL] [^116NkTYS].

> I need to ensure that mitigation strategies are explicit and actionable; in patients where TMP-SMX is not essential, selecting lower-risk alternatives such as amoxicillin, nitrofurantoin, or cefalexin for susceptible infections can reduce hyperkalemia risk, while also advising avoidance of potassium supplements, potassium-containing salt substitutes, and NSAIDs during the concomitant therapy window given the valsartan interaction profile and the observed lower hyperkalemia signal with these comparators in observational data [^11775u4N] [^116C7QHU] [^117HdMFG].

> But wait, what if TMP-SMX is necessary due to organism susceptibility or indication such as PJP; I should double-check high-dose scenarios and contingency plans; the Bactrim label notes progressive, reversible potassium rises at higher doses, so if TMP-SMX must be used, employ the lowest effective dose, maintain or optimize loop diuretic therapy if clinically appropriate to enhance kaliuresis, intensify laboratory monitoring, and be prepared to temporarily adjust or hold sacubitril/valsartan if potassium rises to severe thresholds, consistent with guideline advice on RAASi interruption in the setting of significant hyperkalemia or acute intercurrent illness [^116rNx8o] [^115WcS2L].

> I will now examine acute management thresholds to ensure safety nets are clear; for potassium of 5.5 mmol/L or higher, initiate potassium-lowering strategies per guideline pathways, and for severe hyperkalemia or ECG changes, use calcium for membrane stabilization and intracellular shift therapies such as insulin with dextrose, with consideration of modern potassium binders as adjuncts to facilitate ongoing RAASi when clinically necessary, acknowledging that UK recommendations also specify RAASi discontinuation at higher potassium thresholds in selected contexts [^113YXfBL] [^116Vgddg] [^115cUUuf].

> Hmm, I should verify diet and education pieces because they are often overlooked; patients with CKD and persistent hyperkalemia should receive targeted dietary counseling, and those on sacubitril/valsartan plus TMP-SMX should be counseled to avoid potassium-enriched salt substitutes during therapy, consistent with safety guidance on potassium-containing products and dietetics recommendations in at-risk patients [^111GoG94] [^11322P23].

> Let me reconsider the edge cases to avoid overgeneralization; I initially conflated the robust TMP-SMX interaction data with MRAs to imply the same magnitude with sacubitril/valsartan, but I should confirm that while the direction of risk is consistent mechanistically, the exact effect size for TMP-SMX plus Entresto has not been quantified and is likely lower than with MRAs, which reinforces the need for individualized risk assessment rather than a blanket prohibition [^115t4iUb] [^1114Vvrc].

> Next, I should review a concise decision sequence to keep this practical; assess baseline risk by eGFR, baseline potassium, diabetes status, age, and concomitant potassium-raising drugs, prefer non–potassium-raising antibiotic alternatives when infection severity and susceptibilities allow, if TMP-SMX is chosen obtain baseline labs and recheck potassium within 3–7 days with earlier checks in high-risk patients, suspend TMP-SMX and consider holding or down-titrating sacubitril/valsartan if potassium exceeds clinically significant thresholds, and resume RAASi once potassium stabilizes, as maintaining RAASi therapy confers prognostic benefit when safe to do so [^116C7QHU] [^1114Vvrc] [^115WcS2L].

> In conclusion, the combination of Bactrim and Entresto presents a clinically meaningful hyperkalemia risk via complementary mechanisms of impaired renal potassium excretion, the magnitude of which escalates with declining kidney function, diabetes, higher baseline potassium, older age, and concomitant potassium-raising therapies, and safe use hinges on judicious antibiotic selection, baseline and early follow-up potassium monitoring, patient education to avoid exogenous potassium and NSAIDs, and readiness to modify therapy promptly if potassium rises, all consistent with product labeling and contemporary guideline guidance [^116rNx8o] [^1114Vvrc] [^113uFQi8].

Co-administration of Bactrim (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) with Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan) **significantly increases the risk of hyperkalemia** due to additive effects on potassium retention [^111H9uEW] [^116rNx8o]. The risk is highest in patients with renal impairment, diabetes, or baseline potassium > 5.0 mmol/L [^111H9uEW] and can be **life-threatening** [^1179Cqu6] [^114wT2Gr]. If co-administration is necessary, **monitor serum potassium and renal function within 3–5 days** of starting Bactrim and at least weekly during therapy. Consider alternative antibiotics when possible [^notfound].

## Mechanisms of hyperkalemia with bactrim and entresto

### Bactrim (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole)

Trimethoprim component blocks **epithelial sodium channels** [^112NZoGD] in the distal nephron, reducing sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion, mimicking amiloride and causing potassium retention [^116rNx8o]. Clinical evidence shows that high-dose trimethoprim (e.g. for P. jirovecii pneumonia) commonly causes **progressive, reversible hyperkalemia**, and even standard doses can cause hyperkalemia in patients with renal impairment or on other potassium-raising drugs [^116C7QHU].

---

### Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan)

Entresto combines valsartan — an ARB that reduces aldosterone and decreases renal potassium excretion, thereby **increasing serum potassium** [^11775u4N] — with sacubitril, a neprilysin inhibitor that increases natriuretic peptides and can further reduce aldosterone and potassium excretion [^116u9JqN]. Hyperkalemia is a known adverse effect, especially in patients with renal impairment, diabetes, or baseline potassium > 5.0 mmol/L [^1114Vvrc] [^111H9uEW].

---

## Clinical evidence of hyperkalemia risk with concomitant use

Although no large trials specifically evaluate Bactrim plus Entresto, **strong evidence** shows that Bactrim markedly increases hyperkalemia risk [^116rNx8o] when combined with RAAS inhibitors (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, MRAs) [^116C7QHU] [^113jGwY1]; Entresto contains an ARB [^111H9uEW]. Trimethoprim plus RAAS inhibitors was associated with a **12-fold increased risk of hyperkalemia hospitalization** versus amoxicillin in elderly patients on spironolactone (adjusted OR 12.4, 95% CI 7.1–21.6) [^1117gkQr]. Trimethoprim plus ACE inhibitors/ARBs similarly increases **hyperkalemia risk**, especially in patients with renal impairment or diabetes [^1148ZfsU] [^116C7QHU]. Given Entresto's ARB component, **similar risk is expected** when combined with Bactrim [^11775u4N].

---

## Patient populations at increased risk

Certain patients are at **particularly high risk** for hyperkalemia with Bactrim and Entresto:

- **Renal impairment**: Reduced potassium excretion increases hyperkalemia risk [^116C7QHU].

- **Diabetes mellitus**: Often coexists with renal impairment and increases risk [^111H9uEW] [^114XLerS].

- **Baseline hyperkalemia**: Potassium > 5.0 mmol/L at baseline increases risk [^111H9uEW] [^1137mjsn].

- **Elderly patients**: Age-related renal decline and comorbidities increase risk [^114zDsQs] [^111qQPoq].

---

## Clinical consequences of hyperkalemia

Hyperkalemia can cause **potentially fatal cardiac arrhythmias** [^1179Cqu6] and cardiac arrest [^114wT2Gr], and can produce severe neuromuscular impairment with muscle weakness and paralysis [^114wT2Gr]. It is associated with higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, especially in CKD and heart failure [^114wT2Gr] [^1179Cqu6].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Given the **significant risk**, clinicians should follow these recommendations:

- **Avoidance**: Avoid concomitant use of Bactrim and Entresto when possible, especially in high-risk patients [^113uFQi8].

- **Monitoring**: If co-administration is necessary, monitor serum potassium and renal function closely (within 3–5 days of starting Bactrim and at least weekly during therapy) [^116rNx8o] [^112RLHGt].

- **Alternative antibiotics**: Consider alternatives (e.g. amoxicillin, nitrofurantoin) that do not increase potassium [^1148ZfsU].

- **Patient education**: Educate patients on hyperkalemia symptoms (muscle weakness, palpitations, fatigue) and when to seek care [^112sDH5S].

---

## Management strategies for hyperkalemia

In cases of **hyperkalemia**, consider the following:

- **Discontinue contributing medications**: Stop Bactrim and/or Entresto if possible [^112sDH5S] [^115cUUuf].

- **Pharmacologic interventions**: Use potassium binders (patiromer, sodium zirconium cyclosilicate), insulin with glucose, beta-agonists, and sodium bicarbonate as appropriate [^116Vgddg] [^117FVX6D].

- **Dialysis**: Consider in severe or refractory cases [^1158EG2z].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Recommendation** | **Details** |
|-|-|
| Avoid concomitant use | Especially in patients with renal impairment, diabetes, or baseline hyperkalemia [^113uFQi8] |
| Monitor closely | Serum potassium and renal function within 3–5 days of starting Bactrim; at least weekly thereafter [^116rNx8o] [^112RLHGt] |
| Consider alternatives | Amoxicillin, nitrofurantoin, or other antibiotics that do not increase potassium [^1148ZfsU] [^1117gkQr] |
| Educate patients | Symptoms of hyperkalemia and when to seek medical attention [^112sDH5S] |
| Manage hyperkalemia promptly | Discontinue contributing drugs; use potassium-lowering therapies; consider dialysis if severe [^116Vgddg] [^117FVX6D] |

---

Co-administration of Bactrim and Entresto **significantly increases hyperkalemia risk** due to additive effects on potassium retention. Clinicians should avoid this combination when possible; if use is necessary, monitor closely and use alternative antibiotics in high-risk patients.

### Hyperkalemia: pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^114wT2Gr]. Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

The most notorious consequence of hyperkalemia is potentially fatal cardiac dysrhythmia. However, several other consequences are worthy of discussion. Hyperkalemia is associated with increased mortality, although it is unclear whether it causes increased mortality outside of the context of cardiac arrhythmia in extreme hyperkalemia. Consequently, hyperkalemia — or the fear of it — may prompt changes in prescribing practices, such as avoiding RAS blockade and MRAs. Recent data also show that hyperkalemia can cause renal tubular acidosis and may contribute to peripheral neuropathy in CKD patients.

- **Mortality: epidemiology**: Large observational studies demonstrate an association between hyperkalemia and an increased risk of death. A meta-analysis of data from over 1.2 million individuals with CKD showed that serum [K+] exhibited a U-shaped relationship with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, with a nadir at approximately 4.2 mM. The adjusted hazard ratio for all-cause mortality was approximately 1.22 for [K+] > 5.5 mM. This association persisted after adjusting for a large number of covariates. However, as there have been no large interventional studies testing the effects of potassium-lowering therapies (or plasma [K+] targets) per se on mortality, it is unknown if this association is due to residual confounding. That is, it remains uncertain whether mild-to-moderate hyperkalemia directly causes an increased risk of death.

The most plausible mechanism by which hyperkalemia could cause death is through the induction of fatal cardiac arrhythmia.

### Bactrim [^116rNx8o]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Electrolyte abnormalities:

- **Hyperkalemia**: High dosage of trimethoprim, as used in patients with P. jirovecii pneumonia, induces a progressive but reversible increase of serum potassium concentrations in a substantial number of patients. Even treatment with recommended doses may cause hyperkalemia when trimethoprim is administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism, with renal insufficiency, or if drugs known to induce hyperkalemia are given concomitantly. Close monitoring of serum potassium is warranted in these patients.

- **Hyponatremia**: Severe and symptomatic hyponatremia can occur in patients receiving Bactrim, particularly for the treatment of P. jirovecii pneumonia. Evaluation for hyponatremia and appropriate correction is necessary in symptomatic patients to prevent life-threatening complications.

- **Crystalluria**: During treatment, ensure adequate fluid intake and urinary output to prevent crystalluria. Patients who are "slow acetylators" may be more prone to idiosyncratic reactions to sulfonamides.

### SPL drug information for sacubitril / valsartan [^111H9uEW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of sacubitril / valsartan PO (also known as Entresto):

- **Angioedema**: Use extreme caution in Black patients, as they are at higher risk of angioedema than non-Black patients.

- **Hypotension**: Use caution in patients with volume or salt depletion and/or receiving high doses of diuretics.

- **Increased serum lithium levels**: Use caution in patients taking lithium. Monitor lithium levels.

- **Increased serum potassium**: Use caution in patients with risk factors for hyperkalemia, such as severe renal impairment, diabetes, hypoaldosteronism, or those on potassium-sparing diuretics or a high potassium diet.

- **Oliguria, renal failure**: Use caution in patients with renal dysfunction, severe congestive heart failure, or concomitant use of NSAIDs. Closely monitor serum creatinine. Down-titrate or interrupt sacubitril/valsartan if a clinically significant decrease in renal function occurs.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole induced hyperkalaemia in elderly patients receiving spironolactone: Nested case-control study [^1117gkQr]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

Spironolactone is a non-selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist used to treat systolic heart failure, resistant hypertension, ascites, and hyperaldosteronism. The prescribing of spironolactone increased considerably after the publication of the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES), which showed that the drug could reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction. Although spironolactone was generally well tolerated in that study, serious hyperkalaemia is an important consideration for patients receiving the drug in clinical practice. Subsequent research has shown that hyperkalaemia occurs in up to a third of patients receiving spironolactone, emphasizing the need for regular monitoring of electrolytes and the avoidance of other drugs that can cause hyperkalaemia.

The antibiotic trimethoprim has structural and pharmacological similarities to the potassium-sparing diuretic amiloride and reduces urinary potassium excretion by approximately 40%. The inhibition of potassium secretion results in a dose-related antikaliuretic effect that may predispose susceptible people to clinically important hyperkalaemia. In combination with sulfamethoxazole, trimethoprim is commonly used for the treatment of urinary tract infections. Because trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and spironolactone are both widely used drugs, the likelihood of co-prescription is high. However, the risk of hyperkalaemia associated with the combined use of these drugs has not been systematically studied, and evidence supporting a clinically meaningful drug interaction is lacking.

### Trimethoprim use for urinary tract infection and risk of adverse outcomes in older patients: Cohort study [^112KC9xp]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Covariates were considered based on a priori knowledge as potential confounders in the relation between trimethoprim and outcomes like acute kidney injury, hyperkalaemia, or sudden death. These included sex, age, calendar period, chronic comorbidities, history of renal or urological disease, baseline renal function, prescriptions for renin-angiotensin system blockers (such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers) or potassium-sparing diuretics, lifestyle factors (including smoking, alcohol intake, and body mass index), ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. All covariates, except for sex and ethnicity, were updated over time.

- **Age group**: Defined in the following bands at the time of antibiotic initiation: 65–69; 70–74; 75–79; 80–84; and 85 and over.

- **Calendar period**: Included as a covariate to adjust for changes in clinical, diagnostic, and administrative practices over the study period, which may influence the choice of antibiotic treatment for UTIs, measurement of renal function, and registration of outcomes. The periods considered were 1997–2000, 2001–04, 2005–08, 2009–11, and 2012–15.

- **Chronic comorbidities**: These included diabetes mellitus, ischaemic heart disease, cardiac failure, arrhythmia, and hypertension, identified from both primary care and hospital data. Individuals were considered to have a specific comorbidity if a code was recorded in their electronic health records before a UTI episode treated with antibiotics.

Baseline renal function was defined using the most recent biochemical test results recorded in primary care at any time before the UTI episode.

### SPL drug information for eprosartan mesylate / hydrochlorothiazide [^111QXatg]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of eprosartan PO (also known as Teveten HCT):

- **Exacerbation of hyperkalemia**: Use caution with pre-existing hyperkalemia.
- **Exacerbation of hypovolemia**: Use caution with pre-existing hypovolemia or those receiving high doses of diuretics.
- **Oliguria**: Use caution in individuals whose renal function is critically dependent on the activity of the RAAS.

### Initiating sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696) in heart failure: Results of TITRATION, a double-blind, randomized comparison of two uptitration regimens [^113uTMDu]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

The TITRATION study was not hypothesis-driven as its primary objective was to characterize the tolerability of initiating sacubitril/valsartan using 'conservative' and 'condensed' uptitration regimens. Consequently, the sample size was designed not to establish the statistical significance of observed differences between uptitration regimens or strata, but to provide precise estimates of event rates within each stratum and regimen.

Assuming a 1:1 stratification between high/low ACEI/ARB dose strata and based on estimated event rates of approximately 1.7% for hypotension, 1.2% for hyperkalaemia, 1.6% for renal dysfunction, and 0.1% for angioedema from PARADIGM-HF data at that time, a sample size of 120 per treatment per stratum (totaling 480 for both arms) was expected to provide adequate precision of the estimates. The lengths of the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for these estimates were 0.045, 0.038, 0.044, and 0.011, respectively.

The primary analysis summarized descriptive statistics of count and percentage of the pre-specified adverse events and laboratory assessments throughout the double-blind treatment phase within each stratum and uptitration regimen. For each event, the annualized percentage for the overall population was estimated using an exponential survival regression model, with uptitration regimen and pre-study ACEI/ARB treatment level stratum (high/low) as fixed-effect factors. For stratum-specific estimates, separate exponential regression models with the uptitration regimen as a fixed-effect factor were used.

### Management of severe hyperkalemia [^116Vgddg]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is one of the few potentially lethal electrolyte disturbances. Prompt recognition and expeditious treatment of severe hyperkalemia are expected to save lives. This review is intended to provide intensivists and other interested clinicians with an understanding of the pathophysiology that underlies hyperkalemia and a rational approach to its management.

- **Methods**: This article reviews and analyzes literature relevant to the pathophysiology and management of severe hyperkalemia. Methods include searching MEDLINE and conducting a bibliographic search of textbooks and journal articles.

- **Results and conclusions**: A more complete understanding of potassium homeostasis in recent years has led to new approaches to the management of severe hyperkalemia. The physiologically based sequential approach still applies. The efficacy, pitfalls, and risks of the agents available for use at each step in the sequence are critically reviewed. Rational use of the available tools will allow clinicians to successfully treat severe hyperkalemia.

### Clinical impact of suboptimal RAASi therapy following an episode of hyperkalemia [^114Rwz1s]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Low credibility.

In the US subgroup with CKD stage 3 or 4 (irrespective of HF), the risk of the cardiorenal composite was 17.3% (95% CI 15.7–18.8%) in those who discontinued and 10.0% (9.1–10.9%) in those who maintained or up-titrated [Additional file 4]. In Japan, the corresponding risks were 17.5% (13.2–21.5%) and 12.8% (10.4–15.1%).

In the US subgroup with HF (irrespective of CKD), the risk of the cardiorenal composite was 24.5% (95% CI 22.5–26.4%) in those who discontinued and 16.6% (15.2–18.0%) in those who maintained or up-titrated [Additional file 5]. In Japan, the corresponding risks were 20.8% (18.6–22.8%) and 16.3% (14.8–17.7%).

The 6-month risks of the components of the cardiorenal composite are presented in Table 5 and with Kaplan–Meier plots in Additional file 6. Overall, the pattern of lower risk of cardiorenal events with maintained or up-titrated RAASi treatment was also observed for the individual components of the cardiorenal composite outcome. As mentioned above, the number of patients with down-titration was low.

### Potassium-enriched salt substitutes: A review of recommendations in clinical management guidelines [^11322P23]. Hypertension (2024). Low credibility.

A frequently raised concern about the use of potassium-enriched salts is the risk of hyperkalemia. This is particularly important in the context of patients with chronic kidney disease, where there is longstanding advice to avoid dietary potassium, but sometimes, it is more broadly applied to other population subgroups.

- **Guidelines and recommendations**: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the United Kingdom, for example, advises that salt substitutes containing potassium chloride should not be used by older people, people with diabetes, pregnant women, people with kidney disease, and people taking some antihypertensive drugs, such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers.

- **Current evidence on hyperkalemia risk**: The rationale for broad contraindications like those applied in the United Kingdom remains unclear. The most recent review of trials of potassium-enriched salt identified no effect on hyperkalemia risk. In the recently reported DECIDE salt study, salt substitute–induced hyperkalemia was identified; however, sustained elevations were uncommon and there were no adverse effects associated with the observed elevations.

- **Notable trials and studies**: Of note, the DECIDE salt study design included people regardless of potential hyperkalemia risk, whereas all other studies have used some form of screening to avoid use in those potentially contraindicated. In SSaSS, the largest trial to collect safety data related to potassium-enriched salts, the highly pragmatic design meant that there was no informative cutoff applied.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole induced hyperkalaemia in elderly patients receiving spironolactone: Nested case-control study [^113LrTY6]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

From within the cohort of patients receiving spironolactone, we selected up to four controls for each case using incidence density sampling. We required controls to have had no hospital admission for hyperkalaemia before the index date and to have received one of the study antibiotics within 14 days before the index date. Consequently, all cases and controls were older patients receiving spironolactone who had also received treatment with one of the study antibiotics.

We matched controls and cases on age at the index date (plus or minus one year), sex, presence or absence of diabetes (based on a review of the validated Ontario Diabetes Database), and presence or absence of chronic kidney disease, determined from physicians' claims, hospital admission records, and receipt of dialysis in the year before the index date. Each patient could serve only once as a control. When fewer than four control patients were available for each case, we analyzed only those controls and maintained the matching process. We excluded any cases that could not be matched to at least one control.

### Hyperkalemia: pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^111XW4c8]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

Recent advances have improved our understanding of the mechanisms maintaining potassium homeostasis and the clinical consequences of hyperkalemia. In this article, we discuss these advances within a concise review of the pathophysiology, risk factors, and consequences of hyperkalemia. We highlight aspects that are particularly relevant for clinical practice.

Hyperkalemia occurs when renal potassium excretion is limited by reductions in glomerular filtration rate, tubular flow, distal sodium delivery, or the expression of aldosterone-sensitive ion transporters in the distal nephron. Accordingly, the major risk factors for hyperkalemia are renal failure, diabetes mellitus, adrenal disease, and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or potassium-sparing diuretics.

Hyperkalemia is associated with an increased risk of death, and this is only in part explicable by hyperkalemia-induced cardiac arrhythmia. In addition to its well-established effects on cardiac excitability, hyperkalemia could also contribute to peripheral neuropathy and cause renal tubular acidosis. Hyperkalemia — or the fear of hyperkalemia — contributes to the underprescription of potentially beneficial medications, particularly in heart failure. The newer potassium binders could play a role in attempts to minimize reduced prescribing of renin–angiotensin inhibitors and mineralocorticoid antagonists in this context.

Adverse reactions include angioedema, hypotension, impaired renal function, and hyperkalemia, as detailed in the warnings and precautions sections [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2–5.5)].

- **Clinical trials experience**: Clinical trials are conducted under various conditions; hence, the adverse reaction rates observed in one drug's trials cannot be directly compared to another and may not reflect actual practice rates.

A total of 6,622 heart failure patients were treated with Entresto in the PARADIGM-HF (vs. enalapril) and PARAGON-HF (vs. valsartan) clinical trials. Of these patients, 5,085 were exposed to the medication for at least one year.

- **Adult heart failure**: In PARADIGM-HF, patients underwent sequential enalapril and Entresto run-in periods of a median of 15 and 29 days, respectively, before entering the randomized double-blind period comparing Entresto and enalapril. During the enalapril run-in period, 1,102 patients (10.5%) permanently discontinued the study, with 5.6% discontinuing due to adverse events, primarily renal dysfunction (1.7%), hyperkalemia (1.7%), and hypotension (1.4%). During the Entresto run-in period, an additional 10.4% of patients permanently discontinued treatment, with 5.9% due to adverse events, most commonly renal dysfunction (1.8%), hypotension (1.7%), and hyperkalemia (1.3%).

### How dangerous is hyperkalemia [^1179Cqu6]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte disorder, increasingly observed in patients with renal disease, heart failure, and those using certain medications, such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors. Traditional views that hyperkalemia can be reliably diagnosed by electrocardiogram and that specific levels of hyperkalemia confer cardiotoxic risk have been challenged by several reports of patients with atypical presentations. Epidemiologic data demonstrate strong associations between hyperkalemia and morbidity and mortality; however, these associations appear disconnected in certain patient populations and differing clinical presentations.

Physiologic adaptation, structural cardiac disease, medication use, and the degree of concomitant illness might predispose certain patients with hyperkalemia to a lower or higher threshold for toxicity. These factors are often overlooked, yet data suggest that the clinical context in which hyperkalemia develops is at least as important as the degree of hyperkalemia in determining patient outcomes. This review summarizes the clinical data linking hyperkalemia with poor outcomes and discusses how the efficacy of certain treatments might depend on the clinical presentation.

### Trimethoprim is associated with a greater risk of acute kidney injury and hyperkalaemia in older adults compared with other antibiotics used to treat UTIs [^115oidKL]. BMJ Evidence-Based Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is the most common bacterial infection in older adults. Trimethoprim is a first-line antibiotic prescribed in the UK for acute uncomplicated UTI. Trimethoprim reduces potassium excretion in the distal nephron, which can cause elevated potassium levels. This is of particular importance in older adults, who are more likely to have comorbidities requiring prescription of additional medicines that may predispose them to hyperkalaemia, such as renin-angiotensin antagonists (RAA).

### Clinical impact of suboptimal RAASi therapy following an episode of hyperkalemia [^116BZkmK]. BMC Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

The cardiorenal composite outcome was defined as any of the following: hospitalization for heart failure (HF) with HF as the main diagnosis; an emergency visit for HF, with HF diagnosed in any position recorded in the emergency department or as the hospital admission diagnosis; and progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), including initiation of hemodialysis or diagnosis of ESKD or chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage 5 recorded in hospital, emergency, or outpatient settings. The risk of the cardiorenal composite outcome in relation to patient-level changes in RAASi treatment following an episode of hyperkalemia (HK) was assessed at six months using the Kaplan-Meier method. The components of the cardiorenal composite outcome were also analyzed separately for CKD and HF patient cohorts.

To avoid immortal time bias, the person-time at risk began on the day of the filled prescription for patients who filled a RAASi prescription within 90 days. In those without a filled prescription within 90 days, the person-time at risk started at the index hyperkalemia episode. The risk of the cardiorenal composite outcome was described in relation to dose changes for RAASi overall, as an average of all RAASi classes used by the patient, as well as per each RAASi class. Patients were censored at the end of continuous enrollment or the last date of available data.

As death is a competing risk in the cardiorenal composite, the risk of the cardiorenal composite, including all-cause mortality, was also assessed, and the risk of all-cause mortality as an individual outcome was described.

To account for potential confounders in the association between patient-level changes…

### Clinical outcomes of sacubitril/valsartan in patients with acute heart failure: A multi-institution study [^113QdFi4]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Low credibility.

This study has several limitations. First, because of the retrospective nature of the study, the two study groups may have had inherent differences. To reduce selection bias, we used propensity score weighting to balance differences associated with major characteristics at baseline. To further rule out possible residual confounding even after IPTW, we adjusted for the covariates with absolute STD values > 0.1 in the survival models. However, we could not exclude the possibility of residual or unmeasured confounding factors.

Second, we did not have regular echocardiography follow-up data, which may have provided more direct evidence of cardiac improvement in the patients treated with sacubitril–valsartan. Additionally, we did not have concomitant pharmacological treatment data during the follow-up period, which could have affected the clinical outcomes.

Third, because of the relatively low number of patients, we could not adjust for covariates when comparing the risk of the primary composite outcome in the sacubitril/valsartan users among those who could tolerate doses of ≥ 200 mg/day, 100 mg, or ≤ 50 mg at baseline and 3 months. Fourth, not all patients had NP-pro BNP data at baseline and 12 months of follow-up.

Finally, underestimation resulting from noncompliance is likely because information on prescribed drugs may not reflect the actual use.

In conclusion, compared with ACEI/ARB therapy, initiating sacubitril–valsartan therapy in patients hospitalized for acute HF was associated with lower rates of rehospitalization for HF and death.

### Trimethoprim use for urinary tract infection and risk of adverse outcomes in older patients: Cohort study [^1148ZfsU]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

Our results show that trimethoprim is associated with a greater risk of acute kidney injury and hyperkalaemia compared with other antibiotic drugs for a urinary tract infection, among the general population aged 65 and over, and not just those treated with renin-angiotensin system blockers. However, this is not associated with an increased risk of death.

### Hyperkalemia: pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^117EeUAj]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

For most patients, RAS blockade with a single agent confers a low risk of hyperkalemia. Patients at risk can be identified by the presence of classical risk factors discussed earlier. A risk score combining six risk factors — male sex, baseline [K+], eGFR, diabetes, heart failure, and use of potassium-sparing diuretics — performed well at predicting hyperkalemia after initiation of RAS inhibitors (RASis) in Swedish and American populations.

However, there are significant risks when the RAS is targeted with multiple agents. The risks of dual blockade were revealed by large RCTs: Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiorenal Endpoints (ALTITUDE), Veterans Affairs Nephropathy in Diabetes (VA NEPHRON-D), and Ongoing Telmisartan Alone and in Combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET). The first two trials, conducted in patients with type 2 diabetes, were terminated early due to safety concerns. Hyperkalemia (> 6 mM) was significantly more common in the dual-blockade group than in a single-blockade control group (11.2% versus 7.2% in ALTITUDE and 9.9% versus 4.4% in VA NEPHRON-D). This effect was also present but less marked in ONTARGET, which studied a population with less advanced renal disease and less than 40% prevalence of diabetes.

### Carospir [^112QHaWX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**:

- **Hyperkalemia**: Monitor serum potassium within one week of initiation and regularly thereafter [5.1].
- **Hypotension and worsening renal function**: Monitor volume status and renal function periodically [5.2].
- **Electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities**: Monitor serum electrolytes, uric acid, and blood glucose periodically [5.3].
- **Gynecomastia**: Carospir can cause gynecomastia [5.4].

- **Hyperkalemia**: Carospir can cause hyperkalemia, a risk that increases with impaired renal function or concomitant potassium supplementation, potassium-containing salt substitutes, or drugs that increase potassium, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Monitor serum potassium within one week of initiation or titration of Carospir and regularly thereafter. Closer monitoring may be necessary when Carospir is administered with other drugs that cause hyperkalemia or in patients with impaired renal function. If hyperkalemia occurs, decrease the dose or discontinue Carospir and treat hyperkalemia.

- **Hypotension and worsening renal function**: Excessive diuresis may lead to symptomatic dehydration, hypotension, and worsening renal function, particularly in salt-depleted patients or those taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. Worsening of renal function can also occur with the concomitant use of nephrotoxic drugs (e.g. aminoglycosides, cisplatin, and NSAIDs). Monitor volume status and renal function periodically.

- **Electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities**: In addition to causing hy, further monitoring is essential.

### Effect of treatment with sacubitril/valsartan in patients with advanced heart failure and reduced ejection fraction: a randomized clinical trial [^116vLjVh]. JAMA Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

Use of sacubitril/valsartan is not endorsed by practice guidelines for patients with New York Heart Association class IV heart failure with reduced ejection fraction due to limited clinical experience in this population.

The objective was to compare treatment with sacubitril/valsartan to valsartan in patients with advanced heart failure, reduced ejection fraction, and recent New York Heart Association class IV symptoms.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted including 335 patients with advanced heart failure. The trial began on March 2, 2017 and was stopped early on March 23, 2020, due to the COVID-19 risk.

- **Intervention**: Patients were randomized to receive either sacubitril/valsartan (target dose, 200 mg twice daily) or valsartan (target dose, 160 mg twice daily) in addition to recommended therapy.

- **Main outcomes and measures**: The area under the curve (AUC) for the ratio of N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) compared with baseline was measured through 24 weeks of therapy.

- **Results**: Of the 335 patients included in the analysis, 245 were men (73%) with a mean (SD) age of 59.4 (13.5) years. Seventy-two eligible patients (18%) could not tolerate sacubitril/valsartan, 100 mg/d, during the short run-in period, and 49 patients (29%) discontinued sacubitril/valsartan during the 24 weeks of the trial. The median NT-proBNP AUC for the valsartan treatment arm (n = 168) was 1.19 (IQR, 0.91–1.64), whereas the AUC for the sacubitril/valsartan treatment arm (n = 167) was 1.08.

### Kerendia [^113Mh4B2]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

- **Warnings and precautions**: Hyperkalemia is a significant concern. Patients with decreased kidney function and higher baseline potassium levels are at increased risk. It is crucial to monitor serum potassium levels and adjust the dose as needed.

- **Hyperkalemia**: Kerendia can cause hyperkalemia [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. The risk for developing hyperkalemia increases with decreasing kidney function and is greater in patients with higher baseline potassium levels or other risk factors for hyperkalemia. Measure serum potassium and eGFR in all patients before initiating treatment with Kerendia and dose accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)]. Do not initiate Kerendia if serum potassium is greater than 5.0 mEq/L.

	- Measure serum potassium periodically during treatment with Kerendia and adjust the dose accordingly [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. More frequent monitoring may be necessary for patients at risk for hyperkalemia, including those on concomitant medications that impair potassium excretion or increase serum potassium [see Drug Interactions (7.1, 7.2)].

### Evaluating the risk of hyperkalaemia and acute kidney injury with cotrimoxazole: a retrospective observational study [^112amNq7]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2020). Low credibility.

Increasing antimicrobial resistance has renewed interest in older, less used antimicrobials. Cotrimoxazole shows promise; however, hyperkalaemia and acute kidney injury (AKI) are potential complications. Identifying risk factors and quantification of these events is required for safe use. This study aimed to evaluate predictors of cotrimoxazole-associated AKI and hyperkalaemia in a clinical setting.

Patients prescribed cotrimoxazole were identified using electronic healthcare records over three years (1 April 2016 to 31 March 2019). Individual risk factors were recognized. Serum creatinine and potassium trends were analyzed over the subsequent 21 days. AKI and patients with hyperkalaemia were classified using Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) and laboratory criteria. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed.

Among 214 patients prescribed cotrimoxazole, 42 (19.6%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 14.6–25.7) met AKI criteria and 33 (15.4%, 95% CI 11.0–21.1) developed hyperkalaemia. Low baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (< 60 mL/min/1.73 m², odds ratio (OR) 7.78, 95% CI 3.57–16.13, p < 0.0001) and cardiac disorders (OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.17–4.82, p 0.011) predicted AKI, while low baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (< 60 mL/min/1.73 m², OR 6.80, 95% CI 3.09–15.06, p < 0.0001) and higher baseline serum potassium (p 0.001) predicted hyperkalaemia. Low-dose cotrimoxazole (< 1920 mg/d) was associated with lower AKI and hyperkalaemia risk (p 0.007 and 0.019, respectively).

### Hyperkalemia: Pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^1157By8d]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

There have been significant recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that maintain potassium homeostasis and the clinical consequences of hyperkalemia. In this article, we discuss these advances within a concise review of the pathophysiology, risk factors, and consequences of hyperkalemia. We highlight aspects that are of particular relevance for clinical practice.

Hyperkalemia occurs when renal potassium excretion is limited by reductions in glomerular filtration rate, tubular flow, distal sodium delivery, or the expression of aldosterone-sensitive ion transporters in the distal nephron. Accordingly, the major risk factors for hyperkalemia are renal failure, diabetes mellitus, adrenal disease, and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or potassium-sparing diuretics.

Hyperkalemia is associated with an increased risk of death, and this is only in part explicable by hyperkalemia-induced cardiac arrhythmia. In addition to its well-established effects on cardiac excitability, hyperkalemia could also contribute to peripheral neuropathy and cause renal tubular acidosis. Hyperkalemia — or the fear of hyperkalemia — contributes to the underprescription of potentially beneficial medications, particularly in heart failure. The newer potassium binders could play a role in attempts to minimize reduced prescribing of renin-angiotensin inhibitors and mineralocorticoid antagonists in this context.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole induced hyperkalaemia in elderly patients receiving spironolactone: Nested case-control study [^115t4iUb]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

The objectives of this study were to characterize the risk of hospital admission for hyperkalaemia in elderly patients treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in combination with spironolactone.

- **Design**: This was a population-based nested case-control study.
- **Setting**: The study was conducted in Ontario, Canada, from 1 April 1992 to 1 March 2010.
- **Participants**: Cases included residents of Ontario aged 66 years or above who were receiving chronic treatment with spironolactone and admitted to hospital with hyperkalaemia within 14 days of receiving a prescription for either trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin, norfloxacin, or nitrofurantoin. Up to four controls for each case were identified from the same cohort, matched on age, sex, and presence or absence of chronic kidney disease and diabetes. They were required to have received one of the study antibiotics within 14 days before the case's index date.
- **Main outcome measures**: The study measured the odds ratio for the association between hospital admission with hyperkalaemia and receipt of a study antibiotic in the preceding 14 days, adjusted for conditions and drugs that may influence the risk of hyperkalaemia.

During the 18-year study period, 6,903 admissions for hyperkalaemia were identified, 306 of which occurred within 14 days of antibiotic use. Of these, 248 (81%) cases were matched to 783 controls. Among spironolactone users, 10.8% (17,859/165,754) received at least one prescription for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Compared with amoxicillin, the prescription of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with a marked increase in the risk of hospital admission for hyperkalaemia (adjusted odds ratio 12.4, 95% confidence intervals).

### Hyperkalemia: pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^113jGwY1]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

Due to the pivotal role of aldosterone in the control of potassium homeostasis, MR antagonist (MRA) therapy is a risk factor for hyperkalemia. In a meta-analysis of RCTs conducted in over 16,000 patients with heart failure or after myocardial infarction, hyperkalemia (defined by the individual studies as [K+] > 5.5 or 6.0 mM) occurred in 4.3% of patients allocated to placebo versus 9.3% of patients allocated to MRAs.

Famously, dangerous hyperkalemia became more common after the publication of the Randomized Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES), which demonstrated a morbidity and mortality benefit from spironolactone therapy in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Large-scale data linkage in a Canadian population revealed that the rates of both hospitalization for hyperkalemia and in-hospital hyperkalemia-related mortality more than doubled after the publication of RALES in September 1999.

In animal models and in Phase 1/2 clinical trials, novel non-steroidal MR antagonists have shown a more favorable therapeutic index than spironolactone or eplerenone; they carry a lower risk of hyperkalemia at therapeutic doses in heart failure and proteinuric chronic kidney disease (CKD).

Large data-linkage studies are helping to quantify the risk of hyperkalemia associated with other medications. For example, trimethoprim prescription for urinary tract infections, compared with alternative antibiotics, was associated with a small increase in the odds of hyperkalemia in patients over 65 years of age. For every 1000 infections, treatment with trimethoprim rather than alternative antibiotics showed…

- **Warnings and precautions**:
	- **Hyperkalemia**: Monitor serum potassium within one week of initiation and regularly thereafter.
	- **Hypotension and worsening renal function**: Monitor volume status and renal function periodically.
	- **Electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities**: Monitor serum electrolytes, uric acid, and blood glucose periodically.
	- **Gynecomastia**: Aldactone can cause gynecomastia.

- **Hyperkalemia**:
	- Aldactone can cause hyperkalemia, a condition where potassium levels in the blood become too high. The risk of hyperkalemia is increased by impaired renal function or concomitant potassium supplementation, potassium-containing salt substitutes, or drugs that increase potassium, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers [see Drug Interactions (7.1)]. Monitor serum potassium within one week of initiation or titration of Aldactone and regularly thereafter. More frequent monitoring may be needed when Aldactone is administered with other drugs that cause hyperkalemia or in patients with impaired renal function. If hyperkalemia occurs, decrease the dose or discontinue Aldactone, and treat hyperkalemia.

- **Hypotension and worsening renal function**:
	- Excessive diuresis may cause symptomatic dehydration, hypotension, and worsening renal function, particularly in salt-depleted patients or those taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers. Worsening of renal function can also occur with concomitant use of nephrotoxic drugs, such as aminoglycosides, cisplatin, and NSAIDs. It is crucial to monitor volume status and renal function periodically.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and the risk of a hospital encounter with hyperkalemia: a matched population-based cohort study [^116C7QHU]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Low credibility.

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) can cause hyperkalemia by reducing renal potassium excretion. We assessed the risk of hyperkalemia after initiating TMP-SMX versus amoxicillin and determined if this risk is modified by a patient's baseline kidney function [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)].

- **Methods**: We conducted a population-based cohort study in Ontario, Canada involving adults ≥ 66 years of age newly treated with TMP-SMX (n = 58,999) matched 1:1 with those newly treated with amoxicillin (2008–2020). The primary outcome was a hospital encounter with hyperkalemia defined by a laboratory serum potassium value ≥ 5.5 mmol/L within 14 days of antibiotic treatment. Secondary outcomes included a hospital encounter with acute kidney injury (AKI) and all-cause hospitalization. Risk ratios (RRs) were obtained using a modified Poisson regression.

- **Results**: A hospital encounter with hyperkalemia occurred in 269/58,999 (0.46%) patients treated with TMP-SMX versus 80/58,999 (0.14%) in those treated with amoxicillin [RR 3.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.62–4.31]. The absolute risk of hyperkalemia in patients treated with TMP-SMX versus amoxicillin increased progressively with decreasing eGFR (risk difference of 0.12% for an eGFR ≥ 60 ml/min/1.73 m², 0.42% for eGFR 45–59, 0.85% for eGFR 30–44 and 1.45% for eGFR < 30; additive interaction P < .001). TMP-SMX versus amoxicillin was associated with a higher risk of a hospital encounter with AKI [RR 3.15, 95% CI 2.82–3.51] and all-cause hospitalization [RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.34–1.53].

- **Conclusions**: The 14-day risk of a hospital encounter with hyperkalemia is significantly higher in patients treated with TMP-SMX compared to those treated with amoxicillin, particularly in individuals with decreased baseline kidney function.

### Management of hyperkalemia: An update for the internist [^112sDH5S]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a clinically important electrolyte abnormality that occurs most commonly in patients with chronic kidney disease. Due to its propensity to induce electrophysiological disturbances, severe hyperkalemia is considered a medical emergency. The management of acute and chronic hyperkalemia can be achieved through the implementation of various interventions, one of which is the elimination of medications that can raise serum potassium levels. Many such medications, especially inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, have shown beneficial effects in patients with cardiovascular and renal disease. Therefore, their discontinuation for reasons of hyperkalemia represents an undesirable clinical compromise.

The emergence of two new potassium-binding medications for acute and chronic therapy of hyperkalemia may soon allow the continued use of medications such as renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors even in patients who are prone to hyperkalemia. This review article provides an overview of the physiology and the pathophysiology of potassium metabolism and hyperkalemia, the epidemiology of hyperkalemia, and its acute and chronic management.

We discuss in detail emerging data about new potassium-lowering therapies and their potential future role in clinical practice.

### The management of hyperkalemia in patients with cardiovascular disease [^113km3w7]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The development of hyperkalemia is common in patients with cardiac and kidney disease who are administered drugs that antagonize the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). As the results of large-scale clinical trials in hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and congestive heart failure demonstrate benefits of RAAS blockade, alone or in some cases in combination therapies, the incidence of hyperkalemia has increased in clinical practice. Although there is potential for adverse events in the presence of hyperkalemia, there are also potential benefits of RAAS blockers that support their use in high-risk patient populations. Management of hyperkalemia may be improved by identifying the levels of potassium that may potentially induce harm and using appropriate strategies to avert levels that may be dangerous or life-threatening.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole induced hyperkalaemia in elderly patients receiving spironolactone: nested case-control study [^114UzJHp]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

- **Association between hospital admission involving hyperkalaemia and recent antibiotic use**: The study investigates the link between hospital admissions for hyperkalaemia and recent use of the antibiotic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) in elderly patients receiving spironolactone. The analysis was adjusted for factors such as age category, congestive heart failure, chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease, Charlson co-morbidity index, income level, living in a long-term care facility, the number of prescription drugs in the previous year, duration of spironolactone treatment, and concurrent use of specific drugs (β adrenergic receptor blockers, potassium-sparing diuretics, non-potassium sparing diuretics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, potassium supplements, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibitors).

The population attributable fraction was 59.7%, indicating that approximately 60% of all hyperkalaemia cases in older patients taking spironolactone and treated for a urinary tract infection could be prevented if trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was not prescribed.

A sensitivity analysis was conducted due to partial matching of cases. This analysis matched cases and controls only by sex, ensuring each case had at least one matched control. The results of this sensitivity analysis were consistent with those obtained from the originally matched cohort.

### Efficacy and safety of low-dose sacubitril/valsartan in heart failure patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117E6V2h]. Clinical Cardiology (2023). High credibility.

Heart failure (HF), the most detrimental and costly disease, is a major public health problem affecting approximately 40 million adults globally. In spite of guideline-recommended optimal medical therapy, the prognosis of HF remains poor, and the mortality and morbidity remain high over a 5-year period.

As a novel treatment option for HF, sacubitril/valsartan showed a remarkable reduction in HF hospitalization (21%) and all-cause mortality (16%) in the prospective comparison of angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor to determine impact on global mortality and morbidity in HF (PARADIGM-HF) trial. Similarly, real-world beneficial effects of sacubitril/valsartan on improvement in biomarkers, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, and cardiac reverse remodeling, together with a reduction in hospitalization for HF, were also described by several recent reports.

In particular, all selected patients in the PARADIGM-HF trial were required to enter a single-blind prerandomization run-in phase to ensure they tolerated a prespecified maximum dose of sacubitril/valsartan. As a result, a large proportion of patients (74.76%) achieved the target dose of sacubitril/valsartan in the trial. Indeed, it is well known from registry data that a low dose of sacubitril/valsartan is very common in the real-world clinical setting due to several factors such as symptomatic hypotension, hyperkalemia, renal dysfunction, and worsening HF, which was a clear difference from the landmark trial. Two studies discovered that underdose of sacubitril/valsartan was common in clinical practice.

### Serum potassium in the PARADIGM-HF trial [^111Sp68S]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2020). Low credibility.

The design, methods, and principal results of the PARADIGM-HF trial have been previously reported. In brief, the trial was a randomized, double-blind, prospective comparison of the effect of sacubitril (97 mg) and valsartan (103 mg) administered twice daily (LCZ696, 200 mg twice daily) and that of enalapril (10 mg twice daily) in 8,399 patients with chronic heart failure (HF) [New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes II–IV] and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of ≤ 40%. Prior to randomization, all participants underwent single-blind, sequential run-in periods to ensure the tolerability of both study drugs at target doses.

Eligible patients were those treated with an appropriate regimen of background HF medications at stable doses for at least four weeks, including an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) (at a dose equivalent to enalapril 10 mg/day or greater) and a beta-blocker (unless not tolerated). The use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) was left to the discretion of the investigators but was encouraged if tolerated.

Key exclusion criteria included symptomatic hypotension, a systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 25% (amended to 35%) between screening and randomization, and a serum potassium level of > 5.2 mmol/L at screening or > 5.4 mmol/L at randomization. Serum potassium was measured at every study visit.

### Cardiovascular and renal treatment in heart failure patients with hyperkalemia or high risk of hyperkalemia: Rationale and design of the CARE-HK in HF registry [^115UNkd6]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2025). High credibility.

Despite guideline recommendations, many patients with heart failure (HF) do not receive target dosages of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASis) in clinical practice due, in part, to concerns about hyperkalemia (HK).

- **Methods and results**: This noninterventional, multinational, multicenter registry (NCT04864795; 111 sites in Europe and the United States) enrolled 2,558 eligible adults with chronic HF, mostly with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Eligibility criteria included the use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin-II receptor blockers/angiotensin-receptor-neprilysin inhibitors, being a candidate for, or treatment with a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and increased risk of HK (e.g. serum potassium > 5.0 mmol/L), history of HK in the previous 24 months, or estimated glomerular filtration rate < 45 mL/min/1.73 m². Information on RAASi and other guideline-recommended therapies was collected retrospectively and prospectively (≥ 6 months). Patients were followed according to local clinical practice without study-specific visits or interventions. The main objectives were to characterize RAASi treatment patterns compared with guideline recommendations, describe RAASi modifications following episodes of HK, and describe RAASi treatment in patients treated with patiromer. Baseline characteristics for the first 1,000 patients are presented.

- **Conclusions**: CARE-HK is a multinational prospective HF registry designed to report on the management and outcomes of patients with HF at high risk for HK in routine clinical practice.

### Reduced risk of hyperkalemia during treatment of heart failure with mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists by use of sacubitril/valsartan compared with enalapril: A secondary analysis of the PARADIGM-HF trial [^112QD4q8]. JAMA Cardiology (2017). High credibility.

Consensus guidelines recommend the use of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) for selected patients with symptomatic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) to reduce morbidity and mortality; however, the use of MRAs in combination with other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system increases the risk of hyperkalemia.

The objective of this study was to determine whether the risk of hyperkalemia associated with the use of MRAs for patients with HFrEF is reduced by sacubitril/valsartan in comparison with enalapril.

The PARADIGM-HF (Prospective Comparison of ARNI With an ACE-Inhibitor to Determine Impact on Global Mortality and Morbidity in Heart Failure) trial randomly assigned 8,399 patients with chronic heart failure, New York Heart Association class II to IV symptoms, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40% or less to treatment with either enalapril 10 mg twice daily or sacubitril/valsartan 97/103 mg twice daily (previously known as LCZ696 [200 mg twice daily]) in addition to guideline-directed medical therapy. The use of MRAs was encouraged but left to the discretion of study investigators. Serum potassium levels were measured at every study visit.

The incidence of hyperkalemia (potassium level > 5.5 mEq/L) and severe hyperkalemia (potassium level > 6.0 mEq/L) among patients treated or not treated with an MRA at baseline, and the risk of subsequent hyperkalemia for those newly treated with an MRA during study follow-up, were defined in time-updated Cox proportional hazards models. Analyses were conducted between August 1 and October 15, 2016.

### SPL drug information for trimethoprim [^112NZoGD]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration. High credibility.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of trimethoprim PO:

- **Hyperkalemia**: Use caution with pre-existing risk factors (e.g. renal disease, advanced age). Monitor serum potassium levels in patients with risk factors for developing drug-induced hyperkalemia. If hyperkalemia occurs, discontinue trimethoprim PO, manage potassium levels appropriately, and consider alternative treatment options if necessary.

- **Pseudomembranous colitis**: Use caution if presenting with diarrhea after antibacterial use. Use trimethoprim judiciously and avoid unnecessary or prolonged use to reduce the risk of pseudomembranous colitis. If pseudomembranous colitis occurs, discontinue trimethoprim, initiate appropriate treatment for Clostridium difficile infection, and consider alternative antibiotics if necessary.

### Beta-blockers, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and the risk of hyperkalemia requiring hospitalization in the elderly: a nested case-control study [^114FScZe]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

- **Objectives**: The simultaneous use of beta-adrenergic receptor blockers (beta-blockers) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) may confer a high risk of hyperkalemia.

- **Design, setting, participants, & measurements**: Two nested case-control studies were conducted to examine the association between hospitalization for hyperkalemia and the use of TMP-SMX in older patients receiving beta-blockers. Linked health administrative records from Ontario, Canada, were used to assemble a cohort of 299,749 beta-blocker users, aged 66 years or older, to capture data regarding medication use and hospital admissions for hyperkalemia.

- **Results**: Over the study period from 1994 to 2008, 189 patients in this cohort were hospitalized for hyperkalemia within 14 days of receiving a study antibiotic. Compared with amoxicillin, the use of TMP-SMX was associated with a substantially greater risk of hyperkalemia requiring hospital admission (adjusted odds ratio, 5.1; 95% confidence interval, 2.8 to 9.4). No such risk was identified with ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, or nitrofurantoin. When dosing was considered, the association was greater at higher doses of TMP-SMX. When the primary analysis was repeated in a cohort of non-beta-blocker users, the risk of hyperkalemia comparing TMP-SMX to amoxicillin was not significantly different from that found among beta-blocker users.

- **Conclusions**: Although TMP-SMX is associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia in older adults, these findings show no added risk when used in combination with beta-blockers.

### Altace [^115ZVoGL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

- **Hyperkalemia**: In clinical trials with Altace, hyperkalemia (serum potassium > 5.7 mEq/L) occurred in approximately 1% of hypertensive patients receiving Altace. In most cases, these were isolated values that resolved despite continued therapy. None of these patients were discontinued from the trials because of hyperkalemia. Risk factors for the development of hyperkalemia include renal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus, and the concomitant use of other drugs that raise serum potassium levels. Monitor serum potassium in such patients [see Drug Interactions (7.2)].

- **Cough**: Presumably caused by inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, a persistent nonproductive cough has been reported with all ACE inhibitors and always resolves after discontinuation of therapy. Consider the possibility of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor-induced cough in the differential diagnosis of cough.

### Updates on medical management of hyperkalemia [^117FVX6D]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2019). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially fatal electrolyte disorder, more commonly present when the potassium excretion capacity is impaired. Hyperkalemia can lead to adverse outcomes, especially due to severe cardiac arrhythmias. It can also impair the cardiovascular effects of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASis) and potassium-rich diets, as hyperkalemia frequently leads to their discontinuation.

Potassium is a predictor of mortality and should be monitored closely for patients who are at risk for hyperkalemia. Acute hyperkalemia protocols have been revised and updated. Randomized trials have shown that the new anti-hyperkalemic agents, patiromer and zirconium cyclosilicate, are effective hyperkalemia treatment options. The use of anti-hyperkalemic agents may allow for a less restrictive potassium diet and lower RAASi discontinuation rates.

Hyperkalemia should be monitored closely for high-risk patients, as it is associated with adverse outcomes. New therapies have demonstrated effective control, offering hope for potential use in patients that would benefit from diet or medications associated with an increase in serum potassium, indicating that the use of hyperkalemic agents can be associated with better outcomes.

### Hospital-acquired hyperkalemia events in older patients are mostly due to avoidable, multifactorial, adverse drug reactions [^111qQPoq]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2019). Low credibility.

Drug-induced hyperkalemia is a frequent and severe complication in the hospital setting. While other risk factors may also induce hyperkalemia, the combination of drugs and precipitating factors has not been extensively studied. The aim of the study was to identify drug-induced hyperkalemia events in hospitalized older patients and to describe their combinations with precipitating factors.

Two experts independently analyzed retrospective data of patients aged 75 years or more. Experts identified 471 hyperkalemia events and concluded that 379 (80.5%) were induced by drugs. The cause was multifactorial (i.e. at least one drug with a precipitating factor) in 300 (79.2%) of the 379 drug-induced hyperkalemia cases. Most of the drug-induced hyperkalemia events were avoidable (79.9%), mainly because of the multifactorial cause, such as dosage adaptation during acute kidney injury. Drug-induced hyperkalemia events are frequently combined with precipitating factors in hospitalized older patients, and their prevention should focus on these combinations.

### Clinical practice guidelines treatment of acute hyperkalaemia in adults [^115cUUuf]. UKKA (2023). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for hyperkalemia, particularly in patients on RAAS inhibitor therapy, the UKKA 2023 guidelines recommend discontinuing RAAS inhibitors in patients with serum potassium levels ≥ 6 mmol/L who do not meet the criteria for treatment with patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate.

### Real-world associations of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor dose, hyperkalemia, and adverse clinical outcomes in a cohort of patients with new-onset chronic kidney disease or heart failure in the United Kingdom [^111JpAPV]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Low credibility.

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a key role in the regulation of blood volume, blood pressure, and cardiovascular function. Modification of the RAAS through the use of RAAS inhibitors (RAASi), such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), is an important therapeutic option for the treatment of numerous cardiorenal conditions. It reduces the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD), improves heart function, and decreases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, RAASi use is known to reduce potassium (K+) excretion and increase the risk of hyperkalemia in an already vulnerable population.

Hyperkalemia is a potentially life-threatening electrolyte imbalance, defined as a serum/plasma K+ level above the normal physiological range of 3.5 to 5.0 mmol/L. It can induce electrophysiological disturbances, potentially leading to cardiac arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, and sudden death. The long-term management of serum K+ often requires down-titration or discontinuation of RAASi. This approach is supported by UK clinical practice guidelines: the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommends not offering RAASi to CKD patients whose pretreatment serum K+ is > 5.0 mmol/L and discontinuing them in patients whose serum K+ reaches ≥ 6.0 mmol/L, whereas guidelines from the UK Renal Association advocate cautious use or avoidance of drugs that impair K+ elimination, including RAASi.

### Hyperkalemia: Pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^114XLerS]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

Factors contributing to hyperkalemia are multifaceted. Renal impairment, either acute kidney injury (AKI) or advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), and any acquired or inherited defects in potassium excretion in the distal nephron are primary culprits. In CKD, hyperkalemia typically manifests when the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) falls below 15 mL/min.

A meta-analysis of data from over 1.2 million individuals with CKD revealed significant insights. The risk of hyperkalemia (potassium > 5.5 mM) strongly correlated with eGFR across the entire range of kidney function (from eGFR 15 to 105 mL/min). A decrease in eGFR of 15 mL/min approximately doubled the odds of developing hyperkalemia. Although albuminuria also emerged as a risk factor, its association with hyperkalemia was considerably weaker, with an odds ratio of less than 2 even in cases of heavy albuminuria.

- **Additional individual risk factors**: Include male sex, non-black race, lower body mass index, smoking, history of diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease or stroke, and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), or potassium-sparing diuretics. Conversely, the use of thiazide or loop diuretics proved protective against hyperkalemia.

- **Drug-induced hyperkalemia**: Various medications are known to contribute to hyperkalemia. While the table listing these drugs was referenced, it is absent in the text, necessitating focus on the discussed pharmacological risks.

### A physiologic-based approach to the treatment of acute hyperkalemia [^1158EG2z]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Hyperkalemia is a common and potentially lethal disorder. Given its variable presentation, clinicians should maintain a high index of suspicion, particularly in patients with chronic kidney disease. The present case highlights key physiologic mechanisms in the development of hyperkalemia and provides an outline for emergent treatment. In this context, we discuss specific mechanisms of action of available treatments for hyperkalemia.

### Optimally managing hyperkalemia in patients with cardiorenal syndrome [^116gSUAg]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors (RAASi) are now a standard treatment in most patients with cardiovascular disease, especially in those with heart failure (HF). The European Society of Cardiology and the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association have given a Class IA recommendation for the use of RAASi in the treatment of Classes II-IV symptomatic HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF), based on their strong clinical benefits of lowering all-cause mortality and HF hospitalizations in these subjects. However, RAASi therapy or adding mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in subjects receiving background angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers may be associated with an increased risk of hyperkalemia (HK), especially in those with reduced kidney function.

As a result, a significant proportion of these subjects either have RAASi dose reduced or more often discontinued when they develop HK. Discontinuation of RAASi in patients hospitalized with HFREF was associated with higher postdischarge mortality and rehospitalization rates, while optimal dosing of RAASi significantly reduced median hospital stays, outpatient visits, and related costs. Thus, effective treatment is required to lower potassium levels and maintain normokalemia in subjects with HF and reduced kidney disease who develop or are at risk of HK, thus enabling them to continue their RAASi therapy and maximize benefits from RAASi. In this review, we provide an up-to-date review of the prevalence and significance of HK in patients with cardiorenal syndrome.

### Hyperkalemia: Pathophysiology, risk factors and consequences [^111x4uMn]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2019). Low credibility.

The introduction of new potassium binders, patiromer and zirconium cyclosilicate, has refocused attention on hyperkalemia. Significant recent advances have been made in understanding the mechanisms that maintain potassium homeostasis and the clinical consequences of hyperkalemia. In this article, we aim to present these recent advances in the context of a concise review of the pathophysiology, risk factors, and consequences of hyperkalemia. We will highlight aspects that are particularly relevant for clinical practice.

### Reduced loop diuretic use in patients taking sacubitril/valsartan compared with enalapril: The PARADIGM-HF trial [^116cFrmv]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2019). Low credibility.

Diuretic use has been implicated in greater risk for hypotension in patients receiving renin–angiotensin system inhibitors; if diuretic doses were not down-titrated in patients taking sacubitril/valsartan in response to reduced clinical need, this may have resulted in over-diuresis that could contribute to hypotension. This possibility underscores the importance of assessment and potential adjustment of diuretic doses prior to and following the initiation of an angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor.

Several limitations of this analysis should be noted. The differential use of diuretics among participants randomized to sacubitril/valsartan compared to enalapril was not a pre-specified analysis. Doses of diuretics were not available for all participants, which could lower the precision of dose change comparisons between groups. We compared diuretic use at discrete time points and may have missed interim changes in diuretic use that may not have been captured at study visits. Diuretic dose changes were not available at earlier time points after randomization, which could have been of interest given the quick onset of NT-proBNP reduction by sacubitril/valsartan. Additionally, there was limited information on medication dose changes during the run-in period of the PARADIGM-HF trial; these data could have further informed trends on diuretic dose adjustments after the initiation of sacubitril/valsartan. Reasons for diuretic dose changes were not captured in the study. Lastly, there could be incomplete capture of non-loop diuretic changes or addition of MRAs.

In summary, treatment with сакубитрил/валсартан necessitates careful monitoring and adjustment of diuretic doses to minimize the risk of hypotension due to over-diuresis.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole induced hyperkalaemia in elderly patients receiving spironolactone: Nested case-control study [^116pTnuv]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to characterize the risk of admission to hospital for hyperkalaemia in elderly patients treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in combination with spironolactone. This population-based nested case-control study was conducted in Ontario, Canada, from April 1, 1992, to March 1, 2010.

Participants in the study were Ontario residents aged 66 years or older receiving chronic treatment with spironolactone, who were admitted to the hospital with hyperkalaemia within 14 days of receiving a prescription for either trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amoxicillin, norfloxacin, or nitrofurantoin. Up to four controls for each case were identified from the same cohort, matched on age, sex, and the presence or absence of chronic kidney disease and diabetes, who also received one of the study antibiotics within 14 days before the case's index date.

The main outcome measures were the odds ratio for the association between admission to hospital with hyperkalaemia and receipt of a study antibiotic in the preceding 14 days, adjusted for conditions and drugs that may influence the risk of hyperkalaemia.

During the 18-year study period, 6,903 admissions for hyperkalaemia were identified, of which 306 occurred within 14 days of antibiotic use. Of these, 248 (81%) cases were matched to 783 controls. It was found that 10.8% (17,859/165,754) of spironolactone users received at least one prescription for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Compared with amoxicillin, the prescription of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was associated with a marked increase in the risk of admission to hospital for hyperkalaemia, with an adjusted odds ratio of 12.4.

### Amlodipine and valsartan [^11775u4N]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

Valsartan interacts with various agents that can lead to important clinical effects:

- **Agents increasing serum potassium**: Concomitant use of valsartan with other agents that block the renin-angiotensin system, potassium-sparing diuretics (e.g. spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride), potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium, or other drugs that may increase potassium levels (e.g. heparin) may lead to increases in serum potassium and, in heart failure patients, increases in serum creatinine. If co-medication is considered necessary, monitoring of serum potassium is advisable.

- **Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents including selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors)**: In patients who are elderly, volume-depleted (including those on diuretic therapy), or with compromised renal function, coadministration of NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors, with angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including valsartan, may result in deterioration of renal function, including possible acute renal failure. These effects are usually reversible. Monitor renal function periodically in patients receiving valsartan and NSAID therapy. The antihypertensive effect of angiotensin II receptor antagonists, including valsartan, may be attenuated by NSAIDs, including selective COX-2 inhibitors.

- **Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS)**: Dual blockade of the RAS with angiotensin receptor blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aliskiren is associated with increased risks of hypotension, hyperkalemia, and changes in renal function, including acute renal failure compared to monotherapy.

### Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole induced hyperkalaemia in elderly patients receiving spironolactone: nested case-control study [^112i4R5w]. BMJ (2011). Low credibility.

In this population-based study spanning 18 years, we found that the prescription of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was strongly associated with admission to hospital for hyperkalaemia among elderly patients treated with spironolactone. Treatment with nitrofurantoin was associated with a less pronounced increase in the risk of hospital admission for hyperkalaemia, whereas we found no such risk with norfloxacin. Our findings support the existence of a clinically important and potentially life-threatening drug interaction between trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and spironolactone at the population level. This represents the first estimate of the risk of co-prescribing these drugs in clinical practice.

We found a less striking increase in the risk of hyperkalaemia with nitrofurantoin treatment. This may reflect a "channelling" effect, in which patients at greater risk of hyperkalaemia were more likely to have been prescribed nitrofurantoin rather than trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, although this same phenomenon should also apply to norfloxacin. Some evidence indicates that this association may reflect a causal relation. In vitro experiments show that nitrofurantoin inhibits steroid biosynthesis, resulting in a 50% reduction in aldosterone release from adrenocortical cells. An additional, previously underappreciated drug interaction may thus exist between nitrofurantoin and spironolactone, which may predispose susceptible patients to hyperkalaemia.

Our study has important clinical implications. In our cohort, 10.8% of patients received at least one prescription for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

### Trimethoprim use for urinary tract infection and risk of adverse outcomes in older patients: Cohort study [^117HdMFG]. BMJ (2018). Low credibility.

To determine if trimethoprim use for urinary tract infection (UTI) is associated with an increased risk of acute kidney injury, hyperkalaemia, or sudden death in the general population, a cohort study was conducted. The study utilized UK electronic primary care records from practices contributing to the Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked to the Hospital Episode Statistics database.

Participants included adults aged 65 and over with a prescription for trimethoprim, amoxicillin, cefalexin, ciprofloxacin, or nitrofurantoin prescribed up to three days following a primary care diagnosis of UTI between April 1997 and September 2015.

- **Main outcome measures**: The outcomes were acute kidney injury, hyperkalaemia, and death within 14 days of a UTI treated with antibiotics.

Among a cohort of 1,191,905 patients aged 65 and over, 178,238 individuals were identified with at least one UTI treated with antibiotics, comprising a total of 422,514 episodes of UTIs treated with antibiotics. The odds of acute kidney injury in the 14 days following antibiotic initiation were higher following trimethoprim (adjusted odds ratio 1.72, 95% confidence interval 1.31 to 2.24) and ciprofloxacin (1.48, 1.03 to 2.13) compared with amoxicillin. The odds of hyperkalaemia in the 14 days following antibiotic initiation were only higher following trimethoprim (2.27, 1.49 to 3.45) compared with amoxicillin. However, the odds of death within the 14 days following antibiotic initiation were not higher with trimethoprim than with amoxicillin; in the whole population, the adjusted odds ratio was 0.90 (95% confidence int).

### Initiating sacubitril/valsartan (LCZ696) in heart failure: Results of TITRATION, a double-blind, randomized comparison of two uptitration regimens [^117CMFAx]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2016). Low credibility.

As shown in Figure 3 and Table 3, the incidence of hypotension was 9.7% vs. 8.4% in the 'condensed' and 'conservative' initiation/uptitration regimens, respectively, and for renal dysfunction 7.3% vs. 7.6%. The incidence of hyperkalaemia was 7.7% in the 'condensed' regimen and 4.4% in the 'conservative' regimen. Angioedema was rare, with no cases in the 'condensed' uptitration group and two non-severe cases in the 'conservative' uptitration group, one of which was reassessed by the Angioedema Adjudication Committee as 'not an angioedema event' after the database lock.

- **Primary endpoints by regimen**:
	- (a) Incidence of predefined adverse events.
	- (b) Incidence of systolic blood pressure (SBP) < 95 mmHg and pre-specified laboratory assessments. CI, confidence interval; HR, hazard ratio; SCr, serum creatinine.

- **Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker dose strata**: Hypotension, renal dysfunction, and hyperkalaemia were each more common in the low-dose ACEI/ARB stratum, irrespective of uptitration regimen. The highest rate of these adverse events was observed in the low-dose ACEI/ARB-'condensed' uptitration group. In the high-dose ACEI/ARB stratum, rates of hypotension and renal dysfunction were similar in the two uptitration groups while hyperkalaemia was more frequent in the 'condensed' uptitration group. However, there was no apparent interaction between the ACEI/ARB dose stratum and uptitration regimen.

### Sulfatrim [^114zDsQs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Clinical studies of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. There may be an increased risk of severe adverse reactions in elderly patients, particularly when complicating conditions exist, such as impaired kidney and/or liver function, possible folate deficiency, or concomitant use of other drugs. Severe skin reactions, generalized bone marrow suppression (see warnings and adverse reactions sections), a specific decrease in platelets (with or without purpura), and hyperkalemia are the most frequently reported severe adverse reactions in elderly patients. In those concurrently receiving certain diuretics, primarily thiazides, an increased incidence of thrombocytopenia with purpura has been reported. Increased digoxin blood levels can occur with concomitant sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim therapy, especially in elderly patients. Serum digoxin levels should be monitored. Hematological changes indicative of folic acid deficiency may occur in elderly patients. These effects are reversible by folinic acid therapy.

Appropriate dosage adjustments should be made for patients with impaired kidney function, and the duration of use should be as short as possible to minimize the risks of undesired reactions (see dosage and administration sections). The trimethoprim component of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim may cause hyperkalemia when administered to patients with underlying disorders of potassium metabolism or with renal insufficiency.
