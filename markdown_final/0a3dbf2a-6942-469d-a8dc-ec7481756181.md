## Question

How do GIP1-based therapies compare to GLP-1 receptor agonists in terms of efficacy and side effects?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how GIP-based therapies compare to GLP-1 receptor agonists, with emphasis on tirzepatide, covering efficacy, side effects, and practical clinical implications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic distinctions and mechanistic rationale. Then, I should verify glycemic efficacy from head-to-head and meta-analytic data. Next, I will examine weight loss outcomes and dose-response. After that, I need to review hepatic and cardiometabolic effects. I will then assess gastrointestinal tolerability and discontinuation, followed by hypoglycemia and other safety signals. Finally, I should consider guideline positioning, real-world effectiveness, and synthesize a balanced clinical recommendation with caveats and uncertainties.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic distinction and mechanism. GLP-1 receptor agonists such as semaglutide, liraglutide, and dulaglutide mimic endogenous GLP-1 to enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppress glucagon, slow gastric emptying, and reduce appetite, thereby improving glycemia and promoting weight loss [^114bHvUS]. Tirzepatide, the prototypical dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist, co-activates GIP and GLP-1 receptors, leveraging complementary central and peripheral pathways that may enhance insulin sensitivity and weight loss beyond GLP-1 alone, though the precise contribution of GIP signaling in humans remains an area of active investigation [^1114hXc5] [^115oh8ff] [^116PkAw6].

> I will now examine glycemic efficacy. Wait, let me verify the magnitude of HbA1c reduction with tirzepatide versus GLP-1 RAs. In the phase 2 trial, tirzepatide produced dose-dependent HbA1c reductions up to about 1.9% at 26 weeks, outperforming dulaglutide by roughly 0.5–0.7% across active doses, indicating superior glycemic potency [^1114hXc5]. Meta-analyses of the SURPASS program show tirzepatide lowers HbA1c by approximately 1.24–2.58% depending on dose, again exceeding semaglutide 1 mg in head-to-head comparisons, with a substantial proportion achieving normoglycemia, consistent with class-leading performance [^115oh8ff]. Network meta-analyses corroborate that tirzepatide achieves greater HbA1c lowering than GLP-1 RAs and basal insulin comparators, reinforcing its position as the most potent incretin-based therapy to date [^1172LVDm].

> Next, I should review weight loss outcomes. Hold on, I should verify the dose-response and comparative figures. In obesity trials, tirzepatide produces approximately 15–22.5% mean weight loss at 72 weeks, surpassing semaglutide 2.4 mg by about 6–8 percentage points in head-to-head data, with a higher proportion achieving ≥ 15% and ≥ 20% weight loss thresholds, which is unprecedented for pharmacotherapy [^113tAEne] [^111cpo2m]. Meta-analytic estimates similarly show placebo-adjusted weight losses around 19.2% with tirzepatide versus 15.0% with semaglutide, aligning with the clinical impression of incremental benefit from dual incretin agonism [^114vYeLM]. Let me consider mechanism briefly: beyond GLP-1–mediated appetite suppression and gastric emptying delay, GIP signaling may modulate adipose function and energy expenditure, plausibly contributing to the larger weight loss signal, though mechanistic clarity in humans is still evolving [^115oh8ff] [^116PkAw6].

> I need to check hepatic and broader cardiometabolic effects. Meta-analyses in MAFLD/MASH populations suggest dual agonists reduce liver fat content and transaminases more than GLP-1 RAs, with signals for improved liver stiffness only after longer treatment durations, implying potential antifibrotic benefits with sustained therapy, though histologic outcomes remain limited and longer trials are needed [^112pbhNr] [^1119Amky]. Regarding blood pressure, pooled analyses suggest modest systolic reductions with incretin-based therapies, with some indication that dual agonists may lower systolic blood pressure more than GLP-1 RAs versus insulin comparators, but head-to-head class comparisons are limited and certainty varies, so I should be cautious in overinterpreting this [^116qMgeJ]. Cardiovascular safety for tirzepatide appears reassuring, with no excess MACE signal versus comparators in pooled analyses and ongoing outcomes trials underway to confirm event reduction, mirroring the established CV benefits seen with several GLP-1 RAs [^115oh8ff] [^112uj7jv].

> Now, I should review tolerability and discontinuation. Gastrointestinal adverse events are the predominant class effect, typically occurring during dose escalation and diminishing over time; tirzepatide shows dose-dependent increases in nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, with nausea rates around 32–44% across 5–15 mg doses, higher than some GLP-1 RAs but qualitatively similar in pattern and generally mild-to-moderate [^1114hXc5] [^112LVHVu]. Hold on, I should verify discontinuation rates. Real-world cohorts report 20–50% discontinuation within the first year for GLP-1 RAs and dual agonists, largely driven by GI intolerance and cost/access issues, underscoring the need for slow titration, anticipatory guidance, and adherence support [^115aKutV] [^113GwpK6]. Interestingly, systematic analyses suggest that greater therapeutic efficacy does not necessarily correlate with higher GI AE rates across incretin agents, implying that tirzepatide's superior efficacy is not solely explained by more GI adverse effects, though patient-level susceptibility varies [^112s3SRJ] [^116xhTLA].

> I should confirm hypoglycemia risk and other safety signals. Because both GLP-1 and GIP effects are glucose-dependent, hypoglycemia risk is low unless combined with insulin or sulfonylureas, and severe hypoglycemia was not increased in tirzepatide trials, consistent with the class profile [^1114hXc5] [^115oh8ff]. Long-term safety through 240 weeks appears acceptable without new safety signals, though continued pharmacovigilance is prudent, particularly for pancreatitis and neoplasia where signals remain theoretical rather than established in humans [^112NUj4f] [^114e6eoT]. I should double-check contraindications: personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN2 remains a class contraindication, and patients should be screened accordingly [^11481Qjp].

> Next, I should review guideline positioning and real-world effectiveness. ADA 2025 recommends GLP-1 RAs or dual GIP/GLP-1 RAs as preferred injectables over insulin in most adults with T2D without insulin deficiency, and supports combination with insulin when insulin is indicated for added glycemic, weight, and hypoglycemia benefits, with regular reassessment to avoid therapeutic inertia [^114HqfbD] [^115C63cJ] [^112KqxYW]. AACE 2023 similarly elevates GLP-1 RAs and dual agonists early in the algorithm, particularly when weight loss and cardiometabolic risk reduction are priorities [^113pCAf6]. Real-world data show that while effectiveness is generally lower than in trials, highly adherent patients can approach trial-level outcomes, highlighting the importance of persistence, dose optimization, and access solutions [^115aKutV] [^113GwpK6].

> But wait, what about uncertainties and practical trade-offs. Mechanistically, the incremental benefit of GIP co-agonism is compelling yet incompletely defined in humans, and ongoing research is clarifying receptor pharmacology and tissue-specific effects that could refine patient selection and expectations [^116PkAw6]. Cost and access remain major barriers to sustained use, and early discontinuation blunts realized benefits; shared decision-making should incorporate affordability, comorbidities, and patient goals, with proactive management of GI effects to preserve adherence [^115aKutV] [^113GwpK6]. I should also note that while dual agonists outperform GLP-1 RAs on average, individual variability is substantial, and some patients may achieve excellent outcomes with GLP-1 RAs alone, so therapy should be individualized and reassessed every 3–6 months per guideline principles [^112KqxYW].

> In summary, I need to ensure the conclusion aligns with the totality of evidence. Dual GIP/GLP-1 agonism with tirzepatide provides superior HbA1c lowering, greater weight loss, and promising hepatic and cardiometabolic effects compared with GLP-1 RAs, at the expense of somewhat higher GI adverse event rates that are manageable with slow titration and patient counseling; overall safety is acceptable and guideline-endorsed, with the strongest support for use in patients with T2D, obesity, or high cardiometabolic risk where weight loss and glycemic potency are paramount [^1114hXc5] [^115oh8ff] [^114HqfbD] [^113pCAf6]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal replacement of GLP-1 RAs; GLP-1 RAs remain highly effective, sometimes better tolerated in sensitive patients, and may be preferred based on access, prior response, or comorbidity profile, so comparative effectiveness should be framed as average superiority with patient-specific tailoring rather than a one-size-fits-all mandate [^1172LVDm] [^115aKutV].

---

GIP1-based therapies (notably tirzepatide) **outperform GLP-1 receptor agonists** for glycemic control and weight loss, achieving ~2.0–2.6% HbA1c reductions and 15–20% weight loss in T2D/obesity trials [^1114hXc5] [^115oh8ff] [^113tAEne]. They also show **greater liver fat reduction** in MAFLD/MASH, with ~2.9-fold larger effects than GLP-1 RAs [^112pbhNr] [^115ZLPBL]. Gastrointestinal side effects are **more frequent and persistent** with dual agonists, especially early in therapy, but serious adverse events are comparable and hypoglycemia risk remains low unless combined with insulin or sulfonylureas [^112LVHVu] [^112NUj4f]. Dual agonists are preferred when maximal glycemic/weight loss or liver benefits are prioritized; GLP-1 RAs remain appropriate when tolerability or cost is the priority.

---

## Mechanisms of action

GLP-1 receptor agonists mimic GLP-1 to **enhance glucose-dependent insulin secretion**, suppress glucagon, slow gastric emptying, and reduce appetite, thereby improving glycemic control and promoting weight loss [^114bHvUS]. GIP1-based therapies (e.g. tirzepatide) **co-activate GIP and GLP-1 receptors**, leveraging complementary pathways that enhance insulin secretion, improve insulin sensitivity, and amplify appetite suppression, yielding greater metabolic effects than GLP-1 agonists alone [^1114hXc5] [^115oh8ff].

---

## Glycemic control

- **HbA1c reduction**: Dual agonists achieve greater HbA1c reductions (~2.0–2.6%) than GLP-1 RAs (~1.0–1.8%) in T2D trials [^1114hXc5] [^115oh8ff] [^114ZU3D9].

- **Fasting glucose**: Greater fasting plasma glucose reductions are observed with dual agonists versus GLP-1 RAs [^1114hXc5].

- **Insulin sensitivity**: Dual agonists improve insulin sensitivity more than GLP-1 RAs, contributing to superior glycemic control [^115oh8ff].

---

## Weight loss

- **Magnitude**: Dual agonists produce greater weight loss (~15–20%) than GLP-1 RAs (~10–15%) in obesity/T2D trials [^113tAEne] [^111cpo2m] [^114vYeLM].

- **Dose-response**: Weight loss with tirzepatide is dose-dependent and exceeds semaglutide at comparable doses [^1114hXc5] [^113tAEne].

- **Mechanisms**: Enhanced appetite suppression and metabolic effects from dual receptor activation drive greater weight loss [^112AAPVj] [^113ASiSE].

---

## Hepatic outcomes

In MAFLD/MASH, dual agonists demonstrate **greater liver fat reduction (~2.9-fold vs GLP-1 RAs)** and larger improvements in ALT/AST, with long-term therapy (> 48 weeks) showing fibrosis-related benefits [^112pbhNr] [^115ZLPBL] [^1119Amky]. GLP-1 RAs improve steatosis and inflammation but have **less pronounced effects on fibrosis** than dual agonists [^1119Amky] [^112pbhNr].

---

## Cardiovascular outcomes

GLP-1 RAs have **established cardiovascular benefits** (reduced MACE) in high-risk T2D patients [^112uj7jv]. Dual agonists show promising cardiovascular safety and favorable risk factor modification, but **long-term outcome data are pending** [^115oh8ff] [^114zGqGQ].

---

## Safety and tolerability

- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are more frequent and persistent with dual agonists, especially early in therapy, but are generally mild-to-moderate and improve over time [^112LVHVu] [^112NUj4f].

- **Serious adverse events**: Rates are comparable to GLP-1 RAs, with no new safety signals identified to date [^112LVHVu] [^112NUj4f].

- **Hypoglycemia**: Risk remains low unless combined with insulin or sulfonylureas [^117DKbij].

---

## Patient-reported outcomes

Quality of life improves with both classes as weight and glycemic control improve, though **early GI effects** can transiently reduce quality of life before improving as adverse events abate [^112NUj4f]. GLP-1 RAs may be better tolerated in patients with significant GI sensitivity or those prioritizing tolerability [^112NUj4f].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines prioritize GLP-1 RAs or dual agonists for T2D with obesity or cardiovascular risk, with **dual agonists favored** when greater glycemic/weight loss or liver benefits are desired [^111Q9UN7] [^113phPfP] [^113pCAf6] [^1113efYD]. Selection should be individualized based on comorbidities, tolerability, and patient preferences [^113q3f1E] [^115z8u9n].

Long-term safety profile

Studies with extended follow-up periods, ranging up to 240 weeks, continued to demonstrate acceptable safety profiles without emergence of new safety signals during prolonged treatment exposure (Table 2). Quality-of-life measures showed initial transient reductions coinciding with peak adverse event frequency, followed by recovery or improvement by study completion as adverse event rates diminished and therapeutic benefits became established.

Comparative safety: mono versus dual receptor agonists

Dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists were associated with higher overall adverse event rates and treatment discontinuations compared to single GLP-1 receptor agonists, primarily attributable to more frequent and persistent gastrointestinal symptoms during initial treatment periods (Table 2). However, serious adverse event rates remained comparable between mono and dual agonist approaches, suggesting that while tolerability may be reduced with dual agonists, the fundamental safety profile remains acceptable. Despite higher initial adverse event rates, treatment adherence remained satisfactory across studies, and most participants who continued treatment beyond the initial titration period experienced resolution or substantial improvement in gastrointestinal symptoms while maintaining therapeutic efficacy.

Sensitivity analysis

Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the findings across all outcomes through a leave-one-out meta-analysis, an examination of influential studies, and outlier detection (Supplementary Figures S2A-S2K). Most primary outcomes demonstrated robust results, with findings remaining stable, even when individual studies were sequentially removed from the analysis. For liver-related outcomes, the reductions in ALT and AST levels showed robust effects, despite considerable heterogeneity. Notably, Savvidou et al. and Feng et al. were identified as the most influential studies for these outcomes. Additionally, reductions in liver fat content remained significant across sensitivity analyses, although eight studies were identified as statistical outliers, primarily those with larger effect sizes. However, several outcomes showed sensitivity to specific studies. For instance, liver stiffness was sensitive to the findings of Loomba et al. HOMA-IR was influenced by Guo et al. and fasting glucose levels were affected by Smits et al. Changes in body weight showed the highest variability, with 16 studies identified as outliers, reflecting substantial heterogeneity in weight responses across different populations and intervention protocols. An assessment of publication bias using Egger's test revealed minimal asymmetry for most primary outcomes. Some evidence of bias was detected only for AST levels and waist circumference measurements.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of currently approved incretin mimetics: a systematic analysis of placebo-controlled clinical trials [^114ZU3D9]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Incretin mimetics are glucose‐lowering medications widely used for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), originally developed based on the glucose‐ and weight‐reducing effects of glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1). The newest addition to this class is tirzepatide, the first unimolecular co‐agonist acting on both GLP‐1 and glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors. While the additive effect of GIP receptor agonism is still being explored, newer incretin mimetics generally show greater reductions in HbA1c and body weight compared with GLP‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1 RAs) developed earlier.

Head‐to‐head comparisons, and network meta‐analyses, have shown significant variations in the efficacy of the incretin mimetics in reducing HbA 1c, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and body weight reductions, which have informed their differential use based on individual patient needs. However, another important consideration that influences the selection of these agents is the risk for adverse events (AEs), particularly gastrointestinal (GI) side effects such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Potential differences in the GI AEs and their relationship with therapeutic efficacy across trials have not received the same attention and have not — so far — been systematically explored.

To address this knowledge gap, the current study compares therapeutic efficacy (i.e. effect size for intended therapeutic actions — HbA1c and body weight reduction), the risk of GI AE versus placebo treatment and their correlation across phase 3 and 4 randomized, placebo‐controlled clinical trials studying various incretin‐based glucose‐lowering agents used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Study limitations and methodological considerations

Several limitations need to be acknowledged in interpreting these findings. First, the diagnostic criteria for MAFLD varied across studies, with the majority relying on imaging-based assessments rather than histological confirmation. While this approach reflects real-world clinical practice, it may have introduced heterogeneity in baseline disease severity and therapeutic response assessment. Second, the relatively short follow-up periods in most included studies (median: 24 weeks) may have been insufficient to capture the full spectrum of hepatic benefits, particularly regarding improvements in fibrosis. The dramatic effects observed in long-term studies suggest that future research should prioritise extended treatment durations to evaluate therapeutic potential. Third, the inclusion of diverse GLP-1 receptor agonist formulations and dosing regimens may have contributed to the observed heterogeneity. While this approach provides broad applicability, it complicates direct comparisons between specific agents and optimal dosing strategies.

The findings of this analysis highlight several critical areas for future research. First, dedicated long-term trials (2 years or more) evaluating dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists in biopsy-confirmed MASH populations are needed to definitively establish their role in fibrosis regression and the prevention of clinical outcomes. Second, comparative effectiveness research directly comparing different GLP-1 receptor agonists and dual agonists within the same study population would provide valuable guidance for clinical decision-making. The emergence of triple agonists (GLP-1/GIP/glucagon) and novel combination therapies adds additional complexity to this therapeutic landscape. Third, the development of biomarkers to predict treatment response and optimise patient selection represents a critical unmet need. The variable responses observed across patient subgroups suggest that personalised medicine approaches may enhance therapeutic outcomes while minimising unnecessary exposure in non-responders.

Furthermore, the results of this meta-analysis have immediate implications for clinical practice. For patients with MAFLD and concurrent type 2 diabetes or obesity, GLP-1 receptor agonists represent evidence-based therapeutic options that can simultaneously address multiple disease components. The superior efficacy of dual agonists, while promising, must be balanced against potential increased adverse events and higher costs. The duration-dependent response pattern emphasises the importance of long-term treatment commitment and appropriate patient counselling regarding realistic timeframes for hepatic improvement. Clinicians should consider treatment duration as a critical factor in therapeutic planning, recognising that maximum hepatic benefits may require extended therapy.

Overview of glp-1/GIP pharmacotherapy

GLP-1 receptor agonists have become much more widespread in recent years likely due to their weight loss benefits. The latest addition to this class is tirzepatide, US Food and Drug Administration approved in May 2022. It targets GLP-1 and GIP receptors and has been shown to be superior to GLP-1 receptor agonists in glycaemic management and weight loss.

GLP-1 and GIP are incretin hormones released from the gut in response to food intake. They stimulate insulin secretion, particularly after meals, and suppress the release of glucagon — a hormone that raises BG levels. Both hormones also slow gastric emptying, promoting a feeling of fullness that contributes to lower calorie intake and weight loss. They also act on the brain to regulate appetite and satiety, supporting long-term weight management.

When choosing an incretin-based therapy, several factors should be considered. These factors are influenced by the patient's individual health needs, preferences and circumstances, as well as the specific characteristics of the available therapies (online supplemental figure 1).

### Comparison of efficacy between incretin-based therapies for type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113Jscfq]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus is widely prevalent and is often coexistent with obesity. Many of the available treatment options have side effects such as weight gain which often affect patient's willingness to continue the treatment. Effective weight loss, lack of significant hypoglycaemia, and favourable cardiometabolic profile make Incretin based therapies an attractive treatment option for type 2 diabetes. Incretin based therapies are available as either incretin mimetics (also called GLP-1 agonists) or incretin enhancers (DPP-4 inhibitors). Although agents in both these classes of incretin based therapy are effective through a common GLP-1 pathway, there are many differences amongst them including the route of administration, frequency of administration, effects on body weight, extent of glycaemic improvement. There are several trials evaluating these individual incretin based agents either as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-diabetic agents, however very few have looked into direct comparison amongst the agents in these two classes. This review is aimed to look at important mechanistic differences between incretin mimetics and enhancers through direct comparison trials and impact of these differences on biochemical, metabolic and patient satisfaction parameters.

### Meta-analysis of head-to-head clinical trials comparing incretin-based glucose-lowering medications and basal insulin: an update including recently developed glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide / GLP-1 receptor co-agonist tirzepatide [^117DKbij]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To assess comparative efficacy, safety and tolerability of injectable incretin-based glucose-lowering medications (IBGLMs) versus basal insulin treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes.

Research Design and Methods

We performed an updated meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of head-to-head comparisons of IBGLMs (short- and long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1] receptor agonists [GLP-1RAs] and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide [GIP]/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist tirzepatide) versus basal insulin using a PubMed database search (April 2022). The primary endpoint was difference in reduction of glycated haemoglobin (HbA 1c) versus baseline between pooled IBGLMs (fixed-effects meta-analysis) and their subgroups (random-effects meta-analysis) versus basal insulin treatment (mean differences). Secondary endpoints were fasting plasma glucose, body weight, HbA 1c target achievement, hypoglycaemia, blood pressure and lipids. Risk of bias assessment was performed using Jadad scores and the Risk of Bias tool 2.0.

Results

In all, 20 studies, representing 47 study arms and 11843 patients, were eligible. Compared with basal insulin, IGBLMs lowered HbA 1c by 0.48 (0.45–0.52)% more than did basal insulin treatment. This effect was driven by pooled long-acting GLP-1RAs (ΔHbA 1c -0.25 [-0.38; -0.11]%) and the only GIP/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist, tirzepatide (pooled doses; ΔHbA 1c -0.90 [-1.06; -0.75]%), while short-acting GLP-1RAs were equally effective compared with basal insulin (P = 0.90). All IBGLM subgroups achieved significantly lower body weight versus insulin treatment (-4.6 [-4.7; -4.4] kg), in particular tirzepatide (-12.0 [-13.8; -10.1] kg). IBGLMs significantly reduced hypoglycaemia and blood pressure and improved lipid variables. Risk of bias was low. IBGLM treatment was associated with more nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea and study medication discontinuation.

Conclusions

Recently introduced, highly effective IBGLMs were superior to basal insulin treatment, reinforcing the recommendation that IBGLMs should be considered as the first injectable treatment for most patients with type 2 diabetes.

Statistical analysis

For continuous outcomes, effect sizes were calculated as mean differences (MD) when outcomes were measured on identical scales across studies or standardised mean differences (SMD) when studies used different measurement scales or units. All effect size calculations were performed using end-of-treatment values.

Random-effects models were employed as the primary analysis approach, acknowledging expected clinical and methodological heterogeneity across included studies due to variations in patient populations (diabetes status, disease severity), intervention characteristics (drug type, dosage, duration), and study settings. Pooled effect estimates are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI) and considered statistically significant when p < 0.05.

Statistical heterogeneity was quantified using the I² statistic. The χ² test for heterogeneity was also performed, with p < 0.05 indicating significant heterogeneity. Furthermore, Funnel plot asymmetry was assessed visually and statistically tested using Egger test, with p < 0.05 suggesting potential publication bias.

Subgroup analysis

Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore sources of heterogeneity and identify populations with differential treatment responses. Subgroup variables included: age (under 55 years, 55–65 years, over 65 year), intervention characteristics (drug type [single GLP-1 agonist vs. dual agonist], treatment duration (Short-term (24 weeks or less), Medium-term (25–48 weeks), Long-term (over 48 weeks)), and control type (placebo, lifestyle modification, active comparator).

Sensitivity analysis approach

Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of findings by implementing several strategies. These included excluding studies with a high risk of bias, removing studies with extreme outlier results, using alternative effect size measures (e.g. SMD vs. MD), excluding studies that contained imputed data, limiting analysis to studies with specific participant characteristics (e.g. diabetes status), and using alternative meta-analysis methods (fixed versus. random effects). The results were considered robust if the conclusions remained unchanged across these sensitivity analyses.

### Early combination therapy with SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA or dual GIP / GLP-1 RA in type 2 diabetes [^117Nuoca]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-Like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) are recommended in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) for glycaemic control and for people with high cardiovascular risk. However, current guidelines do not specifically address the role of initial early combination therapy with SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA or dual gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1 RA, but rather sequential initiation with either in T2D. This review synthesizes the available evidence on the use of SGLT2i and GLP-1-based therapies for T2D and provides a rationale for their combination. The combination of SGLT2i with GLP-1-based therapies addresses complementary pathophysiological mechanisms and enhances efficacy in achieving target haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) levels. SGLT2i and GLP-1 RA also have been shown to prevent complications of T2D. While both classes reduce adverse cardiorenal events, SGLT2i has a predominant effect on prevention of kidney dysfunction and heart failure, whereas GLP-1 RA has a more marked effect on the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Both drug classes have favourable safety profiles. Finally, weight loss with combination therapy may have disease-modifying effects that may reverse T2D progression. We propose that the combination of SGLT2i with GLP-1 RA or dual GIP/GLP-1 RA should be considered for most patients with T2D who do not have contraindications.

### Incretin-based therapies: viewpoints on the way to consensus [^1147CwXH]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Mechanistic studies have suggested cardio-protective activity of GLP-1. Similar effects may be present with GLP-1 receptor agonists. Clinical trials have shown effects of exenatide and liraglutide on surrogate cardiovascular parameters such as systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, and brain natriuretic peptide. Long-term studies proving cardiovascular benefit are necessary for both incretin mimetics and DPP-4 inhibitors.

Besides their positive therapeutic effects, incretin-based therapies offer advantages over traditional oral agents and insulin, in terms of both convenience and reduced side effects, especially with regard to the expected frequency of hypoglycemia and weight gain. Based on these important properties, GLP-1 receptor agonists have been mentioned in recent treatment algorithms for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, however, as less validated therapy.

What information is currently lacking but would be needed for an unequivocal recommendation? (by S.M.)

Choosing antihyperglycemic agents is determined by their efficacy in lowering blood glucose and their extraglycemic effects (including effects on cardiovascular disease and microangiopathy), adverse events, and costs. GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors are relatively novel classes of drugs. To unequivocally recommend these two new drug types, the following information is lacking and should be provided: 1) Current data on the durability of glycemic control are insufficient, 2) the durability and magnitude of weight regulation are currently unknown, 3) neither GLP-1 receptor agonists nor DPP-4 inhibitors have been investigated in trials of sufficient size and duration to evaluate their effects on cardiovascular outcomes, and 4) long-term trials on safety with prospective collection of adverse events are needed over and above what has been reported so far.

Safety profile

GLP-1 receptor agonists and dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists demonstrated acceptable safety profiles across all 26 studies encompassing 3,453 participants (Table 2). While overall adverse event rates were higher compared to placebo controls, serious adverse events were infrequent and occurred at comparable frequencies between active treatments and controls. No treatment-related deaths were reported across any of the included studies.

Table 2
Safety outcomes across included studies

AEs adverse events, GI gastrointestinal, SAEs serious adverse events

Data presented as available from individual studies. Not all studies reported quantitative rates for all safety outcomes

Gastrointestinal adverse events represented the most frequent class-specific side effects, reported consistently across studies investigating both mono and dual receptor agonists (Table 2). Nausea emerged as the most reported adverse event, with quantifiable rates available from 17 studies (65.4% of included studies). The incidence of nausea demonstrated clear dose-dependent relationships and varied significantly by therapeutic agent. Among semaglutide studies, nausea rates ranged from 30.3% to 45% in treatment groups compared to 9.1% to 17% in placebo groups. Liraglutide studies reported nausea in 25.8% to 46% of participants, with most investigations documenting transient symptoms during dose escalation phases. Dual agonist studies revealed higher nausea incidence, particularly with survodutide (66% vs. 23% placebo) and cotadutide (ranging from 53.8% to 83.3% across dose levels vs. 12.5% placebo). Tirzepatide demonstrated dose-dependent nausea rates of 32% (5 mg), 44% (10 mg), and 41% (15 mg) compared to 12% with placebo. Additional gastrointestinal symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhea, and constipation, followed similar patterns, typically manifesting during initial dose escalation and diminishing with continued treatment. Notably, constipation was reported in 22% of semaglutide-treated participants versus 12% receiving placebo in the largest included study.

Future research

Long-term efficacy and safety

The long-term effects of GLP-1 RA use for weight loss remains an important area for future research. While current studies have demonstrated substantial short-term weight loss and metabolic improvements, the sustainability of these outcomes over extended periods requires further exploration. Longitudinal studies should investigate how these agents impact long-term health outcomes, such as the incidence of cardiovascular diseases and mortality. Additionally, long-term safety needs to be established. Comprehensive long-term studies will help clarify the risk-benefit ratio of prolonged GLP-1 RA therapy.

Oral formulations

The development of oral GLP-1 RAs offers an alternative to injectable formulations, potentially improving access and adherence for some patients. Oral semaglutide has demonstrated efficacy in both diabetes and obesity management. Cardiovascular safety was first established in the PIONEER 6 trial, with the more recent SOUL trial demonstrating a significant reduction in MACE compared to placebo among individuals with type 2 diabetes and high cardiovascular or renal risk. These findings support the potential of oral semaglutide for broader clinical use. Orforglipron, a novel non-peptide oral GLP-1 RA, has also shown promising glycemic and weight-lowering effects in phase 2 trials. While oral formulations have demonstrated acceptable tolerability overall, gastrointestinal side effects remain common and may occur at similar or slightly higher rates than with injectable agents. Daily dosing and pill burden may also pose practical challenges in long-term use, highlighting the need to tailor treatment choices to individual patient needs and preferences.

Combination therapies

Combination therapies represent a promising strategy to enhance the efficacy and tolerability of GLP-1 RAs. Several novel agents now combine GLP-1 receptor agonism with other metabolic targets. Dual agonists such as tirzepatide (GLP-1/GIP) have demonstrated superior weight loss and glycemic control compared to GLP-1 RAs alone, likely due to complementary mechanisms involving both incretin pathways. Triple agonists that target GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon receptors, such as retatrutide, are also in development and have shown even greater weight loss effects in early-phase trials. Other potential combinations include GLP-1 RAs with SGLT-2 inhibitors, amylin analogs, or central nervous system appetite modulators, such as phentermine or bupropion. These combination therapies could provide synergistic effects on weight loss, glycemic control, or cardiometabolic risk while potentially minimizing the gastrointestinal side effects commonly associated with GLP-1 RAs. Future studies should also explore optimal sequencing, dosing strategies, and patient selection to maximize clinical benefit.

### What is the pipeline for future medications for obesity? [^113ASiSE]. International Journal of Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

GIP agonism

GIP is secreted by K-cells in jejunum in response to food intake and its physiological role includes stimulation of insulin secretion, increased glucagon secretion, increased lipogenesis and enhancement of lipid buffering capacity (Fig. 1). In the context of T2D, the ability of GIP to stimulate insulin secretion and to ameliorate glycaemia is impaired.

Studies in animal models have shown an anorexigenic action of GIP receptor agonism and a recent phase 1 clinical trial with a long-acting GIP RA found that repeated dosing for 4 weeks induced modest WL (−1.9 to −3.1 kg vs. −0.4 kg with placebo) in people with T2D, without delay in gastric emptying or nausea and vomiting.

Nevertheless, as the simultaneous activation of GLP-1 and GIP receptors in preclinical models results in greater WL and glucose-lowering efficacy compared to activation of each receptor alone, the interest for the development of unimolecular GLP-1 and GIP RA was increased, despite that this additive effect in food intake and glycaemia was not observed in some acute clinical studies.

### Efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists and dual GLP-1 / GIP receptor agonists in managing MALFD: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112pbhNr]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This comprehensive meta-analysis of 26 RCTs encompassing 3,453 participants provides the most robust evidence supporting GLP-1 receptor agonist efficacy in managing MAFLD. Significant and clinically meaningful improvements were demonstrated across multiple hepatic and metabolic parameters, with superior therapeutic efficacy observed for dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists compared to single GLP-1 receptor agonists. Most notably, a remarkable 2.9-fold greater efficacy for liver fat reduction was achieved with dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists compared to single agonists, positioning these therapies as potentially transformative interventions. Furthermore, duration-dependent response patterns were identified, demonstrating that long-term therapy exceeding 48 weeks is required for optimal outcomes, including significant improvements in liver stiffness and fibrosis markers. This finding emphasises the chronic nature of MAFLD, requiring sustained therapeutic intervention like other metabolic disorders. Important patient-specific response patterns were revealed, with the most comprehensive therapeutic benefits demonstrated in younger patients (below 55 years). These findings position GLP-1 receptor agonists as valuable therapeutic tools in the evolving landscape of MAFLD management, while highlighting the need for continued research to optimise treatment protocols and patient selection strategies.

### Compounded GLP-1 and dual GIP / GLP-1 receptor agonists: a statement from the American diabetes association [^117XHAa8]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

The use of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) and dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 RA (GIP/GLP-1 RA) classes has increased substantially over the past several years for treating type 2 diabetes and obesity. Increased demand for these pharmacotherapies has resulted in temporary product shortages for both GLP-1 RA and dual GIP/GLP-1 RA medications. These shortages, in part, have led to entities producing and marketing compounded formulations that bypass regulatory measures, raising safety, quality, and efficacy concerns. Even as shortages resolve, compounded GLP-1 RA and GIP/GLP-1 RA products continue to be heavily marketed to people with diabetes and obesity. The purpose of this statement by the American Diabetes Association is to guide health care professionals and people with diabetes and/or obesity in these circumstances of medication unavailability to promote optimal care and medication use safety.

Current and emerging strategies to therapeutically target weight management include pairing agonism of the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) with either agonism or antagonism of the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR). On the surface, these two approaches seem contradictory, yet they have produced similar effects for weight loss in clinical studies. Arguments that support the rationale for both approaches are made in these point-counterpoint articles, founded on preclinical studies, human genetics, and clinical outcomes. Here, we attempt to reconcile how two opposing approaches can produce similar effects on body weight by evaluating the leading hypotheses derived from the available evidence.

Certainty of the evidence assessment

We will follow the GRADE approach for assessing the certainty of the evidence using the GRADEpro GDT software and according to the guidelines provided in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We will use the five GRADE considerations (overall risk of bias, consistency of effect, imprecision, indirectness, and publication bias) to assess the certainty of the body of evidence for blood pressure, withdrawal due to adverse effects and serious adverse events as follows.

Prioritized comparison: dual GIP/GLP‐1 receptor agonists class versus GLP‐1 receptor agonists class
Blood pressure outcomes hierarchized as follows: short‐term systolic blood pressure, short‐term diastolic blood pressure, medium‐term systolic blood pressure, medium‐term diastolic blood pressure
Safety outcomes: withdrawals due to adverse effects and serious adverse events

The GRADE system uses the following criteria for assigning a grade for the certainty of evidence.

High certainty: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect.
Moderate certainty: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.
Low certainty: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited; the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect.
Very low certainty: we have very little confidence in the effect estimate; the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect.

Two review authors (GG and AG) will independently judge the certainty of evidence. We will resolve any disagreements by discussion or by consulting a third review author (JMW). We will include justified, documented, and incorporated judgments into the reporting of results for each outcome using footnotes to aid the reader's understanding. We will present the findings of the review in a summary of findings table.

Consumer involvement

This review will be focused on blood pressure, an outcome that is commonly used as a target in worldwide clinical practice, and patients and the public are familiar with. We will prepare a clearly written plain language summary, so that patients can understand why it should matter to them that we have written this review. We will involve patients and the public in assessing the readability of the plain language summary.

### Efficacy of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists compared to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors for the management of type 2 diabetes: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^112Bj4Mi]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Aims

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are both incretin-based therapies for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) but have distinct efficacy and side effect profiles. We thus performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the effects of GLP-1 agonists to DPP-4 inhibitors on glycaemic control, weight and incidence of adverse events in adults with T2DM. We also sought to determine whether there was any additional effect in switching from DPP-4 inhibitor to GLP-1 agonist.

Materials and Methods

We systematically searched PubMed, Embase and ClinicalTrials.gov for (1) randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any GLP-1 agonist to any DPP-4 inhibitor and (2) interventional studies where a DPP-4 inhibitor was switched to a GLP-1 agonist. We assessed pooled data using random-effects model (CRD42017057115).

Results

The pooled analysis of 13 RCTs (n = 4330) showed that, compared to DPP-4 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists yielded a greater mean reduction in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) of -0.41% (95% CI -0.53 to -0.30) and in weight of -2.15kg (-3.04 to -1.27). GLP-1 agonists were associated with greater likelihood of gastrointestinal side effects with no increased risk of hypoglycaemia. In 5 interventional studies (n = 433), switching from DPP-4 inhibitor to GLP-1 agonist yielded further mean reduction in HbA1c of -0.69% (-1.03 to -0.35) and in weight of -2.25kg (-3.12 to -1.38).

Conclusions

GLP-1 agonists yield greater reduction in HbA1c and weight as compared to DPP-4 inhibitors, with increased incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms but not hypoglycaemia. Replacing a DPP-4 inhibitor with GLP-1 agonist provides additional benefits in glycaemic control and weight loss.

### What is the 'real-world' experience with fixed-ratio combination therapy (insulin + GLP-1 receptor agonist) in routine clinical practice? Take-home messages for clinicians regarding key outcomes [^113phPfP]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Head‐to‐head real‐world comparisons suggest that both IDegLira and iGlarLixi are effective and well tolerated. IDegLira may offer advantages in weight reduction and dose efficiency, while iGlarLixi may provide additional postprandial glucose control in selected populations. These findings suggest that both options can be tailored to individual patient needs and baseline characteristics.

Despite the strengths of this RWE, limitations must be acknowledged. Most studies were observational, introducing the potential for selection bias, unmeasured confounding and variable definitions of outcomes. Follow‐up durations were often limited, and direct comparisons with other intensification or simplification strategies remain scarce. Nevertheless, the consistency of RWE findings with those from RCTs reinforces the external validity of clinical trial outcomes and underscores the practical applicability of FRCs in diverse, real‐world clinical settings.

8.2 Clinical considerations and recommendations

Integrating these findings into clinical practice requires careful patient selection, consideration of alternative therapeutic options, and an individualized, person‐centred approach to therapy selection. Key considerations include:

8.3 Cardiovascular risk and weight management

For patients where cardiovascular risk reduction and/or weight loss are primary goals, initiating therapy with a long‐acting, once‐weekly GLP‐1 RA or dual GIP/GLP‐1 RA is generally recommended. These agents have demonstrated significant glucose‐lowering effects, weight loss benefits and cardiovascular advantages, making them preferable to FRCs for patients inadequately controlled on OADs alone or those intensifying from basal insulin ± OADs in whom cardiovascular risk reduction and/or weight loss are significant treatment goals.

8.4 Severe Hyperglycaemia and/or Insulin Deficiency

In patients with significant hyperglycaemia (with or without symptoms of insulin deficiency), or in those whose primary pathophysiologic defect is insulin deficiency (often non‐obese individuals), FRCs offer an effective therapeutic approach. These patients require rapid glycaemic improvement, best achieved with insulin therapy. FRCs provide both the insulin component and a GLP‐1 RA, enhancing glucose control without increasing hypoglycaemia risk. Non‐obese, insulin‐deficient patients, who may not require or desire significant weight loss, may particularly benefit from FRC therapy.

### Evaluation and comparison of efficacy and safety of tirzepatide, liraglutide and SGLT2i in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a network meta-analysis [^1172LVDm]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2024). Medium credibility.

While prior studies, including those by Ding et al. Guan et al. and Thomas et al. have analyzed specific hypoglycemic agents or focused on single drug classes, our study offers a comprehensive network meta-analysis that compares three major classes of antidiabetic medications — GLP-1 receptor agonists, GIP/GLP-1 dual receptor agonists, and SGLT-2 inhibitors — within a unified analytical framework. This approach enables both direct and indirect comparisons of efficacy and safety outcomes, including HbA1c reduction, weight loss, blood pressure control, and adverse events, across a broad spectrum of drug dosages. Unlike previous studies, which often emphasize pharmacokinetic or mechanistic insights, our analysis is guided by clinical relevance, addressing the practical application of these therapies in managing Type 2 diabetes, particularly in patients with comorbid conditions such as obesity and hypertension. Through the evaluation of these therapies according to their efficacy and safety profiles, our findings offer critical insights to evidence-based guidelines, equipping clinicians with a more nuanced understanding of optimal therapy selections and potential combinations for tailored patient management.

The comparative effectiveness and safety of these three drug classes have not been thoroughly assessed in relation to each other, given their distinct mechanisms of action. Network meta-analysis (NMA) serves as an ideal statistical approach to address this gap. As a method that allows for the simultaneous comparison and ranking of multiple interventions through both direct and indirect evidence, NMAs consolidate findings from multiple comparators into a single pooled analysis. Consequently, our study employs NMA to evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of the GIP/GLP-1 dual receptor agonist tirzepatide (TIR), the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide (LIR), and various SGLT-2 inhibitors, including canagliflozin (Can), ertugliflozin (Ert), empagliflozin (Emp), dapagliflozin (Dap), and henagliflozin (Hen), in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Our goal is to provide evidence-based insights that can assist clinicians in formulating optimal hypoglycemic regimens.

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of currently approved incretin mimetics: a systematic analysis of placebo-controlled clinical trials [^112s3SRJ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

This study compares the therapeutic efficacy, gastrointestinal (GI) adverse event (AE) rates and the relationship between the therapeutic efficacy and GI AEs in randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of GLP-1 RAs and the dual GLP-1/GIP agonist tirzepatide.

Materials and Methods

A systematic PubMed search identified 38 phase 3 or 4 placebo-controlled RCTs of exenatide (b.i.d. and q.w.), lixisenatide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, albiglutide, semaglutide (s.c. and oral) and tirzepatide with a total of 16660 individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) across 104 study arms. Changes in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose and body weight and the proportion of GI AEs (nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea) were calculated by agent, preparation and dose. The correlation between odds ratios (ORs) for GI AEs and the magnitude of therapeutic efficacy was assessed in a linear regression analysis.

Results

Baseline characteristics were similar across studies: mean age 57 ± 10years, diabetes duration 8 ± 6years, body mass index (BMI) 31.9 ± 5.8kg/m 2 and HbA1c 8.2% ± 0.9%. HbA1c reductions ranged from -0.63% ± 0.03% (lixisenatide, 20μg q.d.) to -1.79% ± 0.09% (tirzepatide, 15mg q.w.; p < 0.0001). Weight reductions ranged from -0.75 ± 0.10kg to -9.65 ± 0.56kg. Despite the high variability in therapeutic efficacy, ORs for GI AEs were similar across compounds/preparations.

Conclusions

The magnitude of efficacy for intended therapeutic actions (HbA1c and body weight reduction) varied widely between incretin mimetic glucose-lowering agents. However, larger therapeutic efficacy was not systematically associated with higher GI AE or drug discontinuation rates, indicating better tolerability of the more effective agents/preparations.

### Efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists and dual GLP-1 / GIP receptor agonists in managing MALFD: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1119Amky]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This systematic review and meta-analysis, encompassing 26 RCTs, provides the most comprehensive evidence to date regarding the efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists in managing MAFLD. The findings demonstrate significant therapeutic benefits across various hepatic and metabolic parameters, particularly highlighting the superior efficacy of dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists compared to mono GLP-1 receptor agonists.

The primary hepatic outcomes revealed substantial improvements in liver fat content, ALT, and AST levels. However, measurement of liver stiffness did not demonstrate significant improvement, suggesting that while GLP-1 receptor agonists are effective in addressing hepatic steatosis and inflammation, their impact on established fibrosis may be limited or may require longer treatment durations.

Therapeutic superiority of dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists

The most clinically significant finding emerged from the subgroup analysis comparing dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists with mono GLP-1 receptor agonists. Dual agonists demonstrated markedly superior efficacy across hepatic parameters, with a 2.9-fold greater effect size for reducing liver fat content and substantially larger improvements in liver enzymes. This differential efficacy pattern aligns with recent mechanistic insights suggesting that GIP receptor activation provides complementary metabolic benefits beyond those offered by GLP-1 receptor stimulation alone. The synergistic effects of dual receptor activation can be attributed to distinct but complementary pathophysiological mechanisms. While GLP-1 receptor agonism primarily improves insulin sensitivity and reduces hepatic gluconeogenesis, GIP receptor activation enhances fatty acid oxidation and modulates adipose tissue function, potentially providing more hepatic protection. Furthermore, preclinical studies have demonstrated that dual agonists may exert direct anti-inflammatory effects on hepatocytes through pathways that are independent of weight loss, which could explain the observed superiority in liver-specific outcomes.

The duration-dependent analysis revealed a clear therapeutic hierarchy, with long-term treatment (greater than 48 weeks) demonstrating the most robust effects across all outcome measures. Remarkably, long-term treatment yielded the largest effect size for reducing liver fat content, accompanied by significant improvements in liver stiffness, an outcome not observed in shorter-duration studies. This finding challenges the current clinical practice of evaluating GLP-1 receptor agonist efficacy based on short- to medium-term outcomes, suggesting that sustained hepatic benefits may require extended treatment periods. The temporal pattern of therapeutic response appears to follow a biphasic model, with early metabolic improvements (such as glycaemic control and inflammatory markers) within the first 24 weeks, followed by progressive hepatic structural changes with longer treatment durations. This observation is consistent with the pathophysiological understanding that, while metabolic dysfunction can be rapidly corrected, hepatic remodelling and fibrosis regression require prolonged therapeutic intervention.

Target type comparison: mono GLP-1 versus dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists

Dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists demonstrated substantially greater efficacy in improving liver-specific parameters compared to mono GLP-1 receptor agonists. The most notable difference was observed in the reduction of liver fat content, where dual agonists demonstrated exceptional efficacy (MD = −7.15, 95% CI: −10.23 to −4.07, p < 0.0001, I² = 51%, n = 145) compared to mono GLP-1 receptor agonists (MD = −2.44, 95% CI: −4.18 to −0.71, p < 0.006, I² = 78%, n = 714) (Fig. 7 A). This represents a 2.9-fold greater effect size for dual agonists, suggesting superior resolution of hepatic steatosis. Additionally, dual agonists significantly improved liver stiffness (MD = −4.1, 95% CI: −5.87 to −2.33, p < 0.00001, I² = 0%, n = 96), whereas mono GLP-1 receptor agonists showed an increase in liver stiffness (MD = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.11 to 0.42, p = 0.0007, I² = 0%, n = 228) (Fig. 7 B).

### Review of head-to-head comparisons of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [^117C5WBY]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Structural differences between the various GLP‐1RAs result in unique clinical profiles; these treatments, therefore, differ from each other substantially with respect to glycaemic control, effects on weight, and safety and tolerability, as demonstrated in phase III head‐to‐head trials in T2D. These differences should be considered when selecting a GLP‐1RA for an individual patient. Patient preference should be an important element of the treatment decision. Data on patient preference for the GLP‐1RAs are currently limited, although glycaemic control and AEs are likely to be key factors 87.

The present review is limited by the small number of studies directly comparing the different GLP‐1RAs. Indeed, most of these studies have an open‐label design and have a relatively short duration of treatment in highly selected populations without major diabetes complications; therefore, long‐term endpoint studies are needed that assess safety and efficacy, and include larger numbers of patients treated with polypharmacy; these data would help to define the place of GLP‐1RAs in the T2D treatment algorithm.

The importance of the GLP‐1RA therapeutic class seems poised to increase in the treatment of T2D. Meanwhile, ongoing assessments of novel GLP‐1RAs and new delivery methods may lead to an even greater number of options in future.

### Current issues in GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy for type 2 diabetes [^114M64od]. Endocrine Practice (2013). Low credibility.

The clinical management of hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is guided not only by published treatment algorithms, but also by consideration of recent evidence and through consultation with colleagues and experts. Recent studies have dramatically increased the amount of information regarding the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs). Topics that may be of particular interest to clinicians who treat T2DM patients include relative glycemic control efficacy of GLP-1 RAs, use of GLP-1 RAs across T2DM progression and in combination with insulin, recent data regarding GLP-1 RA safety, nonglycemic actions of GLP-1 RAs, including weight effects, and impact of GLP-1 RAs on patient quality of life and treatment satisfaction.

Treatment duration subgroup analysis

The duration of treatment has emerged as a crucial factor influencing therapeutic efficacy, with clear dose-response relationships observed across various outcomes (Supplementary Figures S3A-S3K & Table S3). Long-term treatment (greater than 48 weeks) exhibited the most robust therapeutic effects on hepatic and metabolic parameters. Body weight reduction was most pronounced in long-term studies (MD = −11.49, 95% CI: −16.77 to −6.2, p < 0.0001, I² = 47%, n = 325), representing a moderate to large clinical effect. Glycaemic control showed exceptional improvement with long-term treatment (SMD = −1.06, 95% CI: −1.41 to −0.72, p < 0.00001, I² = 0%, n = 148), suggesting sustained metabolic benefits. Notably, liver fat content reduction was significantly enhanced with long-term treatment (MD = −8.03, 95% CI: −9.83 to −6.23, p < 0.00001, I² = 0%, n = 152), representing the largest effect size observed among all subgroup analyses. This was accompanied by a significant improvement in liver stiffness (MD = −0.38, 95% CI: −0.95 to 0.20, p = 0.20, I² = 95%, n = 152) and substantial reductions in liver enzymes: ALT had an (MD = −22.88, 95% CI: −38.87 to − 6.89, p = 0.005, I² = 85%, n = 325) and AST had an (MD = −15.20, 95% CI: −29.29 to −1.10, p = 0.03, I² = 92%, n = 325).

### Comparative efficacy and tolerability of currently approved incretin mimetics: a systematic analysis of placebo-controlled clinical trials [^116xhTLA]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aims

This study compares the therapeutic efficacy, gastrointestinal (GI) adverse event (AE) rates and the relationship between the therapeutic efficacy and GI AEs in randomized, placebo‐controlled clinical trials (RCTs) of GLP‐1 RAs and the dual GLP‐1/GIP agonist tirzepatide.

Materials and Methods

A systematic PubMed search identified 38 phase 3 or 4 placebo‐controlled RCTs of exenatide (b.i.d. and q.w.), lixisenatide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, albiglutide, semaglutide (s.c. and oral) and tirzepatide with a total of 16 660 individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) across 104 study arms. Changes in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose and body weight and the proportion of GI AEs (nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea) were calculated by agent, preparation and dose. The correlation between odds ratios (ORs) for GI AEs and the magnitude of therapeutic efficacy was assessed in a linear regression analysis.

Results

Baseline characteristics were similar across studies: mean age 57 ± 10 years, diabetes duration 8 ± 6 years, body mass index (BMI) 31.9 ± 5.8 kg/m 2 and HbA1c 8.2% ± 0.9%. HbA1c reductions ranged from −0.63% ± 0.03% (lixisenatide, 20 μg q.d.) to −1.79% ± 0.09% (tirzepatide, 15 mg q.w.; p < 0.0001). Weight reductions ranged from −0.75 ± 0.10 kg to −9.65 ± 0.56 kg. Despite the high variability in therapeutic efficacy, ORs for GI AEs were similar across compounds/preparations.

Conclusions

The magnitude of efficacy for intended therapeutic actions (HbA1c and body weight reduction) varied widely between incretin mimetic glucose‐lowering agents. However, larger therapeutic efficacy was not systematically associated with higher GI AE or drug discontinuation rates, indicating better tolerability of the more effective agents/preparations.

### Comparison of efficacy between incretin-based therapies for type 2 diabetes mellitus [^111JxVmC]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Comparisons between incretin mimetics (GLP-1 agonists) and incretin enhancers (DPP-4 inhibitors)

Agents in both these classes have been studied as monotherapy or in combination with other anti-diabetic medications. DPP-4 inhibitors are administered orally, once a day as compared to GLP-1 agonists which are administered subcutaneously, once or twice a day or more recently once a week. GLP-1 agonists slow gastric emptying in addition to a reduction in appetite but DPP-4 inhibitors do not seem to have these effects. In general, the observation is that GLP-1 agonists have been found to be more effective in glycemic management and weight reduction compared to DPP-4 inhibitors. However, there are a limited number of head to head studies directly comparing the effects of DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists. The first data suggesting key differences between DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists comes from an initial short term proof of concept study suggesting important mechanistic differences between exenatide twice a day (bid) and sitagliptin. Since then, longer term randomized control trials (RCTs) have compared these two classes of therapeutic agents as summarized in Table 1.

Overview of head to head comparisons amongst GLP-1 analogues and DPP-4 inhibitors.

DDP-4, dipeptidyl peptidase 4; GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide 1

The 'proof of concept' study

In a short double blind, double dummy, cross-over study involving 61 patients with metformin treated T2DM, a two-week therapy with exenatide (5 mcg bid for the first week, increasing to 10 mcg bid for the second week) was associated with greater improvement in two-hour postprandial glucose (PPG) as compared to that obtained with two weeks of therapy with sitagliptin 100 mg once daily. More importantly, sitagliptin-treated patients noticed further improvement in PPG levels after changing over to exenatide suggesting the superiority of exenatide in improving postprandial hyperglycemia, an effect of increased postprandial insulin release associated with GLP-1 receptor agonists. There was no statistically significant difference in the improvement achieved by both agents in fasting plasma glucose (FPG). The differential mechanistic effects are summarized in Table 2.

### Standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111FGoLM]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for diabetes mellitus type 2, more specifically with respect to initial therapy, treatment intensification, ADA 2025 guidelines recommend to do not use DPP4 inhibitors concurrently with GLP-1 receptor agonists or dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists due to lack of additional glucose-lowering beyond that of a GLP-1 receptor agonist alone.

Risk of bias assessment in included studies

We will assess the risk of bias in each trial using a modified version of Cochrane's RoB 1 tool for assessing risk of bias as outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We will assess the following domains: sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data and within‐study selective outcome reporting. Two review authors (GG and AG) will independently assess the risk of bias for each study based on these domains with ratings of 'low', 'high' and 'unclear' risk of bias. We will resolve discrepancies by discussion and consensus, and, if needed, by consulting a third review author (JMW). All our outcomes might be potentially influenced by knowledge of intervention received, and, therefore, do not need to be assessed differently for any of the domains.

We will report trial sponsorship, role of sponsor and intervention related to the sponsor (experimental or control) separately from the risk of bias assessment. We will conduct sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of findings when restricting the synthesis to trials at overall low risk of bias and non‐industry sponsored trials. Indeed, the potential industry bias remains important to consider because of its impact on the results. The overall risk of bias will be defined as the least favorable assessment across the domains of bias.

Measures of treatment effect

We will use mean differences (MDs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to compare the effects of different treatments on the continuous outcomes. We will extract and use change from baseline values, or end‐of‐treatment values if the former are not available. We will ensure that all scales are measuring their effect in the same direction, and we will convert any that run counter to others. We do not expect that it will be necessary to use standardized mean differences (SMDs) and their 95% CIs. Randomization allows integrating differences in mean changes and differences in end‐of‐treatment values as previously done. If data are not reported in a randomized controlled trial in a format that we can enter directly into a meta‐analysis, we will convert them to the required format using the method described in Chapter 6 of the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We will assess withdrawals due to adverse events and serious adverse events using relative estimates of the treatment effect; absolute estimates of the treatment effect will be provided by applying the relative risk to the risk in the control group.

### Efficacy and safety of GLP-1 and dual GIP / GLP-1 receptor agonists in idiopathic intracranial hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111cEdZr]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Repurposing glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists (RAs) for idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) represents an attractive alternative to current treatments, supported by evidence of potent metabolic effects and reductions in cerebrospinal fluid secretion and intracranial pressure in vivo.

Methods

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of GLP-1 RAs and GIP/GLP-1 RAs in IIH. MEDLINE and Scopus databases were searched for randomized-controlled trials (RCT), non-randomized clinical trials, or registries in adults with IIH.

Results

Two clinical trials (one RCT and one non-randomized case-control) and two registries, comprising 1550 IIH patients (768 receiving GLP-1 or GIP/GLP-1 RAs) were included. Compared with standard-of-care, GLP-1 or GIP/GLP-1 RAs were associated with a significantly lower risk of papilledema (RR: 0.25; 95% CI: 0.15–0.43; p < 0.01) and visual disturbances or blindness (RR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.18–0.92; p = 0.03), and a near-significant trend toward reduced headache risk (RR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.34–1.07; p = 0.08). Additionally, GLP-1 RAs significantly reduced monthly headache days at 3months (MD = -3.64; 95% CI: -6.26 to -1.03; p < 0.01) and at the end of follow-up (MD = -4.82; 95% CI: -8.80 to -0.85; p = 0.02). No association was detected between GLP-1 RAs and body mass index. No serious adverse events or treatment discontinuations were reported; mild gastrointestinal adverse events and nausea occurred in 88% (95% CI: 0.46–1.00) of GLP-1 RA-treated patients.

Conclusions

GLP-1 and dual GIP/GLP-1 RAs are associated with a significantly lower risk of papilledema and visual disturbances or blindness and a lower headache risk compared with standard-of-care. Additionally, GLP-1 RAs significantly reduce the monthly headache burden. Well-designed RCTs are needed to robustly evaluate the effects of GLP-1 and GIP/GLP-1 RAs in IIH, which likely extend beyond their weight-loss-inducing properties.

### Comparison review of short-acting and long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [^113xrYnX]. Diabetes Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are useful tools for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus. In their recent position statement, the American Diabetes Association and European Association for the Study of Diabetes recommend GLP1-RAs as add-on to metformin when therapeutic goals are not achieved with monotherapy, particularly for patients who wish to avoid weight gain or hypoglycemia. GLP1-RAs differ substantially in their duration of action, frequency of administration and clinical profile. Members of this class approved for clinical use include exenatide twice-daily, exenatide once-weekly, liraglutide and lixisenatide once-daily. Recently, two new once-weekly GLP1-RAs have been approved: dulaglutide and albiglutide. This article summarizes properties of short- and long-acting GLP-1 analogs, and provides useful information to help choose the most appropriate compound for individual patients.

### Efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists and dual GLP-1 / GIP receptor agonists in managing MALFD: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112CVYoK]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 7
Forest plot comparison of mono GLP-1 receptor agonists versus dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists for primary hepatic outcomes. (A) Liver fat content, (B) Liver stiffness

For ALT reduction, dual agonists achieved a large effect size (MD = −31.33, 95% CI: −38.23 to −24.44, p < 0.00001, I² = 0%, n = 258, 3 studies) compared to mono GLP-1 receptor agonists (MD = −3.38, 95% CI: −5.47 to −1.28, p = 0.002, I² = 87%, n = 1,234, 18 studies). Similarly, AST reduction was more pronounced with dual agonists (MD = −24.92, 95% CI: −33.61 to −16.24, p < 0.00001, I² = 48%, n = 257, 3 studies) versus mono agonists (MD = −1.38, 95% CI: −2.49 to − 0.27, p = 0.01, I² = 82%, n = 1234, 18 studies) (Fig. 8).

Fig. 8
Forest plot comparison of mono GLP-1 receptor agonists versus dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists for primary hepatic outcomes. (A) ALT, (B) AST

Interestingly, mono GLP-1 receptor agonists demonstrated superior glycaemic control, particularly for HbA1c reduction (MD = −0.47, 95% CI: −0.67 to −0.27, p < 0.00001, I² = 94%, n = 1,189, 18 studies), while dual agonists did not show significant HbA1c improvements in the direct subgroup comparison (Fig. 9). Also, the dual agonists showed a modest but significant reduction in triglycerides (SMD = −0.359, 95% CI: −0.700 to −0.018, p = 0.039, I² = 0%, n = 133, 1 study), indicating complementary lipid-modifying effects beyond hepatic fat reduction.

Synthesis methods

We will use the inverse‐variance weighting method to provide a pooled estimate of the effect (point estimate with 95% CI) for each outcome. As we expect a low number of dual GIP/GLP‐1 receptor agonists (probably only one at this stage), and in order to not overemphasize small trials, we will use a fixed‐effect model to pool the estimates. We will use Review Manager for analysis. All P values will be considered as 'significant' at the 5% threshold without multiple testing correction. If meta‐analysis is not possible, we will report the available point estimates of the treatment effect and, if possible, their range and distribution. The synthesis will be limited to univariate analysis without covariate adjustment. We do not expect enough data for more complex analysis. However, we will explore the potential impact of some covariates in subgroup analysis (see Investigation of heterogeneity and subgroup analysis).

### GLP-1 based therapies: clinical implications for gastroenterologists [^117956Ns]. Gut (2016). Low credibility.

The gut-derived incretin hormone, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) lowers postprandial blood glucose levels by stimulating insulin and inhibiting glucagon secretion. Two novel antihyperglycaemic drug classes augment these effects; GLP-1 receptor agonists and inhibitors of the GLP-1 degrading enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 4. These so called GLP-1 based or incretin based drugs are increasingly used to treat type 2 diabetes, because of a low risk of hypoglycaemia and favourable effect on body weight, blood pressure and lipid profiles. Besides glucose control, GLP-1 functions as an enterogastrone, causing a wide range of GI responses. Studies have shown that endogenous GLP-1 and its derived therapies slow down digestion by affecting the stomach, intestines, exocrine pancreas, gallbladder and liver. Understanding the GI actions of GLP-1 based therapies is clinically relevant; because GI side effects are common and need to be recognised, and because these drugs may be used to treat GI disease.

### Why does GLP-1 agonist combined with GIP and / or GCG agonist have greater weight loss effect than GLP-1 agonist alone in obese adults without type 2 diabetes? [^112AAPVj]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Obesity is a chronic condition demanding effective treatment strategies, among which pharmacotherapy plays a critical role. As glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonist approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for long-term weight management in adults with obesity, liraglutide and semaglutide have great weight loss effect through reducing food intake and delaying gastric emptying. The emergence of unimolecular polypharmacology, which utilizes single molecules to simultaneously target multiple receptors or pathways, marked a revolutionary improvement in GLP-1-based obesity pharmacotherapy. The dual agonist tirzepatide activates both GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors and has shown enhanced potency for weight loss compared to conventional GLP-1 mono agonist. Furthermore, emerging data suggests that unimolecular GLP-1/glucagon (GCG) dual agonist, as well as GLP-1/GIP/GCG triple agonist, may offer superior weight loss efficacy over GLP-1 agonist. This review summarizes the comprehensive mechanisms underlying the pronounced advantages of GLP-1/GIP dual agonist, GLP-1/GCG dual agonist and GLP-1/GIP/GCG triple agonist over GLP-1 mono agonist in weight reduction in obese adults without type 2 diabetes. A deeper understanding of these unimolecular multitargeting GLP-1-based agonists will provide insights for their clinical application and guide the development of new drugs for obesity treatment.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^115C63cJ]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment — insulin thresholds and combinations specify that in adults with type 2 diabetes, initiation of insulin should be considered if symptoms of hyperglycemia are present or when A1C or blood glucose levels are very high (i.e. A1C > 10% [≥ 86 mmol/mol] or blood glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL [≥ 16.7 mmol/L]); in adults with type 2 diabetes and no evidence of insulin deficiency, a GLP-1 RA, including a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, is preferred to insulin; if insulin is used, combination therapy with a GLP-1 RA, including a dual GIP and GLP-1 RA, is recommended for greater glycemic effectiveness as well as beneficial effects on weight and hypoglycemia risk for adults with type 2 diabetes, and insulin dosing should be reassessed upon addition or dose escalation of a GLP-1 RA or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA; and in adults initiating insulin therapy, continue glucose-lowering agents (unless contraindicated or not tolerated) for ongoing glycemic and metabolic benefits.

### A review of incretin therapies approved and in late-stage development for overweight and obesity management [^1145SHec]. Endocrine Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review clinical trial data for incretin therapies that are approved or in late-stage development for overweight or obesity management, along with clinical implications of these therapies and future directions.

Methods

We searched for clinical trials involving incretin therapies studied specifically for overweight or obesity management in ClinicalTrials.gov and PubMed from registry inception through December 2023.

Results

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonism, alone and in combination with glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonism or glucagon agonism, leads to significant weight reduction in people with overweight or obesity. Newer incretin therapies have demonstrated weight reduction between 15% to 25%, far outpacing non-incretin therapies for weight management and achieving levels of weight loss that may prevent weight-related complications. However, the discontinuation of incretin therapies is associated with weight regain. The main side effects of incretin therapies are transient, mild-to-moderate gastrointestinal side effects - nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and vomiting - that commonly occur in the first 4 to 8 weeks of treatment. There is a rich late-stage pipeline of incretin therapies for weight management, consisting of oral GLP-1 receptor agonists, dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists, dual GLP-1/glucagon receptor agonists, triple GLP-1/GIP/glucagon receptor agonists, and combination therapies with nonincretin drugs.

Conclusion

Newer incretin therapies for weight management have the potential to improve the treatment for overweight and obesity, the treatment and prevention of weight-related complications, and the individualization of weight management. Ensuring that these therapies are accessible - and that treatment with them is consistent and sustainable - is necessary to translate findings from trials into the real world.

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide, dual GLP-1 / GIP receptor agonists, in the management of type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113k3ESu]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 are the main incretin hormones, and be responsible for the insulinotropic incretin effect. The addition of a GIP agonist to a GLP-1agonist has been hypothesized to significantly potentiate the weight-losing and glycemia control effect, which might offer a new therapeutic option in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The current meta-analysis aims to synthesize evidence of primary efficacy and safety outcomes through clinically randomized controlled trials to evaluate integrated potency and signaling properties.

Method

We conducted comprehensive literature searches in Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Embase and PubMed for relevant literatures investigating the efficacy and/or safety of Tirzepatide published in the English as of May 30, 2023 was retrieved. We synthesized results using standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (95 CIs) for continuous outcomes, and odds ratios (ORs) along with 95 Cis for dichotomous outcomes. All analyses were done using Revman version 5.3, STATA version 15.1 and the statistical package 'meta'.

Results

Participants treated with weekly Tirzepatide achieved HbA1c and body weight target values significantly lower than any other comparator without clinically significant increase in the incidence of hypoglycemic events, serious and all-cause fatal adverse events. However, gastrointestinal adverse events and decreased appetite events were reported more frequently with Tirzepatide treatment than with placebo/controls.

Conclusion

The Tirzepatide, a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist, for diabetes therapy has opened a new era on personalized glycemia control and weight loss in a safe manner with broad and promising clinical implications.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111Q9UN7]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Type 2 diabetes — sequencing for greater glucose‑lowering potency: when even greater potency of glucose lowering is desired to reduce blood glucose to target and A1C goals, a basal insulin, either human NPH or a long‑acting insulin analog, should be initiated; however, if not already receiving GLP‑1 RA or dual GIP and GLP‑1 RA, an agent from these classes should be started first, and high‑potency GLP‑1 RAs and dual GIP and GLP‑1 RA are the preferred options for individuals requiring more intensive glucose management.

### Comparison review of short-acting and long-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [^111uCCQn]. Diabetes Therapy (2015). Low credibility.

Methods

The present paper is based on a review of recent publications on GLP-1 RA therapy and data from controlled clinical trials undertaken to investigate properties, functions, efficacy and safety of GLP RAs. Searches of PubMed were conducted for articles published between December 2013 and July 2014 using the terms "GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy", "GLP-1 and extraglycemic effects", "lixisenatide", "exenatide", "liraglutide", "dulaglutide", "albiglutide", and "long-acting GLP-1 RA".

For the introduction, we considered articles published between 1996 and 2013 on the biology and physiology of the incretin hormones and their role in the pathophysiology of T2DM. We focused on recent reviews on GLP-1 RA, meta-analyses and controlled clinical trials (January 2005 to October 2014). In particular, we analyzed controlled clinical trials comparing short- and long-acting GLP-1 RA, GLP-1 RA versus insulin, and GLP-1 versus oral agents. We also examined two meta-analyses: one around the efficacy and safety of incretin therapy, and the other comparing exenatide once-weekly or liraglutide once-daily with insulin glargine, exenatide twice-daily or placebo.

Our goal was to analyze the therapies for diabetes in use today and emphasize the mechanism and clinical efficacy of GLP-1 RA therapy. We analyze the molecules which are actually approved by Food Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA).

This article is based on previously conducted studies and does not involve any new studies of human or animal subjects performed by any of the authors.

### Efficacy and safety of LY3298176, a novel dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, in patients with type 2 diabetes: a randomised, placebo-controlled and active comparator-controlled phase 2 trial [^1114hXc5]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

LY3298176 is a novel dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that is being developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. We aimed to examine the efficacy and safety of co-stimulation of the GLP-1 and GIP receptors with LY3298176 compared with placebo or selective stimulation of GLP-1 receptors with dulaglutide in patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.

Methods

In this double-blind, randomised, phase 2 study, patients with type 2 diabetes were randomly assigned (1:1:1:1:1:1) to receive either once-weekly subcutaneous LY3298176 (1 mg, 5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg), dulaglutide (1·5 mg), or placebo for 26 weeks. Assignment was stratified by baseline glycated haemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c), metformin use, and body-mass index (BMI). Eligible participants (aged 18–75) had type 2 diabetes for at least 6 months (HbA 1c 7·0–10·5%, inclusive), that was inadequately controlled with diet and exercise alone or with stable metformin therapy, and a BMI of 23–50 kg/m 2. The primary efficacy outcome was change in HbA 1c from baseline to 26 weeks in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) population (all patients who received at least one dose of study drug and had at least one postbaseline measurement of any outcome). Secondary endpoints, measured in the mITT on treatment dataset, were change in HbA 1c from baseline to 12 weeks; change in mean bodyweight, fasting plasma glucose, waist circumference, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides, and proportion of patients reaching the HbA 1c target (≤ 6·5% and < 7·0%) from baseline to weeks 12 and 26; and proportion of patients with at least 5% and 10% bodyweight loss from baseline to 26 weeks. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT03131687.

Findings

Between May 24, 2017, and March 28, 2018, 555 participants were assessed for eligibility, of whom 318 were randomly assigned to one of the six treatment groups. Because two participants did not receive treatment, the modified intention-to-treat and safety populations included 316 participants. 258 (81·7%) participants completed 26 weeks of treatment, and 283 (89·6%) completed the study. At baseline, mean age was 57 years (SD 9), BMI was 32·6 kg/m 2 (5·9), duration from diagnosis of diabetes was 9 years (6), HbA 1c was 8·1% (1·0), 53% of patients were men, and 47% were women. At 26 weeks, the effect of LY3298176 on change in HbA 1c was dose-dependent and did not plateau. Mean changes from baseline in HbA 1c with LY3298176 were -1·06% for 1 mg, -1·73% for 5 mg, -1·89% for 10 mg, and -1·94% for 15 mg, compared with -0·06% for placebo (posterior mean differences [80% credible set] vs placebo: -1·00% [-1·22 to -0·79] for 1 mg, -1·67% [-1·88 to -1·46] for 5 mg, -1·83% [-2·04 to -1·61] for 10 mg, and -1·89% [-2·11 to -1·67] for 15 mg). Compared with dulaglutide (-1·21%) the posterior mean differences (80% credible set) for change in HbA 1c from baseline to 26 weeks with the LY3298176 doses were 0·15% (-0·08 to 0·38) for 1 mg, -0·52% (-0·72 to -0·31) for 5 mg, -0·67% (-0·89 to -0·46) for 10 mg, and -0·73% (-0·95 to -0·52) for 15 mg. At 26 weeks, 33–90% of patients treated with LY3298176 achieved the HbA 1c target of less than 7·0% (vs 52% with dulaglutide, 12% with placebo) and 15–82% achieved the HbA 1c target of at least 6·5% (vs 39% with dulaglutide, 2% with placebo). Changes in fasting plasma glucose ranged from -0·4 mmol/L to -3·4 mmol/L for LY3298176 (vs 0·9 mmol/L for placebo, -1·2 mmol/L for dulaglutide). Changes in mean bodyweight ranged from -0·9 kg to -11·3 kg for LY3298176 (vs -0·4 kg for placebo, -2·7 kg for dulaglutide). At 26 weeks, 14–71% of those treated with LY3298176 achieved the weight loss target of at least 5% (vs 22% with dulaglutide, 0% with placebo) and 6–39% achieved the weight loss target of at least 10% (vs 9% with dulaglutide, 0% with placebo). Changes in waist circumference ranged from -2·1 cm to -10·2 cm for LY3298176 (vs -1·3 cm for placebo, -2·5 cm for dulaglutide). Changes in total cholesterol ranged from 0·2 mmol/L to -0·3 mmol/L for LY3298176 (vs 0·3 mmol/L for placebo, -0·2 mmol/L for dulaglutide). Changes in HDL or LDL cholesterol did not differ between the LY3298176 and placebo groups. Changes in triglyceride concentration ranged from 0 mmol/L to -0·8 mmol/L for LY3298176 (vs 0·3 mmol/L for placebo, -0·3 mmol/L for dulaglutide). The 12-week outcomes were similar to those at 26 weeks for all secondary outcomes. 13 (4%) of 316 participants across the six treatment groups had 23 serious adverse events in total. Gastrointestinal events (nausea, diarrhoea, and vomiting) were the most common treatment-emergent adverse events. The incidence of gastrointestinal events was dose-related (23·1% for 1 mg LY3298176, 32·7% for 5 mg LY3298176, 51·0% for 10 mg LY3298176, and 66·0% for 15 mg LY3298176, 42·6% for dulaglutide, 9·8% for placebo); most events were mild to moderate in intensity and transient. Decreased appetite was the second most common adverse event (3·8% for 1 mg LY3298176, 20·0% for 5 mg LY3298176, 25·5% for 10 mg LY3298176, 18·9% for 15 mg LY3298176, 5·6% for dulaglutide, 2·0% for placebo). There were no reports of severe hypoglycaemia. One patient in the placebo group died from lung adenocarcinoma stage IV, which was unrelated to study treatment.

Interpretation

The dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, LY3298176, showed significantly better efficacy with regard to glucose control and weight loss than did dulaglutide, with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. Combined GIP and GLP-1 receptor stimulation might offer a new therapeutic option in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists: a review of head-to-head clinical studies [^115K6iWE]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) are attractive options for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) because they effectively lower A1C and weight while having a low risk of hypoglycemia. The GLP-1 RA class has grown in the last decade with several agents available for use in the US and Europe and several more in development. Since the efficacy and tolerability, dosing frequency, administration requirements, and cost may vary between agents within the class, each agent may offer unique advantages and disadvantages. Through a review of phase III clinical programs for exenatide twice daily, exenatide once weekly, liraglutide, albiglutide, lixisenatide, and dulaglutide, eight head-to-head trials have evaluated the safety and efficacy of GLP-1 RA active comparators. The purpose of this review is to provide an analysis of these trials. The GLP-1 RA head-to-head clinical studies have demonstrated that all GLP-1 RA agents are effective therapeutic options at reducing A1C. However, differences exist in terms of magnitude of effect on A1C and weight as well as frequency and severity of adverse effects.

### Incretin therapies: highlighting common features and differences in the modes of action of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors [^114bHvUS]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Over the last few years, incretin-based therapies have emerged as important agents in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D). These agents exert their effect via the incretin system, specifically targeting the receptor for the incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which is partly responsible for augmenting glucose-dependent insulin secretion in response to nutrient intake (the 'incretin effect'). In patients with T2D, pharmacological doses/concentrations of GLP-1 can compensate for the inability of diabetic β cells to respond to the main incretin hormone glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, and this is therefore a suitable parent compound for incretin-based glucose-lowering medications. Two classes of incretin-based therapies are available: GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. GLP-1RAs promote GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) signalling by providing GLP-1R stimulation through 'incretin mimetics' circulating at pharmacological concentrations, whereas DPP-4 inhibitors prevent the degradation of endogenously released GLP-1. Both agents produce reductions in plasma glucose and, as a result of their glucose-dependent mode of action, this is associated with low rates of hypoglycaemia; however, there are distinct modes of action resulting in differing efficacy and tolerability profiles. Furthermore, as their actions are not restricted to stimulating insulin secretion, these agents have also been associated with additional non-glycaemic benefits such as weight loss, improvements in β-cell function and cardiovascular risk markers. These attributes have made incretin therapies attractive treatments for the management of T2D and have presented physicians with an opportunity to tailor treatment plans. This review endeavours to outline the commonalities and differences among incretin-based therapies and to provide guidance regarding agents most suitable for treating T2D in individual patients.

### The safety and tolerability of GLP-1 receptor agonists in the treatment of type 2 diabetes: a review [^114e6eoT]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Although several classes of pharmacotherapy are available for type 2 diabetes, glycaemic control is often hampered by medication-related adverse effects and contraindications such as renal impairment. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists provide a new pharmacotherapeutic option based on the multiple glucose-lowering effects of the human hormone GLP-1. This mechanism of action not only provides therapeutic efficacy but also suggests that GLP-1 receptor agonists have distinct safety and tolerability concerns compared with other diabetes therapies. Stimulation of pancreatic insulin secretion by GLP-1 receptor agonists is glucose dependent, conferring a lesser risk of hypoglycaemia than that seen with sulfonylureas. Individual GLP-1 receptor agonists differ in their metabolism and excretion profiles, affecting the choice of agent for patients with renal impairment. As with other protein-based therapies, GLP-1 receptor agonists may induce the formation of antibodies that may attenuate therapeutic efficacy and affect safety. Conclusions on cardiovascular safety must await outcomes studies, but at present no signal of harm has been reported, and preclinical data and effects on risk markers suggest a potential for benefit. Current data on thyroid medullary cancer in humans and pancreatic malignancy in rodents do not suggest that there is any reason to restrict the clinical use of GLP-1 analogues in most people with diabetes. It is currently difficult to ascertain the possible contributory role of GLP-1 receptor agonists in increasing the risk of pancreatitis, and vigilance for signs and symptoms is prudent. Primary tolerability issues include transient gastrointestinal symptoms, common with GLP-1 receptor agonists, which can be reduced through dose titration.

### Alternative dosing regimens of GLP-1 receptor agonists may reduce costs and maintain weight loss efficacy [^114vYeLM]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Obesity is the most prevalent chronic disease worldwideand drives significant morbidity and mortality. Obesity increases the risk of a variety of other chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. In the United States (US), approximately 71% of adults are overweight (defined as having a body mass index (BMI) in kg/m 2 greater than or equal to 25), including 41% who are obese (BMI ≥ 30) and 8% who are severely obese (BMI ≥ 40). The financial costs of excess adiposity are massive, as it is estimated that obesity results in over $170 billion in healthcare spending in the US every year.

We are currently in the midst of a revolution in weight loss interventions. Indeed, while both lifestyle and older pharmaceutical approaches have demonstrated limited efficacy, glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) and dual GLP1/gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GLP‐1/GIP) receptor agonists have recently been shown to yield unprecedented levels of weight loss. For example, the incretin mimetics semaglutide and tirzepatide have been shown via meta‐analyses of randomized controlled trials to induce placebo‐adjusted average body weight losses of 15.0% and 19.2%, respectively, and have shown significant weight loss in a recent head‐to‐head comparison.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). High credibility.

NuSH therapy selection and contraindications — among the NuSH therapies, semaglutide and tirzepatide have the highest efficacy and are the obesity medications of choice; clinical trial and real-world observational data support slightly greater weight loss with tirzepatide; insurance coverage, availability, and affordability are likely to dictate agent selection; both GLP-1 and GIP receptor agonists are contraindicated in patients who have a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma, multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2, or known hypersensitivity to an individual product or any excipients.

### Tirzepatide, a dual GIP / GLP-1 receptor co-agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes with unmatched effectiveness regrading glycaemic control and body weight reduction [^115oh8ff]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide is the first dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor co-agonist approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in the United States, Europe, and the UAE. Tirzepatide is an acylated peptide engineered to activate the GIP and GLP-1 receptors, key mediators of insulin secretion that are also expressed in regions of the brain that regulate food intake. Five clinical trials in type 2-diabetic subjects (SURPASS 1–5) have shown that tirzepatide at 5–15 mg per week reduces both HbA 1c (1.24 to 2.58%) and body weight (5.4–11.7 kg) by amounts unprecedented for a single agent. A sizable proportion of patients (23.0 to 62.4%) reached an HbA 1c of < 5.7% (which is the upper limit of the normal range indicating normoglycaemia), and 20.7 to 68.4% lost more than 10% of their baseline body weight. Tirzepatide was significantly more effective in reducing HbA 1c and body weight than the selective GLP-1 RA semaglutide (1.0 mg per week), and titrated basal insulin. Adverse events related to tirzepatide were similar to what has been reported for selective GLP-1RA, mainly nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and constipation, that were more common at higher doses. Cardiovascular events have been adjudicated across the whole study program, and MACE-4 (nonfatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, cardiovascular death and hospital admission for angina) events tended to be reduced over up to a 2 year-period, albeit with low numbers of events. For none of the cardiovascular events analysed (MACE-4, or its components) was a hazard ratio > 1.0 vs. pooled comparators found in a meta-analysis covering the whole clinical trial program, and the upper bounds of the confidence intervals for MACE were < 1.3, fulfilling conventional definitions of cardiovascular safety. Tirzepatide was found to improve insulin sensitivity and insulin secretory responses to a greater extent than semaglutide, and this was associated with lower prandial insulin and glucagon concentrations. Both drugs caused similar reductions in appetite, although tirzepatide caused greater weight loss. While the clinical effects of tirzepatide have been very encouraging, important questions remain as to the mechanism of action. While GIP reduces food intake and body weight in rodents, these effects have not been demonstrated in humans. Moreover, it remains to be shown that GIPR agonism can improve insulin secretion in type 2 diabetic patients who have been noted in previous studies to be unresponsive to GIP. Certainly, the apparent advantage of tirzepatide, a dual incretin agonist, over GLP-1RA will spark renewed interest in the therapeutic potential of GIP in type 2 diabetes, obesity and related co-morbidities.

Anti-obesity medications and comparative weight loss — tirzepatide versus semaglutide are contrasted with quantified outcomes. The dual GLP-1 receptor/GIP agonist tirzepatide is associated with greater weight loss than the single GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide, and a trial in individuals with obesity reported greater average weight loss with tirzepatide (20.2% vs 13.7% at 72 weeks); this study did not specifically assess individuals with HF. Additional therapies with different mechanisms of action are being explored.

### A critical analysis of the clinical use of incretin-based therapies: are the GLP-1 therapies safe? [^111qW2Pe]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

There is no question that incretin-based glucose-lowering medications have proven to be effective glucose-lowering agents. Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists demonstrate an efficacy comparable to insulin treatment and appear to do so with significant effects to promote weight loss with minimal hypoglycemia. In addition, there are significant data with dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors showing efficacy comparable to sulfonylureas but with weight neutral effects and reduced risk for hypoglycemia. However, over the recent past there have been concerns reported regarding the long-term consequences of using such therapies, and the issues raised are in regard to the potential of both classes to promote acute pancreatitis, to initiate histological changes suggesting chronic pancreatitis including associated preneoplastic lesions, and potentially, in the long run, pancreatic cancer. Other issues relate to a potential risk for the increase in thyroid cancer. There are clearly conflicting data that have been presented in preclinical studies and in epidemiologic studies. To provide an understanding of both sides of the argument, we provide a discussion of this topic as part of this two-part point-counterpoint narrative. In the point narrative below, Dr. Butler and colleagues provide their opinion and review of the data to date and that we need to reconsider the use of incretin-based therapies because of the growing concern of potential risk and based on a clearer understanding of the mechanism of action. In the counterpoint narrative following the contribution by Dr. Butler and colleagues, Dr. Nauck provides a defense of incretin-based therapies and that the benefits clearly outweigh any concern of risk.

### Relative efficacy of GLP-1 and GLP-1 / GIP receptor agonists in the prevention of alcohol-use disorders using a target trial emulation approach [^116ChP3c]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

There is growing evidence that the GLP-1 system is implicated in alcohol and other substance use disorders, and that GLP-1-based therapies may have therapeutic relevance in alcohol use disorder (AUD). We aimed to determine the impact of GLP-1 based therapies on incident AUDs in a real-world setting in patients with T2D.

Material and Methods

We conducted emulation target trials based on a real-world network of electronic health records (EHRs) from over 120 million patients in the United States of America. Four target trials were emulated among eligible patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who had no prior AUD diagnosis by comparing tirzepatide, semaglutide, liraglutide, and dulaglutide with DPP4 inhibitors (DPP4i). First-ever diagnosis of AUD occurred within an 18-month follow-up period and was examined using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. Four target trial cohorts were generated and compared with a reference arm of patients treated with DPP4i: cohort (1) treatment with tirzepatide; cohort (2) treatment with semaglutide; cohort (3) treatment with liraglutide; and cohort (4) treatment with dulaglutide. Cohorts underwent propensity score matching 1:1 for confounders. We examined rates of incident AUD (ICD-10 code F10) and performed head-to-head analyses of the incretin-based therapies. We also performed sensitivity analyses relating to whether treatment was adjunctive therapy with metformin and by treatment adherence.

Results

After propensity-score matching, we identified four target trials of patients treated with tirzepatide (n = 7165), semaglutide (n = 20198), liraglutide (n = 6565), and dulaglutide (n = 19061); 1:1 with the reference (DPP4i) patients. Tirzepatide and semaglutide (but not liraglutide or dulaglutide) were associated with significant risk reduction of incident AUD compared to DPP4i (hazard ratio 0.47 [95% confidence interval 0.29, 0.75] and 0.68 [0.52, 0.89], respectively). Head-to-head comparison revealed tirzepatide had a significant risk reduction compared to liraglutide in incident AUD (0.47 [0.24, 0.92]).

Conclusion

In patients with T2D, tirzepatide and semaglutide treatment is associated with a lower incidence of AUD; robust randomised, controlled evidence for the use of these drugs for this novel indication is appropriate.

### Review of head-to-head comparisons of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [^1161AXq3]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2016). Low credibility.

Currently, six glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are approved for treating type 2 diabetes. These fall into two classes based on their receptor activation: short-acting exenatide twice daily and lixisenatide once daily; and longer-acting liraglutide once daily, exenatide once weekly, albiglutide once weekly and dulaglutide once weekly. The phase III trial of a seventh GLP-1RA, taspoglutide once weekly, was stopped because of unacceptable adverse events (AEs). Nine phase III head-to-head trials and one large phase II study have compared the efficacy and safety of these seven GLP-1RAs. All trials were associated with notable reductions in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, although liraglutide led to greater decreases than exenatide formulations and albiglutide, and HbA1c reductions did not differ between liraglutide and dulaglutide. As the short-acting GLP-1RAs delay gastric emptying, they have greater effects on postprandial glucose levels than the longer-acting agents, whereas the longer-acting compounds reduced plasma glucose throughout the 24-h period studied. Liraglutide was associated with weight reductions similar to those with exenatide twice daily but greater than those with exenatide once weekly, albiglutide and dulaglutide. The most frequently observed AEs with GLP-1RAs were gastrointestinal disorders, particularly nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea. Nauseaoccurred less frequently, however, with exenatide once weekly and albiglutide than exenatide twice daily and liraglutide. Both exenatide formulations and albiglutide may be associated with higher incidences of injection-site reactions than liraglutide and dulaglutide. GLP-1RA use in clinical practice should be customized for individual patients, based on clinical profile and patient preference. Ongoing assessments of novel GLP-1RAs and delivery methods may further expand future treatment options.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide / glucagon-like peptide-1 (GIP / GLP-1) receptor agonists compared to glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists [^111MYx4v]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

The review will be conducted following the Methodological Expectations for Cochrane Intervention Reviews and reported following PRISMA guidelines.

Criteria for considering studies for this review

Types of studies

We will include only randomized controlled trials (i.e. with a random allocation of the interventions). This will ensure that we have more confidence in the findings compared to non‐randomized studies, and our outcomes of interest are expected to be well captured in randomized trials. Hence, we will exclude non‐randomized studies (including 'quasi‐randomized' as defined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions).

We will exclude cluster‐randomized studies because they do not allow assessment of the intervention effect at the individual level. We will include cross‐over studies, but will use only data from the first period to avoid a carry‐over effect. There will be no restrictions on the year of publication, report status or language.

Types of participants

We will include participants of any age, sex and ethnicity, with and without hypertension. Following a previous approach, all participants treated with the interventions of interest will be included without restriction by type of disease.

We will include healthy participants. We will use the definition of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) to characterize 'healthy' participants as people with "no known significant health problems who participate in research to test a new drug". Including healthy participants will allow us to assess the specific impact of the intervention on blood pressure without the potential impact of the underlying indication of the intervention.

We will include studies with subsets of eligible participants only if data for that subset are reported separately. If not, we will contact the study authors to request those data.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea [^111ek55E]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review highlights the emerging data on the use of incretin therapies, including glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) and dual GLP-1RA and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) receptor agonists, on the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Given known cardiometabolic and neurocognitive consequences of OSA, optimizing treatment is essential. In the setting of widespread research efforts and clinical implementation of dual agonists in managing OSA, obesity and other cardiometabolic diseases, this review is timely.

Recent Findings

Several randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have shown GLP-1 and GIP receptor agonists to reduce apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and body weight in patients with OSA. This impact has been demonstrated with the use of pharmacotherapy alone and in combination with traditional positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy. GLP-1RA may positively affect OSA through reducing systemic inflammation and decreasing adiposity, including via hormone changes, delayed gastric emptying, and central mechanisms impacting appetite regulation and sleep-wakefulness.

Summary

Novel pharmacological advances in individuals with OSA and obesity have shown promise in cardiometabolic disease control. Longitudinal follow-up to monitor the efficacy and adverse effects of incretin therapies, and further comparison studies with PAP therapy, are warranted.

### What is the pipeline for future medications for obesity? [^111cpo2m]. International Journal of Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Obesity is a chronic disease associated with increased risk of obesity-related complications and mortality. Our better understanding of the weight regulation mechanisms and the role of gut-brain axis on appetite has led to the development of safe and effective entero-pancreatic hormone-based treatments for obesity such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RA). Semaglutide 2.4mg once weekly, a subcutaneously administered GLP-1 RA approved for obesity treatment in 2021, results in 15–17% mean weight loss (WL) with evidence of cardioprotection. Oral GLP-1 RA are also under development and early data shows similar WL efficacy to semaglutide 2.4mg. Looking to the next generation of obesity treatments, combinations of GLP-1 with other entero-pancreatic hormones with complementary actions and/or synergistic potential (such as glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), glucagon, and amylin) are under investigation to enhance the WL and cardiometabolic benefits of GLP-1 RA. Tirzepatide, a dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonist has been approved for glycaemic control in type 2 diabetes as well as for obesity management leading in up to 22.5% WL in phase 3 obesity trials. Other combinations of entero-pancreatic hormones including cagrisema (GLP-1/amylin RA) and the triple agonist retatrutide (GLP-1/GIP/glucagon RA) have also progressed to phase 3 trials as obesity treatments and early data suggests that may lead to even greater WL than tirzepatide. Additionally, agents with different mechanisms of action to entero-pancreatic hormones (e.g. bimagrumab) may improve the body composition during WL and are in early phase clinical trials. We are in a new era for obesity pharmacotherapy where combinations of entero-pancreatic hormones approach the WL achieved with bariatric surgery. In this review, we present the efficacy and safety data for the pipeline of obesity pharmacotherapies with a focus on entero-pancreatic hormone-based treatments and we consider the clinical implications and challenges that the new era in obesity management may bring.

### Efficacy and safety of GLP-1 receptor agonists, dual agonists, and retatrutide for weight loss in adults with overweight or obesity: a Bayesian NMA [^1121K46a]. Obesity (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To compare the efficacy and safety of GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), dual agonists (GLP-1RAs/GIP or GCGR), and retatrutide (GLP-1/GIP/glucagon) for weight loss in adults with overweight or obesity.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and Bayesian network meta-analysis (NMA) of 19 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including 29,506 adults (BMI ≥ 25kg/m 2), assessing liraglutide, semaglutide, survodutide, tirzepatide, retatrutide, and placebo. Outcomes included mean weight loss, achievement of ≥ 5%, ≥ 10%, and ≥ 15% weight loss, waist circumference (WC), BMI, and adverse events (AEs) at ≥ 36weeks. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses evaluated the impact of diabetes status, sex, age, and BMI.

Results

Retatrutide and dual agonists achieved equivalent mean weight loss (-11.0kg), surpassing GLP-1RAs (-9.0kg), with retatrutide excelling at achieving ≥ 15% weight loss (OR 54.6). Dual agonists and GLP-1RAs followed (OR 16.4 and 9.0, respectively). Retatrutide had the highest AE risk. Meta-regression showed type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) reduced weight loss by 4.338kg for GLP-1RAs and 5.016kg for dual agonists, with enhanced outcomes in female-dominant or high-BMI cohorts.

Conclusions

Retatrutide offers superior weight loss efficacy but with a higher AE risk. Dual agonists provide a favorable efficacy-safety balance. Personalized treatment selection based on patient characteristics is recommended.

### Recent advances in incretin-based therapies [^1141ASnh]. Clinical Endocrinology (2012). Low credibility.

The global burden of type 2 diabetes is growing. Traditional therapies are suboptimal and there is a clear unmet need for treatments that offer effective glucose control while addressing the comorbid factors associated with diabetes, such as obesity and risk of cardiovascular disease, without the fear of hypoglycaemia. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors offer a novel way of reducing hyperglycaemia by targeting the incretin system. This review provides an overview of the development of incretin-based therapies and explains their differing modes of action compared with traditional interventions. A comparison of the clinical profiles of current glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [liraglutide and exenatide (twice-daily and once-weekly)] and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (sitagliptin, saxagliptin, vildagliptin and linagliptin) is performed alongside a discussion of the placement of incretin-based therapies in treatment guidelines. Further improvements in this class are expected, and we will examine some of the novel glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors currently under development.

### Real-world evidence on the utilization, clinical and comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of newer GLP-1RA-based weight-loss therapies [^115aKutV]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have emerged as key agents for weight management, based on their marked efficacy as observed in randomized controlled trials. While still limited, real-world studies on GLP-1RA use in populations with obesity are increasingly available. This narrative review discusses contemporary real-world evidence demonstrating the utilization, clinical and comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of the currently approved GLP-1RA-based weight-loss therapies, that is, liraglutide, semaglutide and tirzepatide. The observed weight reduction in clinical practice overall tends to be lower than in randomized controlled trials; however, outcomes approach those seen in trials when focusing on highly adherent patients. Real-world studies demonstrate high discontinuation rates of GLP-1RAs (20%-50%) within the first year, and the use of much lower doses than those evaluated in clinical trials. Evidence from observational studies within type 2 diabetes or obesity populations suggests frequent gastrointestinal disturbances in GLP-1RA users, as also observed in trials, but no clear increase in risks of severe events like pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer, thyroid disorders, or depression and self-harm. Further evidence is needed to understand possible real-world associations of GLP-1RAs with eye disease and other rare outcomes. We provide 10 areas of particular importance for further research on GLP-1RA within the real-world space, including improved understanding of the exact drivers of early discontinuation and suboptimal dosing, studies of the effects of stopping GLP-1RA treatment, and investigations of clinical and cost-effectiveness for hard clinical outcomes in real-world settings, including not only cardio-reno-metabolic outcomes but also obesity-induced diseases like neuropsychiatric disease, cancer, musculoskeletal disease, and infections. PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY: Recent advancements in weight-loss medications have sparked a lot of interest. The so-called GLP-1 receptor agonist medications (GLP-1RAs) have gained a lot of attention, because they have shown to be very effective, leading to significant weight loss in patients participating in clinical trials. GLP-1RAs, like liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide, help manage weight by mimicking hormones that control blood sugar and appetite. However, how these medications perform in real life can be different from the controlled settings of clinical trials, in which patients are carefully selected and their treatment plans closely followed. This literature review looks at how these medications are used and their effectiveness and safety in real-world settings. In real-life practice, GLP-1RAs are often less effective than in clinical trial conditions. This is usually because patients don't follow their medication plans as strictly as in trials. Real-world data shows that many patients use lower doses and do not stick to their treatment as strictly as participants in a controlled trial might, leading to less weight loss. However, those who do follow their plans closely can achieve results similar to those in trials. A major issue with GLP-1RAs is that many patients stop using them within the first year due to side effects or high costs of the medications, especially if not covered by insurance. Common side effects include nausea and digestive problems, which are the main reasons patients stop taking these treatments. These side effects are often manageable and decrease over time, and this reviews found no strong real-world evidence that GLP-1RAs cause severe side effects in many users. Despite these challenges, when GLP-1RAs are used effectively and consistently, they show substantial benefits in weight loss, most so the newest medications semaglutide and tirzepatide. These medications are also likely to help manage and prevent weight-related health conditions like type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, but evidence for these beneficial outcomes is still scarce in real-world settings. The review emphasizes the need for more research to understand why many patients stop using these medications and how to improve dosing. It also calls for studies on the long-term effects of these therapies on various health outcomes, including mental health, cardiometabolic health, cancer, and rare conditions like eye diseases. Overall, while GLP-1RAs are a valuable tool for weight management, their real-world use requires careful consideration of individual patient factors, such as the ability to stick to treatment plans, manage side effects, and afford the medications. Further research will help make these treatments more effective for a wider range of people that need them.

### Bridging the gap between GLP1-receptor agonists and cardiovascular outcomes: evidence for the role of tirzepatide [^114zGqGQ]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

A new drug named tirzepatide has been approved to treat T2DM, and it is expected to be approved for weight loss by activating both GLP-1 and GIP receptors through a unique mechanism. Currently, there are other dual GIPR/GLP-1R agonists available, such as GLP-1R/GR (glucagon receptor), GLP-1R/AR (amylin receptor), and GLP-1R/NPYR (peptide YY binds to neuropeptide Y receptors) and even triple agonists that can activate GIPR to treat obesity and T2DM. This has led to renewed interest in understanding the safety of GIP/GIPR in humans. It is essential to gain a deeper understanding of GIP safety to guide future research projects and develop GIP-based treatments. The post hoc analysis found that tirzepatide at all doses investigated reduced the prevalence of metabolic syndrome related to cardiovascular risk factors more than placebo, semaglutide 1 mg, insulin degludec, and insulin glargine. Comparing tirzepatide to GLP1RAs using the results of prior comparison trials is challenging. However, the added agonism of GIPR seems to have a more positive impact on weight loss. It is important to develop a single pharmacological medication with multiple functions, such as tirzepatide. This medication can increase insulin sensitivity, decrease weight, and treat dyslipidemia at an early clinical stage, while also dramatically lowering blood sugar levels. Therefore, it seems that tirzepatide is more than just a new antidiabetic drug. The development of further dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists seems to be a promising next step in managing various cardiovascular disease. However, further research is needed to determine the long-term impacts of these substances. The role of tirzepatide in therapy will become more evident as more research is conducted.

### Efficacy and safety of GLP-1 and dual GIP / GLP-1 receptor agonists in idiopathic intracranial hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111EeYrw]. European Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Repurposing glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1 RAs) and dual GIP/GLP‐1 receptor agonists (GIP/GLP‐1 RAs) for IIH represents an attractive alternative to currently available IIH treatments. Initially developed for the treatment of type‐2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), GLP‐1 and GIP/GLP‐1 RAs are presently licensed as anti‐obesity agents for obese or overweight adults with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m 2 or a BMI ≥ 27 kg/m 2 with at least one cardiovascular risk factor (such as prediabetes, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and elevated waist circumference) or obesity‐related comorbidity (including non‐alcoholic fatty liver disease and obstructive sleep apnea). As incretin‐based therapies, GLP‐1 RAs exert pleiotropic effects, with potential utility in IIH extending beyond weight loss and satiety induction to include (i) reduced cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) secretion in preclinical IIH models via binding to GLP‐1 receptors in the choroid plexus, and (ii) pain relief through antinociceptive effects in the central nervous system. In addition, dual GIP/GLP‐1 RAs, also classified as incretin‐based therapies, act through synergistic binding to peripheral and central GIP and GLP‐1 receptors, demonstrating superior glucose‐regulating properties and inducing more potent, sustained weight loss compared with single GLP‐1 RAs.

Given the compelling preclinical data and the expanding applications of GLP‐1 and GIP/GLP‐1 RAs, their use in IIH has already been incorporated into clinical practice guidelines, though evidence from dedicated randomized‐controlled clinical trials (RCTs) is limited. To this end, the aim of the present systematic review and meta‐analysis is to comprehensively evaluate the so‐far available clinical data on the safety and efficacy of GLP‐1 and GIP/GLP‐1 RAs in IIH.

Type 2 diabetes — injectable therapy selection and reassessment: If injectable therapy is needed to reduce A1C, consider GLP-1 RA or dual GIP and GLP-1 RA in most individuals prior to insulin, and to avoid therapeutic inertia, reassess and modify treatment regularly (e.g., every 3–6 months). Insulin can be used as the first injectable if symptoms of hyperglycemia are present or when A1C or blood glucose levels are very high (i.e. A1C > 10% [86 mmol/mol] or blood glucose ≥ 300 mg/dL [16.7 mmol/L]).

### Mechanisms and clinical applications of incretin therapies for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^112uj7jv]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is the leading cause of kidney failure worldwide. Development of DKD increases risks for cardiovascular events and death. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist have demonstrated improved cardiovascular and kidney outcomes in large-scale clinical trials.

Recent Finding

GLP-1 and dual GLP-1/glucose-depending insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptor agonists have robust glucose-lowering efficacy with low risk of hypoglycemia even in advanced stages of DKD. Initially approved as antihyperglycemic therapies, these agents also reduce blood pressure and body weight. Cardiovascular outcome and glycemic lowering trials have reported decreased risks of development and progression of DKD and atherosclerotic cardiovascular events for GLP-1 receptor agonists. Kidney and cardiovascular protection is mediated partly, but not entirely, by lowering of glycemia, body weight, and blood pressure. Experimental data have identified modulation of the innate immune response as a biologically plausible mechanism underpinning kidney and cardiovascular effects.

Summary

An influx of incretin-based therapies has changed the landscape of DKD treatment. GLP-1 receptor agonist use is endorsed by all major guideline forming organizations. Ongoing clinical trials and mechanistic studies with GLP-1 and dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists will further define the roles and pathways for these agents in the treatment of DKD.

Anti-obesity medications in heart failure — U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved second-generation agents including orlistat, phentermine/topiramate, and naltrexone/bupropion have minimal efficacy and limiting side effects, particularly in individuals with HF; third-generation agents comprise hormone-based therapies that target metabolic pathways and control appetite, and therapies studied in HF include the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (semaglutide) and the GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) dual receptor agonist (tirzepatide).

### Efficacy and safety of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on prediabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116UgFKQ]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2024). Medium credibility.

The safety analysis revealed that GLP-1RAs were associated with a higher incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, compared to the control group. These side effects are consistent with the known gastrointestinal effects of GLP-1RAs, which are generally considered tolerable and transient in nature. These events often occur due to the effects of GLP-1RAs on gastric emptying and satiety. Although they may lead to treatment discontinuation in some cases, appropriate patient education and management strategies can mitigate their impact and improve treatment adherence. It is essential for clinicians to be aware of these potential adverse events and to counsel patients accordingly to ensure adherence to treatment. Importantly, our analysis did not find a significant increase in serious adverse events associated with GLP-1RA use in prediabetic patients. This finding is reassuring and suggests that GLP-1RAs can be tolerable for use in this population with an overall favorable benefit-risk profile.

According to the American Diabetes Association, the current recommended treatment for prediabetes is metformin along with lifestyle modification. We revealed that GLP-1RAs combined with lifestyle modification resulted in better management than lifestyle modification alone. Our findings guide future guidelines to include GLP-1RAs as an addition to lifestyle modification instead of metformin in the management of prediabetic individuals who are intolerant to metformin. Further comparative studies are needed to identify the most effective medication along with lifestyle modification.

Strengths and limitations

A comprehensive, large-scale search was conducted in the present study to retrieve all potentially relevant studies. Furthermore, the majority of the studies included were of high quality, and no publication bias was found. The majority of the pooled effects of the outcomes were homogenous, adding to the robustness of the findings. We performed a sensitivity analysis by omitting studies with different characteristics to evaluate how robust our conclusions are, and the results showed no significant changes. However, there are some limits. Some of the included studies did not mention if patients did not take any therapies that could directly or indirectly influence circulating glucose values. However, the majority reported that they excluded patients receiving weight loss medications or medications affecting carbohydrate metabolism. Our primary outcome had a high degree of heterogeneity that could only be partially resolved. However, subgroup analysis revealed that the duration of the treatment could explain this. Furthermore, due to limited data, we were unable to draw firm conclusions about the effects of different doses and types of GLP-1RAs.

### Novel pharmacotherapies for weight loss: understanding the role of incretins to enable weight loss and improved health outcomes [^112jBAN4]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) are widespread diseases that significantly impact cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. In the recent years, intensive research has been performed to assess the role of adipose tissue and body fat distribution in the development of metabolic and non-metabolic complications in individuals with obesity. In addition to lifestyle modifications, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1-RA) have become a meaningful treatment expansion for the management of both disorders. In addition to improving metabolic control and reducing body weight, treatment with GLP-1-RAs reduces cardiovascular and renal events in individuals with obesity with and without diabetes. These important benefits of GLP-1-RAs have triggered new interest in other enteroendocrine and enteropancreatic peptides for treating obesity and its metabolic and non-metabolic consequences. The first peptide dual-agonist targeting glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 receptors has been approved for the treatment of T2D and obesity. GIP/GLP-1 dual-agonism appear to provide better metabolic control and greater weight reduction compared with GLP-1-R mono-agonism. Other peptide and non-peptide co-agonists are in clinical development for obesity, T2D, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and other metabolic disorders. This narrative review aims to summarize the available data on approved and emerging enteroendocrine and enteropancreatic based treatment approaches for obesity and metabolic disorders. In addition to available clinical efficacy measures, side effects, limitations and open challenges will also be addressed.

### The new dual gastric inhibitory peptide / glucagon-like peptide 1 agonist tirzepatide in type 2 diabetes: is the future bright? [^112X3TUk]. Diabetes/Metabolism Research and Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Tirzepatide is a dual gastric inhibitory peptide/glucagon-like peptide 1 (GIP/GLP-1) receptor agonist formulated as a synthetic linear peptide, based on the native GIP sequence. It has a prolonged half-life of 5 days, which enables once-weekly dosing. Studies have hitherto demonstrated its superiority in achieving optimal glycaemic control and body weight management, as compared with various agents used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including GLP-1 receptor agonists. Thus, it is expected to enrich our therapeutic armamentarium in T2DM. However, further experience, notably longer follow-up data and information on cardiovascular effects, is still needed.

### Pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^111o3WxT]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Glycemic thresholds for intensification and insulin initiation in type 2 diabetes: When A1C is ≥ 1.5% above the individualized glycemic goal, many individuals will require dual-combination therapy or a more potent agent; insulin should be considered as part of any combination plan when hyperglycemia is severe, and it is common practice to initiate insulin for blood glucose levels ≥ 300 mg/dL (≥ 16.7 mmol/L) or A1C ≥ 10% (≥ 86 mmol/mol), or if symptomatic hyperglycemia or catabolic signs are present; people with severe hyperglycemia can also be effectively treated with a sulfonylurea, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), or dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 RA, though evidence is scarce for baseline A1C above 10–12%.

Pharmacological interventions

For patients who do not achieve adequate weight loss with lifestyle and behavioral interventions alone, pharmacotherapy is a key adjunctive treatment. The landscape of anti-obesity medications has expanded significantly, offering new mechanisms of action and greater efficacy. Current long-term options include intestinal lipase inhibitors (orlistat), combination agents targeting central appetite pathways (phentermine-topiramate, naltrexone-bupropion), and incretin-based therapies. The development of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (such as liraglutide and semaglutide) and dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (such as tirzepatide) represents a major advancement, demonstrating average weight loss ranging from 5% to over 20% in clinical trials. These agents promote weight loss by suppressing hunger, increasing satiety, and slowing gastric emptying. Emerging therapies, including triple agonists (retatrutide) and novel combinations, promise even greater efficacy in the future. The selection of a pharmacological agent should be individualized based on its efficacy, side effect profile, patient comorbidities, and access, always used as an adjunct to, not a replacement for, ongoing lifestyle modifications. According to current clinical practice guidelines, people with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥ 30 kg/m 2 or ≥ 27 kg/m 2 who also have at least one weight-related comorbidity (such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, or obstructive sleep apnea) should generally be evaluated for AOMs. Efficacy, safety profile, possible adverse effects, patient comorbidities and preferences, contraindications, drug interactions, cost, and accessibility should all be considered when choosing an AOM (Table 2). Detailed information on specific agents is provided in Supplementary Table 3.

### Efficacy and safety of the dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide for weight loss: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111nd63n]. International Journal of Obesity (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Tirzepatide is a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist approved for type 2 diabetes. We performed a meta-analysis to assess tirzepatide's weight reduction efficacy and safety.

Methods

We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane for randomized controlled trials published from inception to July 2022, comparing tirzepatide with placebo for the co-primary endpoints of absolute and percent change in weight. Mean difference (MD) and odds ratio (OR) were calculated for continuous and binary outcomes, respectively. Review Manager 5.4.1 and RStudio were used for the statistical analysis, and RoB-2 (Cochrane) to assess the risk of bias.

Results

Of 397 search results, 6 studies (4036 participants) ranging from 12 to 72 weeks were included. Pooled analysis showed that tirzepatide 5mg, 10mg, and 15mg were more effective than placebo, with MD in body weight of -7.7kg (95% CI -11.0, -4.4; p < 0.001), -11.6kg (95% CI -18.8, -4.3; p = 0.002), and -11.8kg (95% CI -17.4, -6.2; p < 0.001), respectively, and MD in percent change in weight of -8.1% (95% CI -11.0, -5.2; p < 0.001), -11.9% (95% CI -18.1, -5.6; p < 0.001), and -12.4% (95% CI -17.2, -7.5; p < 0.001), respectively. Tirzepatide also reduced BMI and waist circumference. Adverse events were more common with tirzepatide with respect to nausea (OR 4.2; 95% CI 2.4, 7.5; p < 0.001), vomiting (OR 7.0; 95% CI 4.3, 11.4; p < 0.001), and diarrhea (OR 2.8; 95% CI 1.6, 4.9; p < 0.001) (15mg dose), when compared with placebo.

Conclusions

The results support that tirzepatide leads to substantial weight reduction and constitutes a valuable therapeutic option for weight management, despite an increase in gastrointestinal symptoms.

### GLP-1 receptor agonists: an updated review of head-to-head clinical studies [^116mrJ8R]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) are attractive options for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) because they effectively lower A1C and weight while having a low risk of hypoglycemia. Some also have documented cardiovascular benefit. The GLP-1 RA class has grown in the last decade, with several agents available for use in the United States and Europe. Since the efficacy and tolerability, dosing frequency, administration requirements, and cost may vary between agents within the class, each agent may offer unique advantages and disadvantages. Through a review of phaseIII clinical trials studying dulaglutide, exenatide twice daily, exenatide once weekly, liraglutide, lixisenatide, semaglutide, and oral semaglutide, 14 head-to-head trials were identified that evaluated the safety and efficacy of GLP-1 RA active comparators. The purpose of this review is to provide an analysis of these trials. The GLP-1 RA head-to-head clinical studies have demonstrated that all GLP-1 RA agents are effective therapeutic options at reducing A1C. However, differences exist in terms of magnitude of effect on A1C and weight as well as frequency of adverse effects.

### The role of tirzepatide, dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist, in the management of type 2 diabetes: the SURPASS clinical trials [^114arUiH]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) based therapy is an established treatment option for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and is recommended early in the treatment algorithm owing to glycaemic efficacy, weight reduction and favourable cardiovascular outcomes. Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), on the other hand, was thought to have no potential as a glucose-lowering therapy because of observations showing no insulinotropic effect from supraphysiological infusion in people with T2DM. However, emerging evidence has illustrated that co-infusion of GLP-1 and GIP has a synergetic effect, resulting in significantly increased insulin response and glucagonostatic response, compared with separate administration of each hormone. These observations have led to the development of a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist, known as a 'twincretin'. Tirzepatide is a novel dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist formulated as a synthetic peptide containing 39 amino acids, based on the native GIP sequence. Pre-clinical trials and phase 1 and 2 clinical trials indicate that tirzepatide has potent glucose lowering and weight loss with adverse effects comparable to those of established GLP-1 receptor agonists. The long-term efficacy, safety and cardiovascular outcomes of tirzepatide will be investigated in the SURPASS phase 3 clinical trial programme. In this paper, we will review the pre-clinical and phase 1 and 2 trials for tirzepatide in the management of T2DM and give an overview of the SURPASS clinical trials.

Critical outcomes

Resting systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure (mmHg) measured at short‐term (between 3 and 12 weeks), medium‐term (between 3 and 12 months) and long‐term (beyond 12 months)

We selected these pragmatic time frames for the following reasons: short‐term is expected to be related to any direct blood pressure effect of the drug itself; medium‐term is expected to reflect the indirect effect via weight loss; and long‐term is expected to show if the blood pressure effects are sustained or transient, as suggested in a previous trial.

The preferred measure of the outcome will be resting (and sitting) clinic measurement. We will use home blood pressure measurement if no clinic measurement is available. The preferred measurement of the outcome will be using an oscillometric technique. We will use an auscultatory technique if no oscillometric measurement is available.

In line with a previous Cochrane protocol, if more than one blood pressure measurement is reported during one treatment period, we will use the weighted mean of the blood pressure measurements to optimize use of the available data for the corresponding treatment period. The preferred measure of blood pressure change will be the change from baseline versus control (i.e. the difference, between experimental and control intervention, in change from baseline). If the change is not reported, we will use the end of treatment blood pressure value of the experimental versus the control intervention to calculate the pooled difference.

It should be noted that this review will be limited to the assessment of the blood pressure effect. Blood pressure is often used as a surrogate for cardiovascular prevention, but a benefit on blood pressure only suggests a potential clinical benefit that remains to be demonstrated. Previous Cochrane reviews addressed the issue of blood pressure targets, for example in adults with hypertension.

Important outcomes

Heart rate (beats per minute, resting), weight (kilograms) and body mass index (weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared): changes at the same time periods as blood pressure measurements and defined as for the blood pressure outcomes (preferably difference in change from baseline, if not available, then difference in end of treatment value).
Withdrawal due to adverse effects and serious adverse events: over the duration of the study. It should be noted that we classified these safety outcomes under secondary outcomes because the review's primary concern is the blood pressure effect. However, adverse events of any type are crucial, especially for drugs that are relatively new and with proven intolerance.

### Incretin-based therapy for diabetes: what a cardiologist needs to know [^114qqwyE]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Incretin-based therapies are effective glucose-lowering drugs that have an increasing role in the treatment of type 2 diabetes because of their efficacy, safety, and ease of use. Both glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors are commonly used for glycemic control as adjuncts to metformin, other oral antiglycemic agents, or insulin. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists may have additional effects, such as weight loss, that may be advantageous in obese patients. There is a large body of evidence from randomized controlled clinical trials supporting the cardiovascular safety of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and some glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, at least in the short term. However, concerns have been raised, particularly regarding their safety in patients with heart failure. In this review, the authors provide a brief but practical evidence-based analysis of the use of incretin-based agents in patients with diabetes, their efficacy, and cardiovascular safety.

Tirzepatide is the first ever once-weekly, injectable gastric inhibitory peptide/glucagon-like peptide 1 (GIP/GLP-1) dual agonist approved by the European Medicines Agency for type 2 diabetes. The efficacy and safety of tirzepatide have been evaluated in five global, randomized, double-blind or open-label, phase 3 studies which enrolled over 7000 people living with type 2 diabetes, across various stages of disease and with different characteristics at baseline. In this short commentary we report the salient data of the most recent trials on tirzepatide and GLP-1 receptor agonists from a clinical point of view, with the aim of highlighting similarities and mutual differences.

Investigation of heterogeneity and subgroup analysis

We will assess methodological heterogeneity by describing the proportion of each time point of the critical outcome (how many trials report the short‐term, medium‐term and long‐term critical outcome). We will assess clinical heterogeneity by describing the proportions of each indication of the intervention (how many trials investigating the intervention in diabetes, in obesity, etc.). We expect enough similarity in studies to conduct meta‐analysis, but we will report an assessment of the heterogeneity using the I 2 statistic. We plan the following subgroup analyses to assess potential heterogeneity related to:

participants (subgroups: healthy versus non‐healthy, as defined in Types of participants);
drugs (subgroups: each included drug comparisons, i.e. each dual GIP/GLP‐1 receptor agonist versus each peptide GLP‐1 receptor agonist, doses and administration form pooled for each drug; rather than drug classes comparisons).

Indeed, the blood pressure effect of the GLP‐1 receptor agonist class might vary depending on the GLP‐1 receptor agonist used. For example, an increased diastolic blood pressure has been reported with liraglutide, but not with others such as dulaglutide. All P values will be considered as 'significant' at the 5% threshold without multiple testing correction, even for the subgroup interaction tests.

Equity‐related assessment

It has been well documented that lower socioeconomic position is associated with higher adult body mass index and increased obesity risk. Better understanding the effect of weight management drugs might help to address such health inequity issues. Gender differences in the regulation of blood pressure have also been reported. We will report the description of the socioeconomic status and the gender of the participants in the included trials.

Sensitivity analysis

We will assess the robustness of the pooled estimates using sensitivity analysis as follows.

Restricted to trials at overall low risk of bias

### Targeting GLP-1 receptor trafficking to improve agonist efficacy [^117QzHHL]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) activation promotes insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells, causes weight loss, and is an important pharmacological target in type 2 diabetes (T2D). Like other G protein-coupled receptors, the GLP-1R undergoes agonist-mediated endocytosis, but the functional and therapeutic consequences of modulating GLP-1R endocytic trafficking have not been clearly defined. Here, we investigate a series of biased GLP-1R agonists with variable propensities for GLP-1R internalization and recycling. Compared to a panel of FDA-approved GLP-1 mimetics, compounds that retain GLP-1R at the plasma membrane produce greater long-term insulin release, which is dependent on a reduction in β-arrestin recruitment and faster agonist dissociation rates. Such molecules elicit glycemic benefits in mice without concomitant increases in signs of nausea, a common side effect of GLP-1 therapies. Our study identifies a set of agents with specific GLP-1R trafficking profiles and the potential for greater efficacy and tolerability as T2D treatments.

### Efficacy and safety of tirzepatide, dual GLP-1 / GIP receptor agonists, in the management of type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^115K6GtV]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

We identified three previous systematic review and meta-analysis with tirzepatide treatment for T2DM, which included four (2783 participants), seven (6609 participants) and six trials (3484 participants), respectively, thorough literature retrieve and review. Discrepancies of include literatures and research methodology render the results of these meta-analysis non-comparable to our findings. Specifically, Bhagavathula et al. summarized the efficacy results in meta-analysis, regardless of the type of comparators (insulin, GLP-1 Ras or placebo). In the meta-analysis of Thomas Karagiannis and colleagues, no analysis was performed on the efficacy of blood glucose and blood lipid. The three articles have important limitation of insufficient literature. Dutta, D and colleagues did not analysis base on therapeutic doses and comparators. Given the availability of new outcomes data and relative importance of this study, we have updated this previous literature search and meta-analysis. Instead, we opted to summary and synthesis systematic review results and produce meta-analysis estimates with potential clinical relevance and value by conducting separate analysis based on different therapeutic doses (5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg) and type of comparators for HbA 1c, FBG, BW and lipid outcomes with included all RCTs of tirzepatide in the treatment of T2DM published to date. Moreover, the present meta-analysis provides a comprehensive assessment of safety and tolerability results, which is also important the evaluation of efficacy when opting an optimal therapy in clinical treatment.

### Blood pressure lowering efficacy of dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide / glucagon-like peptide-1 (GIP / GLP-1) receptor agonists compared to glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists [^116qMgeJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Dual GIP/GLP‐1 receptor agonists decrease systolic and diastolic blood pressure in people with type 2 diabetes, and in people with a body mass index of 27 kg/m 2 or greater without type 2 diabetes. GLP‐1 receptor agonists might decrease systolic blood pressure in people with type 2 diabetes, and in people without type 2 diabetes, but might increase diastolic blood pressure in people with type 2 diabetes. It is unclear why GLP‐1 receptor agonists would have a differential effect on systolic blood pressure versus diastolic blood pressure. Effects on extracellular volume homeostasis and arterial stiffness have been suggested to explain a better effect of GLP‐1 receptor agonists on systolic blood pressure. Head‐to‐head trials of dual GIP/GLP‐1 receptor agonists and GLP‐1 receptor agonists in people with type 2 diabetes reported changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure within each arm (compared to their respective baseline) but without formal between‐arm comparisons. In type 2 diabetes, one meta‐analysis reported a reduction in systolic blood pressure when pooling all GLP‐1 receptor agonists and dual GIP/GLP‐1 receptor agonists compared to insulin (mean difference [MD] −3.7 mmHg, 95% confidence interval [CI] −4.3 to −3.1), that was most prominent in the comparison of tirzepatide versus basal insulin treatment (MD −5.6 mmHg, −6.4 to −4.8); and suggested a subgroup difference between dual GIP/GLP‐1 receptor agonists and long‐acting GLP‐1 receptor agonists when compared to basal insulin (the heterogeneity of the incretin effect compared to insulin was substantial with an I 2 statistic of 72%), but without formal indirect comparison. They reported similar findings for the effect on diastolic blood pressure (however, with no significant differences for the pooled GLP‐1 receptor agonists treatments).

### Therapy in the early stage: incretins [^112aog2A]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

The complex pathological mechanisms responsible for development of type 2 diabetes are not fully addressed by conventional drugs, which are also associated with inconvenient side effects such as weight gain or hypoglycemia. Two types of incretin-based therapies are now in use: incretin mimetics (glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1] receptor agonists that bind specific receptors and mimic the action of natural GLP-1) and incretin enhancers (inhibitors of the enzyme that degrade the incretin hormones and thus prolong their activity). Both offer important advantages over previous agents. In addition to the proven glucose-lowering efficacy, they promote weight loss (or are weight neutral) by slowing gastric emptying and inducing satiety, inhibit glucagon secretion with maintenance of counterregulatory mechanisms, and exhibit cardiovascular benefits, while having a low risk profile. Importantly, short-term studies have shown that incretins/incretin-based therapies protect β-cells (by enhancing cell proliferation and differentiation and inhibiting apoptosis) and stimulate their function (by recruiting β-cells to the secretory process and increasing insulin biosynthesis/secretion). These therapies have the opportunity to interfere with the disease progression if used as an early intervention, when enough β-cell mass/function can still be preserved or restored.

### Targeting the incretin / glucagon system with triagonists to treat diabetes [^113zbWgK]. Endocrine Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Glucagonlike peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists have been efficacious for the treatment of type 2 diabetes due to their ability to reduce weight and attenuate hyperglycemia. However, the activity of glucagonlike peptide 1 receptor-directed strategies is submaximal, and the only potent, sustainable treatment of metabolic dysfunction is bariatric surgery, necessitating the development of unique therapeutics. GLP-1 is structurally related to glucagon and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), allowing for the development of intermixed, unimolecular peptides with activity at each of their respective receptors. In this review, we discuss the range of tissue targets and added benefits afforded by the inclusion of each of GIP and glucagon. We discuss considerations for the development of sequence-intermixed dual agonists and triagonists, highlighting the importance of evaluating balanced signaling at the targeted receptors. Several multireceptor agonist peptides have been developed and evaluated, and the key preclinical and clinical findings are reviewed in detail. The biological activity of these multireceptor agonists are founded in the success of GLP-1-directed strategies; by including GIP and glucagon components, these multireceptor agonists are thought to enhance GLP-1's activities by broadening the tissue targets and synergizing at tissues that express multiple receptors, such at the brain and pancreatic islet β cells. The development and utility of balanced, unimolecular multireceptor agonists provide both a useful tool for querying the actions of incretins and glucagon during metabolic disease and a unique drug class to treat type 2 diabetes with unprecedented efficacy.

### Real-world evidence on the utilization, clinical and comparative effectiveness, and adverse effects of newer GLP-1RA-based weight-loss therapies [^113GwpK6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

6 CONCLUSIONS

Real‐world evidence supports the effectiveness of GLP‐1RA for weight loss, but the observed weight reduction in therapy initiators overall tends to be lower than in randomised controlled trials, likely due to lower adherence, persistence and the use of reduced doses in clinical practice. Semaglutide and tirzepatide starters appear to achieve the greatest weight loss, with emerging data suggesting that real‐world outcomes may approach those seen in trials among highly adherent patients. Adverse events, particularly gastrointestinal disturbances, frequently lead to discontinuation, but otherwise, real‐world data provide little evidence for severe adverse effects. Adverse events in the obesity population and, in particular, long‐term safety outcomes remain insufficiently studied. Future research should focus on comparative effectiveness, long‐term clinical impacts, treatment discontinuation effects and cost‐effectiveness to optimise the real‐world application of these therapies. Addressing these gaps will be crucial for refining clinical guidelines, ensuring equitable access and guiding future pharmacological strategies for obesity management.
