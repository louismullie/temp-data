## Question

Indication of FNA in thyroid nodules

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the indications for fine-needle aspiration (FNA) in thyroid nodules. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational principle that FNA is the procedure of choice when clinically indicated. Then, I should verify how ultrasound risk stratification drives size thresholds. Next, I will examine special scenarios like multiple nodules, cystic nodules, and cervical lymph nodes. After that, I need to check functional nodules and PET findings. I will then review pediatric, pregnancy, and very small nodules. Finally, I should confirm technique preferences, cytology reporting, and how to handle indeterminate results, including molecular testing, before summarizing a practical decision framework.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principle so I don't jump to conclusions: FNA is the most accurate and cost-effective method to evaluate thyroid nodules when clinically indicated, and ultrasound guidance improves diagnostic yield compared to palpation-based FNA, so I should anchor on that before discussing thresholds [^893bb7c2] [^d4bc269f].

> Next, I should review how ultrasound risk stratification modifies size thresholds, and I need to double-check the ATA cutoffs. High-suspicion sonographic patterns carry a malignancy risk around 70–90%, and FNA is recommended at ≥ 1 cm; intermediate-suspicion patterns around 10–20% risk also warrant FNA at ≥ 1 cm; low-suspicion patterns around 5–10% suggest FNA at ≥ 1.5 cm; very low-suspicion patterns under 3% risk allow consideration of FNA at ≥ 2 cm, with observation as a reasonable alternative; purely cystic nodules are benign and FNA is not indicated for diagnosis, though aspiration may be done for symptomatic relief [^58194b6e] [^ab050965] [^629b6f0f].

> Hold on, I should verify the European perspective to ensure consistency. The 2023 ETA guidance aligns with a risk-adapted approach using EU-TIRADS, recommending FNA for EU-TIRADS 5 at > 10 mm, EU-TIRADS 4 at > 15 mm, and EU-TIRADS 3 at > 20 mm, which mirrors the principle of smaller thresholds for higher-risk sonographic patterns [^0a97f9e3].

> I will now examine multiple nodules, because I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing from solitary nodule rules. Each nodule ≥ 1 cm is evaluated independently based on its own sonographic risk, and FNA should prioritize the nodule with the highest suspicion pattern; if no nodule has high or moderate suspicion and multiple similar very low or low suspicion nodules coalesce, it is reasonable to aspirate the largest nodules (≥ 2 cm) or continue surveillance, and in patients with low or low-normal TSH, a radionuclide scan can help identify hyperfunctioning nodules that typically do not require FNA [^496adc46] [^f0430e4a] [^56031f7c].

> Wait, let me verify cystic nodules and how to handle them. Purely cystic nodules are benign and FNA is not indicated for diagnosis; for complex cystic nodules, I should target the solid/vascularized component for FNA to maximize diagnostic yield and avoid nondiagnostic samples from fluid alone [^629b6f0f] [^d1db4a84].

> Next, I should review cervical lymph nodes, because nodal disease changes surgical planning. Ultrasound-guided FNA of suspicious cervical nodes ≥ 8–10 mm is recommended when results would alter management, and measuring thyroglobulin or calcitonin in nodal washouts can aid diagnosis in selected scenarios, particularly when metastatic papillary or medullary carcinoma is suspected [^3db53693] [^239575ee] [^94b374cb].

> I need to check functional nodules and PET findings so I don't misapply FNA. Hyperfunctioning nodules on scintigraphy are unlikely to be malignant and generally do not require FNA; conversely, focal 18F-FDG-PET uptake in a thyroid nodule increases malignancy risk and supports FNA at ≥ 1 cm, whereas diffuse FDG uptake from chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis does not by itself mandate FNA [^8efcfaf6] [^ab9dcd05] [^41b47b89].

> But wait, what if the nodule is very small or the patient is high risk? For nodules < 5 mm, surveillance with ultrasound is preferred over FNA given low clinical risk; for 5–10 mm nodules, FNA may be considered only with suspicious ultrasound features plus high-risk clinical factors such as subcapsular/paratracheal location, suspicious nodes, personal/family history of thyroid cancer, or concerning symptoms like dysphonia; in children and adolescents, FNA is less reliable and excision may be favored in select contexts, and in pregnancy, FNA is appropriate for clinically relevant nodules in euthyroid or hypothyroid patients, with deferral when TSH is suppressed beyond 16 weeks [^0178388d] [^fb293579] [^523b9eea].

> I should confirm technique and reporting standards to minimize inadequate samples. Ultrasound guidance is preferred, especially for nonpalpable or heterogeneous nodules, and the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology should be used to classify results into six categories; for nondiagnostic cytology, repeating FNA with ultrasound guidance and, when available, on-site adequacy assessment increases diagnostic yield to roughly 60–80% [^893bb7c2] [^b563ef1a] [^0e3693e0].

> Hold on, I should verify how to handle indeterminate cytology because this is where overtreatment risk is highest. For Bethesda III (AUS/FLUS) and IV (FN/SFN), repeat FNA, molecular testing, or diagnostic lobectomy are acceptable strategies, with molecular classifiers demonstrating high negative predictive value and potential to avert surgery in a substantial proportion of patients; shared decision-making that incorporates clinical risk, sonographic pattern, and patient preference is essential [^063edac9] [^fa153cba] [^0108f9d4].

> Let me reconsider the overall decision framework to ensure internal consistency. FNA is indicated when a nodule meets size thresholds based on ultrasound risk, when there are suspicious cervical nodes, or when there are high-risk clinical features; FNA is not indicated for purely cystic nodules, hyperfunctioning nodules without suspicious features, or very small nodules without red flags; when thresholds are borderline or patient risk is atypical, observation with interval ultrasound is reasonable, and technique matters — use ultrasound guidance and Bethesda reporting to optimize diagnostic yield and downstream management [^58194b6e] [^496adc46] [^893bb7c2].

---

FNA is indicated for thyroid nodules based on **ultrasound risk and size** [^58194b6e] and **clinical risk factors**. Use **ultrasound guidance** to improve accuracy and reduce nondiagnostic results [^893bb7c2] [^d4bc269f]. FNA is not indicated for purely cystic nodules [^629b6f0f], hyperfunctioning nodules [^8efcfaf6], or nodules < 1 cm without high-risk features [^58194b6e]. For multiple nodules, prioritize FNA for the largest or most suspicious nodule(s) [^496adc46] [^2f25079c]. In pregnancy, FNA is safe when indicated [^523b9eea]; in children, use adult criteria but apply a lower threshold for surgery if malignancy is suspected [^notfound].

---

## Indications for FNA based on ultrasound features and nodule size

The ATA provides **clear recommendations** on when to perform FNA based on ultrasound features and nodule size [^58194b6e]:

| **Ultrasound risk category** | **Malignancy risk** | **Recommended FNA size threshold** |
|-|-|-|
| High suspicion (e.g. solid, hypoechoic, microcalcifications, taller-than-wide, irregular margins) | 70–90% | ≥ 1 cm |
| Intermediate suspicion (e.g. solid, hypoechoic, smooth margins) | 10–20% | ≥ 1 cm |
| Low suspicion (e.g. isoechoic or hyperechoic, solid or partially cystic) | 5–10% | ≥ 1.5 cm |
| Very low suspicion (e.g. spongiform, purely cystic) | < 3% | ≥ 2 cm (consider observation without FNA) |

---

FNA is **not indicated** for purely cystic nodules [^629b6f0f] or nodules < 1 cm without high-risk features [^58194b6e].

---

## Clinical risk factors influencing FNA indication

Several **clinical factors** may lower the threshold for FNA:

- **Family history**: Personal or family history of thyroid cancer [^0735b579].
- **Radiation exposure**: History of head and neck irradiation [^0178388d].
- **Suspicious symptoms**: Hoarseness, dysphagia, or compressive symptoms [^0735b579].
- **Rapid growth**: Nodules increasing in size [^b398452e].

---

## Special considerations

### Multiple nodules

In patients with multiple nodules, **prioritize FNA** for the largest or most suspicious nodule(s) based on ultrasound features [^496adc46] [^2f25079c]. Each nodule ≥ 1 cm is evaluated independently [^f0430e4a].

---

### Pediatric patients

In children and adolescents, apply **adult criteria** [^notfound], but use a lower threshold for surgical intervention if malignancy is suspected.

---

### Pregnancy

FNA is **safe during pregnancy** and should be performed when clinically indicated [^523b9eea]. For suppressed TSH, defer FNA until after pregnancy and lactation if possible [^523b9eea].

---

## Contraindications and limitations

FNA is **contraindicated or not recommended** in the following scenarios:

- **Hyperfunctioning nodules**: Nodules functional on scintigraphy [^8efcfaf6].
- **Very small nodules**: < 1 cm without high-risk features [^58194b6e].
- **Purely cystic nodules**: No solid component [^629b6f0f].

---

## Role of ultrasound guidance

Ultrasound guidance is **strongly recommended** for FNA because it improves accuracy, reduces nondiagnostic results, and enables sampling of nonpalpable or complex nodules [^893bb7c2] [^d4bc269f].

---

## Summary of indications

FNA is indicated for thyroid nodules based on **ultrasound risk features and size**, with lower thresholds for high-risk features and higher thresholds for low-risk features. Clinical risk factors may lower the threshold for FNA. FNA is not indicated for purely cystic nodules, hyperfunctioning nodules, or very small nodules without high-risk features. Ultrasound guidance improves diagnostic accuracy and should be used whenever feasible [^893bb7c2].

### US-guided fine-needle aspiration of thyroid nodules: indications, techniques, results [^d4bc269f]. Radiographics (2008). Low credibility.

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of thyroid nodules is minimally invasive and safe and is usually performed on an outpatient basis. However, the optimal application of FNA requires not only technical skill but also an awareness of the limitations of the procedure, the indications for its use, the factors that affect the adequacy of the biopsy specimen, and the postprocedural management strategy. Ultrasonographic (US) features that are considered indications for FNA include single and multiple thyroid nodules. The results of FNA biopsy are operator dependent. In addition, the results may be affected by the lesion characteristics, the accuracy of lesion and needle localization, the method of guidance, the number of aspirated samples, the needle gauge, the aspiration technique, and the presence or absence of on-site facilities for immediate cytologic examination. With regard to postprocedural management, nodules that are diagnosed as benign on the basis of an adequate FNA specimen should be monitored with follow-up US. Circumstances that necessitate repeat FNA include sample inadequacy, nodule enlargement, cyst recurrence, or clinical or imaging findings that arouse suspicion about the presence of a malignancy even when cytologic findings in the biopsy specimen indicate benignity.

### Thyroid fine-needle aspiration biopsy: progress, practice, and pitfalls [^9a9b0ff7]. Endocrine Practice (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an updated review of the current progress in, and the practice and pitfalls of, thyroid fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy.

Methods

The medical literature on the topic was reviewed, and the current methods, advantages, and controversies concerning FNA biopsy of thyroid nodules are summarized.

Results

Thyroid nodules are a common clinical problem, with an estimated prevalence ranging from 19 to 35%. Most thyroid cancers manifest as thyroid nodules; however, only a small fraction of all thyroid nodules harbor malignant disease. Certain clinical features increase the likelihood of malignant involvement, but the absence of such features does not exclude the possibility of cancer. Of all currently available methods of evaluating nodular thyroid disease, FNA biopsy has been found to have the greatest diagnostic accuracy, approaching 95%, and its widespread use has resulted in substantial cost savings and has allowed a much better selection of patients in need of surgical treatment. The procedure, however, has two major limitations: nondiagnostic yield and indeterminate results. The approach to the management of patients with thyroid nodules is summarized.

Conclusion

FNA is the most reliable and cost-effective method of distinguishing benign from suspicious or malignant thyroid nodules.

### Thyroid aspiration cytology: current status [^bee5f6f7]. CA (2009). Low credibility.

In the adult population, thyroid nodules are common and are increasingly detected by ultrasound examination or other scanning techniques. Depending on their size and ultrasonographic features, these nodules may require further investigation, including tissue diagnosis. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) has become the predominant method to obtain tissue for microscopic analysis. In October 2007, the National Cancer Institute sponsored a conference to review the state of the science for the use of FNA in the management of thyroid nodules. This conference reviewed indications for thyroid FNA and pre-FNA requirements, training and credentialing, techniques for thyroid FNA, diagnostic terminology and morphologic criteria, utilization of ancillary studies, and post-FNA testing and treatment options. The results of those discussions have been published in both print and electronic versions. The aim of the current article was to discuss indications for FNA, diagnostic terminology, and post-FNA options, issues that are important to physicians who are managing patients with thyroid nodules.

American Thyroid Association (ATA) 2015 — Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) use (Recommendation 7) states that FNA is the procedure of choice in the evaluation of thyroid nodules, when clinically indicated (Strong recommendation, High-quality evidence). FNA is described as the most accurate and cost-effective method for evaluating thyroid nodules, with retrospective studies reporting lower rates of both nondiagnostic and false-negative cytology from FNA performed using US guidance compared to palpation; accordingly, for nodules with a higher likelihood of nondiagnostic cytology or sampling error, US-guided FNA is preferred, although if a predominantly solid correlating nodule is confirmed on US, the FNA may be performed using palpation or US guidance.

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) versus surveillance — patient selection: Most thyroid nodules meeting the preceding sonographic patterns and sizes should undergo FNA, but a conservative approach of active surveillance management may be appropriate as an alternative to FNA in selected patients, which may include patients with very low-risk tumors, patients at surgical risk, or those with a relatively short life span expectancy in whom the benefits of intervention may be unrealized.

### Fine-needle aspiration in the work-up of thyroid nodules [^a9aeaebe]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is the crucial diagnostic test used for the evaluation of patients with a thyroid nodule. The result of an FNA determines if a patient can be followed with repeated examinations or referred for surgery. The value of FNA can be enhanced by attention to technical details. Communication between operator and pathologist is essential. A pathologist's interpretation is aided if essential clinical information is provided on a requisition form. Although reporting terminology has been varied and confusing in the past, a proposal for a uniform reporting system provides 6 clearly defined and clinically relevant reporting categories and promises to standardize the reporting of thyroid FNA results.

### Systematic review of clinical practice guidelines in the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and cancer [^64fe64cc]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Given the uncertainties regarding thyroid nodule assessment and management, physicians require systematically and transparently developed recommendations. This systematic review assesses the quality and consistency of the recommendations of international clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and cancer to assist physicians in making appropriate recommendations.

Methods

The CPGs on the management of thyroid nodules and cancer published before June 2013 were retrieved. All the reviewed guidelines were in English. Four reviewers independently assessed the rigor of guideline development by using the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation II (AGREE-II) instrument, and their reported evidence was evaluated.

Results

Ten eligible guidelines were included: nine had been developed by professional organizations, and the remaining guideline was endorsed by an independent regional body. Three guidelines achieved a score of greater than 50% in all six AGREE-II domains. Guidelines scored highest on the measurement of 'scope and purpose' (≥ 61.1% for eight CPGs) and lowest on the measurement of 'applicability' (≤ 38.5% for five CPGs). The overall quality ranged from 3.0 to 6.25 on a seven-point scale on the AGREE-II tool. Most CPG recommendations on the management of thyroid cancer were relatively consistent. Guidelines varied regarding the indication of fine-needle aspiration for thyroid nodules, as well as in their suggestions for postoperative radioiodine ablation.

Conclusions

Our analysis showed that the current CPGs varied in methodological quality. More effort is needed to improve the quality of recommendations on the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and cancer.

### Systematic review of clinical practice guidelines in the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and cancer [^0ee2245d]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Thyroid nodules are a common clinical problem. They are more common in women, and their incidence increases with age. Epidemiologic studies have shown the prevalence of palpable thyroid nodules in iodine-sufficient parts of the world to be approximately 5% in women and 1% in men. Thyroid nodules are clinically important because they can indicate thyroid cancer, which occurs in 5% to 15% of the population, depending on age, sex, history of radiation exposure, family history, and other factors. Thyroid cancer is the most common malignant endocrine tumor, but represents approximately 1% of all malignancies. Differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), which includes papillary and follicular cancer, comprises the vast majority (90%) of all thyroid cancers.

The standard for the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and cancer is still inconclusive. Several theories and practices, including the indication of fine-needle aspiration (FNA), the role of the thyroid scan, the extension of thyroid surgery for DTC, the role of cervical lymph-node dissection, and the indication of radioiodine ablation (I 131), are questionable. These issues need to be clearly addressed by valid, reliable, independent, and easily applicable clinical practice guidelines (CPGs). Several notable organizations have developed guidelines containing recommendations for thyroid nodules and cancer management. However, guidelines on the same topic can conflict with each other, and the quality and independence of the guidelines are of concern. Therefore, clinicians require guidelines that are systematically developed, and that provide transparent estimates of the benefits and harms of interventions.

The Appraisal of Guidelines, Research, and Evaluation (AGREE) instrument is a tool used for thoroughly assessing the quality of guidelines. The original AGREE instrument was published in 2003 by a group of international guideline developers and researchers, the AGREE Collaboration. The updated version, the AGREE-II instrument, was released in 2010 and was funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. AGREE has become the standard in the evaluation and development of CPGs. Using the AGREE-II instrument, we systematically reviewed and assessed the quality and consistency of the recommendations of CPGs on the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and cancer.

American Thyroid Association (ATA) management guidelines for thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer — scope, methods, and key recommendation areas are outlined, stating that the aim is to inform clinicians, patients, researchers, and health policy makers on evidence for diagnosis and management. The clinical questions were based on prior guideline versions and stakeholder and task force input, with eligibility limited to published English-language adult articles, and evidence appraisal and recommendation grading for therapeutic interventions used the American College of Physicians Guideline Grading System; competing interests were regularly updated, managed, and communicated. Recommendation areas for thyroid nodules include initial evaluation, clinical and ultrasound criteria for fine-needle aspiration biopsy, interpretation of fine-needle aspiration biopsy results, use of molecular markers, and management of benign nodules, while initial thyroid cancer management recommendations include screening for thyroid cancer, staging and risk assessment, surgical management, radioiodine remnant ablation and therapy, and thyrotropin suppression therapy using levothyroxine.

### Approach to the patient with a cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodule [^10a6f7df]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Fine-needle aspiration remains the primary diagnostic intervention for the evaluation of most thyroid nodules larger than 1–1.5 cm. Although most aspirates provide diagnostic cytology, approximately 15–25% will be classified indeterminate (often referred to as follicular neoplasm, suspicious for carcinoma, or atypical). In such cases, abnormal cellular findings preclude interpretation of benignity, although only a minority will prove cancerous upon final histopathology. Nonetheless, patients with indeterminate aspirates are commonly referred for consideration of hemi- or near-total thyroidectomy. Recently, improved understanding and novel investigation of clinical, radiological, cytological, and molecular factors has allowed improved stratification of cancer risk.

Conclusion

Although surgery continues to be commonly recommended, strategies for such patients should increasingly seek to define treatment based on the estimation of an individual's thyroid cancer risk in comparison with associated operative risk and morbidity. In doing so, the rate of unnecessary surgical procedures and associated complications can be reduced.

Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNA) is the key step in selecting most patients with thyroid nodules for or against surgery. Accurate acquisition of cytologic samples from suspicious lesions is achieved by adding ultrasound guidance to optimize targeting as well as to enable sampling from nonpalpable lesions. This article discusses the indications, variations, and technical details of ultrasound-guided FNA.

### Fine-needle aspiration of thyroid nodules: past, present, and future [^14668fcd]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To present a review of the traditional and more recent techniques and applications of thyroid fine-needle aspiration biopsy.

Methods

We describe the cytologic features and differential diagnoses of various thyroid lesions, outline recommendations for diagnostic categories, and discuss new techniques that have shown some promise in the diagnosis of thyroid nodule fine-needle aspiration specimens.

Results

Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the thyroid has proved to be an excellent diagnostic tool in the initial management of thyroid nodules. Numerous studies have shown its high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing malignant tumors of the thyroid, especially papillary thyroid carcinoma. As with other diagnostic tests, however, its effectiveness is highly dependent on the expertise of the operator performing the procedure and the adequacy of the specimen for interpretation of the cytomorphologic features. On-site evaluation of thyroid specimens promotes adequate specimen sampling and reduces the incidence of nondiagnostic specimens. Diagnostic reports on thyroid fine-needle aspiration should include patient demographics and pertinent clinical history, site and size of the thyroid nodule, mode of aspiration, number of needle passes, assessment of specimen adequacy, diagnosis, and recommendations. Although immunohistochemical and molecular markers have received considerable attention recently, additional studies are needed before they can be used to separate benign from malignant follicular thyroid lesions.

Conclusion

Overall, fine-needle aspiration biopsy of thyroid nodules has proved to be sensitive, specific, and well accepted by patients because of minimal discomfort and complications.

### Thyroid nodules: advances in evaluation and management… [^35e1fdd6]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyperfunctioning nodules are unlikely to be malignant and do not require FNA. Nonfunctioning or "cold" nodules should be further evaluated with FNA if they meet clinical or ultrasound criteria. FNA can be considered for younger patients or if the patient requests it. 11 Conversely, pure cystic nodules are rarely malignant and do not require evaluation with FNA. Spongiform and predominantly cystic nodules also have very low risk of malignancy, and biopsy should be considered only if the nodule is 2 cm or larger. 11 These nodules can also be followed with thyroid ultrasonography in 12 to 24 months without FNA. FNA has a vital role in risk stratification of thyroid nodules. 7 The American Thyroid Association recommends that FNA cytopathology be reported using the six Bethesda System diagnostic categories 11, 17.

Approximately 25% of thyroid FNA samples are classified as Bethesda category 3 or 4, which are considered cytologically indeterminate 18 and have a malignancy risk of 5% to 30%. 11 Hence, it is reasonable to reevaluate larger thyroid nodules that were benign on FNA with follow-up ultrasonography at 12 to 24 months. Primary care physicians should have a low threshold for surgical referral if the nodule shows significant growth or if follow-up ultrasonography demonstrates a new suspicious pattern. Recurrent cystic nodules with benign histology may be removed surgically or percutaneously injected with ethanol if they are symptomatic. 11 Solid nodules that are benign on repeat FNA may be followed with ultrasonography or removed surgically, depending on symptoms; however, repeat FNA is not required, even if the nodule shows growth.

11 Studies of levothyroxine suppression in benign nodules have shown some reduction in nodule size, 29 but this treatment is not recommended because the potential harm of thyrotoxicosis outweighs the benefit.
11. PATIENTS WITH MULTIPLE NODULES Because each thyroid nodule carries an independent risk of malignancy, patients with multiple nodules may require FNA for more than one nodule. Nodules with highly suspicious ultrasound features should be preferentially biopsied. A radionuclide thyroid uptake scan can be considered in patients with a low to low-normal TSH level to identify target nodules for FNA.

### Evaluation… [^fb8b22b5]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

In the past, nuclear thyroid scintigraphy was often performed to evaluate all thyroid nodules. However, nonfunctioning nodules have only a 14% to 22% chance of being malignant. Treatment Radioactive iodine 131 ablation is the first-line treatment for hyperfunctioning thyroid nodules. Because activity in the surrounding tissue is suppressed, there is little uptake of the isotope in the tissue outside the nodules, and there does not seem to be any significant damage to the remainder of the thyroid. If the pathology is malignant or suspicious, surgery to remove the affected thyroid lobe or lobes is recommended. 1, 14 Diagnostic lobectomy is often recommended for nodules 4 cm or larger because this size is an independent predictor of malignancy, and because FNA in a large nodule may miss a malignant focus and be falsely interpreted as benign. 3 Benign nodules should be followed with repeat ultrasonography six to 18 months after the initial FNA.

1, 2 If the nodules have not grown significantly at the follow-up examination, the interval may be extended to three to five years. 1, 2 If the nodule has grown, repeat FNA should be performed with ultrasound guidance. 1, 2 Recurrent cystic nodules with benign histology may be removed surgically or percutaneously injected with ethanol if they are symptomatic. 1, 2 Solid nodules that are benign on repeat FNA may be followed with ultrasonography or removed surgically, depending on symptoms. 1, 2 Studies of levothyroxine suppression in benign nodules have shown some reduction in nodule size, 18 but this treatment is generally not recommended. 1, 2. 8 The evaluation of thyroid nodules in euthyroid and hypothyroid pregnant women is the same as in other adults, including ultrasonography and FNA when indicated. 1 Levothyroxine suppression of growing nodules may be attempted, but the evidence of effectiveness is weak.

1 In pregnant women with suppressed TSH levels, workup should be deferred until after pregnancy and lactation, so that thyroid scintigraphy can be performed. FNA is less reliable in preadolescents, and excision of nodules rather than FNA is recommended. 20 In children and adolescents with a family history of thyroid cancer or MEN type 2, aggressive early prophylactic thyroidectomy is recommended for treatment of thyroid nodules. 20.

American Thyroid Association — evaluation of multinodular thyroid glands: Patients with multiple thyroid nodules ≥ 1 cm should be evaluated like solitary nodules ≥ 1 cm, recognizing that each nodule > 1 cm may require fine-needle aspiration (FNA) (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). When multiple nodules ≥ 1 cm are present, FNA should be prioritized by nodule sonographic pattern and respective size cutoff (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). If no nodule has a high or moderate suspicion pattern and multiple similar very low or low suspicion nodules coalesce without intervening normal parenchyma, it is reasonable to aspirate the largest nodules (≥ 2 cm) or continue surveillance without FNA (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). In patients with low or low-normal serum TSH and multiple nodules, a radionuclide (preferably 123I) thyroid scan should be considered and compared to ultrasound (US) images to determine functionality of nodules ≥ 1 cm, and FNA should then be considered only for isofunctioning or nonfunctioning nodules, prioritizing those with high suspicion sonographic pattern for aspiration.

Thyroid nodules are detected in up to 50 to 60% of healthy subjects. Most nodules do not cause clinically significant symptoms, and as a result, the main challenge in their management is to rule out malignancy, with ultrasonography (US) and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy serving as diagnostic cornerstones. The key issues discussed in these guidelines are as follows: (1) US-based categorization of the malignancy risk and indications for US-guided FNA (henceforth, FNA), (2) cytologic classification of FNA samples, (3) the roles of immunocytochemistry and molecular testing applied to thyroid FNA, (4) therapeutic options, and (5) follow-up strategy. Thyroid nodule management during pregnancy and in children are also addressed. On the basis of US features, thyroid nodules may be categorized into 3 groups: low-, intermediate-and high-malignancy risk. FNA should be considered for nodules ≤ 10 mm diameter only when suspicious US signs are present, while nodules ≤ 5 mm should be monitored rather than biopsied. A classification scheme of 5 categories (nondiagnostic, benign, indeterminate, suspicious for malignancy, or malignant) is recommended for the cytologic report. Indeterminate lesions are further subdivided into 2 subclasses to more accurately stratify the risk of malignancy. At present, no single cytochemical or genetic marker can definitely rule out malignancy in indeterminate nodules. Nevertheless, these tools should be considered together with clinical data, US signs, elastographic pattern, or results of other imaging techniques to improve the management of these lesions. Most thyroid nodules do not require any treatment, and levothyroxine (LT4) suppressive therapy is not recommended. Percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI) should be the first-line treatment option for relapsing, benign cystic lesions, while US-guided thermal ablation treatments may be considered for solid or mixed symptomatic benign thyroid nodules. Surgery remains the treatment of choice for malignant or suspicious nodules. The present document updates previous guidelines released in 2006 and 2010 by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE), American College of Endocrinology (ACE) and Associazione Medici Endocrinologi (AME).

Background

Thyroid nodules are a common clinical problem, and differentiated thyroid cancer is becoming increasingly prevalent. Since the American Thyroid Association's (ATA's) guidelines for the management of these disorders were revised in 2009, significant scientific advances have occurred in the field. The aim of these guidelines is to inform clinicians, patients, researchers, and health policy makers on published evidence relating to the diagnosis and management of thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer.

Methods

The specific clinical questions addressed in these guidelines were based on prior versions of the guidelines, stakeholder input, and input of task force members. Task force panel members were educated on knowledge synthesis methods, including electronic database searching, review and selection of relevant citations, and critical appraisal of selected studies. Published English language articles on adults were eligible for inclusion. The American College of Physicians Guideline Grading System was used for critical appraisal of evidence and grading strength of recommendations for therapeutic interventions. We developed a similarly formatted system to appraise the quality of such studies and resultant recommendations. The guideline panel had complete editorial independence from the ATA. Competing interests of guideline task force members were regularly updated, managed, and communicated to the ATA and task force members.

Results

The revised guidelines for the management of thyroid nodules include recommendations regarding initial evaluation, clinical and ultrasound criteria for fine-needle aspiration biopsy, interpretation of fine-needle aspiration biopsy results, use of molecular markers, and management of benign thyroid nodules. Recommendations regarding the initial management of thyroid cancer include those relating to screening for thyroid cancer, staging and risk assessment, surgical management, radioiodine remnant ablation and therapy, and thyrotropin suppression therapy using levothyroxine. Recommendations related to long-term management of differentiated thyroid cancer include those related to surveillance for recurrent disease using imaging and serum thyroglobulin, thyroid hormone therapy, management of recurrent and metastatic disease, consideration for clinical trials and targeted therapy, as well as directions for future research.

Conclusions

We have developed evidence-based recommendations to inform clinical decision-making in the management of thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer. They represent, in our opinion, contemporary optimal care for patients with these disorders.

ATA thyroid nodule/DTC guidelines — ultrasound (US) risk patterns and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) thresholds: High suspicion [malignancy risk 70%–90%] nodules with this pattern and measuring ≥ 1 cm "should undergo diagnostic fine-needle biopsy". Intermediate suspicion [malignancy risk 10%–20%] has "the highest sensitivity (60%–80%) for PTC", and "fine-needle biopsy should be considered for those nodules ≥ 1 cm". Low suspicion [malignancy risk 5%–10%] indicates that "If FNA is performed, the nodule should be at least 1.5 cm". Very low suspicion [< 3%] nodules: "If FNA is performed, the nodule should be at least 2 cm. Observation without FNA may also be considered for nodules ≥ 2 cm". Benign [≤ 1%] purely cystic nodules have FNA "not indicated for diagnostic purposes". For subcentimeter high-suspicion nodules without extrathyroidal extension or suspicious nodes, observation "may be" chosen, and age-related data from an observational series of 1235 Japanese patients show higher progression in younger patients "(5.9% vs. 2.2% for size increase; 5.3% vs. 0.4% for new nodal metastases, p < 0.05)", with "patient age and preference" modifying decisions.

### Thyroid nodule guidelines: agreement, disagreement and need for future research [^28ec0f72]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2011). Medium credibility.

This article reviews agreement, disagreement and need for future research of the thyroid nodule guidelines published by the British Thyroid Association, National Cancer Institute, American Thyroid Association and the joint, transatlantic effort of three large societies, the American Society of Clinical Endocrinologists, Associazione Medici Endocrinologi and the European Thyroid Association, published in 2010. Consensus exists for most topics in the various guidelines. A few areas of disagreement, such as the use of scintigraphy, are mostly due to differences in disease prevalence in different countries. Most of the discordance, for example, on the use of calcitonin screening or fine-needle aspiration cytology classification, could probably be resolved by further expert discussions, as the basis is the same published evidence. Importantly, owing to a current lack of evidence in many areas, clinically very relevant areas of uncertainty need to be addressed by further research. This situation applies, for instance, to better definition of ultrasound malignancy criteria and the evaluation of emerging new diagnostic and therapeutic techniques, including molecular markers. For clinicians who advise individual patients, these areas of uncertainty can currently only be resolved by sound management on the basis of clinical judgment, experience and patient preference.

### Do all thyroid nodules > 4 CM need to be removed? an evaluation of thyroid fine-needle aspiration biopsy in large thyroid nodules [^b8ba9591]. Endocrine Practice (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Controversy exists regarding the ability of fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy to rule out malignancy when thyroid nodules exceed 4 cm in diameter. The goal of this study was to provide data regarding FNA accuracy in a clinical setting for detecting/ruling out malignancy in large thyroid nodules (≥ 4 cm) and discuss FNA utility in guiding surgical decisions.

Methods

All thyroid FNA cases performed at Marshfield Clinic from 1/1/2000 to 12/31/2010 followed by complete or partial thyroidectomy on nodules of at least 4 cm were identified. Demographics, medical history, nodule biopsy characteristics, surgical procedures, and diagnosis data were abstracted. FNA was compared to histologic evaluation of surgical specimens.

Results

A total of 198 patients with large thyroid nodules were identified. Most had a single large nodule, but ~40% were multinodular, and 206 total nodules were assessed. Females outnumbered males, and the mean age was ~50 years. After surgery, cancer was histologically identified in 49/206 (23.8%) nodules, including 9/123 nodules that had been categorized as benign by FNA, corresponding to a false-negative rate of 7.3%. Sensitivity/specificity for detecting malignancy by FNA was ~80%. The positive predictive value (PPV) was just below 60%, and the negative predictive value (NPV) was 93% but rose to 96% when papillary microcarcinomas were excluded.

Conclusion

While FNA sensitivity in large nodules was relatively low, NPV was high, especially if incidental papillary microcarcinomas were excluded. When cancer prevalence and NPV are known, FNA can be a reliable "rule out" test in nodules ≥ 4 cm. This information is critical and can help guide the surgery decision, especially in high-risk patients. The decision for surgery should not be solely based on nodule size but should consider additional factors including cancer prevalence, clinical history, ultrasound features, surgical risk, and life expectancy.

Abbreviations

FNA = fine-needle aspiration NPV = negative predictive value PPV = positive predictive value.

Thyroid nodule management — How to select nodule(s) for ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA): In light of the low clinical risk, nodules with a major diameter < 5 mm should be monitored, rather than biopsied, with US. For nodules with a major diameter 5–10 mm that are associated with suspicious US signs, clinicians should consider either FNA sampling or watchful waiting on the basis of the clinical setting and patient preference. Specifically, US-guided FNA is recommended for subcapsular or paratracheal lesions, suspicious lymph nodes or extrathyroid spread, positive personal or family history of thyroid cancer, and coexistent suspicious clinical findings (e.g., dysphonia). FNA is recommended for high US risk thyroid lesions ≥ 10 mm, for intermediate US risk thyroid lesions > 20 mm, and for low US risk thyroid lesions only when > 20 mm and increasing in size or associated with a risk history and before thyroid surgery or minimally invasive ablation therapy. FNA is not recommended for nodules that are functional on scintigraphy.

### Diagnosis of thyroid nodules [^88e8b73b]. The Lancet: Diabetes & Endocrinology (2022). High credibility.

Thyroid nodules are common, usually asymptomatic, and often pose minimal risk to the affected patient. However, 10–15% prove malignant and serve as the rationale for diagnostic assessment. Safely identifying and treating a relevant thyroid cancer through a cost-effective process is the primary goal of the treating practitioner. Ultrasound is the principal means of initial nodule assessment and should be performed when any thyroid nodule is suspected. Fine-needle aspiration provides further cytological determination of benign or malignant disease and is generally applied to nodules larger than 1–2 cm in diameter, on the basis of holistic risk assessment. The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology provides standardised terminology, which enhances communication among health-care providers and patients. Benign cytology is highly accurate, whereas indeterminate cytology could benefit from further application of molecular testing. The ultimate goal of diagnostic assessment of thyroid nodules is to accurately identify malignancy while avoiding overtreatment. Low-risk thyroid nodules can be safely monitored in many patients with minimal diagnostic intervention.

For indeterminate cytologic findings, consider a second opinion from an experienced cytopathologist.

Introduction

Thyroid nodules are discrete lesions within the normal thyroid parenchyma that are benign in 90% of the cases. The reported prevalence of these nodules is 2–6% with palpation, 19–35% with ultrasonography, up to 68% with high frequency ultrasound, and 8–65% in autopsy. Despite the more common benign nature of these nodules, 5–10% of them are proven to be malignant lesions. The importance of these nodules lies in their potential for malignancy and the high burden of thyroid cancer, which necessitates early detection and assessment of these nodules.

The initial symptoms of thyroid nodules include sensation of lump or foreign body in the throat, dysphagia, hoarseness, and pain, however, most patients are asymptomatic. After a proper physical evaluation of the thyroid, a neck ultrasonography and a radionuclide thyroid assessment as well as a complete evaluation of the thyroid function including thyroid stimulation hormone, total and free thyroid hormones, and antithyroid peroxidase antibody levels are performed based on their indication to define the functionality and nature of the nodules. The risk of malignancy (ROM) is then calculated and reported according to the American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System or the American Thyroid Association guidelines regarding the sonographic features of the nodules. When the ROM is reported high enough by the radiologist, a fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the nodule is performed to define the type of pathology.

The recommendation on whether a patient undergoes surgery or not is based on the FNA cytology report which is obtained according to the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (BSRTC). These results are categorized as follows: (I) non-diagnostic, (II) benign, (III) atypia of undetermined significance (AUS) (5–10% ROM), (IV) follicular neoplasm (20–30% ROM), (V) suspicious for malignancy (50–75% ROM), and (VI) malignant. Non-diagnostic cytology occurs in samples that are not adequate. The patients with BSRTC category V and VI, along with persistent category III and IV (indeterminate categories) nodules are referred for thyroid lobectomy or near-total thyroidectomy. Furthermore, there are some clinical features other than FNA results including large thyroid nodule, rapidly growing nodule and hyperthyroidism that can warrant thyroidectomy.

Thyroid nodules are extremely common findings with a low likelihood of harboring a clinically significant malignancy. Ultrasound is highly sensitive at identifying which nodules warrant further workup with fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy. FNA should be performed based on US findings and risk categories. The Bethesda system should be used to classify FNA results. Molecular testing may be offered if the results are likely to change the therapeutic approach. Clinicians should be keenly aware of the potential for overtreatment and should make a concerted effort to factor patient values into the decision-making process.

### Revised American Thyroid Association management guidelines for patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer [^e0ffd213]. Thyroid (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Thyroid nodules are a common clinical problem, and differentiated thyroid cancer is becoming increasingly prevalent. Since the publication of the American Thyroid Association's guidelines for the management of these disorders was published in 2006, a large amount of new information has become available, prompting a revision of the guidelines.

Methods

Relevant articles through December 2008 were reviewed by the task force and categorized by topic and level of evidence according to a modified schema used by the United States Preventative Services Task Force.

Results

The revised guidelines for the management of thyroid nodules include recommendations regarding initial evaluation, clinical and ultrasound criteria for fine-needle aspiration biopsy, interpretation of fine-needle aspiration biopsy results, and management of benign thyroid nodules. Recommendations regarding the initial management of thyroid cancer include those relating to optimal surgical management, radioiodine remnant ablation, and suppression therapy using levothyroxine. Recommendations related to long-term management of differentiated thyroid cancer include those related to surveillance for recurrent disease using ultrasound and serum thyroglobulin as well as those related to management of recurrent and metastatic disease.

Conclusions

We created evidence-based recommendations in response to our appointment as an independent task force by the American Thyroid Association to assist in the clinical management of patients with thyroid nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer. They represent, in our opinion, contemporary optimal care for patients with these disorders.

### Contemporary thyroid nodule evaluation and management [^d32dd489]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The evaluation and management of patients with thyroid nodules is no longer a 1-size-fits-all proposition. The tailored approach advocated today requires a careful assessment of each nodule to determine the likelihood that it is malignant and the chances that it will cause symptoms. Very few nodules will require an intensive workup that includes cytology and molecular testing of FNAB samples: for the vast majority, a systematic cervical US examination with assessment of clinical risk factors will provide a reliable foundation for identifying the initial management strategy. After an appropriate initial assessment, the frequency of subsequent surveillance visits for most nodules can be safely reduced compared with currently used schedules. This is particularly relevant for frail, elderly individuals, as they are unlikely to be harmed by the thyroid tumor itself, and overmedicalization can cause more harm than good. In these populations, surveillance can safely be confined to a periodic clinical examination. If surgery is needed, resections can often be less extensive. In some cases, minimally invasive, percutaneous approaches are a viable alternative to surgery. When there are multiple options, they should be discussed as frankly as possible with the patient, outlining the advantages, limitations, benefits, and risks of each. The goal is to identify the best strategy for the individual patient, in terms of disease outcomes and quality of life, avoiding the pitfalls of overdiagnosis and overtreatment. For health professionals, this means learning to work with some degree of clinical uncertainty rather than automatically resorting to intensive testing and intervention, and by weighing patients' expectations and demands.

Recommendation extraction and analysis

Two reviewers (K-WT and T-WH) independently extracted the details of the guidelines pertaining to the CPG characteristics (for example, country or region, year of dissemination, development team, and funding organization), the goals of the guidelines, the target population and audience, the recommendations related to the diagnosis of thyroid nodules, the recommendations related to the management of thyroid nodules and cancer, and the evaluation of options for postoperative follow-up. The individually recorded decisions of two reviewers were compared, and any disagreement was resolved based on the evaluation of a third reviewer (J-HL).

We constructed a table to compare the recommendations from the selected guidelines. The table was divided into the following sections and items, based on the types of clinical practices that focus on thyroid nodules and cancer: (1) diagnosis: an indication of FNA, the role of routine serum calcitonin, and an indication of a thyroid scan; (2) treatment: an indication of total thyroidectomy for DTC, and the role of cervical lymph node dissection in node-negative patients; and (3) postoperative care: an indication of I 131 ablation, and a target level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression therapy.

### Performance of a multigene classifier in thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytology… [^fa153cba]. JAMA Network (2019). Excellent credibility.

FNA indicates fine-needle aspiration; TNA, total nucleic acids; NIFTP, noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features. Predicted negative predictive value and positive predictive value with 95% CIs based on sensitivity and specificity of the multigene GC test established in this study for Bethesda III and IV cytology thyroid nodules. NIFTP indicates noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features. In this prospective, blinded, multicenter study, the multigene GC test demonstrated a high sensitivity/NPV and reasonably high specificity/PPV, which may obviate diagnostic surgery in up to 61% of patients with Bethesda III to IV indeterminate nodules, and up to 82% of all benign nodules with indeterminate cytology. Information on specific genetic alterations obtained from FNA may help inform individualized treatment of patients with a positive test result.

7 More than 600 000 thyroid FNAs are performed every year in the United States alone, and the number has been increasing annually by 16%. 8, 9 Thyroid FNA cytology can accurately classify most nodules as benign and a minority as malignant, but the results remain indeterminate in about 20% of nodules when cytological features lack specific characteristics needed for a definitive diagnosis. 10 Further, the proportion of indeterminate cytology results appears to be rising.
11. Patients eligible for this study were aged 18 years or older, had 1 or more thyroid nodules, underwent a routine FNA procedure to collect samples for cytological examination, and agreed to provide material for molecular analysis. After FNA cytology was reported, only those patients who had at least 1 nodule that yielded a cytologic diagnosis of Bethesda III, IV, or V and underwent thyroid surgery to remove 1 or more nodules were included in the study.

With a baseline disease prevalence of 28%, the test yielded an NPV of 97% and a residual cancer risk of 3% in test-negative nodules, which is similar to an average 3. 7% cancer risk in nodules diagnosed as benign by FNA cytology. 10 Although no test has perfect accuracy, it is reassuring that all false-negative cases in the study were low-stage and low-risk cancers by the American Thyroid Association criteria. 3.

### Recent experience with preoperative fine-needle aspiration biopsy of thyroid nodules in a community hospital… [^ba450f2c]. JAMA Network (2002). Excellent credibility.

Thyroid cancer was confirmed postoperatively in 70 patients. An FNA biopsy diagnosis of papillary carcinoma correlated with a predictive accuracy of 93%. Suspicious for papillary carcinoma correlated with malignancy in 8 patients. Conclusions The accuracy of an FNA biopsy of thyroid nodules in a community hospital setting is comparable to results from major endocrine referral centers. An indeterminate follicular lesion was the most common FNA biopsy indication for thyroidectomy and correlated with the presence of differentiated thyroid cancers in 18 of 60 patients. A minimally invasive procedure, FNA biopsy permits nonoperative management of most thyroid nodules, with a low risk of complications, primarily neck hematoma. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy has increased the yield of cancer in surgically treated nodules to 25% to 40%, compared with 5% to 15% before its introduction. 2, 3.

The first objective of this study was to define the diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of thyroid FNA biopsy in a community setting. This was achieved by creating a database that compared the FNA biopsy diagnosis with the final surgical pathologic diagnosis. The FNA biopsy specimens were grouped according to the following diagnoses: papillary cancer, suspicious for papillary cancer, atypical follicular cells, indeterminate follicular lesions, Hürthle cell lesion and benign, borderline, and insufficient specimens. Surgical pathologic specimens were classified as cancer, adenoma, or benign. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy is useful in the assessment and management of thyroid nodules, and its use should continue. The accuracy of an FNA biopsy of thyroid nodules in a community hospital setting compares favorably with results reported by major endocrine referral centers.

The diagnosis of papillary cancer by FNA biopsy closely correlates with the surgical outcome and enables the definitive operation to be performed without reliance on frozen section in most instances. Indeterminate follicular cytological features on FNA biopsy, the most common indication for operation in our series, necessitates thyroidectomy for diagnosis. Indeterminate follicular lesions by cytological features correlate with FVPC in 17% of patients and have an overall 30% predictability of cancer. Corresponding author: John S.

Nondiagnostic cytology — management and performance include the following: For a nodule with an initial nondiagnostic cytology result, FNA should be repeated with ultrasound (US) guidance and, if available, on-site cytologic evaluation (Strong recommendation, Moderate-quality evidence). A 3-month waiting period after a nondiagnostic biopsy is likely not necessary. Repeat FNA with US guidance will yield a diagnostic cytology specimen in 60%–80% of nodules, particularly when the cystic component is < 50%. Nondiagnostic samples constituted 2%–16% of all FNA samples, of which 7%–26% were eventually resected and malignant in 9%–32% of those resected. Of 104 nodules with two nondiagnostic cytology results, thyroid cancer was found in 25% of those with microcalcifications, irregular margins, taller than wide shape, or hypoechogenicity, but in only 4% lacking these features. Repeatedly nondiagnostic nodules without a high suspicion sonographic pattern require close observation or surgical excision for histopathologic diagnosis (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). Surgery should be considered for histopathologic diagnosis if the cytologically nondiagnostic nodule has a high suspicion sonographic pattern, growth of the nodule (> 20% in two dimensions) is detected during US surveillance, or clinical risk factors for malignancy are present (Weak recommendation, Low-quality evidence). Nondiagnostic or unsatisfactory FNA biopsies are those that fail to meet adequacy criteria, i.e., the presence of at least six groups of well-visualized follicular cells, each group containing at least 10 well-preserved epithelial cells.

### Ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy of thyroid nodules and multinodular goiters [^b18410f2]. Endocrine Practice (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe various techniques for performing ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of thyroid nodules, with the intent of shortening the learning curve for physicians with interest in this new procedure.

Methods

General principles and details of biopsy techniques and equipment are reviewed, and personal experience and preferences are described.

Results

Real-time ultrasound guidance has technically refined the FNA biopsy technique by decreasing the number of inadequate biopsy specimens and increasing both the specificity and the sensitivity of this procedure. In addition to being cost-effective, well tolerated, and expedient, ultrasound-guided FNA biopsy has emerged as the most accurate method for evaluation of thyroid nodules. The success of the procedure depends on the experience of the person using these techniques.

Conclusion

For provision of optimal evaluation and management of thyroid nodules, endocrinologists should develop expertise in ultrasound-guided FNA biopsy and understand its advantages over conventional FNA biopsy.

Fine-needle aspiration pitfalls and mitigation — misleading cytologic results: To decrease the risk of misleading cytologic results, consider the following: false-negative results are usually due to inappropriate target selection or inadequate sampling, and false-positive results are usually due to specimens with suspicious, but not diagnostic, findings; for indeterminate cytologic findings, consider a second opinion from an experienced cytopathologist. To decrease the risk of false-negative results, we recommend the following: routine use of FNA; aspiration of at least 2 sites within the nodule; for multiple nodules, prioritize nodules to be sampled according to US findings; for cystic lesions, sample solid or vascularized areas with FNA and submit cyst fluid for cytologic examination; review the slides with an experienced cytopathologist; follow-up benign nodule(s) with US in 12 to 24 months; repeat FNA in benign nodules with suspicious clinical or US findings; and in large-sized thyroid lesions, sample peripheral and, if possible, solid areas to avoid fluid or necrotic zones.

### How to interpret thyroid fine-needle aspiration biopsy reports: a guide for the busy radiologist in the era of the bethesda classification system [^8c8e30dc]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is the current primary test to risk stratify thyroid nodules. However, in up to one third of biopsies, cytology is indeterminate. The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology categorizes thyroid cytology findings into six groups, with each group assigned a putative malignancy risk. This article reviews the Bethesda System, emphasizing the key facts necessary to understand thyroid biopsy results and effectively manage patients after FNAB.

Conclusion

It is important to diagnose and stratify the risk of malignancy in thyroid nodules. A working knowledge of the Bethesda System permits accurate, evidence-based risk stratification of patients with thyroid nodules and thereby facilitates their management. Because it is a uniform diagnostic approach, the Bethesda System allows comparisons of different management strategies across different institutions.

### Cost impact of molecular testing for indeterminate thyroid nodule fine-needle aspiration biopsies [^c75b8bd2]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Thyroid nodules are a frequently encountered clinical problem. With the routine use of high-resolution ultrasound, the detection of thyroid nodules has increased, and the incidence of thyroid nodules in adults is now 20–75%. Approximately 5% of nodules are malignant, and evaluation to exclude thyroid cancer is important, especially because the incidence is rising and thyroid cancer is now the fifth most common cancer diagnosed in women. Systematic and accurate algorithms to evaluate thyroid nodules are therefore becoming increasingly relevant. Commonly used evidence-based guidelines have been developed through the American Thyroid Association (ATA) and American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE). Neck ultrasound is the best initial diagnostic imaging modality for thyroid nodule characterization, and modern algorithms rely on fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology results to guide subsequent management.

FNA is highly sensitive for thyroid cancer, but specificity is low. Cytology results are considered indeterminate in 20–30% of cases and include results in the follicular lesion of undetermined significance (FLUS), follicular or Hürthle cell neoplasm (FN), or suspicious for malignancy (SUSP) categories. The risk of cancer in these indeterminate FNA categories can range widely, from 5–75% thus diagnostic thyroidectomy is often necessary. In the absence of clinical risk factors for thyroid malignancy, an initial thyroid lobectomy is a common surgical option for patients with a solitary thyroid nodule and FNA results in the cytology categories considered low-risk for malignancy (FN or repeatedly FLUS); however, those patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer after lobectomy often require a second operation for completion thyroidectomy, which incurs additional costs and risks. Improving preoperative risk stratification to better discriminate which thyroid nodules are malignant will facilitate initial definitive surgery and could reduce the costs of care.

What to do with indeterminate results?

As noted, the term "indeterminate cytology" refers to Bethesda class III or class IV findings, which are associated with expected malignancy rates of 10% to 30% and 25% to 40%, respectively. The options suggested for identifying these nodules includes repeat FNAB for cytology and/or molecular testing and diagnostic lobectomy. Some data suggest that a repeat US risk stratification can be useful in predicting malignancy and in planning further steps for the management of indeterminate nodules, or at least those in Bethesda class III. However, if nodules are properly selected beforehand, and the pretest risk of malignancy is high, the utility of this approach may be reduced.

Cytological assessment of a second fine needle aspirate is commonly used, but it provides a definitive diagnosis for only 40% of class I (nondiagnostic) and III nodules. If the second cytological study is still indeterminate, diagnostic surgery (usually lobectomy) has traditionally been the only route to a definitive pathological diagnosis. It is obviously expensive and associated with some risks. And if the nodule proves to be malignant, reoperation (completion thyroidectomy) is often indicated, with added risks and costs. Up to 60% of patients undergoing lobectomy for an indeterminate nodule are likely to be over- or undertreated at initial surgery.

Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cytology — Bethesda categories, review standards, and malignancy risks: Cytologic examination of an FNA specimen is typically categorized as: category I: nondiagnostic; category II: benign; category III: atypia of undetermined significance (AUS); category IV: follicular neoplasm or oncocytic neoplasm; category V: suspicious for malignancy; or category VI: malignancy (includes papillary, medullary, anaplastic, or lymphoma), and these diagnostic categories reflect the 2023 Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology; the NCCN Guidelines for Thyroid Carcinoma no longer provide management recommendations for nodules classified as Bethesda I and Bethesda II; pathology and cytopathology slides should be reviewed at the treating institution by a pathologist with expertise in the diagnosis of thyroid disorders; although FNA is a very sensitive test — particularly for papillary carcinoma — false-negative results are sometimes obtained, so a reassuring FNA should not override worrisome clinical or radiographic findings; estimated mean risk of malignancy, inclusive of NIFTP, is 22% (range, 13%–30%) for Bethesda III, 30% (range 23%–34%) for Bethesda IV, 74% (range 67%–83%) for Bethesda V, and 97% (range 97%–100%) for Bethesda VI, and if excluding NIFTP, estimated mean risk of malignancy for Bethesda III, IV, V, and VI decrease to 16%, 23%, 65%, and 94%, respectively.

Objective

Fine needle aspiration (FNA) of thyroid nodules is the gold standard screening test for thyroid malignancy. Unfortunately, FNA may produce insufficient material for diagnosis. If nodules requiring FNA with a higher risk for nondiagnostic (ND) cytology could be identified pre-procedure, this might allow better patient guidance and potentially facilitate an altered approach to FNA.

Methods

The literature investigating risk factors for ND cytology was reviewed, including studies of patient factors, sonographic or nodule factors, and procedural factors. Twenty-five studies that included assessment of at least two potential factors in ND outcomes for initial FNA were identified. Individual factors were evaluated in terms of the general consensus of studies reporting either a positive significant association with ND cytology or no association.

Results

Most patient and nodule factors lack consensus as far as their association with ND cytology across these studies. Factors where there are some consensuses include practitioner experience, depth of nodule, and cystic content; however, hypervascularity of the nodule does not appear to have a consensus.

Conclusion

A number of study design improvements suggested by this review could realistically be incorporated into higher powered future studies. Novel factors such as tissue composition anterior to the nodule or the age of the patient could also be investigated in future work. Operator experience is the most convincing procedural factor, and approaches to future studies of the FNA technique itself are proposed. That said, the factors with consensus among studies can be seen leading candidates for this future research, and the published studies illuminate a number of as yet unexplored factors that could in many cases be studied retrospectively.
