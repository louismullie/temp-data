## Question

A 52-year-old woman presents with a 3-month history of progressive shortness of breath and dry cough. She works as a bird breeder and reports increased symptoms when cleaning bird cages. On examination, she has inspiratory crackles at both lung bases. High-resolution CT of the chest shows ground-glass opacities and mosaic attenuation, but no definite honeycombing. The multidisciplinary team is considering a diagnosis of interstitial lung disease, with hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) high on the differential. The team is debating the next diagnostic step.

According to the ATS guideline, what is the recommended role of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) with lymphocyte cellular analysis in this patient, and how does the recommendation differ if the suspected HP is non-fibrotic versus fibrotic?

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) with lymphocyte cellular analysis in suspected hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), and how the recommendation differs between non-fibrotic and fibrotic phenotypes. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical scenario and pretest probability. Then, I should verify the guideline stance for non-fibrotic HP. Next, I will examine the guideline stance for fibrotic HP. After that, I need to check the diagnostic performance and thresholds for BAL lymphocytosis. Finally, I will integrate this into a practical, stepwise recommendation and address nuances and exceptions, including when BAL may reasonably be deferred.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and pretest probability. The patient is a 52-year-old woman with progressive dyspnea and dry cough, bibasilar crackles, a compelling exposure to avian antigens, and HRCT showing ground-glass opacities and mosaic attenuation without honeycombing, which together raise a high pretest probability of HP, particularly non-fibrotic disease given the absence of overt fibrosis on imaging, although I should be cautious not to overcall fibrosis without careful radiology review [^3d70ab04] [^94392bcd].

> Now, I should verify the ATS/ALAT/JRS position for non-fibrotic HP. The guideline issues a strong recommendation to obtain BAL with lymphocyte cellular analysis in patients with newly identified ILD when non-fibrotic HP is in the differential, largely because BAL helps distinguish HP from mimics like sarcoidosis and can exclude infection, which is especially important in non-fibrotic presentations and in endemic settings for tuberculosis, even though the confidence in the estimated effects is rated as very low due to limited-quality evidence [^a13d7505] [^1e384a64] [^c8e0380b].

> Wait, let me verify the rationale and practical implications for non-fibrotic HP. BAL lymphocytosis supports HP and, when combined with a compatible exposure and typical HRCT features, can yield a high-confidence diagnosis without further invasive testing. The committee also notes that a lymphocyte threshold around 30% is reasonable in the absence of a validated cutoff, recognizing that healthy nonsmokers often have 10–15% lymphocytes and that higher thresholds trade sensitivity for specificity, which I should keep in mind when interpreting results [^aa3bde65] [^c8e0380b] [^6b3c4b1a].

> Next, I should review the ATS/ALAT/JRS position for fibrotic HP. Here, the guideline issues a weak suggestion, rather than a strong recommendation, to obtain BAL with lymphocyte cellular analysis, reflecting lower diagnostic yield in fibrotic disease and the fact that lymphocytosis is less consistent and often milder, so BAL may not change post-test probability as much when exposure and imaging are already compelling [^a13d7505] [^94392bcd].

> Hold on, I should verify the diagnostic performance in fibrotic HP to avoid overinterpreting BAL. Meta-analytic data show that BAL lymphocytosis can help separate HP from IPF and sarcoidosis, but the area under the curve is modest, and thresholds of 20%, 30%, and 40% yield progressively higher specificity at the cost of sensitivity. Importantly, fibrotic HP often shows lower BAL lymphocyte counts than non-fibrotic HP, and a substantial fraction of fibrotic HP cases have less than 10% lymphocytes, so a normal BAL does not exclude HP in this phenotype [^6b3c4b1a] [^09418552] [^ea6c9f02].

> I need to ensure I integrate the exposure and imaging context. When exposure is identified and HRCT is typical for HP, some guidelines suggest that routine BAL may not be necessary because it rarely alters post-test probability; however, this is a weak recommendation and applies mainly to high pretest probability scenarios, whereas in intermediate probability or when the exposure history is uncertain, BAL can still meaningfully inform the differential and guide next steps, so I should tailor the decision to the individual case and local practice patterns [^86d963cc] [^918d4315] [^1ec481d8].

> Let me consider the practical, stepwise approach for this patient. Given the strong exposure history, bibasilar crackles, and HRCT showing ground-glass and mosaic attenuation without honeycombing, non-fibrotic HP is most likely, so I would recommend proceeding with BAL with lymphocyte cellular analysis, while also sending samples for infection studies, and then integrating BAL results with exposure and HRCT in a multidisciplinary discussion to assign diagnostic confidence and decide whether additional testing such as transbronchial biopsy or cryobiopsy is needed [^a13d7505] [^8525cbf3] [^aa3bde65].

> But wait, what if the HRCT had shown a UIP pattern with honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis? In that fibrotic scenario, I should confirm that BAL remains a suggestion rather than a mandate, and I would interpret lymphocytosis cautiously because it is less sensitive and less specific in fibrotic HP. In such cases, BAL can still help exclude alternatives like eosinophilic pneumonia or infection, and a high lymphocyte count may increase confidence, but I should not rely on BAL alone to confirm fibrotic HP and should be prepared to escalate to cryobiopsy or surgical lung biopsy if the diagnosis remains uncertain after MDD [^a13d7505] [^6b3c4b1a] [^5bffaa48].

> I should double-check the bottom line to ensure internal consistency. For non-fibrotic HP, BAL with lymphocyte analysis is strongly recommended to support diagnosis and exclude infection. For fibrotic HP, BAL is suggested but with lower diagnostic yield, so it should be individualized based on pretest probability, imaging pattern, and the need to exclude alternatives, with results interpreted in MDD to guide whether biopsy is warranted [^a13d7505] [^94392bcd] [^aa3bde65].

---

Per ATS/ALAT/JRS guidance, **BAL with lymphocyte analysis is recommended** in suspected nonfibrotic HP to support diagnosis and exclude infection, with a practical lymphocyte threshold of ≥ 30% supporting HP [^a13d7505] [^c8e0380b]. In suspected fibrotic HP, **BAL is suggested** to help distinguish HP from IPF or sarcoidosis, but lymphocytosis is less sensitive and specific, so results must be integrated with exposure and imaging in MDD [^a13d7505] [^6b3c4b1a]. BAL is not routinely indicated when exposure and HRCT are typical for HP, as it rarely changes management [^86d963cc] [^918d4315].

## ATS/ALAT/JRS recommendations for BAL in HP

The ATS/ALAT/JRS guideline provides **phenotype-specific recommendations** for BAL in HP:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommendation for bal with lymphocyte analysis** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|-|
| Nonfibrotic HP | Strong recommendation (very low confidence) | - Supports diagnosis <br/> - Excludes infection (e.g. TB) <br/> - Lymphocyte threshold ≥ 30% supports HP [^a13d7505] [^c8e0380b] |
| Fibrotic HP | Suggestion (very low confidence) | - Helps distinguish HP from IPF/sarcoidosis <br/> - Lower sensitivity/specificity <br/> - Results need MDD integration [^a13d7505] [^6b3c4b1a] |

---

## Diagnostic utility of BAL lymphocyte analysis

BAL lymphocytosis is a hallmark of HP, but its diagnostic performance varies by phenotype:

- **Nonfibrotic HP**: Higher lymphocyte counts are common; a threshold of ≥ 30% is reasonable to support HP, though no definitive cutoff exists [^c8e0380b] [^6b3c4b1a].
- **Fibrotic HP**: Lymphocytosis is less frequent and lower; thresholds of 20–40% have modest sensitivity/specificity, so results must be interpreted in clinical and radiographic context [^6b3c4b1a] [^09418552].

---

## Limitations and considerations

- **Variability**: BAL lymphocyte counts vary with exposure, timing, and phenotype, limiting standalone diagnostic value [^6b3c4b1a] [^94392bcd].
- **Integration**: BAL results must be integrated with exposure history, HRCT, and MDD to establish diagnostic confidence [^aa3bde65] [^e025d051].
- **Infection**: BAL is valuable to exclude infection, especially in nonfibrotic HP or immunocompromised patients [^a13d7505] [^c8e0380b].

---

## Clinical scenarios where BAL may not be necessary

BAL may be omitted when:

- **High probability**: Compelling exposure and typical HRCT make HP likely, and BAL is unlikely to change management [^86d963cc] [^918d4315].
- **Risk**: High procedural risk or severe disease may outweigh benefit [^64fdbddd].
- **Patient preference**: Patients may decline after shared decision-making [^aa3bde65].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Nonfibrotic HP**: Strongly recommend BAL with lymphocyte analysis; ≥ 30% lymphocytes supports HP [^a13d7505] [^c8e0380b].
- **Fibrotic HP**: Suggest BAL to help differentiate HP from IPF/sarcoidosis, but interpret cautiously and integrate with MDD [^a13d7505] [^6b3c4b1a].
- **High probability**: Omit BAL when exposure and HRCT are typical, unless results would alter management [^86d963cc] [^918d4315].

---

BAL with lymphocyte analysis is a **valuable tool** in HP, especially for nonfibrotic disease, but results must be interpreted in clinical, radiographic, and multidisciplinary context.

Committee discussion

The large MD identified when the proportion of BAL fluid lymphocytes among patients with HP was compared with the proportion of BAL fluid lymphocytes among patients with IPF or sarcoidosis led most of the guideline committee to conclude that BAL fluid cellular lymphocyte analysis can play a key role in distinguishing fibrotic HP from IPF and sarcoidosis and in distinguishing nonfibrotic HP from sarcoidosis. The committee was unwilling to extrapolate the results to other ILDs, given the paucity of data, and identified such comparisons as a key research priority.

The committee did not identify a threshold proportion of BAL fluid lymphocytes that distinguishes HP from non-HP ILD, given the poor area under the curve for each comparison. The seeming discordance of the MD and the area under the curve was attributed to the large standard deviation of many studies. In the absence of empirical evidence, the committee's collective clinical experience indicated that healthy nonsmokers have a proportion of BAL fluid lymphocytes of 10–15% and, therefore, the committee considered a 30% threshold to be reasonable.

Although the guideline committee concluded that BAL fluid cellular lymphocyte analysis is indicated to increase the diagnostic likelihood of HP, the committee made a stronger recommendation for BAL in patients with suspected nonfibrotic HP than for patients with suspected fibrotic HP because there is an additional reason for BAL in patients with suspected nonfibrotic HP — to identify or exclude pulmonary infection, especially M. tuberculosis in patients from endemic areas with a high prevalence of M. tuberculosis, which can progress to death if untreated.

Background: This guideline addresses the diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP). It represents a collaborative effort among the American Thoracic Society, Japanese Respiratory Society, and Asociación Latinoamericana del Tórax. Methods: Systematic reviews were performed for six questions. The evidence was discussed, and then recommendations were formulated by a multidisciplinary committee of experts in the field of interstitial lung disease and HP using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Results: The guideline committee defined HP, and clinical, radiographic, and pathological features were described. HP was classified into nonfibrotic and fibrotic phenotypes. There was limited evidence that was directly applicable to all questions. The need for a thorough history and a validated questionnaire to identify potential exposures was agreed on. Serum IgG testing against potential antigens associated with HP was suggested to identify potential exposures. For patients with nonfibrotic HP, a recommendation was made in favor of obtaining bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid for lymphocyte cellular analysis, and suggestions for transbronchial lung biopsy and surgical lung biopsy were also made. For patients with fibrotic HP, suggestions were made in favor of obtaining BAL for lymphocyte cellular analysis, transbronchial lung cryobiopsy, and surgical lung biopsy. Diagnostic criteria were established, and a diagnostic algorithm was created by expert consensus. Knowledge gaps were identified as future research directions. Conclusions: The guideline committee developed a systematic approach to the diagnosis of HP. The approach should be reevaluated as new evidence accumulates.

Although the diagnosis of HP is predominantly based on exposure identification, chest HRCT scan pattern, and bronchoscopic/histopathological findings, a major challenge is that no individual feature is sufficient in isolation, nor are any mandatory. This results in the potential for multiple combinations of abnormalities that can result in a diagnosis of HP. Although a single diagnostic algorithm may be applied to both fibrotic and nonfibrotic HP, these populations have frequent differences in their underlying features. For example, patients with nonfibrotic HP more often have an acute and identifiable exposure, rapid onset of both pulmonary and systemic symptoms, presence of centrilobular nodularity on chest CT scans, and lymphocytosis on BAL cellular analysis (,–). Conversely, patients with fibrotic HP are less likely to have an identified exposure and more frequently have an insidious and chronic onset of isolated pulmonary symptoms, fibrotic changes with or without more specific features of HP on chest imaging, and a nonspecific differential cell profile on BAL analysis (,–). Additional features may be useful in the context of an MDD to increase or decrease the diagnostic confidence of HP on a case-by-case basis, but these are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to justify inclusion in formal diagnostic criteria.

There is often substantial uncertainty in the diagnosis of HP. This occurs most frequently in the distinction between fibrotic HP and IPF, reflecting the overlapping features and lack of a single, definitive gold-standard test for both diagnoses. The diagnostic criteria for HP provided in this guideline emphasize the importance of three primary domains: 1) exposure identification (e.g. clinical history with or without a questionnaire, serum IgG testing against potential antigens associated with HP, and/or specific inhalational challenge), 2) imaging pattern, and 3) BAL lymphocytosis/histopathological findings, with each described in detail in the corresponding sections of this document. Although the specific features that satisfy each domain are different for fibrotic and nonfibrotic HP, a single approach is used for all patients who have a clinical presentation consistent with HP.

How to Use These Guidelines

There are many similarities in the initial presentation of patients with fibrotic ILD. This similarity lends itself to the question, "When should clinicians use these guidelines and when should they use the 2018 ATS/European Respiratory Society (ERS)/JRS/ALAT guidelines on the diagnosis of IPF ?" because both guidelines address patients with newly identified fibrotic ILD.

Most patients with fibrotic ILD present with an insidious onset of cough, exertional dyspnea, and bibasilar crackles with radiological evidence of fibrosis in lower lobes. Both CPGs are applicable to such patients. Additional history is the first step in evaluating such patients and is essential to deciding which guideline to follow. If the patient has a potential culprit exposure, this CPG should be followed, which means that the initial steps include a high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan and BAL fluid lymphocyte cellular analysis, followed by a multidisciplinary discussion (MDD). If the patient has no culprit exposures and is a male former smoker > 60 years old, the 2018 ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT guidelines on the diagnosis of IPF should be followed, which means that the initial steps include an HRCT scan followed by an MDD. For all other patients with newly identified fibrotic ILD, the decision of which CPG to initially follow should be made on a case-by-case basis. Regardless of which CPG is followed, the initial steps are similar, and ongoing diagnostic evaluation may be redirected on the basis of the MDD.

It should be emphasized that clinicians should apply the recommendations within this CPG in the clinical context of each individual patient, considering the patient's values and preferences, and should not consider any recommendations as mandates. No CPG or recommendation can consider all potential clinical circumstances.

Summary of Recommendations

1 Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) must be considered in the differential diagnosis for patients with newly identified interstitial lung disease (ILD).
2 The guideline committee categorized HP into two clinical phenotypes — nonfibrotic and fibrotic HP — and made separate recommendations for each: a. For patients with clinical and radiographic manifestations suggestive of nonfibrotic HP (i.e. patients without radiological and/or histopathological evidence of fibrosis), the guideline committee:

i. makes no recommendation or suggestion for or against the use of a questionnaire to identify potential HP inciting agents and sources; instead, the guideline committee recommends development and validation of a questionnaire. Remark: Pending the availability of a validated questionnaire, the guideline committee advocates that clinicians take a thorough history to identify potential exposures and sources in the patient's environment that are known to be associated with HP.
ii. suggests performing serum IgG testing that targets potential antigens associated with HP (suggestion, very low confidence in the estimated effects).
iii. recommends obtaining bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid for lymphocyte cellular analysis (recommendation, very low confidence in the estimated effects).
iv. suggests transbronchial forceps lung biopsy (suggestion, very low confidence in the estimated effects).
v. makes no recommendation or suggestion for or against transbronchial lung cryobiopsy.
vi. suggests surgical lung biopsy only when all other diagnostic testing has not yielded a diagnosis (suggestion, very low confidence in the estimated effects). b. For patients with clinical and radiographic manifestations suggestive of fibrotic HP (i.e. patients with radiological and/or histopathological evidence of fibrosis), the guideline committee: i. makes no recommendation or suggestion for or against the use of a questionnaire to identify potential HP inciting agents and sources; instead, the guideline committee recommends development and validation of a questionnaire. Remark: Pending the availability of a validated questionnaire, the guideline committee advocates that clinicians take a thorough history to identify potential exposures and sources in the patient's environment that are known to be associated with HP. ii. suggests performing serum IgG testing that targets potential antigens associated with HP (suggestion, very low confidence in the estimated effects). iii. suggests obtaining BAL fluid for lymphocyte cellular analysis (suggestion, very low confidence in the estimated effects). iv. makes no recommendation or suggestion for or against transbronchial forceps lung biopsy. v. suggests transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (suggestion, very low confidence in the estimated effects). vi. suggests surgical lung biopsy; this recommendation is intended to apply when all other diagnostic testing has not yielded a diagnosis (suggestion, very low confidence in the estimated effects).

Conclusions

When a patient presents with newly detected ILD identified by HRCT, the clinician should be prompted to elicit a careful and thorough history and possibly utilize formal questionnaires to reveal the possibility of a temporal relationship between environmental factors/exposures and the onset of symptoms. Serum IgG antibody testing against potential antigens associated with HP may also be performed to detect exposure to potential inciting agents of HP. Many patients should proceed to BAL with lymphocyte cellular analysis with or without transbronchial lung biopsy, and if this information, accompanied by the HRCT patterns, is insufficient to make a definitive diagnosis, they should undergo an MDD with consideration of TBBx, TBLC, or SLB. This approach is recommended by experts in HP on the basis of the best available evidence. The approach should be reevaluated as new evidence becomes available and should be modified as needed.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^86d963cc]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) diagnosis — bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL): For patients with suspected HP who have a compelling exposure history within the appropriate clinical context and a chest HRCT pattern typical for HP, we suggest not routinely using BAL fluid analysis to confirm a diagnosis of HP (Weak Recommendation, Very Low-Quality Evidence). BAL fluid analysis can narrow the differential diagnosis by excluding competing causes, particularly in nonfibrotic HP (eg, infection), but in patients with a high pretest probability of HP, the BAL cellular differential generally does not significantly alter the post-test probability and as a result adds little additional diagnostic information. In the appropriate clinical context, a history of clinically relevant exposure to a compelling IA with a typical high-resolution CT pattern allows for a confident diagnosis of HP. Lymphocytic alveolitis is not consistently present in patients with fibrotic HP, and BAL fluid lymphocytosis is not sufficiently sensitive or specific to rule in or rule out the diagnosis of fibrotic HP; however, BAL fluid lymphocytosis may increase diagnostic confidence when the IA is identified and HRCT findings are compatible with HP and should be considered when the exposure history and imaging data are discordant, and may exclude common alternative diagnoses, such as IPF, when the lymphocyte differential count is high (eg, ≥ 40%).

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) lymphocyte cellular analysis — newly identified interstitial lung disease (ILD) with suspected hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP): For patients with newly identified ILD whose differential diagnosis includes nonfibrotic HP, the guideline committee recommends BAL with lymphocyte cellular analysis (recommendation, very low confidence in the estimated effects). For patients with newly identified ILD whose differential diagnosis includes fibrotic HP, the guideline committee suggests BAL with lymphocyte cellular analysis (suggestion, very low confidence in the estimated effects). The committee noted an added rationale in suspected nonfibrotic HP to identify or exclude pulmonary infection, especially M. tuberculosis in patients from endemic areas with a high prevalence of M. tuberculosis, which can progress to death if untreated.

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) lymphocytosis — diagnostic evidence and thresholds in adults with suspected hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) are summarized as follows: Question 3 asks whether patients with newly detected interstitial lung disease (ILD) should undergo BAL fluid lymphocyte cellular analysis to diagnose HP. Most studies enrolled patients with known HP or other ILDs and compared BAL lymphocyte percentages across conditions. A meta-analysis of 36 studies (1,643 patients) showed higher BAL lymphocyte proportions in HP than idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) with mean difference [MD], 30% (95% CI, 22–34%), with subgroup MDs of 34% (95% CI, 29–40%) for nonfibrotic HP, 21% (95% CI, 14–27%) for fibrotic HP, and 36% (95% CI, 32–40%) for mixed populations. A meta-analysis of 53 studies (3,112 patients) showed higher BAL lymphocyte proportions in HP than sarcoidosis (MD, 19%; 95% CI, 17–21%). For distinguishing fibrotic HP from IPF, BAL lymphocyte thresholds of 20%, 30%, and 40% yielded sensitivities of 69%, 59%, and 41% and specificities of 61%, 80%, and 93%, respectively, with an area under the curve of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.51–0.58). For distinguishing fibrotic HP from sarcoidosis, thresholds of 20%, 30%, and 40% yielded sensitivities of 69%, 59%, and 41% and specificities of 26%, 43%, and 61%, respectively, with an area under the curve of 0.44 (95% CI, 0.41–0.47).

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) diagnostic criteria — multidisciplinary discussion and phenotype-specific patterns: The diagnosis of HP requires integration of multiple domains that are ideally considered in the context of a multidisciplinary discussion (MDD), and fibrotic HP should be considered in the differential diagnosis for all patients with a fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD), with an identifiable exposure absent in up to 50% of patients with fibrotic HP. No individual feature is sufficient in isolation, nor are any mandatory, and although a single diagnostic algorithm may be applied to both fibrotic and nonfibrotic HP, these populations have frequent differences in their underlying features; nonfibrotic HP more often has an acute and identifiable exposure, rapid onset of both pulmonary and systemic symptoms, centrilobular nodularity on chest computed tomography (CT) scans, and lymphocytosis on bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cellular analysis, whereas fibrotic HP is less likely to have an identified exposure and more frequently has an insidious and chronic onset of isolated pulmonary symptoms, fibrotic changes on chest imaging, and a nonspecific differential cell profile on BAL analysis.

Additional guidance — diagnostic approach and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) use in hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) emphasizes probabilistic reasoning and selective BAL. The guidance in this analysis stresses probabilistic reasoning during the stepwise diagnostic process. The guideline committee does not recommend BAL with lymphocyte cellular analysis in all subjects, particularly in those with a compelling exposure history within the appropriate clinical context and a chest HRCT pattern typical for HP (eg, BHP). In high prevalence settings, such as nonfibrotic HP, such a combination may be sufficiently predictive of histopathological HP to forgo BAL (or lung biopsy), and BAL fluid analysis should be considered to evaluate for an additional reason according to the pretest estimate and/or if the pretest probability of HP is in the middle, above the test threshold and below the treatment threshold.

### Bronchoalveolar lavage lymphocytosis in hypersensitivity pneumonitis: a retrospective cohort analysis with elimination of incorporation bias [^4e1b9885]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is an immune-mediated interstitial lung disease characterized by inhalational antigen exposure leading to a type IV hypersensitivity response and subsequent parenchymal lung injury. Bronchoalveolar lavage lymphocytosis (BALL) has been recently proposed to support HP diagnosis. A recent diagnostic guideline from the ATS/JRS/ALAT recommends the use of BALL with a lymphocyte count of greater than or equal to 30% as increasing diagnostic confidence. Evidence for this recommendation references prior studies demonstrating comparatively higher BAL lymphocyte counts in HP compared to other interstitial lung disease (ILD). Two recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses report higher BALL in HP though pooled findings suggested less predictive characteristics. The authors highlight several important limitations including the aggregation of older studies with varied diagnostic criteria and incorporation bias, where BALL itself may have been used to make initial diagnoses for study inclusion.

Prognostic significance has also been reported for BALL findings in HP. Higher counts have been associated with improved survival and better response to treatment. However, such findings remain unclear in patients with fibrosis as prior clinical categorizations based on suspected duration of symptoms or antigen exposure (categorized as 'acute', 'subacute', and 'chronic') did not specifically distinguish between fibrotic or non-fibrotic presentations. It is known that fibrosis is associated with greater mortality in HP at the same time also associated with lower BALL counts compared to non-fibrotic patients.

The primary aim of our study was to determine the extent and frequency of BALL findings in patients with non-fibrotic and fibrotic HP diagnosed according to recent international guidance, without the inclusion of BALL as a diagnostic criterion. Secondary objectives included evaluating the association of BALL findings with survival as well as assessing clinical correlates of diagnostic BALL findings in those with fibrotic HP, where clinical diagnosis is often more challenging given overlap with other fibrotic ILD and potential increased theoretical risk with invasive studies due to more clinically severe or advanced disease.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis — bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cellular analysis recommendation: For patients with suspected HP who have a compelling exposure history within the appropriate clinical context and a chest HRCT pattern typical for HP, we suggest not routinely using BAL fluid analysis to confirm a diagnosis of HP (Weak Recommendation, Very Low-Quality Evidence). Voting results were: definitely agree, 10; probably agree, 3; neutral (no recommendation for or against), 1; probably disagree, 0; definitely disagree, 1; abstained from voting, 0. Remarks note that BAL fluid analysis can narrow the differential by excluding competing causes, particularly in nonfibrotic HP, but in patients with a high pretest probability of HP the BAL cellular differential generally does not significantly alter the post-test probability and adds little diagnostic information; lymphocytic alveolitis is not consistently present in fibrotic HP and BAL lymphocytosis is not sufficiently sensitive or specific to rule in or rule out fibrotic HP, although it may increase confidence when the IA is identified and HRCT is compatible, should be considered when exposure history and imaging are discordant, and may exclude alternatives such as IPF when the lymphocyte differential count is high (eg, ≥ 40%).

Panel discussion and contextual use of BAL lymphocytosis in hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP): Evidence of the diagnostic utility of BAL fluid analysis in HP from observational studies is of very low quality, and due to bias and absent diagnostic accuracy measures, meta-analysis of its discriminative ability in fibrotic disease was not possible; nevertheless, the literature suggests that the diagnostic accuracy lies in the positive predictive value of lymphocytosis, and BAL analysis may be appropriate in subjects with a multidisciplinary discussion (MDD) consensus working diagnosis of fibrotic HP, with a high BAL lymphocyte count potentially adjusting the MDD probability enough to alter management or prompt video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) or transbronchial cryobiopsy (TBC), while acknowledging no studies combine BAL with pretest MDD probability and that diagnostic value is tethered to clinical and radiological integration; despite very low confidence in diagnostic yield, the recommendation places a high value on establishing HP diagnosis in a stepwise approach.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^85b91553]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Algorithm for the diagnosis of fibrotic and nonfibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) integrates clinical context with inciting antigen exposure status, chest imaging by high-resolution CT (HRCT), bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and lung histology within multidisciplinary discussion (MDD), and the diagnostic confidences are described as a conceptual model rather than quantitative probabilities. BAL is shown if appropriate and does not imply that every suspected HP case must undergo BAL; moreover, BAL lymphocytosis (e.g., ≥ 20%) alone would not rule in HP and cutoffs to distinguish HP remain to be determined. Until further evidence becomes available, transbronchial biopsies may be considered, and according to clinical context and MDD diagnostic confidence the diagnosis can be provisional or ultimately HP, with the possibility during serial evaluations that it may change to not HP. When the inciting antigen exposure is indeterminate or unidentified, alternative nonfibrotic causes commonly not captured by history, including primary bronchiolar disorders, should be considered.

### Diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis in adults. An official ATS / JRS / ALAT clinical practice guideline [^aa3bde65]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) diagnostic confidence and evaluation — interstitial lung disease (ILD) diagnoses are categorized as definite (≥ 90% confidence), high-confidence (80–89%), moderate-confidence (70–79%), and low-confidence (51–69%). HP can be diagnosed with high confidence in patients in whom an exposure has been identified and who have a typical HP pattern at HRCT and have bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) lymphocytosis; such patients do not require additional testing. Patients with any other combination of exposure history, HRCT pattern, and BAL results should undergo a multidisciplinary discussion (MDD) that includes an experienced expert in ILD (pulmonologist), a chest radiologist, and, if transbronchial lung biopsies were performed at the time of BAL, a pathologist familiar with histopathological features of interstitial pneumonias and HP. Additional histopathological sampling should be considered after the MDD in some patients with a high-confidence diagnosis, moderate-confidence diagnosis, or low-confidence diagnosis or in patients for whom an alternative diagnosis has not been established. A low-confidence diagnosis may be adequate in patients for whom the differential diagnosis has been sufficiently narrowed such that further investigations are unlikely to alter management, when invasive testing has unacceptable risks, or when such tests are declined by the patient. The diagnosis should be reconsidered at subsequent visits, particularly for patients without a definite diagnosis.

Figure 7 — diagnostic evaluation of suspected hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) in adults outlines that a patient with newly detected interstitial lung abnormalities on chest imaging undergoes exposure assessment and chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), followed by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) with lymphocyte cellular analysis with or without transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB); if exposure identified AND typical HP pattern on HRCT AND BAL lymphocytosis, this leads to high-confidence diagnosis of HP, whereas another pathway proceeds to consider transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (TBLC) or surgical lung biopsy (SLB) and then to diagnosis of HP per Figure 6. High-resolution computed tomography should be performed using the technique described in Table 3 and then reviewed with a thoracic radiologist. Transbronchial lung biopsy is suggested for patients with potential nonfibrotic HP; TBLC is suggested for patients with potential nonfibrotic HP, depending on local expertise; and SLB is infrequently considered in patients with nonfibrotic HP. A provisional diagnosis may be adequate in patients for whom the differential diagnosis has been sufficiently narrowed such that further investigations are unlikely to alter management, when invasive testing has unacceptable risks, or when such tests are declined by the patient.

Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) lymphocyte thresholds — nonfibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) versus sarcoidosis: BAL fluid lymphocyte thresholds of 20%, 30%, and 40% yielded sensitivities of 95%, 88%, and 76%, respectively, and specificities of 26%, 43%, and 61% respectively, with an area under the curve of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.67–0.74). A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess potential inclusion bias; the results remained the same, and the studies were therefore kept in the final analysis. The large MD identified when the proportion of BAL fluid lymphocytes among patients with HP was compared with the proportion of BAL fluid lymphocytes among patients with IPF or sarcoidosis led most of the guideline committee to conclude that BAL fluid cellular lymphocyte analysis can play a key role in distinguishing fibrotic HP from IPF and sarcoidosis and in distinguishing nonfibrotic HP from sarcoidosis.

### Chronic cough: evaluation and management… [^fef91b31]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

4 in recognition of the fact that multiple etiologies, including chronic rhinosinusitis, allergic rhinitis, and nonallergic rhinitis, were difficult to differentiate solely by clinical presentation. UACS is the most common cause of chronic cough. 10 Rhinorrhea, nasal stuffiness, sneezing, itching, and postnasal drainage suggest the diagnosis, but their absence does not rule out UACS. 11 Physical findings may include swollen turbinates and direct visualization of postnasal drainage and cobblestoning of the posterior pharynx. If a specific cause is identified, therapy should be started; otherwise, initial treatment includes a decongestant combined with a first-generation antihistamine. Intranasal corticosteroids, saline nasal rinses, nasal anticholinergics, and antihistamines are also reasonable options. 10 Clinical improvement should occur within days to weeks, and up to two months.

If chronic rhinosinusitis is suspected, sinus computed tomography or flexible nasolaryngoscopy should be performed. Sinus radiography is not recommended because of limited sensitivity.
12. 13 It should be suspected in patients with shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest tightness, but cough can be the only manifestation in cough variant asthma. If the physical examination and spirometry findings are nondiagnostic, bronchial challenge testing should be considered. 14 Resolution of the cough after asthma treatment is also diagnostic. COPD commonly causes chronic cough, but most patients presenting with chronic cough do not have undiagnosed COPD. Signs and symptoms suggestive of asthma also occur in persons with COPD. Spirometry is diagnostic, and purulent sputum production may also be present.

Treatment includes an inhaled bronchodilator, inhaled anticholinergic, inhaled corticosteroid, and a one- to two-week course of oral corticosteroids.
18. NONASTHMATIC EOSINOPHILIC BRONCHITIS Nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis is characterized by chronic cough in patients with no symptoms or objective evidence of variable airflow obstruction, normal airway responsiveness on a methacholine inhalation test, and sputum eosinophilia. Options for Refractory Cough Patients with unexplained chronic cough after evaluation and treatment of common causes should be referred to a pulmonologist or otolaryngologist. UACS is rare in children younger than six years, and antihistamines and decongestants are not recommended.

### An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: the clinical utility of bronchoalveolar lavage cellular analysis in interstitial lung disease [^32afd9ca]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The clinical utility of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) cell analysis for the diagnosis and management of patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) has been a subject of debate and controversy. The American Thoracic Society (ATS) sponsored a committee of international experts to examine all relevant literature on BAL in ILD and provide recommendations concerning the use of BAL in the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected ILD.

Purpose

To provide recommendations for (1) the performance and processing of BAL and (2) the interpretation of BAL nucleated immune cell patterns and other BAL characteristics in patients with suspected ILD.

Methods

A pragmatic systematic review was performed to identify unique citations related to BAL in patients with ILD that were published between 1970 and 2006. The search was updated during the guideline development process to include published literature through March 2011. This is the evidence upon which the committee's conclusions and recommendations are based.

Results

Recommendations for the performance and processing of BAL, as well as the interpretation of BAL findings, were formulated by the committee.

Conclusions

When used in conjunction with comprehensive clinical information and adequate thoracic imaging such as high-resolution computed tomography of the thorax, BAL cell patterns and other characteristics frequently provide useful information for the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected ILD.

For distinguishing fibrotic HP from IPF, BAL fluid lymphocyte thresholds of 20%, 30%, and 40% yielded sensitivities of 69%, 55%, and 41%, respectively, and specificities of 61%, 80%, and 93% respectively, with an area under the curve of 0.54 (95% CI, 0.51–0.58). For distinguishing fibrotic HP from sarcoidosis, BAL fluid lymphocyte thresholds of 20%, 30%, and 40% yielded sensitivities of 69%, 55%, and 41%, respectively, and specificities of 26%, 43%, and 61% respectively, with an area under the curve of 0.44 (95% CI, 0.41–0.47). Finally, for distinguishing nonfibrotic HP from sarcoidosis, BAL fluid lymphocyte thresholds of 20%, 30%, and 40% yielded sensitivities of 95%, 88%, and 76%, respectively, and specificities of 26%, 43%, and 61% respectively, with an area under the curve of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.67–0.74). A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess potential inclusion bias (overestimation of sensitivity and specificity due to the inclusion of studies that used BAL fluid lymphocytosis as a diagnostic criterion for HP); the results remained the same, and the studies were therefore kept in the final analysis.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^21a01e4d]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for hypersensitivity pneumonitis, more specifically with respect to bronchoalveolar lavage, ACCP 2021 guidelines recommend to do not perform routine bronchoalveolar lavage fluid analysis to confirm the diagnosis in patients with suspected HP having a compelling exposure history within the appropriate clinical context and a chest HRCT pattern typical for HP.

### Diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis in adults. An official ATS / JRS / ALAT clinical practice guideline [^9c9a9427]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

The primary goal in the diagnosis of ILD is to make a confident diagnosis using the least invasive approach. HP can be diagnosed with high confidence in patients in whom an exposure has been identified and who have a typical HP pattern at HRCT and have BAL lymphocytosis; such patients do not require additional testing. Patients with any other combination of exposure history, HRCT pattern, and BAL results should undergo an MDD that includes an experienced expert in ILD (pulmonologist), a chest radiologist, and, if transbronchial lung biopsies were performed at the time of BAL, a pathologist familiar with histopathological features of interstitial pneumonias and HP. Additional histopathological sampling should be considered after the MDD in some patients with a high-confidence diagnosis, moderate-confidence diagnosis, or low-confidence diagnosis or in patients for whom an alternative diagnosis has not been established. A low-confidence diagnosis may be adequate in patients for whom the differential diagnosis has been sufficiently narrowed such that further investigations are unlikely to alter management, when invasive testing has unacceptable risks, or when such tests are declined by the patient. The diagnosis should be reconsidered at subsequent visits, particularly for patients without a definite diagnosis.

High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT)–exposure–BAL/histopathology confidence matrix for hypersensitivity pneumonitis (Figure 6) indicates that HRCT categories "Typical for HP," "Compatible with HP," and "Indeterminate for HP" are crossed with "Exposure +" or "Exposure –" under "History of exposure and/or serum IgG testing" and with rows for "No BAL or BAL without lymphocytosis and either no histopathology or indeterminate histopathology," "BAL lymphocytosis without histopathology sampling," "BAL lymphocytosis with indeterminate histopathology," "Probable HP histopathology," and "Typical HP histopathology"; cells display diagnostic certainty levels including "Definite," "High confidence," "Moderate confidence," "Low confidence," and "Not excluded." The caption states that "All confidence levels are subject to multidisciplinary discussion," and adds, "Confidence may increase to "definite" if the pathologist's conclusion persists after reevaluation in the context of additional clinical information or an expert second opinion on histopathology."

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis — BAL cellular analysis evidence: Following a review of 566 studies, three single-centered retrospective studies on BAL cellular analysis in HP met inclusion criteria. In a cohort of 710 interstitial lung disease patients (66 clinically diagnosed with HP), all without immunomodulatory therapy, BAL procedural quality thresholds included recovery of ≥ 25 mL, viability ≥ 75%, and ≥ 15% epithelial cells; when BAL showed > 4% neutrophils and a lymphocyte count of < 30%, 30% to 50%, or > 50%, the likelihood of HP changed from 9.3% to 3.2%, 35.7%, or 43%, respectively. In another cohort of 77 patients with an MDD diagnosis of HP, 53 (69%) underwent BAL (14 nonfibrotic HP, 39 fibrotic HP); the median BAL lymphocyte count was higher in nonfibrotic HP at 46% (range, 20%-80%) compared to fibrotic HP at 19% (range, 11%-41%), and no difference was observed in proportions using lymphocyte cutoffs > 20%, > 30%, or > 40%.

### Alveolar cell composition in interstitial lung disease and the development of a pulmonary progressive fibrosing phenotype: a retrospective cohort study [^15bfb736]. Respiratory Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Interstitial lung diseases (ILDs) encompass a diverse spectrum of respiratory conditions characterised by interstitial fibrosis and inflammation. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) emerges as the most prevalent and severe variant within this spectrum, marked by progressive fibrosis, worsening respiratory symptoms, declining respiratory function, and poor survival. Developing progressive pulmonary fibrosis is not limited to IPF and can extend to other ILDs, including other idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs) (e.g. idiopathic non-specific interstitial pneumonia (iNSIP), connective tissue disease (CTD)-related ILDs, hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), drug-induced ILDs, and sarcoidosis). Approximately 25% of non-IPF ILD patients are estimated to develop a progressive phenotype, according to the PROGRESS study. Due to their clinical and pathogenic similarities to IPF, these patients are referred to as having a progressive pulmonary fibrosis (PPF) phenotype.

Amidst the challenges in diagnosing and predicting the rate of decline of PPF, a growing imperative exists for effective diagnostic tools and early intervention strategies. Despite the widely recognised importance of early detection, current PPF diagnosis relies primarily on indicators of advanced disease. These include clinical deterioration, pulmonary function tests (PFTs), and radiological findings that often signify irreversible damage. This approach potentially narrows the window for effective therapeutic interventions, underscoring the need for more proactive diagnostic methods.

Immunological bronchoalveolar lavage (iBAL) is a minimally invasive diagnostic procedure and is used to provide direction to the correct ILD diagnosis. During the procedure, alveolar cells are collected by lavage of the alveolar compartment using a flexible bronchoscope. Subsequently, cellular composition is analysed, providing valuable insights for supporting or excluding specific diagnoses. Recent ATS/JRS/ALAT clinical practice guidelines mention that lymphocyte analysis of iBAL cellular contents can play a crucial role in distinguishing fibrotic HP from sarcoidosis and IPF. Additionally, characteristic patterns for eosinophilic pneumonia and sarcoidosis can be discerned through iBAL cellular analysis.

Future Directions

The guideline committee recognized an urgent need to improve knowledge on several topics, including 1) understanding the nature and pathophysiology of HP, 2) diagnostic approaches, 3) disease behavior and natural history, and 4) therapeutic approaches. Key questions on pathophysiology include genetic susceptibility and both host and environmental factors. For diagnostic approaches, important needs include the validation and standardization of questionnaires, BAL lymphocytosis threshold, specific antibodies, and biomarkers. In addition, new techniques like genomic classifiers and artificial intelligence to improve diagnosis and prognosis need to be assessed. Questions about disease behavior range from prevention to the phenotyping of HP. Regarding phenotyping, the differences between predominantly inflammatory and fibrotic subtypes are important questions. Finally, now that this guideline has established a standardized diagnostic approach to HP, future work needs to address the management of the different subtypes of HP in clinical trials and other research. For a full list of questions deemed important by the guideline committee, see the online supplement.

Registries can play an important role in acquiring knowledge. To maximize their potential, HP-specific registries are needed. Such registries would be particularly helpful in determining the worldwide and national incidence and prevalence of all HP, subtypes of HP (i.e. fibrotic and nonfibrotic HP), and phenotypes of HP (e.g. HP with autoimmune features, HP with progressive fibrotic behavior, etc.), including those without an identifiable inciting agent by serum IgG testing against potential antigens associated with HP and a thorough evaluation. Registries can also help us understand the frequencies of various detectable and nondetectable exposures and can serve as a biobank for blood and tissue specimens, chest HRCT images, and antigen quantification from the home and workplace.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^d1979a11]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Panel discussion — biopsy strategy and test interpretation in hypersensitivity pneumonitis states that evidence on diagnostic utility of histological features is of very low quality and that the guideline panel does not suggest performing lung biopsy in subjects with a high level of pre-biopsy diagnostic certainty; in such subjects, the data suggest that the finding of HP histopathological features by transbronchial biopsy (TBB) is possibly much less than 50%, so negative TBB specimens should not be used to rule out HP; in the context of multidisciplinary discussion, the clinician should consider that pathological TBB findings supportive of HP together with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) lymphocytosis may preclude the need for more invasive testing such as surgical lung biopsy (SLB) or transbronchial cryobiopsy (TBC); the minimum number of TBB or TBC specimens needed to balance diagnostic yield and complication rate remains unanswered, and research is needed on the additive value of BAL fluid analysis with either biopsy method in patients with intermediate pretest probability of HP or varying severity.

Transbronchial biopsy (TBB) diagnostic yield in HP — "Three single-center observational studies" met inclusion criteria. In one study of HP diagnosed by multidisciplinary discussion, "TBB was performed in 72 (46%) patients" of "155 subjects" and was "characteristic of HP… in 29 of the 72 (40%) patients." In the same cohort, "in 12/26 (46%) patients with < 20% lymphocytes on BAL, TBB specimens were suggestive of HP," with "no difference between nonfibrotic and fibrotic patients." Adding TBB to BAL "substantially increased diagnostic yield regardless of the BAL lymphocyte cutoff (20%, 30%, or 40%) used, particularly among subjects with fibrotic HP." A second study reported "an analysis of 105 TBBs from 55 cases of acute HP… including the presence of ≥ 22% lymphocytes," with further details beyond this page.

The document adds, "The remaining sample may be used for microbiological, virological, and/or malignant cell cytology laboratory testing, if clinically indicated," and explains that routine analysis helps identify or exclude a predominantly inflammatory cellular pattern that may support a specific ILD or narrow the differential diagnosis when integrated with clinical and radiological findings.

Natural history and prognosis — The clinical course of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) ranges "from improvement to progressive decline and death due to respiratory failure." Patients with nonfibrotic HP who avoid ongoing exposure "may have a favorable prognosis with the possibility of stabilization or full recovery," whereas "Patients with fibrotic HP, particularly those with a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)-like pattern, have reduced survival." Poor prognostic features include "cigarette smoking, lower baseline VC, lack of BAL lymphocytosis, persistent exposure to the inciting agent, and/or inability to identify an inciting agent," and "an inciting agent is not identified in 30–50% of cases evaluated at ILD referral centers."

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) lymphocyte analysis — retrospective fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD) cohort: In individuals with fibrotic ILD of unknown cause who are clinically suspected of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and have usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP)-like high-resolution CT (HRCT) findings, BAL cellular analysis may help separate IPF from fibrotic HP, and in a retrospective series of undiagnosed fibrotic ILDs with an indeterminate UIP pattern, the mean BAL lymphocyte percentage was higher in fibrotic HP than IPF (24.1 ± 15.4 vs 11.4 ± 6.2), with revaluation driven by BAL leading to a change in diagnosis in 14 patients (15%), most commonly from IPF to fibrotic HP in 11/14 [79%].

Committee discussion

The evidence synthesis estimated that serum IgG testing against HP-associated antigens distinguishes HP from other ILDs with a sensitivity and specificity of 83% and 68%, respectively. The committee was unanimous in the opinion that both test characteristics are suboptimal. Most committee members considered testing convenient and adequate for generating supportive data; however, they acknowledged that testing is insufficient for confirming or excluding a diagnosis of HP because the test characteristics are inferior to most screening tests currently in use.

It was emphasized that a positive serum IgG result does not mean that the exposure is the cause of the lung condition; it only indicates that the patient has likely been exposed to a potential cause of HP at some point in his or her life, and it may be worthy of further consideration to explore the source of the potential causative agent in the patient's domestic, social, and/or work environment before assignment of a diagnosis of HP, particularly when other diagnostic findings of HP are less certain (e.g. no BAL lymphocytosis, probable or indeterminate CT or biopsy patterns).

The committee acknowledged the lack of standardization of serum IgG testing against potential antigens associated with HP, with no standardized, internationally accepted "HP panel" and different commercial kits being used by different laboratories. In addition, there was discussion of how the performance of serum IgG testing may vary with some serum IgG testing being more helpful with some antigens than others and in some parts of the world. Development and validation of a standard or personalized hypersensitivity panel was considered a priority for future clinical investigation.

Summary of evidence

A systematic search of the literature identified 1,500 potentially relevant articles. The full text of 340 articles was reviewed, and 84 observational studies were selected to inform the guideline committee (,–). Most studies enrolled patients with known HP or other types of ILD, performed BAL with lymphocyte cellular analysis, and compared the percentage of lymphocytes among patients with different conditions. Farmer's lung and bird fancier's lung disease were the most common types of HP, whereas IPF and sarcoidosis were the most common non-HP ILDs enrolled.

A meta-analysis of 36 studies (1,643 patients) demonstrated that patients with HP had a higher proportion of BAL fluid lymphocytes than patients with IPF (mean difference [MD], 30%; 95% CI, 27–34%). This effect was seen regardless of whether the study enrolled patients with nonfibrotic HP (9 studies; MD, 34%; 95% CI, 29–40%), fibrotic HP (12 studies; MD, 21%; 95% CI, 14–27%), or mixed populations with both nonfibrotic and fibrotic HP (15 studies; MD, 36%; 95% CI, 32–40%).

Similarly, a meta-analysis of 53 studies (3,112 patients) demonstrated that patients with HP had a higher proportion of BAL fluid lymphocytes than patients with sarcoidosis (MD, 19%; 95% CI, 17–21%). This effect was seen regardless of whether the study enrolled patients with nonfibrotic HP (17 studies; MD, 25%; 95% CI, 22–27%), fibrotic HP (16 studies; MD, 16%; 95% CI, 11–20%), or mixed populations with both nonfibrotic and fibrotic HP (21 studies; MD, 18%; 95% CI, 15–20%).

In studies with few patients, HP was compared with other ILDs, including CTD-ILD, idiopathic NSIP, and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, but the number of patients was too small to make meaningful comparisons.

Methods

A multidisciplinary (pulmonologists, radiologists, methodologists, pathologists, and patient) panel of experts from the ATS, JRS, and ALAT was composed to identify clinically important questions about diagnostic testing for HP among patients with newly identified ILD. The CPG was created in two parts. The first portion describes clinical, radiological, and pathological features of HP while proposing a definition, diagnostic criteria, and a diagnostic algorithm. It was approached in a consensus fashion and informed by a nonsystematic review of the literature. The second portion makes graded recommendations that answer questions about whether to perform a diagnostic intervention. It was informed by National Academy of Medicine–adherent guideline methodology, including a full systematic review for each question and the formulation, writing, and grading of recommendations using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. For a detailed description of the methods, see the online supplement.

Implications of the different degrees of recommendation are described in Table 1. Using the GRADE approach, each recommendation was rated as either a "recommendation" or a "suggestion." The meaning of a recommendation is the same as a strong recommendation in typical GRADE nomenclature, and the meaning of a suggestion is the same as a weak or conditional recommendation in typical GRADE nomenclature. Typical GRADE nomenclature was altered for this guideline to address prior criticism that the term "conditional" created uncertainty in the context of translation into non-English languages.

### The revised ATS / ERS / JRS / ALAT diagnostic criteria for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) – practical implications [^9de1f18a]. Respiratory Research (2013). Low credibility.

Regarding the first scenario (typical clinical and HRCT features of IPF), it is likely that most clinicians would agree that an additional diagnostic test is not required. As occasional patients have uncertain exposures, which might or might not be relevant to a diagnosis of HP, a weak negative recommendation for the use of BAL, reserved for those patients, seems appropriate. However, even this apparently logical conclusion can be questioned. In a study by Ohshimo et al. of the diagnostic significance of a BAL lymphocytosis when the clinical and HRCT presentation is typical of IPF, a BAL lymphocytosis of > 30% was present in six out of 74 patients and in all six cases an alternative diagnosis to IPF was made. The change in diagnostic perception was validated by surgical biopsy in two cases, and by the subsequent outcome (which was not typical of IPF) in four cases. This finding, applying to a handful of patients, needs to be reproduced in multicenter studies with a larger cohort of patients before major changes in the recommendation are considered.

By contrast, when the diagnosis of IPF is "suspected" and, thus, by definition, uncertain, most European clinicians would favour the performance of BAL, with findings expected to radically alter the likelihood of alternative diagnoses. This view was endorsed by formal voting in a large European-wide meeting of clinicians with expertise in IPF and flies directly in the face of the ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT 2011 recommendation. This is likely to reflect the fact that the ATS/ERS/JRS/ALAT recommendation covered two such dissimilar clinical scenarios with a single recommendation, although cultural differences between Europe and the USA in the performance of BAL might also have played an important role. However, irrespective of the source of confusion, there is a perceived need for separate recommendations to address the two distinct clinical scenarios, as in the British Thoracic Society (BTS) guidelines on the diagnosis and management of interstitial lung disease. In the BTS guidelines, the diagnostic use of BAL was reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis is uncertain after clinical assessment and HRCT scanning, with the case by case exclusion of patients with severe disease or because a biopsy will ultimately be performed. It can be argued that a similar statement is now required for the specific diagnosis of IPF, with the two key clinical scenarios clearly distinguished.

### Executive summary: diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^f314ca5a]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The purpose of this summary is to provide a synopsis of evidence-based and consensus-derived guidance for clinicians to improve individual diagnostic decision-making for hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) and decrease diagnostic practice variability.

Study Design and Methods

Approved panelists developed key questions regarding the diagnosis of HP using the PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome) format. MEDLINE (via PubMed) and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched for relevant literature, which was supplemented by manual searches. References were screened for inclusion and vetted evaluation tools were used to assess the quality of included studies, to extract data, and to grade the level of evidence supporting each recommendation or statement. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. Graded recommendations and ungraded consensus-based statements were drafted and voted on using a modified Delphi technique to achieve consensus.

Results

The systematic review of the literature based on 14 PICO questions resulted in 14 key action statements: 12 evidence-based, graded recommendations, and 2 ungraded consensus-based statements. All evidence was of very low quality.

Interpretation

Diagnosis of HP should employ a patient-centered approach and include a multidisciplinary assessment that incorporates the environmental and occupational exposure history and CT pattern to establish diagnostic confidence prior to considering BAL and/or lung biopsy. Additional research is needed on the performance characteristics and generalizability of exposure assessment tools and traditional and new diagnostic tests in modifying clinical decision-making for HP, particularly among those with a provisional diagnosis.

### BAL fluid cellular analysis and radiologic patterns in patients with fibrotic interstitial lung disease [^3e586356]. Chest (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

BAL cellular analysis is often recommended during the initial diagnostic evaluation of fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD). Despite recommendation for its use, between-center heterogeneity exists and supportive data concerning the clinical utility and correlation of BAL findings with radiologic features or patterns remain sparse.

Research Question

In patients with fibrotic ILD, are BAL findings associated with radiologic features, patterns, and clinical diagnoses?

Study Design and Methods

Patients with fibrotic ILD who underwent BAL for diagnostic evaluation and who were enrolled in the prospective Canadian Registry for Pulmonary Fibrosis were re-reviewed in a standardized multidisciplinary discussion (MDD). BAL was categorized according to guideline-recommended thresholds, and using thresholds of lymphocytosis > 20% and neutrophils > 4.5%. High-resolution CT (HRCT) scans were scored (anonymized to clinical data) for specific features and percentage lung involvement. Radiologists classified HRCT scans according to guideline-defined patterns for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis; then, MDD diagnoses were assigned, considering all available data.

Results

Bronchoscopy with cellular analysis was performed in 209 of 1,593 patients (13%). Lymphocyte % was weakly negatively correlated with total fibrosis % (r = -0.16, P = 0.023) but not statistically significantly correlated with ground glass opacity % (r = 0.01, P = 0.94). A mixed BAL pattern was the most frequent in all radiologic patterns (range, 45%-69%), with a minority classifiable according to BAL guidelines. BAL lymphocytosis appeared with similar frequency across HRCT patterns of fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis (21%) and usual interstitial pneumonia (18%). Only 5% of patients with MDD-based fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis had a guideline-defined isolated lymphocytosis > 15%.

Interpretation

BAL cellular analyses did not significantly correlate with radiologic features, guideline patterns, or MDD-based diagnoses. Ground glass opacities are often interpreted to represent pulmonary inflammation, but were not associated with BAL lymphocytosis in this cohort.

The diagnostic criteria are presented in a way that explicitly conveys the diagnostic confidence associated with common combinations of specific features. We used an approach similar to the approach proposed by an international working group, which categorized ILD diagnoses on the basis of confidence. We categorized diagnoses as definite (≥ 90% confidence), high-confidence (80–89%), moderate-confidence (70–79%), and low-confidence (51–69%) diagnoses. This approach is supported by recent studies suggesting the potential therapeutic and prognostic utility of assigning diagnostic confidence in this manner.

Criteria and an algorithm for establishing a diagnosis of HP are provided in Figures 6 and 7, which may be applied to patients with a clinical presentation consistent with either fibrotic or nonfibrotic HP. Both were developed through iterative discussion and consensus by the full guideline committee on the basis of the evidence syntheses and recommendations presented below, supplemented by the guideline committee's collective clinical experience.

### Diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis in adults. An official ATS / JRS / ALAT clinical practice guideline [^3d70ab04]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) definition and classification — HP is an inflammatory and/or fibrotic disease affecting the lung parenchyma and small airways, and it typically results from an immune-mediated reaction provoked by an overt or occult inhaled antigen in susceptible individuals. Because the presence of radiographic or histopathological fibrosis is the primary determinant of prognosis, the guideline committee decided unanimously to categorize HP as either fibrotic (mixed inflammatory plus fibrotic or purely fibrotic) or nonfibrotic (purely inflammatory), and when patients have mixed features the categorization is determined by the predominance of features.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^3aae1165]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) diagnostic workup — role of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) lymphocytosis and biopsy is outlined as follows: BAL fluid lymphocytosis is unlikely to substantially change posttest diagnostic certainty in this scenario, but when exposure is identified and CT imaging is compatible with HP, BAL fluid lymphocytosis may provide additional support for a provisional high confidence diagnosis after careful multidisciplinary evaluation, and if exposure is indeterminate or unidentified with CT typical of HP, BAL fluid lymphocytosis may provide additional support for a provisional high-confidence diagnosis. When CT imaging is compatible with HP, the overall posttest probability of HP is higher with an indeterminate IA than with an unidentified IA, and in either setting further testing such as VATS or TBC may be considered, particularly in the absence of BAL fluid lymphocytosis, if a confident diagnosis is sought. If histological sampling is pursued and pre-VATS or TBC confidence is low, a confident diagnosis can be made when a biopsy is typical for HP and reviewed through a multidisciplinary evaluation; if the biopsy is indeterminate for HP or compatible with HP, a provisional diagnosis can be made after careful consensus MDD. If pre-VATS or TBC diagnosis confidence is unlikely for HP, a biopsy showing typical histopathology for HP may lead to an MDD provisional diagnosis, and in this situation a confident diagnosis is sometimes made, especially when MDD prompts review and revision of the initial clinical context. Referral to an ILD center is suggested for patients with a provisional HP diagnosis.

### An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline: the clinical utility of bronchoalveolar lavage cellular analysis in interstitial lung disease [^64fdbddd]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society guideline — bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cellular analysis in interstitial lung disease (ILD) should be accurately interpreted only when the procedure and specimen handling are proper, and following the initial clinical and radiographic evaluation of suspected ILD, BAL cellular analysis may be a useful adjunct in individuals who lack a confident usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) imaging of the thorax. Important considerations about whether to perform a BAL include the degree of uncertainty about the type of ILD, the likelihood that the BAL will provide helpful information, the patient's cardiopulmonary stability, the presence or absence of a bleeding diathesis, and the patient's values and preferences. Recognition of a predominantly, inflammatory cellular pattern (increased lymphocytes, eosinophils, or neutrophils) in the BAL differential cell profile frequently helps the clinician narrow the differential diagnosis of ILD, even though such patterns are nonspecific. A normal BAL differential cell profile does not exclude microscopic abnormalities in the lung tissue.

Diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) in adults — initial recommendations and scope: HP must be considered in the differential diagnosis for patients with newly identified interstitial lung disease (ILD). The guideline committee categorized HP into clinical phenotypes — nonfibrotic and fibrotic HP — and, for patients with clinical and radiographic manifestations suggestive of nonfibrotic HP, makes no recommendation or suggestion for or against the use of a questionnaire to identify potential HP inciting agents and sources; instead, it recommends development and validation of a questionnaire and advocates that clinicians take a thorough history to identify potential exposures and sources known to be associated with HP. For this nonfibrotic population, the committee also suggests performing serum IgG testing that targets potential antigens associated with HP.

Diagnostic Criteria

The diagnosis of HP requires integration of multiple domains that are ideally considered in the context of an MDD. Given the multitude of presenting features, fibrotic HP should be considered in the differential diagnosis for all patients with a fibrotic ILD. This is particularly challenging, given the absence of an identifiable exposure in up to 50% of patients with fibrotic HP (,–). Nonfibrotic HP is usually associated with a clear exposure and less frequently poses a diagnostic dilemma, but it similarly lacks a single diagnostic pathway. For these reasons, a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach is important in diagnosing HP, particularly fibrotic HP; however, there remains substantial diagnostic disagreement across experienced MDD teams that likely reflects the absence of standardized diagnostic criteria.

Previous studies have identified features that increase the likelihood of HP, with diagnostic algorithms or criteria proposed by multiple groups (,–). The studies on which these proposals are based all have methodological limitations, most notably incorporation bias (e.g. serum IgG and BAL studies), incomplete consideration of all potentially informative features, absence of appropriate control groups, and inadequate validation (e.g. questionnaires). Despite these limitations, some key features are consistently identified as increasing the likelihood of an HP diagnosis, including exposure to a known offending agent, typical imaging findings, and typical biopsy findings. BAL lymphocytosis is an important feature; serum-specific immunoglobulins might also be helpful. Female sex, midinspiratory squeaks (or chirping rales or squawks), absence of a smoking history, and obstructive or mixed restrictive/obstructive physiology have also been identified as potential predictors of an HP diagnosis, but with more limited diagnostic utility. Other features are less frequently identified (e.g. episodes of symptoms and symptoms 4–8 h after exposure), likely reflecting variable proportions of fibrotic and nonfibrotic HP in previous studies.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^ae192110]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) diagnosis — future directions: The panel recognizes the need for improved reporting of sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratio, predictive values, and ROCs and the minimization of systematic and random errors, and identifies a need to validate studies evaluating diagnostic and exposure assessment testing, particularly in subjects with a provisional diagnosis of HP; future diagnostic studies in HP should adhere to diagnostic reporting guidelines and address estimates of disease prevalence and IA exposure, descriptions of study populations or spectrum of HP subjects, and details of the MDD consensus diagnostic process. Exposure information from national or regional registries can provide pretest estimates of HP for diagnostic studies according to geographic location, and further research is needed on quantitative antigen-specific antibody panels and immunoassays as adjuncts to indoor environmental IA investigations in patients with an indeterminate or suspected exposure. BAL diagnostic thresholds and confidence intervals should be further studied, the additive discriminative diagnostic yield of TBB when added to BAL and test independence, as well as the diagnostic yield and test independence of BAL when added to TBC, are unknown and require further study, and the diagnostic performance characteristics of TBC in modifying the pretest likelihood of HP in the context of MDD need to be established. The interobserver agreement of the recommended diagnostic confidence classification in a stepwise and transparent MDD approach should be investigated, and there is a critical need to evaluate the diagnostic yield and validity of molecular markers for discriminating fibrotic HP from other fibrotic ILDs and the potential enhanced diagnostic accuracy compared to clinical variables alone.

Purpose Of Review

Establishing a diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) and distinguishing it from other forms of interstitial lung diseases represents a common challenge in clinical practice. This review summarizes the latest literature and guidelines on HP while integrating some real-life conundrums.

Recent Findings

Advances in the understanding of the pathobiology of fibrotic HP and other progressive pulmonary fibrosis have changed how we approach the diagnosis and treatment of interstitial lung disease. Classifications now embrace distinguishing two clinical phenotypes: nonfibrotic and fibrotic HP because of distinct disease behavior and prognosis implications. International guidelines on HP were recently published and proposed a framework and algorithm to guide the diagnostic process.

Summary

The diagnosis of HP relies on the integration of multiples domains: clinical assessment of exposure, imaging, bronchoalveolar lavage lymphocytosis and histopathological findings. These features are reviewed in multidisciplinary discussion and lead to an estimation of the degree of confidence for HP diagnosis. Further research is warranted to improve knowledge on the pathophysiology of HP and ultimately improve its diagnostic approaches.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) diagnostic triage and early steps — For patients with no current exposures who are male former smokers > 60 years old, the 2018 ATS/ERS/ALAT guidelines on the diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) should be followed, with the initial steps including a high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan followed by a multidisciplinary discussion (MDD). For all other patients with newly identified fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD), the decision which clinical practice guideline (CPG) to initially follow should be made on a case-by-case basis. Regardless of which CPG is followed, the initial steps are similar, and ongoing diagnostic evaluation may be redirected on the basis of the MDD.

Results

A total of 148 (88 fibrotic and 60 non-fibrotic) of 224 screened patients with suspected HP who underwent bronchoscopy were included in the study (case selection presented in Fig. 1). Baseline clinical characteristics and criteria meeting recent consensus guidance for HP diagnosis are presented in Table 1. Fibrotic patients were slightly older (65 vs 60, P < 0.0001) with no differences in sex, smoking history, frequency of solicited exposure or serology findings. Fibrotic patients also had lower pulmonary function findings compared to non-fibrotic. Frequency of positive exposure history and precipitin testing was similar between fibrotic and non-fibrotic patients, dominated by avian antigen. Of note, exposure history was solicited and unknown in 43% of fibrotic patients, compared to 23% of those without fibrosis. Specific radiologic findings including GGO (78%) and mosaic attenuation (65%) were found commonly in patients with f-HP, with centrilobular nodules (17%) and honeycombing (17%) occurring less frequently. Histopathology was dominated by consistent or probable HP findings (83% in fibrotic, 95% in non-fibrotic). Based on combinations of clinical findings, 'moderate' diagnostic confidence levels were reached in the majority of fibrotic and non-fibrotic pts (62% and 58% respectively), followed by 'high' (24% vs 25% respectively) and 'definite' (14% and 17% respectively).

BAL percent differential and lymphocyte findings as stratified by fibrotic and non-fibrotic subgroups are presented in Table 2. Median BALL was 15% (IQR 3–31) in fibrotic patients compared to 19% (IQR 10–47) in non-fibrotic (P = 0.005). Among patients with fibrotic disease, the largest proportion were those with BALL less than 10% (42%). Only 28% of patients with f-HP had BALL ≥ 30% compared to 41% of patients with non-fibrotic disease (P = 0.09).

### Hypersensitivity pneumonitis: updates in evaluation, management, and ongoing dilemmas [^d56790af]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP) is a heterogenous disease entity characterized by an aberrant immune response to inhalational antigens. Disease modification hinges on early antigen remediation with a goal to attenuate immune dysregulation. Disease severity and progression are mediated by an interface between degree, type and chronicity of exposure, genetic predisposition, and biochemical properties of the inducing agent. Guidelines have provided a standardized approach; however, decision-making remains with many clinical dilemmas. The delineation of fibrotic and nonfibrotic HP is crucial to identify the differences in clinical trajectories, and further clinical trials are needed to understand optimal therapeutic strategies.

### Performance of a diagnostic algorithm for fibrotic hypersensitivity pneumonitis. A case-control study [^3548683b]. Respiratory Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Identification of the inciting antigen is crucial for HP diagnosis and management. In patients with an identified antigen diagnostic confidence for HP is higher, the danger of IPF misclassification is lower, and prognosis is more favorable. However, in less than 50% of patients an antigen can be identified. We confirm that a systematic exposure assessment is helpful for antigen identification. With a questionnaire tailored to local practice we identified an antigen exposure in 74% of HP cases, but also in 34% of IPF cases, which underlines the low specificity of patient-reported antigen exposure, and the need for estimation of potential causality by the clinician. Testing of specific serum IgG levels can confirm exposure to the antigen at some point in the patient's life, without prove of causality to the ILD.

BAL lymphocytosis is important for HP diagnosis, either as a piece of information to the MDD or as a formal diagnostic criterion or integrated in an algorithm. However, the optimal BAL lymphocytosis cut-off still needs to be determined: A recent meta-analysis demonstrated an optimized sensitivity (71%) and specificity (68%) for a 21% lymphocytosis threshold, and a threshold of 20% has been proposed to decide if a surgical lung biopsy for suspected HP is needed. Conversely, most ILD experts indicated that they find a threshold of 40% to be useful for the diagnosis of chronic HP, and experts contributing to the new diagnostic guidelines indicated that they find a threshold of 30% reasonable. Likely different thresholds are valid for different positions of BAL in a diagnostic algorithm.

Histopathological features of HP — Lung biopsy often plays a pivotal role in diagnosis. The findings that make a diagnosis of HP likely apply to both nonfibrotic (cellular) and fibrotic variants, differing by the presence or absence of a fibrotic pattern that may overlap histologically with fibrotic IPF. For nonfibrotic, or cellular, HP, a confident histopathological diagnosis requires typical features including: 1) a cellular interstitial pneumonia accentuated around small airways ("bronchiolocentric") with 2) a cellular chronic bronchiolitis, 3) a distinctive pattern of granulomatous inflammation, and 4) no histopathological features to suggest a more likely alternative.

### Diagnosis and evaluation of hypersensitivity pneumonitis: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^6c8b00de]. Chest (2021). High credibility.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis — role of histologic lung biopsy and panel guidance emphasizes contextual interpretation: open lung biopsy review in 88 patients with ILDs (10 with HP and 78 with non-HP ILDs) found none of the 88 diagnosed with HP based on histology alone, with three diagnosed based on histology plus clinical information and 10 by interdisciplinary case evaluation. The panel states that evidence of the diagnostic utility of lung biopsy is of very low quality, and based on preliminary evidence, the combination of TBB and BAL might provide a higher diagnostic yield than either technique alone and may obviate SLB or TBC. The guideline panel suggests that the yield of TBC may be similar to that of SLB and that appropriate patient selection is required; assessment of the HP pretest probability is essential and explicit clinical reasoning in a consensus MDD is recommended to assess SLB or TBC appropriateness. When pathology is indeterminate or discordant with context or HRCT, re-review by a thoracic pathologist with an ILD team at expert centers is suggested. Considering disease severity and patient factors, refining the working diagnosis by histological lung biopsy sampling is unnecessary if a definite HP diagnosis is unlikely to change management. In subjects with an intermediate or low pretest probability of HP, no clinical measures or imaging predictors are currently available that diagnostically distinguish fibrotic HP from other fibrotic ILDs.

Hypersensitivity pneumonia (HP) refers to a heterogeneous group of interstitial lung diseases resulting from a non-IgE immune-mediated reaction to inhaled pathogens in susceptible and sensitized hosts. Environmental and genetic factors are important substrates of disease pathogenesis. A recurrent or ongoing airborne exposure results in activation of humoral and cellular immune responses. This article discusses key clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic features of HP and reviews current recommendations.

### Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis update: reconciliation with hypersensitivity pneumonitis guidelines required? [^e62597ff]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

To the Editor:

Clinicians welcome the updated idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) clinical practice guidelines recently published in the Journal. Raghu and a multidisciplinary group of experts did a great job at providing evidence-based recommendations and suggestions to guide clinicians in the diagnosis and management of IPF and progressive pulmonary fibrosis. However, the updated IPF guidelines do not emphasize the role of ruling out known causes of usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) or probable UIP patterns on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest, as previous guidelines did. In particular, they do not address the role of BAL in the diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), arguably the most important differential diagnosis of IPF. Furthermore, in the diagnostic algorithm proposed in the guidelines in Figure 10, the authors do not recommend or suggest any additional testing in patients with UIP or probable UIP pattern on HRCT to rule out HP.

Hence, how do current guidelines reconcile with recent HP guidelines, which suggest that, in patients with UIP or probable UIP pattern on HRCT (called indeterminate for HP pattern in the HP guidelines), BAL is required to define the diagnosis? It would have been very helpful if the current guidelines had provided further clarification on this matter.
