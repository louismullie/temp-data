Give me answer and why

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which anticoagulant directly inhibits thrombin among the listed options for stroke prophylaxis in atrial fibrillation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanism of action for each option. Then, I should verify which agents are approved for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation. Next, I will distinguish direct thrombin inhibition from indirect mechanisms. Finally, I will confirm the correct choice and briefly justify why the others are incorrect.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and the key mechanism we are looking for: stroke prophylaxis in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation with an agent that directly inhibits thrombin, meaning it binds thrombin itself rather than acting via a cofactor like antithrombin III [^c8329ce9] [^d0431501].

> Now, I will examine each option mechanistically. Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent that irreversibly inhibits cyclooxygenase-1 and reduces thromboxane A2–mediated platelet aggregation; it does not inhibit thrombin, so I should rule it out. Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist that suppresses hepatic synthesis of vitamin K–dependent clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X; it acts indirectly and upstream of thrombin, so it is not a direct thrombin inhibitor, and I should exclude it as well [^903af159]. Heparin, whether unfractionated or low molecular weight, works by binding antithrombin III and accelerating inhibition of thrombin and factor Xa; this is indirect thrombin inhibition, not direct, so heparin is not the correct answer here [^b203f8ee] [^71c8ca6d]. Dabigatran, in contrast, is a direct thrombin inhibitor that binds competitively to the active site of thrombin, inhibiting both free and clot-bound thrombin without requiring a cofactor, which matches the question's criterion [^d0431501] [^c8329ce9].

> Wait, let me verify the clinical applicability in atrial fibrillation. Dabigatran is FDA-approved to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, which fits this patient's indication precisely, whereas the other options either do not directly inhibit thrombin or are not the best mechanistic match for the question asked [^c8329ce9] [^cdba2f76].

> Hold on, I should double-check the distractors to ensure I'm not missing a nuance. While heparin can inhibit thrombin, it does so indirectly via antithrombin, so it does not meet the "directly inhibits thrombin" requirement; similarly, warfarin reduces thrombin generation indirectly by lowering factor II levels, and aspirin works on platelets rather than thrombin itself, reinforcing that dabigatran is the only correct choice among the listed options [^b203f8ee] [^903af159].

> Final answer: B. Dabigatran, because it is the only direct thrombin inhibitor among the choices and is indicated for stroke prevention in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation [^c8329ce9] [^d0431501].

---

The correct answer is **B. Dabigatran** because it is the only oral, direct thrombin inhibitor approved for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation. Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent, heparin is an indirect thrombin inhibitor requiring antithrombin III, and warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist that reduces thrombin indirectly by lowering factor II levels.

---

## Mechanism of action of dabigatran

Dabigatran is a **direct thrombin inhibitor** that binds reversibly to the active site of thrombin, blocking fibrin formation and thrombin-induced platelet activation [^d0431501]. It inhibits both free and clot-bound thrombin, providing predictable anticoagulation without routine lab monitoring [^d0431501].

---

## Comparison with other anticoagulants

| **Drug** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical use** |
|-|-|-|
| Aspirin | Antiplatelet agent; inhibits COX-1 | Not for AF stroke prevention |
| Heparin | Indirect thrombin inhibitor; requires antithrombin III | Parenteral; short-term use |
| Warfarin | Vitamin K antagonist; reduces factors II, VII, IX, X | Requires INR monitoring |
| Dabigatran | Direct thrombin inhibitor | Oral; no routine monitoring |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines recommend dabigatran as a **first-line alternative to warfarin** for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation, with favorable efficacy and safety profiles [^cdba2f76] [^67b24ee9].

---

## Conclusion

Dabigatran is the correct choice because it is the **only direct thrombin inhibitor** among the options and is indicated for stroke prevention in non-valvular atrial fibrillation.

### Direct thrombin inhibitors [^5f14a9a1]. Thrombosis Research (2002). Low credibility.

Thrombin plays a central role in thrombosis. Consequently, most current antithrombotic treatment strategies are aimed at blocking the activity of thrombin, or preventing its generation. Although heparin has been a cornerstone of treatment, it has limitations. Thus, the anticoagulant response to heparin is unpredictable, the heparin/antithrombin complex is unable to inhibit fibrin-bound thrombin, an important trigger of thrombus growth, and heparin is neutralized by platelet factor 4. Direct thrombin inhibitors were developed to overcome these limitations. Unlike heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors produce a predictable anticoagulant response that is unaffected by platelet factor 4, and they inhibit fibrin-bound thrombin. Three parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors — hirudin, bivalirudin and argatroban — are currently licensed for use in North America, and orally available direct thrombin inhibitors are under investigation. This review summarizes the clinical trial data with direct thrombin inhibitors and provides perspective on the role of direct thrombin inhibitors in the face of other new anticoagulants currently under development.

### Direct thrombin inhibitors: pharmacology and clinical relevance [^648abe3a]. Anaesthesia (2005). Low credibility.

Although heparin has been a cornerstone of treatment for the prevention of thrombosis, it is limited by its adverse effects and unpredictable bioavailability. Direct thrombin inhibitors are a novel class of drugs that have been developed as an effective alternative mode of anticoagulation in patients who suffer from heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia, and for the management of thromboembolic disorders and acute coronary syndromes. The main disadvantages of the direct thrombin inhibitors are the lack of an antidote or readily available clinical monitoring. The mechanism of action, the properties of direct thrombin inhibitors and their potential to replace currently available anticoagulants are reviewed.

### Structure and specificity in coagulation and its inhibition [^4c08fc4c]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

The coagulation cascade is a complex multiple-component system, whose highly diverse interactions provide a careful balance between procoagulatory and anticoagulatory processes. Recent structural data for thrombin, factor Xa, and antithrombin reveal how these key participants interact with each other and with other components for the maintenance of hemostasis.

### The direct thrombin inhibitors: their role and use for rational anticoagulation [^a00918c2]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Major clinical advantages are achieved when direct thrombin inhibitors are used in venous thromboembolism. These agents provide more reliable anticoagulant response patterns because they are not significantly bound to plasma proteins and few, if any, drug-drug interactions are seen. The studies to date confirm that not all direct thrombin inhibitors are the same. The new reversible, short-acting catalytic site-specific drugs provide an excellent safety profile and high degree of efficacy for the prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolic states. The availability of the oral prodrug ximelagatran allows reproducible, effective, and safe direct thrombin inhibition without the requirement for coagulation laboratory monitoring; it appears destined to be the oral anticoagulant of the future.

### Regulation of thrombin activity – pharmacologic and structural aspects [^00bf1add]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2007). Low credibility.

Thrombin is an essential serine protease for survival. Since the discovery of heparin in the early twentieth century, significant advances have been made in the understanding of thrombin structure and function in coagulation system. Endogenous anticoagulant proteins in blood tightly regulate thrombin generation, but additional anticoagulant agents may be necessary to suppress excessive thrombin formation or defective anticoagulant proteins. Despite the availability of an array of anticoagulant agents based on chemical and biological engineering technologies, anticoagulation therapy remains a challenge for clinicians in terms of balancing bleeding and thrombosis. The aim of this article is to review endogenous serine protease inhibitors and novel antithrombotic agents in relation to pharmacologic regulation of thrombin.

### Direct thrombin inhibitors for anticoagulation [^62d31920]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the progress in developing direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs) for anticoagulation within the context of existing anticoagulation therapies.

Data Sources

Searches of MEDLINE (1993-June 2003) were conducted.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

We examined English-language articles, human studies, and relevant animal studies, and obtained additional citations from the references of these articles.

Data Synthesis

Because of its pivotal role in hemostasis, thrombin is a key therapeutic target in the treatment and prevention of thromboembolic disorders. Conventional anticoagulant therapies, such as warfarin, unfractionated heparin, and low-molecular-weight heparin, exert their pharmacologic action by indirect thrombin inhibition. Although these agents are effective, each has limitations, prompting a search for more effective, specific, better-tolerated, and convenient anticoagulants. The efficacy and safety of factor Xa inhibitors are being investigated. Furthermore, the development of DTIs such as recombinant hirudin (lepirudin), bivalirudin, and argatroban continues. Challenges in the development of DTIs include establishing a binding affinity for thrombin that is not associated with excessive bleeding, attaining high thrombin specificity, achieving inhibition of both unbound and clot-bound thrombin, and producing an effective, fixed-dose oral anticoagulant to improve the practicality of anticoagulation therapy. Ximelagatran, an oral DTI designed to meet these standards, is currently in Phase III clinical trials.

Conclusions

Significant progress has been made in developing DTIs. The recent emergence of orally administered DTIs may simplify the prevention and treatment of thrombosis.

### Inhibition of coagulation by macromolecular complexes [^4c56e292]. Haematologica (2005). Low credibility.

The role of vertebrate blood coagulation is to rapidly prevent the loss of body fluids following vascular injury without compromising blood flow through either the uninjured or damaged vessels. To achieve this the coagulation network is initiated and regulated by a complex network of interactions that are under the control of both positive and negative feedback loops that result in controlled fibrin deposition and platelet activation only at the site of injury. Anticoagulant molecules play key roles in preventing inappropriate initiation of coagulation as well as down-regulating thrombin generation at the site of injury. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) inhibits the initiation complex, antithrombin (AT) inhibits the active serine proteases directly, whereas the activated protein C pathway inhibits coagulation by inactivating the cofactors V and VIII. In this review the structure and function of these anticoagulant molecules and their inhibitory complexes is discussed.

### Argatroban [^ff4ac5c2]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor that reversibly binds to the thrombin active site. Argatroban does not require the co-factor anti-thrombin III for antithrombotic activity. Argatroban exerts its anticoagulant effects by inhibiting thrombin-catalyzed or -induced reactions, including fibrin formation; activation of coagulation factors V, VIII, and XIII; activation of protein C; and platelet aggregation.

Argatroban inhibits thrombin with an inhibition constant (Ki) of 0.04 μM. At therapeutic concentrations, argatroban has little or no effect on related serine proteases (trypsin, factor Xa, plasmin, and kallikrein).

Argatroban is capable of inhibiting the action of both free and clot-associated thrombin.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

When argatroban is administered by continuous infusion, anticoagulant effects and plasma concentrations of argatroban follow similar, predictable temporal response profiles, with low intersubject variability. Immediately upon initiation of argatroban infusion, anticoagulant effects are produced as plasma argatroban concentrations begin to rise. Steady-state levels of both drug and anticoagulant effect are typically attained within 1 to 3 hours and are maintained until the infusion is discontinued or the dosage adjusted. Steady-state plasma argatroban concentrations increase proportionally with dose (for infusion doses up to 40 mcg/kg/min in healthy subjects) and are well correlated with steady-state anticoagulant effects. For infusion doses up to 40 mcg/kg/min, argatroban increases in a dose-dependent fashion, the aPTT, ACT, the prothrombin time (PT), the International Normalized Ratio (INR), and the thrombin time (TT) in healthy volunteers and cardiac patients. Representative steady-state plasma argatroban concentrations and anticoagulant effects are shown below for argatroban infusion doses up to 10 mcg/kg/min (see Figure 1).

### Exosite crosstalk in thrombin [^74dfe55d]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2025). Medium credibility.

Thrombin is the central mediator of hemostasis, where it converts fibrinogen to fibrin, activates upstream factors to promote coagulation, activates factor XIII and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor to stabilize fibrin, mediates anticoagulation, and modulates cellular activity via cell surface receptors. Thus, regulation of thrombin activity is essential to the hemostatic balance. Thrombin is regulated by positively charged surface domains that surround the active site. These exosites bind substrates, inhibitors, cofactors, and receptors, which coordinate to direct thrombin to the appropriate location and modulate catalytic activity. Thus, the exosites are essential to the activity and regulation of thrombin. In addition to acting as binding sites, the exosites modulate the active site allosterically. Furthermore, the exosites impact each other, whereby the binding of ligands to one exosite impacts the function of the opposing exosite. Given the integral role that exosites play in the regulation of thrombin, they are attractive targets for the regulation of thrombin and for the development of new anticoagulants.

### Predicting the pharmacology of thrombin inhibitors [^e0fa3ee1]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2003). Low credibility.

Thrombotic disorders can lead to uncontrolled thrombin generation and clot formation within the circulatory system leading to vascular thrombosis. Direct inhibitors of thrombin have been developed and tested in clinical trials for the treatment of a variety of these thrombotic disorders. The bleeding complications observed during these trials have raised questions about their clinical use. The development of a computer-based model of coagulation using the kinetic rates of individual reactions and concentrations of the constituents involved in each reaction within blood has made it possible to study coagulation pathologies in silico. We present an extension of our initial model of coagulation to include several specific thrombin inhibitors. Using this model we have studied the effect of a variety of inhibitors on thrombin generation and compared these results with the clinically observed data. The data suggest that numerical models will be useful in predicting the effectiveness of inhibitors of coagulation.

### Oral anticoagulant therapy: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^d0431501]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Direct thrombin inhibitors — dabigatran etexilate pharmacology — do not require a cofactor and can access clot-bound thrombin, with dabigatran being a concentration dependent, competitive, highly selective and reversible direct thrombin inhibitor with a Ki of 4.5 ± 0.2 μM; on conversion from its prodrug, dabigatran prolongs thrombin clotting time (TCT), PT, aPTT, and ecarin clotting time (ECT), and ECT has been a preferred measure for direct thrombin inhibitors. Dabigatran prevents thrombin-induced platelet aggregation but not aggregation by arachidonic acid, collagen, or adenosine diphosphate; in animal models, thrombus inhibition peaks within 30 to 60 min of an oral dose, persists for 2 to 3 h in rats and about 7 h in rabbits, and in rats the intravenous dose required to prolong tail bleeding time is 5 to 10 times greater than the maximally effective antithrombotic dose of 0.1 mg/kg.

### The mechanism of action of rivaroxaban – an oral, direct factor Xa inhibitor – compared with other anticoagulants [^45b39522]. Thrombosis Research (2011). Low credibility.

Although results of some phase III clinical trials of new oral anticoagulants are now known, it is important to understand the mechanisms of their actions. These new agents exert their anticoagulant effect via direct inhibition of a single Factor within the coagulation cascade (such as Factor Xa or thrombin). Rivaroxaban — the first oral, direct Factor Xa inhibitor — is a small-molecule oxazolidinone derivative that binds directly and reversibly to Factor Xa via the S1 and S4 pockets. Rivaroxaban competitively inhibits Factor Xa and is more than 10,000-fold more selective for Factor Xa than other related serine proteases, and it does not require cofactors (such as antithrombin) to exert its anticoagulant effect. Unlike indirect Factor Xa inhibitors, rivaroxaban inhibits both free and clot-bound Factor Xa, as well as prothrombinase activity, thereby prolonging clotting times. Dabigatran etexilate is a direct thrombin inhibitor that inhibits both free and fibrin-bound thrombin. Although the mechanism of action differs between the direct Factor Xa and direct thrombin inhibitors, phase III studies of these new agents confirmed that both Factor Xa and thrombin are viable anticoagulation targets.

### Bivalirudin [^0b005938]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Bivalirudin directly inhibits thrombin by specifically binding both to the catalytic site and to the anion-binding exosite of circulating and clot-bound thrombin. Thrombin is a serine proteinase that plays a central role in the thrombotic process, acting to cleave fibrinogen into fibrin monomers and to activate Factor XIII to Factor XIIIa, allowing fibrin to develop a covalently cross-linked framework, which stabilizes the thrombus; thrombin also activates Factors V and VIII, promoting further thrombin generation, and activates platelets, stimulating aggregation and granule release. The binding of bivalirudin to thrombin is reversible as thrombin slowly cleaves the bivalirudin-Arg3-Pro4bond, resulting in recovery of thrombin active site functions.

In in vitro studies, bivalirudin inhibited both soluble (free) and clot-bound thrombin, was not neutralized by products of the platelet release reaction, and prolonged the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), thrombin time (TT), and prothrombin time (PT) of normal human plasma in a concentration-dependent manner. The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

In healthy volunteers and patients (with ≥ 70% vessel occlusion undergoing routine PTCA), bivalirudin exhibited dose- and concentration-dependent anticoagulant activity as evidenced by prolongation of the ACT, aPTT, PT, and TT. Intravenous administration of bivalirudin produces an immediate anticoagulant effect. Coagulation times return to baseline approximately 1 hour following cessation of bivalirudin administration. Bivalirudin also increases INR. Therefore, INR measurements made in bivalirudin treated patients may not be useful for determining the appropriate dose of warfarin.

In 291 patients with ≥ 70% vessel occlusion undergoing routine PTCA, a positive correlation was observed between the dose of bivalirudin and the proportion of patients achieving ACT values of 300 sec or 350 sec. At a bivalirudin dose of 1 mg/kg IV bolus plus 2.5 mg/kg/h IV infusion for 4 hours, followed by 0.2 mg/kg/h, all patients reached maximal ACT values greater than 300 sec.

### Factor XI inhibitors: a new class of anticoagulants [^be368aaa]. Blood Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Concept

Inhibiting the activation of factor XI (FXI) or its active form (FXIa) may offer similar protection as current anticoagulant therapies but with less bleeding. Blocking the contact pathway of thrombin generation by inhibiting FXI/FXIa, typically activated by blood contact with artificial surfaces or inflammatory mediators (contact activation initiated), may allow for sufficient generation of thrombin by the tissue factor/FVII pathway, usually activated by trauma, to prevent bleeding (tissue factor initiated; figure).

FXI/FXIa inhibition may allow for inhibition of contact pathway activation of thrombin generation depicted on the right side of the coagulation cascade, while allowing for tissue factor mediated activation of thrombin as seen on the left side, thus preventing thrombosis mediated by pathologic activation of thrombin by devices and inflammatory activators of coagulation while preserving hemostasis in the setting of trauma.

### Early versus delayed anticoagulation treatment for people with non-valvular atrial fibrillation-related acute ischaemic stroke [^cdc4e462]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

NOACs directly inhibit thrombin (dabigatran) or indirectly inhibit activated factor X (Xa) (rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban) to prevent blood clot formation. Dabigatran, the first approved NOAC, exerts its anticoagulant effect by strongly, reversibly, and selectively inhibiting thrombin activity, with the intensity of its effects dependent on drug concentration. Rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban inhibit various states of factor Xa to reduce thrombin generation without interfering with existing thrombi, while having minimal impact on normal physiological haemostasis and non‐coagulation functions. Multiple guidelines recommend the use of NOACs for secondary prevention of non‐valvular atrial fibrillation‐related stroke. The advantages of NOACs include minimal interactions with food and drugs, stable pharmacokinetics, no need for dose adjustments, no requirement for regular INR monitoring, rapid onset of action, good tolerability, and fewer side effects compared to warfarin. Compared to warfarin, NOACs have a lower incidence of major bleeding, particularly intracranial haemorrhage, making them generally safer and more convenient. Reversal agents for NOACs, such as idarucizumab and exanetalfa, have been developed for the treatment of life‐threatening bleeding or in situations requiring urgent surgery. Some disadvantages of using NOACs, as opposed to vitamin K antagonists, include higher costs and the need for dose adjustments in individuals with renal impairment or extreme body weight.

Why it is important to do this review

The optimal timing for initiating oral anticoagulant therapy in people with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation‐related stroke remains uncertain, leading to ongoing debate about early versus late initiation. Current guidelines lack consistency and clear recommendations on when to initiate anticoagulant therapy, primarily relying on expert consensus and limited evidence. For example, the 2018 European Heart Rhythm Association practical guideline suggests using the "1‐3‐6‐12" rule based on stroke severity to determine the optimal timing for initiating anticoagulant therapy. The American Heart Association/American Stroke Association recommends initiating oral anticoagulant therapy between 4 and 14 days after symptom onset. Due to the inconsistent recommendations among various guidelines, physicians encounter challenges in determining the optimal timing for initiating anticoagulant therapy for people with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation‐related strokes. A survey conducted among stroke physicians in the UK revealed a lack of consensus on this matter, with 95% of respondents expressing uncertainty about the appropriate time to begin oral anticoagulation. Therefore, a systematic review of the optimal timing for starting oral anticoagulation therapy after acute ischaemic stroke in people with non‐valvular atrial fibrillation is highly warranted.

### Parenteral anticoagulants: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^71c8ca6d]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Parenteral anticoagulants — current agents, mechanisms, and administration are outlined as follows: Indirect anticoagulants in current use include unfractionated heparin (UFH), low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs), fondaparinux, and danaparoid, and direct agents include the thrombin inhibitors hirudin, bivalirudin, and argatroban. UFH binds to antithrombin via a unique pentasaccharide sequence and catalyzes the inactivation of thrombin, factor Xa, and other clotting enzymes, and heparin also binds to cells and plasma proteins other than antithrombin causing unpredictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and triggering nonhemorrhagic side effects, such as heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and osteoporosis. LMWHs have greater inhibitory activity against factor Xa than thrombin and exhibit less binding to cells and plasma proteins than heparin, with more predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties, a longer half-life than heparin, and a lower risk of nonhemorrhagic side effects; LMWHs can be administered once daily or bid by subcutaneous injection, without coagulation monitoring, and based on their greater convenience have replaced UFH for many clinical indications. Fondaparinux, a synthetic pentasaccharide, catalyzes inhibition of factor Xa but not thrombin in an antithrombin-dependent fashion, binds only to antithrombin, and fondaparinux-associated HIT or osteoporosis is unlikely to occur; it exhibits complete bioavailability when administered subcutaneously, has a longer half-life than LMWHs, and is given once daily by subcutaneous injection in fixed doses, without coagulation monitoring. Three additional parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors and danaparoid are approved as alternatives to heparin in patients with HIT.

### A rapid pro-hemostatic approach to overcome direct oral anticoagulants [^ecfd7c54]. Nature Medicine (2016). Excellent credibility.

Direct inhibitors of coagulation factor Xa (FXa) or thrombin are promising oral anticoagulants that are becoming widely adopted. The ability to reverse their anticoagulant effects is important when serious bleeding occurs or urgent medical procedures are needed. Here, using experimental mouse models of hemostasis, we show that a variant coagulation factor, FXa(I16L), rapidly restores hemostasis in the presence of the anticoagulant effects of these inhibitors. The ability of FXa(I16L) to reverse the anticoagulant effects of FXa inhibitor depends, at least in part, on the ability of the active site inhibitor to hinder antithrombin-dependent FXa inactivation, paradoxically allowing uninhibited FXa to persist in plasma. Because of its inherent catalytic activity, FXa(I16L) is more potent (by > 50-fold) in the hemostasis models tested than a noncatalytic antidote that is currently in clinical development. FXa(I16L) also reduces the anticoagulant-associated bleeding in vivo that is induced by the thrombin inhibitor dabigatran. FXa(I16L) may be able to fill an important unmet clinical need for a rapid, pro-hemostatic agent to reverse the effects of several new anticoagulants.

### VE-1902 – A direct thrombin inhibitor with reversible covalent mechanism of action shows efficacy with reduced bleeding in rodent models of thrombosis [^182ad815]. Thrombosis Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

High incidence of bleeding events remains a key risk for patients taking anticoagulants, especially those in need of long-term combination therapy with antiplatelet agents. As a consequence, patients may not receive clinically indicated combination antithrombotic therapy. Here, we report on VE-1902, a member of a novel class of precision oral anticoagulants (PROACs) that combines effective anticoagulation with reduced bleeding in preclinical testing.

Methods and Results

Acting through covalent, reversible active-site modification of thrombin similar to a previously described molecule [1], VE-1902 shows potency and selectivity for thrombin inhibition in human plasma comparable to clinically relevant direct thrombin inhibitors (DTI) such as argatroban and dabigatran (thrombin generation assay ETP EC₅₀ = 1.3 μM compared to 0.36 μM and 0.31 μM for argatroban and dabigatran; > 100-fold selectivity against related serine proteases). Unlike the current anticoagulants, VE-1902 does not significantly inhibit thrombin-mediated platelet activation in in vivo models of thrombosis. In the thrombin generation assay, the compound inhibits thrombin formation without significantly delaying the initiation phase of the clotting cascade. These features are possibly responsible for the observed reduced bleeding in tail bleeding and saphenous vein bleeding models. Consistent with this novel pharmacological profile, VE-1902 shows efficacious anticoagulation in several fibrin-driven animal models of thrombosis (arteriovenous shunt, venous stasis thrombosis, and thrombin-induced thromboembolism models), whereas it does not significantly prevent arterial occlusion in the platelet dependent FeCl 3 model.

Conclusions

By leaving platelet activation following vascular injury mostly unaffected, VE-1902, and the PROACs more generally, represent a new generation of precision anticoagulants with reduced bleeding risk.

### Thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor and an antifibrinolytic pathway [^b2fac260]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2000). Low credibility.

Coagulation and fibrinolysis are processes that form and dissolve fibrin, respectively. These processes are exquisitely regulated and protect the organism from excessive blood loss or excessive fibrin deposition. Regulation of these cascades is accomplished by a variety of mechanisms involving cellular responses, flow, and protein-protein interactions. With respect to regulation mediated by protein-protein interaction, the coagulation cascade appears to be more complex than the fibrinolytic cascade because it has more components. Yet each cascade is regulated by initiators, cofactors, feedback reactions, and inhibitors. Coagulation is also controlled by an anticoagulant pathway composed of (minimally) thrombin, thrombomodulin, and protein C.(1) Protein C is converted by the thrombin/thrombomodulin complex to activated protein C (APC), which catalyzes the proteolytic inactivation of the essential cofactors required for thrombin formation, factors Va and VIIIa. An analogous antifibrinolytic pathway has been identified recently. This pathway provides an apparent symmetry between coagulation and fibrinolysis and is also composed of thrombin, thrombomodulin, and a zymogen that is activated to an enzyme. The enzyme proteolytically inactivates a cofactor to attenuate fibrinolysis. However, unlike APC, which is a serine protease, the antifibrinolytic enzyme is a metalloprotease that exhibits carboxypeptidase B-like activity. Within a few years of each other, 5 groups independently described a molecule that accounts for this antifibrinolytic activity. We refer to this molecule as thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), a name that is based on functional properties by which it was identified, assayed, and purified. (Because of the preferences of some journals "activatable" is occasionally referred to as "activable".) This review will encompass a historical account of efforts to isolate TAFI and characterize it with respect to its activation, activity, regulation, and potential function in vivo.

### Parenteral anticoagulants: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^b203f8ee]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Heparin — structure and mechanism of action are described, noting that it is a highly sulfated mucopolysaccharide that is heterogeneous in molecular size, anticoagulant activity, and pharmacokinetics; heparin molecules range in molecular weight from 3,000 to 30,000 kDa with a mean of 15,000, corresponding to approximately 45 saccharide units. Only about one-third of molecules possess the unique pentasaccharide sequence responsible for most anticoagulant effect. Heparin chains consisting of < 18 saccharide units are too short to bridge antithrombin (AT) to thrombin; however, short chains can catalyze inhibition of factor Xa by AT. The heparin/AT complex inactivates thrombin (factor IIa) and factors Xa, IXa, XIa, and XIIa, and by inactivating thrombin or attenuating its generation heparin prevents fibrin formation and inhibits thrombin-induced activation of platelets and factors V, VIII, and XI. At even higher concentrations, low-affinity heparin impairs factor Xa generation through AT- and HCII-independent mechanisms.

### Structure-function of anticoagulant TIX-5, the inhibitor of factor Xa-mediated FV activation [^f4547472]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

The blood coagulation cascade is characterized by a series of enzymatic reactions that result in the thrombin‐dependent conversion of soluble fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin fibers. The fibrin fibers are pivotal to stabilizing the initial hemostatic platelet plug formed in a blood vessel lesion that prevents bleeding, but also underlies thrombus formation and potential subsequent ischemia associated with a myriad of pathophysiological processes. Thrombin generation proceeds by the successive activation of various coagulation factors, either by the tissue factor (TF)‐dependent extrinsic, or factor XII (FXII)‐dependent intrinsic pathway. Both pathways culminate in the generation of activated factor X (FXa), with the latter being capable of proteolytic activation of the zymogen prothrombin (FII) into the serine protease thrombin (FIIa). Because FXa is an inefficient enzyme by itself, interaction with its cofactor activated factor V (FVa) on a negatively charged phospholipid layer in the presence of calcium ions to form the prothrombinase complexallows for the efficient and physiologically relevant conversion of prothrombin to thrombin. The cofactor FVa is generated following cleavage at Arg708, Arg1018, and Arg1545 to remove the central B‐domain that separates the heavy (a.a. 1–708) and light (a.a. 1546–2145) chains of the procofactor FV. Structurally, the central B‐domain appears to cover the FXa binding site of FV by cooperation of acidic (a.a. 1493–1537) and basic (a.a. 963–1008) autoinhibitory sequences guarding the procofactor state of FV. Although both FXa and thrombin are known to be capable of activating purified FV, trace amounts of thrombin formed by FXa alone during the initiation of coagulation have long been recognized as the primary activator of FV. However, we recently challenged this paradigm and demonstrated that FXa‐dependent activation of FV is a crucial event in the initiation of blood coagulation.

Parenteral anticoagulants

Unfractionated heparin

Heparin is an endogenously produced highly sulphated linear glycosaminoglycan (mucopolysaccharide). Clinically used UFH is derived from porcine or bovine mucosa, and is heterogeneous with respect to molecular size, pharmacokinetics and anticoagulant activity. The mean molecular weight of UFH molecules is 15,000 Da (Table 3), corresponding to approximately 45 saccharide units, although UFH molecules range from 3000 to 30,000 Da. A unique pentasaccharide sequence enables high-affinity binding of antithrombin (AT) to heparin molecules, converting AT from a slow into a rapid serine protease inhibitor. However, this pentasaccharide sequence is only present in a third of UFH molecules, and heparin molecules lacking this sequence have reduced anticoagulant activity at therapeutic levels. The heparin/AT complex inactivates the main recognised physiological targets of AT: thrombin (factor IIa) and factor Xa (Fig. 2). Inhibition of thrombin requires formation of a ternary heparin/AT/thrombin complex; heparin chains less than approximately 18 saccharide units are not long enough to bridge AT to thrombin, and so have little anti-IIa activity. However, anti-Xa activity only requires heparin to bind to AT, and so shorter heparin molecules that contain the pentasaccharide sequence still catalyse factor Xa inhibition. UFH also has additional mechanisms of action, detected in in vitro studies, including AT-dependent inhibition of factors IXa, XIa and XIIa, and at high concentrations pentasaccharide sequence-independent heparin cofactor II (HCII)-dependent inhibition of factor IIa.

### Large inter-individual variation of the pharmacodynamic effect of anticoagulant drugs on thrombin generation [^282e23a3]. Haematologica (2013). Low credibility.

Anticoagulation by a standard dosage of an inhibitor of thrombin generation presupposes predictable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the anticoagulant. We determined the inter-individual variation of the effect on thrombin generation of a fixed concentration of direct and antithrombin-mediated inhibitors of thrombin and factor Xa. Thrombin generation was determined by calibrated automated thrombinography in platelet-poor plasma from 44 apparently healthy subjects which was spiked with fixed concentrations of otamixaban, melagatran, unfractionated heparin, dermatan sulfate and pentasaccharide. The variability of the inhibitory effect of the different anticoagulants within the population was determined using the coefficient of variation, i.e. the standard deviation expressed as a percentage of the mean. The inter-individual coefficients of variation of the endogenous thrombin potential and peak height before inhibition were 18% and 16%, respectively and became 20%-24% and 24%-43% after inhibition. The average inhibition of endogenous thrombin potential and peak height (ETP, peak) brought about by the anticoagulants was respectively: otamixaban (27%, 83%), melagatran (56%, 63%), unfractionated heparin (43%, 58%), dermatan sulfate (68%, 57%) and pentasaccharide (25%, 67%). This study demonstrates that the addition of a fixed concentration of any type of anticoagulant tested causes an inhibition that is highly variable from one individual to another. In this respect there is no difference between direct inhibitors of thrombin and factor Xa and heparin(-like) inhibitors acting on the same factors.

### New anticoagulant drugs for treatment of venous thromboembolism and stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation [^732e1688]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (including deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) and atrial fibrillation are common conditions in Western countries. The mainstay of treatment and prevention for these diseases is fast-acting anticoagulant drugs such as heparins and vitamin K antagonists. The use of these drugs is, however, complex and demanding for both patients and physicians. Recently, new antithrombotic drugs that act directly by inhibiting activated coagulation factors such as factor X or thrombin have been developed and investigated in phase III clinical trials. The aim of this article is to review: (i) the need to develop new drugs; (ii) their efficacy/safety as demonstrated in clinical trials; (iii) the need for laboratory monitoring and (iv) the direction towards the use of these new drugs in the real-life clinical situation.

Currently available anticoagulants are limited by modest therapeutic benefits, narrow clinical applications, increased bleeding risk, and drug-induced thrombophilia. Because factor IX plays a pivotal role in tissue factor (TF)-mediated thrombin generation, it may represent a promising target for drug development. Several methods of attenuating factor IX activity, including monoclonal antibodies, synthetic active site-blocked competitive inhibitors, oral inhibitors, and RNA aptamers, have undergone investigation. This review summarizes present knowledge of factor IX inhibitors with emphasis on biology, pharmacology, preclinical data, and early-phase clinical experience in humans.

### Thrombogenic potential of picomolar coagulation factor XIa is mediated by thrombin wave propagation [^cddfd968]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

The reasons for the strong anticoagulant effect of anti-FXIa therapies may be as complex as the potential involvement of FXI in thrombosis. FXIa inhibitors can block FXI activation mediated by thrombin, FXIIa, and FXIa itself (via autoactivation), which are thought to promote TG inside the thrombus. Another antithrombotic target of anti-FXIa therapies is circulating FXIa, which is associated with past thrombotic events. Our in vitro studies indicate that circulating FXIa is a thrombogenic risk that supersedes that of FXIa produced inside the clot. Therefore, we suggest that during the clinical development of anti-FXIa therapies, researchers should consider measuring FXIa activity levels in patients before and after therapy administration. It is plausible that a test for circulating FXIa could identify patients who are most likely to benefit from anti-FXIa therapy and determine the optimal dose for them.

Mechanism of action of dabigatran

Dabigatran is a small molecule that binds competitively and selectively to the catalytic site of thrombin. Since thrombin facilitates coagulation by converting fibrinogen into a fibrin network, dabigatran has the effect of blocking the terminal coagulation cascade (Fig. 1). Additional effects of thrombin prevented by dabigatran include platelet activation, amplification of coagulation activation (positive feedback mechanism) and inhibition of fibrinolysis.

### Heparin chain-length dependence of factor Xa inhibition by antithrombin in plasma [^e5918c50]. Thrombosis Research (2007). Low credibility.

Heparin anticoagulants function by enhancing the inhibition of coagulation proteases by the serpin antithrombin (AT). A direct evaluation of the specific anti-factor Xa (fXa) activity of therapeutic heparins in the physiologically relevant plasma-based clotting assays has not been feasible since thrombin, the final protease of the cascade, is the primary target for inhibition by AT in the presence of heparin. To circumvent this problem, we developed an assay in which the native AT in plasma was replaced with an AT mutant which exhibits identical affinity for heparin and near normal reactivity for fXa, but does not react with thrombin and other coagulation proteases in either the absence or presence of heparin. This assay was used to distinguish the anti-fXa activity of different molecular weight heparins from their anti-thrombin activity in clotting assays which were initiated by the triggers of either the extrinsic or intrinsic coagulation pathway. The results suggest that the acceleration of fXa inhibition by AT exhibits a marked heparin chain-length dependence, with fondaparinux (a pentasaccharide) having the lowest and unfractionated heparin having the highest effect. Interestingly, comparative studies revealed that the fondaparinux-catalyzed acceleration of thrombin inhibition by AT also contributes to the prolongation of the clotting time, possibly suggesting that the anticoagulant function of the therapeutic pentasaccharide is mediated though the inhibition of both fXa and thrombin.

### Thrombin and factor Xa link the coagulation system with liver fibrosis [^99f7533a]. BMC Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary the results generated by this study further support the role of coagulation proteins in the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrogenesis. We have demonstrated that FXa and thrombin both independently and in synergy promote hepatic stellate cell activation and early inhibition of coagulation using an FXa inhibitor significantly reduced the rate of hepatic fibrosis and stellate cell activity in a mouse model of liver fibrosis compared to direct thrombin inhibition. This effect is likely due to the failure of direct thrombin inhibition to block PAR-mediated stellate cell activation by FXa, and highlights the importance of inhibiting the coagulation cascade earlier when planning anti-fibrotic therapies. A UK based phase II study examining the effects of anticoagulation in liver fibrosis in patients post liver transplant infected with HCV is currently being undertaken to further evaluate the anti-fibrotic potential of anticoagulation in liver disease (ISRCTN 12504151). In view of our findings and recent trials demonstrating the safety of FXa inhibitors, consideration should be given to trials using these new agents as potential anti-fibrotics which, unlike warfarin, do not require frequent monitoring.

### Parenteral anticoagulants: antithrombotic therapy and prevention of thrombosis, 9th ed: American College of Chest Physicians evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^45da7870]. Chest (2012). Medium credibility.

Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) anti-Xa/anti-IIa activity and chain-length dependence — only pentasaccharide-containing chains composed of at least 18 saccharide units can bridge antithrombin (AT) to thrombin, leaving 50% to 75% of LMWH chains too short to catalyze thrombin inhibition, and the pentasaccharide sequence required for binding is found on fewer than one-third of LMWH molecules. Accordingly, heparin has an anti-Xa to anti-IIa ratio of 1:1, whereas commercial LMWHs have anti-Xa to anti-IIa ratios between 2:1 and 4:1; at present, there is no evidence that the differences in anti-Xa to anti-IIa ratio among the LMWHs influence clinical outcomes such as recurrent thrombosis or bleeding complications.

### Engineered factor Xa variants retain procoagulant activity independent of direct factor Xa inhibitors [^7da4204c]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Active site inhibition of procoagulant serine proteases including FXa has been the focus of anticoagulant drug discovery for over a decade. This has led to the clinical approval of several orally active, synthetic inhibitors of FXa for the prophylactic management of stroke in atrial fibrillation and prevention and treatment of venous thrombosis. These so-called direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) currently include the direct FXa inhibitors rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. By reversibly engaging the active site of FXa with high affinity, the small molecules effectively block the catalytic activity of both free and prothrombinase-assembled FXa. However, a major drawback to their use is the absence of an adequate reversal strategy to prevent and stop potential life-threatening bleeding complications associated with anticoagulant therapy. Here we present human FXa variants that display a reduced sensitivity to inhibition by the direct FXa inhibitors due to modifications in the active site region, which are based on exceptional structural adaptations found in FX variants that are expressed in the venom of specific Elapid snakes. Using a combined computational and biochemistry approach, we have uncovered the mechanistic basis of the FXa inhibitor-sensitivity of these variants and demonstrate their effectiveness as potential bypassing agents in plasma containing direct FXa inhibitors.

Differentiating thrombosis from hemostasis

The unique characteristics of FXI deficiency highlight the potential for targeting FXI in antithrombotic therapy, as patients often have extended clotting times without a severe bleeding tendency and show a reduced risk of certain thrombotic events.

Thrombosis and hemostasis, while sharing enzymatic pathways, result in divergent physiological outcomes. Hemostasis, a natural response to vascular injury, results in the formation of a localized hemostatic plug to halt bleeding. Thrombosis, typically pathological, is characterized by the formation of intravascular thrombi that can interrupt blood flow and potentially lead to organ damage. Differentiating thrombosis from hemostasis is vital for the development of antithrombotic agents that prevent thrombosis without adversely affecting hemostasis, making the contact pathway a promising target for safer anticoagulants. Given its specific role in thrombosis without a significant impact on hemostasis, inhibition of upstream factors in this pathway can potentially decouple thrombosis from hemostasis, offering a promising strategy to reduce the risk of anticoagulant-related bleeding. This approach is particularly advantageous as it focuses on a single pathway rather than affecting multiple coagulation factors or engaging with the tissue factor/factor VII and common pathways (Figure 1). It potentially offers a safer alternative to currently available anticoagulants, which directly affect fibrin formation; however, while the involvement of the contact pathway in pathological thrombosis presents a compelling target for intervention, the redundancy and compensatory mechanisms within the coagulation system may pose challenges to the efficacy of targeting this pathway alone.

### Apixaban [^5a463851]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Apixaban is a selective inhibitor of FXa. It does not require antithrombin III for antithrombotic activity. Apixaban inhibits free and clot-bound FXa, and prothrombinase activity. Apixaban has no direct effect on platelet aggregation, but indirectly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by thrombin. By inhibiting FXa, apixaban decreases thrombin generation and thrombus development.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

As a result of FXa inhibition, apixaban prolongs clotting tests such as prothrombin time (PT), INR, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Changes observed in these clotting tests at the expected therapeutic dose, however, are small, subject to a high degree of variability, and not useful in monitoring the anticoagulation effect of apixaban.

The Rotachrom®Heparin chromogenic assay was used to measure the effect of apixaban on FXa activity in humans during the apixaban development program. A concentration-dependent increase in anti-FXa activity was observed in the dose range tested and was similar in healthy subjects and patients with AF.

This test is not recommended for assessing the anticoagulant effect of apixaban.

 Effect of PCCs on Pharmacodynamics of Apixaban Tablets

There is no clinical experience to reverse bleeding with the use of 4-factor PCC products in individuals who have received apixaban tablets.

Effects of 4-factor PCCs on the pharmacodynamics of apixaban were studied in healthy subjects. Following administration of apixaban dosed to steady state, endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) returned to pre-apixaban levels 4 hours after the initiation of a 30-minute PCC infusion, compared to 45 hours with placebo. Mean ETP levels continued to increase and exceeded pre-apixaban levels reaching a maximum (34%-51% increase over pre-apixaban levels) at 21 hours after initiating PCC and remained elevated (21%-27% increase) at the end of the study (69 hours after initiation of PCC). The clinical relevance of this increase in ETP is unknown.

### Non-vitamin-K-antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) after acute myocardial infarction: a network meta-analysis [^c802a08d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

These safety and efficacy considerations have led to the exploration of NOACs in secondary prevention after AMI. Studies have found that VKAs alone, or in combination with aspirin, reduce rates of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) but increase the rate of major bleeding, including intracranial haemorrhage (Anand 2003; Andreotti 2006; Hurlen 2002; Rothberg 2005; van Es 2002). The antithrombotic potential of NOACs after AMI in people without an indication for anticoagulation remains unclear.

Several studies have assessed the efficacy of NOACs combined with DAPT after acute coronary syndrome (ACS; Alexander 2009; Gibson 2011; Mega 2012; Oldgren 2011). Dabigatran and apixaban showed no significant clinical benefit in preventing new ischaemic cardiovascular events (Alexander 2009; Oldgren 2011). Moreover, apixaban was prematurely discontinued due to a significant increase in the risk of major bleeding events (Alexander 2011). On the other hand, a very low dose of rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily (BD)) resulted in reduced MACEs after ACS (Gibson 2011; Mega 2012).

How the intervention might work

NOACs inhibit thrombin either directly (dabigatran) or indirectly by inhibiting factor Xa (rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban). AMIs lead to increased thrombin generation, and elevated thrombin concentrations are detectable for at least six months following the acute episode (Merlini 1994). Furthermore, elevated thrombin levels are linked to the recurrence of cardiovascular events. Multiple studies have demonstrated the importance of coagulation's protein arm, represented by the ability to lyse fibrin, in recurrent events following ACS (Farag 2019; Saraf 2010; Sumaya 2018a; Sumaya 2020). These studies indicate a significant role of thrombin generation in arterial thrombosis. NOACs may improve outcomes by limiting arterial thrombosis through their ability to inhibit thrombin formation. Furthermore, anticoagulation promotes fibrin clot lysis (Sumaya 2018a), which enhances reperfusion following a plaque rupture event. Anticoagulants also exert an indirect antiplatelet effect by inhibiting thrombin generation (Sumaya 2018a).

The efficacy of FXa and thrombin inhibition as antifibrotic therapies in vivo

From the pathway described above, we can hypothesize that targeting coagulation proteins earlier in the cascade should enhance the anti-fibrotic effect rather than inhibiting thrombin alone. We sought to study this further by using the oral anticoagulants, Rivaroxaban, a direct FXa inhibitor, and Dabigatran, a direct thrombin antagonist in vivo using mice exposed to 8 weeks of TAA orally to induce liver fibrosis. Preliminary experiments were conducted to adjust the doses in animals to attain the required level of anticoagulation. Tail bleeding was done to ascertain coagulation time to give equivocal prolongation of coagulation time for the doses used. Doses were increased until the same prolongation for both rivaroxaban and dabigatran was achieved. Using this model we have demonstrated a significant reduction in mean percentage area of fibrosis determined by digital image analysis, mean fibrosis scores, αSMA expression and hepatic hydroxyproline content in mice treated with Rivaroxaban, at a dose of 40 mg/kg versus control mice. In contrast, Dabigatran at a dose of 100 mg/kg did not result in a significant reduction in these parameters with the exception of hepatic hydroxyproline, versus control animals and a significantly higher mean percentage area of fibrosis and hepatic hydroxyproline content compared to Rivaroxaban treated mice, despite an equivalent level of anticoagulation. The concordance between our in vitro and in vivo data highlights the particular importance of the coagulation protein FXa, as well as thrombin in hepatic fibrosis. In vivo the administration of the FXa inhibitor, Rivaroxaban, not only inhibits FXa, but will prevent the downstream production of the thrombin 'burst'. Accordingly, the significant reduction in fibrosis and αSMA expression seen in mice exposed to TAA and treated with Rivaroxaban, could be explained by both the direct reduction in FXa mediated PAR1 and PAR2 activation, as well as the indirect reduction in thrombin mediated stellate cell activation via PDGF, TGF-beta and PAR1 ligation. This would also explain why direct thrombin inhibition with Dabigatran was less effective anti-fibrotic intervention compared to FXa inhibition with Rivaroxaban, since inhibition of thrombin alone would fail to block FXa PAR mediated activation of stellate cells and fibrogenesis. Parallels can be drawn with previous unpublished data from our group, in which Ximelagatran, a thrombin antagonist that has now been withdrawn from clinical use, was found to be less effective than warfarin in reducing fibrosis in wild-type C57BL/6 J mice, possibly suggesting that modulation of factors II, VII, IX and X by warfarin provided additional anti-fibrotic effects over direct thrombin (II) blockade alone (Anstee and Thursz, un-published data). Heparin will have a similar effect to FXa inhibitors due to a similar mode of action. Therefore any potential benefits demonstrated with Direct-acting Oral anticoagulants could also be demonstrated with heparin, however further studies are required.

### Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) [^f1b199dd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

XARELTO is a selective inhibitor of FXa. It does not require a cofactor (such as Anti-thrombin III) for activity. Rivaroxaban inhibits free FXa and prothrombinase activity. Rivaroxaban has no direct effect on platelet aggregation, but indirectly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by thrombin. By inhibiting FXa, rivaroxaban decreases thrombin generation.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Rivaroxaban produces dose-dependent inhibition of FXa activity. Clotting tests, such as prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and HepTest®, are also prolonged dose-dependently. In children treated with rivaroxaban, the correlation between anti-factor Xa to plasma concentrations is linear with a slope close to 1.

Monitoring for anticoagulation effect of rivaroxaban using anti-FXa activity or a clotting test is not recommended.

Specific Populations

Renal Impairment

The relationship between systemic exposure and pharmacodynamic activity of rivaroxaban was altered in adult subjects with renal impairment relative to healthy control subjects [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Hepatic Impairment

Anti-Factor Xa activity was similar in adult subjects with normal hepatic function and in mild hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh A class). There is no clear understanding of the impact of hepatic impairment beyond this degree on the coagulation cascade and its relationship to efficacy and safety.

### Apixaban (Eliquis) [^43850fe8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Apixaban is a selective inhibitor of FXa. It does not require antithrombin III for antithrombotic activity. Apixaban inhibits free and clot-bound FXa, and prothrombinase activity. Apixaban has no direct effect on platelet aggregation, but indirectly inhibits platelet aggregation induced by thrombin. By inhibiting FXa, apixaban decreases thrombin generation and thrombus development.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Changes observed in these clotting tests at the expected therapeutic dose, however, are small, subject to a high degree of variability, and not useful in monitoring the anticoagulation effect of apixaban.

The Rotachrom®Heparin chromogenic assay was used to measure the effect of apixaban on FXa activity in humans primarily during the apixaban adult development program. A concentration-dependent increase in anti-FXa activity was observed in the dose range tested and was similar in healthy subjects and patients with AF.

This test is not recommended for assessing the anticoagulant effect of apixaban.

Effect of PCCs on Pharmacodynamics of ELIQUIS

There is no clinical experience to reverse bleeding with the use of 4-factor PCC products in individuals who have received ELIQUIS.

Effects of 4-factor PCCs on the pharmacodynamics of apixaban were studied in healthy subjects. Following administration of apixaban dosed to steady state, endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) returned to pre-apixaban levels 4 hours after the initiation of a 30-minute PCC infusion, compared to 45 hours with placebo. Mean ETP levels continued to increase and exceeded pre-apixaban levels reaching a maximum (34%-51% increase over pre-apixaban levels) at 21 hours after initiating PCC and remained elevated (21%-27% increase) at the end of the study (69 hours after initiation of PCC). The clinical relevance of this increase in ETP is unknown.

Its specific anti-Xa activity is higher than that of LMWH (about 700 units/mg and 100 units/mg, respectively), and its half-life after subcutaneous injection is longer than that of LMWH (17 h and about 4 h, respectively). As a result, fondaparinux levels should only be determined using assays that use known fondaparinux concentrations to generate their standard curve. Mechanistically, fondaparinux binds to AT and produces a conformational change at the reactive site of AT that enhances its reactivity with factor Xa; it then forms a covalent complex with factor Xa, is released from AT, and is available to activate additional AT molecules; because it is too short to bridge AT to thrombin, fondaparinux does not increase the rate of thrombin inhibition by AT. After subcutaneous injection, fondaparinux is rapidly and completely absorbed; a steady state is reached after the third or fourth once-daily dose, and fondaparinux is excreted unchanged in the urine. The terminal half-life is 17 h in young subjects and 21 h in elderly volunteers. Fondaparinux produces a predictable anticoagulant response and exhibits linear pharmacokinetics when given in subcutaneous doses of 2 to 8 mg or in IV doses ranging from 2 to 300 mg. There is minimal nonspecific binding of fondaparinux.

### Major bleeding during oral anticoagulant therapy associated with factor V activation by factor Xa [^48e8fd64]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

ESSENTIALS

Thrombin generation provides important information on coagulation while it is currently not used to predict major bleeding.
TIX‐5, a specific inhibitor of factor V (FV) activation by factor X (FX)a is used to estimate the contribution of this pathway to thrombin generation.
We show that while the contribution of FXa‐mediated activation of FV to plasma thrombin generation varies considerably in the normal population, in patients with major bleeding a marked prolongation in the median thrombin generation lag time in the presence of TIX‐5 is observed.
A greater dependence on FXa‐mediated activation of FV of thrombin generation is associated with increased risk of major bleeding during vitamin K antagonist therapy.

Rivaroxaban — antithrombotic mechanism and kinetic parameters — acts as a competitive inhibitor of factor Xa with a concentration-dependent effect and an inhibitory constant of 0.4 ± 0.02 nM, and has 10,000-fold greater selectivity for factor Xa than for other serine proteases. The onset of action is rapid and reversible, with a kinetic association rate constant of 1.7 × 10⁷ mol/L⁻¹/s⁻¹ and a kinetic dissociation rate constant of 5 × 10⁻³/s⁻¹; inhibitory activity is maintained when factor Xa is complexed with factor Va and Ca²⁺ on a phospholipid membrane (prothrombinase bound) and when factor Xa is bound to the clot. In plasma, endogenous human factor Xa is inhibited to cause dose-dependent prolongation of both the prothrombin time (PT) and the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), with the PT being more sensitive than the aPTT.

### Anticoagulants (thrombin inhibitors) and aspirin synergize with P2Y12 receptor antagonism in thrombosis [^b8af342b]. Circulation (2003). Low credibility.

Background

This study was designed to determine whether (1) P2Y12 antagonism synergizes with other antithrombotics and (2) anticoagulants (thrombin inhibitors) affect the antithrombotic activity elicited by P2Y12 antagonism.

Methods and Results

Thrombosis was achieved by perfusion of human and murine blood through type III collagen-coated capillaries at arterial shear rate. CT50547, a direct-acting P2Y12 antagonist, inhibited thrombosis in PPACK- but not heparin-anticoagulated human blood. In contrast, CT50547 inhibited thrombosis in aspirin-treated individuals independently of the anticoagulant. Thrombin and TXA2 also synergized with P2Y12 in the absence of anticoagulation, because combined treatment of aspirin or C921-78 (a factor Xa inhibitor) with CT50547 or 2-MeSAMP (a P2Y12 antagonist) inhibited the thrombotic process, whereas all treatments failed to inhibit thrombosis when used individually. Synergism was also observed ex vivo when P2Y12-deficient (P2Y12-/-) mice were administered aspirin or coagulation inhibitors (C921-78 and bivalirudin). Finally, using intravital microscopy, we found that both C921-78 and bivalirudin abrogated the thrombotic process in P2Y12 ± mice, whereas each showed only partial efficacy in P2Y12+/+ animals.

Conclusions

Our study indicates that (1) thrombin inhibitors and aspirin have a demonstrable synergy of antithrombotic activity with P2Y12 antagonism and (2) the in vitro analysis of the antithrombotic activity of P2Y12 antagonists is affected by the anticoagulant used for blood collection. This suggests that the antithrombotic potential of P2Y12 antagonists in vitro may be overestimated in anticoagulated samples of blood and best achieved in vivo by the inclusion of aspirin and/or a thrombin inhibitor.

### Andexanet alfa (Andexxa) [^e23c767e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1	Mechanism of Action

Coagulation factor Xa (recombinant), inactivated-zhzo exerts its procoagulant effect by binding and sequestering the FXa inhibitors, rivaroxaban and apixaban. Another observed procoagulant effect of the ANDEXXA protein is its ability to bind to, and inhibit the activity of, Tissue Factor Pathway Inhibitor (TFPI). Inhibition of TFPI activity can increase tissue factor (TF)-initiated thrombin generation.

12.2	Pharmacodynamics

The effects of ANDEXXA can be measured using assays for its anti-FXa activity, free fraction of FXa inhibitor, and thrombin generation. In addition to its ability to sequester the FXa inhibitors, rivaroxaban and apixaban, ANDEXXA has been shown to inhibit TFPI activity.

The dose and dosing regimen of ANDEXXA that are required to reverse anti-FXa activity and to restore thrombin generation were determined in dose-ranging studies on healthy volunteers. Dosing of ANDEXXA, as a bolus followed by a two-hour continuous infusion, resulted in a rapid decrease in anti-FXa activity (within two minutes after the completion of the bolus administration) followed by reduced anti-FXa activity that was maintained throughout the duration of the continuous infusion [see Clinical Studies (14)]. The anti-FXa activity returned to the placebo levels approximately two hours after completion of a bolus or continuous infusion, whereas TFPI activity in plasma returned to the pretreatment levels approximately 96 hours following ANDEXXA administration.

Elevation of TF-initiated thrombin generation above the baseline range (prior to anticoagulation) occurred within two minutes following a bolus administration of ANDEXXA and was maintained throughout the duration of the continuous infusion. The TF-initiated thrombin generation was elevated above placebo for at least 22 hours. The sustained elevation of thrombin generation over the baseline range and the sustained elevation over placebo were not observed in a contact-activated thrombin generation assay (an assay that is not affected by TF-TFPI interaction).

Laboratory assessment of coagulation does not necessarily correlate with or predict the hemostatic effectiveness of ANDEXXA.

12.3	Pharmacokinetics

A summary of the pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of ANDEXXA in healthy patients is shown in the table below (see Table 3).

Drug-Drug Interaction

The pharmacokinetics of ANDEXXA were not affected by apixaban (5 mg orally BID for six days) or rivaroxaban (20 mg orally once daily for six days).

Rivaroxaban — pharmacodynamic effects in healthy subjects and models — In a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study of 12 healthy male subjects aged 27 to 37 years, the prothrombinase-induced clotting time was prolonged dose dependently with a maximum effect after 2 h, and thrombin generation in platelet-rich plasma was markedly reduced with an 80% to 90% decrease (by 5-mg and 30-mg doses, respectively) of the peak collagen-induced endogenous thrombin potential at 2 h. Rivaroxaban has no effects on platelet aggregation induced by collagen, adenosine diphosphate, or thrombin; in venous thrombosis and arteriovenous shunt models it caused dose-dependent reduction of thrombus formation, inhibition of factor Xa activity, and prolongation of the PT.

The anticoagulant effect of thrombin inhibitors is monitored by the aPTT, and is present for 1–3 hours after intravenous administration. Hemorrhagic complications, particularly when combined with thrombolytic or antiplatelet agents, may be life threatening.

### Anticoagulant characteristics of HD1-22, a bivalent aptamer that specifically inhibits thrombin and prothrombinase [^fd62b3fd]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2008). Low credibility.

Background

HD1-22 is a bivalent aptamer that binds to thrombin with high affinity (K(d) = 0.65 nm) and occupies both anion binding exosites without blocking the active centre of the enzyme. HD1-22 has been developed by connecting the exosite 1 binding aptamer HD1 and the exosite 2 binding aptamer HD22 through a poly-dA linker.

Objectives

To characterize the anticoagulant profile of HD1-22 in comparison to the clinically established direct acting thrombin inhibitors bivalirudin and argatroban, and to test the efficacy of antidote-oligodeoxynucleotides.

Methods and Results

HD1-22 prolongs clotting times of the thrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, ecarin clotting time, and lag-time of the tissue factor triggered thrombin generation assay in a dose-dependent manner. On a molar basis, its anticoagulant activity was nearly identical to bivalirudin and superior to argatroban. Thrombin-induced platelet aggregation was more effectively inhibited by HD1-22 than by bivalirudin. The HD1-22 aptamer retains the ability of the HD1-moiety to bind to (pro)exosite 1 of prothrombin and inhibits the prothrombinase activity nearly 2-fold better than HD1. The anticoagulant activities of HD1-22 are fully reversed by addition of antidote-oligodeoxynucleotides.

Conclusions

The strong thrombin-inhibiting activity, together with the availability of a rapid acting antidote strategy, makes HD1-22 an interesting anticoagulant candidate, especially for use in clinical situations where effective anticoagulation and rapid reversal of the anticoagulant effect are required. The data obtained warrant further clinical studies.

### Thrombin in complex with dabigatran can still interact with PAR-1 via exosite-I and instigate loss of vascular integrity [^33f73643]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) can lead to the loss of microvascular integrity thereby enhancing AF progression. Mechanistically, the pro‐coagulant state that drives the risk of stroke in patients with AF may also play a causal role in microvascular loss. Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), the preferred anticoagulants for AF, can target factors upstream (factor Xa [FXa]) or downstream (thrombin) in the coagulation cascade and mediate differential vascular effects through interaction with protease‐activated receptors (PARs).

Objective

To investigate the potential effect of different DOACs on vascular integrity.

Methods

To model the impact of DOACs on vascular integrity, we utilized platelet‐free plasma in thrombin generation assays and endothelial barrier assays under identical experimental conditions. These multifactorial systems provide all coagulation factors and their respective natural inhibitors in physiological ratios in combination with the pro‐coagulant endothelial surface on which coagulation is initiated. Furthermore, the system provides pro‐ and anti‐barrier factors and monitoring both assays simultaneously permits coupling of thrombin kinetics to endothelial barrier dynamics.

Results

We provide evidence that the anti‐FXa DOAC rivaroxaban and the anti‐thrombin DOAC dabigatran are efficient in blocking their target proteases. However, while rivaroxaban could preserve endothelial barrier function, dabigatran failed to protect endothelial integrity over time, which could be prevented in the presence of a custom‐made peptide that blocks thrombin's exosite‐I.

Conclusions

Proteolytically inactive thrombin in complex with dabigatran evokes loss of barrier function that can be prevented by a protease‐activated receptor‐1 mimicking peptide blocking thrombin's exosite‐I.

Atrial Fibrillation

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common dysrhythmia in the United States, with a prevalence that is expected to rise significantly as the population ages. Despite the recognition of several modifiable risk factors for AF, such as obstructive sleep apnea, hypertension, and alcohol use, its prevalence and incidence continue to grow, making it an attractive target for preventive interventions. The preventive approach for AF is 2‐fold: (1) targeting and treating risk factors and (2) promptly diagnosing and initiating antithrombotic therapy to minimize thromboembolic complications.

Although limiting symptoms may significantly affect one's quality of life, the most feared complication associated with AF is stroke or systemic embolism. To this end, selective ECG screening for clinically asymptomatic disease in otherwise healthy persons may be indicated for stroke prevention. In the recently presented STROKESTOP (Population screening of 75‐ and 76‐year‐old men and women for silent atrial fibrillation) trial, population‐based screening of asymptomatic patients in Sweden identified 5% of the population as candidates for oral anticoagulation. The full study is currently under way.

Once AF has been diagnosed, thromboembolic risk assessment should be performed to determine optimal antithrombotic therapy. The 2014 ACC/AHA/Heart Rhythm Society AF guidelines recommend risk stratification using the CHA 2 DS 2 ‐VASc score, which performs better than the CHADS 2 score alone. Although not formally recommended in the guidelines yet, biomarkers, including high‐sensitivity troponin, have been shown to improve risk assessment. Although aspirin and warfarin have been shown to reduce the risk of stroke in AF, – most patients warrant anticoagulant therapy. Until recently, warfarin was the sole anticoagulant approved for AF patients. Novel oral anticoagulants now offer alternatives that do not require prothrombin time monitoring and are associated with superior efficacy and/or safety in nonvalvular AF. – These agents inhibit the coagulation cascade either as a direct thrombin inhibitor (dabigatran) or a factor Xa inhibitor (rivaroxaban, apixaban, or edoxaban, which has not yet received US Food and Drug Administration approval).

### Fondaparinux sodium [^ba1bd352]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

The antithrombotic activity of fondaparinux sodium is the result of antithrombin III (ATIII)-mediated selective inhibition of Factor Xa. By selectively binding to ATIII, fondaparinux sodium potentiates (about 300 times) the innate neutralization of Factor Xa by ATIII. Neutralization of Factor Xa interrupts the blood coagulation cascade and thus inhibits thrombin formation and thrombus development.

Fondaparinux sodium does not inactivate thrombin (activated Factor II) and has no known effect on platelet function. At the recommended dose, fondaparinux sodium does not affect fibrinolytic activity or bleeding time.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Anti-Xa Activity

The pharmacodynamics/pharmacokinetics of fondaparinux sodium are derived from fondaparinux plasma concentrations quantified via anti-Factor Xa activity. Only fondaparinux can be used to calibrate the anti-Xa assay. (The international standards of heparin or LMWH are not appropriate for this use.) As a result, the activity of fondaparinux sodium is expressed as milligrams (mg) of the fondaparinux calibrator. The anti-Xa activity of the drug increases with increasing drug concentration, reaching maximum values in approximately three hours.

Thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFIa) inhibitors — In vitro data indicate TAFIa attenuates fibrinolysis by removing carboxy-terminal lysine residues from fibrin, decreasing plasminogen or plasmin binding; inhibitors of TAFIa therefore have potential to enhance fibrinolysis, supported by animal studies with a potato-derived TAFIa inhibitor that increased plasminogen activator-induced thrombolysis; development efforts include TAFIa-directed antibodies, nanobodies, and small molecules, but a potential limitation is paradoxical enhancement of TAFIa activity at low doses, complicating optimal dosing if common across agents.

### Edoxaban tosylate (Savaysa) [^ca6a89cd]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Edoxaban is a selective inhibitor of FXa. It does not require antithrombin III for antithrombotic activity. Edoxaban inhibits free FXa, and prothrombinase activity and inhibits thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. Inhibition of FXa in the coagulation cascade reduces thrombin generation and reduces thrombus formation.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

As a result of FXa inhibition, edoxaban prolongs clotting time tests such as prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Changes observed in PT, INR, and aPTT at the expected therapeutic dose, however, are small, subject to a high degree of variability and not useful in monitoring the anticoagulant effect of edoxaban. Following oral administration, peak pharmacodynamic effects are observed within 1–2 hours, which correspond with peak edoxaban concentrations (Cmax).

Cardiac Electrophysiology

In a thorough QT study in healthy men and women aged 19–45 years, no QTc interval prolongation was observed with edoxaban (90 mg and 180 mg).

Effect of PCCs on Pharmacodynamics of SAVAYSA

There is no systematic evaluation of bleeding reversal by 4-factor prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC) products in patients who have received SAVAYSA.

Effects of PCC (50 IU/kg) on the pharmacodynamics of edoxaban were studied in healthy subjects following a punch biopsy. Following administration of a single dose of edoxaban, endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) returned to pre-edoxaban baseline levels in 0.5 hours after the initiation of a 15-minute infusion of 50 IU/kg PCC, compared to more than 24 hours with placebo. Mean ETP levels continued to increase and exceeded pre-edoxaban baseline, reaching maximum elevations (~40% over pre-edoxaban levels) at 22 hours after initiating PCC dose, which was the last observation of ETP. The clinical relevance of this ETP increase is unknown.

Pharmacodynamic Interactions

Aspirin

Co-administration of aspirin (100 mg or 325 mg) and edoxaban increased bleeding time relative to that seen with either drug alone.

NSAID (Naproxen)

Co-administration of naproxen (500 mg) and edoxaban increased bleeding time relative to that seen with either drug alone.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Edoxaban displays approximately dose-proportional pharmacokinetics for doses of 15 to 150 mg and 60 to 120 mg following single and repeat doses, respectively, in healthy subjects.

### Being precise with anticoagulation to reduce adverse drug reactions: are we there yet? [^5320fa64]. The Pharmacogenomics Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anticoagulants are a widely prescribed class of drugs used in both medical and surgical settings. In 2015 alone, 14.6 million prescriptions were dispensed in the community in England, the associated cost was over £222 million which represented an increase of £84 million on the previous year.

Oral anticoagulants include indirectly acting coumarin-derived oral anticoagulants, notably warfarin, and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) — dabigatran, apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban. In the UK, ~1.25 million patients receive long term oral anticoagulation, and worldwide warfarin remains the most commonly prescribed oral anticoagulant; however warfarin has now been superseded by apixaban as the most widely prescribed oral anticoagulant in primary care in England. Parenteral anticoagulants include indirect acting unfractionated heparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs), fondaparinux, and the less frequently prescribed direct acting drugs such as bivalirudin and argatroban.

Anticoagulants are primarily indicated in the prophylaxis and treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE), the prophylaxis of systemic (arterial) thromboembolism in predisposing conditions including atrial fibrillation (AF), following a mechanical heart valve implantation, and in constitutive thrombophilic conditions such as antiphospholipid syndrome. Heuristically, parenteral anticoagulants are preferred for short term inpatient anticoagulation, whilst oral anticoagulants are indicated in longer term outpatient anticoagulation.

Clinically, it is evident that patients can respond differently to the same drug. Precision medicine is a therapeutic paradigm that aspires to tailor drug and/or dose selection to specific patient subgroups to enhance drug efficacy and/or minimise harm. There are three main facets to the precise use of therapeutics. First, patients warranting drug intervention need to be identified. For symptomatic conditions patients usually self-present, but asymptomatic conditions require screening. Opportunistic screening for AF for example increases overall AF detection, and the use of novel technologies may further facilitate and improve (paroxysmal) AF screening. Second, optimisation of physician conformity to existing therapeutic guidelines is required. For example, ~50% of patients with AF do not receive anticoagulation and of these patients, 25% have no documented reason, suggesting notable anticoagulant underuse. Further initiatives to understand the barriers limiting guideline adherence are necessary.

### Direct thrombin inhibitors prevent left Atrial remodeling associated with Heart failure in rats [^21dd6d9a]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2016). Low credibility.

Dual antiremodeling and anticoagulant properties of DTIs

In the present study, the anticoagulant activity of DTIs was directly correlated to their plasma concentrations, whereas their antiremodeling effect was maximal between 35 to 100 nmol/l and decreased at higher concentrations. Furthermore, we showed that 10 nmol/l thrombin, a concentration reached during the initiation phase of coagulation cascade, was sufficient to induce hypertrophic genes in atrial myocardium in vitro. Interestingly, maximal inhibition of PAR-1 cleavage is obtained in vitro with 30 to 100 nmol/l dabigatran and 10 nmol/l thrombin, whereas higher DTI concentrations have activating effects. It is known that PAR-1 is activated at subnanomolar thrombin concentrations. Altogether, these data suggest distinct dose-dependency between the anticoagulant and antiremodeling effects of the DTIs. Indeed, they could inhibit the cellular actions of thrombin via PAR-1 before activation of coagulation cascade and formation of intra-atrial thrombus. In dilated and fibrillating human atria characterized by a high risk of thrombus, it is likely that such a low level of thrombin is reached. In this line, DTI plasma concentrations, which inhibit atrial dilation in rats (28 to 75 ng/ml at peak and 22 to 85 ng/ml at steady-state) correspond to the low therapeutic levels in humans. For example, DTI plasma levels, which have been measured in the RE-LY (Randomized Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulation Therapy) trial, ranged from 2 to 1,000 ng/ml at peak and 1 to 809 ng/ml at steady-state for the high dose of 150 mg dabigatran etexilate twice daily.

### Anticoagulant medications: the pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation anticoagulation collaborativE consensus conference [^96552531]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Pediatric extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) patients require anticoagulation to inhibit hemostatic activation and prevent thrombosis when circulating blood encounters the foreign surface of the ECMO circuit, but treatment may contribute to bleeding complications, which are reported in 70% of pediatric ECMO patients and associated with increased mortality. The most widely used systemic anticoagulant during ECMO is unfractionated heparin (UFH). UFH has a long history of use in the pediatric ECMO population and its advantages include low cost, short half-life, full reversibility, wide access to laboratory monitoring tests, for example, activated partial thromboplastin time, and clinician familiarity with use. Disadvantages include variation in patient response to fixed dosing, heparin resistance related to variable plasma binding, and variable sensitivity to the effect of antithrombin (AT) in younger children. UFH does not inhibit thrombus-bound or platelet-bound thrombin while direct thrombin inhibitors (DTIs; bivalirudin, argatroban, lepirudin) inhibit both free and bound thrombin, and are AT-independent providing a greater inhibition of thrombin than does UFH. Bivalirudin has been used in pediatric patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), heparin resistance, and continued thrombosis despite heparin therapy during ECMO, and as a first-line agent in some centers.

Evidence to guide optimal choice of anticoagulant medication(s) in pediatric ECMO is limited. The objective of this subgroup of the Pediatric ECMO Anticoagulation CollaborativE (PEACE) was to derive a systematic-review informed, modified Delphi consensus regarding the selection of anticoagulant medications during pediatric ECMO support.

### Direct thrombin inhibitors, but not the direct factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban, increase tissue factor-induced hypercoagulability in vitro and in vivo [^c2e7ecc1]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2014). Low credibility.

Rivaroxaban dose-dependently inhibited the TF-induced increase in TAT levels over a broad dose range (0.001–0.3 mg kg −1); the effect was highly significant at doses ≥ 0.03 mg kg −1 (P < 0.001), with complete inhibition at 0.3 mg kg −1 rivaroxaban (Fig. 5 A). This dose range corresponded to plasma levels of rivaroxaban of 3–766 μg L⁻¹ and prolongation of PT of 1.0–1.9-fold over baseline (Table 3). Platelet count and fibrinogen concentration were not affected over the whole dose range tested (Fig. 5 C, E). Melagatran also reduced TF-induced TAT generation at the highest dose (0.3 mg kg −1; corresponding to a plasma level of 525 μg L⁻¹ and APTT prolongation of 3.1-fold) (Table 3). However, melagatran potentiated TF-induced hypercoagulability at lower doses (0.01–0.03 mg kg −1; corresponding to plasma levels of 19–46 μg L⁻¹). At a melagatran dose of 0.01 mg kg −1 (corresponding to a plasma level of 19 μg L⁻¹ and APTT prolongation of 1.7-fold), TAT increased by 1.6-fold vs. TF control (P < 0.01; Fig. 5 B). Furthermore, fibrinogen levels decreased significantly from 2.34 ± 0.08 g L⁻¹ (TF control) to 1.41 ± 0.20 g L⁻¹ at 0.03 mg kg −1 melagatran (P < 0.001) (Fig. 5 D), and platelet count decreased from 644 × 10³ μL⁻¹ (TF control) to 559 × 10³ μL⁻¹ at 0.01 mg kg −1 melagatran (Fig. 5 F).

### Antithrombotic effects of combined PAR (protease-activated receptor)-4 antagonism and factor Xa inhibition [^c2951b40]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

Factor Xa inhibition reduces thrombin generation by blocking the enzymatic activity of factor Xa and the prothrombinase complex. As such, factor Xa inhibition may interfere with thrombin-mediated PAR1 and PAR4 receptor activation and thereby reduce the potential added efficacy of PAR4 antagonism. We, therefore, wanted to explore how the combination of PAR4 antagonism with factor Xa inhibition would affect thrombus formation. We here assess the efficacy of BMS-986141 — a novel PAR4 antagonist — in combination with clinically relevant concentrations of apixaban — a factor Xa inhibitor — in ex vivo model of human thrombus formation.

Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2019). High credibility.

Heparins — unfractionated heparin (UFH) predominantly inhibits thrombin more than factor Xa (4:1 ratio) and, given its short half-life of 60–90 min, waiting for 4 hours after discontinuation with PTT or anti-Xa check is sufficient to normalize bleeding risk; low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) inhibits factor Xa more than thrombin (4:1 ratio), has a half-life of 4–6 hours, and requires waiting for at least 24 hours before a procedure; protamine is a reversal agent where 1 mg neutralizes 100 IU of UFH and the goal should be to neutralize only 80% of UFH, and for LMWH partial reversal uses 1 mg per milligram within 8 hours of last dose or 0.5 mg per milligram if beyond 8 hours; fondaparinux is often used in place of LMWH and should be treated like LMWH.

### Thrombin in complex with dabigatran can still interact with PAR-1 via exosite-I and instigate loss of vascular integrity [^1245728f]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Medium credibility.

Our results indicate that the potential enhanced expression of PAR‐1 on the endothelial surface mediated by dabigatran–thrombin complex occurred in PFP conditions with natural (anti)‐coagulation factors present and within 1 h, but without extra addition of a thrombin‐like PAR‐1 agonist.

Our multifactorial experimental setup undoubtedly not only activates the extrinsic pathway of coagulation but may also trigger fibrinolysis and/or complement, thus potentially generating other agonists that may cleave the putative surface‐stabilized PAR‐1 receptor in our system. Vascular ECs are a source of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and maintain a high plasminogen activation potential on their surface. Although plasmin can target PAR‐1 at several cleavage sites, when plasmin is present in excess of active thrombin (which is the case when dabigatran is present), it can cleave at Arg41‐Ser42 and activate PAR‐1 on platelets. Also, the complement system, potentially active in our system, may produce C4a, which has been shown to activate PAR‐1. However, deciphering candidate agonists that potentially activate surface‐stabilized PAR‐1 by dabigatran‐complexed thrombin is beyond the scope of this article. We realize that we are using supra‐therapeutic concentrations of dabigatran and rivaroxaban in our assays (10 µm), which is about 10 times higher as measured in the circulation of patients. However, these concentrations were dictated by the necessity to completely inhibit the target proteases. We speculate that the prolonged exposure in vivo with normo‐therapeutic concentrations of DOACs versus the short exposure (< 1 h) with supra‐therapeutic concentrations as in our experiments may yield comparable effects.

Collectively, our experimental setup is uniquely suited to monitor both thrombin generation and endothelial barrier function simultaneously and our results imply that cellular function should be taken into account when evaluating safety and efficacy of anticoagulants.

Our results indicate that while thrombin is catalytically fully inhibited by dabigatran, it may still be able to interact with PAR‐1, potentially leading to enhanced expression of the receptor on the endothelial surface, where it may be subject to activation by other proteases then thrombin, leading to subsequent loss of barrier function. Because rivaroxaban prevents the formation of thrombin and can maintain EC integrity, treatment with rivaroxaban and not dabigatran may be the preferred anticoagulant therapy of choice for AF patients.

### A DNA origami-based aptamer nanoarray for potent and reversible anticoagulation in hemodialysis [^2d5b5203]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Thrombin is a vital enzyme in the coagulation system and an attractive target for the design of anticoagulant drugs –. A series of thrombin-binding aptamers have been screened by systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX), an in vitro selection technique. These aptamers can directly recognize and inhibit thrombin, while the binding to thrombin can be ceased through the hybridization of complementary oligonucleotides (antidotes) –, making these aptamers promising anticoagulant drug candidates. However, naked or unmodified aptamers suffer from inefficient delivery, fast degradation and rapid renal clearance in vivo, severely limiting their application in anticoagulation. Although several nanoparticle (NP)-based strategies have been reported to enhance the stability and bioavailability of thrombin-binding aptamers –, those approaches do not offer precise control of the density and orientation of aptamers displayed on the surface of NPs. These characteristics of the delivery vectors are important to affect efficient thrombin inhibitory activity. In contrast to traditional nanoparticles, DNA/RNA nanotechnology offers a variety of nanostructures with rationally designed geometric features, precise spatial addressability and remarkable biocompatibility –. Several aptamer-tagged DNA/RNA nanostructures have been utilized for immobilizing proteins with defined nanometer spacing and precision –. Though the reported nanoarchitectures have achieved substantial anticoagulant effects in plasma in test tubes, in vivo study and clinically relevant validation have yet to be reported.

In this work, we describe a supramolecular approach to construct a nanoscale anticoagulant agent based on self-assembled DNA origami. We generate DNA origami as a template to incorporate thrombin-binding aptamers with precise nanometer spatial control (Fig. 1). Through optimizing the types, distances and numbers of aptamers, we demonstrate that DNA origami-based aptamer assemblies (Aptarrays) can specifically and efficiently bind thrombin molecules, inhibiting their coagulation function (Fig. 1). Importantly, Aptarray effectively exert anticoagulation in human plasma, fresh whole blood, a murine model and a dialyzer-containing extracorporeal circuit that mimics clinical hemodialysis. We also design antidote nucleotides that promptly reverse the anticoagulant effects engendered by the DNA nano-anticoagulants.

### Rivaroxaban versus warfarin to treat patients with thrombotic antiphospholipid syndrome, with or without systemic lupus erythematosus (RAPS): a randomised, controlled, open-label, phase 2 / 3, non-inferiority trial [^fd4ae256]. The Lancet: Haematology (2016). Medium credibility.

Discussion

When anticoagulation intensity was assessed by percentage change in ETP alone, rivaroxaban was inferior to warfarin in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome and previous venous thromboembolism. However, peak thrombin generation was lower with rivaroxaban and, therefore, the overall thrombogram indicated no difference in thrombotic risk. This conclusion is supported by in-vivo coagulation activation marker concentrations being raised in only a few patients in both treatment groups. Additionally, no new thrombotic events were seen during 6 months of treatment. No patients had major bleeds, and the frequencies of clinically relevant and minor bleeding were similar in the two groups. Quality of life, as measured with EQ-5D-5L visual analogue scores, was significantly better in the rivaroxaban group than in the warfarin group.

Rivaroxaban and warfarin both inhibit thrombin generation in patients with venous thromboembolism who do not have antiphospholipid syndrome, indicating effective anticoagulation. Inhibition of thrombin generation, which indicates effective anticoagulation, has also been shown in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome when taking warfarin. However, the mechanism of inhibition of thrombin generation differs for the two agents: warfarin reduces functional levels of vitamin-K-dependent coagulation factors, whereas rivaroxaban directly inhibits factor Xa through specific binding to its active site. Warfarin, therefore, affects all phases of thrombin generation equally, whereas rivaroxaban mainly affects the initiation and propagation of thrombin generation, leading to a delay in formation of the prothrombinase complex. As a result, the thrombin generation curve becomes protracted, which in turn lengthens the lag time and time to peak thrombin generation, and leads to greater ETP than would be expected for the degree of anticoagulation.

### EACTS / STS / AATS guidelines on temporary mechanical circulatory support in adult cardiac surgery [^1ebcc1e7]. The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2025). High credibility.

EACTS/STS/AATS temporary mechanical circulatory support (tMCS) anticoagulation agents and monitoring describe that heparin binds to and increases the activity of antithrombin, which inhibits both factor Xa and thrombin; most tMCS programs use unfractionated heparin (UFH) as the first-line anticoagulant owing to availability and relatively low cost, though UFH pharmacokinetics are highly variable due to nonspecific binding and varying antithrombin levels. Common monitoring approaches include activated clotting time (ACT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and anti‑factor Xa (anti‑Xa); ACT measures clot formation in whole blood and is influenced by haemodilution, hypothermia, platelet count, and concomitant antiplatelet therapy, while aPTT measures clot formation in platelet‑poor plasma and anti‑Xa directly quantifies heparin's inhibition of factor Xa.

### The evolving field of stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation [^67b24ee9]. Stroke (2010). Low credibility.

Vitamin K antagonists have been the standard in stroke prophylaxis in patients with atrial fibrillation for decades, but several limitations make it difficult for patients to tolerate chronic anticoagulation treatment. New drugs are under evaluation in clinical trials, including direct thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors. Antiplatelet agents such as clopidogrel and aspirin are alternatives to warfarin for stroke prevention but have proven less efficacious in trials. The only drug to have completed a Phase III trial successfully thus far is dabigatran. The 150-mg twice-a-day dose was superior to warfarin in efficacy and similar for major bleeding, whereas the 110-mg twice-a-day dose was noninferior for efficacy and reduced major bleeding. Both doses reduced intracranial hemorrhages substantially compared with warfarin. Dabigatran-assigned patients had a higher incidence of discontinuation due to gastrointestinal symptoms. Clinically apparent myocardial infarction rates were slightly higher in the dabigatran groups than the warfarin group. Dabigatran is the first agent to show superiority over warfarin for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, raising the standard for newer agents.

Discussion

In this study, we investigated the phenomenon of a paradoxical activation of coagulation at low concentrations of DTIs, as reported by Furugohri et al. and compared the effects of dabigatran, melagatran, and rivaroxaban in vitro and melagatran and rivaroxaban in vivo. In contrast to the in vivo studies by Furugohri et al. we used less severe hypercoagulable conditions, which avoided the development of DIC in the control animals. In these studies, the increase in TAT was higher (519 μg L⁻¹ and 385 μg L⁻¹), which resulted in a strong decrease in platelet count (27% and 42%, respectively), compared with TAT levels of 88 μg L⁻¹ (melagatran study) and 116 μg L⁻¹ (rivaroxaban study) in our study without a reduction in platelet count or fibrinogen levels in the control groups. Furthermore, in the study by Furugohri et al. there was a dose-dependent or time-dependent high mortality rate (up to 67% and 88% mortality, respectively) in the ximelagatran-treated animals. We used this modified model of TF-induced intravascular coagulation to reflect more closely the clinical situation of atherothrombosis. Our study showed that rivaroxaban protected against TF-induced hypercoagulation over a broad dose range. Higher doses of melagatran also exhibited a protective effect; however, at low doses/plasma concentrations, direct inhibition of thrombin with melagatran increased hypercoagulability, as shown by an increase in TAT and a decrease in fibrinogen levels, and a mild decrease in platelet count. These results are consistent with the previous studies showing a paradoxical activation of coagulation with these DTIs, in contrast to FXa inhibitors.

Antithrombotic therapy in GI endoscopy — drug categories and examples are described for conditions such as atrial fibrillation (AF), acute coronary syndrome (ACS), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), hypercoagulable states, and endoprostheses. Antithrombics include medications classified as anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents (APAs); anticoagulants prevent clotting and include the following 4 drug classes: vitamin K antagonists (eg, warfarin), heparin derivatives (eg, unfractionated [UFH] and low molecular weight [LMWH]), direct factor Xa inhibitors (eg, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban), and direct thrombin inhibitors (eg, dabigatran, hirudins, argatroban). APAs decrease platelet aggregation to prevent thrombus formation and include the thienopyridines (eg, clopidogrel, prasugrel, ticlopidine, and ticagrelor), the protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) inhibitor vorapaxar, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors (eg, abciximab, eptifibatide, and tirofiban).

### Antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation: the seventh ACCP conference on antithrombotic and thrombolytic therapy [^7404dcae]. Chest (2004). Low credibility.

This chapter about antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation (AF) is part of the Seventh ACCP Conference on Antithrombotic and Thrombolytic Therapy: Evidence Based Guidelines. Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggests that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see Guyatt et al, CHEST 2004; 126:179S-187S). Among the key recommendations in this chapter are the following (all vitamin K antagonist [VKA] recommendations have a target international normalized ratio [INR] of 2.5; range, 2.0 to 3.0): In patients with persistent or paroxysmal AF (PAF) [intermittent AF] at high risk of stroke (ie, having any of the following features: prior ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or systemic embolism, age > 75 years, moderately or severely impaired left ventricular systolic function and/or congestive heart failure, history of hypertension, or diabetes mellitus), we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA, such as warfarin (Grade 1A). In patients with persistent AF or PAF, age 65 to 75 years, in the absence of other risk factors, we recommend antithrombotic therapy with either an oral VKA or aspirin, 325 mg/d, in this group of patients who are at intermediate risk of stroke (Grade 1A). In patients with persistent AF or PAF < 65 years old and with no other risk factors, we recommend aspirin, 325 mg/d (Grade 1B). For patients with AF and mitral stenosis, we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA (Grade 1C+). For patients with AF and prosthetic heart valves, we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA (Grade 1C+); the target INR may be increased and aspirin added depending on valve type and position, and on patient factors. For patients with AF of ≥ 48 h or of unknown duration for whom pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion is planned, we recommend anticoagulation with an oral VKA for 3 weeks before and for at least 4 weeks after successful cardioversion (Grade 1C+). For patients with AF of ≥ 48 h or of unknown duration undergoing pharmacologic or electrical cardioversion, an alternative strategy is anticoagulation and screening multiplane transesophageal echocardiography (Grade 1B). If no thrombus is seen and cardioversion is successful, we recommend anticoagulation for at least 4 weeks (Grade 1B). For patients with AF of known duration < 48 h, we suggest cardioversion without anticoagulation (Grade 2C). However, in patients without contraindications to anticoagulation, we suggest beginning IV heparin or low molecular weight heparin at presentation (Grade 2C).

### Engineered factor Xa variants retain procoagulant activity independent of direct factor Xa inhibitors [^7ede500b]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

The absence of an adequate reversal strategy to prevent and stop potential life-threatening bleeding complications is a major drawback to the clinical use of the direct oral inhibitors of blood coagulation factor Xa. Here we show that specific modifications of the substrate-binding aromatic S4 subpocket within the factor Xa active site disrupt high-affinity engagement of the direct factor Xa inhibitors. These modifications either entail amino-acid substitution of S4 subsite residues Tyr99 and/or Phe174 (chymotrypsinogen numbering), or extension of the 99-loop that borders the S4 subsite. The latter modifications led to the engineering of a factor Xa variant that is able to support coagulation in human plasma spiked with (supra-)physiological concentrations of direct factor Xa inhibitors. As such, this factor Xa variant has the potential to be employed to bypass the direct factor Xa inhibitor-mediated anticoagulation in patients that require restoration of blood coagulation.

### Modulation of the coagulation cascade using aptamers [^a4c03f21]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2015). Low credibility.

As a novel class of therapeutics, aptamers, or nucleic acid ligands, have garnered clinical interest because of the ease of isolating a highly specific aptamer against a wide range of targets, their chemical flexibility and synthesis, and their inherent ability to have their function reversed. The following review details the development and molecular mechanisms of aptamers targeting specific proteases in the coagulation cascade. The ability of these anticoagulant aptamers to bind to and inhibit exosite function rather than binding within the active site highlights the importance of exosites in blocking protein function. As both exosite inhibitors and reversible agents, the use of aptamers is a promising strategy for future therapeutics.

### Successful use of bivalirudin in neonates for postoperative aortopulmonary shunt thrombosis prevention [^4aaf3da9]. JTCVS Techniques (2025). Medium credibility.

Bivalirudin, in particular, may be favorable in neonatal patients due to its direct inhibition of thrombin (without the need for a cofactor such as AT3). In addition, bivalirudin induces its anticoagulant effect by inhibiting platelet activation and preventing clot formation (via direct inhibition of circulating thrombin); in addition, bivalirudin can potentially induce clot lysis via its direct inhibition of clot-bound thrombin. Published literature supports the use of bivalirudin for anticoagulation therapy in cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and mechanical circulatory support; however, data for its use in thromboprevention are limited. We present a series of neonates undergoing AP shunt with a modified Blalock Taussig Thomas (mBTT) or central shunt who received immediate postoperative shunt thrombosis prevention with bivalirudin, followed by a combination of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) and ASA.

New anticoagulants and new antiplatelet agents on the horizon — emerging targets and early data: The text anticipates novel antiplatelet drugs that selectively inhibit arterial thrombosis without disrupting normal haemostasis and lists candidate targets including the interaction of von Willebrand factor with glycoprotein Ibα, GPVI, GPIIb/IIIa (integrin αIIbβ3), the thrombin receptor PAR-1, and the ADP receptor P2Y12. It also states that anticoagulant development is focusing on other coagulation factors such as Factor XI and XII, with Factor XI highlighted as a promising target; congenital factor XI deficiency is associated with only mild bleeding and factor XI–deficient mice show reduced thrombosis. A recent Phase II trial is cited in which antisense inhibition of factor XI, compared with enoxaparin, reduced venous thromboembolism without increasing bleeding after elective knee arthroplasty, and whether such agents can be translated to thromboprophylaxis for AF patients in the ACS or PCI setting requires further study.

Some people with atrial fibrillation are unaware and have no symptoms. Others may have an irregular heartbeat, palpitations, fatigue, or shortness of breath. The risk for atrial fibrillation increases with age. High blood pressure, the risk for which also increases with age, accounts for at least 1 in 5 cases of atrial fibrillation.

5 Strokes related to atrial fibrillation tend to be more severe than strokes with other underlying causes. 5 Oral anticoagulant medications, like warfarin, when appropriately prescribed and used, significantly reduce the risk of stroke in people with atrial fibrillation. In addition to warfarin, there are now several direct-acting oral anticoagulants that are FDA approved. 7 National clinical practice guidelines recommend DOACs as first-line agents for most indications, including nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, especially among older patients with an elevated bleeding risk. 8 However, data suggest that appropriate anticoagulation therapies are sub-optimally utilized among patients with atrial fibrillation.
