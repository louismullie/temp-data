## Question

What is the recommended immunosuppressive therapy for a patient with all positive HLA antibodies?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the recommended immunosuppressive therapy for a patient with "all positive HLA antibodies". Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "all positive HLA antibodies" actually means clinically and how to distinguish donor-specific from non–donor-specific antibodies. Then, I should verify the transplant context because management differs between solid organ transplantation and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Next, I will review risk stratification by antibody strength and complement-fixing properties. After that, I should outline evidence-based strategies for solid organ transplantation, including induction, maintenance, and desensitization. Then, I will examine HSCT-specific desensitization protocols and monitoring. Finally, I will consider special scenarios, monitoring cadence, and synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with caveats about evidence quality and center-specific protocols.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because "all positive HLA antibodies" is imprecise. Clinically, we separate donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA), which target the donor's HLA and carry the highest risk, from non–donor-specific HLA antibodies, which are broader and generally carry less independent risk, though they may amplify injury when DSA are present. I should also distinguish solid organ transplantation from allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, as thresholds and therapies differ substantially [^112RTi9W] [^113npou8].

> Next, I should review the transplant context because management hinges on it. In solid organ transplantation, particularly kidney, heart, and lung, DSA are linked to antibody-mediated rejection and graft loss, and guidelines emphasize risk stratification and tailored immunosuppression. In HSCT, DSA are associated with primary graft failure and delayed engraftment, prompting preemptive desensitization when DSA levels are above center-defined thresholds. Non-DSA HLA antibodies are not an indication for desensitization in HSCT and are managed differently in solid organ protocols [^112qsn4p] [^113CorYs] [^115BdCiD].

> I will now examine risk stratification by antibody strength, since this drives therapy. Wait, let me verify the commonly used thresholds. In HSCT, most centers consider DSA above about 1,000–2,000 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) as clinically significant and warranting desensitization, with higher levels (for example, > 20,000 MFI) carrying very high risk and often necessitating alternative donor selection or investigational approaches. In solid organ transplantation, risk is graded by DSA strength, C1q positivity, and crossmatch results, with higher-binding DSA and complement-fixing DSA portending worse outcomes and guiding intensified immunosuppression or desensitization [^1172UwpA] [^116Rcpkr] [^115xRw9P].

> For solid organ transplantation, I should confirm induction strategies. In immunologically high-risk patients, including those with DSA, lymphocyte-depleting induction with antithymocyte globulin (ATG) reduces acute rejection and is favored over interleukin-2 receptor antagonists in many guidelines, whereas low-risk patients may receive IL-2RA induction. I initially thought IL-2RA might suffice across the board, but wait, randomized data in high-risk recipients show lower rejection with ATG, so I should correct that and align with risk-based induction choices [^114ZL6Wj] [^114CHZjQ] [^1177ZPjQ].

> Next, I should review maintenance immunosuppression and the role of adherence. Let me consider the OuTSMART randomized strategy, which screened for HLA antibodies and optimized tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisolone with adherence support. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — despite reducing biopsy-proven rejection, this intervention did not delay graft failure, underscoring that DSA mark risk but optimizing conventional therapy alone may be insufficient once DSA emerge. This reinforces the need for early detection, adherence optimization, and, in some cases, desensitization rather than simple drug intensification alone [^115BdCiD] [^113nc5gZ].

> I should double-check desensitization options for solid organ DSA. When DSA are present and an incompatible transplant is planned, multimodal desensitization typically includes plasmapheresis or immunoadsorption, IVIG, and B-cell depletion with rituximab; some protocols add bortezomib or complement blockade in select cases. Importantly, antibody avoidance via paired exchange or acceptable mismatch programs is generally preferred when feasible, as desensitization may improve transplant access but does not consistently improve long-term outcomes compared with compatible transplants [^112qsn4p] [^112o26J2] [^117JtVJu].

> For HSCT, I need to ensure I capture the specific thresholds and protocols. ASTCT recommends desensitization for DSA above about 2,000 MFI in haploidentical or unrelated transplants and above about 1,000 MFI in cord blood transplants, using plasmapheresis, rituximab, IVIG, and sometimes donor-derived antigen infusions (buffy coat or platelets) to neutralize DSA. Very high DSA levels (> 20,000 MFI) are associated with high rates of graft failure despite therapy, prompting consideration of alternative donors or investigational strategies. I should confirm that monitoring is intensified around conditioning and engraftment, with repeat DSA checks and escalation if levels rebound [^1172UwpA] [^114RosHJ] [^114SG1JY] [^1164GuMu].

> But wait, what if the "all positive HLA antibodies" are non-DSA in solid organ candidates? I should verify that non-DSA HLA antibodies alone are not an indication for desensitization; instead, management focuses on standard immunosuppression and surveillance, with attention to the possibility that non-DSA may potentiate injury when DSA arise. Routine complement-binding assays are not recommended for all patients, though they may inform risk in select scenarios [^115BdCiD] [^111xYCQf] [^113w42fq].

> Next, I should review monitoring cadence and assay strategy. In sensitized solid organ candidates, HLA antibody testing should be performed at evaluation, at regular intervals on the waitlist, and after sensitizing events; solid-phase assays are preferred for specificity, and results should be interpreted in the context of donor typing and crossmatch. In HSCT, DSA are typically monitored before conditioning, immediately pre-infusion, and frequently post-transplant until engraftment, with escalation if DSA rise or persist [^117BnUMs] [^111Kd2nN] [^1164GuMu].

> I will now examine special scenarios. In heart transplantation, sensitized patients on mechanical circulatory support should have HLA antibodies checked every 3 months and again 1–2 weeks after sensitizing events; many programs avoid positive crossmatch donors and may employ desensitization with IVIG, plasmapheresis, rituximab, or complement blockade when crossing DSA is unavoidable. In kidney transplantation, some centers individualize immunosuppression to molecular mismatch and DSA characteristics, but evidence for precision dosing outside of trials remains limited and should be applied cautiously [^112ho3Bu] [^117L3tzM] [^112Vm4NQ].

> Hold on, I should verify the strength of evidence and explicitly state limitations. Much of the desensitization literature consists of observational studies and consensus recommendations; randomized data like OuTSMART show that optimizing conventional therapy after DSA detection does not prevent graft failure, highlighting the need for better predictive biomarkers and novel therapies. Therefore, decisions should be made in specialized centers with expertise, and patients counseled about uncertainties and trade-offs [^115BdCiD] [^115xRw9P] [^112qsn4p].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the recommendation is risk-stratified and context-specific. For solid organ transplantation with DSA, favor ATG induction in high-risk patients, maintain standard triple therapy with tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone with attention to adherence, and consider desensitization only when antibody avoidance is not feasible, recognizing that long-term benefits are uncertain. For HSCT with DSA above 1,000–2,000 MFI, proceed with multimodal desensitization and close monitoring, and consider alternative donors if DSA are very high. For non-DSA HLA antibodies in solid organ candidates, use standard immunosuppression and surveillance without desensitization. Throughout, coordinate care with transplant immunology and tailor decisions to patient-specific risk, center protocols, and evolving evidence [^114ZL6Wj] [^1172UwpA] [^112qsn4p] [^112RTi9W].

For patients with broadly reactive HLA antibodies ("all positive"), **antibody avoidance is preferred** [^112qsn4p] through paired exchange or acceptable mismatch programs to minimize rejection risk [^111X7gRz]. If avoidance is not feasible, **desensitization with plasmapheresis, IVIG, and rituximab** is recommended [^113MNxDV] to reduce antibody levels and enable transplantation [^1126G7uq]. Maintenance immunosuppression should be intensified with tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and corticosteroids, with consideration of belatacept in selected cases [^1125G8EP]. Post-transplant, **close monitoring** for rejection and infection is essential, with prompt treatment of any rejection episodes [^115xRw9P].

---

## Pre-transplant strategies

### Antibody avoidance

- **Paired kidney exchange (PKE)**: Preferred strategy to find a compatible donor without DSA [^112qsn4p] [^111X7gRz].
- **Acceptable mismatch programs**: Use algorithms to identify donors with acceptable mismatches, reducing rejection risk [^111X7gRz].
- **Increased access to donor pool**: Expand donor options to improve chances of finding a compatible match [^111xYCQf].

---

### Desensitization protocols

When antibody avoidance is not feasible, **desensitization** is indicated:

| **Desensitization method** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Plasmapheresis | Removes circulating antibodies | Effective in reducing antibody levels and enabling transplantation [^113MNxDV] [^113mZrLf] |
| Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) | Neutralizes antibodies and modulates immune response | Effective in reducing antibody levels and improving transplant outcomes [^113MNxDV] [^1148FPhU] |
| Rituximab | B-cell depletion reducing antibody production | Effective in reducing antibody levels and preventing rejection [^113MNxDV] [^114RosHJ] |
| Bortezomib | Proteasome inhibitor reducing plasma cells | Used in combination protocols, though evidence is limited [^113MNxDV] [^113mZrLf] |

---

## Intraoperative and immediate post-transplant management

### Induction immunosuppression

- **Lymphocyte-depleting agents**: Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or alemtuzumab are recommended for high immunological risk patients to reduce acute rejection [^114ZL6Wj] [^114CHZjQ].
- **Interleukin-2 receptor antagonists (IL-2RA)**: Basiliximab or daclizumab for low-to-moderate risk patients [^1177ZPjQ].

---

### Maintenance immunosuppression

- **Calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)**: Tacrolimus is preferred due to its potency in preventing rejection [^notfound].
- **Antiproliferative agent**: Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or mycophenolic acid (MPA) is standard [^notfound].
- **Corticosteroids**: Prednisone is commonly used, though some protocols aim for steroid minimization [^notfound].
- **Belatacept**: Consider in selected EBV-seropositive, low-risk patients to avoid nephrotoxicity [^1125G8EP].

---

## Post-transplant monitoring and management

### Monitoring

- **Serial HLA antibody testing**: Regular monitoring to detect de novo DSA and guide therapy [^115xRw9P].
- **Protocol biopsies**: Consider in high-risk patients to detect subclinical rejection [^1119Kaqp].
- **Graft function monitoring**: Close surveillance of serum creatinine, eGFR, and proteinuria [^1119Kaqp].

---

### Management of rejection

Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) is treated with **plasmapheresis or immunoadsorption** to remove antibodies [^117JtVJu], IVIG to neutralize antibodies and modulate immunity, and rituximab for B-cell depletion. Corticosteroids are used for acute cellular rejection, and ATG is reserved for severe or steroid-resistant cases.

---

## Special considerations

- **Infection prophylaxis**: Essential due to intensified immunosuppression, including Pneumocystis jirovecii, CMV, and BK virus prophylaxis [^notfound].
- **Vaccination**: Ensure up-to-date vaccinations pre-transplant; avoid live vaccines post-transplant [^notfound].
- **Patient education**: Emphasize adherence and recognition of rejection signs [^112gYnJa].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended strategy** |
|-|-|
| Pre-transplant | - Antibody avoidance (PKE, acceptable mismatch) [^112qsn4p] <br/> - Desensitization if avoidance not feasible [^113MNxDV] |
| Intraoperative | - Lymphocyte-depleting induction (ATG or alemtuzumab) [^114ZL6Wj] |
| Maintenance | - Tacrolimus <br/> - Mycophenolate <br/> - Prednisone <br/> - Consider belatacept [^1125G8EP] |
| Post-transplant | - Serial monitoring <br/> - Protocol biopsies <br/> - Aggressive rejection treatment [^115xRw9P] |

---

Patients with broadly reactive HLA antibodies require a **multifaceted approach**, prioritizing antibody avoidance and, when necessary, desensitization, with intensified immunosuppression and vigilant post-transplant monitoring to optimize outcomes [^115xRw9P].

Although anti-HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) are commonly measured in clinical practice and their relationship with transplant outcome is well established, clinical recommendations for anti-HLA antibody assessment are sparse. Supported by a careful and critical review of the current literature performed by the Sensitization in Transplantation: Assessment of Risk 2022 working group, this consensus report provides clinical practice recommendations in kidney, heart, lung, and liver transplantation based on expert assessment of quality and strength of evidence. The recommendations address 3 major clinical problems in transplantation and include guidance regarding posttransplant DSA assessment and application to diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutics: (1) the clinical implications of positive posttransplant DSA detection according to DSA status (ie, preformed or de novo), (2) the relevance of posttransplant DSA assessment for precision diagnosis of antibody-mediated rejection and for treatment management, and (3) the relevance of posttransplant DSA for allograft prognosis and risk stratification. This consensus report also highlights gaps in current knowledge and provides directions for clinical investigations and trials in the future that will further refine the clinical utility of posttransplant DSA assessment, leading to improved transplant management and patient care.

Patient education and immunosuppression withdrawal after graft failure — The commentary notes the lack of KDIGO recommendations on patient education regarding sensitization events and on immunosuppression withdrawal in patients with a failing allograft who are at high risk of developing HLA antibodies after withdrawal; it states that tailoring withdrawal is necessary based on residual kidney function, patient age, risk of side effects, and likelihood of a repeat transplant within a reasonable time, and that the KDOQI work group strongly believes all transplant centers should focus heavily on educating transplant recipients about sensitizing events and the role of nonadherence in HLA sensitization to improve chances of a repeat transplant.

### Optimized immunosuppression to prevent graft failure in renal transplant recipients with HLA antibodies (OuTSMART): a randomised controlled trial [^113nc5gZ]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Kidney transplantation is the gold standard treatment for end stage renal failure, but transplants do not last for the natural lifespan of most recipients. 30–40% of transplants fail within 10 years(approximately 3% annually) meaning that in the USA for instance, approximately 7000 of the ∼230,000 prevalent kidney transplant patients will return to dialysis every year. Of the various reasons why this happens, the single biggest cause is immune-mediated injury, primarily directed against mismatched donor human leukocyte antigens (HLA).

Circulating antibodies (Ab) against HLA have been validated as prognostic biomarkers of kidney transplant failure by case control, and prospective observational studies, though recent systematic reviews have consistently identified low/moderate quality evidence in this area. HLA Ab specific for donor HLA (donor specific antibodies — DSA) carry a higher risk of graft loss compared to those that are not donor-specific (non-DSA). A prevalent hypothesis is that inappropriately low levels of immunosuppression, either physician-led or due to patient non-adherence, is an important contributor to the initiation of immune-mediated damage. Several small scale trials have tested various treatments in patients with early stage, biopsy-proven chronic rejection associated with HLA Ab, including several that indicate optimised treatment with tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) can stabilise transplant function, but to date there have been no large scale trials testing the utility of intervening prior to graft dysfunction and none that have used graft failure as the primary endpoint.

In OuTSMART, we tested the hypothesis that routine surveillance for the development of HLA Ab, combined with an intervention to improve adherence, followed by tailored optimised oral treatment in those who became HLA Ab+, would prevent the kidney allograft failure.

### Induction therapy for kidney transplant recipients: Do we still need anti-IL2 receptor monoclonal antibodies? [^114ZL6Wj]. American Journal of Transplantation (2017). Low credibility.

A series of trials has demonstrated that induction therapy with ATG or IL2RA induction reduces the risk of early acute rejection episodes after kidney transplantation versus controls 3, 4. In 2010, the Cochrane Collaboration published a meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials that compared IL2RA induction with placebo and with ATG 4. Biopsy‐proven acute rejection (BPAR) rates were ≈30% lower with IL2RA versus placebo (1‐year relative risk [RR] 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64–0.81) and graft loss was reduced (1‐year RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.62–0.90]). In the total cohort, consisting primarily of recipients at low immunological risk (72% being first transplants), ATG was no more effective in preventing rejection than IL2RA agents, and the safety profile favored IL2RA induction. Based largely on these findings, the 2009 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines for the care of kidney transplant patients recommended (i) that induction therapy with a biological agent be a routine part of the initial immunosuppressive regimen (grade 1B) and (ii) that an IL2RA agent be the first‐line therapy (grade 1B). KDIGO further recommended that lymphocyte‐depleting agents be used selectively in patients at high immunological risk (grade 2B) 5. KDIGO defined high immunological risk as the following conditions: high number of HLA mismatches, younger recipient age, older donor age, black ethnicity (in the United States), panel reactive antibodies > 0%, presence of a donor‐specific antibody, blood group incompatibility, delayed onset of graft function and cold ischemia time > 24 h. It is important, however, to consider the details of the studies that led to the development of these guidelines, such as the maintenance immunosuppressive regimen that was used. In view of recent evolutions in transplant care, it may be time to reassess the role of induction therapy following kidney transplantation.

KDIGO HLA antibody testing frequency and timing — A precise recommendation for the optimal frequency of HLA antibody testing cannot be made, and protocols widely in use vary in testing frequency from 4 to 24 weeks so that results used in allocation are representative of the patient's immunologic state at the time of transplant. The Work Group acknowledges that varied patient and clinical considerations, including whether HLA antibody specificity is used to guide allocation, may reduce the frequency of testing without clinical impact in certain settings. Additional testing after interval sensitizing events is recommended in all patients to document de novo and memory responses; de novo HLA IgG antibodies may take up to 6 weeks to form, whereas memory responses can occur within 7–14 days. The timing of testing after a sensitizing event may be sooner than six weeks depending on clinical need; where financial considerations may prevent regular testing, we encourage a baseline test and repeat testing at 6 weeks after sensitizing events. Where live donors and recipients are reliably shown to be HLA identical at all loci, testing may also be reduced without impacting clinical risk assessment.

### Optimized immunosuppression to prevent graft failure in renal transplant recipients with HLA antibodies (OuTSMART): a randomised controlled trial [^115BdCiD]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

3% of kidney transplant recipients return to dialysis annually upon allograft failure. Development of antibodies (Ab) against human leukocyte antigens (HLA) is a validated prognostic biomarker of allograft failure. We tested whether screening for HLA Ab, combined with an intervention to improve adherence and optimization of immunosuppression could prevent allograft failure.

Methods

Prospective, open-labelled randomised biomarker-based strategy (hybrid) trial in 13 UK transplant centres [EudraCT (2012-004308-36) and ISRCTN (46157828)]. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to unblinded or double-blinded arms and screened every 8 months. Unblinded HLA Ab+ patients were interviewed to encourage medication adherence and had tailored optimisation of Tacrolimus, Mycophenolate mofetil and Prednisolone. The primary outcome was time to graft failure in an intention to treat analysis. The trial had 80% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.49 in donor specific antibody (DSA)+ patients.

Findings

From 11/9/13 to 27/10/16, 5519 were screened for eligibility and 2037 randomised (1028 to unblinded care and 1009 to double blinded care). We identified 198 with DSA and 818 with non-DSA. Development of DSA, but not non-DSA was predictive of graft failure. HRs for graft failure in unblinded DSA+ and non-DSA+ groups were 1.54 (95% CI: 0.72 to 3.30) and 0.97 (0.54–1.74) respectively, providing no evidence of an intervention effect. Non-inferiority for the overall unblinded versus blinded comparison was not demonstrated as the upper confidence limit of the HR for graft failure exceeded 1.4 (1.02, 95% CI: 0.72 to 1.44). The only secondary endpoint reduced in the unblinded arm was biopsy-proven rejection.

Interpretation

Intervention to improve adherence and optimize immunosuppression does not delay failure of renal transplants after development of DSA. Whilst DSA predicts increased risk of allograft failure, novel interventions are needed before screening can be used to direct therapy.

### ASTCT consensus recommendations on testing and treatment of patients with donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies [^113npou8]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (DSA) are an important cause of engraftment failure and may negatively impact survival outcomes of patients receiving allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using an HLA-mismatched allograft. The incidence of DSA varies across studies, depending on individual factors, detection or identification methods and thresholds considered clinically relevant. Although DSA testing by multiplex bead arrays remains semiquantitative, it has been widely adopted as a standard test in most transplant centers. Additional testing to determine risk of allograft rejection may include assays with HLA antigens in natural conformation, such as flow cytometric crossmatch, and/or antibody binding assays, such as C1q testing. Patients with low level of DSA (< 2,000 mean fluorescence intensity; MFI) may not require treatment, while others with very high level of DSA (> 20,000 MFI) may be at very high-risk for engraftment failure despite current therapies. By contrast, in patients with moderate or high level of DSA, desensitization therapy can successfully mitigate DSA levels and improve donor cell engraftment rate, with comparable outcomes to patients without DSA. Treatment is largely empirical and multimodal, involving the removal, neutralization, and blocking of antibodies, as well as inhibition of antibody production to prevent activation of the complement cascade. Desensitization protocols are based on accumulated multicenter experience, while prospective multicenter studies remain lacking. Most patients require a full intensity protocol that includes plasma exchange, while protocols relying only on rituximab and intravenous immunoglobulin may be sufficient for patients with lower DSA levels and negative C1q and/or flow cytometric crossmatch. Monitoring DSA levels before and after HSCT could guide preemptive treatment when high levels persist after stem cell infusion. This paper aims to standardize current evidence-based practice and formulate future directions to improve upon current knowledge and advance treatment for this relatively rare, but potentially serious complication in allogeneic HSCT recipients.

Desensitization outcomes and high-DSA risk signals — Compared with a control group, Ciurea et al. showed efficacy in treating patients with up to 20,000 MFI and an increased likelihood of neutrophil engraftment with a buffy coat infusion (SHR 2.09, P = 0.049), and there were no significant differences in transplant outcomes, including NRM and survival compared to a control group of patients without DSA. Patients with DSA ⩾20,000 MFI had a higher rate of graft failure, NRM, and worse survival. Addition of immunosuppressive agents before the conditioning regimen (such as tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil) has also been proposed in some studies, yet efficacy of this approach remains unclear, and bortezomib was evaluated prospectively in a desensitization protocol and demonstrated limited efficacy, leading to stopping the trial and needing for additional desensitization therapies.

HLA antibodies in transplant candidates — testing frequency and timing state that a precise recommendation for the optimal frequency of HLA antibody testing cannot be made, that protocols widely in use vary in testing frequency from 4 to 24 weeks, and that additional testing after interval sensitizing events is recommended in all patients. De novo HLA IgG antibodies may take up to 6 weeks to form whereas memory responses can occur within 7–14 days, the timing of testing after a sensitizing event may be sooner than six weeks depending on clinical need, where financial considerations may prevent regular testing we encourage a baseline test and repeat testing 2 to 6 weeks after sensitizing events, and where live donors and recipients are reliably shown to be HLA identical at all loci testing may also be reduced without impacting clinical risk assessment.

### The management of antibodies in heart transplantation: an ISHLT consensus document [^115HbNVM]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

Despite the successes from refined peri-operative management techniques and immunosuppressive therapies, antibodies remain a serious cause of morbidity and mortality for patients both before and after heart transplantation. Patients awaiting transplant who possess antibodies against human leukocyte antigen are disadvantaged by having to wait longer to receive an organ from a suitably matched donor. The number of pre-sensitized patients has been increasing, a trend that is likely due to the increased use of mechanical circulatory support devices. Even patients who are not pre-sensitized can go on to produce donor-specific antibodies after transplant, which are associated with worse outcomes. The difficulty in managing antibodies is uncertainty over which antibodies are of clinical relevance, which patients to treat, and which treatments are most effective and safe. There is a distinct lack of data from prospective trials. An international consensus conference was organized and attended by 103 participants from 75 centers to debate contentious issues, determine the best practices, and formulate ideas for future research on antibodies. Prominent experts presented state-of-the-art talks on antibodies, which were followed by group discussions, and then, finally, a reconvened session to establish consensus where possible. Herein we address the discussion, consensus points, and research ideas.

Desensitization terminology and evidence — The commentary cautions that the term "desensitization" needs careful use, noting that transplant in the context of preformed donor-specific antibody (DSA) and/or positive crossmatch does not always include antibody-removal therapy and therefore HLA-incompatible transplant is not synonymous with desensitization; it states that data to inform desensitization practices are inadequate, randomized controlled trials have not shown improved long-term allograft survival with desensitization, several retrospective studies report acceptable short-term results without specific desensitization when DSA levels are low or flow cytometric crossmatch is positive, and historically some transplants occurred with low levels of alloantibody.

Non-HLA antibodies — testing scope before transplantation: Despite reported associations of non-HLA antibodies (eg, anti-angiotensin II type 1 receptor, MICA, anti-endothelial) with rejection and/or graft loss, their independent pre-transplant risk role remains controversial; these antibodies may augment the effect of HLA DSA in some patients, so testing should be performed on a case-by-case basis when clinically relevant, but routine pre-transplant measurement of non-HLA antibodies cannot be recommended.

DSA levels — summary and recommendations: Current evidence suggests that DSA < 2,000 MFI in haploidentical HSCT and < 1,000 MFI in single CBT have minimal impact on graft outcome and desensitization is not required. (Levels of evidence 2+). We recommend repeated DSA testing within 2 weeks of starting conditioning regimen in transplant recipients with previous history of low level DSA (< 2,000 MFI in haploidentical HSCT and < 1,000 MFI in single CBT) who have high risk of increased DSA levels such as receiving multiple units of blood transfusion or granulocyte infusion. (Grade of recommendation: C; Levels of evidence 2-). Higher DSA levels are associated with poor graft function, graft failure, and worse survival. A DSA level > 1,000 MFI for CBT and > 2,000 MFI for haploidentical and unrelated HSCT might serve as a threshold to initiate desensitization. (Grade of recommendation: C, Levels of evidence 2+).

1 INTRODUCTION

In a 2016 US Food and Drug Administration public meeting on patient‐focused drug development, transplant recipients voiced their desire to have immunosuppressive therapy individualized and simplified to avoid side effects while ensuring efficacy. 1 Unfortunately, when induction therapy is selected for renal transplant recipients, current evidence shows that an individual's clinical risk factors only account for 10%‐33% of the observed variation in practice, while transplant center effect was responsible for the majority (51%‐61%) of the variation. 2 Compounding the problem, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of immunosuppression minimization that have attempted to identify "low risk" recipients using clinical, serologic, and histologic criteria have been unsuccessful, suggesting that traditional risk factors hold little utility to personalize patient care. 3, 4, 5 Thus, an unmet need in transplantation is the accurate definition of an individual's alloimmune risk for a given donor at the time of transplant: a fundamental requirement if the field is to move to precision medicine.

In 2017, the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics established the Sensitization in Transplantation: Assessment of Risk (STAR) Working Group. The goal of this expert panel is to conduct critical reviews of the pretransplant diagnostics literature and make recommendations for alloimmune risk assessment building on the 2009 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) and the 2013 Transplant Society clinical practice guidelines. 6, 7, 8 The STAR 2017 report created a framework that recommended 2 independent risk assessments: 1 related to the risk of immunologic memory and a second related to the risk of a primary (ie, de novo) alloimmune response posttransplant. In this context, the STAR Working Group identified that the HLA molecular mismatch was a key determinant of an individual's primary alloimmune risk and called for research to determine optimal approaches to define HLA molecular mismatch risk categories.

In this study, building on our prior work using HLAMatchmaker as a computational tool to assess donor‐recipient HLA relatedness, 9, 10 we evaluated a novel approach to quantify HLA molecular mismatch allowing us to more precisely classify individuals into low, intermediate, or high alloimmune risk categories at the time of kidney transplant. These risk categories correlated with primary alloimmune events (ie, T cell–mediated rejection [TCMR], de novo donor‐specific antibody [dnDSA] development, antibody‐mediated rejection [ABMR]), as well as all‐cause graft loss.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and management of candidates for kidney transplantation [^113A7DKc]. Transplantation (2020). High credibility.

KDIGO kidney transplant candidate immunologic evaluation — definitions and sensitization history guidance are as follows: HLA antibody is any antibody to any HLA antigen or allelic variant at an antigen, panel reactive antibody (PRA) is the presence of any detectable HLA antibody, and calculated PRA (cPRA) estimates the percentage of donors in a population to whom a transplant candidate has at least one HLA antibody specificity directed. Sensitizing events and clinical events that can impact PRA should be communicated to the HLA laboratory in a timely fashion, and a sensitization history is essential for HLA laboratory staff to interpret testing results. Documenting and reporting a reliable clinical history is an ungraded recommendation; patients with a history of a sensitizing event, even without circulating HLA antibodies detected, should be considered as having potential for memory responses after transplant, and the immunologic history is also critical for perioperative management of patients.

### Combination immunosuppressive therapy to prevent kidney… [^113Rgyqn]. ClinicalTrials (2004). Low credibility.

Combination Immunosuppressive Therapy to Prevent Kidney Transplant Rejection in AdultsClinicalTrials. gov ID Study Overview Transplant rejection occurs when a patient's body does not recognize the new organ and attacks it. Patients who have kidney transplants must take drugs to prevent transplant rejection. Alemtuzumab is a man-made antibody used to treat certain blood disorders. The purpose of this study is to test the safety and effectiveness of using alemtuzumab in combination with two other drugs, sirolimus and tacrolimus, to prevent organ rejection after kidney transplantation. This study will also test whether this combination of medications will allow patients to eventually stop taking antirejection medications entirely. Regimens that are less toxic to or can eventually be withdrawn from transplant recipients are needed. Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to and depletes excess T cells in the bone marrow of leukemia patients.

This study will determine the effects of intravenous alemtuzumab and oral sirolimus and tacrolimus after kidney transplantation. The study will also evaluate this regimen's potential to allow eventual discontinuation of components of long-term immunosuppressive therapy. After transplant, patients will receive up to 10 days of valganciclovir or acyclovir. Participants will take tacrolimus daily by mouth for at least 60 days after transplant and sirolimus daily by mouth for at least 12 months after transplant. As part of opportunistic infection prophylaxis, participants will also take sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim by mouth 3 times a week, valganciclovir or acyclovir for up to 10 days post-transplant, and clotrimazole or nystatin by mouth for at least 3 months post-transplant.

Rationale

Unfortunately there are currently no good markers of early allograft injury. A number of non-invasive biomarkers have been proposed including urine and serum microRNA profiling but the clinical utility and additive predictive value of these compared to traditional markers – serum creatinine, proteinuria, histopathology – is uncertain. Graft damage can be detected by protocol biopsy but the utility of this approach is unproven. Studies show that all protocol biopsies at 3 years post transplantation display evidence of some degree of CAI and by 5 years this is classed as moderate or severe in over 60% of patients. Therefore current best practice consists of vigilant monitoring of simple clinical markers of allograft function including serum creatinine and proteinuria. More complex and expensive approaches such as monitoring serum anti-HLA antibodies also remain unproven.

Deterioration in graft function is a heterogeneous entity with multiple causes, both immunological and non-immunological. Treatment may entail diametrically opposite strategies and therefore deterioration of allograft function should be investigated by percutaneous biopsy if possible. Tissue samples should be examined by an experienced renal histopathologist and classified according to the Banff criteria. Staining for C4d deposition and SV40 antigen should be routinely available because positive staining will affect the treatment strategy.

Although there is not yet any proven therapy, it is important to recognise chronic humoral rejection diagnosed according to the Banff criteria. The detection of anti-HLA antibodies and C4d staining on transplant biopsy are associated with worse clinical outcomes. More recently the complement binding ability of anti-HLA antibodies has been shown to impact upon graft survival. Post-transplant screening for anti-HLA antibodies has been suggested but there is not yet a solid evidence base to recommend it routinely in low or moderate immunological risk patients, nor to routinely determine the complement fixing ability of detected anti-HLA antibodies. In patients who are sensitised or deemed high immunological risk, a timetable of post-transplant antibody sampling should be agreed within the transplant centre. This is in line with the recommendations set out in both the BSHI/BTS and the Transplantation Society Guidelines.

Identifying a process likely to lead to a decline in long term transplant function will be worrying for patients/their carers. It is important to involve patients in treatment decisions including need for biopsy, alterations to the immunosuppressive regime. This may also include plans for return to dialysis or re-transplantation.

### Comparing ATG or post-transplant cyclophosphamide to… [^116W8fSj]. NCI (2016). Low credibility.

Immunosuppressive therapy, such as anti-thymocyte globulin, is used to decrease the body's immune response and reduces the risk of GVHD. It is not yet known which combination of drugs: 1) ATG, methotrexate, and calcineurin inhibitor 2) cyclophosphamide and calcineurin inhibitor, or 3) methotrexate and calcineurin inhibitor may work best to prevent graft versus host disease and result in best overall outcome after donor stem cell transplant.
- Donors are excluded when preexisting immunoreactivity is identified that would jeopardize donor hematopoietic cell engraftment. This determination is based on the standard practice of the individual institution. The recommended procedure for patients with 10 of 10 HLA allele level match is to obtain a panel reactive antibody screens to class I and class II antigens for all patients before hematopoietic cell transplantation.

OUTLINE: CONDITIONING REGIMENS: Participants receive 1 of 3 regimens and are randomized to 1 of 3 arms for GVHD prophylaxis. REGIMEN A: Participants undergo total body irradiation twice daily on days -6 to -4, then receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1–2 hours on days -3 and -2. Participants randomized to Arm 2 only receive TBI on days -3 to -1. REGIMEN B: Participants receive fludarabine phosphate IV and busulfan IV every 6 hours on days -5 to -2. REGIMEN C: Participants receive busulfan orally or IV every 6 hours on days -7 to -4 and cyclophosphamide IV over 1–2 hours on days -3 and -2. All participants undergo peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day
0. **ARM 1**: Participants receive anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 4–6 hours on days -3 to -1.

Beginning day -1, participants also receive tacrolimus IV or cyclosporine IV twice daily tapered at day 50, and methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6 and 11 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

Discussion

Despite modern immunosuppression 5–10% of renal transplant patients still experience acute rejection leading to an overall reduced graft survival. There are currently no randomized controlled trials defining the optimal immunosuppressive strategy in immunologically high-risk recipients. This study retrospectively tested the efficacy of a tailored immunosuppression approach in kidney transplant recipients with risk-stratified treatment protocols for five different patient categories in our center. The main findings are the following: (1) we observed excellent patient and allograft survival rates at 1 and 4 years post-transplant; (2) we found no differences between sensitized patients (ABO compatible versus incompatible, DSA positive versus DSA negative) regarding acute rejection rates and graft survival; (3) compared with a historical control group at our center there was a significant reduction of antibody- and T cell- mediated rejection in sensitized thymoglobulin-treated patients; (4) there was no increased rate of infections leading to hospitalization among patients receiving thymoglobulin, but an increased incidence of CMV viremia, as confirmed by a recent Cochrane database review.

The optimal treatment strategy for patients sensitized to the HLA antigens of their donor is unclear. In theory, the best option is avoiding transplantation across DSA, a strategy which can be achieved by paired kidney donation in living donor transplantation and by acceptable mismatch programs in deceased donor transplantation. But even after implementing such programs a patient population remains, where no alternative option to crossing DSA exists. Whereas most centers are reluctant to transplant across a positive CDC-XM, they may accept an organ with a negative CDC-XM, but presence of DSA up to a certain MFI value. However, it is unclear what the optimal immunosuppressive strategy in this situation is. Some centers have suggested induction therapy with rituximab and/or intravenous immunoglobulins, but other reports showed a limited efficacy of this strategy in terms of prevention of AMR and graft survival. Alternatively, some centers have reported a reduction in acute rejection rate by the use of thymoglobulin induction therapy in this patient population. For example, the Basle group showed a significant reduction of clinical and subclinical AMR and TMR in their patient groups which however was monitored by protocol biopsies. In contrast to our study, they used thymoglobulin combined with high dose intravenous immunoglobulins, whereas in our study only thymoglobulin was used. The effect on the incidence of clinical acute rejection was comparable suggesting that adding intravenous immunoglobulins might not be necessary. However, we did not perform protocol biopsies and therefore cannot argue concerning subclinical rejection episodes.

Antibody surveillance and rejection monitoring — Patients on mechanical circulatory support (MCS) should have HLA antibodies checked every 3 months; after blood transfusions or infections they should be checked 1 to 2 weeks after the event, and when using a desensitization strategy they should be checked 1 to 2 weeks after therapy. After transplant, routine surveillance for antibody mediated rejection is recommended with attention to pathological and immunopathological findings in the endomyocardial biopsy; diagnosis is based on allograft biopsy pathology, and post-transplant circulating antibody monitoring is also recommended with particular attention to de-novo donor-specific antibodies, considering their association with poor patient survival.

### Rituximab treatment to block HLA antibodies in renal transplant recipients… [^113A24Y9]. ClinicalTrials (2005). Low credibility.

Therapeutic regimens that have been used in an attempt to deplete HLA or ABO antibodies include plasmapheresis, IVIg, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil, and anti-CD20. Of these regimens, the most specific is anti-CD20, rituximab, a therapy now FDA approved for B cell proliferative diseases. Although initially introduced for the treatment of neoplasm, the humoral immunosuppressant effects of rituximab have been shown to have clinical significance. Rituximab interferes with both primary and secondary humoral responses by eliminating B-cells prior to antigen exposure, thus interfering with differentiation into antibody secreting cells and specific antibody production.

Desensitization approaches for patients with DSA in HSCT — These can be classified in 5 main approaches: 1) reducing circulating levels of antibodies using plasmapheresis or immunoadsorption; 2) regulation of the B-cell pool and/or of antibody production by plasma cells using the directed therapy such as rituximab or proteasome inhibitors; 3) depleting complement or adding anti-idiotype or neutralizing antibodies by IVIG; 4) blocking DSA using donor-derived antigen from irradiated blood products in the form of a buffy coat infusion for anti-HLA antibodies class I and class II and transfusion of platelets for patients with HLA class I DSA; and 5) blocking the complement cascade. Antibody re-equilibration can occur after plasmapheresis as only 45% of IgG distributes in the intravascular space, while recovery of plasma IgG levels occurs 1–2 weeks after procedure; the administration of high-dose IVIG after plasmapheresis may restore total antibody levels and may help preventing antibody rebound, and most desensitization protocols usually consist of multiple approaches (IVIG, plasmapheresis, rituximab), and plasmapheresis should be followed promptly by conditioning for transplantation to eliminate the source of antibodies.

6 ROADMAP AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

While the goal of the STAR 2019 working group was to provide an up‐to‐date, high stringency, critique of transplant‐related assays used to inform laboratory and nonlaboratory clinicians, it was not meant to discourage them from pursuing best standards of care for their patients. The STAR working group believes that it is imperative for clinicians to have in‐depth understanding of both the value and limitations of the assays in order to be better informed as to how to use the results clinically, in the current time. The need to pause and reexplore the value and wisdom of current practices is the hallmark of improving patient care. The ability to use current knowledge to reevaluate and, if needed, criticize some of the older highly cited works, can provide valuable insights. Only by doing so will our field come together to navigate toward faster future innovations.

We are currently at an intersection between rapid offering of new assays (and better understanding on how to use and interpret currently available ones) and the slow accumulation of prospective transplant outcome data (with the need to have 5‐10 years of follow‐up). Intense efforts by the Transplant Therapeutic Consortium and Paris Transplant Group are seeking to shorten this time through the development of validated surrogate composite endpoints for clinical trials (e.g. iBOX). 124, 125 However, in the interim at this critical juncture, it may require some "out of the box" thinking on how to best use our existing resources. More collaborative efforts and less aversion to retrospective analysis, where samples were collected prospectively in a systematic fashion, should be considered. The past decade had seen many National Institutes of Health–sponsored Clinical Trials in Organ Transplantation, where samples were collected both for testing and biobanked for future use. HLA‐related testing were performed for some of these studies, using best practices for that time, but as recommended by STAR 2017, HLA typing should be performed at a high resolution for both donor and recipient, and antibody testing should use measures to overcome limitations of the SAB assays (e.g. removal of inhibition, etc.), in order to more accurately interpret the data. Further, we now appreciate the need for adjudication of some of the SAB testing rather than using an arbitrary MFI value for a threshold in all cases. Until such efforts take place, the STAR 2019 provide the following recommendation as an immediate call for action (summarized in Figure 2).

Regarding medical management for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, more specifically with respect to management of donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (desensitization therapy), ASTCT 2024 guidelines recommend to recognize that higher donor-specific antibody levels are associated with poor graft function, graft failure, and worse survival. Consider initiating desensitization therapy in patients with a donor-specific antibody level of > 2,000 mean fluorescence intensity in haploidentical and unrelated HSCT and > 1,000 mean fluorescence intensity in cord blood transplantation.

Donor selection for sensitized patients — background guidance notes that the presence of HLA antibodies in heart transplant candidates imposes substantial limitations on the donor pool and can significantly increase waiting time, and that patients exhibiting positive transplantation crossmatch to donor HLA are at high risk for rejection and mortality. The Sensitization in Transplantation Assessment of Risk (STAR) Working Group recommended comprehensive HLA typing, including information regarding major HLA loci: HLA-A, - B, -C, -DRB1, -DRB3/4/5, -DQA1/DQB1, and -DPA1/DPB1 for both the organ donor and recipient. The VXM is recommended to avoid a positive crossmatch; if the VXM cannot be performed or in the event of recent sensitization, a prospective crossmatch is recommended, which can be performed by 2 cell-based methods: a CDC crossmatch assay and a flow cytometric crossmatch assay. Solid-phase immunoassays using flow cytrometry have much greater sensitivity in detecting donor-specific HLA antibodies; however, only the CDC crossmatch detects the killing of cells, and a majority of programs will not accept a donor having a prospective positive flow cytometry crossmatch. It has been suggested to perform a prospective CDC crossmatch when crossing moderate-high binding DSA (defined as MFI > 5,000), and programs crossing high-binding DSA have utilized novel immunosuppression protocols (complement blockade therapy) as long as a prospective CDC crossmatch is negative. Before transplant, some programs may order a surrogate CDC or flow cytometric crossmatch to better assess the ability of DSA to cause harm; if this surrogate CDC crossmatch is negative for cell killing or the flow cytometric crossmatch is moderate or less in strength, then this antibody is not avoided.

HLA-incompatible living donor transplantation — HLA-incompatible transplantation remains the most difficult hurdle in achieving successful transplant outcomes, and pretransplant compatibility crossmatching + or Luminex + complement dependent cytotoxicity- incompatibility may be acceptable with careful management including B-cell-depleting treatments (eg, anti-CD 20 antibody, rituximab) and/or splenectomy and/or intensive immunoglobulin, but increased risk of early rejection remains, requiring additional immunosuppression and attendant risks to the recipient. Although overall survival after HLA-incompatible living donor kidney transplantation is inferior to compatible transplantation, incompatible transplantation after desensitization may offer a substantial survival benefit compared with dialysis or waiting for a deceased donor kidney. A recent study compared 1025 recipients of HLA-incompatible living donor kidney transplants at 22 US medical centers with matched controls; after 8 years, 76.5% of those who received an incompatible living donor transplant were still alive, compared with 62.9% who remained on the waiting list or received a deceased donor transplant and only 43.9% who remained on the waiting list but were never transplanted. HLA-incompatible transplantation does confer additional costs compared with compatible transplantation, but may be cost-effective compared with dialysis; formal cost effectiveness evaluations are needed.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and management of candidates for kidney transplantation [^11389sDR]. Transplantation (2020). High credibility.

KDIGO HLA antibody assays and HLA typing scope — There are two basic assays for detecting HLA antibodies: cytotoxic and solid phase. Cytotoxic assays are both insensitive and non-specific, with frequent false positive results due to irrelevant IgM or non-HLA antibodies, whereas solid phase assays are engineered to specifically detect HLA antibodies and are significantly more sensitive, although far more specific than cytotoxic assays some non-specificity may occur with solid phase assays as well. Where resources permit the use of single antigen bead assays, full delineation of antibody specificities should be performed to permit calculation of a cPRA and compilation of a list of antibody specificities for comparison to all future potential donors. Notwithstanding regulatory requirements of any particular jurisdiction, complete HLA typing by molecular method is optimal; at a minimum, typing should be completed at loci required to interpret any detectable HLA antibodies, and optimally, HLA typing should be completed at all loci (HLA-A, B, C; DRB1, 3, 4, 5; DQA1, DQB1; DPA1, DPB1).

For complement binding single antigen bead assays detecting anti-HLA IgG1/IgG3 that bind C1q or C3d, 'Complement-based assays do not accurately reflect antibody titer', dilution and concentration can change results, and isolated weak/non-complement-binding HLA DSA are 'in the range of 1–5%'.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline on the evaluation and management of candidates for kidney transplantation [^112qsn4p]. Transplantation (2020). High credibility.

Strategies for sensitized candidates — antibody avoidance versus desensitization: For candidates with high cPRA or a living donor barrier (known DSA), offering increased access to a larger donor pool is recommended to increase the chance of finding a DSA-negative donor, and such HLA antibody avoidance is associated with improved graft survival (comparable to unsensitized recipients); when cPRA is very high or few viable donors exist, desensitization should be explored, but no specific desensitization protocol can be recommended, and agents such as rituximab or bortezomib may increase short-term transplant opportunities while being associated with shortened long-term survival depending on antibody strength; compared to remaining on dialysis, desensitization has been associated with improved patient survival in the US but not in the UK, and antibody avoidance is still the preferred strategy where patient characteristics and available resources permit.

Table 1
The benefit of induction therapy in kidney transplantation with tacrolimus, mycophenolic acid, and steroid maintenance treatment

Induction therapy in high‐risk transplants

The advantage of induction therapy appears to be more clear cut in high‐risk kidney transplant recipients. Only two large randomized trials have compared IL2RA versus rATG induction specifically in this setting. Brennan et al recruited 278 patients at high risk of delayed graft function and/or acute rejection based on recipient characteristics such as HLA immunization or donor characteristics such as long cold ischemia time or advanced age 15. Maintenance therapy consisted of CsA, MPA and steroids. In contrast to standard‐risk transplantation, in which acute rejection rates are similar with IL2RA and rATG induction 4, Brennan and colleagues found rejection rates to be almost halved in high‐risk patients given rATG versus IL2RA at 1 year (16% vs. 26%, p = 0.02) and at 5 years (15% vs. 27%, p = 0.03) 16. The severity of acute rejection episodes was also significantly lower with rATG. In another randomized trial, Noël et al enrolled 227 patients at high immunological risk (mean current panel reactive antibodies 35%), of whom almost three‐quarters were receiving a second, third or fourth transplant 17. Maintenance therapy comprised tacrolimus, MPA and steroids. Again, both the incidence and severity of acute rejection were significantly lower with rATG versus IL2RA. The acute rejection rate at 1 year was 15% versus 27% (p = 0.016) 16, a difference that was maintained at 5‐year follow‐up (14% vs. 26%, p = 0.035) 18. The results of these two studies led to the 2009 KDIGO recommendation to use lymphocyte‐depleting induction in patients at high immunological risk 4. Although both studies failed to show a difference in long‐term graft‐ or patient survival benefit with rATG compared with IL2RA 16, 18, lowering the incidence of acute rejection to this extent, given its inherent risks, costs and psychological stress, can still be considered a valid argument for choosing rATG induction in high‐risk transplants.

Figure 2
Call for immediate action: highlights area where progress can be achieved within the near future, or where action is required in order to drive progress

The clinical utility of an assay requires evidence of an improved, measurable, clinical outcome that is directly related to the use of the test; that is, the test should add significant value to patient care. This takes into consideration how the assay is interpreted and how results are reported (positive/negative vs continuous scale) and applied. Unfortunately, while proper evaluation of an assay's clinical utility requires prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs), to date new assays in the field of transplantation report prospective/retrospective observational correlations, at best. In the absence of RCTs, evaluation of clinical utility is inferred based on systematic reviews and/or meta‐analytic approaches.

A systematic review collects, critically appraises, and summarizes the empirical evidence that fits a prespecified eligibility criterion. Meta‐analysis is a statistical approach that assigns a point estimate (of an unknown "common truth") from individual studies and pools results of multiple studies based on a weighted average. Most often, the random‐effects model is used to express heterogeneity across disparate studies. A key benefit of this approach is the accumulation of information to reach higher statistical power. The end result, however, is an estimate of a mean parameter across population‐of‐studies rather than a population of patients. 6, 7 This is especially true in publications assessing HLA antibodies as different studies use different testing methods and criteria to define the presence or absence of those antibodies.

A significant limitation of both systematic reviews and meta‐analysis is "publication bias". 8, 9, 10 It is well established that most manuscripts accepted for publication report on research that shows a significant result, usually in favor of a new treatment/test. "Negative result" submissions are rarely published. Thus, a literature search is fundamentally biased as it is unlikely to identify publications with negative results. Many studies have identification problems arising from imperfections in the internal and external validity of the study, which cannot be fixed by the use of meta‐analysis. It was therefore reported that the relevance of systematic reviews and meta‐analysis to personalized patient care is not evident and cannot replace well‐designed prospective clinical trials. 11 See the call for immediate action in this regard (Figure 2).

### Immunosuppression minimization protocols: how should they be monitored? [^111QrQuH]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2008). Medium credibility.

This Practice Point commentary discusses the experience of Shapiro et al. with renal allograft recipients at a single center who underwent significant minimization of immunosuppressive treatment with alemtuzumab induction and tacrolimus monotherapy (weaned to three times weekly by 1 year after transplantation). Donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) against human leukocyte antigen were monitored after transplantation in some patients. Although 44% of patients did not develop acute rejection or DSAs and had excellent 2-year graft survival (96%), spaced weaning was not attempted in 20% of patients, generally those with early rejection and poor allograft function. During tapering, 20% of patients developed acute rejection and 15% developed DSAs. Two-year graft survival was 63% in patients for whom weaning was not attempted and 78% in patients who experienced acute rejection. Alemtuzumab preconditioning with tacrolimus monotherapy and spaced weaning increased the risk of acute rejection and development of DSAs. Patients should be carefully selected for this protocol and monitored closely for DSAs. Results of a long-term controlled trial that includes protocol biopsies are required to reach more-definitive conclusions.

### BK polyomavirus-associated nephropathy-diagnostic and treatment standard [^114RLsvt]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

These issues are even more important when considering the increasing proportion of patients transplanted across antibody barriers in whom the reduction of immunosuppression is a higher risk manoeuvre, and so potentially less likely to be undertaken. Even when deemed clinically appropriate in this group, such a reduction could reasonably be expected to embed a negative long-term impact on graft function. Caution is also required in patients who are recipients of another transplanted organ. Given all these issues, while undertaking careful immunosuppression reduction remains the mainstay of BKPyVAN management, direct-acting therapies are clearly needed for the most effective management of this patient group.

Evidence about which immunosuppressants to alter in BKPyVAN

Observational studies have reported success with the initial reduction of either antiproliferatives or calcineurin inhibitors. Further stepwise decreases of immunosuppressive burden may be required for patients with high or sustained BKPyV DNAemia. There are several ways this can be performed. Two of the more common strategies involve:

Reduction of calcineurin inhibitor target trough level by 25%–50%, followed by reduction of antiproliferative by 50%, followed by cessation of antiproliferative
Reduction of antiproliferative by 50%, followed by reduction of calcineurin inhibitor target trough by 25%–50%, followed by cessation of antiproliferative

Evidence exists in support of either approach.

Reducing calcineurin inhibitors first

In a prospective study of 644 consecutive KTRs, of whom 105 developed BKPyV DNAemia, a CNI-first reduction strategy resulted in viral clearance in 96% of patients, although it should be noted that 23% of DNAemic participants had < 10⁴ copies/ml, and most were receiving triple immunosuppression with tacrolimus, MMF, and steroids as well as having received induction therapy. KTRs with DNAemia greater than 10⁴ copies/ml or proven BKPyVAN required more extensive reduction of immunosuppression, and a rejection rate of 25% was seen in all study arms. Overall graft outcomes at a median 6.6 years of follow up were comparable to KTRs without DNAemia, although median MDRD eGFR was 10 ml/min less in the BKPyVAN group at viral clearance (reaching statistical significance). This could be considered an earlier outcome measure than graft/patient survival, differences in which require longer follow up to observe. Interestingly, the study cohort contained a significant proportion of transplants across HLA and ABO barriers, with donor-specific antibodies present in 100/644 (17%) of those undergoing screening, and 60/644 (9%) ABO incompatible. Longer-term follow up of this higher risk population would be of great interest.

Heart transplantation — summary of consensus themes underscores holistic, risk-stratified management of antibodies and AMR. The main theme was to adopt a holistic approach and risk-stratify patients, with participants identifying cut-offs to risk stratify and manage pretransplant-detected antibodies and underlining antibodies' attributes as essential adjuncts for risk assessment tools. Special donor considerations and the need to perform a physical prospective crossmatch were discussed, and unmet needs in pediatric and ABO-incompatible heart transplantation were highlighted. Discussants delved into current desensitization approaches, perioperative management, post-transplant antibody monitoring, and maintenance immunosuppression therapy strategies in highly sensitized patients. For post-transplant DSA, participants elaborated on the clinical relevance of DSA including trending characteristics, clinical manifestations, imaging findings, and molecular profiling. Future considerations included organ allocation policies, standardization of HLA reporting, and incorporating DSA in clinical trial end-points, aiming for a more standardized pathway for evaluating patients for heart transplantation and post-transplant monitoring and to pave the way for future studies.

5.8	Vaccine Administration

Immunizations should not be administered in patients who have received RETHYMIC until immune-function criteria have been met.

Inactivated vaccines:

Inactivated vaccines may be administered once all of the following criteria are met:

Immunosuppressive therapies have been discontinued.
Immunoglobulin (IgG) replacement therapy has been discontinued.
The total CD4+T cell count is > 200 cells/mm³and there are more CD4+T cells than CD8+T cells (CD4+ > CD8+).

It is recommended that no more than 2 inactivated vaccines be given per month.

Live Vaccines:

Live virus vaccines should not be administered until patients have met the criteria for inactivated vaccines and received vaccinations with inactivated agents (e.g., tetanus toxoid). No additional vaccines (live or inactivated), except the inactivated influenza vaccine, should be given within 6 months after vaccination with a measles-containing vaccine or within 2 months after the varicella vaccine. Consider verifying response to vaccination with appropriate testing, in particular varicella and measles.

5.9	Anti-HLA Antibodies

All patients should be screened for anti-HLA antibodies prior to receiving RETHYMIC. Patients testing positive for anti-HLA antibodies should receive RETHYMIC from a donor who does not express those HLA alleles.

5.10	HLA Typing

HLA matching is required in patients who have received a prior hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) or a solid organ transplant. Patients who have received a prior HCT are at increased risk of developing GVHD after RETHYMIC if the HCT donor did not fully match the recipient. To minimize this risk, HLA matching of RETHYMIC to recipient alleles that were not expressed in the HCT donor is recommended.

### Antibody-mediated rejection-treatment standard [^117JtVJu]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2025). Medium credibility.

Causal therapy

The approach of treatments aimed at addressing the underlying cause is often preferred; in AMR, this would be targeting the antibodies (Table 2, Fig. 2).

Antibody removal

We recommend DSA removal as a mainstay treatment for early AMR, regardless of whether the DSA is preformed or de novo (although most cases are linked to preexisting DSA, and even cases without detectable preformed DSA may involve donor-specific B cell memory). Antibody removal can be achieved through plasmapheresis, as per the 2019 TTS expert consensus, or through immunoadsorption. The recommendation for plasmapheresis is based on findings from uncontrolled series, although early controlled trials — conducted before clear-cut AMR criteria were established — have yielded conflicting results. Support for immunoadsorption comes from a small trial evaluating protein A-based antibody depletion in severe C4d-positive AMR, which demonstrated a benefit in rejection reversal. However, the authors of this article are aware that the availability of immunoadsorption may be limited and its use not widespread. Moreover, no head-to-head trial comparing different apheresis techniques is currently available. Apheresis sessions may be scheduled daily for the first 3 days, then every 2–3 days over 2–3 weeks. The additional use of IVIG can be considered, but it has weak supporting evidence, although a retrospective study suggested potential benefit. For pathophysiologic considerations, we recommend using high-dose IVIG at the end of the apheresis course (e.g. 2 g/kg), rather than low doses after each treatment session. The concept of (transient) antibody depletion may have limitations, as demonstrated by a recent trial comparing the IgG-cleaving enzyme imlifidase with plasmapheresis plus IVIG. In this trial, imlifidase — established as a therapeutic option for desensitization of highly sensitized transplant recipients — did not demonstrate an advantage over plasmapheresis in the treatment of AMR, despite a demonstrated profound impact on DSA levels. Notably, despite adjunctive treatment with steroids and rituximab, neither approach led to a meaningful reduction in MVI on follow-up biopsies. Without an untreated control group, however, the true impact on rejection activity and progression remains unclear.

### Effect of immunosuppressive drugs on humoral allosensitization after kidney transplant [^112t8Fwr]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2016). Low credibility.

The negative effect of donor-specific antibodies on the success of solid transplant is now clearly established. However, the lack of effective treatment to prevent the development of antibody-mediated lesions deepens the need for clinicians to focus on primary prevention of de novo humoral allosensitization. Among the factors associated with the risk of developing de novo donor-specific antibodies, therapeutic immunosuppression is the most obvious parameter in which improvement is possible. Beyond compliance and the overall depth of immunosuppression, it is likely that the nature of the drugs is also crucial. Here, we provide an overview of the molecular effect of the various immunosuppressive drugs on B cell biology. Clinical data related to the effect of these drugs on de novo humoral allosensitization are also examined, providing a platform from which clinicians can optimize immunosuppression for prevention of de novo donor-specific antibody generation at the individual level.

1 INTRODUCTION

Patients undergoing kidney transplantation are subject to an array of side effects and complications associated with the immunosuppressive therapies required for successful engraftment of the organ. The amount of immunosuppression needed is largely dependent upon the underlying immunologic risk of the patient. Currently, the assessment of this risk relies on a collection of demographic or clinical variables that often lack precision, including age, ethnicity, sensitization, type of donor kidney, and whole antigen mismatch. 1 Consequently, most decisions about induction therapy and maintenance immunosuppression are dictated by center protocol rather than the immunologic risk profile of a given patient, with subsequent changes to the maintenance regimen carried out only after complications have occurred (eg, infection, neurotoxicity, diarrhea, etc.). 2, 3 In an effort to reduce drug toxicities, some centers have advocated for minimizing exposure to tacrolimus, the most important therapy for maintenance immunosuppression in clinical practice. However, there is now a growing body of evidence suggesting this strategy may be associated with de novo donor‐specific antibody (DSA) development. 4, 5, 6 The appearance of DSA, particularly those specific for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)‐DR and ‐DQ loci, frequently evolves into chronic antibody‐mediated rejection, a leading cause of renal allograft loss. 7

Tissue matching is central to understanding a given patient's immunologic risk, as evidenced by the low immunosuppressive requirement and excellent prognosis of a kidney from a sibling that is a two haplotype HLA match. However, traditional whole antigen matching at HLA‐A, ‐B, and ‐DR is only a modest predictor of adverse clinical outcomes, as a binary "match" or "mismatch" at any given HLA loci can drastically overlook similarities or differences between recipient and donor tissue at the molecular level of the HLA molecule. Small clusters of amino acids on the surface of HLA molecules referred to as "eplets" can now be compared between donor and recipient tissues in order to quantify differences in a more precise way. 8 Preliminary evidence in a single cohort of Canadian patients demonstrated that HLA‐DR/DQ molecular mismatch thresholds could be used to risk stratify patients into groups that are at low, intermediate, and high risk for the development of HLA Class II antibodies. 9

The ability to personalize management for a given transplant recipient and thereby optimize their long‐term outcome remains a critical unmet need. Indeed, the majority of variance in the choice of induction or maintenance therapy is based on center‐specific practices rather than on the traditional risk factors offered in practice guidelines. 1, 2 By comparison, other medical fields are realizing major advances in the development of diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers enabling individualized therapeutic and monitoring strategies while avoiding futile treatments with their associated toxicities.

In 2017, the STAR Working Group was launched by the American Society of Transplantation (AST) and American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics (ASHI) to address these unmet needs by evaluating (1) the prognostic utility of laboratory assays to precisely characterize an individual's alloimmune risk and (2) the predictive utility of laboratory assays to guide therapeutic decisions for the individual before transplant.

The STAR 2017 report 3 highlighted the marked variability among centers for defining and assigning a level of alloimmune risk for a given donor/recipient pair. In part this is due to the misuse, and lack, of standardized terminology, and the varying interpretation of clinical assays without rigorous proof of the claims being asserted. STAR provided a primer to bring clarity and accuracy to alloimmune risk definitions and terminology. The STAR 2017 report also created a framework and identified the need for every donor/recipient pair to be assigned 2 independent risk assessments: 1 for alloimmune memory and 1 for primary alloimmunity. This framework is intended to serve as a basis for precision therapeutic strategies.

The STAR 2019 Working Group's goal was to further expand on the expectations, limitations, perceptions, and actual utility of available alloimmune assays that are currently in use or in development to precisely evaluate alloimmune risk. Along with critically reviewing biologically driven, state‐of‐the‐art, clinical diagnostics literature by experts in the field, the STAR 2019 workshop was open for public participation, to allow broader engagement of the AST and ASHI membership. High‐level summary and recommendations is presented in Figure 1. To facilitate discussion on the clinical utility of current assays, this report provides a primer on the requirements set forth by Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA), College of American Pathologists, and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for qualification as a "clinical‐grade" assay or biomarkers.

### The management of antibodies in heart transplantation: an ISHLT consensus document [^113g57YF]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2018). Medium credibility.

ISHLT consensus on antibodies in heart transplantation — antibodies remain a serious cause of morbidity and mortality for patients both before and after heart transplantation, and the presence of circulating antibodies in heart transplantation (called sensitization) impacts clinical outcomes. Patients awaiting transplant who possess antibodies against human leukocyte antigen are disadvantaged by having to wait longer to receive an organ from a suitably matched donor, and the number of pre-sensitized patients has been increasing, a trend that is likely due to the increased use of mechanical circulatory support devices. Even patients who are not pre-sensitized can go on to produce donor-specific antibodies after transplant, which are associated with worse outcomes. The difficulty in managing antibodies is uncertainty over which antibodies are of clinical relevance, which patients to treat, and which treatments are most effective and safe, and there is a distinct lack of data from prospective trials. An international consensus conference was organized and attended by 103 participants from 75 centers to debate contentious issues, determine the best practices, and formulate ideas for future research on antibodies.

### Sensitization in transplantation: assessment of risk (STAR) 2017 working group meeting report [^114FedJ8]. American Journal of Transplantation (2018). Low credibility.

The presence of preexisting (memory) or de novo donor-specific HLA antibodies (DSAs) is a known barrier to successful long-term organ transplantation. Yet, despite the fact that laboratory tools and our understanding of histocompatibility have advanced significantly in recent years, the criteria to define presence of a DSA and assign a level of risk for a given DSA vary markedly between centers. A collaborative effort between the American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics and the American Society of Transplantation provided the logistical support for generating a dedicated multidisciplinary working group, which included experts in histocompatibility as well as kidney, liver, heart, and lung transplantation. The goals were to perform a critical review of biologically driven, state-of-the-art, clinical diagnostics literature and to provide clinical practice recommendations based on expert assessment of quality and strength of evidence. The results of the Sensitization in Transplantation: Assessment of Risk (STAR) meeting are summarized here, providing recommendations on the definition and utilization of HLA diagnostic testing, and a framework for clinical assessment of risk for a memory or a primary alloimmune response. The definitions, recommendations, risk framework, and highlighted gaps in knowledge are intended to spur research that will inform the next STAR Working Group meeting in 2019.

Management of sensitized transplant candidates — when access is reduced by high calculated panel reactive antibody (cPRA) or known donor-specific antibody (DSA), 'offering increased access to a larger donor pool… is recommended to increase the chance of finding a DSA-negative donor', and such HLA antibody avoidance 'is associated with improved graft survival (comparable to unsensitized recipients) in comparison to transplantation with DSA present'. For very high cPRA or limited donors, 'desensitization should be explored as an option to achieve transplantation'. Regional data are mixed; 'No specific desensitization protocol can be recommended', and approaches including 'anti-B cell agents (eg, rituximab), proteasome inhibitors (eg, bortezomib)… may increase transplant opportunities in the short term, but… can be associated with shortened long-term survival' Accordingly, 'antibody avoidance is still the preferred strategy where patient characteristics and available resources permit'.

### Renal association clinical practice guideline in post-operative care in the kidney transplant recipient [^116g2E8D]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Guideline 3.1 – KTR: induction immunosuppression

We recommend induction therapy should take into account the following:
Immunosuppressive drugs should be started before or at the time of renal transplantation (1B)
Induction therapy with biological agents should be administered to all KTRs (1B). In patients at low immunological risk this will generally involve an interleukin-2 receptor antagonist (IL2-RA). Recipients at higher immunological risk may be considered for T-cell (lymphocyte) Depleting Antibodies (TDAs; e.g. anti-lymphocyte preparations [antithymocyte globulin (ATG) or alemtuzumab])
Induction therapy with TDAs may also be useful for lower immunological risk patients with the intention of either steroid or CNI avoidance (1C)

Guideline 3.2 – KTR: induction immunosuppression

We suggest that a CNI should be started at the time of transplantation and not delayed until the graft is functioning (2C)

### Managing the highly sensitized transplant recipient and B cell tolerance [^1173eS45]. Current Opinion in Immunology (2001). Low credibility.

The detection of anti-donor-HLA antibodies in a renal allograft recipient's serum, either at the time of or after transplantation, is usually associated with specific antibody-mediated clinical syndromes. These can be divided temporally into three categories: hyperacute rejection, acute humoral rejection and chronic humoral rejection. With the identification of new immunosuppressive drug combinations, more-effective control of alloantibody production has been recently achieved in humans. Thus, prevention and/or treatment of antibody-mediated allograft injury are now possible. Ultimately, the induction of mixed hematopoietic chimerism may allow us to overcome the problem of allosensitization and accept an allograft without chronic immunosuppression.

### ASTCT consensus recommendations on testing and treatment of patients with donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies [^1139gjDC]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, more specifically with respect to stem cell transplantation (management of donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies, desensitization therapy), ASTCT 2024 guidelines recommend to recognize that higher donor-specific antibody levels are associated with poor graft function, graft failure, and worse survival. Consider initiating desensitization therapy in patients with a donor-specific antibody level of > 2,000 mean fluorescence intensity in haploidentical and unrelated HSCT and > 1,000 mean fluorescence intensity in cord blood transplantation.

DSA and the diagnosis of ABMR

Terasaki et al identified HLA antibodies in the serum of patients after transplantation nearly 45 years ago. However, the importance of a low-strength antibody that is undetectable by cell-based methodology was not recognized until studies from the same group, three decades later, discovered a strong association between HLA antibodies detected by solid-phase assays and graft failure.

DSA may be directed against HLA or other endothelial cell antigens, and its presence is required for the diagnosis of acute and chronic active ABMR. In addition, there is growing evidence supporting the roles of preformed and de novo DSA as independent risk factors for acute and chronic ABMR and graft loss. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrated that the presence of DSA before transplantation was associated with a twofold greater risk of acute rejection and a 75% greater risk of graft loss. Despite these findings, our understanding of the biological relevance of DSA remains limited. In vitro studies suggest that anti-HLA class I alloantibodies result in endothelial cell injury and activation through both complement-dependent and complement-independent pathways. However, little is known about signal transduction in response to class II antibodies or the pathogenesis of DSA-induced renal allograft injury in actual patients. It is important to note that not all DSA fix complement or cause ABMR and, conversely, not all episodes of acute graft injury with capillary inflammation and C4d deposition are associated with DSA being detectable with standard assays. In fact, the majority of patients with DSA maintain normal kidney function for years and have long-term outcomes similar to nonsensitized patients.

Another important limitation is that currently available HLA antibody tests are qualitative and have not been cleared by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for quantitative measurements. More studies are needed to identify risk stratification strategies on the basis of semiquantitative measures of DSA and calculated panel reactive antibody (PRA), subclasses of immunoglobulin G anti-HLA antibodies, and C1q complement-fixing DSA. Pending the results of collaborative standardization studies, consensus guidelines on the testing and clinical management issues associated with HLA and non-HLA antibodies in transplantation were recently published. These recommendations are intended to provide guidance on the use and clinical application of contemporary methods for HLA antibody detection.

Regarding medical management for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, more specifically with respect to management of donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (follow-up), ASTCT 2024 guidelines recommend to obtain repeated donor-specific antibody testing within 2 weeks of starting the conditioning regimen in transplant recipients with a previous history of low-level donor-specific antibodies (< 2,000 mean fluorescence intensity in haploidentical HSCT and < 1,000 mean fluorescence intensity in single cord blood transplantation) at high risk of increased donor-specific antibody levels, such as receiving multiple units of blood transfusion or granulocyte infusion.

Preventing ABMR

More than 20 000 patients awaiting kidney transplantation in the United States are sensitized (typically owing to blood transfusion, pregnancy or previous transplants) to HLA class I and/or class II antibodies. Until recently, transplantation was routinely avoided in sensitized patients, at the expense of prolonging waiting time for suitably HLA-matched organs. However, with the advent of virtual crossmatch, desensitization protocols and paired kidney exchange (PKE) programs, timely kidney transplantation has become a reality for many of these high-risk patients,(Table 2). Highly sensitized patients may be able to participate in special programs such as the Eurotransplant Acceptable Mismatch Program, in which the HLA typing of panel donors with negative reactions is determined during screening if PRA is below 100%; alternatively, selection and crossmatching of blood donors with a single HLA mismatch to the patient's phenotype can be undertaken. It has been argued that implementation of these programs may lead to similar graft survival rates to those observed in nonsensitized patients.

Strategies to prevent ABMR

Prevention of acute ABMR phenotype 1

Only one randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) has been conducted to lower allosensitization prior to transplantation. In this study, 101 adult patients with a PRA ≥ 50% were enrolled in a trial sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. Patients received intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 2 g/kg monthly for 4 months or an equivalent volume of placebo with additional infusions at 12 and 24 months after entry if not transplanted while on IVIG or placebo. IVIG significantly reduced PRA levels in study subjects compared with placebo, and more patients in the IVIG arm were transplanted (35% vs. 17%). Seven graft failures occurred (four IVIG, three placebo) among adherent patients with similar 2-year graft survival rates (80% IVIG, 75% placebo). The investigators concluded that IVIG is better than placebo in reducing anti-HLA antibody levels and improving transplantation rates in highly sensitized patients with end-stage renal disease. In a follow-up study by the same group, the combination of B cell depletion therapy and high-dose IVIG was shown to be effective in reducing PRA from 77 ± 18% to 44 ± 30% at the time of transplantation. However, recent studies have not been able to reproduce these data, specifically in patients with PRA > 80%–.

### ASTCT consensus recommendations on testing and treatment of patients with donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies [^112qd8HN]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Regarding therapeutic procedures for chronic lymphocytic leukemia, more specifically with respect to stem cell transplantation (management of donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies, desensitization therapy), ASTCT 2024 guidelines recommend to consider administering donor-specific antibodies desensitization therapy to promote hematopoietic engraftment and potentially improve survival in recipients with donor-specific antibodies when a suitable alternative donor without the corresponding HLA is unavailable.

### Presensitization: the problem and its management [^114RosHJ]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Much attention has been placed recently on transplantation in highly HLA-sensitized patients. In attempts to remove these antibodies and enable successful transplantation, several novel approaches have been developed. These include intravenous Ig (IVIg), mycophenolate mofetil, sirolimus, alemtuzumab, protein A immunoabsorption, and rituximab. IVIg has emerged as a very effective agent when used alone in high dose or when used in low dose and combined with plasmapheresis. Although alemtuzumab has been used to eliminated B cells, it fails to prevent antibody-mediated rejection and therefore probably is not suitable for desensitization. Rituximab, a B cell-specific antibody, seems to be safe and to have some efficacy as a sole agent in elimination of alloantibodies but most likely will require combination therapy with IVIg or other agents. Newer agents, such as humanized anti-CD20, are being developed. Despite the great interest in the problem of allosensitization, with one notable exception, there is a major deficiency in controlled clinical trials, the conduct of which should be a focus for the near future.

### KDIGO 2025 clinical practice guideline for the management of nephrotic syndrome in children [^112zSjE6]. Kidney International (2025). High credibility.

Section 19: immunological assessment — sensitizing events, antibody testing, and typing specify the following: Communicate all sensitizing events or clinical events that can impact panel reactive antibody (PRA) to the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) laboratory (Not Graded). Perform HLA antibody testing at transplant evaluation, at regular intervals prior to transplantation and after a sensitizing event or a clinical event that can impact PRA (Not Graded). We recommend that HLA antibody testing be performed using solid phase assays (1B). We recommend HLA typing of candidates at evaluation using molecular methods, optimally at all loci (1D). We suggest not routinely testing candidates for non-HLA antibodies (2C). We suggest not routinely testing candidates for complement-binding HLA antibodies (2C). We suggest informing candidates about their access to transplantation based on blood type and histocompatibility testing results (2C). We recommend offering candidates with immunologically-reduced access to transplant access to a larger deceased donor pool, kidney exchange programs, and/or desensitization (1C). We suggest that antibody avoidance (eg, kidney exchange programs or deceased donor acceptable mismatch allocation) be considered before desensitization (2C).

### Precision medicine in transplantation and hemodialysis [^114wHmL9]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2021). Medium credibility.

In kidney transplantation, precision medicine has already entered clinical practice. Donor and recipient human leucocyte antigen (HLA) regions are genotyped in two class 1 and usually three class 2 loci, and the individual degree of sensitization against alloimmune antigens is evaluated by the detection of anti-HLA donor-specific antibodies. Recently, the contribution of non-HLA mismatches to outcomes such as acute T- and B-cell-mediated rejection and even long-term graft survival was described. Tracking of specific alloimmune T- and B-cell clones by next generation sequencing and refinement of the immunogenicity of allo-epitopes specifically in the interaction with HLA and T- and B-cell receptors may further support individualized therapy. Although the choices of maintenance immunosuppression are rather limited, individualization can be accomplished by adjustment of dosing based on these risk predictors. Finally, supplementing histopathology by a transcriptomics analysis allows for a biological interpretation of the histological findings and avoids interobserver variability of results. In contrast to transplantation, the prescription of hemodialysis therapy is far from precise. Guidelines do not consider modifications by age, diet or many comorbid conditions. Patients with residual kidney function routinely receive the same treatment as those without. A major barrier hitherto is the definition of 'adequate' treatment based on urea removal. Kt/Vurea and related parameters neither reflect the severity of uremic symptoms nor predict long-term outcomes. Urea is poorly representative for numerous other compounds that accumulate in the body when the kidneys fail, yet clinicians prescribe treatment based on its measurement. Modern technology has provided the means to identify other solutes responsible for specific features of uremic illness and their measurement will be a necessary step in moving beyond the standardized prescription of hemodialysis.

### ASTCT consensus recommendations on testing and treatment of patients with donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies [^114jasSm]. Transplantation and Cellular Therapy (2024). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for T-cell/natural killer-cell lymphoma, more specifically with respect to management of donor-specific anti-HLA antibodies (desensitization therapy), ASTCT 2024 guidelines recommend to administer multimodality pre-transplant desensitization to decrease donor-specific antibodies.

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Donor-specific antibodies ≤ 20,000 mean fluorescence intensity|- Administer plasmapheresis, rituximab, IVIG, and infusion of donor-derived HLA, either irradiated buffy coat for the corresponding HLA class I and II or platelet transfusions for corresponding HLA class I only|
|Donor-specific antibodies > 20,000 mean fluorescence intensity|- Consider performing antibody titration due to bead saturation, and select an alternative donor without corresponding HLA, or consider treating using an investigational approach|
|Donor-specific antibodies 2,000–10,000 mean fluorescence intensity in haploidentical HSCT or 1,000–10,000 mean fluorescence intensity in cord blood transplantation|- Insufficient evidence to support the use of a lower intensity desensitization protocol, such as rituximab with IVIG.|
