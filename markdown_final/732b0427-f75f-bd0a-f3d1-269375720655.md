## Question

What are the most common non-opioid analgesics used for acute pain management?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which non-opioid analgesics are most commonly used for acute pain management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the highest-credibility guidelines to anchor what is considered first-line. Then, I should verify which specific non-opioid classes and agents are repeatedly emphasized across sources. Next, I will check for any emerging non-opioid options that might be considered "common" in current practice. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, prioritized list with supporting references and note any nuances or exceptions that could modify choices in real-world care.

> Let me first confirm the foundational guidance. Multiple high-credibility sources converge on the same first-line non-opioid classes: NSAIDs and acetaminophen, with topical NSAIDs favored for localized musculoskeletal pain and oral NSAIDs or acetaminophen for systemic therapy, and both used within a multimodal framework when appropriate [^4b3e476a] [^c7d0e20e] [^f32be459] [^0d375d28].

> Wait, let me verify the specific agents most frequently cited. Across emergency medicine and primary care guidance, ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, and ketoprofen are repeatedly listed as commonly used NSAIDs, with ibuprofen and naproxen appearing most often in outpatient contexts, while diclofenac is frequently used topically for soft-tissue injuries and orally for inflammatory pain. Ketorolac is commonly used parenterally in ED and perioperative settings for short-term use [^a6cf5d07] [^c7d0e20e] [^799ccce4].

> I need to check acetaminophen's role and formulations. Oral acetaminophen remains a staple first-line agent for mild-to-moderate pain and is often paired with NSAIDs for additive effect; intravenous acetaminophen is commonly used in ED and perioperative settings for faster onset and opioid-sparing benefit, with evidence of meaningful analgesia at 30 minutes in ED populations [^05c7b9b0] [^799ccce4] [^c7d0e20e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "most common" without considering topical options. For acute soft-tissue injuries, topical NSAIDs such as diclofenac gel are strongly recommended and often preferred over oral NSAIDs when feasible due to favorable local effect and lower systemic risk, which makes them among the most commonly used non-opioid options in localized musculoskeletal pain [^4d2bc816] [^1526697d] [^0d375d28].

> I should confirm whether any newer non-opioid classes are already "common" in practice. Suzetrigine (a selective NaV1.8 inhibitor) was recently FDA-approved for moderate-to-severe acute pain and represents a promising non-opioid alternative, but given its novelty, it is not yet "most common" in routine practice, though it may become more prevalent as access and experience grow [^eddb1ea9] [^29230181].

> Let me synthesize the hierarchy. The most common non-opioid analgesics for acute pain management, in order of frequency and guideline emphasis, are: 1) NSAIDs, including oral ibuprofen and naproxen, topical diclofenac, and parenteral ketorolac in appropriate settings; 2) acetaminophen, both oral and intravenous; 3) topical NSAIDs as a distinct, frequently used modality for localized pain. These choices align with first-line recommendations across AAFP, CDC, EUSEM, and ACP/AAFP guidance and reflect current multimodal, opioid-sparing practice patterns [^4b3e476a] [^f32be459] [^a6cf5d07] [^0d375d28].

> But wait, what if the pain phenotype or patient risk profile changes the calculus? I should double-check that NSAIDs are avoided in those with GI bleeding risk, renal disease, or cardiovascular contraindications, and that acetaminophen dose is reduced in hepatic disease; in such cases, topical NSAIDs or acetaminophen monotherapy may be prioritized, and nonpharmacologic measures intensified, which reinforces why these agents are the backbone of non-opioid care while still requiring individualized selection [^c7d0e20e] [^8788de67].

---

The most common non-opioid analgesics for acute pain are **NSAIDs** (ibuprofen, naproxen, diclofenac, ketorolac) and **acetaminophen**, with topical NSAIDs preferred for localized musculoskeletal pain [^4d2bc816] [^1526697d]. NSAIDs are **first-line for inflammatory pain** (dental, musculoskeletal, renal colic) [^476dd4ec] [^0d4fb8fb] and acetaminophen is preferred when NSAIDs are contraindicated or for mild pain [^c7d0e20e]. Multimodal regimens combining NSAIDs and acetaminophen are recommended to optimize analgesia and reduce opioid use [^867cc6e6] [^799ccce4]. Emerging options like suzetrigine (NaV1.8 inhibitor) are promising for moderate-to-severe acute pain but are not yet first-line [^eddb1ea9] [^29230181].

---

## Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

NSAIDs are the **cornerstone of non-opioid acute pain management** because of their anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties [^0d4fb8fb]. They inhibit cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, thereby reducing prostaglandin synthesis and inflammation [^d538c7f2].

---

### Commonly used NSAIDs

| **Medication** | **Route of administration** | **Common indications** |
|-|-|-|
| Ibuprofen | Oral, IV | - Musculoskeletal pain <br/> - Dental pain <br/> - Mild-to-moderate acute pain |
| Naproxen | Oral | - Musculoskeletal pain <br/> - Dental pain <br/> - Mild-to-moderate acute pain |
| Diclofenac | Oral, topical, IV | - Localized musculoskeletal pain <br/> - Soft tissue injuries <br/> - Renal colic |
| Ketorolac | IV, IM | - Moderate-to-severe acute pain <br/> - Postoperative pain <br/> - Renal colic |

---

NSAIDs are **particularly effective for inflammatory pain conditions** such as dental pain, musculoskeletal injuries, and renal colic [^0d4fb8fb]. They are also recommended as first-line therapy for acute dental pain and renal colic due to their superior efficacy and favorable safety profile compared to opioids [^476dd4ec] [^0d4fb8fb].

---

### Safety considerations

NSAIDs are associated with gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal risks, particularly with prolonged use or in patients with pre-existing conditions. Clinicians should assess patient risk factors and use the **lowest effective dose for the shortest duration** [^c7d0e20e] [^8788de67].

---

## Acetaminophen (paracetamol)

Acetaminophen is a widely used non-opioid analgesic with antipyretic properties. It is **preferred for patients with contraindications to NSAIDs**, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiovascular disease, or renal impairment [^c7d0e20e]. Acetaminophen is effective for mild-to-moderate acute pain and is often used in combination with NSAIDs for multimodal analgesia [^c7d0e20e] [^799ccce4].

---

### Safety considerations

Acetaminophen is generally well tolerated; however, **hepatotoxicity can occur with overdose or chronic use**, particularly in patients with liver disease or alcohol use disorder. Clinicians should adhere to recommended dosing limits and monitor liver function in high-risk patients [^c7d0e20e] [^8788de67].

---

## Topical NSAIDs

Topical NSAIDs, such as diclofenac gel, are **effective for localized musculoskeletal pain** and soft tissue injuries [^1526697d]. They provide analgesia comparable to oral NSAIDs with significantly reduced systemic adverse effects, making them a preferred option for localized pain [^1526697d].

---

## Emerging non-opioid analgesics

Recent developments include **suzetrigine**, a selective NaV1.8 sodium channel inhibitor approved for moderate-to-severe acute pain [^eddb1ea9]. Suzetrigine offers a novel mechanism of action distinct from traditional NSAIDs and acetaminophen, providing effective analgesia with a favorable safety profile [^29230181]. However, further research is needed to establish its role in routine clinical practice [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current clinical guidelines emphasize a **multimodal approach** to acute pain management, prioritizing non-opioid analgesics such as NSAIDs and acetaminophen [^f32be459]. The CDC recommends maximizing the use of nonpharmacologic and non-opioid pharmacologic therapies before considering opioids for acute pain [^f32be459]. Similarly, the AAFP recommends NSAIDs, acetaminophen, or a combination as initial therapy for acute pain syndromes [^4b3e476a].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **NSAIDs**: First-line for inflammatory acute pain conditions, including dental pain, musculoskeletal injuries, and renal colic [^476dd4ec] [^0d4fb8fb].
- **Acetaminophen**: Preferred for mild-to-moderate acute pain, particularly in patients with contraindications to NSAIDs [^c7d0e20e].
- **Topical NSAIDs**: Effective for localized musculoskeletal pain with minimal systemic adverse effects [^1526697d].
- **Multimodal analgesia**: Combination of NSAIDs and acetaminophen recommended for optimal analgesia and opioid-sparing effect [^867cc6e6] [^799ccce4].

---

NSAIDs and acetaminophen are the **most common non-opioid analgesics** for acute pain, with topical NSAIDs favored for localized pain. Emerging agents like suzetrigine offer promising alternatives but are not yet first-line. Multimodal regimens combining NSAIDs and acetaminophen are recommended to optimize pain control and minimize opioid use.

Pain management is a core competency of hospital medicine, and effective acute pain management should be a goal for all hospital medicine providers. The prevalence of opioid use in the United States, both therapeutic and non-medical in origin, has dramatically increased over the past decade. Although nonopioid medications and nondrug treatments are essential components of managing all acute pain, opioids continue to be the mainstay of treatment for severe acute pain in both opioid-naïve and opioid-dependent patients. In this review, we provide an evidence-based approach to appropriate and safe use of opioid analgesics in treating acute pain in hospitalized patients who are opioid-dependent.

### Causes and consequences of inadequate management of acute pain [^3d2304b2]. Pain Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Context

Intense acute pain afflicts millions of patients each year. Despite the recently increased focus on the importance of pain control, management of acute pain has remained suboptimal.

Objective

The objective of this study was to identify through a review of recent literature the barriers to effective treatment of acute pain and the potential consequences of inadequate pain management.

Design

A comprehensive literature review was conducted to identify articles relevant to the management of acute pain. Information regarding the underlying causes of inadequate pain management, as well as the sequelae associated with undermanaged pain was extracted and summarized.

Results

Studies indicate that treatment of acute pain remains suboptimal due to attitudes and educational barriers on the part of both physicians and patients, as well as the intrinsic limitations of available therapies. Inadequate management of acute pain negatively impacts numerous aspects of patient health, and may increase the risk of developing chronic pain. Although opioids are the preferred treatment for most moderate to severe acute pain, their side effects can impede their use, and thus, their clinical effectiveness. Analgesic regimens with an improved efficacy/tolerability balance have the potential to improve acute pain management, and thus reduce the incidence of chronic pain. Studies examining the use of multiple analgesics with different mechanisms of action suggest that multimodal therapies may offer an improved efficacy/tolerability balance over single agent regimens.

Conclusions

There exists a significant need for effective, well-tolerated analgesic therapies to limit the negative consequences of undermanaged acute pain. The use of multimodal therapy has demonstrated increasing promise and is supported by current practice guidelines.

### Moving toward a multimodal analgesic regimen for acute sickle cell pain with non-opioid analgesic adjuncts: a narrative review [^5498934a]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose of Review

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy with potential life-threatening complications that affect millions of people worldwide. Severe and disabling acute pain, referred to as a vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), is a fundamental symptom of the disease and the primary driver for acute care visits and hospitalizations. Despite the publication of guidelines for VOC management over the past decade, management of VOCs remains unsatisfactory for patients and providers.

Recent Findings

Acute SCD pain includes pain secondary to VOCs and other forms of acute pain. Distinguishing VOC from non-VOC pain may be challenging for both patients and clinicians. Further, although opioids have been the gold-standard for VOC pain management for decades, the current highest standard of care for all acute pain is a multimodal approach that is less dependent on opioids, and, instead incorporates analgesics and adjuvants from different mechanistic pathways. In this narrative review, we focus on a multimodal pharmacologic approach for acute SCD pain management and explore the evidence for existing non-opioid pharmacological adjuncts. Moreover, we present an explanatory model of pain, which is not only novel in its application to SCD pain but also captures the multidimensional nature of the SCD pain experience and supports the need for such a multimodal approach. This model also highlights opportunities for new investigative and therapeutic targets – both pharmacological and non-pharmacological.

Summary

Multimodal pain regimens that are less dependent on opioids are urgently needed to improve acute pain outcomes for individuals with SCD. The proposed explanatory model for SCD pain offers novel opportunities to improve acute pain management for SCD patients.

Regarding medical management for acute pain, more specifically with respect to non-opioid analgesics, NSAIDs, EUSEM 2020 guidelines recommend to recognize that COX-2 inhibitors are used only in a few countries across Europe for the management of acute pain, reflecting perhaps the limited evidence for their use in this setting. Recognize that celecoxib 200 or 400 mg has been suggested to be as effective as ibuprofen 600 mg
in patients with musculoskeletal pain, which suggests that its use is limited in preference to ibuprofen; and parecoxib has demonstrated comparable efficacy to ketoprofen in patients with renal colic
, and IV morphine in patients with abdominal pain.

### Nonopioid therapies for pain management… [^f522c952]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute pain Nonopioid therapies are at least as effective as opioids for many common types of acute pain. Clinicians should maximize use of nonpharmacologic and nonopioid therapies as appropriate for the specific condition and patient and only consider opioid therapy for acute pain if benefits are anticipated to outweigh risks to the patient. Many acute pain conditions can often be managed most effectively with nonopioid medications. Noninvasive and nonpharmacologic approaches to acute pain also have the potential to improve pain and function without risk for serious harms. Clinicians can consider using nonopioid therapies to treat common types of acute pain including:

- Low back or neck pain
- Dental pain
- Kidney stone pain
- Pain related to musculoskeletal injuries
- Pain related to minor surgeries typically associated with minimal tissue injury and mild postoperative pain
- Headaches, including episodic migraine. Nonopioid treatment options for acute pain Nonpharmacologic pain therapies
- Ice
- Heat
- Elevation
- Rest
- Immobilization
- Exercise Nonopioid medications
- Topical or oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
- Acetaminophen
- Triptans, antiemetics, and dihydroergotamine for migraine Refer to Recommendation 1 in the 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for additional information and examples of nonopioid therapies to treat acute pain.
- Low-level laser therapy
- Acupuncture
- Massage
- Spinal manipulation Exercise, mind-body interventions, and behavioral treatments can encourage active patient participation in the care plan and help address the effects of pain in the patient's life. Nonopioid medications Several nonopioid pharmacologic therapies can be used for subacute and chronic pain conditions. Some examples include:

- Topical and oral NSAIDs
- Acetaminophen
- Tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants
- Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor antidepressants
- Anticonvulsants
- Capsaicin and lidocaine patches.

### Approaching acute pain in emergency settings; European Society for Emergency Medicine (EUSEM) guidelines-part 2: management and recommendations [^50740258]. Internal and Emergency Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute pain, more specifically with respect to non-opioid analgesics (acetaminophen), EUSEM 2020 guidelines recommend to recognize that pain management with PO acetaminophen in patients with acute blunt minor musculoskeletal extremity trauma,
traumatic or inflammatory pain to the extremities when used in combination with codeine,
acute musculoskeletal pain,
and pain caused by ankle sprain
is at least as effective as with NSAIDs; and IV acetaminophen has similar analgesic effects to IV morphine in patients with isolated limb trauma.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^88c280fd]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Acute, subacute, and chronic pain needs to be appropriately assessed and treated independent of whether opioids are part of a treatment regimen.
Recommendations are voluntary and are intended to support, not supplant, individualized, person-centered care. Flexibility to meet the care needs and the clinical circumstances of a specific patient is paramount.
A multimodal and multidisciplinary approach to pain management attending to the physical health, behavioral health, long-term services and supports, and expected health outcomes and well-being of each person is critical.
Special attention should be given to avoid misapplying this clinical practice guideline beyond its intended use or implementing policies purportedly derived from it that might lead to unintended and potentially harmful consequences for patients.
Clinicians, practices, health systems, and payers should vigilantly attend to health inequities; provide culturally and linguistically appropriate communication, including communication that is accessible to persons with disabilities; and ensure access to an appropriate, affordable, diversified, coordinated, and effective nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic pain management regimen for all persons.

Determining Whether or Not to Initiate Opioids for Pain

All patients with pain should receive treatment that provides the greatest benefits relative to risks. (See Recommendation 1 for determining whether or not to initiate opioids for acute pain [i.e. pain lasting < 1 month] and Recommendation 2 for determining whether or not to initiate opioids for subacute pain [i.e. pain lasting 1–3 months] or chronic pain [i.e. pain lasting > 3 months].)

Recommendation 1

Nonopioid therapies are at least as effective as opioids for many common types of acute pain. Clinicians should maximize use of nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic therapies as appropriate for the specific condition and patient and only consider opioid therapy for acute pain if benefits are anticipated to outweigh risks to the patient. Before prescribing opioid therapy for acute pain, clinicians should discuss with patients the realistic benefits and known risks of opioid therapy (recommendation category: B; evidence type: 3).

### Suzetrigine approval breaks a 25-year silence: a new era in non-opioid acute pain management [^d538c7f2]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Pain is the most common reason for physician consultations, accounting for approximately 40% of primary care visits. A systematic review by (Gregory and McGowan, 2016)found that hospital-wide pain prevalence among hospitalized adults ranged from 37.7% to 84%, highlighting the significant burden of pain in clinical settings. The International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) defines pain as "an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage". Pain is classified into acute and chronic types based on duration and cause. Acute pain, lasting less than three months, often results from injury, surgery, illness, trauma, or painful medical procedures. In contrast, chronic pain persists or recurs beyond three months and may arise from conditions such as fibromyalgia, arthritis, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), chronic low back pain, chronic headaches or migraines, endometriosis, and chronic fatigue syndrome.

Analgesics, broadly classified into non-opioids, opioids, and adjuvant analgesics, have long been utilized in pain management. Non-opioid analgesics are primarily indicated for mild to moderate pain and include aspirin, acetaminophen, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and naproxen. These drugs exert their analgesic effects by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, and subsequently decreasing inflammation, peripheral nociceptor sensitization, and central pain transmission. In contrast, opioids are predominantly used for moderate to severe pain and include codeine, tramadol, morphine, oxycodone, and fentanyl. They bind to mu (μ), kappa (κ), and delta (δ) opioid receptors in the central and peripheral nervous system, inhibiting neurotransmitter release and pain signal transmission, thereby altering pain perception. Adjuvant analgesics, which enhance the effects of primary analgesics or target specific pain types, include antidepressants, benzodiazepines, anticonvulsants, and corticosteroids, offering additional therapeutic benefits in pain management.

### FDA approves novel non-opioid treatment for moderate to severe… [^eddb1ea9]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

- **For Immediate Release**: Today, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved Journavx 50 milligram oral tablets, a first-in-class non-opioid analgesic, to treat moderate to severe acute pain in adults. Journavx reduces pain by targeting a pain-signaling pathway involving sodium channels in the peripheral nervous system, before pain signals reach the brain. Journavx is the first drug to be approved in this new class of pain management medicines. Pain is a common medical problem and relief of pain is an important therapeutic goal. Acute pain is short-term pain that is typically in response to some form of tissue injury, such as trauma or surgery. Acute pain is often treated with analgesics that may or may not contain opioids. The FDA has long supported development of non-opioid pain treatment.

As part of the FDA Overdose Prevention Framework, the agency has issued draft guidance aimed at encouraging development of non-opioid analgesics for acute pain and awarded cooperative grants to support the development and dissemination of clinical practice guidelines for the management of acute pain conditions. "Today's approval is an important public health milestone in acute pain management, " said Jacqueline Corrigan-Curay, J. D. M. D., acting director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. "A new non-opioid analgesic therapeutic class for acute pain offers an opportunity to mitigate certain risks associated with using an opioid for pain and provides patients with another treatment option. This action and the agency's designations to expedite the drug's development and review underscore FDA's commitment to approving safe and effective alternatives to opioids for pain management".

The efficacy of Journavx was evaluated in two randomized, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled trials of acute surgical pain, one following abdominoplasty and the other following bunionectomy. In addition to receiving the randomized treatment, all participants in the trials with inadequate pain control were permitted to use ibuprofen as needed for "rescue" pain medication. Both trials demonstrated a statistically significant superior reduction in pain with Journavx compared to placebo. The safety profile of Journavx is primarily based on data from the pooled, double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled trials in 874 participants with moderate to severe acute pain following abdominoplasty and bunionectomy, with supportive safety data from one single-arm, open-label study in 256 participants with moderate to severe acute pain in a range of acute pain conditions.

### Non-opioid analgesics role in pain management… [^e5f5e837]. pain-management-cme.nejm.org (2024). Medium credibility.

Non-Opioid Analgesics Role in Pain Management As opioid prescriptions decline, non-opioid analgesics are increasingly emphasized in a variety of clinical settings as a preferred, safe, and effective first-line therapy for mild to moderate acute and chronic pain. Examples of Non-Opioid Analgesics.
- Acetaminophen
- Anticonvulsants
- Antidepressants
- Aspirin
- Other NSAIDs.
- Topical agents List of Non-Opioid Analgesics Differences Among Non-Opioid Analgesics Acetaminophen. The analgesic and fever-reducing effects of acetaminophen are well-known, but its mechanism of action is not. Nevertheless, it is widely considered to be the safest analgesic available, although liver injury is a concern with overdose. Topical treatments.

Topical non-opioid medications such as lidocaine and capsaicin are applied to the skin and thus act locally. Lidocaine works by blocking nerve signals that send the feeling of pain from the site of injury to the brain. It causes a temporary loss of feeling in the area to which it is applied. Capsaicin appears to deplete local neurons of substance P, which is required in the transmission of nociceptive input. Are Non-Opioid Analgesics Appropriate for Severe Pain. Non-Opioid Analgesics in Clinical Settings Non-opioid analgesics can play an important role in the emergency department and intensive care unit. For example, a double-blind clinical trial found that for emergency department patients with acute extremity pain, combinations of non-opioid analgesics may be as effective in reducing pain as opioids.

And a meta-analysis of 12 randomized clinical trials demonstrated that non-opioid analgesics, used as adjuvants to opioids, reduced the consumption and the side effects of opioids in ICU patients with Guillain-Barré syndrome while decreasing patient pain scores.

### Pharmacologic therapy for acute pain [^c7d0e20e]. American Family Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Pharmacologic management of acute pain should be tailored for each patient, including a review of treatment expectations and a plan for the time course of prescriptions. Acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are first-line treatment options for most patients with acute mild to moderate pain. Topical NSAIDs are recommended for non-low back, musculoskeletal injuries. Acetaminophen is well tolerated; however, lower doses should be used in patients with advanced hepatic disease, malnutrition, or severe alcohol use disorder. Nonselective NSAIDs are effective but should be used with caution in patients with a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, cardiovascular disease, or chronic renal disease. Selective cyclooxygenase-2 NSAIDs are a more expensive treatment alternative and are used to avoid the gastrointestinal adverse effects of nonselective NSAIDs. Adjunctive medications may be added as appropriate for specific conditions if the recommended dose and schedule of first-line agents are inadequate (e.g., muscle relaxants may be useful for acute low back pain). For severe or refractory acute pain, treatment can be briefly escalated with the use of medications that work on opioid and monoamine receptors (e.g., tramadol, tapentadol) or with the use of acetaminophen/opioid or NSAID/opioid combinations. The opioid epidemic has increased physician and community awareness of the harms of opioid medications; however, severe acute pain may necessitate short-term use of opioids with attention to minimizing risk, including in patients on medication-assisted therapy for opioid use disorder.

### Safe opioid prescribing for acute noncancer pain in hospitalized adults: a systematic review of existing guidelines [^0e970236]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Pain is common among hospitalized patients. Inpatient prescribing of opioids is not without risk. Acute pain management guidelines could inform safe prescribing of opioids in the hospital and limit associated unintended consequences.

Purpose

To evaluate the quality and content of existing guidelines for acute, noncancer pain management.

Data Sources

The National Guideline Clearinghouse, MEDLINE via PubMed, websites of relevant specialty societies and other organizations, and selected international search engines.

Study Selection

Guidelines published between January 2010 and August 2017 addressing acute, noncancer pain management among adults were considered. Guidelines that focused on chronic pain, specific diseases, and the nonhospital setting were excluded.

Data Extraction

Quality was assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument.

Data Synthesis

Four guidelines met the selection criteria. Most recommendations were based on expert consensus. The guidelines recommended restricting opioids to severe pain or pain that has not responded to nonopioid therapy, using the lowest effective dose of short-acting opioids for the shortest duration possible, and co-prescribing opioids with nonopioid analgesics. The guidelines generally recommended checking the prescription drug monitoring program when prescribing opioids, developing goals for patient recovery, and educating patients regarding the risks and side effects of opioid therapy. Additional recommendations included using an opioid dose conversion guide, avoidance of co-administration of parenteral and oral opioids, and using caution when co-prescribing opioids with other central nervous system depressants.

Conclusions

Guidelines, based largely on expert opinion, recommend judicious prescribing of opioids for severe, acute pain. Future work should assess the implications of these recommendations on hospital-based pain management.

### Moving toward a multimodal analgesic regimen for acute sickle cell pain with non-opioid analgesic adjuncts: a narrative review [^9c580a40]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Multimodal Analgesic Therapy: An Untested Strategy in SCD Management

Pain experts are now advocating for a shift away from a "one size fits all" pain management approach to a targeted approach, based on the underlying pain mechanism(s) of a disease process. The moderate evidence for the clinical efficacy of opioids for relief of acute SCD pain, as well as the concern for ORAEs, raise an urgent need for clinical trials of multimodal approaches to the management of acute SCD pain. Such trials should determine whether these approaches are efficacious in SCD, as is being done for other acute-on-chronic painful diseases such as rheumatic diseases (eg. rheumatoid arthritis, and ankylosing spondylarthritis) and inflammatory bowel disease.

Meanwhile, as we wait for future trials on the efficacy of multimodal analgesia for SCD pain, we advocate that the balance of benefits and harms demands empiric use of multimodal therapies now for acute SCD pain. Based on evidence in other disease states, we advocate for a multimodal or multi-mechanistic-based therapeutic approach with empiric use but also careful monitoring for effective analgesia despite decreased treatment with opioids. The potential benefits include decreased ORAEs and harm reduction from potential opioid misuse and diversion.

In this review, we support this advocacy by providing a summary of the evidence of the benefits of non-opioid pharmacological analgesics for management of acute SCD pain. Like the pool of opioid studies, the pool of studies of non-opioid pharmacological interventions for acute SCD pain is small, and the evidence is primarily found in retrospective studies and small prospective trials (Table 1). Therefore, the review will draw attention to analgesics that although may require further clinical exploration to demonstrate their efficacy for acute SCD pain, can currently be used as adjuncts to opioids. The review will also draw attention to non-opioid analgesics with evidence of efficacy in other painful conditions. Lastly, our review will propose a novel explanatory model for SCD pain, adapted from the work of pain pioneer Richard Melzack, to support multimodal analgesia as well as multidisciplinary treatment of all types of SCD pain. A comprehensive understanding of SCD pain is not only critical to development of new interventions but also important in the assessment of the clinical efficacy of existing interventions, such as the ones highlighted in this review.

### Moving toward a multimodal analgesic regimen for acute sickle cell pain with non-opioid analgesic adjuncts: a narrative review [^30bdcaf4]. Journal of Pain Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusions and Future Directions

An adaptation of Richard Melzack's multidimensional pain model –the neuromatrix theory– as a framework for conceptualizing sickle cell pain indicates that management of acute sickle cell pain should be multimodal and individualized. However, significant gaps remain in analgesic management of acute SCD pain. Standard analgesic management for VOCs has been based on little evidence, and expert consensus has evolved mostly from expert-panel-guided opinions and reviews of the scant literature evidence. This is especially true for opioids, long considered the mainstay of treatment for acute SCD pain. Many analgesic drugs, such as intravenous lidocaine, ketamine, pregabalin and gabapentin, are relatively untested in SCD. They rely on non-opioid mechanisms. However, at the moment, they are used inconsistently. Given the complex pathophysiology of SCD pain, it is imperative to test whether their widespread use is warranted, by conducting well-designed multi-center RCTs. It is encouraging that, since the completion of our literature search, several studies assessing the efficacy of these adjuncts for sickle cell pain have been published. These analgesics have the potential to expand treatment for VOCs to a true multimodal approach, and as a result, attenuate some of the possible adverse effects of the opioid analgesics. Our explanatory pain model for SCD captures the multidimensional nature of the pain experience and suggests new SCD pain targets as well as new measures of efficacy.

### Nonopioid therapies for pain management… [^a48288aa]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute pain Nonopioid therapies are at least as effective as opioids for many common types of acute pain. Clinicians should maximize use of nonpharmacologic and nonopioid therapies as appropriate for the specific condition and patient and only consider opioid therapy for acute pain if benefits are anticipated to outweigh risks to the patient. Many acute pain conditions can often be managed most effectively with nonopioid medications. Noninvasive and nonpharmacologic approaches to acute pain also have the potential to improve pain and function without risk for serious harms. Clinicians can consider using nonopioid therapies to treat common types of acute pain including:

- Low back or neck pain
- Dental pain
- Kidney stone pain
- Pain related to musculoskeletal injuries
- Pain related to minor surgeries typically associated with minimal tissue injury and mild postoperative pain
- Headaches, including episodic migraine. Nonopioid treatment options for acute pain Nonpharmacologic pain therapies
- Ice
- Heat
- Elevation
- Rest
- Immobilization
- Exercise Nonopioid medications
- Topical or oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
- Acetaminophen
- Triptans, antiemetics, and dihydroergotamine for migraine Refer to Recommendation 1 in the 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline for additional information and examples of nonopioid therapies to treat acute pain.
- Low-level laser therapy
- Acupuncture
- Massage
- Spinal manipulation Exercise, mind-body interventions, and behavioral treatments can encourage active patient participation in the care plan and help address the effects of pain in the patient's life. Nonopioid medications Several nonopioid pharmacologic therapies can be used for subacute and chronic pain conditions. Some examples include:

- Topical and oral NSAIDs
- Acetaminophen
- Tricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants
- Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor antidepressants
- Anticonvulsants
- Capsaicin and lidocaine patches.

### Clinical policy: critical issues related to opioids in adult patients presenting to the emergency department [^9411b282]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Emergency department discharge opioids for acute pain — patient management recommendations specify Level A recommendations: none specified; Level B recommendations: none specified; and Level C recommendations: "Preferentially prescribe nonopioid analgesic therapies (nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic) rather than opioids as the initial treatment of acute pain in patients discharged from the ED". For cases in which opioid medications are deemed necessary, the guidance is to "prescribe the lowest effective dose of a short-acting opioid for the shortest time indicated", with potential benefits including reducing dependence and misuse including death from overdose, preventing unnecessary adverse effects when alternatives with less severe adverse effects are available, and avoiding opioid-induced hyperalgesia, while a potential harm is that excessive limitations may lead to inadequate pain management.

### Harms and benefits of opioids for management of non-surgical acute and chronic low back pain: a systematic review [^265e0221]. British Journal of Sports Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Consequences of prescription opioid use involve harms, addiction, tolerance and death. Despite routine prescription, opioids are not recommended for initial intervention by any major multidisciplinary low back pain (LBP) guideline.

Objective

Our primary purpose was to improve overall understanding of the harms and benefits associated with oral opioid interventions prescribed for treatment of acute or chronic back pain. Our second goal was to evaluate pain intensity and to compare and contrast these data with the harms. Our last objective was to evaluate conflicts of interest among the study authors and the findings.

Design/Data/Eligibility Criteria

Studies incorporating oral prescription opioid management of non-surgical LBP were evaluated. After systematic assessment, no studies that met inclusion included participants with specifically acute LBP. Therefore, extracted data reflects only populations with subacute and chronic LBP. Data on reported harms, severe harms, pain outcomes and withdrawal rates were extracted and meta-analyses were completed for opioid versus placebo trials and opioids versus non-opioid trials.

Results

Fourteen studies met inclusion/exclusion requirements. All trials involved short-term management with limited follow-up. A high percentage of harms were identified across most studies. Opioids were not shown to be superior to other medications, and only showed superiority to placebo comparators (at cost of additional harms).

Conclusion

This review identified trends of higher harms rates and higher percentages of severe harms in opioid arms for the management of subacute and chronic LBP. The majority of trials that demonstrated benefits with opioids also had potential conflicts of interest. Lastly, non-opioid medications demonstrated statistically significant pain improvement compared with opioids. We feel that the results of the trial are supportive of current LBP guidelines and do not condone the initial use of opioids in management of subacute or chronic LBP.

### Opioid prescribing for acute pain management in children and adolescents in outpatient settings: clinical practice guideline [^b80136a5]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Acute pain management in children and adolescents — nonopioid first-line and role of opioids: Acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) "should be the primary pharmacologic strategy" for the expected duration of healing and "can be used around the clock, if needed, when treating acute pain". Opioids "should be reserved for patients who are experiencing moderate-to-severe pain despite the use of the strategies described above", and, to minimize risk, "opioids should not be used alone for analgesia". The text notes "evidence for equal analgesia with NSAIDs alone for some injuries and procedures" and "equal or superior analgesia — with fewer opioid side effects — with combination therapies of acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and opioids after more painful procedures".

### Acute pain management after trauma: what you need to know [^89b3ede5]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Effective acute pain control is mandatory after injury. Opioids continue to be a pillar acute pain management of strategies despite not being as effective as some nonnarcotic alternatives. An acute pain management strategy after trauma should be thoughtful, effective, and responsible. A thoughtful approach includes managing a patient's expectations for acute pain control and ensuring that interventions purposefully and rationally affect the domain of pain that is uncontrolled. An effective pain management strategy includes a multimodal approach using acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and regional anesthesia. A responsible acute pain management approach includes knowing the relative strengths of the opioids prescribed and standardized approach to opioid prescribing at discharge to minimize diversion. Acute pain management is quite understudied, and future considerations include a reliable objective measurement of pain and the evaluation of nonmedication acute pain interventions.

### Attempts to limit opioid prescribing in critically ill patients: not so easy, not so fast [^539c6ea8]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

To discuss why opioids have been considered the long-standing first-line therapy for treating acute, severe nociceptive pain in critically ill patients and discuss considerations for limiting opioid overuse in the intensive care unit setting.

Data Sources

Articles were identified through searches of PubMed and EMBASE from database inception until December 2018. Additional references were located through a review of the bibliographies of articles and clinical practice guidelines.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Original research articles excluding case reports were included if they concerned nonopioid agents for pain management in critically ill patients. The focus was on studies not included in the most recent pain management guidelines.

Data Synthesis

Ten studies were retrieved. Nonopioid therapies or opioid-sparing therapies have been touted as possible alternatives for critically ill patients, but they have particular adverse effects concerns in critically ill patients, often lack parenteral dosage forms, and frequently require dose adjustment or avoidance in patients with renal or hepatic dysfunction. Relevance to Patient Care and Clinical Practice: There is a well-recognized opioid epidemic that has been the subject of much discussion. Attempts to control the epidemic have focused on limiting opioid prescribing and using nonopioid alternatives, but there are special considerations when treating severe pain in critically ill patients that often preclude nonopioid analgesics.

Conclusions

There continues to be an unmet need for medications that are as effective as opioids for severe nociceptive pain in critically ill patients but without the adverse effect and abuse concerns. Until such medications are available, clinicians need to optimize prescribing of opioid and nonopioid analgesics.

### Efficacy of non-opioid analgesics to control postoperative pain: a network meta-analysis [^799ccce4]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Management of postoperative pain remains a significant issue, including providing adequate pain control beyond immediate postsurgical recovery. Poorly managed acute postoperative pain may have a significant impact on clinical and economic outcomes and is a consistent risk factor for persistent or chronic postoperative pain. Opioid analgesics are the foundation of treatment for moderate-to-severe postsurgical pain and are among the most effective agents for the management of pain in many settings. However, opioids are associated with the potential risks of opioid-related adverse drug events (ORADEs), (such as respiratory and gastrointestinal related events) and abuse or dependence, which can significantly increase the cost of medical care.

Multimodal pain management guidelines have been developed that provide guidance on reducing opioid monotherapy and the doses of opioids used to treat acute pain, while still providing effective pain management This approach involves the administration of various opioid and non-opioid agents that act on different sites, resulting in a synergistic and additive effect. The goal of multimodal pain management is to reduce ORADEs and their costs, as well as the risks of opioid abuse or dependence.

Non-opioid pharmacologic therapies for potential use in the multimodal regimen include acetaminophen and/or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Recent practice guidelines have recommended that unless contraindicated, all patients should receive around-the-clock treatment with acetaminophen or NSAIDs as part of multimodal analgesia for post-operative pain management. When NSAIDs and/or acetaminophen are included in treatment regimens with opioids for pain relief, an opioid-sparing effect has been demonstrated. Intravenous use of NSAIDs can achieve a faster onset of action and peak plasma concentrations compared to oral treatment regimens. Parenteral formulations of ketorolac and ibuprofen were the only IV NSAIDs currently approved for postoperative pain management in the United States (US) at the time this study was conducted. Studies have found that ketorolac reduces opioid consumption by 25–45% and provides additional benefits such as improving bowel function after colorectal surgery and epidural pain after cesarean delivery. Intravenous ibuprofen is approved for the management of mild to moderate pain and for the management of moderate to severe pain as an adjunct to opioid analgesics. Another non-opioid analgesic, acetaminophen, has an onset of action of 15 min when given as IV which is faster than the oral formulation and is associated with opioid-sparing effects.

### Suzetrigine approval breaks a 25-year silence: a new era in non-opioid acute pain management [^29230181]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Pain management remains a critical priority in clinical practice. Meanwhile, traditional analgesics, including non-opioid and opioid medications, often pose substantial risks, including adverse effects and potential for addiction. The recent approval of Suzetrigine by the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) represents a pivotal advancement in non-opioid analgesia for the treatment of moderate-to-severe acute pain. Suzetrigine, a selective NaV1.8 sodium channel inhibitor, provides effective pain relief by targeting peripheral pain pathways, minimizing the risk of addiction commonly associated with opioids, and has good safety profile according to clinical trials. Given the growing concerns surrounding opioid use, Suzetrigine offers a promising therapeutic alternative in acute pain management, with future research needed to assess its long-term effectiveness in diverse populations.

### Implementation interventions to promote healthcare professional uptake of evidence-based opioid prescribing for adults with acute non-cancer pain [^2f41ec99]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute non‐cancer pain may be managed using non‐pharmacological (e.g. ice) and pharmacological (e.g. analgesia) treatments. Not all acute non‐cancer pain conditions are managed the same way. For example, paracetamol is effective for pain relief in people with episodic tension‐type headache, but may provide minimal benefit for people with acute low back pain.

Opioid analgesics are frequently prescribed for people with acute non‐cancer pain. In Australian general practice settings between 2014 and 2018, general practitioners prescribed opioid analgesics within one year of diagnosis for one in three people with low back pain, and one in four people with neck, shoulder and knee pain. In another Australian study, 99% of people undergoing joint replacement were prescribed opioids in the acute postoperative period following surgery.

The use of opioids to treat some acutely painful non‐cancer conditions, such as acute low back pain, is now being questioned. This is due to new evidence suggesting that they have little or no benefit, which may not outweigh the risk of short‐ and longer‐term harms. Adverse effects associated with short‐term use may include nausea, vomiting, constipation, dizziness and drowsiness. Prolonged opioid use can lead to dependence, overdose and death. There may also be interactions with other drugs, particularly in older people with multi‐morbidity and polypharmacy.

Guidelines including clinical care standards and opioid stewardship provide guidance to healthcare professionals on appropriate opioid prescribing practices to optimise patient outcomes and reduce the potential for opioid‐related harm. Clinical care standards for people with acute non‐cancer pain include guidance to cease opioid analgesic use as patients' acute pain and function improve.

Inappropriate use of opioids includes inappropriate prescription (i.e. when safer options would have been appropriate), prescription at too high a dose, prescription of the wrong formulation (e.g. modified release instead of immediate release), prescription of excessive quantities or durations, and prescription without a plan for reducing or ceasing opioids to prevent inadvertent conversion to long‐term use. In a Canadian study, patients discharged from an emergency department with acute pain and prescribed opioids consumed one‐third of their prescribed dose with the majority of their opioid prescription potentially misused.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^5567fd5b]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Acute pain in trauma — burden, goals, and evolving practice — is common and affects function, with the majority of trauma victims experiencing pain and acute pain impacting respiratory function, metabolic demand, wound healing, immunity, and mobility. Long-term sequelae are frequent, as Nearly two-thirds of patients report at least moderate pain 12 months after injury and three in four report pain interference with activities of daily living. The treatment goal is a tolerable pain level that allows the patient to function, not 'zero pain'. Practice has shifted over the last decade due to the opioid crisis in the United States, prompting calls from the American Medical Association (AMA), the Orthopaedic Trauma Association (OTA), and the American College of Surgeons (ACS) to minimize opioid use, alongside new research supporting the safety and efficacy of nonopioid analgesia. Management must be individualized because unique environments and patient populations present challenges that prevent a one-size-fits-all approach.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^e235245a]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Implementation Considerations

Nontraumatic, nonsurgical acute pain can often be managed without opioids (see Recommendation 1).
Opioids are sometimes needed for treatment of acute pain (see Recommendation 1). When the diagnosis and severity of acute pain warrant use of opioids, clinicians should prescribe no greater quantity than needed for the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids. For many common causes of nontraumatic, nonsurgical pain, when opioids are needed, a few days or less are often sufficient, and shorter courses can minimize the need to taper opioids to prevent withdrawal symptoms at the end of a course of opioids. However, durations should be individualized to the patient's clinical circumstances.
Clinicians should generally avoid prescribing additional opioids to patients just in case pain continues longer than expected.
For postoperative pain related to major surgery, procedure-specific opioid prescribing recommendations are available with ranges for amounts of opioids needed (on the basis of actual use and refills and on consensus).
To minimize unintended effects on patients, clinicians, practices, and health systems should have mechanisms in place for the subset of patients who experience severe acute pain that continues longer than the expected duration. These mechanisms should allow for timely reevaluation to confirm or revise the initial diagnosis and adjust pain management accordingly. Clinicians, practices, and health systems can help minimize disparities in access to and affordability of care and refills by ensuring all patients can obtain and afford additional evaluation and treatment, as needed.
Longer durations of opioid therapy are more likely to be needed when the mechanism of injury is expected to result in prolonged severe pain (e.g. severe traumatic injuries).
Patients should be evaluated at least every 2 weeks if they continue to receive opioids for acute pain.
If opioids are continued for ≥ 1 month, clinicians should ensure that potentially reversible causes of chronic pain are addressed and that opioid prescribing for acute pain does not unintentionally become long-term opioid therapy simply because medications are continued without reassessment. Continuation of opioid therapy at this point might represent initiation of long-term opioid therapy, which should occur only as an intentional decision that benefits are likely to outweigh risks after discussion between the clinician and patient and as part of a comprehensive pain management approach. Clinicians should refer to recommendations on subacute and chronic pain for initiation (Recommendation 2), follow-up (Recommendation 7), and tapering (Recommendation 5) of ongoing opioid therapy.
If patients already receiving long-term opioid therapy require additional opioids for superimposed severe acute pain (e.g. major surgery), opioids should be continued only for the duration of pain severe enough to require additional opioids, returning to the patient's baseline opioid dosage as soon as possible, including a taper to baseline dosage if additional opioids were used around the clock for more than a few days.
If opioids are used continuously (around the clock) for more than a few days for acute pain, clinicians should prescribe a brief taper to minimize withdrawal symptoms on discontinuation of opioids.
If a taper is needed, taper durations might need to be adjusted depending on the duration of the initial opioid prescription (see Supporting Rationale for this recommendation for additional details).
Tapering plans should be discussed with the patient before hospital discharge and with clinicians coordinating the patient's care as an outpatient. (See Recommendation 5 for tapering considerations when patients have taken opioids continuously for > 1 month.)

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^285f1ff2]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Implementation Considerations

Nonopioid therapies are at least as effective as opioids for many common acute pain conditions, including low back pain, neck pain, pain related to other musculoskeletal injuries (e.g. sprains, strains, tendonitis, and bursitis), pain related to minor surgeries typically associated with minimal tissue injury and mild postoperative pain (e.g. simple dental extraction), dental pain, kidney stone pain, and headaches including episodic migraine.
Clinicians should maximize use of nonopioid pharmacologic (e.g. topical or oral NSAIDs, acetaminophen) and nonpharmacologic (e.g. ice, heat, elevation, rest, immobilization, or exercise) therapies as appropriate for the specific condition.
Opioid therapy has an important role for acute pain related to severe traumatic injuries (including crush injuries and burns), invasive surgeries typically associated with moderate to severe postoperative pain, and other severe acute pain when NSAIDs and other therapies are contraindicated or likely to be ineffective.
When diagnosis and severity of acute pain warrant the use of opioids, clinicians should prescribe immediate-release opioids (see Recommendation 3) at the lowest effective dose (see Recommendation 4) and for no longer than the expected duration of pain severe enough to require opioids (see Recommendation 6).
Clinicians should prescribe and advise opioid use only as needed (e.g. hydrocodone 5 mg/acetaminophen 325 mg, one tablet not more frequently than every 4 hours as needed for moderate to severe pain) rather than on a scheduled basis (e.g. one tablet every 4 hours) and encourage and recommend an opioid taper if opioids are taken around the clock for more than a few days (see Recommendation 6).
If patients already receiving opioids long term require additional medication for acute pain, nonopioid medications should be used when possible and, if additional opioids are required (e.g. for superimposed severe acute pain), they should be continued only for the duration of pain severe enough to require additional opioids, returning to the patient's baseline opioid dosage as soon as possible, including a taper to baseline dosage if additional opioids were used around the clock for more than a few days (see Recommendation 6).
Clinicians should ensure that patients are aware of expected benefits of, common risks of, serious risks of, and alternatives to opioids before starting or continuing opioid therapy and should involve patients meaningfully in decisions about whether to start opioid therapy.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^98ff9474]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Category A recommendations indicate that most patients should receive the recommended course of action; category B recommendations indicate that different choices will be appropriate for different patients, requiring clinicians to help patients arrive at a decision consistent with patient values and preferences and specific clinical situations. Consistent with the ACIP and GRADE method, category A recommendations were made, even with type 3 and 4 evidence, when there was broad agreement that the advantages of a clinical action greatly outweighed the disadvantages. Category B recommendations were made when there was broad agreement that the advantages and disadvantages of a clinical action were more balanced, but advantages were significant enough to warrant a recommendation. Recommendations were associated with a range of evidence types, from type 1 to type 4.

In summary, the categorization of recommendations was based on the following assessment:

A number of nonpharmacologic treatments and nonopioid medications are associated with improvements in pain, function, or both that are reportedly comparable to improvements associated with opioid use.
Evidence exists that multiple noninvasive nonpharmacologic interventions improve chronic pain and function, with small to moderate effects in specific pain conditions, and are not associated with serious harms. Compared with medication treatment, for which benefits are anticipated while patients are taking the medication but are not usually expected to persist after patients stop taking the medication, multiple noninvasive nonpharmacologic interventions are associated with improvements in pain, function, or both that are sustained after completion of treatment.
Nonopioid drugs, including serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) antidepressants, pregabalin or gabapentin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), are associated with small to moderate improvements in chronic pain and function. Drug class–specific adverse events include serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, or renal effects with NSAIDs and sedation with anticonvulsants.
Opioid therapy is associated with similar or decreased effectiveness for pain and function versus NSAIDs across multiple common acute pain conditions. Opioid therapy is associated with small improvements in short-term (duration of 1 to < 6 months) pain and function compared with placebo, with increased short-term harms compared with placebo, and with evidence of attenuated pain reduction over time (between 3 and 6 months versus between 1 and 3 months). Evidence exists from observational studies of an association between opioid use for acute pain and long-term opioid use. Evidence on long-term effectiveness of opioids remains very limited; a long-term (12 months) randomized trial of stepped therapy for chronic musculoskeletal pain found no difference in function and higher pain intensity after starting with opioid therapy compared with starting with nonopioid therapy. Evidence exists of increased risk for serious harms (including opioid use disorder and overdose) with long-term opioid therapy that appears to rise with increase in opioid dosage, without a clear threshold below which there is no risk.
No validated, reliable way exists to predict which patients will experience serious harm from opioid therapy and which patients will benefit from opioid therapy.
Discontinuing opioids after extended periods of continuous opioid use can be challenging for clinicians and patients. Tapering or discontinuing opioids in patients who have taken them long term can be associated with clinically significant risks, particularly if opioids are tapered rapidly or patients do not receive effective support.
Patients, caregivers, and clinicians responded to CDC with invited input about their experiences and perspectives related to pain and pain management options. Themes included strained patient-clinician relationships and the need for patients and clinicians to make shared decisions, the effects of misapplication of the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline, inconsistent access to effective pain management solutions, and achieving reduced prescription opioid use through diverse approaches.
Members of the public responded to CDC with invited comments. Themes included experiences with pain or experiences in the aftermath of the overdose of a friend, family member, or significant other; barriers and access to pain care and to evidence-based treatment; concerns about the level of specificity of recommendations; and overall communication and implementation of the clinical practice guideline.

### Dexmedetomidine in perioperative acute pain management: a non-opioid adjuvant analgesic [^ec6b7cb7]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Many nociceptive, inflammatory, and neuropathic pathways contribute to perioperative pain. Although opioids have long been a mainstay for perioperative analgesia, other non-opioid therapies, and dexmedetomidine, in particular, have been increasingly used as part of a multimodal analgesic regimen to provide improved pain control while minimizing opioid-related side effects. This article reviews the evidence supporting the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative efficacy of dexmedetomidine as an adjuvant, and the efficacy of intravenous, spinal canal, and nerve block analgesia with dexmedetomidine for perioperative acute pain treatment. While there have not been any large-scale clinical trials conducted, the current body of evidence suggests that dexmedetomidine is suitable for use as an adjuvant analgesic at all perioperative stages. However, there are potential adverse effects, such as hypotension and bradycardia, which must be taken into consideration by clinicians.

### New insights into the use of currently available non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [^1bcb7d4a]. Journal of Pain Research (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pain represents a major public health problem worldwide,–with chronic pain affecting approximately 27% of the adult population in Europeand more than 100 million adults in the United States. Undertreated acute pain can be associated with an increased risk of deleterious health consequences (eg, delayed wound healing, immune dysfunction, cardiovascular problems related to the stress response, and respiratory problems, such as pneumonia) and the development of chronic pain. In addition, unrelieved chronic severe pain can negatively impact an individual's quality of life, day-to-day functioning, sleep quality, interpersonal relationships, and work productivity, and is associated with a substantial economic burden.

There are two major options for the pharmacological management of pain: non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which act via inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) isozymes, and opiate/opioid analgesics.NSAIDs, which are among the most widely used medications worldwide, are often preferred because of their low abuse potential, robust efficacy, and long history of clinical use. Guidelines for pain management tend to be specific to medical conditions or settings. Current guidelines for chronic low back pain and osteoarthritis generally recommend the use of oral acetaminophen (or topical NSAIDs for osteoarthritis) for first-line pain management, with other oral NSAIDs recommended in the first-line or second-line setting depending on the specific guideline; some guidelines also recommend opioids, although typically not as first-line therapy.–It has, however, recently been shown that acetaminophen is not measurably effective in acute low back pain (ie, not more effective than placebo). Other work in patients with osteoarthritis demonstrated that ibuprofen was associated with greater improvements compared with acetaminophen in measures of osteoarthritis pain, function, and quality of life. Acetaminophen and other oral NSAIDs are also recommended for acute pain, such as postoperative pain management.

### Evidence-based guidelines for prehospital pain management: recommendations [^8081822d]. Prehospital Emergency Care (2023). High credibility.

Prehospital pain management — conclusions: Non-opioid analgesics, including NSAIDs, APAP, and ketamine offer options for pain management with comparable efficacy to opioids and with more favorable adverse effect profiles, and increased analgesic options and routes of administration may help to increase the proportion of patients treated appropriately for their pain and also help to address disparities. The panel viewed the recommendations as an opportunity to increase the awareness of the number and variety of medications available for the management of pain in the prehospital setting, and increased options also present opportunities for "shared decision-making" in which prehospital clinicians can present options for pain management and select an analgesic based on the patient's desires, including avoiding opioid medications or potential adverse effects such as nausea, dizziness, or dysphoria. Increased availability of IN fentanyl for pediatric patients may help to increase the number of children treated for acute pain by overcoming clinician barriers to providing analgesia, such as challenges in obtaining IV access to children, and acceptance by pediatric patients and their caregivers.

### The treatment of acute pain in the emergency department: a white paper position statement prepared for the American academy of emergency medicine [^2c5aee4c]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Medium credibility.

Chronic pain exacerbations in the emergency department — nonopioid prioritization and limited opioid discharge are emphasized: When patients present to the ED with an exacerbation of chronic pain, the clinician should utilize nonpharmacological and nonopioid analgesic modalities, as opioids are more likely to cause harm than benefit in these cases. For patients with chronic pain, opioids should be prescribed by a physician who will provide ongoing care and who can use opioids as part of an analgesic care plan that includes specific functional goals as well as an opioid contract, and emergency clinicians should attempt to contact a patient's principle opioid prescriber prior to prescribing an opioid analgesic for an exacerbation of chronic pain. However, should a patient require an opioid analgesic, a very short course of 2–3 days of an immediate-release opioid may be prescribed at discharge.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute low back pain [^1f124db6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute low back pain (LBP) is a common health problem. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used in the treatment of LBP, particularly in people with acute LBP. In 2008, a Cochrane Review was published about the efficacy of NSAIDs for LBP (acute, chronic, and sciatica), identifying a small but significant effect in favour of NSAIDs compared to placebo for short-term pain reduction and global improvement in participants with acute LBP. This is an update of the previous review, focusing on acute LBP.

Objectives

To assess the effects of NSAIDs compared to placebo and other comparison treatments for acute LBP.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, and two trials registers for randomised controlled trials (RCT) to 7 January 2020. We also screened the reference lists from relevant reviews and included studies.

Selection Criteria

We included RCTs that assessed the use of one or more types of NSAIDs compared to placebo (the main comparison) or alternative treatments for acute LBP in adults (≥ 18 years); conducted in both primary and secondary care settings. We assessed the effects of treatment on pain reduction, disability, global improvement, adverse events, and return to work.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected trials to be included in this review, evaluated the risk of bias, and extracted the data. If appropriate, we performed a meta-analysis, using a random-effects model throughout, due to expected variability between studies. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included 32 trials, with a total of 5356 participants (age range 16 to 78 years). Follow-up ranged from one day to six months. Studies were conducted across the globe, the majority taking place in Europe and North-America. Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean region were not represented. We considered seven studies at low risk of bias. Performance and attrition were the most common biases. There was often a lack of information on randomisation procedures and allocation concealment (selection bias); studies were prone to selective reporting bias, since most studies did not register their trials. Almost half of the studies were industry-funded. There is moderate quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective in short-term (≤ 3 weeks) reduction of pain intensity (visual analogue scale (VAS), 0 to 100) than placebo (mean difference (MD) -7.29 (95% confidence interval (CI) -10.98 to -3.61; 4 RCTs, N = 815). There is high quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective for short-term improvement in disability (Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ), 0 to 24) than placebo (MD -2.02, 95% CI -2.89 to -1.15; 2 RCTs, N = 471). The magnitude of these effects is small and probably not clinically relevant. There is low quality evidence that NSAIDs are slightly more effective for short-term global improvement than placebo (risk ratio (RR) 1.40, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.75; 5 RCTs, N = 1201), but there was substantial heterogeneity (I² 52%) between studies. There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events when using NSAIDs compared to placebo (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.18; 6 RCTs, N = 1394). There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference between the proportion of participants who could return to work after seven days between those who used NSAIDs and those who used placebo (RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.98 to 2.23; 1 RCT, N = 266). There is low quality evidence of no clear difference in short-term reduction of pain intensity between those who took selective COX-2 inhibitor NSAIDs compared to non-selective NSAIDs (mean change from baseline -2.60, 95% CI -9.23 to 4.03; 2 RCTs, N = 437). There is moderate quality evidence of conflicting results for short-term disability improvement between groups (2 RCTs, N = 437). Low quality evidence from one trial (N = 333) reported no clear difference between groups in the proportion of participants experiencing global improvement. There is very low quality evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events between those who took COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.50; 2 RCTs, N = 444). No data were reported for return to work.

Authors' Conclusions

This updated Cochrane Review included 32 trials to evaluate the efficacy of NSAIDs in people with acute LBP. The quality of the evidence ranged from high to very low, thus further research is (very) likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimates of effect, and may change the estimates. NSAIDs seemed slightly more effective than placebo for short-term pain reduction (moderate certainty), disability (high certainty), and global improvement (low certainty), but the magnitude of the effects is small and probably not clinically relevant. There was no clear difference in short-term pain reduction (low certainty) when comparing selective COX-2 inhibitors to non-selective NSAIDs. We found very low evidence of no clear difference in the proportion of participants experiencing adverse events in both the comparison of NSAIDs versus placebo and selective COX-2 inhibitors versus non-selective NSAIDs. We were unable to draw conclusions about adverse events and the safety of NSAIDs for longer-term use, since we only included RCTs with a primary focus on short-term use of NSAIDs and a short follow-up. These are not optimal for answering questions about longer-term or rare adverse events.

Introduction

Background

Pain is one of the most common reasons adults seek medical care in the United States. Acute pain, a nearly universal experience, is a physiologic response to noxious stimuli that can become pathologic. Acute pain is usually sudden in onset and time limited (defined in this clinical practice guideline as having a duration of < 1 month) and often is caused by injury, trauma, or medical treatments such as surgery. Unresolved acute pain or subacute pain (defined in this clinical practice guideline as pain that has been present for 1–3 months) can evolve into chronic pain. Chronic pain typically lasts > 3 months and can be the result of an underlying medical disease or condition, injury, medical treatment, inflammation, or unknown cause. Approximately one in five U.S. adults had chronic pain in 2019 and approximately one in 14 adults experienced "high-impact" chronic pain, defined as having pain on most days or every day during the past 3 months that limited life or work activities. Pain, especially chronic pain, can affect almost every aspect of a person's life, leading to impaired physical functioning, poor mental health, and reduced quality of life, and contributes to substantial morbidity each year. In 2011, the economic costs of chronic pain were estimated to range from $560 to $635 billion in annual direct medical costs, lost productivity, and disability.

### Pharmacologic therapy for acute pain [^bc2f3d4e]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

The approach to patients with acute pain begins by identifying the underlying cause and a disease-specific treatment. The first-line pharmacologic agent for the symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate pain is acetaminophen or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). The choice between these two medications depends on the type of pain and patient risk factors for NSAID-related adverse effects (e.g., gastrointestinal, renovascular, or cardiovascular effects). Different NSAIDs have similar analgesic effects. However, cyclooxygenase-2 selective NSAIDs (e.g., celecoxib) must be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular risk factors and are more expensive than nonselective NSAIDs. If these first-line agents are not sufficient for mild to moderate pain, medications that target separate pathways simultaneously, such as an acetaminophen/opioid combination, are reasonable choices. Severe acute pain is typically treated with potent opioids. At each step, adjuvant medications directed at the underlying condition can be used. Newer medications with dual actions (e.g., tapentadol) are also an option. There is little evidence that one opioid is superior for pain control, but there are some pharmacologic differences among opioids. Because of the growing misuse and diversion of controlled substances, caution should be used when prescribing opioids, even for short-term treatment. Patients should be advised to properly dispose of unused medications.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^cc0303f3]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — pain care for individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) — For all patients with pain, it is important that the correct diagnosis is made and that pain is addressed, and alternative treatments including non-opioid medications with pain modulating properties, behavioral approaches, physical therapy, and procedural approaches should be considered before prescribing opioid medications for pain. If pharmacological treatment is considered, non-opioid analgesics and non-opioid medications with pain modulating properties should be tried first. For patients with pain who have an active OUD but are not in treatment, methadone or buprenorphine should be considered, and the patient's OUD and pain should be stabilized and managed concurrently. For patients taking methadone or buprenorphine for OUD, temporarily increasing the dose or dosing frequency (split dosing) may be effective for managing pain. For patients taking methadone for OUD with acute pain refractory to other treatments who require additional opioid-based analgesia, adding a short acting full agonist opioid to their regular dose of methadone can be considered to manage moderate to severe acute pain, and the dose of additional full agonist opioid analgesic prescribed is anticipated to be higher than the typical doses necessary to achieve adequate analgesia in opioid-naive individuals. Patients receiving buprenorphine for OUD who have moderate to severe acute pain refractory to other treatments and require additional opioid-based analgesia may benefit from the addition of as-needed doses of buprenorphine.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^1d07e320]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale

Since release of the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline, new evidence has emerged on the benefits and risks of prescription opioids for both acute and chronic pain, comparisons with nonopioid pain treatments, dosing strategies, opioid dose-dependent effects, risk mitigation strategies, and opioid tapering and discontinuation. This evidence includes studies on misapplication of the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline, benefits and risks of different tapering strategies and rapid tapering associated with patient harm (,–), challenges in patient access to opioids, patient abandonment and abrupt discontinuation of opioids, a seminal randomized clinical trial comparing prescription opioids to nonopioid medications on long-term pain outcomes, the association of characteristics of initial opioid prescriptions with subsequent likelihood for long-term opioid use, and the small proportion of opioids used by patients compared with the amount prescribed to them for postoperative pain.

Opioid medications remain a common treatment for pain despite declines in the number of opioid prescriptions after 2012. During 2015–2018, approximately 6% of U.S. adults reported use of one or more prescription opioids during the past 30 days, and in 2020, approximately 143 million opioid prescriptions were dispensed from pharmacies in the United States. Rates of opioid prescribing continue to vary across states, medical specialties, patient demographics, and pain conditions in ways that cannot be explained by the underlying health status of the population, and often are discordant with the 2016 CDC Opioid Prescribing Guideline recommendations (,–). The prevalence of prescription opioid misuse and prescription opioid use disorder also has declined in recent years. In 2019, among persons aged ≥ 12 years in the United States, 9.7 million reported misuse of prescription opioids during the past year (a decrease from 12.5 million in 2015), and 1.4 million met criteria for a past-year prescription opioid use disorder (a decrease from 2.0 million in 2015). However, in 2020, prescription opioids remained the most commonly misused prescription drug in the United States. Also in 2020, among those reporting misuse during the past year, 64.6% reported the main reason for their most recent misuse was to "relieve physical pain" compared with 11.3% to "feel good or get high" and 2.3% "because I am hooked or have to have it". Taken together, these factors underscore the need for an updated clinical practice guideline on appropriate opioid prescribing for pain and pain management.

### Transition from acute to chronic pain after surgery [^c7e78f70]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Over the past decade there has been an increasing reliance on strong opioids to treat acute and chronic pain, which has been associated with a rising epidemic of prescription opioid misuse, abuse, and overdose-related deaths. Deaths from prescription opioids have more than quadrupled in the USA since 1999, and this pattern is now occurring globally. Inappropriate opioid prescribing after surgery, particularly after discharge, is a major cause of this problem. Chronic postsurgical pain, occurring in approximately 10% of patients who have surgery, typically begins as acute postoperative pain that is difficult to control, but soon transitions into a persistent pain condition with neuropathic features that are unresponsive to opioids. Research into how and why this transition occurs has led to a stronger appreciation of opioid-induced hyperalgesia, use of more effective and safer opioid-sparing analgesic regimens, and non-pharmacological interventions for pain management. This Series provides an overview of the epidemiology and societal effect, basic science, and current recommendations for managing persistent postsurgical pain. We discuss the advances in the prevention of this transitional pain state, with the aim to promote safer analgesic regimens to better manage patients with acute and chronic pain.

Acute non–low back musculoskeletal injury pain — opioid therapy, including tramadol — is linked to a conditional recommendation with low-certainty evidence, and evidence shows limited short-term benefit with meaningful harms: high-certainty evidence showed acetaminophen plus opioids reduced pain at 1 to 7 days and also at less than 2 hours (the latter small and not clinically important), while moderate- to high-certainty evidence indicated opioid interventions were associated with large increases in risk for neurologic and GI adverse effects; observational data show continued prescription opioid use over the long term in 27% among high-risk populations and 6% among the general population, with longer prescription periods (> 7 days vs 1 to 3 days) and higher morphine milligram equivalents per day predicting prolonged use.

### Guidance on the management of pain in older people [^8788de67]. Age and Ageing (2013). Low credibility.

This guidance document reviews the epidemiology and management of pain in older people via a literature review of published research. The aim of this document is to inform health professionals in any care setting who work with older adults on best practice for the management of pain and to identify where there are gaps in the evidence that require further research. The assessment of pain in older people has not been covered within this guidance and can be found in a separate document (http://www.britishpainsociety.org/pub_professional.htm#assessmentpop). Substantial differences in the population, methods and definitions used in published research makes it difficult to compare across studies and impossible to determine the definitive prevalence of pain in older people. There are inconsistencies within the literature as to whether or not pain increases or decreases in this age group, and whether this is influenced by gender. There is, however, some evidence that the prevalence of pain is higher within residential care settings. The three most common sites of pain in older people are the back; leg/knee or hip and 'other' joints. In common with the working-age population, the attitudes and beliefs of older people influence all aspects of their pain experience. Stoicism is particularly evident within this cohort of people. Evidence from the literature search suggests that paracetamol should be considered as first-line treatment for the management of both acute and persistent pain, particularly that which is of musculoskeletal origin, due to its demonstrated efficacy and good safety profile. There are few absolute contraindications and relative cautions to prescribing paracetamol. It is, however, important that the maximum daily dose (4 g/24 h) is not exceeded. Non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be used with caution in older people after other safer treatments have not provided sufficient pain relief. The lowest dose should be provided, for the shortest duration. For older adults, an NSAID or cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) selective inhibitor should be co-prescribed with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI), and the one with the lowest acquisition cost should be chosen. All older people taking NSAIDs should be routinely monitored for gastrointestinal, renal and cardiovascular side effects, and drug–drug and drug–disease interactions. Opioid therapy may be considered for patients with moderate or severe pain, particularly if the pain is causing functional impairment or is reducing their quality of life. However, this must be individualised and carefully monitored. Opioid side effects including nausea and vomiting should be anticipated and suitable prophylaxis considered. Appropriate laxative therapy, such as the combination of a stool softener and a stimulant laxative, should be prescribed throughout treatment for all older people who are prescribed opioid therapy. Tricyclic antidepressants and anti-epileptic drugs have demonstrated efficacy in several types of neuropathic pain. But, tolerability and adverse effects limit their use in an older population. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections in osteoarthritis of the knee are effective in relieving pain in the short term, with little risk of complications and/or joint damage. Intra-articular hyaluronic acid is effective and free of systemic adverse effects. It should be considered in patients who are intolerant to systemic therapy. Intra-articular hyaluronic acid appears to have a slower onset of action than intra-articular steroids, but the effects seem to last longer. The current evidence for the use of epidural steroid injections in the management of sciatica is conflicting and, until further larger studies become available, no firm recommendations can be made. There is, however, a limited body of evidence to support the use of epidural injections in spinal stenosis. The literature review suggests that assistive devices are widely used and that the ownership of devices increases with age. Such devices enable older people with chronic pain to live in the community. However, they do not necessarily reduce pain and can increase pain if used incorrectly. Increasing activity by way of exercise should be considered. This should involve strengthening, flexibility, endurance and balance, along with a programme of education. Patient preference should be given serious consideration. A number of complementary therapies have been found to have some efficacy among the older population, including acupuncture, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and massage. Such approaches can affect pain and anxiety and are worth further investigation. Some psychological approaches have been found to be useful for the older population, including guided imagery, biofeedback training and relaxation. There is also some evidence supporting the use of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) among nursing home populations, but of course these approaches require training and time. There are many areas that require further research, including pharmacological management where approaches are often tested in younger populations and then translated across. Prevalence studies need consistency in terms of age, diagnosis and terminology, and further work needs to be done on evaluating non-pharmacological approaches.

Standard Pharmacological Treatment of Acute Trauma Pain

Current options for the management of acute pain in trauma settings include a plethora of different opioid and non-opioid drugs, available in many formulations and administered via different routes (Table 1). The choice of the most appropriate pain management strategy should take into consideration pain severity, setting (e.g. ED – pre-hospital – hostile environment), patient's characteristics, and availability of drugs and/or personnel able to prescribe and administer analgesics.

Commonly Used Pharmacological Treatments for Acute Trauma Pain*

There is no consolidated pain management practice throughout Europe, and treatment choice may vary greatly between countries and even within the same country, based on Regional or institutional guidelines. The Guidelines for the management of acute pain in emergency situations recently released by the European Society for Emergency Medicine (EUSEM) may help unify pain management strategies and grant patients access to pain relief.

### CDC clinical practice guideline for prescribing opioids for pain-United States, 2022 [^c0738235]. MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2022). Medium credibility.

Pain Management for Patients with Opioid Use Disorder

Although identification of an opioid use disorder can alter the expected benefits and risks of opioid therapy for pain, patients with co-occurring pain and substance use disorder require ongoing pain management that maximizes benefits relative to risks. Clinicians should use nonpharmacologic and nonopioid pharmacologic pain treatments as appropriate (see Recommendations 1 and 2) to provide optimal pain management. For patients with pain who have an active opioid use disorder but are not in treatment, clinicians should consider buprenorphine or methadone treatment for opioid use disorder, which also can help with concurrent management of pain. For patients who are treated with buprenorphine for opioid use disorder and experience acute pain, clinicians can consider temporarily increasing the buprenorphine dosing frequency (e.g. to twice per day) to help manage pain because the duration of effects of buprenorphine is shorter for pain than for suppression of withdrawal. For severe acute pain (e.g. from trauma or unplanned major surgery) in patients receiving buprenorphine for opioid use disorder, clinicians can consider additional as-needed doses of buprenorphine. In supervised settings, adding a short-acting full agonist opioid to the patient's regular dosage of buprenorphine can be considered without discontinuing the patient's regular buprenorphine dosage; however, if a decision is made to discontinue buprenorphine to allow for more µ -opioid receptor availability, patients should be monitored closely because high doses of a full agonist opioid might be required, potentially leading to oversedation and respiratory depression as buprenorphine's partial agonist effect lessens. For patients receiving naltrexone for opioid use disorder, short-term use of higher-potency nonopioid analgesics (e.g. NSAIDs) can be considered to manage severe acute pain. Patients receiving methadone for opioid use disorder who require additional opioids as treatment for severe acute pain management should be monitored carefully, and when feasible, should optimally be treated by a clinician experienced in the treatment of pain in consultation with their opioid treatment program. The ASAM National Practice Guideline for the Treatment of Opioid Use Disorder (2020 Focused Update) provides additional recommendations (see Part 9) for the management of patients receiving medications for opioid use disorder who have planned surgeries for which nonopioid therapies are not anticipated to provide sufficient pain relief.

Opioid use and nonpharmacologic strategies in the emergency department emphasize that patients with a history of chronic opioid use or SUD often have greater analgesic needs than opioid-naïve patients, and providers should not withhold opioids solely due to a history of SUD. Protocols need to include pain assessment and management strategies while accounting for hemodynamic status and prioritizing resuscitation, and prioritize nonpharmacologic techniques for pain management when possible.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^e951931a]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Opioid use disorder (OUD) — acute pain management in outpatient and inpatient settings: If pharmacological treatment is considered, non-opioid analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]) and non-opioid medications with pain modulating properties should be tried first. For patients with pain who have an active OUD but are not in treatment, methadone or buprenorphine should be considered, and the patient's OUD and pain should be stabilized and managed concurrently. For patients taking methadone or buprenorphine for OUD, temporarily increasing the dose or dosing frequency may be effective for pain. For patients taking methadone who have acute pain refractory to other treatments and require additional opioid-based analgesia, adding a short acting full agonist opioid to the regular methadone dose can be considered, with doses anticipated to be higher than in opioid-naïve individuals. Patients receiving buprenorphine who have moderate to severe acute pain refractory to other treatments may benefit from as-needed buprenorphine doses. The addition of a short-acting full agonist opioid to the patient's regular dose of buprenorphine can be effective for severe acute pain in supervised settings (e.g., hospitalization), and the dose is anticipated to be higher than typical in opioid‑naïve individuals; the committee was unable to come to consensus on whether this adjunct can be safely prescribed in ambulatory care settings.

Pain management at hospital discharge — opioid selection and overdose risk mitigation: When an opioid pill is used alone or in combination with acetaminophen or ibuprofen, no difference in efficacy, tolerability, or risk of abuse or misuse was found. To optimize the use of acetaminophen or NSAIDS before opioids, prescribe oral opioids alone to eliminate confusion about the maximum dose of the nonopioid component when used in combination form. For patients believed to require longer prescription duration, consider consultation with a pain management service for delineation of an optimal outpatient pain management regimen. In line with Centers for Disease Control recommendations, consider providing naloxone as a co-prescription for patients felt to be at high risk for opioid overdose.

### Opioid prescribing for acute pain management in children and adolescents in outpatient settings: clinical practice guideline [^62fbd3d6]. Pediatrics (2024). High credibility.

Optimizing nonpharmacologic approaches and nonopioid medications — outpatient pediatric acute pain: For a patient with mild-to-moderate pain, the PHCP should start nonopioid medications and treatment, and these strategies should be optimized before considering an opioid. If the patient has severe pain or severe pain is anticipated, an opioid can be started at the same time as nonopioid analgesics, and the use of opioids should be reassessed regularly and weaned as tolerated. Recent guidelines highlight that opioids are not necessary following many common pediatric surgeries. For patients with physical, developmental, or intellectual disabilities, PHCPs should take time to carefully assess pain, family members and others who know the child or adolescent can provide additional information to guide pain management, and behavioral pain assessment scales that incorporate parent and caregiver input are available and have been validated in individuals with neurocognitive impairment. The optimal approach starts with educating patients and families on nonpharmacologic strategies, setting realistic expectations that focus on keeping pain at a tolerable level, and counseling that some pain may persist even despite effective treatment. Nonpharmacologic analgesic strategies include ice or heat, massage, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, keeping the injured area above heart level to minimize swelling, and music therapy.

### Vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease: current paradigm on pain management [^97f1ebd1]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Pharmacologic treatment involves the use of non-opioid analgesics, opioid analgesics, and adjuvants – either singly or in combination – depending on the severity of pain. The basic approach remains the symptomatic treatment of pain with escalating doses of non-opioid and opioid analgesics. However, using non-opioid analgesics during an acute exacerbation of pain may also limit escalation of opioid doses. In addition, modifying the adhesiveness of sickle cells to inflamed endothelium may potentially reduce vaso-occlusive crisis. Nevertheless, careful assessment of painful episodes should precede and follow all the available options for manag ing this type of crisis. The choice, route, dose, and frequency of administration of opioids should depend on the patient's presentation. To achieve effective pain treatment, opioids can either be administered on a fixed schedule or by patient-controlled analgesia. Given the moderate-to-severe nature of the pain usually experienced in vaso-occlusive crisis, opioids form the bedrock of pharmacologic treatment. However, adult patients who receive opioids more frequently for pain exhibit more disruption of their lives, with reduced activity levels and more pessimistic mood. Despite the choice of opioids for acute and chronic pain in SCD, concerns about narcotic addiction continue to pose a barrier to more effective analgesia, although evidence points to lack of addiction. The step 2 analgesics (weak opioid ± non-opioid ± adjuvants) or step 3 analgesics (strong opioid ± non-opioid ± adjuvants) are, nonetheless, applicable in most cases of SCD pain. In benchmarking pain outcomes in children with SCD, results revealed three areas to focus on to achieve improvement: enhanced pain assessment and documentation using valid pain tools; more aggressive multimodal management for peak vaso-occlusive pain; and better education and support for pain management at home. Multimodal analgesia appears to be the prerequisite for effective pain management in SCD. One study on home management of sickle cell pain among pediatric patients suggests that pain relief was substantially better for analgesic combinations than for single analgesics, especially for moderate-to-severe pain. Furthermore, opioid tolerance may develop from frequent emergency department (ED) visits and may constitute one of the several barriers to effective pain management; addressing these barriers to pain management for patients in crisis in the emergency setting may improve the quality of the administered pain management. Several studies have documented the effectiveness of both unimodal and multimodal analgesia with or without adjuvants in crisis-related pains (Table 1).

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^4c55c1b3]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

ASAM National Practice Guideline — opioid use disorder (OUD) with pain and perioperative management states that alternative treatments including nonopioid medications, behavioral approaches, physical therapy, and procedural approaches (e.g., regional anesthesia) should be considered before prescribing opioid medications for pain. For patients with pain who have an active OUD but are not on MAT, methadone or buprenorphine should be considered, and the patient's OUD and pain should be stabilized and managed concurrently. For patients taking methadone or buprenorphine, temporary increases in the dosing frequency (i.e., split dosing to maximize the analgesic properties of these medications) may be effective for managing pain. For patients taking methadone for OUD with acute pain refractory to other treatments, adding a short acting full agonist opioid to their regular dose of methadone can be considered to manage moderate to severe acute pain. For patients receiving buprenorphine for OUD with moderate to severe acute pain refractory to other treatments, addition of as needed doses of buprenorphine may be beneficial, and the addition of a short acting full agonist is not recommended outside of a supervised hospital setting. Discontinuation of methadone or buprenorphine before surgery is not required, and higher potency intravenous full agonists opioids can be used perioperatively for analgesia.

### Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for the management of acute dental pain [^476dd4ec]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

In the United States, on average, every 15 s, someone visits a hospital emergency department (ED) for a dental condition. This commentary summarizes the recommendations from a 2024 clinical practice guideline for the pharmacological management of acute dental pain associated with tooth extractions and toothache applicable to ED settings, hospitals, and urgent care clinics where definitive dental treatment is not immediately available.

Methods

A guideline panel convened by the American Dental Association, the ADA Science & Research Institute, the University of Pittsburgh School of Dental Medicine, and Penn Dental Medicine examined the effect of opioid and non-opioid analgesics; local anesthetics, including blocks; corticosteroids; and topical anesthetics on acute dental pain. The GRADE approach was used to assess the certainty of the evidence; the GRADE Evidence-to-Decision Framework was used to formulate 18 recommendations and six good practice statements.

Results

A beneficial net balance favors the use of non-opioid medications compared with opioid medications. When not contraindicated, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) alone or in combination with acetaminophen likely provide superior pain relief with a more favorable safety profile compared with opioids.

Conclusion

NSAIDs with or without acetaminophen are first-line therapy for managing acute dental pain following tooth extraction(s) and temporarily managing toothache. Opioids should be reserved for clinical situations when first-line therapy is insufficient or contraindications to NSAIDs exist.

### Acute pain management in morbid obesity-an evidence based clinical update [^24f417c0]. Surgery for Obesity and Related Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Increasing numbers of patients with morbid obesity are presenting for surgery and their acute pain management requires an evidence-based clinical update. The objective of this study was to complete a literature review for acute pain management in morbid obesity and provide an evidence-based clinical update with recommendations. Using standardized search terms, in March 2015, we completed a literature search to determine evidence for different acute pain pharmacological modalities in morbid obesity. For each modality the highest level of evidence was ascertained and recommendations for each pharmacological modality are presented. Though overall evidence is limited to few well conducted clinical trials, mostly related to weight loss surgery, multimodal analgesia with step-wise, severity-based, opioid-sparing approach appears to improve acute pain management in morbid obesity. The perioperative use of non-opioid adjuvants appears to offer further improvements in patient safety and outcomes. Further research into standardization of pain assessments and implementation of acute pain management protocols is required.

### Opioid prescribing for acute pain management in children and adolescents in outpatient settings: clinical practice guideline [^f7f65a56]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

This is the first clinical practice guideline (CPG) from the American Academy of Pediatrics outlining evidence-based approaches to safely prescribing opioids for acute pain in outpatient settings. The central goal is to aid clinicians in understanding when opioids may be indicated to treat acute pain in children and adolescents and how to minimize risks (including opioid use disorder, poisoning, and overdose). The document also seeks to alleviate disparate pain treatment of Black, Hispanic, and American Indian/Alaska Native children and adolescents, who receive pain management that is less adequate and less timely than that provided to white individuals. There may also be disparities in pain treatment based on language, socioeconomic status, geographic location, and other factors, which are discussed. The document recommends that clinicians treat acute pain using a multimodal approach that includes the appropriate use of nonpharmacologic therapies, nonopioid medications, and, when needed, opioid medications. Opioids should not be prescribed as monotherapy for children or adolescents who have acute pain. When using opioids for acute pain management, clinicians should prescribe immediate-release opioid formulations, start with the lowest age- and weight-appropriate doses, and provide an initial supply of 5 or fewer days, unless the pain is related to trauma or surgery with expected duration of pain longer than 5 days. Clinicians should not prescribe codeine or tramadol for patients younger than 12 years; adolescents 12 to 18 years of age who have obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, or severe lung disease; to treat postsurgical pain after tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy in patients younger than 18 years; or for any breastfeeding patient. The CPG recommends providing opioids when appropriate for treating acutely worsened pain in children and adolescents who have a history of chronic pain; clinicians should partner with other opioid-prescribing clinicians involved in the patient's care and/or a specialist in chronic pain or palliative care to determine an appropriate treatment plan. Caution should be used when treating acute pain in those who are taking sedating medications. The CPG describes potential harms of discontinuing or rapidly tapering opioids in individuals who have been on stable, long-term opioids to treat chronic pain. The guideline also recommends providing naloxone and information on naloxone, safe storage and disposal of opioids, and direct observation of medication administration. Clinicians are encouraged to help caregivers develop a plan for safe disposal. The CPG contains 12 key action statements based on evidence from randomized controlled trials, high-quality observational studies, and, when studies are lacking or could not feasibly or ethically be conducted, from expert opinion. Each key action statement includes a level of evidence, the benefit-harm relationship, and the strength of recommendation.

### Evidence and consensus recommendations for the pharmacological management of pain in India [^84005a77]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Duration of pain

Duration of pain is a decisive factor guiding the choice of an appropriate analgesic regimen. However, duration of pain should always be correlated with the pain intensity.
Acute pain The primary pain management goal here is early intervention to reduce the pain to acceptable levels. Most of the acute pain is nociceptive and treatment for acute pain involves a combination of paracetamol, opioids and some topical agents. Mild somatic acute pain could be treated with paracetamol, NSAIDs, topical anesthetics and physical treatments such as ice, compression and so on. For acute visceral pain, NSAIDs, opioids, corticosteroids and agents modulating the central neuronal activity (TRPV1 antagonists) may be used, depending on the underlying comorbidity. For moderate-to-severe pain, a combination of opioids and nonopioids could offer optimal pain relief. In cases of pain from trauma or surgical procedures, systemic medication would have to be administered.
Chronic pain Management goals for chronic pain include reducing the suffering due to pain and the associated emotional distress, in addition to increasing the coping ability and psychosocial well-being of the patient, by targeting the hypersensitive nervous system. Multimodal therapy involving a combination of treatments is recommended for treatment of chronic cancer or noncancer pain. The treatment for CNCP could include nonopioids (paracetamol, NSAIDs and selective COX-2 inhibitors), opioids, analgesics, TCAs, corticosteroids, muscle relaxants, sedatives and anxiolytics.
Nociceptive pain Nociceptive pain is generally time limited as the pain resolves when the tissue damage heals, but it may also be persistent when associated with inflammatory disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis. Treatment for localized pain should be started with the use of topical or oral NSAIDs. Moderate-to-severe pain unresponsive to NSAIDs may be treated with opioids to manage symptoms and control inflammation. Additionally, corticosteroids and immune-modulating agents (biologics) can also be used to manage inflammation in arthritic pain.
Neuropathic pain Peripheral neuropathic pain manifests as stimulus-independent pain or stimulus-evoked pain (pain hypersensitivity triggered by a stimulus following damage to sensory neurons). Neuropathic pain may persist for months or years beyond the normal healing time of any damaged tissues. Evidence from randomized controlled studies (RCTs) and systematic reviews have confirmed the efficacy of TCAs (amitriptyline and nortriptyline), antiseizure medications (pregabalin, gabapentin and carbamazepine) and opioids in the treatment of various neuropathic conditions.–Evidence supports the use of opioids as second- or third-line therapies for neuropathic pain, particularly of peripheral origin (Table S1) (A). However, further confirmation from well-controlled studies is warranted to establish the efficacy of these agents in complex neuropathies.
Mild, moderate and severe pain Treatment recommendations are also dependent on the severity of pain. Acetaminophen and other mild NSAIDs such as aspirin are the preferred treatment for mild chronic pain and may be used to supplement other agents in treating mild-to-moderate pain. However, acetaminophen lacks anti-inflammatory effects, limiting its use in pain associated with inflammatory diseases such as arthritis. NSAIDs are recommended for periodic flare-ups of mild-to-moderate inflammatory or nonneuropathic pain. For management of persistent moderate-to-severe pain, opioid therapy is the most sought-after treatment. Opioids are considered effective in the treatment of neuropathic pain that is not responsive to initial therapies, but not in the treatment of inflammatory, mechanical or compressive pain. Certain strong opioids, however, do not necessarily improve functional or psychological status and should be administered under adequate supervision.–

### Perioperative pain management and cancer outcomes: a narrative review [^8ed05a63]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Cancer-related pain is one of the most common and incapacitating symptoms for cancer patients. Cancer pain can be caused by diagnostic or therapeutic procedures, side effects and toxicity from therapy, or the cancer itself. Uncontrolled cancer-related pain is associated with inadequate quality of life and reduced functional status. Optimal pain management during the perioperative period requires a tailored approach. Interventions that are recommended for the management of acute surgical pain include regional anesthesia, local anesthetic infusions, non-opioid analgesics (ketamine, dexmedetomidine, lidocaine, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), and opioids. Despite continued research efforts and advances in cancer treatment, opioids remain the most effective medication to treat moderate to severe cancer-related pain; however, their role has been changing significantly due to the opioid epidemic and opioid misuse. While pre-clinical and retrospective studies have shown a negative association between opioid use and cancer outcomes, randomized control trials have failed to confirm this association. The purpose of this review is to summarize the pharmacological management of acute cancer-related pain during the perioperative period with an emphasis on cancer recurrence.

### Evidence and consensus recommendations for the pharmacological management of pain in India [^ddbaa173]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Despite enormous progress in the field of pain management over the recent years, pain continues to be a highly prevalent medical condition worldwide. In the developing countries, pain is often an undertreated and neglected aspect of treatment. Awareness issues and several misconceptions associated with the use of analgesics, fear of adverse events - particularly with opioids and surgical methods of analgesia - are major factors contributing to suboptimal treatment of pain. Untreated pain, as a consequence, is associated with disability, loss of income, unemployment and considerable mortality; besides contributing majorly to the economic burden on the society and the health care system in general. Available guidelines suggest that a strategic treatment approach may be helpful for physicians in managing pain in real-world settings. The aim of this manuscript is to propose treatment recommendations for the management of different types of pain, based on the available evidence. Evidence search was performed by using MEDLINE (by PubMed) and Cochrane databases. The types of articles included in this review were based on randomized control studies, case-control or cohort studies, prospective and retrospective studies, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, clinical practice guidelines and evidence-based consensus recommendations. Articles were reviewed by a multidisciplinary expert panel and recommendations were developed. A stepwise treatment algorithm-based approach based on a careful diagnosis and evaluation of the underlying disease, associated comorbidities and type/duration of pain is proposed to assist general practitioners, physicians and pain specialists in clinical decision making.

### Comprehensive, evidence-based, consensus guidelines for prescription of opioids for chronic non-cancer pain from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^4a02d4a2]. Pain Physician (2023). High credibility.

Opioid therapy for chronic non-cancer pain — guideline scope, limitations, and conclusion are stated as follows: The consensus guidelines included 4 sections specific to opioid therapy with 1) ten recommendations particular to initial steps of opioid therapy; 2) five recommendations for assessment of effectiveness of opioid therapy; 3) three recommendations regarding monitoring adherence and side effects; and 4) two general, final phase recommendations. Limitations note a continued paucity of literature of long-term opioid therapy addressing chronic non-cancer pain and significant biases leading to highly variable rules and regulations across various states. Consequently, it was concluded – and herein recommended – that chronic opioid therapy should be provided in low doses with appropriate adherence monitoring and understanding of adverse events only to those patients with a proven medical necessity, and who exhibit stable improvement in both pain relief and activities of daily function, either independently or in conjunction with other modalities of treatments. The guidelines presented are based upon the best available evidence, and do not constitute or represent inflexible treatment recommendations and are not intended to be regarded and/or used as a "standard of care".

### Management of chronic pain in the acute care setting [^d3ea20f1]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Chronic nonmalignant pain requires evaluation and treatment different from acute pain. The pathophysiology is different, and there is commonly some degree of psychosocial dysfunction. Opioids tend to be much less effective as analgesics for chronic pain, and may increase the sensitivity to pain when given long-term. Because they are self-reinforcing, opioids may be sought and be reported to improve chronic pain, even when they may make the condition worse over time. There are many effective alternatives to opioids for the treatment of chronic pain, but their use is complicated and may require considerable time and effort to determine which ones work. Patients, particularly those who have already been prescribed opioids, may resist these alternatives. An extensive physical and psychosocial evaluation is required in the management of chronic pain, which is difficult if not impossible to achieve in the emergency or urgent care settings. Consequently, emergency and urgent care physicians should work closely with the patient's pain management specialist or personal physician. Systems should be set up in advance to identify those patients whose frequent use of acute care services for obtaining opioids may be compromising their long-term management, putting themselves at risk for psychological and tolerance-induced adverse effects of frequent opioid use. Opioids may be used in carefully selected patients in consultation with their pain management specialist or personal physician, but care must be exercised not to initiate or exacerbate psychological or tolerance-related complications of chronic pain.

### Strategy for effective analgesia with intravenous buprenorphine in patients with acute postoperative pain [^5ed60f8e]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Analgesic treatment is the primary method for managing acute postoperative pain. Opioid analgesics are the main class of drugs used to treat moderate to severe pain, whether it is acute or chronic. These opioids differ in various ways, including their pharmacochemical properties, distribution and absorption rates, metabolism, and elimination pathways for the drug and its metabolites. These differences result in varying degrees of analgesic efficacy, which, in clinical practice, allows for the selection of the most effective drug that maximizes pain relief while ensuring safety. Buprenorphine is a semi-synthetic opioid with properties that are not yet fully understood. It has a wide range of applications in treating both acute and chronic pain, including non-cancer and cancer-related pain. One of the most significant clinical advantages of buprenorphine is its safety profile, which includes a ceiling effect on respiratory depression, no immunosuppressive effects, inhibition of hyperalgesia, no cumulative effects in patients with renal failure, and a low risk of constipation following its use.

Aim

This study aims to analyze current reports on the use of intravenous buprenorphine as a first-line opioid analgesic for postoperative pain relief. The paper discusses the pharmacochemical properties of the drug and the mechanisms behind postoperative pain. Additionally, it presents the experiences of the pain management team at Copernicus Hospital in Gdansk regarding administering intravenous buprenorphine.

Material and Methods

The current literature on buprenorphine for treating moderate to severe acute pain has been reviewed, focusing on its effectiveness in managing postoperative pain following surgical procedures. Additionally, the experience of the Copernicus Hospital pain team with buprenorphine is summarized in a brief discussion.

Conclusion

After reviewing current literature and recommendations, along with the experiences of the pain management team at Copernicus Hospital in Gdańsk, it can be concluded that buprenorphine is an analgesic that demonstrates a high level of efficacy and safety. When used in combination with non-opioid analgesics, buprenorphine achieves a synergistic effect, resulting in effective pain relief. This approach facilitates early patient rehabilitation and enables a swift return to normal activities, even following extensive surgical procedures.

### Poorly controlled postoperative pain: prevalence, consequences, and prevention [^18446b87]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Surgery and anesthesia are critical health-care services that reduce the risk of death and disability among millions worldwide each year, and the need for these services is expected to continue to increase over the next decade. Globally, nearly 313 million operations were performed in 2012, whereas in the US an estimated 28 million inpatient surgical procedures and 48 million ambulatory surgeries were reported in 2006 and 2010, respectively. Although possibly life-saving, surgery is also associated with potential harm, which frequently includes pain during and after the procedure. Despite improved understanding of pain mechanisms, increased awareness of the prevalence of postsurgical pain, advances in pain-management approaches, and other focused initiatives aimed at improving pain-related outcomes in recent decades, inadequately controlled postoperative pain continues to be a widespread, unresolved health-care problem.

Suboptimal acute-pain management in surgery patients is accompanied by an array of negative consequences, including increased morbidity, impaired physical function and quality of life, slowed recovery, prolonged opioid use during and after hospitalization, and increased cost of care. In addition, early postoperative pain appears to trigger persistent pain that may last for months after surgery in a substantial proportion of patients. To prevent the progression from acute to chronic postoperative pain, more aggressive analgesic/anesthetic measures are needed to reduce the incidence and intensity of acute pain during and immediately after surgery. Although research on preventive interventions is limited, some promising results have been reported in studies of local anesthetics and nonopioid analgesics.–In addition, a new class of opioid analgesics – selective agonists at the μ-opioid receptor – with a potentially expanded therapeutic window compared with conventional, unselective opioid therapies is currently in development.–In early-phase studies, the μ-receptor G-protein pathway-selective modulator oliceridine produced comparable but more rapid pain relief than morphine and fewer opioid-related adverse events (AEs), suggesting potential benefits in the prevention of postsurgical pain.

In this review, we examine the prevalence of poorly controlled acute postoperative pain and the major factors that may predict its occurrence. In addition, the consequences of inadequate pain management after surgery are described, with an emphasis on the potential development of chronic pain. Finally, we present findings from clinical studies of treatment approaches that may control acute postoperative pain more effectively, prevent its negative effects on patients' health, function, and quality of life, and reduce the risk of progression to persistent pain.

Nonopioid Medications for Acute Pain

Many acute pain conditions often can be managed most effectively with nonopioid medications. A systematic review found that for musculoskeletal injuries such as sprains, whiplash, and muscle strains, topical NSAIDs provided the greatest benefit-harm ratio, followed by oral NSAIDs or acetaminophen with or without diclofenac. NSAIDs have been found to be more effective than opioids for surgical dental pain and kidney stone pain and similarly effective to opioids for low back pain. Evidence is limited on comparative effectiveness of therapies for acute neuropathic pain, neck pain, and postoperative pain. For episodic migraine, triptans, NSAIDs, antiemetics, dihydroergotamine, calcitonin gene-related peptide antagonists (gepants), and lasmiditan are associated with improved pain and function with usually mild and transient adverse events.

ACP recommends NSAIDs or skeletal muscle relaxants if pharmacologic treatment is desired to treat low back pain. For acute musculoskeletal injuries other than low back pain, ACP and AAFP recommend topical NSAIDs with or without menthol gel as first-line therapy and suggest oral NSAIDs to relieve pain or improve function or oral acetaminophen to reduce pain. The American Dental Association (ADA) recommends NSAIDs as first-line treatment for acute dental pain management. For acute kidney stone pain, NSAIDs are at least as effective as opioids, can decrease the ureteral smooth muscle tone and ureteral spasm causing kidney stone pain, and are preferred for kidney stone pain if not contraindicated. Triptans, NSAIDs, combined triptans with NSAIDs, antiemetics, dihydroergotamine, and acetaminophen are established acute treatments for migraine. Lasmiditan, an 5-HT1F receptor agonist, and ubrogepant, a gepant, were approved by FDA in 2019 for the treatment of migraine; another gepant, rimegepant, was approved in 2020. Lasmiditan and the gepants were more effective than placebo in providing pain relief at 2 hours, 1 day, and 1 week. Adverse events related to these newer medications require further study; however, their mechanisms of action are believed to be nonvasoconstrictive and potentially carry lower risks than vasoactive medications in patients with cardiovascular risk factors.

Introduction

Opioids have traditionally been used for analgesia after trauma; however, misuse and abuse of opioids have reached epidemic proportions. In the last three decades, drug overdoses, largely due to opioids, have tripled. This public health crisis has led providers to consider alternative pharmaceuticals to control pain after trauma. Therefore, there is an upsurge in the interest of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) for acute pain control, particularly in trauma patients. However, the safety and efficacy of NSAIDs for acute pain control after fracture has not been well established, and debate remains about potential risks.

Traditionally, the most concerning adverse event related to NSAID use after orthopedic trauma is fracture non-union. Unfortunately, numerous attempts to study and quantify the relationship have led to conflicting results. Furthermore, alternative treatments to NSAIDs, including opioids, have demonstrated similar associations to non-union. A number of meta-analyses and systematic reviews have been performed in the non-trauma population with mixed results. It remains unclear whether increased pain medication (NSAIDs or opioids) directly increases rates of non-union or instead, the pain secondary to non-union increases the use of these medications. The risks and benefits of using NSAIDs for managing acute pain in patients with traumatic fractures remains unclear, and practices across North America vary greatly. The current Orthopedic Trauma Association (OTA) and American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons guidelines focus on acute musculoskeletal injuries and only explore fracture healing and do not discuss other potential harms such as acute kidney injury.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to develop evidenced-based recommendations to determine whether NSAIDs were safe and effective in patients with traumatic fractures, following the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodologyon behalf of Eastern Association for The Surgery of Trauma (EAST) and the OTA.

### Predictors of opioid prescription among a sample of patients with acute musculoskeletal pain at a tertiary care hospital in Saudi Arabia [^b46cbafd]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Although multiple non-pharmacologic treatments, such as physiotherapy and acupuncture, are used in the management of musculoskeletal pain, pharmacotherapy (eg, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), selective COX-2 inhibitors, oral and injectable corticosteroids, and opioids) remains the mainstay of musculoskeletal pain treatment. Opioids are the most commonly prescribed analgesics used in the management of acute musculoskeletal pain. Nearly 90% of patients who visit pain clinics in the United Kingdom are prescribed some forms of opioid analgesics. Although opioids are deemed to be the most effective analgesics in the management of acute musculoskeletal pain, their use is associated with higher risk of abuse, misuse, and serious adverse events. Therefore, the lowest effective dose of opioids should be used for the shortest appropriate period of time whenever needed in the management of musculoskeletal pain. Additionally, it was found that the early use of opioids in the management of both acute and chronic musculoskeletal pain has been associated poorer clinical outcomes especially in the case of low back pain according to a recently published systematic review of clinical practice guidelines. However, another systematic review and meta-analysis has found that the use of opioids in the management of low back pain is associated with greater pain relief in the short term, but this effect was not observed in the long term.
