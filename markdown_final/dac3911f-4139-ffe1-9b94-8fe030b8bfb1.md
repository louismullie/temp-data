## Question

Who was studied in EXSCEL and over what time frame, and how many primary outcome events occurred in each group?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking who was studied in EXSCEL, over what time frame, and how many primary outcome events occurred in each group. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the study design and population. Then, I should verify the exact time frame and follow-up. Next, I will confirm the primary outcome definition and extract the event counts by arm. Finally, I should double-check the hazard ratio and statistical interpretation to ensure accuracy before concluding.

> Let me first confirm the study and population. EXSCEL was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcomes trial that enrolled 14,752 adults with type 2 diabetes, with or without established cardiovascular disease, across 687–688 sites in 35 countries, targeting about 70% with prior CVD and allowing usual background diabetes therapy except GLP-1 receptor agonists, which were excluded [^112hYdia] [^115vVZ8z] [^114PzQ66].

> Wait, let me verify the time frame. Enrollment ran from June 2010 to September 2015, and participants were followed for a median of 3.2 years with an interquartile range of 2.2 to 4.4 years; the FDA label also notes a median follow-up of 38.7 months, which aligns with the NEJM figure when converted, so I should cite both to capture the peer-reviewed and regulatory perspectives [^116r6mYC] [^112hYdia] [^112EacDv].

> I need to check the intervention and randomization. Patients were randomized 1:1 to once-weekly extended-release exenatide 2 mg subcutaneously versus matching placebo, with background antihyperglycemic therapy managed per usual care and no mandated cardiovascular risk-factor optimization, reflecting a pragmatic design [^112hYdia] [^116r6mYC].

> Next, I should review the primary outcome and event counts. The primary composite outcome was the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. In the intention-to-treat analysis, 839 of 7,356 patients (11.4%) in the exenatide group and 905 of 7,396 patients (12.2%) in the placebo group experienced a primary outcome event, corresponding to 3.7 and 4.0 events per 100 patient-years, respectively [^112hYdia] [^116r6mYC].

> Hold on, I should verify the statistical interpretation. The hazard ratio for the primary composite outcome was 0.91 with a 95% CI of 0.83 to 1.00; exenatide met noninferiority for cardiovascular safety (P < 0.001), but superiority for efficacy was not achieved (P = 0.06), which is consistent across the NEJM publication and the FDA label [^112hYdia] [^112EacDv].

> Let me consider the broader context briefly to ensure I'm not overstating anything. EXSCEL's pragmatic design, broad inclusion, and modest adherence have been cited as factors that may have attenuated the ability to demonstrate superiority, and meta-analytic syntheses of GLP-1 RA trials show class benefits for MACE and mortality even though EXSCEL itself did not meet superiority for the primary MACE endpoint, which helps frame the neutral primary result within the class evidence base [^115EgoBg] [^1136j2pJ].

The EXSCEL trial enrolled **14,752 adults with type 2 diabetes** [^112hYdia], with or without cardiovascular disease, from 35 countries [^115vVZ8z] between June 2010 and September 2015 [^116r6mYC]. Participants were followed for a **median of 3.2 years** (IQR 2.2–4.4) [^112hYdia]. The primary composite outcome (cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke) occurred in **839 patients (11.4%)** in the exenatide group and **905 patients (12.2%)** in the placebo group (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83–1.00; P < 0.001 for noninferiority; P = 0.06 for superiority) [^112hYdia] [^116r6mYC].

## Primary outcome events

| **Outcome** | **Exenatide group (n = 7,356)** | **Placebo group (n = 7,396)** | **Hazard ratio (95% ci)** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Primary composite outcome (CV death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke) | 839 events (11.4%) | 905 events (12.2%) | 0.91 (0.83–1.00) |
| Incidence rate | 3.7 per 100 patient-years | 4.0 per 100 patient-years | N/A |

Noninferiority was met (P < 0.001), but superiority was not (P = 0.06) [^112hYdia] [^116r6mYC].

---

## Secondary outcomes

- **All-cause mortality**: 6.9% exenatide vs 7.9% placebo (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77–0.97; nominal P = 0.016) [^112hYdia] [^116r6mYC].
- **Cardiovascular death**: 4.6% exenatide vs 5.2% placebo (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.76–1.02) [^112hYdia] [^114ybwBZ].

---

## Conclusion

EXSCEL showed that once-weekly exenatide was **noninferior to placebo** for major adverse cardiovascular events in adults with type 2 diabetes, with a modest reduction in all-cause mortality, but did not demonstrate superiority for the primary composite endpoint [^112hYdia] [^116r6mYC].

The study EXSCEL was published by Holman RR and colleagues in 2017 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the EXSCEL study, the trial question was: what is the effect of once-weekly exenatide on cardiovascular outcome in patients with T2DM? In the EXSCEL study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the EXSCEL study, the population was: 14752 patients (5603 female, 9149 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with T2DM, with or without previous CVD who are on medication. The key exclusion criteria were history of ≥ 2 episodes of severe hypoglycemia during the preceding 12 months, end-stage kidney disease, personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma or MEN2, or a previous treatment with a GLP-1 receptor agonist. In the EXSCEL study, the interventions were: n = 7356 exenatide (extended-release dose of 2 mg subcutaneous injection once weekly) n = 7396 placebo (matching placebo once weekly). In the EXSCEL study, the primary outcome was: difference not exceeding non-inferiority margin in death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke (11.4% vs. 12.2%; HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.83 to 1). In the EXSCEL study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in death from any cause (6.9% vs. 7.9%; HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.77 to 0.97) No significant difference in death from cardiovascular causes (4.6% vs. 5.2%; HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.02) No significant difference in hospitalization for HF (3% vs. 3.1%; HR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.13). In the EXSCEL study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in serious adverse events. In the EXSCEL study, the conclusion was: in patients with T2DM, with or without previous CVD who are on medication, exenatide was noninferior to placebo with respect to death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke.

The HR for the first occurrence of a CV event in the primary composite endpoint comparing exenatide with placebo was estimated using a Cox proportional hazards model stratified by baseline CV risk group and treatment group as a covariate. 12 Tests for non‐inferiority and superiority were conducted hierarchically, first testing for non‐inferiority then superiority for the primary composite endpoint. 12 A superiority test for the secondary outcome of all‐cause death was conducted only if non‐inferiority and superiority were significant for the primary composite endpoint. 12 Two formal interim efficacy analyses were planned to test for superiority (P < .0001 and P < .001) after 453 and 906 events, corresponding to one‐ and two‐thirds of the targeted 1360 primary CV events. 12 This design was to ensure a significance level of.0499 for the final analysis. 12

A total of 14 752 patients were randomized and 10 782 had established CVD (73.1%) with 3970 (26.9%) having CV risk factors, mirroring projections of a patient pool of 14 000 with 70% having established CVD. 12 There were 1744 primary composite outcome events observed, exceeding the minimum of 1360 needed to test EXSCEL's superiority and non‐inferiority hypotheses. 12 The incidence rate for MACE‐3 was 3.7 and 4.0 events/100 patient‐years for exenatide and placebo, respectively, exceeding the 2.2% assumed for testing EXSCEL's primary outcomes. 12 Primary composite outcome events occurred in 839 and 905 patients treated with exenatide or placebo, respectively; exenatide showed non‐inferiority to placebo with respect to safety, but not superiority to placebo with respect to efficacy (HR 0.91, 95% CI [0.83, 1.00]; P < .001 and P = 0.06, respectively). 12 Among other factors, EXSCEL's pragmatic design, shorter follow‐up, duration of treatment regimen exposure and lower baseline HbA1c compared with LEADER may have contributed to its lack of observed CV efficacy. 12 Compared with other GLP‐1 RA CVOTs, EXSCEL had low treatment regimen compliance (exenatide, 76.0%; placebo, 75.0%), defined as the duration of time that patients received the trial regimen relative to the duration of time that they were expected to receive the regimen during the trial. 12

Methods

The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. EXSCEL enrolled 14 752 patients at 687 sites in 35 countries between June 2010 and September 2015. Trial design, baseline characteristics, and primary results have been published. 1, 2, 3 In brief, EXSCEL investigated the effects of the once‐weekly GLP‐1 receptor agonist, exenatide (2‐mg injection), on cardiovascular‐related outcomes in T2DM. The study included patients with a hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 6.5% to 10% at any level of cardiovascular risk and targeted ≈70% with a previous cardiovascular event, including previous coronary, cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular events or stenosis. Patients aged < 18 years, with type 1 diabetes mellitus, ≥ 2 episodes of severe hypoglycemia in the previous 12 months, an estimated glomerular filtration rate < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, or previous pancreatitis were excluded. Median (interquartile range) age of the population was 62 years (56, 68), 38% were female, and median baseline HbA1c was 8.0% (7.3, 8.9). Median follow‐up was 3.2 years (2.2, 4.4), with a median duration of drug treatment exposure of 2.4 years (1.4, 3.8) in the exenatide group and 2.3 years (1.2, 3.6) in the placebo group. The primary composite end point of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and nonfatal stroke occurred in 11.4% (839 of 7356) of the exenatide group and 12.2% (905/7396) of the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.83–1.00). Exenatide was noninferior to placebo for safety (P < 0.001 for noninferiority), but was not superior to placebo with respect to efficacy (P = 0.061 for superiority). The secondary outcome of ACM occurred in 6.9% (507 of 7356) of exenatide patients and 7.9% (584 of 7396) of placebo patients (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.77–0.97; nominal P = 0.016).

### Baseline characteristics of patients enrolled in the exenatide study of cardiovascular event lowering (EXSCEL) [^115vVZ8z]. American Heart Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Background

EXSCEL is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial examining the effect of exenatide once-weekly (EQW) versus placebo on time to the primary composite outcome (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or nonfatal stroke) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and a wide range of cardiovascular (CV) risk.

Methods

Patients were enrolled at 688 sites in 35 countries. We describe their baseline characteristics according to prior CV event status and compare patients with those enrolled in prior glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) outcomes trials.

Results

Of a total of 14,752 participants randomized between June 2010 and September 2015, 6,788 (46.0%) patients were enrolled in Europe; 3,708 (25.1%), North America; 2,727 (18.5%), Latin America; and 1,529 (10.4%), Asia Pacific. Overall, 73% had at least one prior CV event (70% coronary artery disease, 24% peripheral arterial disease, 22% cerebrovascular disease). The median (IQR) age was 63 years (56, 69), 38% were female, median baseline HbA1c was 8.0% (7.3, 8.9) and 16% had a prior history of heart failure. Those without a prior CV event were younger with a shorter duration of diabetes and better renal function than those with at least one prior CV event. Compared with prior GLP-1RA trials, EXSCEL has a larger percentage of patients without a prior CV event and a notable percentage who were taking a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor at baseline (15%).

Conclusions

EXSCEL is one of the largest global GLP-1RA trials, evaluating the safety and efficacy of EQW with a broad patient population that may extend generalizability compared to prior GLP-1RA trials (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01144338).

EXSCEL

Before the EXSCEL trial was completed, the exploratory results from a large uncontrolled study population of 39,275 patients suggested that patients treated with exenatide twice daily had a significantly lower rate of cardiovascular events and hospitalisations than patients treated with other glucose-lowering medications. In contrast to these preliminary findings, the results from the subsequent randomised, placebo-controlled EXSCEL trial failed to demonstrate a cardiovascular advantage. The EXSCEL trial enrolled the largest and most inclusive patient population of any cardiovascular outcome trial of the GLP-1RA class. In T2DM patients with an elevated cardiovascular risk, exenatide 2 mg weekly was compared with placebo. EXSCEL was unique in the inclusion of patients with a broad range of cardiovascular risks, including 26.9% without known cardiovascular events. Fewer cardiovascular events occurred in the exenatide group, thus showing cardiovascular safety; however, exenatide failed to show a significant cardiovascular benefit, with the overall results not significantly different from the placebo group. No significant differences were identified in severe hypoglycaemia, pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer or medullary thyroid cancer between treatment and placebo.

ELIXA

The ELIXA trial included subjects randomised to receive lixisenatide (starting dose 10 mcg for 2 weeks, maximum dose 20 mcg) or placebo who were followed for a median of 25 months. The outcome of this study was the time to first MACE using a composite of 4 cardiovascular outcomes, and the study was powered to detect both non-inferiority and superiority. ELIXA was the first randomised, double-blind, non-inferiority cardiovascular outcome trial of a GLP-1RA to be reported. Only patients with previous acute coronary events were included in the trial. The results indicated similar rates of the primary composite outcome in both groups and no significant differences between the groups when components of the primary outcome were assessed independently. Moreover, there were no significant differences between the groups regarding hospitalisations for heart failure; this pattern persisted when analysed with the inclusion of hospitalisations for coronary revascularisation. Lixisenatide was not associated with an increased rate of serious adverse events or severe hypoglycaemia and exhibited a modest benefit on weight control.

### Rationale and design of the EXenatide study of cardiovascular event lowering (EXSCEL) trial [^113ojsgQ]. American Heart Journal (2016). Low credibility.

Exenatide once-weekly is an extended release formulation of exenatide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, which can improve glycemic control, body weight, blood pressure, and lipid levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The EXenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL) will compare the impact of adding exenatide once-weekly to usual care with usual care alone on major cardiovascular outcomes. EXSCEL is an academically led, phase III/IV, double-blind, pragmatic placebo-controlled, global trial conducted in 35 countries aiming to enrol 14,000 patients with T2DM and a broad range of cardiovascular risk over approximately 5 years. Participants will be randomized (1:1) to receive exenatide once-weekly 2 mg or matching placebo by subcutaneous injections. The trial will continue until 1,360 confirmed primary composite cardiovascular end points, defined as cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke, have occurred. The primary efficacy hypothesis is that exenatide once-weekly is superior to usual care with respect to the primary composite cardiovascular end point. EXSCEL is powered to detect a 15% relative risk reduction in the exenatide once-weekly group, with 85% power and a 2-sided 5% alpha. The primary safety hypothesis is that exenatide once-weekly is noninferior to usual care with respect to the primary cardiovascular composite end point. Noninferiority will be concluded if the upper limit of the CI is < 1.30. EXSCEL will assess whether exenatide once-weekly can reduce cardiovascular events in patients with T2DM with a broad range of cardiovascular risk. It will also provide long-term safety information on exenatide once-weekly in people with T2DM. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01144338.

### Effect of once-weekly exenatide on clinical outcomes according to baseline risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: insights from the EXSCEL trial [^1124cL3s]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background In the EXSCEL (Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering), exenatide once-weekly resulted in a nonsignificant reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) and a nominal 14% reduction in all-cause mortality in 14 752 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2 DM) with and without cardiovascular disease. Whether patients at increased risk for events experienced a comparatively greater treatment benefit with exenatide is unknown. Methods and Results In the EXSCEL population, we created risk scores for MACEs and all-cause mortality using step-wise selection of baseline characteristics. A risk score was calculated for each patient, and a time-to-event model for each end point was developed including the risk score, treatment assignment, and risk-treatment interaction. Interaction P values evaluating for a differential treatment effect by baseline risk were reported. Over a median follow-up of 3.2 years (interquartile range, 2.2, 4.4), 1091 (7.4%) patients died and 1744 (11.8%) experienced a MACE. Independent predictors of MACEs and all-cause mortality included age, sex, comorbidities (eg, previous cardiovascular event), body mass index, blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. The all-cause mortality and MACE risk models had modest discrimination with optimism-corrected c-indices of 0.73 and 0.71, respectively. No interaction was observed between treatment effect and risk profile for either end point (both interactions, P > 0.1). Conclusions Baseline characteristics (eg, age, previous cardiovascular events) and routine laboratory values (eg, hemoglobin A1c, estimated glomerular filtration rate) provided modest prognostic value for mortality and MACEs in a broad population of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Exenatide's effects on mortality and MACEs were consistent across the spectrum of baseline risk. Clinical Trial Registration URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT 01144338.

### Updates on cardiovascular outcome trials in diabetes [^116LT8GU]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

EXSCEL adds information on glucose-lowering agents of the GLP-1 RA class to the already published ELIXA, LEADER and SUSTAIN-6 results. Once-weekly exenatide confirmed non-inferiority to placebo in regard of CV safety but was not seen as superior in regard of efficacy. This is comparable to lixisenatide in the ELIXA trial. Nevertheless once-weekly exenatide decreased all-cause mortality by 14%, a similar reduction as observed for liraglutide (15% risk reduction of all-cause death), even though, by formal reasons, due to the lack of significant impact on the primary composite endpoint, could not in a hierarchical statistical analysis be accepted as formally significant. No safety concerns were risen by any adverse events observed in the EXSCEL trial. A fifth GLP-1 RA, dulaglutide is currently tested for CV safety in the REWIND study, which is estimated to be completed in July 2018.

The ACE trial differed from the other presented CVOTs with regard to trial population. Pre-existing diabetes was an exclusion criterion and for inclusion participants required a history of CVD and impaired glucose tolerance. As this trial was conducted in China, trial population consisted to 97% of Han Chinese. It was shown, that acarbose was more effective in individuals consuming "Eastern" diets compared to "Western" diets. This might be a reason for the high number of prescriptions of acarbose in China, where it is the most common oral glucose-lowering medication. It is also prescribed as preventative medication for individuals with impaired glucose tolerance (summarized in). Designed as a CVOT with a three point MACE the ACE trial could not achieve enough events, resulting in an updated five point MACE (adding hospitalization for HF and UA) as primary outcome. The primary endpoint was not reduced comparing acarbose with placebo. Also most secondary outcomes did not show a difference between the two treatment groups. The number of participants which developed diabetes during the follow-up of the ACE study was reduced by 18% in the acarbose group compared to the placebo group. This risk reduction of incident diabetes in the high CV risk population supports the fact, that acarbose is frequently prescribed as prevention for individuals with impaired glucose tolerance. Anyhow, it is worthy of interest that postprandial hyperglycaemia was not significantly different between the two groups in the last 3 years of the study.

### Effect of once-weekly exenatide in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with and without heart failure and heart failure-related outcomes: insights from the EXSCEL trial [^115u4uLB]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Once-weekly exenatide (EQW) had a neutral effect on hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) in the EXSCEL study (Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering), with no differential treatment effect on major adverse cardiac events by baseline heart failure (HF) status. EQW's effects on secondary end points based on HHF status have not been reported. The objective was to explore the effects of EQW on secondary end points in patients with and without baseline HF and test the effects of EQW on recurrent HHF events.

Methods

The prespecified analysis of the randomized controlled EXSCEL trial, which enrolled patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with and without additional cardiovascular disease, analyzed EQW effects on all-cause death, each major adverse cardiac event component, first HHF, and repeat HHF, by baseline HF status (regardless of ejection fraction). A subgroup analysis of the population stratified by preserved or reduced baseline ejection fraction was performed.

Results

Of 14752 EXSCEL participants, 2389 (16.2%) had HF at baseline. Compared with those without HF at baseline, patients with preexisting HF were older, and more likely to be male and white, with a higher burden of other cardiovascular diseases. Overall, those assigned to EQW had a lower incidence of all-cause death (hazard ratio [HR], 0.86 [95% CI, 0.77–0.97]) and the composite outcome of all-cause death or HHF (HR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.80–0.99]). When stratified by presence or absence of baseline HF, there was no observed reduction in all-cause death with EQW with baseline HF (HR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.85–1.29]), while the risk of mortality was reduced with EQW in the no-HF group (HR, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.68–0.92]) with an interaction P value of 0.031. The reduction in all-cause death or HHF seen with EQW in patients without baseline HF (HR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.71–0.93]) was not seen in patients with baseline HF (HR, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.89–1.29]; interaction P = 0.015). First, plus recurrent, HHF was reduced in the exenatide group versus placebo (HR, 0.82 [95% CI, 0.68–0.99]; P = 0.038).

Conclusions

In EXSCEL, the use of EQW in patients with or without HF was well tolerated, but benefits of EQW on reduction in all-cause death and first hospitalization for HF were attenuated in patients with baseline HF.

### Effects of exenatide and open-label SGLT2 inhibitor treatment, given in parallel or sequentially, on mortality and cardiovascular and renal outcomes in type 2 diabetes: insights from the EXSCEL trial [^1177TqYB]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

The results in this analysis apply to a population with characteristics similar to the subpopulation in EXSCEL adding an SGLT2i as part of their usual glycemic care, as would be the case in a real-world analysis, and different from the populations typically found in a full randomized trial. More laboratory measurements were available here than are commonly found in registry data, allowing propensity matching based on these metrics and study visit. This approach avoids the time lag bias that can occur when comparing to participants initiating an anti-hyperglycemic medication that may be used as a different line of therapy. Additionally, matching at comparable study visits avoids immortal time bias; subjects must remain in the trial for the same amount of time to be included, regardless of SGLT2i use. Most participants in this analysis initiated EQW prior to an SGLT2i, in contrast to the GLP-1 RA + SGLT2i clinical trials performed to date. The propensity-matched cohorts also reflect regional patterns in SGLT2i use, with less history of CV disease but more albuminuria and a longer duration of diabetes than the overall EXSCEL trial population. Event rates were generally similar in these cohorts compared to the trial as a whole: 3.7 vs. 4.0 MACE per 100 participant-years, 2.0 vs. 2.3 ACM per 100 participant years, and 1.4 vs. 1.5 CV deaths per 100 participant-years in the EQW and placebo arms of EXSCEL, respectively. These similarities in event rates are reassuring, though further study is required to assess the applicability of these results beyond the analyzed cohorts.

### Estimating the risk of cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes: validation of the UKPDS outcomes model using TECOS and EXSCEL data [^11224htc]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

To evaluate United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study Outcomes Model version 2 (UKPDS-OM2) cardiovascular risk estimates for people with type 2 diabetes using TECOS and EXSCEL data.

Materials and Methods

We compared model-simulated and TECOS and EXSCEL observed event rates for the composite outcome of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke, each component, and all-cause mortality. Risk factors analysed were age, sex, race/ethnicity, height, diabetes duration, atrial fibrillation, albuminuria, and baseline plus annual measures of smoking, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, weight, systolic blood pressure, HbA 1c, heart rate, white cell count, haemoglobin, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Other factors were prior ischemic heart disease, heart failure, amputation, blindness, kidney failure, MI, stroke, and diabetic foot ulcer.

Results

Median follow-up was 3.0 and 3.2years for the 14671 TECOS and 14752 EXSCEL participants, respectively. The primary outcome occurred in TECOS for 839 (11.4%) and 851 (11.6%) sitagliptin and placebo group participants, respectively (hazard ratio [HR] 0.98, 95%CI 0.89–1.08), compared with UKPDS-OM2 simulated events of 776 (10.6%) and 778 (10.6%), respectively (relative risk 1.00). The primary outcome occurred in EXSCEL for 839 (11.4%) and 905 (12.2%) once-weekly exenatide and placebo group participants, respectively (HR 0.92, 95%CI 0.84–1.01), compared with UKPDS-OM2-simulated events of 579 (7.9%) and 593 (8.0%), respectively (relative risk 0.98).

Conclusions

UKPDS-OM2 accurately simulated relative risks between randomized groups in both trials. The proportion of participants with the primary outcome was accurately estimated in both TECOS arms but underestimated by around one-third in both EXSCEL arms.

### Sex differences in the complications, care and clinical outcomes of patients with type 2 diabetes in the exenatide study of cardiovascular event lowering (EXSCEL) [^112WN4VJ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Aim

To examine sex differences in the characteristics and outcomes in participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D), with or without cardiovascular disease (CVD), randomized to once-weekly exenatide (EQW) or placebo in the Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL).

Materials and Methods

Baseline characteristics were summarized and compared by sex. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used for clinical outcomes, including the primary composite outcome of cardiovascular (CV) death, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke (MACE3). Models including sex-by-treatment interaction were used to evaluate differences in effects of EQW.

Results

Overall, 5603 women and 9149 men were followed for a median of 3.2years. Women were younger (mean 61.4 vs. 62.2years, P < .001) and had a shorter duration of diabetes (mean 12.9 vs. 13.2years, P = 0.039) and less coronary artery disease (35.2% vs. 61.0%, P < .001) than men, but also a less favourable metabolic risk profile and lower use of cardioprotective medications. MACE3 occurred in 9.1% of women and 13.5% of men, corresponding to 2.82 versus 4.40 events/100 participant-years (adjusted hazard ratio 0.80, 95% CI: 0.70–0.93, P = 0.003). There was no difference in MACE3 with EQW compared with placebo, or evidence of heterogeneity of treatment effect by sex.

Conclusions

This analysis of a large population of individuals with T2D, with or without established CVD, identified between-sex differences in clinical characteristics and care. Despite having worse management of CV risk factors, women had significantly lower rates of important CV events not attributable to the effects of study treatment.

### Effects of exenatide and open-label SGLT2 inhibitor treatment, given in parallel or sequentially, on mortality and cardiovascular and renal outcomes in type 2 diabetes: insights from the EXSCEL trial [^115L2i1W]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

It is critical to consider the limitations of this analysis when interpreting the results. The posthoc nature of this analysis and the moderate sizes of the propensity-matched cohorts limit the statistical significance of our results; interpretation should focus on key, hypothesis-generating trends, and how they compare to existing knowledge in the field. While we carefully designed the propensity-matching procedure to balance patient characteristics, including metrics of disease state, medical history, laboratory measurements, and concomitant medications, we cannot exclude the possibility of bias due to unmeasured confounders. Median follow-up time after SGLT2i initiation was under 2 years, restricting insight on CV outcomes and renal disease progression to this time-scale, which is relatively short for accrual of hard renal outcomes in this population with preserved renal function. We performed multiple analyses in two different cohorts, increasing the likelihood of type 1 error. To confirm the robustness of our results to matching variability within the study population, we re-matched and re-estimating hazard ratios; while one estimate for hHF was high relative to the resulting distribution (and thus likely a type 1 error), the estimates for MACE, ACM, and CV death were consistent with the overall distributions.

In EXSCEL, exact dates of SGLT2i initiation and cessation were not known. As such, we used an "intent-to-treat"-like analysis, starting follow-up at the first known SGLT2i usage, as done previously. In these cohorts, some patients added SGLT2i to their treatment plan while still taking study drug (exenatide or placebo), while others discontinued study drug (but remained in the trial) prior to SGLT2i initiation. This mix of participants, some using EQW and SGLT2i in sequence and others in parallel, is reflective of individual treatment decisions in clinical practice. In only subjects with overlapping EQW and SGLT2i use, we saw a similar benefit on mortality as in the primary analysis, though not on MACE. However, the limited size and resolution of this dataset constrains our ability to draw conclusions about sequential vs. parallel use of these drugs.

Propensity matching

Of the 623 SGLT2i users in the EQW arm with all required covariates (Additional file 1: Figure S1), 572 were matched in the placebo comparison (92%), and 575 were matched in the EQW comparison (92%), with all covariates having an imbalance of less than 0.1 standardized difference in the accepted sets of cohorts Additional file 1: Figures S3A, B), and similar propensity score distributions between cohorts (Additional file 1: Figure S4). These cohorts (Table 1) were generally similar to the overall distribution of SGLT2i users in the EQW arm (Additional file 1: Table S2), though, importantly, different than the overall population of EXSCEL. 560 of the participants in the EQW+SGLT2i cohorts were identical between the two comparisons. Characteristics in the separately matched "placebo" and "EQW" comparator cohorts were generally similar, but subjects in the "EQW" cohort were older, had a longer duration of diabetes, and were less likely to be Hispanic (Additional file 1: Figure S3C), limiting validity of direct comparisons between these groups. Median follow-up time for ACM in the placebo comparison was 13.3 months (IQR 6.5–23.1) for the combination cohort and 14.2 months (IQR 4.5–27.0) for the placebo cohort. In the EQW comparison, median follow-up was 13.3 months (IQR 6.5–23.0) in the combination cohort and 15.1 months (IQR 6.0–26.7) in the exenatide cohort.

### Effects of once-weekly exenatide on cardiovascular outcomes in type 2 diabetes [^112hYdia]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

Background

The cardiovascular effects of adding once-weekly treatment with exenatide to usual care in patients with type 2 diabetes are unknown.

Methods

We randomly assigned patients with type 2 diabetes, with or without previous cardiovascular disease, to receive subcutaneous injections of extended-release exenatide at a dose of 2 mg or matching placebo once weekly. The primary composite outcome was the first occurrence of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. The coprimary hypotheses were that exenatide, administered once weekly, would be noninferior to placebo with respect to safety and superior to placebo with respect to efficacy.

Results

In all, 14,752 patients (of whom 10,782 [73.1%] had previous cardiovascular disease) were followed for a median of 3.2 years (interquartile range, 2.2 to 4.4). A primary composite outcome event occurred in 839 of 7356 patients (11.4%; 3.7 events per 100 person-years) in the exenatide group and in 905 of 7396 patients (12.2%; 4.0 events per 100 person-years) in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.83 to 1.00), with the intention-to-treat analysis indicating that exenatide, administered once weekly, was noninferior to placebo with respect to safety (P < 0.001 for noninferiority) but was not superior to placebo with respect to efficacy (P = 0.06 for superiority). The rates of death from cardiovascular causes, fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal or nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for heart failure, and hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome, and the incidence of acute pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer, medullary thyroid carcinoma, and serious adverse events did not differ significantly between the two groups.

Conclusions

Among patients with type 2 diabetes with or without previous cardiovascular disease, the incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events did not differ significantly between patients who received exenatide and those who received placebo.

14.5 EXSCEL Cardiovascular Outcomes Trial in Adult Patients with Type 2 Diabetes

EXSCEL was a multinational, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, parallel group pragmatic study that evaluated cardiovascular (CV) outcomes during treatment with BYDUREON (exenatide) for extended-release injectable suspension in adult patients with type 2 diabetes and any level of CV risk when added to the current usual care (NCT01144338).

A total of 14,752 adult patients were randomized 1:1 to either BYDUREON 2 mg given subcutaneously once weekly or placebo and followed as in routine clinical practice for a median of 38.7 months with a median treatment duration of 27.8 months.

Ninety six percent of the patients in both treatment groups completed the study in accordance with the protocol, and the vital status was known at the end of the study for 98.9% and 98.8% of the patients in the BYDUREON and placebo group, respectively. The mean age at study entry was 62 years (21 to 92 years with 8.5% of the patients ≥ 75 years). Approximately 62.0% of the patients were male, 75.8% were White, 9.8% were Asian, 6.0% were Black or African American, and 20.5% were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. The mean BMI was 32.7 kg/m2 and the mean duration of diabetes was 13.1 years. Approximately 49.3% had mild renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] ≥ 60 to ≤ 89 mL/min/1.73 m2) and 21.6% had moderate renal impairment (eGFR ≥ 30 to ≤ 59 mL/min/1.73 m2).

Methods

Population and SGLT2i usage

EXSCEL (NCT01144338) enrolled 14,752 patients in 35 countries between June 2010 and September 2015. The primary results, study design and baseline characteristics have been published. Briefly, inclusion criteria included a hemoglobin A1c (HbA 1c) of 6.5% to 10%, and any level of cardiovascular risk, targeting ~ 70% of participants with a previous cardiovascular event. Participants were excluded if they were < 18 years old, had type 1 diabetes, ≥ 2 episodes of severe hypoglycemia in the previous 12 months, an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2, or previous pancreatitis.

All EXSCEL participants were included in this analysis except for 786 placebo arm participants that took open-label SGLT2i. The 33 EXSCEL participants who never received study drug and a further 635 participants missing required covariates were excluded from propensity matching (Additional file 1: Figure S1).

Information on SGLT2i use was collected at each 6-monthly study visit. As precise dates for concomitant medication initiation and cessation were not itemized, we assumed SGLT2i initiation at the first study visit that recorded its use. SGLT2i exposure time was calculated as the interval from the first visit with known usage to the last study visit with SGLT2i use recorded, regardless of gaps or switching of SGLT2i type. No lower bound on exposure was imposed. We assumed no SGLT2i use when information was missing; SGLT2i usage data was not collected before May 2013, 6 months after the first market approval of an SGLT2i. Due to the limited size of the available data, subjects were eligible for inclusion in the EQW+SGLT2i cohorts whether they discontinued study drug before SGLT2i initiation or not.

Conclusions

This analysis provides the first insight, from a credible cohort with adjudicated CV events, into long-term cardiorenal outcomes in subjects using EQW and SGLT2i either in parallel or relatively close sequence. The results, supporting the hypothesis that this combination may provide additional benefit particularly on mortality, motivate additional, more comprehensive study of combination GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i in the future.

The EXenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL) was a randomized, placebo-controlled, global pragmatic clinical trial designed to assess the effect of subcutaneous once-weekly GLP-1 RA exenatide (EQW) 2 mg on cardiovascular outcomes in 14,752 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus and a range of cardiovascular risk. Potential participants were permitted to take up to three oral anti-hyperglycemic drugs, or insulin in combination with up to two oral anti-hyperglycemic agents, as part of usual care for their diabetes management. During the course of EXSCEL, three SGLT2i were approved and marketed.

This posthoc analysis of EXSCEL leveraged the pool of participants taking open label SGLT2i in addition to study drug to quantify the impact of this EQW+SGLT2i combination on cardiorenal outcomes, as compared with both: (1) treatment with neither EQW nor an SGLT2i, and (2) treatment with EQW but not an SGLT2i, on top of standard of care.

2.4 EXSCEL

EXSCEL was an event‐driven trial designed to test for both non‐inferiority and superiority as co‐primary objectives for the efficacy of exenatide (2 mg once‐weekly subcutaneous injection) to placebo for the primary composite CV outcome (MACE‐3). 29 EXSCEL was unique to all other GLP‐1 RA CVOTs in that it was pragmatic in design, and did not include the strict ancillary CV risk reduction optimization included in other trials. 29 Patients with any level of CV risk were enrolled if all other inclusion criteria were met. 12 EXSCEL was also unique to LEADER and SUSTAIN‐6 in that it was designed so that ~70% of enrolled patients had established CVD, whereas LEADER and SUSTAIN‐6 did not approximate the proportion of patients with established CVD in their study design. 12 EXCEL also differed in its definition of CV disease, which included coronary artery disease (CAD; history of MI, coronary revascularization or coronary angiography showing ≥ 1 stenosis of ≥ 50% in a major epicardial artery or branch vessel); ischaemic cerebrovascular disease (history of ischaemic stroke or history of carotid artery disease as documented by ≥ 50% stenosis [with or without symptoms of neuro deficit]); or atherosclerotic peripheral artery disease (PAD; documented by objective evidence such as amputation because of vascular disease, symptoms of intermittent claudication confirmed by an ankle‐brachial pressure index or toe‐brachial pressure index of < 0.9, or a history of percutaneous revascularization). 12

Sample size calculations were performed consistent with the superiority hypothesis. 12 EXSCEL was designed to have 85% power to detect a risk of a primary composite outcome event that was 15% lower with exenatide compared with placebo, at a two‐sided alpha of 0.05. 12 To test the above hypothesis, 1360 composite CV events were required from a projected patient population of 14 000. 29 It was assumed that the annual composite primary CV endpoint event rate would be 3.8%, the lost‐to‐follow up rate would be 1%, treatment discontinuation would be 5% and the accrual period would span 5‐6 years. 29 The planned number of events was anticipated to provide in excess of 90% power to assess the trial's primary safety objective of non‐inferiority. The non‐inferiority margin specified in EXSCEL (upper bound of 95% CI < 1.3) was consistent with the previously published ELIXA and LEADER CVOTs.

Summary and discussion of the GLP-1 RA CVOTs results

All the GLP-1 RA CVOTs had an identical composite 3-point MACE primary outcome, including CV death, non-fatal MI or stroke (Table 1). The only exception was the ELIXA trial, which included an additional component of UA (4-point MACE) (Table 1). Nonetheless, there were different results obtained across the different trials, with some CVOTs showing superiority in the treatment arm, whilst others only demonstrated non-inferiority (Table 4). Even in trials which showed a positive effect, the significance of each component of the MACE outcome varied (see Table 4). This raises the question of whether or not we can consider the cardioprotective effects of GLP-1 RA as a class effect. It could in fact be the case that differences between drugs of this pharmacological class could explain the conflicting results, namely the long/short-action of the different GLP-1 RA and their molecule structure.

* Statistically significant difference

Even though one cannot discard mere play of chance as the culprit, there are many other objective reasons for the differences observed. Besides drug tolerability and ease of administration, trial design and population can heavily influence the outcomes. As we describe, there are several important differences between the ways GLP-1 RA CVOTs were designed. For the REWIND and EXSCEL trials, the primary analysis aim was to show superiority, whereas for the others it was to show non-inferiority. Even for the non-inferiority trials, the upper limit of the 95% CI differed, with SUSTAIN-6 and PIONEER 6 using 1.8 rather than the more common 1.3 limit. Inclusion criteria also varied significantly, as we highlight above, as well as concomitant antidiabetic medication (Table 2).

### Exenatide (BYDUREON BCise) [^116ezXwo]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The primary endpoint in EXSCEL was the time to first confirmed Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE) from randomization. MACE was defined as occurrence of either a cardiovascular (CV)-related death, or a nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or a nonfatal stroke. All-cause mortality, CV-related death, and fatal or nonfatal MI or stroke, hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome, and hospitalization for heart failure were also assessed as secondary endpoints.

A Cox proportional hazards model was used to test for non-inferiority against the pre-specified risk margin of 1.3 for the hazard ratio of MACE and superiority on MACE if non-inferiority was demonstrated. Type-1 error was controlled across multiple tests using a hierarchical testing strategy.

MACE Results:

BYDUREON did not increase the risk of MACE in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.832, 1.004; P < 0.001 for non-inferiority; P = 0.06 for superiority). See results in Table 10 and Figure 2. The incidence of MACE in patients with and without established CV disease was 13.4% in the BYDUREON group versus 14.6% in the placebo group and 6.0% (BYDUREON) versus 5.9% (placebo), respectively. Five hundred and seven (507) patients (6.9%) died in the BYDUREON group versus 584 (7.9%) in the placebo group.

### Clinical application of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in cardiovascular disease: lessons from recent clinical cardiovascular outcomes trials [^113gAP62]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2018). Low credibility.

Fig. 1
Potential effects of GLP-1RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors in CV outcomes trials. Based on the results from recent CV outcomes trials with GLP-1RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors, in addition to some common favorable CV effects associated with both classes, different class-specific effects (GLP-1RAs: benefit for risk of atherosclerotic outcomes, SGLT2 inhibitors: benefit for risk of HF outcomes) largely contributed to the overall improvement of CV outcomes. CV cardiovascular, GLP - 1RA glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, SGLT 2 sodium-glucose cotransporter 2

We also considered differences in trial designs and results among the CV outcomes trials with GLP-1RAs (Table 1). To date, four trials have been completed, and two trials are ongoing. Among the four completed trials, two (LEADER and SUSTAIN-6) demonstrated significant risk reduction in MACE, and one (EXSCEL) demonstrated a numerically reduced risk of MACE. In SUSTAIN-6, semaglutide treatment reduced the risk of MACE by 26% in a short follow-up duration (median 2.1 years). In contrast, in the ELIXA trial (once-daily lixisenatide), neither an increase nor a decrease in MACE and the individual component CV events was observed during the follow-up duration (median 2.1 years). This may suggest the possibility that the short-acting nature of GLP-1 activation enhancement was insufficient to reduce the occurrence of CV events, beyond improved glycemic metabolism. Compared to the other trials investigating GLP-1RAs, the ELIXA trial included T2D patients with recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS), suggesting that perhaps their CV risk was too severe to demonstrate a simple decline in CV events via short-term pharmacological intervention. Furthermore, the patients in the trial had received higher rates of statin treatment (> 90%), and their levels of HbA 1c were lower (< 8.0%) than those of patients in the other trials. Such differences in trial designs and medical history of the patient populations may be a major determinant of the discrepancy in the results, although the exact reasons are currently unclear. In the more recent EXSCEL trial (once-weekly exenatide), all-cause mortality was statistically decreased by 14%, and CV death was numerically decreased by 12%. Such outcomes were also significantly reduced by liraglutide treatment in the LEADER trial, but were not significantly reduced in the SUSTAIN-6 trial. Focusing on the differences between the two trials, the LEADER trial included a higher rate (> 80%) of patients receiving secondary prevention of CV events, while the rate was 60% in the SUSTAIN-6 trial. Interestingly, among the CV outcomes trials with SGLT2 inhibitors, the EMPA REG OUTCOME trial, in which almost all patients had a history of CV events at baseline, showed marked reduction in all-cause mortality and CV death. On the other hand, the CANVAS program, in which one-third of patients had no prior history of CV events, demonstrated no significant risk reduction in such outcomes. We therefore speculate that the reduction in risk of all-cause mortality and CV death following pharmacological intervention depends, at least in part, on history of CV events at baseline. In the EXSCEL trial, > 70% of patients had a previous history of CV events, which was higher than in the SUSTAIN-6 and CANVAS trials. Moreover, a subgroup analysis revealed that exenatide treatment was numerically better at preventing MACE in patients with a previous history of CV events relative to those without, although there was no statistically significant interaction of the treatment effect across the subgroups. A similar trend was also demonstrated in a subgroup analysis of the CANVAS trial. Finally, the treatment effect of GLP-1RAs on the hospitalization for HF was consistently neutral across the trials. Thus, these results suggest that GLP-1RAs exhibit superior preventive effects on atherosclerotic CV events and can improve CV prognosis in T2D patients with a previous history of CV events (except ACS), and that such treatment effects could become apparent by, for example, comparing the results of CV outcomes trials with another class of incretin-based agents, namely dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors.

Results

Full population characteristics and drug use

During the course of EXSCEL, 645 EQW arm participants used an SGLT2i at some point, with the highest SGLT2i use in Western Europe and North America (Fig. 1 a). Compared with non-SGLT2i users, these participants were more likely to be male (68% vs 61%), white (84% vs. 75%), have less history of CV disease (62% vs. 74%) and heart failure (9.1% vs. 17%) at trial baseline, and have more history of albuminuria (23% vs. 16%) (Additional file 1: Table S2). This group also had higher HbA1c (8.3% vs. 8.1% (67 mmol/mol vs. 65 mmol/mol)) and eGFR (85 vs. 76 mL/min/1.73 m 2), and took more anti-hyperglycemic agents aside from GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i (1.7 vs. 1.3) than non-SGLT2i users in EXSCEL (Additional file 1: Table S2).

### Effects of exenatide and open-label SGLT2 inhibitor treatment, given in parallel or sequentially, on mortality and cardiovascular and renal outcomes in type 2 diabetes: insights from the EXSCEL trial [^114DShSN]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes through distinct mechanisms. However, evidence on clinical outcomes in patients treated with both GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i is lacking. We aim to provide insight into the effects of open-label SGLT2i use in parallel with or shortly after once-weekly GLP-1 RA exenatide (EQW) on cardiorenal outcomes.

Methods

In the EXSCEL cardiovascular outcomes trial EQW arm, SGLT2i drop-in occurred in 8.7% of participants. These EQW+SGLT2i users were propensity-matched to: (1) placebo-arm participants not taking SGLT2i (n = 572 per group); and to (2) EQW-arm participants not taking SGLT2i (n = 575), based on their last measured characteristics before SGLT2i initiation, and equivalent study visit in comparator groups. Time-to-first major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) and all-cause mortality (ACM) were compared using Cox regression analyses. eGFR slopes were quantified using mixed model repeated measurement analyses.

Results

In adjusted analyses, the risk for MACE with combination EQW+SGLT2i use was numerically lower compared with both placebo (adjusted hazard ratio 0.68, 95% CI 0.39–1.17) and EQW alone (0.85, 0.48–1.49). Risk of ACM was nominally significantly reduced compared with placebo (0.38, 0.16–0.90) and compared with EQW (0.41, 0.17–0.95). Combination EQW+SGLT2i use also nominally significantly improved estimated eGFR slope compared with placebo (+ 1.94, 95% CI 0.94–2.94 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year) and EQW alone (+ 2.38, 1.40–3.35 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year).

Conclusions

This post hoc analysis supports the hypothesis that combinatorial EQW and SGLT2i therapy may provide benefit on cardiovascular outcomes and mortality.

### Updates on cardiovascular outcome trials in diabetes [^117Sp6cU]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

In 2008 the Food and Drug Administration introduced a guidance for industry that requires the investigation of cardiovascular outcomes of glucose-lowering medications. Since then, an increasing number of cardiovascular outcome trials have been completed in diabetes patients with high cardiovascular risk for members of the SGLT-2 and DPP4 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonist classes. The trials confirmed cardiovascular safety for all tested anti-hyperglycaemic drugs and, in addition empagliflozin, semaglutide and liraglutide could even reduce cardiovascular risk. The present review summarizes the results of the DEVOTE, CANVAS, EXSCEL and ACE trials that tested cardiovascular safety of Insulin degludec, canagliflozin, once-weekly exenatide and acarbose and were published in 2017. We provide context on these results by comparing them with earlier trials of glucose-lowering drugs and give an outlook on what to expect in coming years.

### Clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and peripheral artery disease: results from the EXSCEL trial [^111qpUD5]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent trials have identified anti-diabetes mellitus agents that lower major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) rates, although some increase rates of lower-extremity amputation (LEA). Patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) have greater incidence of diabetes mellitus and risk for LEA, prompting this investigation of clinical outcomes in patients with diabetes mellitus and PAD in the EXSCEL trial (Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering).

Methods

EXSCEL evaluated the effects of once-weekly exenatide (a GLP-1 [glucagon-like peptide-1] receptor agonist) versus placebo on the rates of the primary composite MACE end point (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this post hoc analysis, we assessed the association of baseline PAD with rates of MACE, LEA, and the effects of exenatide versus placebo in patients with and without PAD.

Results

EXSCEL included 2800 patients with PAD (19% of the trial population). These individuals had higher unadjusted and adjusted rates of MACE compared with patients without PAD (13.6% versus 11.4%, respectively) as well as a higher adjusted hazard ratio (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.13 [95% CI, 1.00–1.27]; P = 0.047). Patients with PAD had higher all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 1.38 [95% CI, 1.20–1.60]; P < 0.001) and more frequent LEA (adjusted hazard ratio 5.48 [95% CI, 4.16–7.22]; P < 0.001). Patients treated with exenatide or placebo had similar rates of MACE and LEA, regardless of PAD status.

Conclusions

EXSCEL participants with PAD had higher rates of all-cause mortality and LEA compared with those without PAD. There were no differences in MACE or LEA rates with exenatide versus placebo. Clinical Trial Registration URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov. Unique identifier: NCT01144338.

### Effect of once-weekly exenatide on clinical outcomes according to baseline risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: insights from the EXSCEL trial [^115EhMWt]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Using the parameters of the predictive model, we created a hazard risk score for each patient. A new time‐to‐event model for each end point was developed including calculated risk score, treatment assignment, and their interaction. We report the P values of the interaction term. The adjusted hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval for treatment as a function of the risk score are presented. For the analysis, a continuous risk score was assigned to each patient. For presentation purposes, we organized the relationships by quintiles to visually demonstrate the relationships between risk scores and events.

### Changes in heart rate associated with exenatide once weekly: pooled analysis of clinical data in patients with type 2 diabetes [^117DGFNm]. Diabetes Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Results from the Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL; NCT01144338), a placebo-controlled phase 4 trial examining exenatide QW for effects on cardiovascular outcomes in 14,752 patients with T2DM, of whom more than 70% had prior cardiovascular disease, showed no increase in cardiovascular events compared to placebo. Assessment of the primary outcome of this study, the time to the first confirmed cardiovascular event in the primary composite cardiovascular end point (cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke), over a median follow-up of 3.2 years indicated that exenatide QW was noninferior to placebo for safety (P < 0.001) but not superior to placebo for efficacy (P = 0.06). An LS mean increase in heart rate of + 2.51 bpm was observed with exenatide QW versus placebo during the study period (P < 0.001).

A meta-analysis of the LEADER, SUSTAIN-6, ELIXA, and EXSCEL trials found that GLP-1RAs significantly reduced the risk of the composite end point of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke (P = 0.033), in addition to reducing cardiovascular mortality (P < 0.007) and all-cause mortality (P < 0.002). The effect of GLP-1RA therapy on cardiovascular outcomes will also be assessed in the Researching Cardiovascular Events With a Weekly Incretin in Diabetes (REWIND) trial (NCT01394952), which will compare the time to the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, or nonfatal stroke with dulaglutide versus placebo over an average follow-up of approximately 6.5 years. Results from this study are expected in 2018.

### Effects of exenatide and open-label SGLT2 inhibitor treatment, given in parallel or sequentially, on mortality and cardiovascular and renal outcomes in type 2 diabetes: insights from the EXSCEL trial [^115FrrsP]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Time-to-event analyses

Hazard ratios (HR) for time-to-first-event analyses in both sets of propensity-matched cohorts were calculated via Cox proportional hazards regression. Analyses were performed with treatment as the sole exploratory variable (unadjusted), and adjusted for: duration of diabetes, age, sex, history of CVD, prior heart failure, prior microalbuminuria, prior macroalbuminuria, eGFR, and HbA 1c, to provide a "doubly robust" estimator with lower risk of bias than would be obtained via propensity matching or adjustment alone. The number of adjustment covariates was constrained because of the limited size of the matched cohorts.

Follow-up time began at matching (SGLT2i initiation or equivalent study visit in controls), and continued until the end of trial follow-up, regardless of study drug or SGLT2i discontinuation. Participants with an event before matching were censored at time zero for analysis of that endpoint. For composite endpoints, censoring occurred at the last information on the earliest censored component. For the renal composites, renal dialysis or transplant events occurring within 30 days of the last eGFR measurement were included.

Only participants with at least two post-matching eGFR measurements were included in renal time-to-event analyses (Additional file 1: Table S3). Persistent 40% eGFR reduction was defined as two sequential post-matching eGFR measurements ≤ 60% of the last pre-match eGFR measurement, with eGFR values over 250 mL/min/1.73 m 2 excluded. eGFR was calculated centrally using the MDRD formula, based on local, site-reported serum creatinine measurements.

Endpoints were analyzed in both comparisons, but no direct comparisons were made between the two sets of matched cohorts. Owing to the posthoc nature of this analysis, all reported p-values are nominal and no multiple test corrections were performed. A p-value < 0.05 was considered nominally significant.

eGFR slope

eGFR slope vs. time was analyzed in both sets of propensity-matched cohorts using a mixed-model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis to estimate the overall treatment effect on eGFR slope. MDRD-based eGFR was the dependent variable, with time (scheduled visit window) and baseline eGFR as linear covariates, treatment arm and visit-by-treatment interaction as fixed effects, and patient as a random effect.

Software

Data was prepared in SAS 9.4, and all analyses were performed in R version 3.4.0.

### Effect of once-weekly exenatide on clinical outcomes according to baseline risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: insights from the EXSCEL trial [^112DGdUa]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

The EXSCEL (Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering) was an international pragmatic trial that included a broad population of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) both with and without known cardiovascular disease. 1, 2, 3 In EXSCEL, once‐weekly administration of the glucagon‐like peptide‐1 (GLP‐1) receptor agonist, exenatide, resulted in a nonsignificant 9% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs; P value for superiority = 0.061) and a nominal 14% reduction in all‐cause mortality (ACM; P = 0.016) versus placebo. Whereas these effects were consistent across prespecified subgroups in univariate analyses (including previous cardiovascular event status), it is unknown whether relative magnitude of treatment effect with exenatide depends on a patient's overall baseline risk profile. Such data could help clinicians better understand how to optimize use of this therapy to improve patients' clinical outcomes. We hypothesized that patients at increased risk for ACM and MACE would experience a comparatively greater relative treatment benefit with exenatide than those at lower risk. We were specifically interested in exploring whether the relative treatment benefit would be greater in the higher‐risk group, not merely an increased absolute effect size in a group with increased disease severity and higher event rates. This hypothesis was based on potential mechanisms of benefits from GLP‐1 receptor agonists related to anti‐inflammatory and cardioprotective effects 4 (eg, weight loss, blood pressure reduction, and lipid lowering), which could be more instrumental in those at greater risk for events, and that for a given relative risk reduction the highest absolute risk reduction is usually observed in those at highest baseline risk. Thus, we developed risk scores for clinical end points in EXSCEL based on baseline characteristics and evaluated whether there was a differential treatment effect with exenatide based on a patient's baseline risk.

### Effect of race on cardiometabolic responses to once-weekly exenatide: insights from the exenatide study of cardiovascular event lowering (EXSCEL) [^111WdG73]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

There was no evidence of any statistically significant difference in the effect of EQW on the primary MACE endpoint by racial group in EXSCEL. However, in the meta-analyses of LEADER, SUSTAIN-6, and EXSCEL (all involving long-acting analogues), there was a statistically significantly greater CVD benefit of GLP-1 RA therapy in Asians versus Whites (relative risks [95% CI] vs. placebo of 0.35 [0.09, 1.32] and 0.92 [0.73, 1.08], respectively, and 0.68 [0.53, 0.84] and 0.87 [0.81, 0.94], respectively). Given the wide confidence intervals and post hoc nature of these meta-analyses, this finding should be considered only hypothesis-generating. Aggregate data were utilized, but patient-level data could improve the power and consistency of analyses through better characterization of subgroups. In addition, some potentially confounding variables were not considered. For example, we incorporated smoking in our adjusted models since smoking rates are relatively high in Asian populations. Although smoking is an independent risk factor for CVD, and of relevance to treatments such as exenatide as nicotine increases blood glucose levels in a GLP-1-dependent manner, it was not considered in the meta-analysis.

Our post hoc analyses have limitations. Baseline differences between racial groups in background blood glucose-lowering therapies may have influenced EQW responses during the first 6 months of the study. However, we are not aware of any clinically important relevant interactions. Despite the request for usual care providers to delay therapeutic initial intensification, there may have been small racial differences in changes in lifestyle and pharmacotherapy post-randomization that influenced group-specific cardiometabolic responses leading up to the 6-month follow-up visit. The grouping of participants may have masked important racial and ethnic differences present within the broad regional assignments we used. In the case of Asian participants, who are from an area that covers more than half of the world's population, we were not able to distinguish between East and South Asians, who are known to have different CVD risks. The strengths of the study are its relatively large number of participants, even relative to previously published meta-analyses, and the incorporation of people with type 2 diabetes at a later stage of their disease compared with participants in Phase III studies from which currently available race-specific comparisons have been made.

### Updates on cardiovascular outcome trials in diabetes [^116DvDTp]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2017). Low credibility.

The major results of the completed CVOTs are summarized in the following sections, divided by CV outcomes: Primary MACE composite endpoint, all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), unstable angina (UA), CV death and heart failure (HF). Subsequently the safety endpoints renal events, pancreatitis, hypoglycaemic episodes and amputations will be reviewed (Table 4).

Primary MACE composite endpoint

The primary MACE of the recently completed studies comprised similar elements: CV death, MI and stroke. The ACE study additionally included UA and HF into the primary composite endpoint.

In the DEVOTE study, Insulin degludec was non-inferior to Insulin glargine. Primary MACE occurred in 8.5% of the degludec group vs. 9.3% of the glargine group (HR 0.91; 95% CI 0.78–1.06; p < 0.001 for non-inferiority). Participants of the CANVAS program had a reduced risk of cardiovascular events when using canagliflozin in comparison to placebo. 26.9 vs. 31.5 participants per 1000 patient-years had an event comprised in the primary MACE (HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.75–0.97; p < 0.001 for non-inferiority; p = 0.02 for superiority). In the EXSCEL study the primary composite outcome occurred in 839 of 7356 patients in the once-weekly exenatide group compared to 905 of 7396 patients in the placebo group (HR 0.91; 95% CI 0.83–1.00). Thus, once-weekly exenatide was non-inferior with respect to safety but not superior with respect to efficacy (p < 0.001 for non-inferiority; p = 0.06 for superiority). A total of 470 of 3272 (14.4%) participants of the acarbose group in the ACE trial had a primary outcome event compared to 479 of 3250 (14.7%) in the placebo group showing no reduction of CV risk (HR 0.98; 95% CI 0.86–1.11; p = 0.73).

### Effect of once-weekly exenatide on hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome or coronary revascularization in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^115ryY55]. American Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular (CV) outcome studies of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have shifted the paradigm of type 2 diabetes management given their benefits regarding a reduction in major adverse CV events. However, the relationship between GLP-1 RAs and coronary revascularization remains poorly understood. In this EXSCEL post-hoc analysis, we used univariate Cox proportional models and Kaplan Meier survival analysis to evaluate the effect of once-weekly exenatide (EQW) on a composite outcome of hospitalization for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or coronary revascularization. Similar models were utilized to evaluate the relationship between significant participant characteristics within the entire study population and the composite outcome. Of the 14,736 participants in EXSCEL with complete follow-up data, 1642 (11.1%) experienced an ACS or coronary revascularization event during a median follow-up of 3.3 years (interquartile range, 2.3–4.4). EQW had no effect on hospitalization for ACS or coronary revascularization (HR 1.00, 95% CI 0.91–1.10). Among EXSCEL participants, enrollment in Latin America (HR 0.51, 95% CI 0.43–0.60) and a history of peripheral artery disease (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70–0.90) were associated with a reduced risk for coronary revascularization, whereas enrollment in North America (HR 1.92, 95% CI 1.74–2.12), a history of CV disease (HR 3.24, 95% CI 2.78–3.78), and a previous myocardial infarction (HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.39–1.71) were associated with increased risk for study end points. EQW had no association with hospitalization for ACS or coronary revascularization. Participant enrollment location and CV disease burden may play a role in the variable CV efficacy of GLP-1 RAs that has been observed in trials thus far.

2.5 Harmony

The study of albiglutide (30‐50 mg once‐weekly subcutaneous injection) on CV outcomes was the second GLP‐1 RA CVOT designed to exclusively enrol patients with prior CVD. 13 Eligible patients were aged 40 years or older with an HbA1c of less than 7.0% (< 53 mmol/mol) and established CVD defined as CAD, cerebrovascular disease or PAD. 13 CAD was defined as a documented history of spontaneous MI, a documented CAD 50% or higher stenosis in one or more major epicardial coronary arteries, or a history of coronary revascularization. 13 Cerebrovascular disease was defined as a documented history of ischaemic stroke, carotid arterial disease with 50% or higher stenosis, or a carotid vascular procedure. 13 PAD was defined as intermittent claudication and an ankle‐brachial index of less than 0.9 in at least one ankle or a prior non‐traumatic amputation or peripheral vascular procedure caused by peripheral arterial ischaemia. 13 Definitions of CAD, cerebrovascular disease and PAD were similar to EXSCEL.

Harmony was an event‐driven trial also requiring a minimum follow‐up of 1.5 years, and was designed to first test for the non‐inferiority of albiglutide to placebo by a margin of 1.3 with respect to its effect on adjudicated MACE, followed by superiority testing if the prespecified criterion was met. 13 It was determined that 611 events were needed for 90% power to rule out a non‐inferiority margin of 1.3 for the HR with a type I error of 0.05, assuming a true HR of 1.0. 13 A total of 9400 patients were planned for enrolment and followed until 611 events occurred. 13 Assuming the number of patients lost to follow‐up would be 1% or less, the mean follow‐up would be 3.2 and 2.2 years for an observed rate of MACE of 2% and 3%, respectively. 13

### Effect of once-weekly exenatide on clinical outcomes according to baseline risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: insights from the EXSCEL trial [^112fvhe2]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Results

Over a median follow‐up period of 3.2 years (2.2–4.4), 1091 (7.4%) patients died and 1744 (11.8%) experienced MACEs (including 723 [4.9%] with cardiovascular death). Table 1 presents baseline characteristics for those who died during follow‐up versus those who did not. Baseline characteristics by whether patients experienced a MACE event are presented in Table S1. Overall, patients with clinical events tended to be older, were more often men, had a longer duration of diabetes mellitus, had more previous cardiovascular events, and had worse baseline renal function compared with those without clinical events.

Tables 2 and 3 present the association between baseline characteristics and the end points of ACM and MACE, respectively, on uni‐ and multivariate analyses. Censoring and follow‐up time for MACE and ACM end points were similar by treatment assignment (Table S2). Importantly, the trial did not discontinue follow‐up after an initial clinical event, reducing the likelihood of informative censoring. Independent predictors of both ACM and MACE included age, sex, smoking history, region of enrollment, and cardiovascular and noncardiovascular comorbidities, body mass index, diastolic blood pressure, HbA1c, and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Baseline variables independently associated with outcomes are summarized in Figure 1. Of note, previous revascularization was associated with reduced mortality risk, but increased risk for MACE. Furthermore, systolic blood pressure during baseline evaluation was observed to be an independent predictor of long‐term MACEs, whereas a physician‐documented history of hypertension was associated with increased risk for ACM. ACM and MACE risk models had modest discrimination with optimism corrected c‐indices of 0.73 and 0.71, respectively. Figure 2 presents the calibration plots for the predictive models over a 4‐year period. The ACM model was well calibrated; the predicted probability matched what was observed in the population. The MACE model was not as well calibrated because it overestimated observed risk, particularly in the higher‐risk subgroup.

Time-to-event analyses

Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios for MACE, ACM, CV death, and serious hypoglycemia in each of the two sets of cohorts. In both comparisons, the hazard ratio for MACE with EQW+SGLT2i was non-significantly decreased compared with placebo (adjusted HR (95% CI) 0.68 (0.39–1.17)), and compared with EQW (0.85 (0.48–1.49), Fig. 2). This reduction was driven by a nominally significant decrease in risk of CV death (aHR 0.17 (0.04–0.77) compared with placebo and 0.21 (0.05–0.93) compared with EQW); nonfatal MI and nonfatal stroke were unchanged (Additional file 1: Tables S3 and S4). All-cause mortality was also reduced (aHR vs. placebo of 0.38 (0.16–0.90) and vs. EQW of 0.41 (0.17–0.95)), with no increase in risk of serious hypoglycemia (Fig. 2). Kaplan–Meier curves are shown in Additional file 1: Figures S5–S9.

Additional details are found in Additional file 1: Tables S3, S4, and Kaplan–Meier curves in Additional file 1: Figures S5–S9. Hazard ratio adjusted for age, duration of diabetes, prior cardiovascular disease, heart failure, sex, microalbuminuria, macroalbuminuria, eGFR, and HbA1c, all evaluated at first known SGLT2i usage or equivalent visit in comparator groups. MACE: major adverse cardiovascular events; CV: cardiovascular; pt-yrs: participant-years

In the exploratory analysis, the composite of hHF and CV death was nominally significantly reduced in both comparisons (Additional file 1: Tables S3 and S4), driven by CV death, while hHF was not reduced. Event numbers were small for both renal composites, with non-significant reductions in the estimated hazard ratios (Additional file 1: Tables S3 and S4). Amputations were rare (5 events total) and not significantly different in either comparison (Additional file 1: Tables S3 and S4).

### Effect of race on cardiometabolic responses to once-weekly exenatide: insights from the exenatide study of cardiovascular event lowering (EXSCEL) [^117WEc31]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Study participants and design

EXSCEL was a double-blind, placebo-controlled cardiovascular outcome trial that randomized 14,752 patients with type 2 diabetes, with or without previous cardiovascular disease, to the addition of EQW or placebo to usual care. It showed that EQW was noninferior to placebo when added to usual care for type 2 diabetes with respect to the primary 3-point MACE composite endpoint. Adults aged ≥ 18 years with type 2 diabetes were eligible if their usual care HbA 1c was 6.5–10.0% (48 to 86 mmol/mol) inclusive. The EXSCEL protocol specified that ~ 70% of enrolled patients should have previous cardiovascular disease. The trial was run jointly by the Duke Clinical Research Institute and the University of Oxford Diabetes Trials Unit in an academically independent collaboration with the sponsor, Amylin Pharmaceuticals (a wholly owned subsidiary of AstraZeneca).

Participants could be enrolled if treated with a maximum of three oral blood glucose-lowering drugs, or insulin alone or in combination with up to two oral blood glucose-lowering drugs. As part of baseline assessment, participants were asked to self-identify their racial background as Indian (American) or Alaska Native, Asian, Black, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, White, Hispanic, or Other.

EXSCEL participants were allocated at random in a 1:1 ratio to receive subcutaneous EQW (Bydureon) 2 mg or matching placebo. Other diabetes therapy (addition or substitution of any blood glucose-lowering therapies, including insulin, but excluding GLP-1 RAs) was adjusted by usual care providers according to local management guidelines. Usual care providers were asked to avoid such changes soon after randomization while HbA 1c levels were reflecting the initial effect of allocated study medication. Treatment of non-glycemic cardiovascular risk factors was also left to usual care providers with no post-randomization limitations.

In this post hoc analysis, we aimed to determine whether patients who self-identified as Asian had greater initial reductions in HbA 1c and blood pressure, pulse rate, and/or improvements in serum lipid profiles, compared with other racial groups in EXSCEL. CVD risk factors were first reassessed 6 months after baseline when the mean HbA 1c difference between the active and placebo groups was maximal because of the initial requirement to keep non-trial blood glucose-lowering therapies stable during this period. This was also the case for other CVD risk factors, reflecting the small number of participants in whom adjustments in cardiovascular therapy were made during this period.

### Glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists and cardiometabolic protection: historical development and future challenges [^111rxwUD]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

In CVD outcomes trials (CVOTs) such as LEADER, SUSTAIN-6, Harmony Outcomes, AMPLITUDE-O and REWIND, GLP-1RAs — including liraglutide, semaglutide, albiglutide, efpeglenatide and dulaglutide — significantly reduced the incidence of three-point major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). While these studies collectively support the use of GLP-1RAs for the treatment of T2D in patients at risk for CVD, discrepancies remain regarding the reduction of specific components of MACE, possibly due to differences in study design, treatment duration, and inclusion criteria. This highlights the importance of designing future trials with well-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria, particularly to account for variations in comorbidities such as hypertension, coronary artery disease, and heart failure (HF). Such criteria will improve stratification and allow more precise tailoring of therapies. In contrast, trials such as ELIXA, EXSCEL, and FREEDOM, which evaluated lixisenatide and exenatide in patients with T2D and CVD, reported neutral results for three-point MACE.

Most of the data on cardiovascular outcomes associated with GLP-1RAs come from studies conducted in overweight or obese patients with T2D. These findings have stimulated further investigation into whether higher doses of GLP-1RAs could achieve greater weight loss in individuals with obesity, even in the absence of T2D. Expanding these investigations to include more diverse populations, particularly those underrepresented in earlier trials, is essential to improve the generalizability of the findings and to ensure that the benefits of GLP-1RAs extend equitably across all patient populations.

### Cardiovascular outcomes trials with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists: a comparison of study designs, populations and results [^1145hvhu]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Two trials exclusively studied patients with CVD, ELIXA and Harmony, with the latter exhibiting a CV benefit. 9, 13 The CV inclusion criteria for ELIXA were narrow requiring all patients to have had an ACS event (STEMI, non‐ST‐elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI] or unstable angina) within 180 days before screening, 9 thus these very high risk patients may have limited their modification risk potential and stifled CV benefit potential with lixisenatide treatment. The time‐to‐event analysis in ELIXA was the first occurrence of MACE‐4. 9 By contrast, Harmony's criteria for established CVD were much broader and tested the effect of albiglutide on the first occurrence of MACE‐3. 13 Of the trials that did not limit randomization to patients with established CVD (LEADER, SUSTAIN‐6, EXSCEL, REWIND and PIONEER 6), EXSCEL was the only trial not to define inclusion criteria for CV risk factors and it had the lowest age criteria for inclusion (≥ 18 years). 29

Regarding statistical considerations, EXSCEL and REWIND were unique to all other GLP‐1 RA CVOTs. In EXSCEL, non‐inferiority and superiority testing were co‐primary objectives. EXSCEL was well powered to test for superiority and designed to make adjustments to the two‐sided alpha significance level to account for two planned interim analyses. Hierarchical testing was prespecified for the primary composite outcome as well as for some secondary outcomes. REWIND was the only trial with superiority testing as the sole primary objective. Testing for non‐inferiority in REWIND was to be performed in the event dulaglutide failed to show superiority to placebo. Testing of superiority and non‐inferiority could be performed in any order as REWIND used the same population (all randomized patients) for both tests.

### Follow the LEADER-liraglutide effect and action in diabetes: evaluation of cardiovascular outcome results trial [^114eJ11r]. Diabetes Therapy (2016). Low credibility.

Influence and Impact: Follow the LEADER

The LEADER trial, which studied the effect of liraglutide on CVO has changed much more than the clinical usage of liraglutide. Reported recently, its results place LEADER in the same league as the DCCT (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial) (NCT00360815) and UKPDS trials. These studies have contributed immeasurably to modern diabetes care, and their impact cannot be understated. The results of ongoing trials such as EXSCEL (exenatide once weekly) and REWIND (dulaglutide) will also modify the way in which we view LEADER. The EXenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL) study (NCT01144338) will assess the impact of exenatide once weekly on major CV outcomes. EXSCEL is a double-blind, pragmatic placebo-controlled trial being conducted in 35 countries on 14,000 participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and a broad range of CV risk over approximately 5 years. The Researching Cardiovascular Events With a Weekly Incretin in Diabetes (REWIND) trial (NCT01394952), being carried out in 9600 participants over nearly 7 years, evaluates whether dulaglutide, administered by a once-weekly injection, can prevent the appearance of CV complications in people with type 2 diabetes. Both EXSCEL and REWIND results will be eagerly awaited, to see if the benefits obtained in LEADER are liraglutide specific or are a class effect of long-acting and intermediate-acting GLP1-RA.

Liraglutide has shown robust benefits, which extend beyond its glucose-lowering effect. Currently, it is the only glucose-lowering drug which is approved for use as an anti-obesity treatment in euglycemic persons as well. LEADER adds to this spectrum of use by encouraging its use in persons with diabetes at high risk of CV disease, and high risk of renal disease. The drug has been shown to have both macro- and micro-vascular benefits, and this allows its use as a pan-vascular preventive molecule apart from being a glucose-lowering treatment. LEADER data suggest that liraglutide can be used for secondary prevention (prevention of MI and stroke), and strongly supports its use for tertiary prevention (prevention of fatality after occurrence of MI or stroke). Long-term studies are still required to assess its utility in primary prevention, i.e. prevention of CV events and death in persons without diabetes or other lower risk populations.

### Exenatide (BYDUREON BCise) [^1126BYnX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14.1 Overview of Clinical Studies

BYDUREON BCISE has been studied in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus as monotherapy and in combination with metformin, a sulfonylurea, a thiazolidinedione, a combination of metformin and a sulfonylurea, or a combination of metformin and a thiazolidinedione [see Clinical Studies (14.2)].

The effectiveness of BYDUREON BCISE as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus was also supported by adequate and well-controlled studies of BYDUREON, another extended-release exenatide product, in adult and pediatric patients aged 10 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus [see Clinical Studies (14.3, 14.4, 14.6)].

Cardiovascular (CV) outcomes were studied in the EXSCEL trial that enrolled adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and multiple risk factors for CV disease or established CV disease [see Clinical Studies (14.5)].

### The effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on renal outcomes in type 2 diabetes [^113jsBLH]. Diabetes Therapy (2020). Medium credibility.

Exenatide

The EXSCEL trial is the largest CVOT of a GLP-1RA, assessing cardiovascular safety of once-weekly exenatide compared with placebo on the background of usual care in 14,752 patients with T2DM (73.1% had previous CVD). Renal outcomes in the EXSCEL trial were changes in eGFR, occurrence of new macroalbuminuria and two renal composites (renal composite 1: 40% decline in eGFR, RRT, renal death and renal composite 2: 40% decline in eGFR, RRT, renal death and new macroalbuminuria) from a prespecified analysis plan. Intention-to-treat analyses showed no significant difference in eGFR levels and development of new macroalbuminuria but a 15% lower renal composite 2 adjusted risk with exenatide (p = 0.027).

Albiglutide

The Harmony Outcomes trial was designed to assess cardiovascular safety of once-weekly albiglutide compared with a placebo in patients with T2DM and CVD. The trial included 9463 patients with a median follow-up of 1.5 years. No differences in the rate of eGFR decline and renal events were noted between the two groups.

### Assessment of cardiovascular risk with glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists in patients with type 2 diabetes using an alternative measure to the hazard ratio [^114X7LKn]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Randomized clinical trials with the aim of evaluating the cardiovascular risks associated with glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, lixisenatide, liraglutide, semaglutide, and exenatide, have been conducted. They showed different results among the agents, but the reason has not been explained.

Objective

To evaluate the cardiovascular risks associated with GLP-1 receptor agonists by using an alternative measure to the hazard ratio.

Methods

We used the difference in restricted mean survival time (RMST) as a measure of cardiovascular risks. Four randomized clinical trials with cardiovascular events as a primary endpoint, ELIXA (lixisenatide), LEADER (liraglutide), SUSTAIN-6 (semaglutide), and EXSCEL (exenatide), were reevaluated by estimating the RMSTs for each of the agents and placebo based on the reconstructed individual patient data for each time-to-event outcome from publicly available information.

Results

The differences of RMSTs (GLP-1 receptor agonist minus placebo: point estimate and 95% CI) for primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular events were 0 days [-14, 14] in ELIXA (1080 days follow-up), 20 days [6, 34] in LEADER (1620 days follow-up), 8 days [1, 15] in SUSTAIN-6 (672 days follow-up), and 11 days [-3, 26] in EXSCEL (1825 days follow-up). As for the risk of other cardiovascular outcomes, there were no substantial differences between GLP-1 receptor agonists and placebo.

Conclusions

Liraglutide and semaglutide decrease the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events compared with placebo when using the difference in RMST. The previously reported result that GLP-1 receptor agonists do not increase the risk of cardiovascular outcomes compared with placebo is also confirmed.

### Cluster analysis of cardiovascular phenotypes in patients with type 2 diabetes and established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease: a potential approach to precision medicine [^1167Mr8X]. Diabetes Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

Phenotypic heterogeneity among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is ill defined. We used cluster analysis machine-learning algorithms to identify phenotypes among trial participants with T2DM and ASCVD.

Research Design and Methods

We used data from the Trial Evaluating Cardiovascular Outcomes with Sitagliptin (TECOS) study (n = 14,671), a cardiovascular outcome safety trial comparing sitagliptin with placebo in patients with T2DM and ASCVD (median follow-up 3.0 years). Cluster analysis using 40 baseline variables was conducted, with associations between clusters and the primary composite outcome (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or hospitalization for unstable angina) assessed by Cox proportional hazards models. We replicated the results using the Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL) trial.

Results

Four distinct phenotypes were identified: cluster I included Caucasian men with a high prevalence of coronary artery disease; cluster II included Asian patients with a low BMI; cluster III included women with noncoronary ASCVD disease; and cluster IV included patients with heart failure and kidney dysfunction. The primary outcome occurred, respectively, in 11.6%, 8.6%, 10.3%, and 16.8% of patients in clusters I to IV. The crude difference in cardiovascular risk for the highest versus lowest risk cluster (cluster IV vs. II) was statistically significant (hazard ratio 2.74 [95% CI 2.29–3.29]). Similar phenotypes and outcomes were identified in EXSCEL.

Conclusions

In patients with T2DM and ASCVD, cluster analysis identified four clinically distinct groups. Further cardiovascular phenotyping is warranted to inform patient care and optimize clinical trial designs.

Trial Data Supporting a Reduction inRisk With the Use of‐1in People With

Because T2D is associated with an increased risk of CVD, regulators recommended in 2008 that clinical trial programs for all new T2D therapies should demonstrate that the therapy will not result in an unacceptable increase in cardiovascular risk. Following this guidance, numerous trials were conducted in people with T2D to evaluate the effect of GLP‐1 RAs on cardiovascular outcomes (Table 2). These phase 3 clinical trials all included a large population, ranging from 3183 participants Peptide Innovation for Early Diabetes Treatment (PIONEER)‐6to 14 752 participants Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering Trial (EXSCEL). The median follow‐up times ranged from 15.9 months (PIONEER‐6)to 5.4 years Researching Cardiovascular Events With a Weekly Incretin in Diabetes (REWIND)(Table 2). In these trials, the GLP‐1 RAs under investigation were all shown to be noninferior to placebo for the primary composite cardiovascular end point, time to first major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE; which included cardiovascular death, along with other cardiovascular end points such as myocardial infarction, stroke, and hospitalization for unstable angina), confirming cardiovascular safety. Furthermore, of the long‐acting GLP‐1 RAs, Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results (LEADER), semaglutide (SUSTAIN‐6), albiglutide (Harmony Outcomes), dulaglutide (REWIND), and Effect of Efpeglenatide on Cardiovascular Outcomes (AMPLITUDE‐O)were all shown to be superior to placebo in reduction of the primary MACE end point (Table 2), suggesting significant prevention of CVD. These studies were included in a recent meta‐analysis, which found that GLP‐1 RAs reduced the risk of MACEs by 14%, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.80–0.93; P < 0.0001), all‐cause mortality by 12% (HR, 0.88 [95% CI, 0.82–0.94]; P = 0.0001), and hospital admission for heart failure by 11% (HR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.82–0.98]; P = 0.013). No significant heterogeneity was found between the effect of a GLP‐1 RA in the prevention of MACEs in patients at risk (without CVD) and those with CVD, or between trials when ranked low, intermediate, or high risk based on MACE rates in the placebo group. Overall, these studies demonstrate that GLP‐1 RAs have a significant favorable effect on cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2D. Once‐daily subcutaneous liraglutide and once‐weekly subcutaneous semaglutide and dulaglutide have been approved by the FDA for risk reduction of MACEs in adults with T2D and established CVD.

In accordance with FDA guidance, for SURPASS CVOT, the NI margin was determined from an estimate of the HR (GLP-1 RA versus placebo) relative to MACE risk using a Bayesian hierarchical meta-analytic model (see supplemental information) for patients with established ASCVD. This analysis combined aggregate data from all available CVOTs described in Table 1. Exclusion of the ELIXA CVOT was justified based on differences in the patient population from all other included trials and pharmacologic characteristics of lixisenatide compared with other GLP-1 RAs (see Fig. 1), as has also been done in published meta-analyses.

### Cardiovascular outcomes trials with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists: a comparison of study designs, populations and results [^112zEYNK]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

REWIND was designed to test the ability of dulaglutide to reduce the incidence of MACE‐3 in patients who were comparatively more reflective of the general population of people with T2D in the United States as defined in prior reports. 14, 18 In order to evaluate the generalizability of GLP‐1 RAs in the CVOTs, Boye et al. 18 published an article in 2019 including patients enrolled or eligible for inclusion in four CVOTs (LEADER, SUSTAIN‐6, EXSCEL and REWIND) and found that none of the enrolled populations in any of these trials perfectly matched the reference population in key baseline characteristics. The EXSCEL population most closely matched in terms of both mean age (62.7 vs. 60.5 years) and those with an eGFR of less than 60 mL/min/1.72m 2 (18.6% vs. 17.3%), while REWIND most closely matched in regard to HbA1c, sex distribution and proportion with a prior MI. 18 The study also estimated the proportions of individuals in the reference population that may have been enrolled in each GLP‐1 RA CVOT, based upon meeting the trial inclusion and exclusion criteria. 18 Based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, 42.6% of the reference population were eligible for enrolment in REWIND, 15.9% in EXSCEL, 13.0% in SUSTAIN‐6 and 12.9% in LEADER. 18 The design of REWIND led to a mean baseline HbA1c of 7.3% (56 mmol/mol) and only 31.5% of patients had established CVD. 14

Despite the lack of uniformity in trial design, the beneficial effects of some GLP‐1 RAs on CV outcomes have been achieved without a significant increase in the risk of severe hypoglycaemia, pancreatic adverse effects or thyroid cancer. 25 The results of completed GLP‐1 RA CVOTs have helped to inform decisions regarding treatment recommendations for patients with T2D and established CVD. Studies on the effectiveness and safety of GLP‐1 RAs in real‐world settings are necessary to fully understand the CV impact of these agents. As more effectiveness and safety studies are reported for GLP‐1 RAs, better insight regarding the sustained CV benefits of these agents will be gained.

### Cardiovascular outcomes with exenatide in type 2 diabetes according to ejection fraction: the EXSCEL trial [^111iw8Lb]. European Journal of Heart Failure (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists reduce major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and cardiovascular mortality in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, previous studies suggest the effects on heart failure outcomes vary according to left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). We aimed to evaluate the effects of exenatide on cardiovascular events according to LVEF in people with T2D.

Methods and Results

Post-hoc analysis of the Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL) trial evaluating the effects of once-weekly exenatide (EQW) versus placebo on cardiovascular outcomes according to baseline LVEF (< 40% or ≥ 40%). Outcomes were also evaluated according to New York Heart Association (NYHA) class and obesity. The main outcome was hospitalization for heart failure (HHF). A treatment-by-LVEF interaction was used. In EXSCEL (n = 14752), 4749 participants had LVEF available at baseline; 455 (10%) with LVEF < 40%, 4294 (90%) with LVEF ≥ 40%. LVEF modified the EQW effect on hHF: hazard ratio (HR) = 1.52 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.95–2.43) in participants with LVEF < 40% and HR = 0.74 (95% CI = 0.55–1.01) in those with LVEF ≥ 40% (p-interaction = 0.012). No significant treatment-by-LVEF interactions (p-interaction > 0.10) were observed for MACE, cardiovascular death or all-cause mortality. The risk of HHF was also modified by baseline NYHA class (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.65–1.27 for NYHA class I/II; HR 1.84, 95% CI 0.95–3.59 for NYHA class III/IV; p-interaction = 0.062), mostly driven by the LVEF < 40% subgroup. Obesity did not modify the effects of EQW on HHF.

Conclusions

The EQW effect on HHF was influenced by LVEF, with a potentially decreased risk in participants with LVEF ≥ 40% and increased risk in those with LVEF < 40%. The risk of HHF was particularly high in participants with LVEF < 40% and NYHA class III/IV. LVEF did not modify the effect of EQW on atherosclerotic outcomes.

### Effect of once-weekly exenatide on estimated glomerular filtration rate slope depends on baseline renal risk: a post hoc analysis of the EXSCEL trial [^114sVzX9]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

3.1 Effects ofonslope

The median (interquartile range) follow‐up for eGFR in participants with UACR measured at baseline was 3.3 (2.1, 4.3) years, and with an average of 6.8 eGFR measurements per participant. In EXSCEL participants with UACR measured at baseline, the mean (SE) eGFR decline was −0.87 (0.07) mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year in the placebo arm and −0.85 (0.07) mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year in the EQW arm, resulting in a neutral estimated EQW treatment effect on eGFR slope (0.02 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year [95% CI −0.18 to 0.22]; Supplementary Table S2). In the subgroup of participants with baseline UACR > 100 mg/g, the mean (SE) eGFR slope was −2.85 (0.20) mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year in the placebo group and −2.07 (0.20) mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year in the EQW group, leading to a between‐group difference of 0.79 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year (95% CI 0.24–1.34) in favour of EQW (Figure 1A). Among participants with baseline UACR > 200 mg/g, the mean (SE) eGFR slope was −3.73 (0.26) mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year in the placebo group and −2.43 (0.27) mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year in the EQW group, leading to a between‐group difference of 1.32 mL/min/1.73 m 2 /year (95% CI 0.57–2.06). In participant subgroups with baseline UACR values < 30 mg/g, or with a baseline UACR cut‐off > 30 mg/g, no EQW effect on eGFR slope was observed. The effect of EQW compared with placebo on eGFR slope was consistent regardless of baseline eGFR, cardiovascular disease history, renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibitor use, and systolic blood pressure, with a small difference observed in subgroups defined by baseline body mass index (Figure 2A).

### Diabetic kidney disease: update on clinical management and non-glycaemic effects of newer medications for type 2 diabetes [^112xd4Yj]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

The evaluation of Lixisenatide in Acute Myocardial Infarction (ELIXA) trial examined the effect of lixisenatide in those with type 2 diabetes who had an acute coronary event (acute myocardial infarction or admission for unstable angina) within the previous 180 days. In comparison to the other trials this was a neutral trial which illustrated that the addition of lixisenatide did not alter the rate of major cardiovascular events. However, there was a signal for potential renal benefit with a modest difference in the percentage of change in urine ACR in favour of lixisenatide over placebo (24% versus 34%, p = 0.004 increase in urine ACR at 24 months).

The Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL) trial randomly assigned patients with type 2 diabetes with or without previous cardiovascular disease to receive SC injections of extended-release exenatide (2 mg) or placebo on a once weekly basis. Similar to the other studies the outcome was a composite of major cardiovascular events. Again, this trial was neutral illustrating non-inferiority to placebo with respect to cardiovascular safety. The lack of cardiovascular benefit may be related to shorter median follow-up or lower baseline glycated haemoglobin level (8%) in comparison to that in the LEADER trial (8.7%).

Dulaglutide was studied in Dulaglutide and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes (REWIND) a multicentre RCT of the addition of a weekly injection of 1.5 mg dulaglutide to an existing glucose-lowering regimen in participants with type 2 diabetes with either pre-existing cardiovascular disease, or cardiovascular risk factors, versus placebo. This trial was also a cardiovascular outcome trial and it found that with a median follow-up of 5.4 years (longer than the previously mentioned trials) the primary composite outcome of major cardiovascular events was lower in those treated with dulaglutide 12% versus 13.4% (HR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79–0.99). However, this study had lower baseline rates of both cardiovascular disease and CKD at 31.5% and 22.2%, respectively.

### Three-year efficacy and safety of exenatide once weekly: a pooled analysis of three trials [^114Scj98]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2017). Low credibility.

Aims

To evaluate the 3-year efficacy and safety of exenatide once weekly (QW) for type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a large clinical population.

Methods

This post hoc analysis of three DURATION studies examined pooled efficacy and adverse events with exenatide QW from the 2.5- to 3-year completer populations; insulin glargine (glargine) was a reference (DURATION-3). Patients randomized to exenatide QW during the controlled study periods continued controlled treatment (DURATION-3) or single-arm treatment (DURATION-1; DURATION-2) with exenatide QW for the study duration.

Results

In the exenatide QW group (N = 329), reductions from baseline in HbA1c, fasting glucose, and body weight were maintained from weeks 4 to 156 (HbA1c: -1.1 ± 1.3%; fasting glucose: -1.7 ± 2.7mmol/L; body weight: -2.4 ± 5.6kg; P < 0.05). Glycemic efficacy with exenatide QW and glargine was similar (HbA1c reduction: -0.8 ± 1.0%; N = 158); body weight increased with glargine (+2.0 ± 4.9kg). Variable reductions in systolic blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol occurred with exenatide QW. At week 156, 48.3% and 30.7% of exenatide QW recipients achieved HbA1c goals of < 7.0% and ≤ 6.5%, respectively. No new safety or tolerability issues were identified.

Conclusions

Exenatide QW improved glycemic outcomes and was well tolerated in patients with T2D for up to 156weeks.

### Generalizability of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist cardiovascular outcome trials to the overall type 2 diabetes population in the United States [^11191ZRt]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

To examine the generalizability of results from glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) in the US type 2 diabetes (T2D) population.

Materials and Methods

Patients enrolled or eligible for inclusion in four CVOTs (EXSCEL, LEADER, REWIND, and SUSTAIN-6) were examined in reference to a retrospective clinical database weighted to match the age and sex distribution of the US adult T2D population. We descriptively compared key baseline characteristics of the populations enrolled in each trial to those of the reference population and estimated the proportions of individuals in the reference population represented by those in the trials for each characteristic. We also estimated the proportions of individuals in the reference population that might have been enrolled in each trial based upon meeting the trial inclusion and exclusion (I/E) criteria.

Results

No trial's enrolled population perfectly matched the reference population in key characteristics. The EXSCEL population most closely matched in mean age (62.7 vs. 60.5years) and percentage with estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 (18.6 vs. 17.3%), while REWIND most closely matched in HbA1c, sex distribution, and proportion with a prior myocardial infarction. Based on I/E criteria, 42.6% of the reference population were eligible for enrolment in REWIND, versus 15.9% in EXSCEL, 13.0% in SUSTAIN-6, and 12.9% in LEADER.

Conclusions

Although none of the trials are fully representative of the general population, among the four trials examined, results from baseline REWIND were found to be more generalizable to the US adult T2D population than those of other GLP-1 RA CVOTs.

### The GLP-1 analogs liraglutide and semaglutide reduce atherosclerosis in ApoEand LDLrMice by a Mechanism that includes inflammatory pathways [^116F7MnR]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2018). Low credibility.

The structural properties of GLP-1RAs may drive some of the differences in their clinical effect to reduce major adverse cardiac events. Exenatide, a short-acting GLP-1-RA has shown beneficial effects on systemic inflammation in clinical studies, both acutely and by chronic treatment, but whether those effects translate into CV RR remains to be demonstrated in a CV outcome trial. Lixisenatide, another short-acting GLP-1RA, did not provide evidence of CV RR in the ELIXA (The Evaluation of Lixisenatide in Acute Coronary Syndrome) trial. Differences in patient populations and trial duration could explain the differences in outcome, but the duration of action by these different GLP-1RAs might also be relevant for the CV RR. It is well documented that the actions of GLP-1RAs have a strict pharmacokinetic-to-pharmacodynamic relationship. Interestingly and in contrast to the clinical setting, lixisenatide given as an infusion to rodents affected the plaque progression and stability. In the EXCSEL (Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering) trial, the once weekly exenatide (Bydureon) did not show CV RR. However, there was a statistically significant difference on all-cause mortality, and all endpoints trended in the same direction as in the LEADER trial. It may be speculated that the lack of significant CV effect in the EXSCEL trial could be due to the high rate of treatment discontinuation and the patients' low adherence. Dulaglutide, another long-acting GLP-1RA, is currently undergoing a cardiovascular outcome trial (REWIND [Researching Cardiovascular Events With a Weekly Incretin in Diabetes]). Whether CV protection is a class effect for all long-acting GLP-1RAs will thus be further clarified when the REWIND trial is reported.

### Impact of changes in conventional risk factors induced by once-weekly GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide on cardiovascular outcomes: an EXSCEL post hoc analysis [^111bxope]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

The objective of this study was to examine the degree to which conventional cardiovascular (CV) risk factor changes induced by once-weekly exenatide (EQW) might explain the placebo-controlled differences in CV outcomes observed in the Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL).

Methods

We entered participant-level risk factor values over time into a validated type 2 diabetes-specific clinical outcomes model to estimate event rates, and compared simulated with observed relative risk changes in EXSCEL. We performed simulations for each participant to minimize uncertainty and to optimize confidence interval precision around risk point estimates. Six outcomes were examined: major adverse CV event (MACE), all-cause mortality (ACM), CV death, fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), fatal or nonfatal stroke, and hospitalization for heart failure (hHF). We also performed a mediation analysis using Cox regression models to evaluate potential key mediators for ACM.

Results

Model simulations explained only modest proportions of the observed relative risk reductions for MACE (29%), ACM (15%), CV death (18%), and stroke (29%), but greater proportions for hHF (67%) and MI (200%). Mediation analysis suggested that baseline-to-6 or 12-month changes in HbA 1c, blood pressure, heart rate, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and weight did not mediate the EQW effect on ACM.

Conclusions

These model simulations explain only a modest proportion of the impact of observed EQW-induced changes in conventional CV risk factors on EXSCEL outcomes, apart from hHF and MI. Up to 1-year changes in conventional risk factors did not mediate the observed ACM risk reduction.

### Effect of once-weekly exenatide on clinical outcomes according to baseline risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: insights from the EXSCEL trial [^1115H3Ck]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this large trial of patients with T2DM and a broad range of cardiovascular risk, we found that routinely available baseline characteristics, including demographics, smoking history, previous cardiovascular events, noncardiovascular comorbidities, and common laboratory values, provided modest prognostic value for ACM and MACE. In contrast to our hypothesis that patients at increased risk for clinical events would experience a comparatively greater treatment benefit with exenatide than those at lower risk, we found that the proportional effects of exenatide on ACM and MACE were consistent across the spectrum of baseline risk.

Given the nominal 14% reduction in ACM observed with exenatide, we were particularly interested in exploring whether higher‐risk patients benefited to a greater extent with this therapy. Our first step was to develop a risk model for mortality to better understand which patient characteristics were associated with increased mortality. Relatively few risk models for mortality have been developed for patients with T2DM, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 so we developed a new model within our study population. The candidate variable list was based on these previous studies, but also included additional comorbidity data.

Table S4 compares the EXSCEL mortality model with previous T2DM mortality models. In brief, aside from the single‐center model developed at the Cleveland Clinic (N = 33 067), 8 our model is based on the largest number of patients (> 14 700) to date. Moreover, the EXSCEL population included greater geographical representation compared with previous models that were developed exclusively in Italy, 6 Hong Kong, 7 the United Kingdom, 10 or the United States. 9 In addition, previous models also included medication data that are not intrinsic patient‐level variables. Nonetheless, the majority of the independent predictors identified by the EXSCEL model are supported by previous work. For instance, age and sex were independent predictors in most of the other models as were cardiovascular comorbidities (eg, heart failure). Clinical parameters, including body mass index as well as HbA1c and estimated glomerular filtration rate, have also been previously observed to be independent predictors of outcomes. If validated in future work, the EXSCEL model may provide clinicians with a useful tool for prognostication given that all of the variables are commonly available in routine practice. We did not perform additional internal validation of the model (ie, develop the model in half the cohort and validate in the other half), given that our primary intent was to explore the treatment effect across risk in the cohort rather than risk model development.

Statistical Analysis

We aimed to recruit 720 participants and continue their follow-up for at least 2 years to cover several combinations of published estimates of the primary outcome event rate in cohort studies (1.8%-7.4% per year)and an up to 4 times proportional increase in the absolute risk of the primary outcome with the use of antiplatelet therapy in observational studies. Throughout the recruitment period and during extended follow-up, unblinded trial statisticians supplied the independent data monitoring committee with analyses of the accumulating baseline and follow-up data at the same frequency and for the same purposes as described previously. Two statisticians (A.R. and S.L.) and the chief investigator (R. A.-S.S.) prepared an updated statistical analysis plan for the analysis of extended follow-up, which was approved by the RESTART Steering Committee before database lock. All group comparisons were made using the intention-to-treat populations. All group comparisons were made using the intention-to-treat populations.

We estimated survival in each treatment group using a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of time to first occurrence of a primary or secondary outcome event during all available follow-up after randomization, censored at death unrelated to an outcome event or last available follow-up. We quantified completeness of follow-up as the proportion of participants with a complete follow-up questionnaire at each planned interval after randomization and as the proportion of the planned duration of follow-up that was observed. After assessing the proportional hazards assumption graphically and including a treatment by log(time) interaction, we compared survival by allocated treatment using the log-rank test. The primary method of analysis was to construct an unadjusted Cox proportional hazards regression model and a second model adjusted for all 5 covariates included in the minimization algorithm to calculate the HRs. We used the Mann-Whitney test to compare group summaries of modified Rankin scale scores by randomized group. We performed sensitivity analyses by adding symptomatic stroke of uncertain subtype or deaths of undetermined cause to the primary outcome.

We performed prespecified exploratory subgroup analyses of the primary outcome with statistical tests of interaction to estimate heterogeneity of treatment effect between the prespecified subgroups: the 5 covariates used by the minimization algorithm, antithrombotic therapy before ICH, and history of atrial fibrillation. The unblinded trial statistician (A.R.) performed statistical analyses with SAS statistical software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc). A 2-sided P < .05 was considered to be statistically significant.

When the new time‐to‐event models for each end point were developed, including the calculated risk score, there was no evidence of an interaction between treatment and risk profile for either end point (interaction P ‐value of 0.20 for ACM and 0.79 for MACE). Figure 3 presents the treatment effect by risk score quintile for clinical end points. In terms of study drug adherence by risk profile, median duration of exposure to the trial regimen was 2.5 years (interquartile range, 1.4, 4.1) in the lowest‐risk mortality group (lowest quintile) versus 2.1 years (interquartile range, 1.0–3.2) in the highest‐risk mortality group (highest quintile). The percentage of patients on treatment at 1 year and at the end of follow‐up (Table S3) was similar across quintiles 1 to 3 and was lower in the highest‐risk quintiles (quintiles 4–5). For instance, the percentage of patients on treatment at 1 year and at the end of follow‐up was ≈80% and 60%, respectively, in quintiles 1 to 3 compared with 72% and 44% in the highest risk quintile (ie, quintile 5).

3.3 Stroke

Cumulative stroke rates were pooled from five studies (PIONEER 6, SUSTAIN‐6, EXCSEL, REWIND and Harmony Outcomes). At 48 months, time to stroke was delayed in patients treated with GLP‐1RAs (pooled ΔRMST 0.22 [95% CI 0.15‐0.33]; P < 0.001 [Figure 2A]).

3.4 Myocardial infarction

Data regarding myocardial infarction were pooled from four trials (Sustain‐6, REWIND, Harmony Outcomes, LEADER). At 48‐month follow‐up, we observed a small delay in the occurrence of myocardial infarction in patients treated with GLP‐1RAs (0.42 [95% CI −0.02, 0.85]; P = 0.06); however, we also observed substantial heterogeneity in our model (I 2 = 75%; P = 0.01 [Figure 2B]).

3.5 Cardiovascular mortality

Cardiovascular mortality was reported in six trials (Sustain 6, Harmony Outcomes, EXSCEL, LEADER, REWIND, Pioneer‐6). At 48‐month follow‐up, cardiovascular mortality was not significantly different in the two arms (pooled ΔRMST 0.163 [95% CI −0.112, 0.437]; P = 0.24 [Figure 3A]). This was corroborated by the sensitivity analysis. We observed moderate between‐study variation (I 2 = 59% at 24 months, P = 0.01; I² = 56% at 48 months, P = 0.04) for our pooled model.

### The incretin pathway as a therapeutic target in diabetic kidney disease: a clinical focus on GLP-1 receptor agonists [^114vet6T]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

The following cardiovascular safety trial EXSCEL (EXenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering) investigated 14,752 people with T2D, 73% of whom had previous CVD. The results of the renal analysis have not been reported yet, but were presented at the ADA 2018 78th Scientific Sessions. As was the case with LEADER and SUSTAIN-6, hard renal outcome was unaffected by exenatide once weekly versus placebo, as the renal composite of 40% eGFR decline, RRT, and renal death did not differ between treatment arms. When new-onset macroalbuminuria was added to the composite, exenatide once weekly reduced the composite by 15% (95% CI 2–26%; p = 0.03). However, when analyzed as an individual component, the reduction of 16% in new-onset macroalbuminuria did not reach significance (95% CI 0.67–1.04; p = 0.11). eGFR levels over time also did not differ significantly between exenatide once weekly and placebo.

The recently published safety trial Harmony Outcomes (albiglutide and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2D and CVD)only reported that albiglutide does not substantially change eGFR after 16 months. The other safety trials with GLP-1 receptor agonists FREEDOM [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01455896] and REWIND (Researching Cardiovascular Events With a Weekly Incretin in Diabetes) [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01394952], investigating, respectively, continuous subcutaneous delivery of exenatide and dulaglutide, have not yet reported a renal outcome analysis.

### Incretin based treatments and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes: systematic review and meta-analysis [^1167zck5]. BMJ (2017). Excellent credibility.

Data extraction

For randomised controlled trials, we collected information regarding study characteristics (such as author name, year of publication, study design, sample size, length of follow-up), intervention characteristics (such as baseline treatment, type, dose, and duration of study treatment); patients' characteristics (such as age, sex, duration of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, body mass index (BMI), baseline HbA 1c, fasting plasma glucose); and mortality outcomes (that is, number of deaths and patients included for analyses in each treatment group). If a published trial did not report the number of deaths, while the corresponding registry report from ClinicalTrials.gov reported mortality, we used outcome data from the registry report. In an extension phase of a trial, if the initial treatment assignment was switched, we collected the outcome data before that point. For trials with multiple follow-up points, data, or reports, we collected outcome data at the longest follow-up.

Data analysis and rating quality of evidence

We conducted a meta-analysis of all included trials using the reported deaths from treatment and control groups. Given the low event rates in many trials, we used Peto's method as the primary analysis to pool effect estimates across studies. We excluded studies in which no deaths occurred in either study arm.

We conducted sensitivity analyses to examine the impact of using alternative effect measures (odds ratio versus relative risk), pooling methods (Peto versus Mantel-Hanszel (M-H)), statistical models (fixed versus random effects), continuity correction of 0.5 for trials with no events when pooling with the M-H method (versus excluding such trials), and analysis of trials with two or more events (that is, excluding trials with no events or only one event).

### Changes in serum calcitonin concentrations, incidence of medullary thyroid carcinoma, and impact of routine calcitonin concentration monitoring in the EXenatide study of cardiovascular event lowering (EXSCEL) [^114j81Q6]. Diabetes Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Increases in serum calcitonin, a tumor marker for medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), have been associated with glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist use in some preclinical studies. We report calcitonin changes in exenatide-treated and placebo-administered participants and MTC incidence in the EXenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL) and consider the impact of within-trial calcitonin monitoring.

Research Design and Methods

EXSCEL participants were randomized 1:1 to once-weekly exenatide 2 mg or placebo. Serum calcitonin was measured at baseline (with trial medication discontinued if > 40 ng/L) and annually thereafter (with trial medication discontinued if ≥ 50 ng/L). Median calcitonin concentrations were calculated at each time point, and thyroid malignancies were collected prospectively. Data regarding follow-up after an elevated calcitonin were collected retrospectively.

Results

At baseline, 52 (30 exenatide and 22 placebo) participants had calcitonin > 40 ng/L, and during follow-up an additional 23 participants (15 exenatide and 8 placebo) had calcitonin ≥ 50 ng/L in the intention-to-treat population. Median calcitonin concentrations were similar between treatment groups at baseline with no increase over time. Confirmed MTC occurred in three participants (2 exenatide and 1 placebo), all of whom had significantly elevated baseline calcitonin values (413, 422, and 655 ng/L).

Conclusions

During a median 3.2 years' follow-up, no change in serum calcitonin was seen with exenatide therapy. The three confirmed cases of MTC all occurred in participants with markedly elevated baseline calcitonin levels, measured prior to trial medication administration. Regular calcitonin monitoring identified no additional cases of MTC, suggesting no benefit of routine calcitonin monitoring during exenatide treatment.

### Microvascular and cardiovascular outcomes according to renal function in patients treated with once-weekly exenatide: insights from the EXSCEL trial [^113FS8EK]. Diabetes Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the impact of once-weekly exenatide (EQW) on microvascular and cardiovascular (CV) outcomes by baseline renal function in the Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL).

Research Design and Methods

Least squares mean difference (LSMD) in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from baseline between the EQW and placebo groups was calculated for 13,844 participants. Cox regression models were used to estimate effects by group on incident macroalbuminuria, retinopathy, and major adverse CV events (MACE). Interval-censored time-to-event models estimated effects on renal composite 1 (40% eGFR decline, renal replacement, or renal death) and renal composite 2 (composite 1 variables plus macroalbuminuria).

Results

EQW did not change eGFR significantly (LSMD 0.21 mL/min/1.73 m 2 [95% CI -0.27 to 0.70]). Macroalbuminuria occurred in 2.2% of patients in the EQW group and in 2.5% of those in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.87 [95% CI 0.70–1.07]). Neither renal composite was reduced with EQW in unadjusted analyses, but renal composite 2 was reduced after adjustment (HR 0.85 [95% CI 0.74–0.98]). Retinopathy rates did not differ by treatment group or in the HbA 1c -lowering or prior retinopathy subgroups. CV outcomes in those with eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 did not differ by group. Those with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 had nominal risk reductions for MACE, all-cause mortality, and CV death, but interactions by renal function group were significant for only stroke (HR 0.74 [95% CI 0.58–0.93]; P for interaction = 0.035) and CV death (HR 1.08 [95% CI 0.85–1.38]; P for interaction = 0.031).

Conclusions

EQW had no impact on unadjusted retinopathy or renal outcomes. CV risk was modestly reduced only in those with eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2 in analyses unadjusted for multiplicity.

### Deferasirox (Exjade) [^117XwDUU]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Study 4 (TELESTO; NCT00940602) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial performed in 225 patients with MDS (Low/Int-1 risk) and transfusional iron overload of which 149 were treated with deferasirox and 76 received placebo. The observed hazard ratio of 0.64 (95% CI: 0.42, 0.96) suggests a positive impact of deferasirox on event-free survival (EFS, a composite endpoint defined as death, worsening cardiac function, hospitalization for congestive heart failure, liver function impairment, liver cirrhosis, or progression to acute myeloid leukemia, whichever occurred first).

Non-Transfusion Dependent Thalassemia

Study 5 (NCT00873041) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of treatment with Exjade for patients 10 years of age or older with NTDT syndromes and iron overload. Eligible patients had an LIC of at least 5 mg Fe/g dw measured by R2 MRI and a serum ferritin exceeding 300 mcg/L at screening (2 consecutive values at least 14 days apart from each other). A total of 166 patients were randomized, 55 to the Exjade 5 mg/kg/day dose group, 55 to the Exjade 10 mg/kg/day dose group, and 56 to placebo (28 to each matching placebo group). Doses could be increased after 6 months if the LIC exceeded 7 mg Fe/g dw and the LIC reduction from baseline was less than 15%. The patients enrolled included 89 males and 77 females. The underlying disease was beta-thalassemia intermedia in 95 (57%) patients, HbE beta-thalassemia in 49 (30%) patients, and alpha-thalassemia in 22 (13%) patients. There were 17 pediatric patients in the study. Caucasians comprised 57% of the study population and Asians comprised 42%. The median baseline LIC (range) for all patients was 12.1 (2.6–49.1) mg Fe/g dw. Follow-up was for 1 year. The primary efficacy endpoint of change in LIC from baseline to Week 52 was statistically significant in favor of both Exjade dose groups compared with placebo (p ≤ 0.001) (Table 5). Furthermore, a statistically significant dose effect of Exjade was observed in favor of the 10 mg/kg/day dose group (10 versus 5 mg/kg/day, p = 0.009). In a descriptive analysis, the target LIC (less than 5 mg Fe/g dw) was reached by 15 (27%) of 55 patients in the 10 mg/kg/day arm, 8 (15%) of 55 patients in the 5 mg/kg/day arm and 2 (4%) of 56 patients in the combined placebo groups.

The SUSTAIN-6 Trial (Once-Weekly Semaglutide)

The Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long-term Outcomes with Semaglutide in Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes (SUSTAIN-6) consisted of 3297 people living with T2DM, 83% with established cardiovascular disease, receiving once-weekly semaglutide (0.5 and 1.0 mg) or placebo. New or worsening nephropathy, defined as persistent macroalbuminuria, persistent doubling of the serum creatinine level, and a creatinine clearance of < 45 ml/min/1.73 m 2, or the need for continuous renal-replacement therapy, was observed less in participants treated with semaglutide (3.8%) than placebo (6.1%).

A recent post-hoc analysis of the SUSTAIN trials (SUSTAIN 1–5 and SUSTAIN 7) assessed the effects of semaglutide (0.5 and 1.0 mg) versus comparators (active treatments or placebo) on kidney function (eGFR), albuminuria status (UACR), and adverse kidney events in 8416 people living with T2DM. Semaglutide was associated with initial reductions in eGFR that plateaued and marked reductions in UACR when compared to active comparators.

The EXSCEL Trial (Once-Weekly Exenatide)

The Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL) was a multinational, placebo-controlled, randomized CVOT designed to assess the impact of once-weekly exenatide compared to placebo when added to usual care in people living with T2DM and risk of cardiovascular disease. In a recent post-hoc analysis, renal outcomes were measured, including new macroalbuminuria and two composite outcomes consisting of 40% decline in eGFR, renal replacement, and renal death, with or without new macroalbuminuria. Neither renal composite was reduced with exenatide in unadjusted analyses; however, the second renal composite containing macroalbuminuria was reduced after adjustment when compared to placebo (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74–0.98).

4 CARDIOVASCULAR SAFETY

Over recent decades, morbidity and mortality have improved for patients with T2DM because of improvements in research and treatment, greater emphasis on the achievement of strict glycaemic control and improvements in other cardiometabolic risk factors.

4.1 GLP‐1 RAs

GLP‐1 RAs have a number of direct and indirect benefits. These include moderate blood pressure lowering, changes in lipid profiles, and effects on cardiac output, ischaemic conditioning, inflammatory processes and endothelial function that may decrease cardiovascular risk. Since 2008, regulatory authorities have required that the cardiovascular safety of drugs in development for T2DM be studied, and the outcomes of the resultant CVOTs have been reviewed extensively. Individual CVOT outcomes with GLP‐1 RAs have been heterogeneous, possibly reflecting differences in study designs, treatment persistence and study populations.

Fully published GLP‐1 RA CVOTs include those for albiglutide (HARMONY Outcomes trial), dulaglutide (REWIND[Researching Cardiovascular Events with a Weekly Incretin in Diabetes]), exenatide once‐weekly (EXSCEL[EXenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering]), liraglutide (LEADER[Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of cardiovascular outcome Results]), lixisenatide (ELIXA[Evaluation of Lixisenatide in Acute Coronary Syndrome]), and semaglutide (SUSTAIN‐6[Trial to Evaluate Cardiovascular and Other Long‐term Outcomes with Semaglutide in Subjects with Type 2 Diabetes] and PIONEER 6[Trial Investigating the Safety of Oral Semaglutide in Subjects With Type 2 Diabetes]).

Results

Baseline patient characteristics by racial group

Table 1 summarizes the baseline characteristics of the 14,665 evaluable participants (excluding 5 patients with unspecified race and 82 who died before 6 months), categorized by self-identified race. Because of the small numbers in some groups, four race categories were used — White (N = 11,113; 75.8%), Asian (N = 1444, 9.8%), Black (N = 870; 5.9%), with American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Hispanic, and remaining racial groups amalgamated into an Other Race category (N = 1,38; 8.4%). Asian participants comprised the second largest group after White participants. Compared with the other racial groups, Asians tended to be younger, shorter, and to have a lower BMI. They were also more likely to be treated with a sulfonylurea/other insulin secretagogue or an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, and they were less likely to have a diagnosis of congestive cardiac failure, to be taking diuretics or ACE inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers. They had the lowest median systolic blood pressure along with Other Race, but the highest resting pulse rate. Their serum triglyceride concentrations were comparatively low, but their HbA 1c levels and other lipid parameters were similar to those in the other racial groups.

Aim

To provide evidence on the cardiovascular and renal safety of metformin in chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3 to 4.

Materials and Methods

This post hoc analysis compared participants with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 15 to 59mL/min/1.73m 2 in the Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL) and the Saxagliptin and Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (SAVOR-TIMI 53) trials taking metformin, with those not exposed to metformin during these trials, using a propensity-matching approach. Adjusted Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and all-cause mortality (ACM). Metformin effect on eGFR slope was calculated using a mixed-model repeated measures analysis, and the number of lactic acidosis events was tabulated.

Results

No strong trend for lower metformin doses with lower eGFR values was observed in either the EXSCEL or SAVOR-TIMI 53 trials. In the 1745 metformin-using participants matched to non-metformin users, metformin had neutral effects on MACE (hazard ratio [HR] 0.91, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76–1.08; P = 0.28) and ACM (HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.70–1.07; P = 0.18), with no interaction by CKD stage, or with use of exenatide or saxagliptin. An improvement in eGFR slope was observed with metformin in the CKD stage 3B cohort in SAVOR-TIMI 53, but not in other groups.

Conclusions

This analysis of participants with CKD stages 3 to 4 from two cardiovascular outcomes trials supports the cardiorenal safety of metformin, but does not suggest a consistent benefit on MACE, ACM, or eGFR slope across this population.

### Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with and without diabetes: a meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials [^1135BdQJ]. Clinical Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

We considered the studies to be eligible based on the following inclusion criteria: (1) randomized‐controlled trials; (2) studies assessed MACEs; (3) studies compared an experimental group receiving an agent belonging to GLP‐1 agonists irrespective of the dosing regimens and route of administration; (4) studies included patients with diabetes or other conditions such as overweight/obesity and heart failure; and (5) studies with a minimum trial duration of 52 weeks (1 year). Studies were excluded if (1) outcomes compared between groups were not among cardiovascular‐related outcomes; (2) conference abstracts and lab studies; (3) the comparator arm received any active treatment including insulin, oral hypoglycemic medications, and any other agent belonging to the group of GLP‐1 agonists that the intervention arm was not receiving; (4) post hoc analysis of randomized trials; and (5) studies on glucose‐dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP‐1 dual agonists.

The primary outcome of the present study was set as MACE at the latest available follow‐up. Other outcomes of interest included cardiovascular and all‐cause death, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke/transient ischemic attack, and hospitalization for heart failure.

2.2 Data Extraction and Quality Appraisal

The data required for quantitative synthesis were extracted from the text, figures, and tables of the included trials. General and specific data were extracted from each article into pre‐specified spreadsheets. The general characteristics included trial name, identification number, the details of the intervention provided to the experimental group, the comorbidity of the studied population, and the duration of the longest follow‐up. The data related to the outcomes included the sample size of the intervention and comparator groups and the event rates that occurred in each of the groups.

For quality appraisal, the randomized studies included in this meta‐analysis were subjected to thorough assessment using the revised version of the Cochrane risk‐of‐bias tool for quality appraisal of randomized trials (RoB 2). This tool assesses the potential risk of bias arising from five main domains comprising randomization, deviation from the planned intervention, missing outcome data, method of measuring the endpoints of interest, and selection of the reported outcomes. Each study was assigned an overall risk of bias based on the specified criteria by two of the reviewers (J.K. and A.H.). Any disagreement was resolved by discussion and consensus. Plots visualizing the risk of bias were constructed using the robvis online tool.

### Enrolment criteria for diabetes cardiovascular outcome trials do not inform on generalizability to clinical practice: the case of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists [^114ifCg4]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the generalizability of cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) on glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), we assessed what proportion of real-world patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) constitute true CVOT-like populations.

Materials and Methods

We applied inclusion/exclusion (I/E) criteria of each GLP-1RA CVOT to a cross-sectional database of 281380 T2D patients from Italian diabetes outpatient clinics. We calculated the proportion of patients eligible for each CVOT and compared their clinical characteristics with those of trial patients. In addition, we used a Bayesian network-based method to sample the greatest subsets of real-world patients yielding true CVOT-like populations.

Results

Between 98725 and 124164 T2D patients could be evaluated for CVOT eligibility. After excluding patients who were already on GLP-1RAs and applying I/E criteria, 35.8% of patients would be eligible for REWIND, 34.1% for PIONEER-6, 13.4% for EXSCEL, 10.1% for SUSTAIN-6, 9.5% for HARMONY and 9.4% for LEADER. Overall, 45.4% of patients could be eligible for at least one of the CVOTs. These patients, however, were extremely different to trial patients in most of the clinical characteristics, including demographics, concomitant medications and complications. The greatest CVOT-like subsets of real-world patients were 0.5% for SUSTAIN-6, 1.0% for EXSCEL, 1.2% for LEADER, 1.8% for PIONEER-6 and 7.9% for REWIND.

Conclusions

A very small proportion of real-world patients constitute true CVOT-like populations. These findings question whether any meaningful information can be drawn from applying trial enrolment criteria to real-world T2D patients.

### Effect of once-weekly exenatide on estimated glomerular filtration rate slope depends on baseline renal risk: a post hoc analysis of the EXSCEL trial [^113NCfEP]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

The effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) on renal outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes at high cardiovascular risk are modest or neutral. However, GLP-1RAs may confer clinical benefits in those at high risk of progressive renal function loss. We examined the effects of once-weekly exenatide (EQW) on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) slope and urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (UACR) as a function of baseline UACR in 3503 EXSCEL participants (23.7%) with eGFR data available and 2828 participants (19.2%) with UACR change data available. EQW improved eGFR slope assessed via mixed model repeated measures, compared with placebo, in participants with baseline UACR > 100mg/g (0.79mL/min/1.73m 2 /year [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.24–1.34]) and UACR > 200mg/g (1.32mL/min/1.73m 2 /year [95% CI 0.57–2.06]), but not at lower UACR thresholds. EQW reduced UACR, compared with placebo, assessed via analysis of covariance, consistently across subgroups with baseline UACR > 30mg/g (28.2% reduction), baseline UACR > 100mg (22.5% reduction) and baseline UACR > 200mg (34.5% reduction). This post hoc EXSCEL analysis suggests that EQW reduces UACR, with improvement in eGFR slope specifically in participants with elevated baseline UACR.

### Effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on cardiovascular and renal outcomes: a meta-analysis and meta-regression analysis [^114kJcKH]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Aim

To evaluate the cardiovascular and renal outcomes of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and the associations between these outcomes and HbA1c or weight reduction.

Materials and Methods

We searched PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CENTRAL databases for randomized, placebo-controlled trials of GLP-1 RAs reporting major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; a composite of cardiovascular mortality, stroke, and myocardial infarction) as the primary outcome. We conducted a meta-regression analysis of primary and secondary outcomes with HbA1c or weight reduction following a meta-analysis with a random-effects model for these outcomes.

Results

We extracted data of 60800 individuals from eight eligible studies (ELIXA, LEADER, SUSTAIN-6, EXSCEL, HARMONY, PIONEER 6, REWIND, and AMPLITUDE-O). GLP-1 RAs reduced MACE (hazard ratio [HR] 0.86; 95% CI: 0.80–0.93; P < .001) and secondary outcomes including the composite renal outcome (0.80; 0.73–0.87; P < .001). In meta-regression analysis, every 1% reduction in HbA1c was associated with 26% and 35% decreases in the logarithm of HR of MACE (P = 0.044; R 2 = 0.65) and the composite renal outcome (P = 0.040; R 2 = 0.85), respectively. On the contrary, weight reduction was not associated with any outcome, including MACE (P = 0.390).

Conclusions

The reduction in HbA1c, but not body weight, is associated with cardiovascular and renal outcomes. The magnitude of HbA1c reduction can be a surrogate for the cardiovascular and renal benefits of treatment with GLP-1 RAs.

### Effect of once-weekly exenatide on clinical outcomes according to baseline risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: insights from the EXSCEL trial [^115B2FCq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Limitations

These data should be considered in the context of several limitations. First, although the broad inclusion criteria and overall pragmatic design of EXSCEL support generalizability, these observations may not apply to those patients who would not have been included in the trial. For instance, patients with higher baseline HbA1c levels (> 10%) were not included in EXSCEL, whereas those at a young age (> 18 years) were included. In addition, the EXSCEL trial enrolled ≈70% of participants with known cardiovascular disease at baseline, and thus there may be less applicability to those with newly diagnosed T2DM. On the other hand, these risk models are the first, to our knowledge, that include broad international representation (North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia Pacific), a wide age range, and a broad range of background T2DM therapies (including sodium‐glucose cotransporter‐2 inhibitors and dipeptidyl peptidase‐4 inhibitors). Importantly, these risk models have not been externally validated in other data sets. Given the pragmatic nature of data capture in EXSCEL, there were certain baseline characteristics (eg, urine albumin‐to‐creatinine ratio) that were collected, as available, from routine care and for which missing data prevented use of a validated risk model such as the Gargano model. 4 However, given that the EXSCEL models include variables that are routinely available in clinical practice, these models may have more‐broad utility for prognostication. Notably, our candidate variable list did not include medications. We decided a priori to focus on intrinsic patient‐level characteristics and not include medications given significant regional variation in availability and use of background therapies and a desire to have broader applicability. In addition, the models had only modest discrimination, and whereas the ACM model was well calibrated, the MACE model was not. This is consistent with previous work in other disease states 14 where robust mortality models are more readily derived compared with clinical composite outcomes that tend to have less discriminatory and prognostic utility.

### Osteoprotegerin, osteopontin, and osteocalcin are associated with cardiovascular events in type 2 diabetes: insights from EXSCEL [^113MXYDZ]. Diabetes Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the association of four bone metabolism biomarkers (osteoprotegerin, osteopontin, sclerostin, and osteocalcin) with cardiovascular events in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

Research Design and Methods

The Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL) was a randomized clinical trial evaluating the cardiovascular (CV) safety and efficacy of once-weekly exenatide for patients with T2D. Candidate biomarker data were selected from proteomic profiling performed at baseline and 12 months after randomization samples by SomaScan assay in 5,473 trial participants. The primary composite outcome was the first occurrence of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke (major cardiovascular events [MACE]). Cox proportional hazards models controlling for confounders were used for time-to-event analyses to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CI for a 1 SD increase in the biomarker concentrations.

Results

The primary outcome occurred in 813 participants (14.9%). Higher levels of osteoprotegerin (HR 1.11; 95% CI 1.03–1.20; P = 0.0047) and osteopontin (HR 1.10; 95% CI 1.02–1.18; P = 0.0095) were associated with an increased risk of MACE. The addition of osteoprotegerin and osteopontin to a clinical predictive model containing traditional CV risk factors provided minimal incremental value for MACE prediction (C-index 0.629 vs. 0.638; likelihood ratio test P < 0.001). Osteocalcin and sclerostin were not associated with MACE. Osteocalcin had a nonlinear association with all-cause death and with CV death.

Conclusions

Higher levels of osteoprotegerin and osteopontin are associated with an increased risk of CV events in people with T2D, supporting the hypothesis that pathways involved in bone metabolism play a role in CV disease.

### Effect of race on cardiometabolic responses to once-weekly exenatide: insights from the exenatide study of cardiovascular event lowering (EXSCEL) [^116fGkq3]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

To determine whether there were racial differences in short-term cardiometabolic responses to once-weekly exenatide (EQW) in the Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL).

Methods

EXSCEL enrolled 14,752 patients with type 2 diabetes (hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c) 6.5–10.0% [48-86mmol/mol]) with or without cardiovascular disease who were randomized double-blind to EQW or placebo. Background glucose-lowering/other cardiovascular therapies were unaltered for 6months post-randomization unless clinically essential, facilitating comparison of EQW-associated effects in 14,665 evaluable participants self-identifying as White (n = 11,113), Asian (n = 1444), Black (n = 870), or Other Race (n = 1,238. Placebo-adjusted 6 month absolute changes in cardiometabolic variables were assessed using generalized linear models.

Results

Mean 6-month placebo-adjusted HbA 1c reductions were similar in the four groups (range 0.54–0.67% [5.9 to 7.3mmol/mol], P = 0.11 for race×treatment interaction), with no significant difference in Asians (reference) versus other groups after covariate adjustment (all P ≥ 0.10). Six-month placebo-adjusted mean changes in systolic (-1.8 to 0.0mmHg) and diastolic (0.2 to 1.2mmHg) blood pressure, serum LDL (- 0.06 to 0.02mmol/L) and HDL (0.00 to 0.01mmol/L) cholesterol, and serum triglycerides (-0.1 to 0.0mmol/L) were similar in the racial groups (P ≥ 0.19 for race×treatment interaction and all P ≥ 0.13 for comparisons of Asians with other races). Resting pulse rate increased more in Asians (4 beats/min) than in other groups (≤ 3 beats/min, P = 0.016 for race×treatment interaction and all P ≤ 0.050 for comparisons of Asians with other races).

Conclusions

Short-term cardiometabolic responses to EQW were similar in the main racial groups in EXSCEL, apart from a greater pulse rate increase in Asians.

### Generalizability of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist cardiovascular outcome trials to the overall type 2 diabetes population in the United States [^115hLbUQ]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Aim

To examine the generalizability of results from glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonist (GLP‐1 RA) cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) in the US type 2 diabetes (T2D) population.

Materials and methods

Patients enrolled or eligible for inclusion in four CVOTs (EXSCEL, LEADER, REWIND, and SUSTAIN‐6) were examined in reference to a retrospective clinical database weighted to match the age and sex distribution of the US adult T2D population. We descriptively compared key baseline characteristics of the populations enrolled in each trial to those of the reference population and estimated the proportions of individuals in the reference population represented by those in the trials for each characteristic. We also estimated the proportions of individuals in the reference population that might have been enrolled in each trial based upon meeting the trial inclusion and exclusion (I/E) criteria.

Results

No trial's enrolled population perfectly matched the reference population in key characteristics. The EXSCEL population most closely matched in mean age (62.7 vs. 60.5 years) and percentage with estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 (18.6 vs. 17.3%), while REWIND most closely matched in HbA1c, sex distribution, and proportion with a prior myocardial infarction. Based on I/E criteria, 42.6% of the reference population were eligible for enrolment in REWIND, versus 15.9% in EXSCEL, 13.0% in SUSTAIN‐6, and 12.9% in LEADER.

Conclusions

Although none of the trials are fully representative of the general population, among the four trials examined, results from baseline REWIND were found to be more generalizable to the US adult T2D population than those of other GLP‐1 RA CVOTs.

### Effect of race on cardiometabolic responses to once-weekly exenatide: insights from the exenatide study of cardiovascular event lowering (EXSCEL) [^11266VMT]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2022). Medium credibility.

Short-term cardiometabolic response to EQW

There were small reductions in use of individual classes of blood glucose-lowering medications and non-glycemic cardiovascular risk reducing therapies over the first 6 months of follow-up that were similar across the racial groups (see Table 2).

Table 2
Medication use of the trial participants at 6 months of follow-up categorized by racial group

The 6-month, placebo-adjusted, absolute mean HbA 1c change showed no statistically significant treatment effect differences between the four racial groups (P = 0.10, Table 3). Mean HbA 1c reductions ranged from 5.9 mmol/mol (0.5%) in the White group to 7.3 mmol/mol (0.8%) in the Other Race group. There were similarly no race-specific statistically significant differences in changes in systolic or diastolic blood pressure (P ≥ 0.47, Table 3). The 95% CI for the reduction in systolic blood pressure did not include zero for the White, Asian, and Other Race groups, indicating the presence of a treatment effect, but there was no placebo-adjusted reduction in Black participants. There was a consistent mean pulse rate increase of between 2 and 4 beats/min between baseline and 6 months in response to EQW across all racial groups, with the Asians having a significantly greater rise than the other three groups (interaction P = 0.016, Table 3). There were no significant EQW effects on serum LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, or serum triglycerides regardless of racial group. Mean reductions in serum LDL cholesterol and serum triglycerides were most pronounced in the White group with the respective 95% CIs not including zero.

Table 3
Placebo-adjusted mean (95% confidence interval) changes in cardiometabolic variables from baseline to 6 months by racial group (adjusted models)

There were similar findings in placebo-adjusted models without further adjustment for confounding variables (see Additional file 1: Table S1), and when absolute changes were analyzed by allocated treatment with and without adjustment for covariates (see Additional file 1: Tables S2 and S3).

### Cardiovascular risk reduction with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists is proportional to HbA1c lowering in type 2 diabetes: an updated meta-regression analysis incorporating FLOW and SOUL trials [^1146D4V6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

To evaluate relationships of cardiovascular and kidney outcomes with glycemic or bodyweight reductions in randomised placebo-controlled trials of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), incorporating data from FLOW and SOUL trials.

Materials and Methods

PubMed and EMBASE were searched up to 22 August 2025 for placebo-controlled randomized trials of oral or bolus-type, subcutaneous GLP-1RAs reporting major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) in adults with type 2 diabetes. The primary outcome was MACE; secondary outcomes included heart failure (HF) and kidney outcomes. Random-effects meta-analyses were followed by meta-regression evaluating associations with HbA1c and bodyweight reduction.

Results

A total of 73263 individuals were included from 10 trials (ELIXA, LEADER, SUSTAIN-6, EXSCEL, Harmony Outcomes, PIONEER 6, REWIND, AMPLITUDE-O, FLOW, and SOUL). GLP-1RAs reduced MACE by 14% (hazard ratio: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.82 to 0.91; p < 0.001), as well as hospitalisation for HF and the composite kidney outcome (both p < 0.001). Meta-regression showed that every 1% extra reduction in HbA1c corresponded to a 27% lower HR for MACE (p = 0.015; R 2 = 0.61). While HbA1c reduction was not significantly associated with secondary outcomes, the directionality was consistent with MACE. Bodyweight change was not associated with any of the analysed endpoints, including MACE (p = 0.13; R 2 = 0.21).

Conclusions

HbA1c reduction, not bodyweight change, was significantly and proportionally associated with MACE risk reduction. HbA1c lowering may serve as a useful surrogate for the cardiovascular improvements associated with GLP-1RAs in type 2 diabetes.

### Effects of exenatide once weekly plus dapagliflozin, exenatide once weekly, or dapagliflozin, added to metformin monotherapy, on body weight, systolic blood pressure, and triglycerides in patients with type 2 diabetes in the DURATION-8 study [^1133j5he]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2018). Low credibility.

Dapagliflozin has also been shown to improve cardiovascular risk factors in patients with increased cardiovascular risk. In a pooled analysis of 2 trials investigating initial combination therapy with dapagliflozin and metformin for 24 weeks, the proportion of patients achieving a composite endpoint of HbA1c < 53 mmol/mol (< 7.0%) and SBP/diastolic blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg increased as baseline BMI increased (< 25 kg/m 2, 21%; 25 to < 30 kg/m 2, 29%; ≥ 30 kg/m 2, 48%). 10 Consistent with the results reported in this analysis, a pooled analysis of 13 studies found that patients with T2DM and systolic hypertension (SBP ≥ 140 mm Hg) had a greater placebo‐subtracted decrease in SBP (−3.6 mm Hg) vs those without hypertension (−2.6 mm Hg) over 24 weeks of treatment. 11

While the present analysis focused on changes in cardiovascular risk factors with exenatide once weekly plus dapagliflozin in combination, several large‐scale randomized trials have investigated cardiovascular outcomes with GLP‐1RAs and SGLT2 inhibitors separately among patients with T2DM and high cardiovascular risk. Liraglutide and semaglutide each demonstrated a significantly lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events vs placebo in their respective cardiovascular outcomes trials. 12, 13 Recently, the Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL), which examined the cardiovascular effects of exenatide once‐weekly treatment vs usual care, found that exenatide once weekly did not increase cardiovascular risk, while also demonstrating a consistent safety profile 14; however, the recorded 9% decrease in cardiovascular events did not reach statistical significance.

Among the SGLT2 inhibitors, empagliflozin and canagliflozin have shown reduced risk of major adverse cardiovascular events vs placebo in their respective cardiovascular outcomes trials. 15, 16 The results of a large cardiovascular outcomes trial investigating the effects of dapagliflozin (Dapagliflozin Effect on Cardiovascular Events [DECLARE‐TIMI 58]) on cardiovascular events are also expected.

### Multi-year follow-up of abciximab therapy in three randomized, placebo-controlled trials of percutaneous coronary revascularization [^1145hQ8m]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

There is considerable evidence supporting the use of platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors to reduce ischemic complications of percutaneous coronary revascularization. However, long-term follow-up has been limited. In three large-scale randomized trials that tested abciximab at a uniform bolus dose and 12-hour infusion against placebo, in a double-blind fashion, a total of 5799 patients had their long-term follow-up vital status determined at a minimum of 7 years (EPIC), 4.5 years (EPILOG), or 3 years (EPISTENT) after randomization (median, 4.8 years). The prespecified primary endpoint was all-cause mortality by intention-to-treat analysis at 3 years in patients randomly assigned to a common intervention. Follow-up for 5603 of the 5799 patients was 96.6% complete at 3 years; 320 deaths had occurred by that time. After 3 years of follow-up, mortality was 6.4% in the placebo groups and 5.0% in the abciximab groups (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.63 to 0.98; P = 0.03). A similar reduction in mortality was observed on an intention-to-treat basis when all follow-up information was utilized after a median of 4.8 years of follow-up (n = 652 deaths): 12.6% in the placebo groups and 10.2% in the abciximab groups (HR = 0.82; 95% CI: 0.70 to 0.96; P = 0.01). Abciximab treatment reduced all-cause mortality by about 20% during long-term follow-up after percutaneous coronary intervention. The findings were similar in magnitude and consistent in direction for each of the three trials, and the absolute survival benefit appeared to increase over time. Brief intervention with this monoclonal antibody during percutaneous coronary revascularization is associated with significant improvement of long-term survival.

### External validation of the BRAVO diabetes model using the EXSCEL clinical trial data [^116fTWyH]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

We have developed the Building, Relating, Assessing, and Validating Outcomes (BRAVO) diabetes model, an individual-level, discrete-time microsimulation model specifically designed for type 2 diabetes (T2D) management. This study aims to validate the model's performance when populated exclusively with a fully de-identified dataset to ensure its applicability in secure settings.

Methods

Patient-level data from the Exenatide Study of Cardiovascular Event Lowering (EXSCEL) trial were fully de-identified by removing all identifiable information and masking numerical values (e.g., age, body mass index) within ranges to minimize the risk of re-identification. To populate the simulation, we imputed the masked numerical values using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). We applied the BRAVO model to the baseline data to predict 7-year study outcomes for the EXSCEL trial and assessed its discrimination power and calibration using C-statistics and Brier scores.

Results

The model demonstrated acceptable discrimination and calibration in predicting the first occurrence of non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, heart failure, revascularization, and all-cause mortality. Even with the fully deidentified data from the EXSCEL trial primarily presented in ranges rather than specific values, the BRAVO model exhibited robust prediction performance for diabetes complications and mortality.

Conclusions

This study demonstrates the feasibility of using the BRAVO model in settings where only fully de-identified patient-level data are available.

P value (2 sided) for rivaroxaban vs placebo is from the log-rank test, stratified by the time from a positive COVID-19 test to randomization (at 1–5 days and at 6–14 days), with treatment as the only covariate. HR indicates hazard ratio.

In the safety population, which excluded patients who never received study medication, the primary efficacy outcome, evaluated in a prespecified sensitivity analysis at day 35, occurred in 2.0% in the rivaroxaban group and 2.7% in the placebo group (HR, 0.75 [95% CI, 0.35–1.58]; P = 0.44; Figure 2). All-cause mortality (1 patient assigned to rivaroxaban and 1 assigned to placebo) and all-cause hospitalization events (1.8% in the rivaroxaban group versus 2.5% in the placebo group) were not significantly different.

With respect to the primary efficacy outcome, there were no significant interactions between subgroups and trial regimen. Specifically, there was no significant interaction (P interaction = 0.51) between randomization strata days 1 to 5 (HR, 1.37 [95% CI, 0.63–2.98]) and days 6 to 14 (HR, 0.89 [95% CI, 0.32–2.44]) for the primary outcome of a composite of symptomatic VTE, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, acute limb ischemia, non-CNS systemic arterial embolism, all-cause hospitalization, and all-cause mortality up to day 35.

### Enrollment of females in randomized Trials for glucagon-like peptide 1 Receptor agonists: a systematic review [^114Gmbiv]. JACC: Advances (2024). Medium credibility.

Methodology

The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. Approval from the Institutional Review Board was not required for this study as publicly available data were utilized. This study was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO), with the identification number.

Data sources and searches

The literature search was performed using PubMed/MEDLINE, Ovid/Embase, Google Scholar, and clinicaltrials.gov from database inception until April 2024. Search terms included "glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists", "GLP-1 agonist", "GLP-1RA", "semaglutide", "dulaglutide", "albiglutide", "exenatide", "liraglutide", "lixisenatide", "efpeglenatide", "placebo", "cardiovascular disease", "cardiovascular risk factors", "randomization", "clinical trials", "intervention studies", and synonyms. Citations of selected articles and any relevant studies that evaluated GLP-1RA and CV outcomes were reviewed. After removing duplicates, records were reviewed at the title and abstract level, followed by the screening of full text based on our study criteria. If a trial did not reach the analysis phase, it was excluded from our study. Data for each randomized trial were abstracted for each study and subsequently grouped by year of publication.

Study selection

The prespecified inclusion criteria were as follows: 1) cardiometabolic RCTs on GLP-1RA; 2) sample size of at least 100 participants and follow-up duration of at least 12 weeks; and 3) English language. As with the previous published pooled studies, we selected large RCTs with follow-up periods of 12 weeks. The treatment was either monotherapy of GLP-1RA or added GLP-1RA to nonrandomized background hypoglycemia treatments. The comparator could be a placebo or any antidiabetic medications. We excluded RCTs performed among patients younger than 18 years, and those reporting secondary, interim, or post hoc analyses. We also excluded open-label extension trials and those RCTs wherein GLP-1RA are mixed with insulin or other antidiabetic agents as 1 drug preparation. Lastly, our study focused mainly on pure GLP-1RAs; hence, we did not include tirzepatide and other dual agents (Supplemental Figure 1).

### Generalizability of the results of cardiovascular outcome trials of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^1149DTGZ]. Diabetes Therapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

This study aimed to investigate the generalizability of the results of cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) to Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).

Methods

The 3B (Blood Glucose, Blood Pressure, and Blood Lipid) population, a nationally representative population of patients with T2DM in China (n = 25,411), was examined for eligibility of enrollment in four GLP-1 RAs CVOTs (Dulaglutide-REWIND, Exenatide-EXSCEL, Liraglutide-LEADER, and Semaglutide-SUSTAIN-6). We first estimated the proportion of 3B population who would meet the six inclusion and exclusion (I/E) criteria, namely age, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), body mass index (BMI), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), history of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and antidiabetic medication, in each CVOT. Then we compared 11 baseline characteristics, namely age, gender, duration of diabetes, HbA1c, BMI, eGFR, history of CVD, prior myocardial infarction (MI), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and systolic blood pressure, between the population in each CVOT and the 3B population. Lastly, we estimated the proportion of 3B population that matched the characteristics in each CVOT population.

Results

On the basis of the I/E criteria, 31.1% of the 3B population would have been eligible for enrollment in REWIND, 15.0% for SUSTAIN-6, 12.9% for LEADER, and 11.3% for EXSCEL. On the basis of the baseline characteristics, REWIND most closely matched the 3B population on gender, duration of diabetes, HbA1c, DBP, LDL-c, history of CVD, and prior MI. The proportion of 3B population matching on at least eight or at least ten baseline characteristics with CVOT populations was highest for REWIND compared to other CVOTs.

Conclusion

Among the four GLP-1 RA CVOTs, the REWIND trial using once-weekly dulaglutide is most generalizable to Chinese patients with T2DM.

### Efficacy and tolerability of exenatide once weekly over 7 years in patients with type 2 diabetes: an open-label extension of the DURATION-1 study [^112CiuZh]. Journal of Diabetes and Its Complications (2019). Medium credibility.

Aims

To investigate the glycemic efficacy, effects on cardiovascular risk factors, and safety of exenatide once weekly (QW) in patients with type 2 diabetes over 7 years in the DURATION-1 study.

Methods

Patients were initially randomized to exenatide QW 2 mg or exenatide twice daily for 30 weeks, after which they received open-label, open-ended treatment with exenatide QW 2 mg for up to 7 years. Efficacy analyses included changes from baseline in glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1C) and cardiovascular risk factors.

Results

Of 295 patients in the intention-to-treat population, 122 (41%) completed 7 years of treatment. Patients in the 7-year completer population showed sustained glycemic improvements from baseline (7-year least-squares mean [LSM] change in HbA 1C, -1.53%) and significant improvements in several cardiovascular risk factors, including body weight, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Seven-year completers who received no additional glucose-lowering therapies (n = 65 [53%]) had similar improvements in HbA 1C, and numerically greater reductions in body weight (7-year LSM change, -6.46 kg vs -3.87 kg), compared with the overall cohort. There were no unexpected safety findings.

Conclusions

Treatment with exenatide QW for 7 years was associated with sustained improvements in glycemic control and several cardiovascular risk factors.

### Albiglutide and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (harmony outcomes): a double-blind, randomised placebo-controlled trial [^115aTxt6]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Background

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists differ in chemical structure, duration of action, and in their effects on clinical outcomes. The cardiovascular effects of once-weekly albiglutide in type 2 diabetes are unknown. We aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of albiglutide in preventing cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke.

Methods

We did a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial in 610 sites across 28 countries. We randomly assigned patients aged 40 years and older with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (at a 1:1 ratio) to groups that either received a subcutaneous injection of albiglutide (30–50 mg, based on glycaemic response and tolerability) or of a matched volume of placebo once a week, in addition to their standard care. Investigators used an interactive voice or web response system to obtain treatment assignment, and patients and all study investigators were masked to their treatment allocation. We hypothesised that albiglutide would be non-inferior to placebo for the primary outcome of the first occurrence of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke, which was assessed in the intention-to-treat population. If non-inferiority was confirmed by an upper limit of the 95% CI for a hazard ratio of less than 1.30, closed testing for superiority was prespecified. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02465515.

Findings

Patients were screened between July 1, 2015, and Nov 24, 2016. 10793 patients were screened and 9463 participants were enrolled and randomly assigned to groups: 4731 patients were assigned to receive albiglutide and 4732 patients to receive placebo. On Nov 8, 2017, it was determined that 611 primary endpoints and a median follow-up of at least 1.5 years had accrued, and participants returned for a final visit and discontinuation from study treatment; the last patient visit was on March 12, 2018. These 9463 patients, the intention-to-treat population, were evaluated for a median duration of 1.6 years and were assessed for the primary outcome. The primary composite outcome occurred in 338 (7%) of 4731 patients at an incidence rate of 4.6 events per 100 person-years in the albiglutide group and in 428 (9%) of 4732 patients at an incidence rate of 5.9 events per 100 person-years in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.78, 95% CI 0.68–0.90), which indicated that albiglutide was superior to placebo (p < 0.0001 for non-inferiority; p = 0.0006 for superiority). The incidence of acute pancreatitis (ten patients in the albiglutide group and seven patients in the placebo group), pancreatic cancer (six patients in the albiglutide group and five patients in the placebo group), medullary thyroid carcinoma (zero patients in both groups), and other serious adverse events did not differ between the two groups. There were three (< 1%) deaths in the placebo group that were assessed by investigators, who were masked to study drug assignment, to be treatment-related and two (< 1%) deaths in the albiglutide group.

Interpretation

In patients with type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, albiglutide was superior to placebo with respect to major adverse cardiovascular events. Evidence-based glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists should therefore be considered as part of a comprehensive strategy to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes.

### Cardiovascular risk reduction with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists is proportional to HbA1c lowering in type 2 diabetes: an updated meta-regression analysis incorporating FLOW and SOUL trials [^113Suts7]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Aims

To evaluate relationships of cardiovascular and kidney outcomes with glycemic or bodyweight reductions in randomised placebo‐controlled trials of glucagon‐like peptide‐1 receptor agonists (GLP‐1RAs), incorporating data from FLOW and SOUL trials.

Materials and Methods

PubMed and EMBASE were searched up to 22 August 2025 for placebo‐controlled randomized trials of oral or bolus‐type, subcutaneous GLP‐1RAs reporting major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE; a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) in adults with type 2 diabetes. The primary outcome was MACE; secondary outcomes included heart failure (HF) and kidney outcomes. Random‐effects meta‐analyses were followed by meta‐regression evaluating associations with HbA1c and bodyweight reduction.

Results

A total of 73 263 individuals were included from 10 trials (ELIXA, LEADER, SUSTAIN‐6, EXSCEL, Harmony Outcomes, PIONEER 6, REWIND, AMPLITUDE‐O, FLOW, and SOUL). GLP‐1RAs reduced MACE by 14% (hazard ratio: 0.86; 95% CI: 0.82 to 0.91; p < 0.001), as well as hospitalisation for HF and the composite kidney outcome (both p < 0.001). Meta‐regression showed that every 1% extra reduction in HbA1c corresponded to a 27% lower HR for MACE (p = 0.015; R 2 = 0.61). While HbA1c reduction was not significantly associated with secondary outcomes, the directionality was consistent with MACE. Bodyweight change was not associated with any of the analysed endpoints, including MACE (p = 0.13; R 2 = 0.21).

Conclusions

HbA1c reduction, not bodyweight change, was significantly and proportionally associated with MACE risk reduction. HbA1c lowering may serve as a useful surrogate for the cardiovascular improvements associated with GLP‐1RAs in type 2 diabetes.
