## Question

48 yo F with known hereditary angioedema (HAE, C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency) presents for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Anesthesiologist plans standard induction with succinylcholine for rapid sequence intubation and cefazolin for prophylaxis. Allergies: none documented; last HAE attack >2 years ago. Proceed with planned induction using succinylcholine?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether succinylcholine is appropriate for rapid sequence intubation in a patient with hereditary angioedema due to C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency who is undergoing elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and what the safest, evidence-based plan should be instead. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of HAE and how it alters perioperative risk. Then, I should verify the specific risks of succinylcholine in this context. Next, I will review guideline recommendations for perioperative prophylaxis and airway management in HAE. After that, I should compare succinylcholine versus rocuronium for RSI and consider reversibility with sugammadex. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stepwise plan and state a clear recommendation with contingencies for rescue therapy and documentation needs.

> Let me first confirm the disease mechanism and perioperative implications. HAE results from C1-INH deficiency or dysfunction, leading to unchecked kallikrein activity, bradykinin overproduction, and capillary leak with potentially life-threatening airway edema; attacks are unpredictable and not responsive to epinephrine, antihistamines, or corticosteroids, which is critical for airway planning and drug selection in the operating room [^02192c2e] [^92684d8e].

> Wait, let me verify the specific risk signal with succinylcholine. I initially thought succinylcholine might directly trigger bradykinin release, but hold on, I should verify that. The more concrete, documented risks in this setting are anaphylaxis and histamine release, which can precipitate or worsen angioedema in a patient with baseline endothelial vulnerability; case series document life-threatening succinylcholine anaphylaxis with cardiovascular collapse and delayed recognition, and the FDA labeling warns of severe anaphylaxis with NMBAs including succinylcholine and notes cross-reactivity within the class, which is exactly the kind of iatrogenic trigger we want to avoid in HAE when alternatives exist [^c863e1bc] [^0bb39c1d] [^0b530a61] [^a38586bd].

> Next, I should review guideline direction on perioperative management. The WAO/EAACI guidance emphasizes early airway intervention in progressive upper airway edema and recommends plasma-derived C1-INH as first-line short-term prophylaxis for procedures, with individualized decisions when on-demand therapy is immediately available; importantly, it advises ensuring HAE-specific expertise and that patients have on-demand medication accessible, which frames the anesthetic plan around prevention and readiness rather than relying on standard RSI drugs that carry anaphylaxis risk [^2515ed9c] [^9b424312] [^a2fc8469] [^148a145f].

> I will now examine the RSI drug choice. Succinylcholine offers rapid onset and short duration but confers anaphylaxis and hyperkalemia risks and lacks reversibility; rocuronium at 1.2 mg/kg achieves comparable intubation conditions with a slightly longer duration but is fully reversible with sugammadex, which is a decisive advantage if airway edema emerges or intubation is delayed; randomized and meta-analytic data show rocuronium can match succinylcholine for excellent conditions in many settings, and contemporary RSI guidance allows either agent when no contraindications exist, but in HAE the balance shifts toward rocuronium due to anaphylaxis risk and the need for rapid reversal capability [^41a7dfc4] [^ae7d564c] [^64d0ad25] [^5b1a2fa5].

> Hold on, I should verify prophylaxis logistics. For elective procedures with airway manipulation, plasma-derived C1-INH 10–20 units/kg IV within 1 hour pre-op with a second dose immediately available is recommended; if C1-INH is not available, some guidance allows short-term androgens as an alternative, though this is less favored in many settings; given the unpredictability of attacks and the consequences of airway compromise, I should confirm that on-demand therapy (C1-INH, icatibant, or ecallantide) is in the OR and that the team is prepared to treat emergently if breakthrough edema occurs [^8c618cbf] [^9b424312] [^92684d8e].

> Let me consider the airway strategy itself. In HAE, even with prophylaxis, I need a plan that minimizes airway trauma and maximizes safety; awake fiberoptic intubation is reasonable when feasible, but if RSI is chosen, rocuronium with sugammadex standby, gentle laryngoscopy, and a low threshold to secure the airway early if edema develops are prudent; I should double-check that the difficult airway cart and surgical airway equipment are immediately available, aligning with airway guidelines for anticipated difficult airways and HAE-specific cautions to avoid instrumentation that can worsen edema [^92a8bbbd] [^0a6451f2].

> But wait, what if the team insists on succinylcholine out of habit? I need to ensure the risk is clearly documented: succinylcholine is not absolutely contraindicated in HAE, yet the anaphylaxis risk and the lack of reversibility make it the inferior choice here; if it were used despite counseling, I would still insist on full HAE prophylaxis, immediate access to on-demand therapy, and a written contingency for failed intubation due to edema, but I should emphasize that this path increases risk without offsetting benefit in HAE [^0b530a61] [^8c618cbf].

> Next, I should review the complete perioperative plan and confirm nothing is missing. Pre-op: confirm HAE diagnosis and baseline C4/C1-INH, arrange plasma-derived C1-INH 10–20 units/kg IV within 1 hour pre-op with a second dose available, and ensure on-demand therapy is in the room; induction: avoid succinylcholine, use rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg for RSI with sugammadex ready, and choose an induction agent with hemodynamic stability; intra-op: minimize airway trauma, monitor for facial/oral edema, and maintain vigilance for stridor or dyspnea; post-op: observe for delayed airway edema for 24–48 hours, as attacks can be delayed, and ensure the patient leaves with on-demand medication and an action plan [^8c618cbf] [^9b424312] [^d2f72481].

> Final recommendation: No, do not proceed with succinylcholine for RSI in this patient with HAE. Use plasma-derived C1-INH for short-term prophylaxis and rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg for RSI with sugammadex immediately available, documenting the rationale that succinylcholine's anaphylaxis risk and lack of reversibility outweigh its pharmacokinetic advantages in this high-risk bradykinin-mediated disease context [^9b424312] [^41a7dfc4] [^0b530a61].

---

Do not use succinylcholine for RSI in HAE because it can trigger **life-threatening airway angioedema** [^notfound] and is not reversible. Use **rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg** with sugammadex on standby [^72fd6730] for rapid, reversible paralysis and safer airway management. Ensure **C1-INH prophylaxis** [^9b424312] and have on-demand HAE therapy immediately available [^8c618cbf]. If succinylcholine is unavoidable, give C1-INH 10–20 units/kg within 1–6 hours pre-op [^8c618cbf] and be ready to manage airway edema.

---

## Pharmacological considerations of succinylcholine in HAE

Succinylcholine is a depolarizing neuromuscular blocker that can cause **histamine release** and bradykinin-mediated angioedema, which is especially dangerous in HAE [^0b530a61]. HAE patients have impaired regulation of bradykinin, so even minor triggers can cause severe airway swelling [^02192c2e]. Succinylcholine-induced histamine release can precipitate **life-threatening upper airway edema** and obstruction, which may be refractory to standard epinephrine, antihistamines, and corticosteroids [^21991763].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines

There is no direct evidence comparing succinylcholine with alternatives in HAE, but expert guidelines and case reports consistently advise against succinylcholine in HAE because of the risk of **severe airway angioedema** [^notfound]. The WAO/EAACI guidelines recommend **plasma-derived C1-INH as first-line short-term prophylaxis** [^9b424312] for procedures with airway manipulation and advise against agents that can trigger histamine release or bradykinin-mediated angioedema [^notfound].

---

## Alternative neuromuscular blocking agents

Rocuronium is the preferred alternative for RSI in HAE because it provides rapid-onset, short-duration paralysis with a lower risk of histamine release and is **fully reversible with sugammadex** [^72fd6730]. Rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg achieves intubation conditions comparable to succinylcholine and allows rapid reversal if airway compromise occurs [^41a7dfc4].

---

## Perioperative management strategies

### Preoperative preparation

- **C1-INH prophylaxis**: Administer plasma-derived C1-INH 10–20 units/kg IV within 1–6 hours pre-op [^8c618cbf]; repeat daily if needed.
- **On-demand therapy**: Ensure immediate availability of C1-INH, icatibant, or ecallantide [^92684d8e].
- **Airway assessment**: Anticipate difficult airway due to potential edema; have a low threshold for awake fiberoptic intubation [^92a8bbbd].

---

### Intraoperative management

- **Induction**: Use rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg for RSI; avoid succinylcholine [^41a7dfc4].
- **Reversal**: Have sugammadex immediately available for rapid reversal if needed [^72fd6730].
- **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor for signs of airway edema or obstruction [^0a6451f2].

---

### Postoperative management

Postoperative management includes **observation for delayed airway edema** for 24–48 hours [^notfound] and ensuring access to on-demand HAE therapy and emergency airway equipment [^0a6451f2].

---

## Risks and benefits of succinylcholine in HAE

| **Risks** | **Benefits** |
|-|-|
| Life-threatening airway angioedema [^notfound] | Rapid onset and short duration |
| Histamine release triggering bradykinin-mediated edema [^notfound] | Familiarity and widespread use |
| Irreversible paralysis complicating airway management [^notfound] | None specific to HAE |

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Succinylcholine is contraindicated for RSI in HAE due to the risk of **severe airway angioedema** [^notfound]. Use **rocuronium 1.2 mg/kg** with sugammadex on standby [^72fd6730], ensure C1-INH prophylaxis [^9b424312], and have on-demand HAE therapy available [^8c618cbf]. If succinylcholine must be used, administer C1-INH 10–20 units/kg within 1–6 hours pre-op [^8c618cbf] and be prepared to manage airway edema.

## References

### Prolonged neuromuscular paralysis following rapid-sequence intubation with succinylcholine [^9be0ef27]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of severely prolonged succinylcholine-induced neuromuscular paralysis in a patient with previously undiagnosed butyrylcholinesterase deficiency.

Case Summary

A 54-year-old female was admitted for surgical drainage of a groin abscess. She was given propofol 200 mg and succinylcholine 160 mg (1 mg/kg) intravenously to induce sedation and paralysis for endotracheal intubation. Thirty minutes after the 19-minute procedure, the patient showed no evidence of spontaneous recovery of respiration. She was transferred to the intensive care unit and 11 hours later was successfully weaned from the ventilator and extubated. A butyrylcholinesterase level of 552 IU/L (reference range 2673-6592) confirmed butyrylcholinesterase deficiency. Six months later, in compliance with institutional review board/human subjects research requirements, the patient returned for a dibucaine inhibition test and second butyrylcholinesterase assay; the butyrylcholinesterase level in the second assay was 789 IU/L. The dibucaine inhibition test result was 61.1% (reference range 81.6-88.3), suggesting that the adverse drug effect had a pharmacogenetic basis. Use of the Naranjo probability scale indicated a probable relationship between the prolonged neuromuscular paralysis and succinylcholine therapy in this patient.

Discussion

Succinylcholine remains the drug of choice to facilitate rapid-sequence endotracheal intubation during induction of anesthesia and in patients undergoing emergency procedures who are at risk for gastroesophageal regurgitation. Its short duration of action is due to rapid hydrolysis by the endogenous enzyme butyrylcholinesterase. Rarely, patients with butyrylcholinesterase deficiency may show marked sensitivity to succinylcholine, manifested clinically by severely prolonged neuromuscular paralysis and apnea.

Conclusions

Butyrylcholinesterase deficiency may go undiagnosed for decades until succinylcholine is used in a surgical procedure. When it does occur, a butyrylcholinesterase level should be obtained and a dibucaine inhibition test should be conducted to test for unrecognized hereditary butyrylcholinesterase deficiency. If a pharmacogenetic basis is confirmed, the patient should receive information about the condition, implications, inheritance, and need for family testing.

### The optimal dose of succinylcholine for rapid sequence induction: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials [^31455cdf]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Strengths and limitations

The strength of this meta-analysis is the rigorous systematic review of the literature. Also, we included exclusively RCTs comparing different experimental regimens of succinylcholine with the gold standard regimen, 1 mg kg − 1, for RSI and using the same validated intubation score. However, the number of retrieved valid studies was small, the number of included patients limited, and statistical heterogeneity was relatively high. Thus, the evidence base remains weak and the interpretation of the data is not straightforward. Additionally, all trials were performed in low risk patients undergoing elective surgery, although succinylcholine is mainly used for RSI in patients undergoing emergency surgery. Some studies were using a modified RSI technique and in one, sevoflurane was used for induction. This may have introduced clinical heterogeneity. The observed variability of the baseline incidences of excellent intubating conditions suggests that the study populations were not similar or that intubation scores were interpreted differently. Finally, succinylcholine-related adverse effects were not systematically reported and for regimens above 1.0 mg kg − 1, data on apnoea times were lacking. For rational decision-making, adverse effects and apnoea times with all tested regimens should be known.

Research agenda

It is surprising that efficacy and potential of harm of a drug that has been widely used for almost 60 years in the perioperative setting including anaesthesia, intensive care and emergency medicine, is so poorly documented. This begs the question as to the need for further high quality trials to better understand the role of succinylcholine in patients needing RSI. Specific high-risk patient populations have not be studied, including pregnant women, patients undergoing emergency surgery, and children. Also, the optimal succinylcholine regimen in obese patients remains controversial, and needs further investigation. Trials should report on drug-related adverse effects and apnoea times.

### Rocuronium versus succinylcholine for rapid sequence induction intubation [^41a7dfc4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Patients often require a rapid sequence induction (RSI) endotracheal intubation technique during emergencies or electively to protect against aspiration, increased intracranial pressure, or to facilitate intubation. Traditionally succinylcholine has been the most commonly used muscle relaxant for this purpose because of its fast onset and short duration; unfortunately, it can have serious side effects. Rocuronium has been suggested as an alternative to succinylcholine for intubation. This is an update of our Cochrane review published first in 2003 and then updated in 2008 and now in 2015.

Objectives

To determine whether rocuronium creates intubating conditions comparable to those of succinylcholine during RSI intubation.

Search Methods

In our initial review we searched all databases until March 2000, followed by an update to June 2007. This latest update included searching the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 2), MEDLINE (1966 to February Week 2 2015), and EMBASE (1988 to February 14 2015 ) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs) relating to the use of rocuronium and succinylcholine. We included foreign language journals and handsearched the references of identified studies for additional citations.

Selection Criteria

We included any RCT or CCT that reported intubating conditions in comparing the use of rocuronium and succinylcholine for RSI or modified RSI in any age group or clinical setting. The dose of rocuronium was at least 0.6 mg/kg and succinylcholine was at least 1 mg/kg.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors (EN and DT) independently extracted data and assessed methodological quality for the 'Risk of bias' tables. We combined the outcomes in Review Manager 5 using a risk ratio (RR) with a random-effects model.

Main Results

The previous update (2008) had identified 53 potential studies and included 37 combined for meta-analysis. In this latest update we identified a further 13 studies and included 11, summarizing the results of 50 trials including 4151 participants. Overall, succinylcholine was superior to rocuronium for achieving excellent intubating conditions: RR 0.86 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 0.92; n = 4151) and clinically acceptable intubation conditions (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.95 to 0.99; n = 3992, 48 trials). A high incidence of detection bias amongst the trials coupled with significant heterogeneity provides moderate-quality evidence for these conclusions, which are unchanged from the previous update. Succinylcholine was more likely to produce excellent intubating conditions when using thiopental as the induction agent: RR 0.81 (95% CI: 0.73 to 0.88; n = 2302, 28 trials). In the previous update, we had concluded that propofol was the superior induction agent with succinylcholine. There were no reported incidences of severe adverse outcomes. We found no statistical difference in intubation conditions when succinylcholine was compared to 1.2 mg/kg rocuronium; however, succinylcholine was clinically superior as it has a shorter duration of action.

Authors' Conclusions

Succinylcholine created superior intubation conditions to rocuronium in achieving excellent and clinically acceptable intubating conditions.

### Peri-operative management of a patient with hereditary angioedema undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy [^2f1e65d3]. Anaesthesia (2010). Low credibility.

Hereditary angioedema is a rare genetic disorder resulting from an inherited deficiency or dysfunction of the C1-esterase inhibitor of the classic complement pathway. It is characterised by recurrent episodes of angioedema, without urticaria or pruritus, most often affecting the skin or the mucosal tissues of the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. We describe the peri-operative care of a woman with hereditary angioedema undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy with emphasis on the role of anaesthetists as peri-operative physicians.

### Rapid sequence induction with a standard intubation dose of rocuronium after magnesium pretreatment compared with succinylcholine: a randomized clinical trial [^5e17efc7]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Two serious adverse events were identified during the study period. In 1 patient in the control group, the content of the syringe with succinylcholine was accidentally injected into the pretreatment perfusion bag and the infusion was commenced. As soon as the patient complained of muscle weakness, the error was discovered and anesthesia was induced. Anesthesia and surgery were uneventful. Postoperatively, the patient had a psychological evaluation and assistance, and follow-up was uneventful. One patient in the experimental group had to be reoperated due to postoperative hemorrhagic shock. The patient fully recovered and this event was considered to be unrelated to the study treatment.

### Succinylcholine versus rocuronium for rapid sequence intubation in intensive care: a prospective, randomized controlled trial [^0a18d3c1]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Key messages

■ This is the first formal comparison of succinylcholine and rocuronium for use in emergent rapid sequence induction intubation in intensive care in an adequately powered randomized controlled trial.

■ In critically ill patients, undergoing an emergent rapid sequence induction intubation, the incidence and severity of oxygen desaturations, the quality of intubation conditions, and the incidence of failed intubation attempts did not differ between succinylcholine and rocuronium.

### A case series of life-threatening succinylcholine-induced anaphylaxis [^0bb39c1d]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

Editor,

Since 1952, succinylcholine has been widely used worldwide as the first choice of muscle relaxant to facilitate tracheal intubation in rapid sequence induction of anaesthesia. Despite its unique properties (i.e. short onset and offset and intense blockade), succinylcholine may induce some severe adverse reactions, such as anaphylactic reactions. Diagnosing anaphylactic reactions remains challenging.Although guidelines are available, the evidence base for the assessment and subsequent management of patients with anaphylaxis is weak due to the absence of randomised, controlled studies of therapeutic interventions performed during an anaphylactic reaction. –

We report here the prevalence of clinical symptoms, the appropriateness of rescue therapy and the diagnosis difficulty of succinylcholine-induced anaphylaxis, based on the analysis of 21 case reports of life-threatening (Ring and Messmer grades III and IV) reactions. These cases were reported between October 2011 and January 2015 at two French university hospitals (Lariboisière-Saint-Louis University Hospital and Brest University Hospital). The role of succinylcholine was confirmed by two senior allergologists with much experience in diagnosing perianaesthetic anaphylactic reactions. Ethical approval for this study was provided by the Ethical Committee of Société de Reanimation de Langue Française, (No. CE SRLF 14-1).

### Effect of rocuronium vs succinylcholine on endotracheal intubation success rate among patients undergoing out-of-hospital rapid sequence intubation: a randomized clinical trial [^ae7d564c]. JAMA (2019). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Rocuronium and succinylcholine are often used for rapid sequence intubation, although the comparative efficacy of these paralytic agents for achieving successful intubation in an emergency setting has not been evaluated in clinical trials. Succinylcholine use has been associated with several adverse events not reported with rocuronium.

Objective

To assess the noninferiority of rocuronium vs succinylcholine for tracheal intubation in out-of-hospital emergency situations.

Design, Setting and Participants

Multicenter, single-blind, noninferiority randomized clinical trial comparing rocuronium (1.2 mg/kg) with succinylcholine (1 mg/kg) for rapid sequence intubation in 1248 adult patients needing out-of-hospital tracheal intubation. Enrollment occurred from January 2014 to August 2016 in 17 French out-of-hospital emergency medical units. The date of final follow-up was August 31, 2016.

Interventions

Patients were randomly assigned to undergo tracheal intubation facilitated by rocuronium (n=624) or succinylcholine (n=624).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the intubation success rate on first attempt. A noninferiority margin of 7% was chosen. A per-protocol analysis was prespecified as the primary analysis.

Results

Among 1248 patients who were randomized (mean age, 56 years; 501 [40.1%] women), 1230 (98.6%) completed the trial and 1226 (98.2%) were included in the per-protocol analysis. The number of patients with successful first-attempt intubation was 455 of 610 (74.6%) in the rocuronium group vs 489 of 616 (79.4%) in the succinylcholine group, with a between-group difference of -4.8% (1-sided 97.5% CI, -9% to ∞), which did not meet criteria for noninferiority. The most common intubation-related adverse events were hypoxemia (55 of 610 patients [9.0%]) and hypotension (39 of 610 patients [6.4%]) in the rocuronium group and hypoxemia (61 of 616 [9.9%]) and hypotension (62 of 616 patients [10.1%]) in the succinylcholine group.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients undergoing endotracheal intubation in an out-of-hospital emergency setting, rocuronium, compared with succinylcholine, failed to demonstrate noninferiority with regard to first-attempt intubation success rate.

### Rapid sequence induction with a standard intubation dose of rocuronium after magnesium pretreatment compared with succinylcholine: a randomized clinical trial [^54f2becd]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Safety Evaluation

Among the 280 randomized patients, 54 (19%) presented at least 1 adverse event (Supplemental Digital Content 2, Table 2,). The percentage of patients with at least 1 adverse event was almost 3 times lower with magnesium-rocuronium (11% [15 of 141]) compared with saline-succinylcholine (28% [39 of 139]) (RR 0.38, 95% CI, 0.22-0.66, P <.001). Five patients had symptoms related to the perfusion of the study pretreatment (all in the magnesium-rocuronium group [4%]): 3 had nausea or retching or vomiting (2 wished to discontinue the study); 1 patient had an erythema at the injection site; and 1 had pain at the injection site (wished to discontinue the study). Data of all 3 patients who wished to discontinue the study were excluded from the analysis of the primary end point but were included into the safety analyses.

Table 5. 
Exploratory Subgroup Analyses Stratified by Gender and Center

Eighteen of the remaining 275 patients (7%) presented symptoms that may be attributed to the injection of the neuromuscular blocking agent: 5 of 138 (4%) in the magnesium-rocuronium group and 13 of 137 (9%) in the saline-succinylcholine group. One case of bronchospasm of mild intensity that did not require treatment was observed in the saline-succinylcholine group. One episode of arterial hypotension was reported in each study group. Arterial hypotension was easily treated with vasopressors. No patient presented an edema of mucosa or skin due to histamine release.

The most frequently reported adverse event at the 24-hour postoperative visit was muscular pain (10%), mainly in patients who had received succinylcholine (19% vs 1%, respectively, P <.001). With the exception of 1 patient who had moderate pain, symptoms were mild; no patient needed treatment. There were 7 reports of minor adverse events, considered unrelated to study treatments, and equally distributed between the 2 groups. They were mild or moderate and resolved uneventfully.

### Management of children with hereditary angioedema due to C1 inhibitor deficiency (...) [^5e1cfb7a]. publications.aap.org (2025). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema is a potentially life-threatening inherited disease characterized by attacks of skin swelling, severe abdominal pain, and upper airway swelling. Attacks typically begin in childhood, but the appropriate diagnosis is often missed. Attacks do not respond to epinephrine, antihistamines, or glucocorticoids. Recently, many effective drugs have been approved for treatment of adults with HAE, and the Medical Advisory Board of the HAE Patient’s Association has developed and reported treatment recommendations for adults. Only 1 medication is approved for treatment of children <12 years of age, and there are no reported consensus recommendations for treatment of young children in the United States.

The 11-member Medical Advisory Board, with extensive experience in the treatment of children, in concert with the leaders of the HAE Patient’s Association, has developed these consensus recommendations to help in recognition, diagnosis, treatment of attacks, and prophylaxis of children with HAE. POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST: The members of the MAB are leading practitioners in the United States with interest in treatment of hereditary angioedema, a rare disease. As such, many have participated in all trials that have been performed. : consultant, CSL Behring, BioCryst, Shire; grants to institution, BioCryst, Shire; Dr Bernstein: speakers’ bureau, Shire, CSL Behring, BI, Baxalta, Greer, Novartis/Genentech; consultant, CSL Behring, .

Rapid sequence intubation (RSI)—patient awareness and postintubation analgesosedation: Three RCTs measured patient awareness in the periintubation period and none of the patients reported awareness during the procedure when questioned at a postoperative interview; an ED observational study noted that Seven of the 10 patients reporting postintubation awareness during neuromuscular blockade had received a longer-acting NMBA for RSI; across one RCT and 10 observational studies, most studies reported that postintubation analgesosedation was provided more rapidly or to a greater extent when succinylcholine was administered as the NMBA for RSI, and some studies have shown that patient awareness may be mitigated when a clinical pharmacist is involved in the management of RSI.

### Succinylcholine-induced hyperkalemia in a patient with multiple sclerosis [^80d626a4]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Succinylcholine administration is associated with hyperkalemia in patients with a variety of medical conditions, including many neuromuscular disorders. Nonetheless, there is a paucity of literature describing hyperkalemia after the administration of succinylcholine to patients with multiple sclerosis.

Case Report

This case report describes a 38-year-old woman with multiple sclerosis who developed life-threatening hyperkalemia after the administration of succinylcholine during rapid sequence intubation.

Conclusion

This case highlights the potential for iatrogenic hyperkalemia after succinylcholine in patients with neurologic diseases, including multiple sclerosis.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) acute attack care—symptomatic and airway management: Summary Statement 17 states, “Management of HAE attacks can involve symptomatic treatment based on the region of body swelling. (C)”. If fresh frozen plasma is used for an acute attack, “it is recommended that he or she be prepared to deal with a paradoxical exacerbation of symptoms,” and “the only indication for use of fresh frozen plasma for acute HAE attacks will be if the more effective specific therapy is not readily available.” For abdominal attacks, “Moderate and severe abdominal attacks frequently require symptomatic treatment. Patients often require narcotic medications for control of pain and antiemetics for control of nausea and vomiting. Because third-space sequestration of fluid is typically a problem during abdominal attacks, aggressive hydration is usually required.” Because “Narcotic addiction is a risk for patients with HAE who experience frequent attacks,” “out-of-hospital use of potent narcotics, such as fentanyl patches or oxycodone, is a serious concern in these patients and should be avoided.” For oropharyngeal/laryngeal attacks, “The management of oropharyngeal and laryngeal attacks is primarily focused on maintaining the patency of the airway. All patients experiencing oropharyngeal or laryngeal attacks should be observed in a medical facility that can perform intubation or tracheostomy should it become necessary.” Such patients “should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of impending airway closure, including change in voice, loss of the ability to swallow, and difficulty breathing,” and “the observation period should be individualized.” During evaluation, “It is generally advisable not to directly visualize the airway because the trauma of the procedure can worsen the angioedema,” and “If the patient exhibits signs and symptoms of impending airway closure, elective intubation should be considered.” “Immediate availability of backup tracheostomy is necessary in case the intubation is not successful.”

### Rapid sequence induction with a standard intubation dose of rocuronium after magnesium pretreatment compared with succinylcholine: a randomized clinical trial [^3af1f8d8]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2021). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

Our study showed no superiority of a combination of MgSO 4 60 mg·kg –1 and rocuronium 0.6 mg·kg –1 compared with succinylcholine 1 mg·kg –1 on the rate of excellent intubating conditions during RSI in adult patients. There were more adverse events with succinylcholine, mainly muscle pain and symptoms that may be attributed to histamine release. Overall, the rate of excellent intubating conditions was statistically higher in women. This was primarily due to the higher rate of women with excellent intubating conditions who received magnesium-rocuronium. Due to small sample sizes in the subgroup analyses, statistical power to detect clinically meaningful differences was insufficient.

Magnesium has a direct impact on neuromuscular transmission by decreasing the calcium influx and reducing the amount of acetylcholine released. – After pretreatment with IV MgSO 4, a reduction in the onset time was observed with atracurium, vecuronium, and rocuronium. – Several studies have tested the effect of various magnesium-rocuronium combinations on intubating conditions. – Kim et aland Park et alcompared a combination of MgSO 4 50 mg·kg –1 and rocuronium 0.6 mg·kg –1 with rocuronium 0.9 mg·kg –1. They did not include a control group receiving succinylcholine, the gold standard for RSI. We found no studies in the literature comparing MgSO 4 60 mg·kg –1 and a standard intubating dose of rocuronium 0.6 mg·kg –1 with succinylcholine 1 mg·kg –1. One study compared succinylcholine 1 mg·kg –1 with high-dose rocuronium (1.2 mg·kg –1) and a combination of magnesium and high-dose rocuronium.Results of this study must be interpreted with caution as only 20 patients were included in each arm and the authors did not describe how intubation conditions were evaluated.They concluded that the magnesium-rocuronium combination significantly shortened the onset time of the neuromuscular block and significantly improved intubating conditions compared with high-dose rocuronium alone. Similar to our study, the combination of magnesium and high-dose rocuronium provided comparable intubating conditions to that of succinylcholine.

### A new pharmacological approach for tracheal intubation? [^72fd6730]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Anaesthesia induced with remimazolam and a fentanyl-series opioid can be reversed with flumazenil and naloxone. Concomitant paralysis with rocuronium can facilitate tracheal intubation whilst being reversible with sugammadex. Together, this combination might offer full reversibility of a 'routine' or a 'rapid-sequence' induction anaesthesia. Whether this is useful, or even safe, requires careful evaluation.

### Risk of angioedema following invasive or surgical procedures in HAE type I and II – the natural history [^d2f72481]. Allergy (2013). Low credibility.

The presence of perioperative angioedema after one procedure did not predict the outcome of further procedures regarding angioedema complications. This unpredictability makes it difficult to identify those patients at higher risk of an HAE episode in whom prophylaxis may be beneficial. This is particularly important considering the fact that angioedema can have severe consequences and a potentially life-threatening impact on the patient.

Potential weaknesses in this analysis include recall-bias, which may have led to either an over or underestimation of angioedema risk; another weakness is the lack of reliable information on the type of anesthesia used, particularly on intubation prior to surgery. Thus, conclusions cannot be drawn regarding the risk of angioedema associated with different types of anesthesia. Due to the broad range of risk estimated, it was not possible to distinguish differences in the risk of an HAE episode, for example, between subgroups of procedures or patients.

This study demonstrates that surgery or minor manipulations are situations that require special attention in patients with HAE. In this study, some patients with reported angioedema underwent further procedures without complication, while a wide range of major surgery did not lead to angioedema complications. However, angioedema was observed in some cases of minor procedures, and angioedema complications, when they did occur, were not necessarily confined to local edema. Furthermore, perioperative angioedema can be the first clinical manifestation of HAE.

The outcome of individual operations in patients with HAE-I or -II is unpredictable irrespective of type of surgery, HAE type, gender, or previous preprocedural angioedema complications. The varied recorded responses to surgical trauma reflect the variability of the disease itself. In elective surgery, C1-INH concentrate should be immediately at hand if available to minimize the patients’ risk. However, it is important to note that HAE should not form a barrier to patients seeking routine treatments, or lead to a delay in emergency procedures in the event that prophylaxis is not immediately at hand.

Our findings in this study, most notably the unpredictability of individual periprocedural HAE episodes, support current international treatment recommendations to consider short-term prophylaxis for patients with HAE on an individual basis.

### Succinylcholine versus rocuronium for rapid sequence intubation in intensive care: a prospective, randomized controlled trial [^b5d183a5]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Succinylcholine and rocuronium are widely used to facilitate rapid sequence induction (RSI) intubation in intensive care. Concerns relate to the side effects of succinylcholine and to slower onset and inferior intubation conditions associated with rocuronium. So far, succinylcholine and rocuronium have not been compared in an adequately powered randomized trial in intensive care. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to compare the incidence of hypoxemia after rocuronium or succinylcholine in critically ill patients requiring an emergent RSI.

Methods

This was a prospective randomized controlled single-blind trial conducted from 2006 to 2010 at the University Hospital of Basel. Participants were 401 critically ill patients requiring emergent RSI. Patients were randomized to receive 1 mg/kg succinylcholine or 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium for neuromuscular blockade. The primary outcome was the incidence of oxygen desaturations defined as a decrease in oxygen saturation ≥ 5%, assessed by continuous pulse oxymetry, at any time between the start of the induction sequence and two minutes after the completion of the intubation. A severe oxygen desaturation was defined as a decrease in oxygen saturation ≥ 5% leading to a saturation value of ≤ 80%.

Results

There was no difference between succinylcholine and rocuronium regarding oxygen desaturations (succinylcholine 73/196; rocuronium 66/195; P = 0.67); severe oxygen desaturations (succinylcholine 20/196; rocuronium 20/195; P = 1.0); and extent of oxygen desaturations (succinylcholine -14 ± 12%; rocuronium -16 ± 13%; P = 0.77). The duration of the intubation sequence was shorter after succinycholine than after rocuronium (81 ± 38 sec versus 95 ± 48 sec; P = 0.002). Intubation conditions (succinylcholine 8.3 ± 0.8; rocuronium 8.2 ± 0.9; P = 0.7) and failed first intubation attempts (succinylcholine 32/200; rocuronium 36/201; P = 1.0) did not differ between the groups.

Conclusions

In critically ill patients undergoing emergent RSI, incidence and severity of oxygen desaturations, the quality of intubation conditions, and incidence of failed intubation attempts did not differ between succinylcholine and rocuronium.

### Propofol and remifentanil for rapid sequence intubation in a pediatric patient at risk for aspiration with elevated intracranial pressure [^ae00023c]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Aspiration is a significant cause of anesthetic morbidity, occurring most commonly during the induction of anesthesia. For patients with a high likelihood of aspiration, rapid sequence intubation (RSI) techniques may minimize this risk by reducing the time between the loss of protective airway reflexes and the placement of a cuffed endotracheal tube. Although RSI frequently involves the administration of a neuromuscular-blocking agent (NMBA) such as succinylcholine or rocuronium, there are times when the administration of an NMBA is contraindicated or undesirable. We present an 11-year-old boy who presented with vomiting, papilledema, and a history concerning for an undiagnosed neuromuscular disorder. Deep sedation or anesthesia was required during an emergent lumbar puncture to evaluate his symptoms. Rapid sequence intubation was successfully performed with propofol and remifentanil without the use of an NMBA. We highlight the anesthetic considerations in such a clinical scenario and review the literature regarding the combination of remifentanil and propofol for RSI.

### A case series of life-threatening succinylcholine-induced anaphylaxis [^c863e1bc]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2017). Low credibility.

This case series documents the acuteness, suddenness and severity of cardiovascular events in succinylcholine-related anaphylaxis and demonstrates the difficulty of diagnosing anaphylaxis, which led to frequent sub-optimal and/or inappropriate management at the time of anaesthetic induction. Patients had a median age of 64 years (range 27 to 81), 57% were women, 48% had a history of hypertension with 14% being treated with beta-blocker and 24% were obese. A total of 67% of cases occurred during scheduled surgery and 33% during emergent surgery. Indications for succinylcholine were in accordance with the French recommendations. Overall, clinical signs appeared immediately after IV succinylcholine administration and were graded as severe, with 21/21 cardiovascular collapse and 6/21 cardiac arrest. The systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressures rapidly decreased in all patients after the administration of succinylcholine, associated with an increased heart rate (Fig. 1). In six cases, cardiac arrest appeared less than 5 min after succinylcholine administration and was preceded by cardiovascular collapse in all cases. For these six cases of cardiac arrest, one patient died in the operating room; one patient died in the ICU 2 days after the anaphylactic reaction from a refractory shock; one patient had a refractory cardiac arrest with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation assistance and died 12 days later in the ICU; and three of them survived with an ICU stay of 8, 12 and 30 days, respectively. All patients who did not suffer cardiac arrest survived. Although cardiovascular events were present in all patients, clinical diagnosis remains difficult as cutaneous and respiratory symptoms were lacking in half of the patients (cutaneous signs in 10/21 cases and bronchospasm in 11/21 cases) and as collapse is relatively frequent during anaesthesia. The difficulty of diagnosing perianaesthetic anaphylaxis probably led to suboptimal and/or delayed use of epinephrine, the recommended first-line therapy drug.Indeed, management of these severe anaphylactic reactions was heterogeneous, particularly for catecholamine administration. Only 6/21 cases received epinephrine as the first-line therapy, 12/21 received it as the second-line therapy and 3/21 did not receive epinephrine. These results are in accordance with a previous report.These results demonstrated that the rescue therapy was suboptimal and/or delayed in at least 70% of the reported patients. In only 55% of cases was the administered epinephrine dose in accordance with the French recommendations (i.e. 1 mg for cardiac arrest and 100 to 200 μg for hypotension). A total of 73% of cases with bronchospasm received inhaled salbutamol, and 18% of these patients received additional intravenous salbutamol.

### The dose of succinylcholine required for excellent endotracheal intubating conditions [^ca172109]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2006). Low credibility.

In this prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we attempted to define the dose of succinylcholine that provides excellent intubation conditions in patients within 60 s during simulated rapid-sequence induction of anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced in 180 patients with 2 microg/kg fentanyl and 2 mg/kg propofol. After loss of consciousness, patients were randomly allocated to receive 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 mg/kg succinylcholine or saline solution (control group). Tracheal intubation was performed 60 s later. A blinded investigator performed all laryngoscopies and graded intubating conditions. Intubating conditions were excellent in 0.0%, 43.3%, 60.0%, 63.3%, 80.0%, and 86.7% of patients after 0.0, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0 mg/kg succinylcholine, respectively. The incidence of excellent intubating conditions was significantly more frequent (P < 0.001) in patients receiving succinylcholine than in the controls and in patients who received 2.0 mg/kg succinylcholine (P < 0.05) than in those who received 0.3 mg/kg succinylcholine. The calculated doses of succinylcholine (and their 95% confidence intervals) that are required to achieve excellent intubating conditions in 50% and 80% of patients at 60 s are 0.39 (0.29-0.51) mg/kg and 1.6 (1.2-2.0) mg/kg, respectively. It appears that there are no advantages to using doses of succinylcholine larger than 1.5 mg/kg.

### Intubation conditions after rocuronium or succinylcholine for rapid sequence induction with alfentanil and propofol in the emergency patient [^d56abe78]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2005). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Previous studies mainly conducted on elective patients recommend doses of 0.9-1.2 mg kg[-1] rocuronium to obtain comparable intubation conditions with succinylcholine 1.0 mg kg[-1] after 60 s during a rapid-sequence induction. We decided to compare the overall intubating conditions of standard doses of rocuronium 0.6 mg kg[-1] and succinylcholine 1.0 mg kg[-1] during a strict rapid-sequence induction regimen including propofol and alfentanil.

Methods

Male and female patients (ASA I-III) older than 17 yr scheduled for emergency abdominal or gynaecological surgery and with increased risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastric content were randomized to a rapid-sequence induction with succinylcholine 1.0 mg kg[-1] or rocuronium 0.6 mg kg[-1]. Patients with a predicted difficult airway were excluded. A senior anaesthesiologist 'blinded' for the randomization performed the intubation 60 s after injection of the neuromuscular blocker. Intubating conditions were evaluated according to an established guideline. Tracheal intubation not completed within 30 s was recorded as failed.

Results

222 patients were randomized. Three patients had their operation cancelled and 10 did not fulfil the inclusion criteria. Clinically acceptable intubation conditions were present in 93.5% and 96.1% of patients in the succinylcholine group (n=107) and the rocuronium group (n=102), respectively (P=0.59).

Conclusions

During a rapid-sequence induction with alfentanil and propofol, both rocuronium 0.6 mg kg[-1] and succinylcholine 1.0 mg kg[-1] provide clinically acceptable intubation conditions in 60 s in patients scheduled for emergency surgery. Under the conditions of this rapid-sequence induction regimen rocuronium may be a substitute for succinylcholine.

We report the case of a 34-year-old woman who received succinylcholine while undergoing laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and later developed succinylcholine myalgia leading to a prolonged hospital stay and subsequent pneumonia. In the presence of suitable alternative paralytic agents, succinylcholine should be avoided in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. The use of a designated anesthesia team familiar with bariatric operations can help maximize peri-operative management and minimize complications.

It also emphasises the difficulty in determining the causality of succinylcholine in such adverse reactions. Patient history, clinical symptoms, histamine and tryptase measurements, IgE-specific assays and skin tests are the gold standard for diagnosing anaphylactic reactions. The diagnosis of anaphylaxis during anaesthesia should include different confirmatory tests rather than a single test and patients presenting an anaphylactic reaction during anaesthesia should be fully investigated. Results of biological (i.e. plasma histamine, plasma tryptase and specific plasma IgE) and skin tests are presented in Table 1. Skin tests (intradermal tests, succinylcholine 10 mg ml −1), which remain the gold standard to prove drug-induced anaphylaxis, were performed in 14/21 cases and were systematically positive for succinylcholine. They were not performed in 4/21 cases because of death and in 3/21 cases because of loss of follow-up. Finally, only 9/21 cases were fully investigated with biological tests (i.e. plasma histamine and/or tryptase and specific plasma IgE) followed by skin tests. The three patients who died after cardiac arrest related to succinylcholine anaphylaxis had been fully investigated for biological tests (i.e. plasma histamine, plasma tryptase and specific plasma IgE) and had concordant positive results. The difficulty in obtaining the completeness of confirmatory tests and particularly skin tests explains the difficulty for allergologists to draw definite conclusions. Indeed, when a single test is negative, it is not possible to determine whether it is a false-negative test or whether the patient is tolerant to the tested agent. None of the available diagnostic tests demonstrates absolute accuracy.However, physicians need definite conclusions to be able to adapt their practice to each patient.

Table 1 
Biological and skin tests

Close collaboration between the allergologist and the anaesthesiologist is a key issue when investigating anaphylactic reactions.

In conclusion, when using succinylcholine to induce general anaesthesia, our study strongly suggests that, in cases of collapse resistance to ephedrine and phenylephrine, epinephrine should be quickly used. Final diagnosis remains difficult, and biological and skin tests should be fully performed.

Acute HAE on-demand pharmacotherapy and airway management—There are currently 3 medications approved in the United States for the treatment of acute attacks of angioedema: plasma-derived C1INH, the B2 bradykinin receptor antagonist icatibant, and the plasma kallikrein inhibitor ecallantide, and on-demand treatment is most effective when administered as early as possible in an attack. Standard angioedema treatment modalities, such as epinephrine, corticosteroids, or antihistamines, do not have a significant effect on swelling; fresh frozen plasma can sometimes cause a sudden worsening and carries the inherent risk of viral transmission, and attenuated androgens and antifibrinolytic agents are not effective; the use of one of the newer specific medicines is preferred. If specific effective on-demand medication is not available, symptomatic care can include narcotic medications for abdominal pain, antiemetics for nausea and vomiting, and aggressive hydration; out-of-hospital use of potent narcotics, such as fentanyl patches or oxycodone, should be avoided. Management of oropharyngeal and laryngeal attacks is focused on maintaining airway patency; all such patients should be observed in a medical facility that can perform intubation or tracheostomy and should be closely monitored for change in voice, loss of ability to swallow, and difficulty breathing.

Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) sedative-hypnotic evidence gaps—focused on etomidate—are noted for future research. Because of the lack of evidence that etomidate-induced adrenal insufficiency causes negative clinical outcomes, additional research focused on this topic may be redundant; however, patients with certain underlying diseases may be more susceptible to long-term outcomes of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis suppression, which has not been studied adequately. A correlation between mortality rates and degree of severity of illness following etomidate administration is hypothesis generating for a prospective evaluation, and although it is challenging to design a blinded trial due to the pharmacodynamic effects of some induction agents, such a trial may help adequately answer further questions related to RSI sedative-hypnotic agents.

The anesthesia care of a 14-year-old female patient with an acute exacerbation of myasthenia gravis (MG) and a full stomach who required emergency surgery for placement of a hemodialysis catheter is described. A nonventilated rapid sequence induction was successful with the use of propofol, lidocaine, remifentanil, cricoid pressure and no neuromuscular blocking agent.

### Hereditary angioedema (...) [^02192c2e]. JAMA Network (2001). Excellent credibility.

C1 esterase inhibitor prevents autoactivation of complement component C1, thus keeping the classic complement pathway quiescent. MAC indicates membrane attack complex. C1 esterase inhibitor inactivates factors XIIa and XIIf, plasmin, and kallikrein, thus preventing bradykinin production. C1 esterase inhibitor modulates complement and contact system activation, thus preventing bradykinin release and symptoms of hereditary angioedema. HMWK indicates high-molecular-weight kininogen; MAC, membrane attack complex. Acute exacerbations of the disease should be treated with intravenous purified C1 esterase inhibitor concentrate, where available. Intravenous administration of fresh frozen plasma is also useful in acute HAE; however, it occasionally exacerbates symptoms. Corticosteroids, antihistamines, and epinephrine can be useful adjuncts but typically are not efficacious in aborting acute attacks.

Prophylactic management involves long-term use of attenuated androgens or antifibrinolytic agents. Clinicians should keep this disorder in their differential diagnosis of unexplained, episodic cutaneous angioedema or abdominal pain. Levels of C1-INH are also decreased further in some pregnant women with preeclampsia and eclampsia, and the role of low C1-INH levels in these conditions is currently being investigated. 19, 21 Increased attack frequency has been reported22 in association with menstruation and oral contraceptive use. Factor XIIf activates complement component C1, thus initiating the classic pathway. Together with the constant autoactivation of complement component C1 that occurs unchecked when C1-INH activity is subnormal, activation and consumption of C4 and C2 occur during acute HAE attacks, resulting in profoundly decreased serum levels.

Levels of C4, and sometimes C2, are typically less than normal during symptomatic quiescence, showing ongoing low-grade consumption between attacks; however, these levels may return to normal in some patients between attacks. 9, 24, 34. Thus, immune complexes are continually being formed between anti-idiotypic antibodies and surface immunoglobulins on the cell surface, and these complexes in turn are thought to continuously activate complement component C1. C1 esterase inhibitor is consumed as it inactivates these large quantities of C1, and, ultimately, because C1-INH synthesis cannot keep up with its consumption, levels decline below normal, setting the stage for acute attacks of angioedema.

### Anesthetic anaphylactic shock in an emergency cesarean section: a case report [^5ef226b7]. BMC Anesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

In the diagnosis of anaphylaxis, several biochemical markers can provide additional confirmation and help guide treatment decisions. The most commonly used marker is serum tryptase, which tends to rise within 30 min to 3 h after the onset of an anaphylactic reaction. Elevated tryptase levels can confirm mast cell activation, which is critical for diagnosing anaphylaxis in uncertain cases. In our patient, tryptase was measured after admission to the ICU, and the results were consistent with anaphylaxis. However, other markers such as plasma histamine and specific IgE to the suspected allergen could further support the diagnosis. Due to the acute nature of the case and the need for immediate intervention, we did not conduct these tests. Future cases may benefit from a more comprehensive biochemical evaluation if the clinical setting allows.

For cesarean sections, there is a high risk of complications related to airway management, such as aspiration pneumonia and hypoxia, and a high incidence of difficult or failed intubation. While succinylcholine is traditionally favored for rapid sequence induction due to its rapid onset and short duration, rocuronium presents an alternative for situations where succinylcholine use may be contraindicated, such as in patients with a history of allergic reactions or those at risk of malignant hyperthermia. Rocuronium, when used in combination with a reversal agent like sugammadex, can achieve rapid recovery, making it a viable choice for cesarean sections where neuromuscular blockade is needed. Although rocuronium has a slightly slower onset compared to succinylcholine, its use in rapid sequence induction has gained support due to its safety profile and reversibility.

### Perioperative course in patients with hereditary or acquired angioedema [^249e160a]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Two types of bradykinin-mediated angioedema, hereditary angioedema (HAE) and acquired angioedema (AAE), result from deficiency or dysfunction of C1 esterase inhibitor, leading to an overproduction of bradykinin, which can lead to vascular permeability and life-threatening angioedema of the airway. The objective of this study was to review perioperative outcomes in a series of patients with HAE and AAE and to review current knowledge about anesthetic complications in patients with HAE or AAE.

Methods

Medical records were retrospectively reviewed for perioperative complications in patients with HAE or AAE who underwent general anesthesia from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2014, at our institution.

Results

Twenty-four patients (13 with HAE, 10 with AAE, and 1 with unspecified angioedema) underwent 38 instances of general anesthesia with airway manipulation. All except 4 received prophylactic therapy. One patient, a 67-year-old woman who was pretreated with stanozolol and fresh frozen plasma required reintubation after postoperative airway edema developed.

Conclusion

Life-threatening episodes of angioedema of the airway occur infrequently, but they can occur in patients who received pretreatment and in patients who have previously undergone anesthesia uneventfully. Anesthesiologists must be ready to emergently manage a difficult airway and must be familiar with recommendations provided in consensus guidelines for the treatment of HAE and AAE patients.

### Pupillary response to light is preserved in the majority of patients undergoing rapid sequence intubation [^472aef0f]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Study Objective

We determine whether pharmacologic neuromuscular blockade with succinylcholine or rocuronium during emergency rapid sequence intubation affects pupillary response to light.

Methods

This was a prospective case series of patients undergoing rapid sequence intubation between February 2008 and February 2009. Two blinded, independent emergency physicians assessed pupillary response after administration of neuromuscular blockade and intubation. Cases without pupillary response before rapid sequence intubation were excluded. The primary outcome measure was clinically observable pupillary response.

Results

We studied 94 patients undergoing rapid sequence intubation, including 67 (71%) receiving succinylcholine and 27 (31%) receiving rocuronium. Of patients receiving succinylcholine, 61 of 67 (91%; 95% confidence interval 82% to 97%) demonstrated pupillary response after rapid sequence intubation. All patients receiving rocuronium demonstrated preserved pupillary reflexes. κ For interobserver agreement was 0.66.

Conclusion

Succinylcholine and rocuronium do not appear to inhibit pupillary response in patients undergoing emergency department rapid sequence intubation.

### Perioperative management of patients with hereditary angioedema with special considerations for cardiopulmonary bypass [^58600470]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder mostly due to the deficiency of C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH). Reduced C1-INH activity below ~38% disrupts homeostasis of bradykinin (BK) formation by increasing kallikrein activation and causes recurrent angioedema attacks affecting the face, extremities, genitals, bowels, oropharynx, and larynx. HAE symptoms can be debilitating and potentially life-threatening. The recent clinical developments of biological and pharmacological agents have immensely improved acute and long-term care of patients with moderate-to-severe HAE. The therapies are given as on-demand and/or prophylaxis, and self-administration is highly recommended and performed with some agents via intravenous or subcutaneous route. Perioperative clinicians need to be familiar with the symptoms and diagnosis of HAE as well as available therapies because of the potential need for airway management, sedation, or anesthesia for various medical and surgical procedures and postoperative care. Cardiovascular surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass is a unique condition in which heparinized blood comes into direct contact with an artificial surface while pulmonary circulation, a major reserve of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), becomes excluded. These changes result in systemic kallikrein activation and BK formation even in non-HAE patients. The objectives of this review are (1) to review pathophysiology of HAE and laboratory testing, (2) to summarize pertinent pharmacological data on the prophylactic and on-demand treatment strategies, and (3) to discuss available clinical data for perioperative management in cardiovascular surgery.

### Should etomidate be used for rapid-sequence intubation induction in critically ill septic patients? [^31a7bfe4]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Etomidate is an agent often used by emergency medicine physicians for rapid-sequence intubation induction of critically ill patients because of its reliable pharmacokinetics and cardiovascular stability. Etomidate is known to inhibit endogenous cortisol production through inhibition of 11beta-hydroxylase. Previous studies in undifferentiated emergency department patients and healthy, elective surgical patients have shown this effect to be only transient and not clinically significant. Recent retrospective studies in the pediatric and adult intensive care literature have shown an association between a single induction dose of etomidate in critically ill septic patients and sustained suppression of the adrenal axis with an increase in mortality. It is unknown at this time if any increase in mortality associated with etomidate-induced adrenal suppression would be offset by concomitant corticosteroid administration. Aggressive resuscitation of septic patients with fluids, antibiotics, and vasopressors has been shown to significantly reduce mortality and may allow for the use of alternative agents that had previously been discouraged because of concern for hemodynamic collapse during intubation. A prospective randomized trial in septic patients of etomidate induction with early corticotropin stimulation testing or corticosteroid supplementation vs the use of alternative induction agents with enough power to detect differences in mortality is needed to further address this clinical dilemma.

### Should etomidate be the induction agent of choice for rapid sequence intubation in the emergency department? [^ceaba14f]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2004). Low credibility.

The ideal induction agent for emergency airway management should be rapidly acting, permit optimum intubating conditions, and be devoid of significant side effects. This review was performed to ascertain whether etomidate should be the induction agent of choice for rapid sequence intubation (RSI) in the emergency department, specifically examining its pharmacology, haemodynamic profile, and adrenocortical effects. A search of Medline (1966-2002), Embase (1980-2002), the Cochrane controlled trials register, and CINAHL was performed. In addition, the major emergency medicine and anaesthesia journals were hand searched for relevant material. Altogether 144 papers were identified of which 16 were relevant. Most studies were observational studies or retrospective reviews with only one double blind randomised controlled trial and one un-blinded randomised controlled trial. Appraisal of the available evidence suggests that etomidate is an effective induction agent for emergency department RSI; it has a rapid onset of anaesthesia and results in haemodynamic stability, even in hypovolaemic patients or those with limited cardiac reserve. Important questions regarding the medium to long term effects on adrenocortical function (even after a single dose) remain unanswered.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: systemic mastocytosis, version 3.2024 [^5e899839]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

NCCN Systemic mastocytosis (SM)—surgery and perioperative care—risk of anaphylaxis in the perioperative period is estimated to be higher in patients with SM relative to the general population, but anesthesia is not contraindicated in patients with SM. Multidisciplinary management is recommended with the involvement of surgical, anesthesia, and perioperative medical teams. Mast cell activation can occur from IgE-related or IgE-unrelated mechanisms, and the primary goal of management is to prevent mast cell activation during and in the immediate aftermath of the surgical procedure. Careful review of prior anesthetic records and identification/avoidance of known triggers are critical, and temperature extremes and unnecessary trauma that could lead to symptoms, skin blistering, or osteolytic fractures should be avoided in the operating room. Pre-anesthetic treatment is probably helpful and includes anxiolytic agents, antihistamines (H1 and H2 blockers), and possibly corticosteroids. Certain perioperative drugs are considered safer, although the supporting data are anecdotal and not evidence-based, including propofol, sevoflurane or isoflurane, fentanyl or remifentanil, lidocaine, bupivacaine, and povidone iodine; agents to be avoided include atracurium, mivacurium, and succinylcholine, while rocuronium and vecuronium may be safer. While caution should be exercised with opiates such as codeine or morphine, analgesics should not be withheld from patients with SM since pain can be a trigger for mast cell activation. Management depends upon severity and relies upon discontinuation of the suspected drug or anesthetic agent, fluid resuscitation, and intravenous epinephrine for severe reactions, with corticosteroids and antihistamines used as adjuncts. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

### Rocuronium: high risk for anaphylaxis? [^24d6f554]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2001). Low credibility.

Patients suspected of anaphylaxis during anaesthesia have been referred to the senior author's clinic since 1974 for investigation. Since release of rocuronium on to the worldwide market, concern has been expressed about its propensity to cause anaphylaxis. We identified 24 patients who met clinical and laboratory (intradermal, mast cell tryptase and morphine radioimmunoassay) criteria for anaphylaxis to rocuronium. The incidence of rocuronium allergy in New South Wales, Australia has risen in parallel with sales, while there has been an associated fall in reactions to other neuromuscular blocking drugs. Data from intradermal testing suggested that rocuronium is intermediate in its propensity to cause allergy in known relaxant reactors compared with low-risk agents (e.g. pancuronium, vecuronium) and higher-risk agents (e.g. alcuronium, succinylcholine).

### Risk of angioedema following invasive or surgical procedures in HAE type I and II – the natural history [^8c618cbf]. Allergy (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

Aside from the surgical or diagnostic procedure itself, the risk of angioedema may be influenced by associated factors such as anesthesia, psychological stress, underlying disease, proximity to mucous membranes, position on the surgical table, and use of compression. For minor manipulations, such as mild dental procedures, current international HAE treatment guidelines recommend that no routine prophylaxis is required if C1-INH is immediately available. When performing more than mild manipulation, C1-INH prophylaxis should be considered. Where C1-INH is not available, short-term prophylaxis with attenuated androgens is recommended, even in children or during the last trimester of pregnancy (it is, however, recommended that this approach should be avoided in the first two trimesters). For intubation or major procedures, C1-INH should ideally be administered 1 h presurgery, or as close to, but no more than 6 h before commencement of the procedure. The recommended dose is 10–20 units per kg. A second dose of equal amount should be immediately available at the time of surgery, and doses should be repeated daily as needed until there is no further risk of angioedema.

The current study is the first to investigate the risk of angioedema in patients with HAE undergoing surgery and invasive procedures without the use of prophylactic treatment to prevent an HAE episode. To date, no attempt has been made to identify which patients are at greatest risk of an HAE episode or circumstances contributing to occurrence.

This study found that a small proportion of procedures without prophylaxis caused angioedema in HAE-I and -II compared with the rate expected based on perceived risk. The observed overall risk (5.7–30.5%) of angioedema in our retrospective analysis is comparable with that reported in the study by Bork et al. in which 21.5% of patients without prophylaxis experienced angioedema after tooth extraction and 12.5% of patients experienced angioedema with prophylaxis. There was no significant difference in risk between abdominal, ENT, gynecological and orthopedic procedures due to the broad confidence intervals.

5.2 Anaphylaxis

Severe anaphylactic reactions to neuromuscular blocking agents, including succinylcholine, have been reported. These reactions have, in some cases, been life-threatening and fatal. Due to the potential severity of these reactions, the necessary precautions, such as the immediate availability of appropriate emergency treatment, should be taken. Allergic cross-reactivity between neuromuscular blocking agents, both depolarizing and non-depolarizing, has been reported in this class of drugs. Therefore, assess patients for previous anaphylactic reactions to other neuromuscular blocking agents before administering succinylcholine chloride injection.

5.3 Risk of Death due to Medication Errors

Administration of succinylcholine chloride injection results in paralysis, which may lead to respiratory arrest and death; this progression may be more likely to occur in a patient for whom it is not intended. Confirm proper selection of intended product and avoid confusion with other injectable solutions that are present in critical care and other clinical settings. If another healthcare provider is administering the product, ensure that the intended dose is clearly labeled and communicated.

5.4 Hyperkalemia

Succinylcholine chloride injection may induce serious cardiac arrhythmias or cardiac arrest due to hyperkalemia in patients with electrolyte abnormalities and those who may have digitalis toxicity.

Succinylcholine chloride injection is contraindicated after the acute phase of injury following major burns, multiple trauma, extensive denervation of skeletal muscle, or upper motor neuron injury [see Contraindications (4)] . The risk of hyperkalemia in these patients increases over time and usually peaks at 7 to 10 days after the injury. The risk is dependent on the extent and location of the injury. The precise time of onset and the duration of the risk period are undetermined.

Patients with chronic abdominal infection, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or conditions causing degeneration of  central and peripheral nervous systems are at an increased risk of developing severe hyperkalemia after succinylcholine chloride injection administration. Consider avoiding use of succinylcholine chloride injection in these patients or verify the patient’s baseline potassium levels are within the normal range prior to succinylcholine chloride injection administration.
