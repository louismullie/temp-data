## Question

Omega-3 fatty acids in heart health

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of omega-3 fatty acids in cardiovascular health. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the biological distinctions among omega-3 fatty acids and their mechanisms. Then, I should review the totality of randomized controlled trial evidence by indication and formulation. Next, I will reconcile conflicting meta-analyses and guidelines. After that, I should identify patient populations and dosing strategies where benefits are most likely. Finally, I will weigh safety, interactions, and practical prescribing recommendations, and close with a balanced bottom line that acknowledges uncertainties and evidence gaps.

> Let me first confirm the biological framework and mechanisms, because mechanistic plausibility often guides clinical interpretation when trials conflict. EPA and DHA are long-chain marine omega-3s with overlapping but distinct effects: triglyceride lowering, anti-inflammatory signaling via specialized pro-resolving mediators, membrane stabilization with antiarrhythmic potential, antithrombotic and endothelial effects, and modulation of eicosanoid pathways; DHA appears more chronotropic and may slow heart rate, whereas EPA may be more anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic, which could explain differential clinical effects by formulation [^112a6peu] [^114wFFUw] [^1171F4kq] [^115AyGRk].

> Wait, let me verify the dose–response for triglyceride lowering, since that is the most reproducible effect and often a surrogate for biological activity. High-certainty evidence shows that marine omega-3s reduce triglycerides by about 15% in a dose-dependent fashion, with clinically meaningful reductions typically at 2–4 g/day of EPA+DHA, and this effect is consistent across diverse populations and background therapies, supporting a true pharmacologic action even when hard outcomes are mixed [^1132gu2K] [^111UzR1B].

> Next, I should review the totality of randomized evidence for primary and secondary prevention, and I need to be careful not to over-interpret heterogeneous trials. Large, high-quality meta-analyses consistently show little to no effect of EPA+DHA supplementation on all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, stroke, or major adverse cardiovascular events in mixed-risk populations, with any signals for coronary events small, sensitive to risk of bias, and not robust to sensitivity analyses, which tempers enthusiasm for routine supplementation in general populations [^1132gu2K] [^111TbZAw] [^111q8QqR] [^11121mVg].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; formulation and dose may matter. Trials of EPA monotherapy, particularly icosapent ethyl at 4 g/day, have shown consistent and clinically important reductions in ischemic events in high-risk, statin-treated patients, including a 25% relative risk reduction in REDUCE-IT and corroborative signals in JELIS, whereas high-dose EPA+DHA combinations have not reproduced these benefits in contemporary trials like STRENGTH and OMEMI, suggesting that EPA-specific mechanisms beyond triglyceride lowering are operative and that DHA may blunt or not share these effects [^113Dxps2] [^111ScCn8] [^113Rfxyp] [^114UDXFs].

> I will now examine heart failure, because I recall earlier enthusiasm but should confirm with guideline-level sources. GISSI-HF demonstrated modest reductions in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations with 1 g/day EPA+DHA in symptomatic HFrEF, and contemporary heart failure guidelines give a Class IIa recommendation for omega-3 supplementation in symptomatic HF to reduce mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations, which remains the most consistent outcome signal outside of hypertriglyceridemia indications [^113vWvL2] [^112SkJaw].

> Let me consider hypertriglyceridemia and residual cardiovascular risk, since this is where prescription omega-3s are most clearly indicated. Prescription EPA (icosapent ethyl) at 4 g/day reduces triglycerides and, in REDUCE-IT, reduced a composite of ischemic events by 25% in patients with triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL and established ASCVD or diabetes with risk factors, with benefits extending across triglyceride strata and largely independent of achieved triglyceride level, supporting pleiotropic effects of EPA beyond triglyceride lowering [^111ScCn8] [^113Dxps2].

> But wait, what about safety signals that could offset benefits, especially at higher doses. Multiple large trials and meta-analyses show increased incident atrial fibrillation with omega-3 supplementation, particularly at higher doses and with EPA, and a signal for increased bleeding, so I should counsel patients with AF risk factors or on anticoagulants accordingly and monitor for arrhythmias when using high-dose formulations [^113zWY6F] [^1149iEXV].

> I should double-check the statin-era hypothesis and potential drug–nutrient interactions, because this often explains discordant results. Observational and post hoc analyses suggest that statins may attenuate benefits of mixed EPA+DHA supplements, whereas EPA monotherapy has shown benefit on top of statins; mechanistically, competition with arachidonic acid pathways and differing effects on inflammation and thrombosis provide a biologically plausible rationale for EPA-specific benefit in statin-treated patients, though this remains an area of ongoing debate and requires cautious interpretation [^114UDXFs] [^112TvhKz] [^113rgZ1p].

> Let me synthesize guideline positions to ensure my recommendations align with consensus. The AHA supports 1–2 servings of fatty fish per week for primary prevention and recognizes a role for omega-3s in secondary prevention and HF, while the 2022 HF guideline endorses omega-3s in symptomatic HF; diabetes guidelines do not recommend omega-3 supplements for CVD prevention in diabetes, reflecting neutral trial results like ORIGIN, and lipid guidelines emphasize prescription EPA for severe hypertriglyceridemia and residual risk rather than over-the-counter blends [^116WyyRb] [^113vWvL2] [^114CDTkC] [^1144J5ig].

> Now, I should translate this into practical prescribing, and I need to ensure dosing and formulations are precise. For hypertriglyceridemia with ASCVD risk, prescribe icosapent ethyl 4 g/day with meals; for symptomatic HFrEF, consider EPA+DHA 1 g/day as an adjunct; for general primary prevention, prioritize dietary intake of fatty fish rather than supplements; avoid relying on low-dose OTC blends for event reduction given consistent null results in modern RCTs, and monitor for AF and bleeding when using high-dose omega-3s, especially with antithrombotics [^111ScCn8] [^113vWvL2] [^1132gu2K] [^113zWY6F].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought DHA might share the same outcome benefits as EPA at high doses, but the failure of EPA+DHA trials like STRENGTH and OMEMI, alongside the consistent signal for EPA in REDUCE-IT and JELIS, suggests I should favor EPA monotherapy when targeting event reduction, reserving mixed formulations for triglyceride lowering or dietary adequacy goals rather than hard outcomes, pending further definitive trials [^113Rfxyp] [^113Dxps2] [^114UDXFs].

> In conclusion, I need to ensure the bottom line is clinically honest and reference-aligned. The evidence base is heterogeneous: EPA+DHA supplements have minimal impact on major cardiovascular outcomes in mixed-risk populations, whereas EPA monotherapy at 4 g/day confers meaningful event reduction in high-risk, statin-treated patients with elevated triglycerides, and 1 g/day EPA+DHA benefits symptomatic HF patients; safety considerations, especially AF risk, mandate individualized risk–benefit assessment and formulation selection, with dietary fish intake remaining a reasonable, low-risk strategy for primary prevention [^1132gu2K] [^111ScCn8] [^113vWvL2] [^113zWY6F] [^116WyyRb].

---

Omega-3 fatty acids (EPA/DHA) **lower triglycerides** [^1132gu2K] and may modestly reduce cardiovascular mortality and coronary events, especially in high-risk or secondary prevention settings [^1144J5ig] [^113vWvL2]. They **do not clearly reduce all-cause mortality** or stroke in general populations [^1132gu2K] [^111TbZAw], and high-dose EPA-only (icosapent ethyl) [^111ScCn8] provides the most consistent outcome benefit in statin-treated patients with elevated triglycerides [^111ScCn8]. For primary prevention, **eat 1–2 servings of fatty fish per week** [^116WyyRb]; for secondary prevention or hypertriglyceridemia, use 1–4 g/day of EPA/DHA, with EPA-only preferred at high doses [^111UzR1B] [^111ScCn8]. Omega-3s are generally safe but may increase bleeding risk and atrial fibrillation at high doses, so monitor accordingly [^1149iEXV] [^113zWY6F].

## Cardiovascular benefits of omega-3 fatty acids

### Triglyceride lowering

EPA and DHA **reduce triglycerides** by 20–50% at 2–4 g/day, with greater reductions at higher doses [^1132gu2K] [^111UzR1B]. This is the most consistent and clinically significant lipid effect of omega-3s [^1132gu2K].

---

### Anti-inflammatory and antiatherothrombotic effects

Omega-3s **reduce inflammation** [^113ikXSk] and platelet aggregation, and improve endothelial function, which may contribute to cardiovascular risk reduction beyond triglyceride lowering [^1147ESKf].

---

### Arrhythmia prevention

Omega-3s may **reduce sudden cardiac death** by stabilizing cardiac membranes and reducing malignant ventricular arrhythmias, particularly in secondary prevention settings [^113cFaNU] [^113vWvL2].

---

## Clinical evidence for cardiovascular outcomes

### Primary prevention

In primary prevention, **modest benefit** is suggested by observational studies, with higher omega-3 intake associated with lower cardiovascular risk [^1134TBoR] [^116xyR9Z]. However, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have not consistently shown significant reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) or all-cause mortality [^1132gu2K] [^111q8QqR].

---

### Secondary prevention

- **GISSI-Prevenzione**: 1 g/day EPA/DHA reduced cardiovascular mortality and sudden cardiac death in post-MI patients [^notfound].

- **GISSI-HF**: 1 g/day EPA/DHA reduced mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations in heart failure patients [^113vWvL2] [^112SkJaw].

- **JELIS**: 1.8 g/day EPA reduced major coronary events in hypercholesterolemic patients on statins [^114wFFUw].

- **REDUCE-IT**: 4 g/day icosapent ethyl (EPA-only) reduced cardiovascular events by 25% in high-risk, statin-treated patients with elevated triglycerides [^111ScCn8] [^113Dxps2].

---

### Heart failure

In heart failure, **omega-3 supplementation** (1 g/day EPA/DHA) is associated with reduced mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations, and is recommended as adjunctive therapy in symptomatic patients [^113vWvL2] [^111YdYiS].

---

## Controversies and conflicting evidence

- **STRENGTH and VITAL**: High-dose EPA/DHA combinations did not significantly reduce cardiovascular events in general populations, highlighting variability in outcomes across different formulations and populations [^113Rfxyp] [^113Dxps2].

- **Formulation differences**: EPA-only formulations (e.g. icosapent ethyl) appear more effective than combined EPA/DHA in reducing cardiovascular events, possibly due to distinct pharmacological properties [^1144J5ig] [^111ScCn8].

- **Statin interaction**: Some evidence suggests statins may attenuate omega-3 benefits, though this remains debated [^113rgZ1p] [^114UDXFs].

---

## Recommended intake and supplementation guidelines

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended intake** | **Formulation** |
|-|-|-|
| Primary prevention | 1–2 servings/week fatty fish | EPA/DHA from diet |
| Secondary prevention | 1 g/day | EPA/DHA (850–882 mg, 1:1.2 ratio) |
| Hypertriglyceridemia | 2–4 g/day | EPA-only (icosapent ethyl) preferred at high doses |
| Heart failure | 1 g/day | EPA/DHA (850–882 mg, 1:1.2 ratio) |

---

## Safety considerations and potential risks

- **Bleeding risk**: Omega-3s may increase bleeding risk, particularly at high doses or when combined with anticoagulants.

- **Atrial fibrillation**: High-dose omega-3s (especially EPA) have been associated with increased atrial fibrillation risk [^1149iEXV].

- **Gastrointestinal effects**: Mild gastrointestinal symptoms may occur with supplementation [^115uRkAU].

---

## Current clinical guidelines

- **AHA/ACC/HFSA**: Omega-3 supplementation is reasonable in heart failure patients (Class IIa) [^111YdYiS].

- **ESC**: Omega-3s are recommended for hypertriglyceridemia management, particularly EPA-only formulations [^notfound].

- **ADA**: Omega-3s are not recommended for primary or secondary cardiovascular prevention in diabetes, despite triglyceride-lowering benefits [^114CDTkC].

---

Omega-3 fatty acids, particularly EPA and DHA, **provide cardiovascular benefits** through triglyceride lowering, anti-inflammatory effects, and arrhythmia prevention. They are most effective in secondary prevention and hypertriglyceridemia, with EPA-only formulations showing superior outcomes. Primary prevention benefits are modest and inconsistent, and high-dose omega-3s carry potential risks, necessitating individualized patient assessment and monitoring.

### Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and cardiovascular diseases [^1177xo3E]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (omega-3 PUFA) therapy continues to show great promise in primary and, particularly in secondary prevention of cardiovascular (CV) diseases. The most compelling evidence for CV benefits of omega-3 PUFA comes from 4 controlled trials of nearly 40,000 participants randomized to receive eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) with or without docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in studies of patients in primary prevention, after myocardial infarction, and most recently, with heart failure (HF). We discuss the evidence from retrospective epidemiologic studies and from large randomized controlled trials showing the benefits of omega-3 PUFA, specifically EPA and DHA, in primary and secondary CV prevention and provide insight into potential mechanisms of these observed benefits. The target EPA + DHA consumption should be at least 500 mg/day for individuals without underlying overt CV disease and at least 800 to 1,000 mg/day for individuals with known coronary heart disease and HF. Further studies are needed to determine optimal dosing and the relative ratio of DHA and EPA omega-3 PUFA that provides maximal cardioprotection in those at risk of CV disease as well in the treatment of atherosclerotic, arrhythmic, and primary myocardial disorders.

### Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and cardiovascular health: a comprehensive review [^112yhcp7]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

The potential cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD) benefits of Omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (OM3) have been intensely studied and debated for decades. Initial trials were performed in patients with low use of maximal medical therapy for CVD, and reported significant mortality benefits with the use of 1 g/day OM3 intervention following myocardial infarction (MI). More recent studies, including cohorts of patients receiving modern guideline directed medical therapy for CVD, have often not shown similar benefits with OM3 use. We conducted a literature review using PubMed, professional society guidelines, specific journal databases including New England Journal of Medicine and Journal of the American College of Cardiology from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2017. References from selected articles were also reviewed, as well as key articles outside of the selected time-frame for their important findings or historical perspectives. Currently, there are no Class I recommendations from the American Heart Association (AHA) for the use of OM3, however, considering the safety of this therapy and beneficial findings of some modern studies (including patients with current maximal medical therapy for CVD), the AHA has recently expanded their list of Class II recommendations, in which treatment with OM3 for CVD benefit is reasonable. This review discusses the current state of the evidence, summarizes current professional recommendations, and provides recommendations for future research.

### Conclusions and recommendations from the symposium, beyond cholesterol: prevention and treatment of coronary heart disease with n-3 fatty acids [^115cSNCs]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2008). Low credibility.

After the symposium "Beyond Cholesterol: Prevention and Treatment of Coronary Heart Disease with n-3 Fatty Acids", faculty who presented at the conference submitted manuscripts relating to their conference topics, and these are presented in this supplement. The content of these manuscripts was reviewed, and 2 conference calls were convened. The objective was to summarize existing evidence, gaps in evidence, and future research needed to strengthen recommendations for specific intakes of n-3 fatty acids for different conditions relating to cardiovascular disease. The following 2 questions were the main items discussed. What are the roles of n-3 fatty acids in primary versus secondary prevention of coronary heart disease? What are the roles of n-3 fatty acids in hypertriglyceridemia, in the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, and in sudden cardiac death, cardiac arrhythmias, and vulnerable plaque? Each area was summarized by using 2 general categories: 1) current knowledge for which general consensus exists, and 2) recommendations for research and policy. Additional references for these conclusions can be found in the articles included in the supplement.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^111TbZAw]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Researchers have suggested that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from oily fish (long-chain omega-3 (LCn3), including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)), as well as from plants (alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)) benefit cardiovascular health. Guidelines recommend increasing omega-3-rich foods, and sometimes supplementation, but recent trials have not confirmed this.

Objectives

To assess effects of increased intake of fish- and plant-based omega-3 for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular (CVD) events, adiposity and lipids.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase to April 2017, plus ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry to September 2016, with no language restrictions. We handsearched systematic review references and bibliographies and contacted authors.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that lasted at least 12 months and compared supplementation and/or advice to increase LCn3 or ALA intake versus usual or lower intake.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion, extracted data and assessed validity. We performed separate random-effects meta-analysis for ALA and LCn3 interventions, and assessed dose-response relationships through meta-regression.

Main Results

We included 79 RCTs (112,059 participants) in this review update and found that 25 were at low summary risk of bias. Trials were of 12 to 72 months' duration and included adults at varying cardiovascular risk, mainly in high-income countries. Most studies assessed LCn3 supplementation with capsules, but some used LCn3- or ALA-rich or enriched foods or dietary advice compared to placebo or usual diet. Meta-analysis and sensitivity analyses suggested little or no effect of increasing LCn3 on all-cause mortality (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.03, 92,653 participants; 8189 deaths in 39 trials, high-quality evidence), cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.03, 67,772 participants; 4544 CVD deaths in 25 RCTs), cardiovascular events (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.04, 90,378 participants; 14,737 people experienced events in 38 trials, high-quality evidence), coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.09, 73,491 participants; 1596 CHD deaths in 21 RCTs), stroke (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.16, 89,358 participants; 1822 strokes in 28 trials) or arrhythmia (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.05, 53,796 participants; 3788 people experienced arrhythmia in 28 RCTs). There was a suggestion that LCn3 reduced CHD events (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88 to 0.97, 84,301 participants; 5469 people experienced CHD events in 28 RCTs); however, this was not maintained in sensitivity analyses - LCn3 probably makes little or no difference to CHD event risk. All evidence was of moderate GRADE quality, except as noted. Increasing ALA intake probably makes little or no difference to all-cause mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.20, 19,327 participants; 459 deaths, 5 RCTs), cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.25, 18,619 participants; 219 cardiovascular deaths, 4 RCTs), and it may make little or no difference to CHD events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.22, 19,061 participants, 397 CHD events, 4 RCTs, low-quality evidence). However, increased ALA may slightly reduce risk of cardiovascular events (from 4.8% to 4.7%, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.07, 19,327 participants; 884 CVD events, 5 RCTs, low-quality evidence), and probably reduces risk of CHD mortality (1.1% to 1.0%, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.26, 18,353 participants; 193 CHD deaths, 3 RCTs), and arrhythmia (3.3% to 2.6%, RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.10, 4,837 participants; 141 events, 1 RCT). Effects on stroke are unclear. Sensitivity analysis retaining only trials at low summary risk of bias moved effect sizes towards the null (RR 1.0) for all LCn3 primary outcomes except arrhythmias, but for most ALA outcomes, effect sizes moved to suggest protection. LCn3 funnel plots suggested that adding in missing studies/results would move effect sizes towards null for most primary outcomes. There were no dose or duration effects in subgrouping or meta-regression. There was no evidence that increasing LCn3 or ALA altered serious adverse events, adiposity or lipids, although LCn3 slightly reduced triglycerides and increased HDL. ALA probably reduces HDL (high- or moderate-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This is the most extensive systematic assessment of effects of omega-3 fats on cardiovascular health to date. Moderate- and high-quality evidence suggests that increasing EPA and DHA has little or no effect on mortality or cardiovascular health (evidence mainly from supplement trials). Previous suggestions of benefits from EPA and DHA supplements appear to spring from trials with higher risk of bias. Low-quality evidence suggests ALA may slightly reduce CVD event risk, CHD mortality and arrhythmia.

### Dietary fat and cardiometabolic health: evidence, controversies, and consensus for guidance [^114wZdFL]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

Box 4
Role of omega 6 and omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in health

Both omega 6 and omega 3 are essential fatty acids and are intrinsic to cell membranes and the structure of the central nervous system. They are precursors of eicosanoids, which are involved in inflammation, cardiac rhythm, thrombosis, vascular function, and many other processes. Evidence suggests, but is inconsistent, that adequate intake of omega 3 fatty acids reduces cardiac arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Concerns have been raised that omega 6 polyunsaturated fats are pro-inflammatory but this is not supported by controlled feeding studies and large cross sectional observations. In a follow-up study of over 128 000 men and women for up to 32 years, higher intake of linoleic acid (the most abundant omega 6 fatty acid) was associated with lower risks of coronary heart disease, cancer, and total mortality. The inverse association between linoleic acid intake and risk of cardiovascular disease and overall death is approximately linear up to about 8% of energy, beyond which data are lacking. Notably, linoleic acid levels in blood, a direct marker of dietary intake, were inversely associated, with the incidence of type 2 diabetes in prospective studies but arachidonic acid was not. In contrast, blood omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids were modestly inversely associated with coronary heart diseasebut the association with type 2 diabetes varied by subtype: plant origin omega 3 fatty acid (alpha linolenic acid) was inversely associated while marine origin omega 3 fatty acids were not.

Although authorities still disagree, most consider that public health decisions should be made on the weight of the available evidence, acknowledging its limitations, and seeking to obtain further, better evidence when indicated. Equally important is to acknowledge when evidence is insufficient to formulate any guidance, in which case all the relevant options should be clearly outlined to enable informed choice.

Key messages

For cardiovascular health, substantial evidence supports the importance of the type of fat consumed, not total fat intake, and the elimination of industrially produced trans fats
Much of the evidence suggests that the risk of coronary heart disease is reduced by replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fats (including plant oils) but not when carbohydrate is the replacement nutrient
Controversies remain about long term health effects of specific plant oils and of high fat, low carbohydrate diets, and research is needed to resolve these
The focus of dietary advice must be on the consumption of foods and overall dietary patterns, not on single nutrients

### Omega-3 fatty acids and coronary heart disease risk: clinical and mechanistic perspectives [^112a6peu]. Atherosclerosis (2008). Low credibility.

The most common omega-3 fatty acids contain 18–22 carbons and a signature double bond at the third position from the methyl (or n, or omega) end of the molecule. These fatty acids must be obtained in the diet as they cannot be synthesized by vertebrates. They include the plant-derived alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, 18:3n-3), and the fish-oil-derived eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n-3) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3). Normally, very little ALA is converted to EPA, and even less to DHA, and therefore direct intake of the latter two is optimal. EPA and DHA and their metabolites have important biologic functions, including effects on membranes, eicosanoid metabolism, and gene transcription. Studies indicate that the use of fish oil is associated with coronary heart disease risk reduction. A number of mechanisms may be responsible for such effects. These include prevention of arrhythmias as well as lowering heart rate and blood pressure, decreasing platelet aggregation, and lowering triglyceride levels. The latter is accomplished by decreasing the production of hepatic triglycerides and increasing the clearance of plasma triglycerides. Our focus is to review the potential mechanisms by which these fatty acids reduce cardiovascular disease risk.

### Associations of omega-3 fatty acid supplement use with cardiovascular disease risks: meta-analysis of 10 trials involving 77 917 individuals [^111q8QqR]. JAMA Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Key Points

Question

Does supplementation with marine-derived omega-3 fatty acids have any associations with reductions in fatal or nonfatal coronary heart disease in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease?

Findings

This meta-analysis of 10 trials involving 77 917 participants demonstrated that supplementation with marine-derived omega-3 fatty acids for a mean of 4.4 years had no significant association with reductions in fatal or nonfatal coronary heart disease or any major vascular events.

Meaning

The results provide no support for current recommendations to use omega-3 fatty acid supplements for the prevention of fatal coronary heart disease or any cardiovascular disease in people who have or at high risk of developing cardiovascular disease.

### Cardiovascular impact of nutritional supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids: JACC focus seminar [^112Qxhq7]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are a key component of a heart-healthy diet. For patients without clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, 2 or more servings of fatty fish per week is recommended to obtain adequate intake of omega-3 PUFAs. If this not possible, dietary supplementation with an appropriate fish oil may be reasonable. Supplementation with omega-3 PUFA capsules serves 2 distinct but overlapping roles: treatment of hypertriglyceridemia and prevention of cardiovascular events. Marine-derived omega-3 PUFAs reduce triglycerides and have pleiotropic effects including decreasing inflammation, improving plaque composition and stability, and altering cellular membranes. Clinical trial data have shown inconsistent results with omega-3 PUFAs improving cardiovascular outcomes. In this paper, the authors provide an overview of PUFAs and a summary of key clinical trial data. Recent trial data suggest the use of prescription eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease event reduction in selected populations.

### Heart failure (HF) guideline (2017) [^1111S7yN]. AND (2017). Medium credibility.

Heart failure (HF) guideline — omega-3 fatty acid supplementation clinical questions are outlined, asking: in patients with heart failure (NYHA Classes I - IV/AHA Stages B and C), what is the effect of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation on quality of life, signs & symptoms; and, in patients with advanced heart failure (NYHA Class IV/AHA Stage D), what is the effect on quality measures (re-admissions rate, length of stay, mortality), on quality of life, signs and symptoms, and on renal function labs and clinical labs.

### New insights into the health effects of dietary saturated and omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids [^115NLBfH]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

These data should help identify the optimal dietary fatty acid profile to reduce the risk and the complications of CVD. Thus, maintaining high or increasing - as proposed by certain experts - the intake of omega-6 in lieu of SFAs is definitely not the optimal strategy to prevent CVD complications.

### Heart failure (HF) guideline (2017) [^111YdYiS]. AND (2017). Medium credibility.

Omega-3 fatty acids — omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation is reasonable to use as adjunctive therapy in patients with NYHA class II–IV symptoms and HFrEF (heart failure reduced ejection fraction) or HFpEF (heart failure preserved ejection fraction), unless contraindicated, to reduce mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations, designated as Class IIa with Level of Evidence: B.

### Omega-3 fatty acids for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^1132gu2K]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from oily fish (long-chain omega-3 (LCn3)), including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)), as well as from plants (alpha-linolenic acid (ALA)) may benefit cardiovascular health. Guidelines recommend increasing omega-3-rich foods, and sometimes supplementation, but recent trials have not confirmed this.

Objectives

To assess the effects of increased intake of fish- and plant-based omega-3 fats for all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, adiposity and lipids.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase to February 2019, plus ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry to August 2019, with no language restrictions. We handsearched systematic review references and bibliographies and contacted trial authors.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that lasted at least 12 months and compared supplementation or advice to increase LCn3 or ALA intake, or both, versus usual or lower intake.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed validity. We performed separate random-effects meta-analysis for ALA and LCn3 interventions, and assessed dose-response relationships through meta-regression.

Main Results

We included 86 RCTs (162,796 participants) in this review update and found that 28 were at low summary risk of bias. Trials were of 12 to 88 months' duration and included adults at varying cardiovascular risk, mainly in high-income countries. Most trials assessed LCn3 supplementation with capsules, but some used LCn3- or ALA-rich or enriched foods or dietary advice compared to placebo or usual diet. LCn3 doses ranged from 0.5 g a day to more than 5 g a day (19 RCTs gave at least 3 g LCn3 daily). Meta-analysis and sensitivity analyses suggested little or no effect of increasing LCn3 on all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.97, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.93 to 1.01; 143,693 participants; 11,297 deaths in 45 RCTs; high-certainty evidence), cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86 to 0.99; 117,837 participants; 5658 deaths in 29 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence), cardiovascular events (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.01; 140,482 participants; 17,619 people experienced events in 43 RCTs; high-certainty evidence), stroke (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.12; 138,888 participants; 2850 strokes in 31 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence) or arrhythmia (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.06; 77,990 participants; 4586 people experienced arrhythmia in 30 RCTs; low-certainty evidence). Increasing LCn3 may slightly reduce coronary heart disease mortality (number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) 334, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.00; 127,378 participants; 3598 coronary heart disease deaths in 24 RCTs, low-certainty evidence) and coronary heart disease events (NNTB 167, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.85 to 0.97; 134,116 participants; 8791 people experienced coronary heart disease events in 32 RCTs, low-certainty evidence). Overall, effects did not differ by trial duration or LCn3 dose in pre-planned subgrouping or meta-regression. There is little evidence of effects of eating fish. Increasing ALA intake probably makes little or no difference to all-cause mortality (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.20; 19,327 participants; 459 deaths in 5 RCTs, moderate-certainty evidence), cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.25; 18,619 participants; 219 cardiovascular deaths in 4 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence), coronary heart disease mortality (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.26; 18,353 participants; 193 coronary heart disease deaths in 3 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence) and coronary heart disease events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.22; 19,061 participants; 397 coronary heart disease events in 4 RCTs; low-certainty evidence). However, increased ALA may slightly reduce risk of cardiovascular disease events (NNTB 500, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.07; but RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.04 in RCTs at low summary risk of bias; 19,327 participants; 884 cardiovascular disease events in 5 RCTs; low-certainty evidence), and probably slightly reduces risk of arrhythmia (NNTB 91, RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.97; 4912 participants; 173 events in 2 RCTs; moderate-certainty evidence). Effects on stroke are unclear. Increasing LCn3 and ALA had little or no effect on serious adverse events, adiposity, lipids and blood pressure, except increasing LCn3 reduced triglycerides by ˜15% in a dose-dependent way (high-certainty evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This is the most extensive systematic assessment of effects of omega-3 fats on cardiovascular health to date. Moderate- and low-certainty evidence suggests that increasing LCn3 slightly reduces risk of coronary heart disease mortality and events, and reduces serum triglycerides (evidence mainly from supplement trials). Increasing ALA slightly reduces risk of cardiovascular events and arrhythmia.

### Effect of omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation on heart rate: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^1171F4kq]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

The present meta-analysis provides strong and updated clinical evidence demonstrating the effect of heart rate reduction by n−3 LCPUFA supplementation. In analyzing trials with DHA or EPA alone, our study demonstrates that DHA rather than EPA is more ascribable to such chronotropic effect. Future investigations may evaluate whether heart rate reduction with n−3 LCPUFAs in general and with DHA in specific is associated with improved outcomes in clinical patients or with better health profile of the public.

### Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (fish oil) supplementation and the prevention of clinical cardiovascular disease: a science advisory from the American Heart Association [^116eY41h]. Circulation (2017). Low credibility.

Multiple randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have assessed the effects of supplementation with eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid (omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, commonly called fish oils) on the occurrence of clinical cardiovascular diseases. Although the effects of supplementation for the primary prevention of clinical cardiovascular events in the general population have not been examined, RCTs have assessed the role of supplementation in secondary prevention among patients with diabetes mellitus and prediabetes, patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease, and those with prevalent coronary heart disease. In this scientific advisory, we take a clinical approach and focus on common indications for omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplements related to the prevention of clinical cardiovascular events. We limited the scope of our review to large RCTs of supplementation with major clinical cardiovascular disease end points; meta-analyses were considered secondarily. We discuss the features of available RCTs and provide the rationale for our recommendations. We then use existing American Heart Association criteria to assess the strength of the recommendation and the level of evidence. On the basis of our review of the cumulative evidence from RCTs designed to assess the effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation on clinical cardiovascular events, we update prior recommendations for patients with prevalent coronary heart disease, and we offer recommendations, when data are available, for patients with other clinical indications, including patients with diabetes mellitus and prediabetes and those with high risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation.

### Effect of omega-3 fatty acids on cardiovascular outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1144J5ig]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we noted moderate certainty of evidence favoring omega-3 FAs for reducing cardiovascular mortality and outcomes. The magnitude of relative reductions was robust in EPA trials vs. those of EPA+DHA, suggesting differential effects of EPA and DHA in cardiovascular risk reduction. These findings also have important implications for clinical practice and treatment guidelines. After REDUCE-IT, several national and international guidelines endorsed EPA in their therapeutic recommendations. However, the publication of two recent negative trials of EPA + DHA has created some confusion in the scientific community about the value of omega-3 FAs in preventing ASCVD events. This meta-analysis provides reassurance about the role of omega-3 FAs, specifically EPA, in the current treatment framework of ASCVD residual cardiovascular risk reduction and encourages investigators to explore further the cardiovascular effects of EPA across different clinical settings.

Omega-3 fatty acids for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) — trial and meta-analysis evidence: Harris et al. noted 9 large randomized trials of omega-3 fatty acid supplements, with 4 positive, 4 neutral, and 1 negative; positive trials (1980s to early 2000s) used EPA and DHA intakes between 0.85 and 1.8 g/day, whereas neutral trials (2010–2012) provided 376 to 840 mg/day of EPA and DHA. Evidence syntheses include five systematic reviews and meta-analyses; two published before 2010 reported benefits in existing CHD, but three published after 2010 did not report benefits. A frequently cited meta-analysis (Rizos et al.) was criticized for using a significance threshold of 0.006 instead of 0.05; without this maneuver, fish oil supplementation significantly reduced risk for cardiac death by 9% [RR 0.91; 95% CI 0.85–0.98; p = 0.011].

### Recent findings on the health effects of omega-3 fatty acids and statins, and their interactions: do statins inhibit omega-3? [^114218TS]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

If we only consider RCTs reporting 'hard' (myocardial infarction and cardiac death) endpoints, with sample size and follow-up large enough to analyze mortality, three RCTs should be examined.

In a first RCT (Sufolom3), 2,501 CHD patients were randomized to receive either 0.6 g/day of EPA+DHA or placebo and were followed up for 4.7 years. About 85% of patients were taking a statin. Baseline plasma n-3 levels were high, indicating that most patients were not n-3 deficient. For instance, plasma EPA at baseline (1.20% of total fatty acids) was higher than the level measured in the experimental group of the Lyon Trial (1.03 ± 0.06 vs. 0.76 ± 0.05% in the control group) receiving n-3 supplementation. In Sufolom3, allocation to n-3 was not associated with any significant benefit. A limitation of the trial was the low complication rate (1.3% per year) compared, for instance, with 4.9% in the Lyon trial.

### Ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid biomarkers and coronary heart disease: pooling project of 19 cohort studies [^1134TBoR]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Importance

The role of ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) remains controversial. Most prior longitudinal studies evaluated self-reported consumption rather than biomarkers.

Objective

To evaluate biomarkers of seafood-derived eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5ω-3), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA; 22:5ω-3), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6ω-3) and plant-derived α-linolenic acid (ALA; 18:3ω-3) for incident CHD.

Data Sources

A global consortium of 19 studies identified by November 2014.

Study Selection

Available prospective (cohort, nested case-control) or retrospective studies with circulating or tissue ω-3 biomarkers and ascertained CHD.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Each study conducted standardized, individual-level analysis using harmonized models, exposures, outcomes, and covariates. Findings were centrally pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was examined by age, sex, race, diabetes, statins, aspirin, ω-6 levels, and FADS desaturase genes.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Incident total CHD, fatal CHD, and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI).

Results

The 19 studies comprised 16 countries, 45 637 unique individuals, and 7973 total CHD, 2781 fatal CHD, and 7157 nonfatal MI events, with ω-3 measures in total plasma, phospholipids, cholesterol esters, and adipose tissue. Median age at baseline was 59 years (range, 18–97 years), and 28 660 (62.8%) were male. In continuous (per 1-SD increase) multivariable-adjusted analyses, the ω-3 biomarkers ALA, DPA, and DHA were associated with a lower risk of fatal CHD, with relative risks (RRs) of 0.91 (95% CI, 0.84–0.98) for ALA, 0.90 (95% CI, 0.85–0.96) for DPA, and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.84–0.96) for DHA. Although DPA was associated with a lower risk of total CHD (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.90–0.99), ALA (RR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.95–1.05), EPA (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.87–1.02), and DHA (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.91–1.00) were not. Significant associations with nonfatal MI were not evident. Associations appeared generally stronger in phospholipids and total plasma. Restricted cubic splines did not identify evidence of nonlinearity in dose responses.

Conclusions and Relevance

On the basis of available studies of free-living populations globally, biomarker concentrations of seafood and plant-derived ω-3 fatty acids are associated with a modestly lower incidence of fatal CHD.

### Polyunsaturated fatty acids for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^111cvrkE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence on the health effects of total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) is equivocal. Fish oils are rich in omega-3 PUFA and plant oils in omega-6 PUFA. Evidence suggests that increasing PUFA-rich foods, supplements or supplemented foods can reduce serum cholesterol, but may increase body weight, so overall cardiovascular effects are unclear.

Objectives

To assess effects of increasing total PUFA intake on cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality, lipids and adiposity in adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase to April 2017 and clinicaltrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to September 2016, without language restrictions. We checked trials included in relevant systematic reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing higher with lower PUFA intakes in adults with or without cardiovascular disease that assessed effects over 12 months or longer. We included full texts, abstracts, trials registry entries and unpublished data. Outcomes were all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease mortality and events, risk factors (blood lipids, adiposity, blood pressure), and adverse events. We excluded trials where we could not separate effects of PUFA intake from other dietary, lifestyle or medication interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently screened titles and abstracts, assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. We wrote to authors of included trials for further data. Meta-analyses used random-effects analysis, sensitivity analyses included fixed-effects and limiting to low summary risk of bias. We assessed GRADE quality of evidence.

Main Results

We included 49 RCTs randomising 24,272 participants, with duration of one to eight years. Eleven included trials were at low summary risk of bias, 33 recruited participants without cardiovascular disease. Baseline PUFA intake was unclear in most trials, but 3.9% to 8% of total energy intake where reported. Most trials gave supplemental capsules, but eight gave dietary advice, eight gave supplemental foods such as nuts or margarine, and three used a combination of methods to increase PUFA. Increasing PUFA intake probably has little or no effect on all-cause mortality (risk 7.8% vs 7.6%, risk ratio (RR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.07, 19,290 participants in 24 trials), but probably slightly reduces risk of coronary heart disease events from 14.2% to 12.3% (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.06, 15 trials, 10,076 participants) and cardiovascular disease events from 14.6% to 13.0% (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.01, 17,799 participants in 21 trials), all moderate-quality evidence. Increasing PUFA may slightly reduce risk of coronary heart disease death (6.6% to 6.1%, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.06, 9 trials, 8810 participants) andstroke (1.2% to 1.1%, RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.44, 11 trials, 14,742 participants, though confidence intervals include important harms), but has little or no effect on cardiovascular mortality (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.26, 16 trials, 15,107 participants) all low-quality evidence. Effects of increasing PUFA on major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events and atrial fibrillation are unclear as evidence is of very low quality. Increasing PUFA intake probably slightly decreases triglycerides (by 15%, MD -0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.04, 20 trials, 3905 participants), but has little or no effect on total cholesterol (mean difference (MD) -0.12 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.23 to -0.02, 26 trials, 8072 participants), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (MD -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.01, 18 trials, 4674 participants) or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (MD -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.06, 15 trials, 3362 participants). Increasing PUFA probably has little or no effect on adiposity (body weight MD 0.76 kg, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.19, 12 trials, 7100 participants). Effects of increasing PUFA on serious adverse events such as pulmonary embolism and bleeding are unclear as the evidence is of very low quality.

Authors' Conclusions

This is the most extensive systematic review of RCTs conducted to date to assess effects of increasing PUFA on cardiovascular disease, mortality, lipids or adiposity. Increasing PUFA intake probably slightly reduces risk of coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease events, may slightly reduce risk of coronary heart disease mortality and stroke (though not ruling out harms), but has little or no effect on all-cause or cardiovascular disease mortality. The mechanism may be via TG reduction.

### Effect of omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation on heart rate: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^113ZQ5Fw]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Methods

Search strategy

This present meta-analysis was planned, conducted, and reported in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses guidelines (PRISMA). PubMed and Cochrane databases were searched for relevant articles examining the effects of n−3 LCPUFAs on HR through May 2017. The following search terms were employed to identify relevant articles in the databases: (omega 3 fatty acids OR omega 3 OR polyunsaturated fatty acids OR PUFA OR fish oil OR marine oil OR eicosapentaenoic acid OR EPA OR docosahexaenoic acid OR DHA) AND (heart rate OR HR OR pulse). The search strategy had no restriction on language, publication date, or article type. The reference lists of the previous meta-analyses were reviewed to complement the database searches. Additionally, we also attempt to contact the authors of the original studies for unreported HR data.

Selection and inclusion of RCTs

The studies eligible for inclusion in this meta-analysis had to meet the following inclusion criteria: (1) RCTs lasted at least 2 weeks; (2) one or more intervention groups received n−3 LCPUFA supplementation (i.e. fish oil (EPA plus DHA), purified EPA, purified DHA) or food containing n−3 LCPUFAs (i.e. fatty fish) and being compared with placebo; (3) trials reported effects on HR; and (4) the mean age of participants was ≥ 18 years.

Data extraction and assessment of bias

Using a standardized data collection form, the following study characteristics were abstracted from each study: (1) first author's last name, year of publication; (2) participant characteristics including the mean age, sex, and health status; (3) trial characteristics including the trial design, number of participants in intervention or control groups, total dose of EPA plus DHA, ratio of EPA to DHA, trial duration, type of control, dropout rate, and blinding; and (4) methods of HR assessment. Cochrane tool for assessing the risk of bias was used to evaluate the risk of bias among the included studies (Supplementary Table S1). Two authors (KH and JY) independently performed the database search, data extraction, and quality assessment. Any discrepancies regarding inclusion were resolved by group discussion.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^112SkJaw]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

Omega-3 fatty acids — heart failure outcomes are summarized as follows: EPA and DHA supplementation in patients with ejection fractions < 40% versus > 50% produced a 58% reduction vs 11% reduction in sudden cardiac death (P = 0.0003). In the GISSI-Heart Failure Trial, functional Class II to IV patients randomized to 1 g/day of EPA and DHA ethyl esters for 3.9 years had an absolute 9% reduction in mortality or hospital admission (P = 0.04). Additional data reported that in 100 heart failure patients, treatment with 1 g/day omega-3 fatty acid supplements was associated with prevention of 1.8 deaths and 1.7 cardiovascular hospitalizations, and The National Heart Foundation of Australia concluded there is modest support for 1 g/day of omega-3 PUFA in addition to standard therapy.

### Recent findings on the health effects of omega-3 fatty acids and statins, and their interactions: do statins inhibit omega-3? [^113rgZ1p]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Early randomized controlled trials (RCTs) demonstrated the health benefits of omega-3 fatty acids (n-3), whereas recent RCTs were negative. We now address the issue, focusing on the temporal changes having occurred: most patients in recent RCTs are no longer n-3 deficient and the vast majority are now treated with statins. Recent RCTs testing n-3 against arrhythmias suggest that n-3 reduce the risk only in patients not taking a statin. Other recent RCTs in secondary prevention were negative although, in a post-hoc analysis separating statin users and non-users, non-significant protection of n-3 was observed among statin non-users whereas statin users had no effect. Recent RCTs testing statins - after the implementation of the New Clinical Trial Regulation in 2007 - are negative (or flawed) suggesting that the lack of effect of n-3 cannot be attributed to a parallel protection by statins. Finally, statins favor the metabolism of omega-6 fatty acids (n-6), which in turn inhibits n-3 and, contrary to n-3, they increase insulin resistance and the risk of diabetes. Thus, n-3 and statins are counteractive at several levels and statins appear to inhibit n-3.

### Cardiovascular effects of omega-3 fatty acids: hope or hype? [^113Rfxyp]. Atherosclerosis (2021). Medium credibility.

Omega-3 fatty acids have emerged as a new option for controlling the residual risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the statin era after a clinical trial (REDUCE-IT) reported positive results with icosapent ethyl (IPE) in patients receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy. However, another trial which used high dose eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) combination (STRENGTH) has failed. Together, these results raise clinically important questions. Are effects of omega-3 fatty acids neutral or beneficial in patients on statin therapy, or perhaps even harmful? The current contradictory results could be attributed to different types of omega-3 fatty acids (only EPA or combination of EPA + DHA), doses (higher vs. lower dose) of omega-3 fatty acids or different comparators (corn oil or mineral oil), as well as the underlying severity of the CVD risk or use of statins. Together with these issues, we will discuss different biological and clinical effects of various types of omega-3 fatty acids and then interpret different results of past and current clinical studies and propose practical suggestions, which could be applied in patient management.

### Associations of omega-3 fatty acid supplement use with cardiovascular disease risks: meta-analysis of 10 trials involving 77 917 individuals [^113QkRLo]. JAMA Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The 2016 European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines for prevention of cardiovascular diseaseindicated that it is debatable whether omega-3 FAs may exert a protective effect, and the 2016 guidelines on the management of dyslipidaemiaindicated that more evidence on the efficacy of omega-3 FA supplements for prevention of clinical outcomes is needed to justify their prescription. In contrast, the American Heart Association recommendedthat the use of omega-3 FAs for prevention of CHD is probably justified in individuals with prior CHD and those with heart failure and reduced ejection fractions. However, the results of the present meta-analysis provide no support for the recommendations to use approximately 1 g/d of omega-3 FAs in individuals with a history of CHD for the prevention of fatal CHD, nonfatal MI, or any other vascular events. The results of the ongoing trials are needed to assess if higher doses of omega-3 FAs (3–4 g/d) may have significant effects on risk of major vascular events.

### Recent findings on the health effects of omega-3 fatty acids and statins, and their interactions: do statins inhibit omega-3? [^112QSU1b]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Until 2005, studies consistently provided clear evidence that omega-3 fatty acids (n-3) protect against cardiovascular diseases (CVD) complications. They were thought to reduce the risk of arterial atherosclerotic and thrombotic obstruction; to increase the myocardial resistance to ischemia-reperfusion injury; and to prevent malignant ventricular arrhythmias. Animal and epidemiological studies as well as randomized controlled trials (RCTs) all supported that n-3 are protective. This was confirmed in meta-analyses of both prospective cohort studies and RCTs leading to the conclusion that an intake of 250 mg/day of marine n-3 (EPA+DHA (eicosapentanoic acid + docosahexanoic acid)) reduced fatal CVD by 36% when compared to no EPA+DHA.

Consequently, it was proposed to use blood measurements of n-3 as a predictor of CVD complications. The omega-3 index - defined as the percentage of EPA+DHA in blood red cells - reflects the average dietary intake and the tissue levels of EPA+DHA, including those of the heart. A high omega-3 index (> 8%) is thought to be associated with a low risk of CVD complications whereas a low omega-3 index (< 4%) is associated with increased risk susceptible to be decreased by a preventive treatment with n-3 (fish oil) supplements. An omega-3 index between 4 and 8% indicates an intermediate risk. The effects of n-3 supplements are, therefore, expected to be different in patients with either high or low omega-3 index with large benefits for those with a low index (that is, high risk) and small or no benefits for those with a high index (that is, low risk). This concept is critical because it suggests that n-3 supplements might be potentially protective against CVD complications only in patients who are n-3 deficient and not in patients who are at high risk for reasons other than an n-3 deficiency. This underlines the fact that n-3 are nutrients and not a drug. So far this concept applies only for CVD, not for other nonvascular and non-cardiac clinical conditions.

### Seafood long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and cardiovascular disease: a science advisory from the American Heart Association [^116WyyRb]. Circulation (2018). Low credibility.

Since the 2002 American Heart Association scientific statement "Fish Consumption, Fish Oil, Omega-3 Fatty Acids, and Cardiovascular Disease", evidence from observational and experimental studies and from randomized controlled trials continues to emerge to further substantiate the beneficial effects of seafood long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and cardiovascular disease. A recent American Heart Association science advisory addressed the specific effect of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation on clinical cardiovascular events. This American Heart Association science advisory extends that review and offers further support to include n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from seafood consumption. Several potential mechanisms have been investigated, including antiarrhythmic, anti-inflammatory, hematologic, and endothelial, although for most, longer-term dietary trials of seafood are warranted to substantiate the benefit of seafood as a replacement for other important sources of macronutrients. The present science advisory reviews this evidence and makes a suggestion in the context of the 2015–2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans and in consideration of other constituents of seafood and the impact on sustainability. We conclude that 1 to 2 seafood meals per week be included to reduce the risk of congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, ischemic stroke, and sudden cardiac death, especially when seafood replaces the intake of less healthy foods.

### Recent findings on the health effects of omega-3 fatty acids and statins, and their interactions: do statins inhibit omega-3? [^111rhyEA]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Thus, in the first category, we have retained three RCTs.

The first one was published in June 2005 and reported no significant effect of 1.3 g/day of EPA+DHA. The omega-3 index of patients receiving EPA+DHA increased from 4.7 to 8.3% indicating that patients were not n-3 deficient at baseline and were compliant during the follow-up. About half of the patients in both groups were taking a statin. Limitations of the trial were the small sample size (n = 100 per group) and clinical heterogeneity - ischemic vs. non ischemic heart disease - of the underlying cardiac diseases. The second trial was published in November 2005 and reported a non-significant effect (28% risk reduction, P = 0.057 in the intention-to-treat analysis) of 2.6 g/day of EPA+DHA. Interestingly, the effect was significant among patients with ischemic heart disease (hazard ratio 0.70, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.00) and also, no patient was taking a statin in either group. The omega-3 index increased from 3.4 to 7.6% in the EPA+DHA group indicating that these patients were slightly n-3 deficient at baseline and compliant. A major limitation was the short follow-up (12 months). The third trial was published in June 2006 and reported no significant effect of 0.96 g/day of EPA+DHA (20). Only 45% of the patients were taking a statin. The short follow-up (12 months) was the main limitation of the study. Measurements of plasma EPA indicated that patients were not n-3 deficient at baseline and were then compliant. There was no protective effect of EPA+DHA in the primary analysis, but a non-significant trend toward protection in the EPA+DHA group among patients with ischemic heart disease: hazard ratio 0.76, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.11.

### Is there a role for omega-3 fatty acids in cardiovascular disease risk reduction? [^114UDXFs]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

A recent meta-analysis published in EClinicalMedicine examined the effectiveness of omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), on cardiovascular (CV) outcomes. Mixed EPA/DHA formulations were indicated to have moderate certainty in reducing CV mortality and outcomes. Greater relative reductions in incident CV events were observed with EPA alone trials. The authors conclude that EPA and DHA have inherently different physico-chemical properties that influence CV risk reduction.

Our concern is that the authors assert mixed EPA/DHA formulations remain a viable treatment to reduce CV risk in patients using contemporary care. This conclusion is derived from a meta-analysis disproportinately influenced by older trials conducted without broad statin use. In particular, the large GISSI-P and GISSI-HF trials enrolled subjects with 5% and 23% on statins, respectively (Table 1). By contrast, STRENGTH tested an EPA/DHA formulation (4 g/d) in patients on maximum statin treatment and terminated early for futility. Similarly, the OMEMI trial failed to meet its primary endpoint when EPA/DHA (1.8 g/d) was combined with high statin use (Table). Like other TG-lowering agents (e.g. fibrates, niacin), mixed EPA/DHA treatments do not add incremental benefit in risk reduction on top of statins. The benefits of icosapent ethyl (IPE) are attributed to dose, formulation and direct effects of EPA on inflammation, platelet activity and endothelial function beyond changes in lipoprotein levels.

Cardiovascular outcome trials with omega-3 fatty acids since 1999.

We recommend that the authors repeat the meta-analysis after removing older trials performed without broad statin use to ascertain a potential role for omega-3 fatty acids as part of contemporary medical therapy in CV patients.

### Marine omega-3 supplementation and cardiovascular disease: an updated meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials involving 127 477 participants [^113ZKZWq]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Whether marine or long‐chain omega‐3 fatty acid supplementation has significant benefits in reducing risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the subject of intense debate. Despite consistent findings from observational studies showing inverse associations between higher fish consumption and lower risk of heart disease, 1, 2 recent evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing marine omega‐3 supplementation, usually a moderate‐dose combination of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid compared with placebo, have had largely null results. 3, 4 Although the American Heart Association continues to recommend marine omega‐3 supplementation for patients with prevalent coronary heart disease to reduce mortality, it found insufficient evidence for use in prevention among patients at high CVD risk but without CVD. 5 A recent meta‐analysis synthesizing study‐level data from 10 midsize‐to‐large RCTs with at least 1 year of follow‐up reported no significant favorable effects of marine omega‐3 fatty acid supplementation on fatal or nonfatal coronary heart disease (CHD) or any major vascular events. 6 Another expanded meta‐analysis including smaller trials and dietary intervention trials reached the same conclusions. 7 Inconsistent findings between observational studies and RCTs cast doubt on a causal relationship between fish oil supplements and CVD prevention. 8

### Circulating fatty acids and risk of coronary heart disease and stroke: individual participant data meta-analysis in up to 16 126 participants [^112QuRQK]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Early interest in the relation of dietary fatty acids with cardiovascular disease emerged following results from ecological studies conducted between the 1950s and 1970s. These studies indicated that populations with high consumption of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) had increased rates of mortality from cardiovascular diseases, 1 while reduced cardiovascular disease mortality was observed in populations with high consumption of omega‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. 2, 3 Numerous subsequent controlled feeding studies showed that dietary fatty acid composition could modulate the concentration of the major circulating blood lipid fractions (mainly total, low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol and triacylglycerols). 4 These observations played a central role in the classical diet‐heart hypothesis and have prompted recommendations on dietary fatty acid intake for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. 5, 6, 7

In the past few decades, however, some long‐lasting beliefs concerning the effects of fatty acids on health have been challenged. For example, it has been argued that the effect of reduction of dietary SFAs on coronary heart disease (CHD) may depend on what dietary components they replace (carbohydrates or polyunsaturated fatty acids). 8 In addition, systematic reviews of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported heterogeneous results regarding the protective effect of omega‐3 fatty acids on cardiovascular outcomes with more recent trials failing to replicate initial positive findings. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 The reasons for inconsistent findings remain elusive, although several methodological issues may have contributed to heterogeneity in both RCTs and observational studies. In the case of omega‐3, a recent systematic review of RCTs that lasted at least 12 months (n = 112 059 participants) concluded that increasing omega‐3 intake has little or no effect on cardiovascular events or mortality and found no evidence of differential effects according to omega‐3 dose, trial duration, and primary or secondary prevention. 13 For other fatty acids, evidence is less convincing. 14 Furthermore, most studies have focused on CHD as the outcome; hence, the relevance of most fatty acids for cerebrovascular disease remains unclear.

### Effect of omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation on heart rate: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^116cAdUo]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated resting heart rate (HR) has emerged as a new risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. The effect of marine-derived omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 LCPUFAs) supplementation on HR was investigated as an outcome in many clinical trials. The present study was to provide an updated meta-analysis on the HR-slowing effect of n-3 LCPUFAs, and to differentiate the chronotropic effect between eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).

Methods

PubMed and Cochrane databases were searched for relevant articles examining the effects of n-3 PUFAs on HR through May 2017. A random-effects model was used to generate the pooled effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The pooled effect sizes were presented as weighted mean differences (WMDs).

Results

A total of 51 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with approximately 3000 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Compared to placebo, n-3 PUFA supplementation mildly but significantly reduced HR (-2.23 bpm; 95% CI: -3.07, -1.40 bpm). Moderate evidence of heterogeneity was observed among included trials (I 2 = 49.1%, P heterogeneity < 0.001). When DHA and EPA were separately administered, modest HR reduction was observed in trials that supplemented with DHA (-2.47 bpm; 95% CI: -3.47, -1.46 bpm), but not in trials with EPA.

Conclusions

The present meta-analysis provides strong clinical evidence demonstrating the effect of heart rate reduction by n-3 LCPUFA supplementation. When DHA or EPA administered alone, heart rate was slowed by DHA rather than by EPA.

### Effect of omega-3 fatty acids on cardiovascular outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1149iEXV]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The effects of omega-3 fatty acids (FAs), such as eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids, on cardiovascular outcomes are uncertain. We aimed to determine the effectiveness of omega-3 FAs on fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular outcomes and examine the potential variability in EPA vs. EPA+DHA treatment effects.

Methods

We searched EMBASE, PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane library databases through June 7, 2021. We performed a meta-analysis of 38 randomized controlled trials of omega-3 FAs, stratified by EPA monotherapy and EPA+DHA therapy. We estimated random-effects rate ratios (RRs) with (95% confidence intervals) and rated the certainty of evidence using GRADE. The key outcomes of interest were cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal cardiovascular outcomes, bleeding, and atrial fibrillation (AF). The protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42021227580).

Findings

In 149,051 participants, omega-3 FA was associated with reducing cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.93 [0.88–0.98]; p = 0.01), non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) (RR, 0.87 [0.81–0.93]; p = 0.0001), coronary heart disease events (CHD) (RR, 0.91 [0.87–0.96]; p = 0.0002), major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) (RR, 0.95 [0.92–0.98]; p = 0.002), and revascularization (RR, 0.91 [0.87–0.95]; p = 0.0001). The meta-analysis showed higher RR reductions with EPA monotherapy (0.82 [0.68–0.99]) than with EPA + DHA (0.94 [0.89–0.99]) for cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal MI (EPA: 0.72 [0.62–0.84]; EPA+DHA: 0.92 [0.85–1.00]), CHD events (EPA: 0.73 [0.62–0.85]; EPA+DHA: 0.94 [0.89–0.99]), as well for MACE and revascularization. Omega-3 FA increased incident AF (RR, 1.26 [1.08–1.48]). EPA monotherapy vs. control was associated with a higher risk of total bleeding (RR: 1.49 [1.20–1.84]) and AF (RR, 1.35 [1.10–1.66]).

Interpretation

Omega-3 FAs reduced cardiovascular mortality and improved cardiovascular outcomes. The cardiovascular risk reduction was more prominent with EPA monotherapy than with EPA+DHA.

Funding

None.

2.6 The certainty of the evidence

We evaluated the certainty of evidence using the grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE) approach (. Two experienced authors (S.U.K. and A.N.L.) rated each domain separately for each comparison, and any discrepancies were resolved by consensus. The certainty for each comparison and outcome was rated as high, moderate, low, or very low, based on considerations of risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision, indirectness, and other considerations (publication bias, large effect, plausible confounding, and dose-response gradient). The summary of the GRADE evidence chart is reported on Appendix p 7 and 8.

2.7 Role of the funding source

This study received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors. S. U. Khan and A. N. Lone accessed the data. S. U. Khan and D. L. Bhatt decided to submit for publication. All the co-authors agreed with the decision.

### Association between omega-3 fatty acid supplementation and risk of major cardiovascular disease events: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Sad8R]. JAMA (2012). Excellent credibility.

Context

Considerable controversy exists regarding the association of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and major cardiovascular end points.

Objective

To assess the role of omega-3 supplementation on major cardiovascular outcomes.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through August 2012.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials evaluating the effect of omega-3 on all-cause mortality, cardiac death, sudden death, myocardial infarction, and stroke.

Data Extraction

Descriptive and quantitative information was extracted; absolute and relative risk (RR) estimates were synthesized under a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using the Q statistic and I2. Subgroup analyses were performed for the presence of blinding, the prevention settings, and patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators, and meta-regression analyses were performed for the omega-3 dose. A statistical significance threshold of .0063 was assumed after adjustment for multiple comparisons.

Data Synthesis

Of the 3635 citations retrieved, 20 studies of 68,680 patients were included, reporting 7044 deaths, 3993 cardiac deaths, 1150 sudden deaths, 1837 myocardial infarctions, and 1490 strokes. No statistically significant association was observed with all-cause mortality (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.91 to 1.02; risk reduction [RD] -0.004, 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.02), cardiac death (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.85 to 0.98; RD, -0.01; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.00), sudden death (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.01; RD, -0.003; 95% CI, -0.012 to 0.006), myocardial infarction (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.04; RD, -0.002; 95% CI, -0.007 to 0.002), and stroke (RR, 1.05; 95% CI, 0.93 to 1.18; RD, 0.001; 95% CI, -0.002 to 0.004) when all supplement studies were considered.

Conclusion

Overall, omega-3 PUFA supplementation was not associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality, cardiac death, sudden death, myocardial infarction, or stroke based on relative and absolute measures of association.

### Effect of omega-3 fatty acids on cardiovascular outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114AX1nd]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

3 Results

We reviewed a total of 798 articles for eligibility after removing duplicates and screening at the title and abstract level. Further, 760 articles were removed based on a priori study selection criteria. Ultimately, 38 trials encompassing 149,051 patients were included (Fig. 1). The characteristics of the participants and trials are reported in Table 1. Of 38 trials, 4 trials compared EPA vs. control and 34 trials compared EPA+DHA vs. control. Twenty-two trials studied primary prevention. The dose of omega-3 FAs ranged from 0.4 g/day to 5.5 g/day. The EPA trials had dose ranges from 1.8 to 4.0 g/day and EPA+DHA from 0.4 to 5.5 g/day. The patients' mean age ranged from 39 to 78 years, and the proportion of enrolled women varied from 0% to 77.5%. The median follow-up duration across the trials was 2.0 years (IQR, 1–4.2).

### The omega-3 index: a new risk factor for death from coronary heart disease? [^1129ZZBQ]. Preventive Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Low intakes or blood levels of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids (EPA + DHA) are independently associated with increased risk of death from coronary heart disease (CHD). In randomized secondary prevention trials, fish or fish oil have been demonstrated to reduce total and CHD mortality at intakes of about 1 g/day. Red blood cell (RBC) fatty acid (FA) composition reflects long-term intake of EPA + DHA. We propose that the RBC EPA + DHA (hereafter called the Omega-3 Index) be considered a new risk factor for death from CHD.

Methods

We conducted clinical and laboratory experiments to generate data necessary for the validation of the Omega-3 Index as a CHD risk predictor. The relationship between this putative marker and risk for CHD death, especially sudden cardiac death (SCD), was then evaluated in several published primary and secondary prevention studies.

Results

The Omega-3 Index was inversely associated with risk for CHD mortality. An Omega-3 Index of ≥ 8% was associated with the greatest cardioprotection, whereas an index of ≤ 4% was associated with the least.

Conclusion

The Omega-3 Index may represent a novel, physiologically relevant, easily modified, independent, and graded risk factor for death from CHD that could have significant clinical utility.

### Associations of omega-3 fatty acid supplement use with cardiovascular disease risks: meta-analysis of 10 trials involving 77 917 individuals [^11121mVg]. JAMA Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

Importance

Current guidelines advocate the use of marine-derived omega-3 fatty acids supplements for the prevention of coronary heart disease and major vascular events in people with prior coronary heart disease, but large trials of omega-3 fatty acids have produced conflicting results.

Objective

To conduct a meta-analysis of all large trials assessing the associations of omega-3 fatty acid supplements with the risk of fatal and nonfatal coronary heart disease and major vascular events in the full study population and prespecified subgroups.

Data Sources and Study Selection

This meta-analysis included randomized trials that involved at least 500 participants and a treatment duration of at least 1 year and that assessed associations of omega-3 fatty acids with the risk of vascular events.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Aggregated study-level data were obtained from 10 large randomized clinical trials. Rate ratios for each trial were synthesized using observed minus expected statistics and variances. Summary rate ratios were estimated by a fixed-effects meta-analysis using 95% confidence intervals for major diseases and 99% confidence intervals for all subgroups.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The main outcomes included fatal coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, major vascular events, and all-cause mortality, as well as major vascular events in study population subgroups.

Results

Of the 77 917 high-risk individuals participating in the 10 trials, 47 803 (61.4%) were men, and the mean age at entry was 64.0 years; the trials lasted a mean of 4.4 years. The associations of treatment with outcomes were assessed on 6273 coronary heart disease events (2695 coronary heart disease deaths and 2276 nonfatal myocardial infarctions) and 12 001 major vascular events. Randomization to omega-3 fatty acid supplementation (eicosapentaenoic acid dose range, 226–1800 mg/d) had no significant associations with coronary heart disease death (rate ratio [RR], 0.93; 99% CI, 0.83–1.03; p = 0.05), nonfatal myocardial infarction (RR, 0.97; 99% CI, 0.87–1.08; p = 0.43) or any coronary heart disease events (RR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.90–1.01; p = 0.12). Neither did randomization to omega-3 fatty acid supplementation have any significant associations with major vascular events (RR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.93–1.01; p = 0.10), overall or in any subgroups, including subgroups composed of persons with prior coronary heart disease, diabetes, lipid levels greater than a given cutoff level, or statin use.

Conclusions and Relevance

This meta-analysis demonstrated that omega-3 fatty acids had no significant association with fatal or nonfatal coronary heart disease or any major vascular events. It provides no support for current recommendations for the use of such supplements in people with a history of coronary heart disease.

### 2022 AHA / ACC / HFSA guideline for the management of heart failure: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113vWvL2]. Circulation (2022). High credibility.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) evidence — Trials in prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including HF, showed that omega-3 PUFA supplementation results in a 10% to 20% risk reduction in fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events when used with other evidence-based therapies. In GISSI-HF, a reduction in death was observed among post–myocardial infarction patients taking 1 g of omega-3 PUFA (850–882 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] and docosahexaenoic acid [DHA] as ethyl esters in the ratio of 1:1.2), with a post hoc subgroup analysis indicating concentration of benefit in approximately 2000 patients with reduced LVEF. In symptomatic HF, patients were randomized to 1 g daily of omega-3 PUFA (850–882 mg of EPA+DHA) or placebo, with death from any cause reduced from 29% with placebo to 27% in those treated; the composite of death or admission to hospital for a cardiovascular event was also significantly reduced.

### Omega-6 fats for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^114CL6my]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Omega-6 fats are polyunsaturated fats vital for many physiological functions, but their effect on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is debated.

Objectives

To assess effects of increasing omega-6 fats (linoleic acid (LA), gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA) and arachidonic acid (AA)) on CVD and all-cause mortality.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE and Embase to May 2017 and clinicaltrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to September 2016, without language restrictions. We checked trials included in relevant systematic reviews.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing higher versus lower omega-6 fat intake in adults with or without CVD, assessing effects over at least 12 months. We included full texts, abstracts, trials registry entries and unpublished studies. Outcomes were all-cause mortality, CVD mortality, CVD events, risk factors (blood lipids, adiposity, blood pressure), and potential adverse events. We excluded trials where we could not separate omega-6 fat effects from those of other dietary, lifestyle or medication interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened titles/abstracts, assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias of included trials. We wrote to authors of included studies. Meta-analyses used random-effects analysis, while sensitivity analyses used fixed-effects and limited analyses to trials at low summary risk of bias. We assessed GRADE quality of evidence for 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included 19 RCTs in 6461 participants who were followed for one to eight years. Seven trials assessed the effects of supplemental GLA and 12 of LA, none DGLA or AA; the omega-6 fats usually displaced dietary saturated or monounsaturated fats. We assessed three RCTs as being at low summary risk of bias. Primary outcomes: we found low-quality evidence that increased intake of omega-6 fats may make little or no difference to all-cause mortality (risk ratio (RR) 1.00, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.88 to 1.12, 740 deaths, 4506 randomised, 10 trials) or CVD events (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81 to 1.15, 1404 people experienced events of 4962 randomised, 7 trials). We are uncertain whether increasing omega-6 fats affects CVD mortality (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.55, 472 deaths, 4019 randomised, 7 trials), coronary heart disease events (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.17, 1059 people with events of 3997 randomised, 7 trials), major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.20, 817 events, 2879 participants, 2 trials) or stroke (RR 1.36, 95% CI 0.45 to 4.11, 54 events, 3730 participants, 4 trials), as we assessed the evidence as being of very low quality. We found no evidence of dose-response or duration effects for any primary outcome, but there was a suggestion of greater protection in participants with lower baseline omega-6 intake across outcomes. Additional key outcomes: we found increased intake of omega-6 fats may reduce myocardial infarction (MI) risk (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.02, 609 events, 4606 participants, 7 trials, low-quality evidence). High-quality evidence suggests increasing omega-6 fats reduces total serum cholesterol a little in the long term (mean difference (MD) -0.33 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.50 to -0.16, I² = 81%; heterogeneity partially explained by dose, 4280 participants, 10 trials). Increasing omega-6 fats probably has little or no effect on adiposity (body mass index (BMI) MD -0.20 kg/m 2, 95% CI -0.56 to 0.16, 371 participants, 1 trial, moderate-quality evidence). It may make little or no difference to serum triglycerides (MD -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.21, 834 participants, 5 trials), HDL (MD -0.01 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.03 to 0.02, 1995 participants, 4 trials) or low-density lipoprotein (MD -0.04 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.21 to 0.14, 244 participants, 2 trials, low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

This is the most extensive systematic assessment of effects of omega-6 fats on cardiovascular health, mortality, lipids and adiposity to date, using previously unpublished data. We found no evidence that increasing omega-6 fats reduces cardiovascular outcomes other than MI, where 53 people may need to increase omega-6 fat intake to prevent 1 person from experiencing MI. Although benefits of omega-6 fats remain to be proven, increasing omega-6 fats may be of benefit in people at high risk of MI. Increased omega-6 fats reduce serum total cholesterol but not other blood fat fractions or adiposity.

### Dietary fatty acids [^115WGtF1]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Fatty acids can be divided into four general categories: saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and trans fats. Saturated fatty acids and trans fats are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease. Monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids are associated with a decreased risk of coronary heart disease, although these associations are not uniformly supported in the literature. Omega-3 fatty acids, which are a type of polyunsaturated fatty acid, have been studied as potential therapy for a variety of medical conditions because of their suspected anti-inflammatory properties. Omega-3 fatty acids have also been shown to provide some benefit to patients with cystic fibrosis, and may have a protective effect against dementia. Physicians should counsel patients about the importance of avoiding hydrogenated oils and foods containing trans fats because of their association with coronary heart disease in observational studies.

### Use of supplemental long-chain omega-3 fatty acids and risk for cardiac death: an updated meta-analysis and review of research gaps [^117UhZDC]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing use of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-OM3), primarily eicosapentaenoic acid, and/or docosahexaenoic acid have shown mixed results.

Objective

The objectives of the study were to update and further explore the available RCT data regarding LC-OM3 supplementation and risk for cardiac death and to propose testable hypotheses for the mixed results obtained in RCTs regarding supplemental LC-OM3 use and cardiac risk.

Methods

A literature search was conducted using PubMed and Ovid/MEDLINE for RCTs assessing LC-OM3 supplements or pharmaceuticals with intervention periods of at least 6 months and reporting on the outcome of cardiac death. Meta-analysis was used to compare cumulative frequencies of cardiac death events between the LC-OM3 and control groups, including sensitivity and subset analyses.

Results

Fourteen RCTs were identified for the primary analysis (71,899 subjects). In the LC-OM3 arms, 1613 cardiac deaths were recorded (4.48% of subjects), compared with 1746 cardiac deaths in the control groups (4.87% of subjects). The pooled relative risk estimate showed an 8.0% (95% confidence interval 1.6%, 13.9%, P = 0.015) lower risk in the LC-OM3 arms vs controls. Subset analyses showed numerically larger effects (12.9%-29.1% lower risks, all P < .05) in subsets of RCTs with eicosapentaenoic acid + docosahexaenoic acid dosages > 1 g/d and higher risk samples (secondary prevention, baseline mean or median triglycerides ≥ 150 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ≥ 130 mg/dL, statin use < 40% of subjects). Heterogeneity was low (I 2 ≤ 15.5%, P > .05) for the primary and subset analyses.

Conclusion

LC-OM3 supplementation is associated with a modest reduction in cardiac death.

### Recent findings on the health effects of omega-3 fatty acids and statins, and their interactions: do statins inhibit omega-3? [^116oiLNo]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

In summary, these three RCTs do not support a strong protective effect of EPA+DHA against malignant arrhythmias in patients with an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD). There are, however, several limitations in each trial: short follow-up, small sample size and medical heterogeneity - ischemic vs. non-ischemic heart disease - of the enrolled patients. Thus, they should be considered individually with precaution. In a subsequent meta-analysis combining the three trials, it was again concluded that EPA+DHA are not protective. However, the effect among patients with ischemic heart disease (hazard ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.06) tended toward protection. It has to be noted that the pooled sample size remained small suggesting that the meta-analysis itself was underpowered to detect protection in patients with ischemic heart disease. Finally, in a post-hoc analysis combining the two trials in which statins were prescribed to some patients (n = 333), a significant interaction (P < 0.05) was noted between statins and n-3 suggesting that the association of statins with n-3 may reduce the benefits of each treatment. Indeed, in the trial with the most favorable effect of n-3, no patient was taking a statin. While this interaction, also reported in the meta-analysis discussed above, might be a chance finding, it becomes critical to address the issue in future studies. Overall then, these recent RCTs suggest that among patients not severely n-3 deficient at baseline, n-3 supplements may reduce the risk of malignant arrhythmias, but only among patients with ischemic heart disease and not taking statins. This would reach agreement with early RCTs and current knowledge on n-3 and CVD complications.

### Cardiovascular, electrophysiologic, and hematologic effects of omega-3 fatty acids beyond reducing hypertriglyceridemia: as it pertains to the recently published REDUCE-IT trial [^116t6sm5]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2019). Medium credibility.

Heart disease continues to affect health outcomes globally, accounting for a quarter of all deaths in the United States. Despite the improvement in the development and implementation of guideline-directed medical therapy, the risk of adverse cardiac events remains substantially high. Historically, it has been debated whether omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids provide clinical benefit in cardiac disease. The recently published REDUCE-IT trial demonstrated a statistically significant absolute risk reduction of 4.8% in its primary endpoint (cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or unstable angina) with the use of icosapent ethyl, which is a highly purified eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) ethyl ester. However, the mechanism of action of omega-3 fatty acids is not commonly discussed. Moreover, the use of EPA was not without risk, as the incidence of atrial fibrillation was increased along with a trend towards increased bleeding risk. Thus, our aim is to help explain the function of purified EPA ethyl ester, especially at the molecular level, which will ultimately lead to a better understanding of their clinically observable effects.

### Omega-3 dietary supplements and the risk of cardiovascular events: a systematic review [^116pVWfi]. Clinical Cardiology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Epidemiologic data suggest that omega-3 fatty acids derived from fish oil reduce cardiovascular disease. The clinical benefit of dietary fish oil supplementation in preventing cardiovascular events in both high and low risk patients is unclear.

Objective

To assess whether dietary supplements of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) decrease cardiovascular events across a spectrum of patients.

Data Sources

MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and citation review of relevant primary and review articles.

Study Selection

Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials that evaluated clinical cardiovascular end points (cardiovascular death, sudden death, and nonfatal cardiovascular events) and all-cause mortality in patients randomized to EPA/DHA or placebo. We only included studies that used dietary supplements of EPA/DHA which were administered for at least 1 year.

Data Extraction

Data were abstracted on study design, study size, type and dose of omega-3 supplement, cardiovascular events, all-cause mortality, and duration of follow-up. Studies were grouped according to the risk of cardiovascular events (high risk and moderate risk). Meta-analytic techniques were used to analyze the data.

Data Synthesis

We identified 11 studies that included a total of 39 044 patients. The studies included patients after recent myocardial infarction, those with an implanted cardioverter defibrillator, and patients with heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, and hypercholesterolemia. The average dose of EPA/DHA was 1.8 ± 1.2 g/day and the mean duration of follow-up was 2.2 ± 1.2 years. Dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular deaths (odds ratio [OR]: 0.87, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.79–0.95, p = 0.002), sudden cardiac death (OR: 0.87, 95% CI: 0.76–0.99, p = 0.04), all-cause mortality (OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.85–0.99, p = 0.02), and nonfatal cardiovascular events (OR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.85–0.99, p = 0.02). The mortality benefit was largely due to the studies which enrolled high risk patients, while the reduction in nonfatal cardiovascular events was noted in the moderate risk patients (secondary prevention only). Meta-regression failed to demonstrate a relationship between the daily dose of omega-3 fatty acid and clinical outcome.

Conclusions

Dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids should be considered in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events.

### Recent findings on the health effects of omega-3 fatty acids and statins, and their interactions: do statins inhibit omega-3? [^112TvhKz]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Contrary to the expectations, the most recent RCTs - that is, those published after 2005 - did not confirm the protective action of n-3. In a recent meta-analysis examining the efficacy of n-3 supplements (EPA+DHA) in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD), authors analyzed 13 RCTs involving 20,485 patients with a history of CHD and concluded that n-3 supplements did not consistently reduce CHD mortality, all-cause mortality and the risk of overall CVD complications. An explanation could be that the populations enrolled in the most recent RCTs were different from those tested in the past RCTs. Indeed, the authors did not separate early (positive) and recent (negative) RCTs in their meta-analyses and thereby ignored any temporal changes in the dietary and blood n-3 status of the patients enrolled in the early or the recent RCTs. Also, in subgroup analyses by concomitant medication use, the authors report a non-significant preventive effect against the risk of CVD events (relative risk 0.74, 95% confidence intervals 0.54 to 1.03) among patients not receiving statins whereas those receiving statins had no protection at all: relative risk 1.02, 95% confidence intervals 0.92 to 1.12. These data suggest strong interactions between n-3 and statins and may at least partly explain the discrepancy between recent and early RCTs because the use of statins has become almost systematic among patients in recent RCTs, whereas it was rare or even absent in early RCTs.

Another puzzling observation is that, contrary to the results of recent RCTs, recent epidemiological studies examining associations between n-3 (or fish intake) and CVD in various populations still demonstrate significant inverse correlation. This further suggests that in populations with low use of statins, n-3 remain apparently protective.

How could these findings be explained?

### Emerging mechanisms of cardiovascular protection for the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid [^114CKuqr]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

Highlights

Omega-3 fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have multiple biological effects.
In the REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events With Icosapent Ethyl–Intervention Trial), a prescription EPA-only formulation called icosapent ethyl reduced cardiovascular events by 25% in high-risk patients with either established cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus plus other risk factors.
Cardiovascular outcomes trials that have evaluated mixed (DHA-containing) omega-3 fatty acids on top of contemporary medical therapy have thus far not shown the benefits of icosapent ethyl as seen in REDUCE-IT and the JELIS (Japan EPA Lipid Intervention Study), highlighting the importance of understanding molecular mechanisms of action of specific omega-3 fatty acids.
EPA and DHA differ markedly, with distinct effects on membrane structure, rates of lipid oxidation, inflammatory biomarkers, and endothelial function, as well as tissue distributions.
Ongoing scientific efforts to understand the mechanism of action for EPA will help usher in a new era of cardiovascular therapeutics.

Baseline characteristics of trials and participants.

Nineteen studies were judged at low risk of bias in all domains. All other studies had probably a high or high risk of bias in the domains of selective outcome reporting, incomplete outcome data, or blinding of participants and personnel or outcome assessment.

A total of 25 trials (n = 143,514) reported 5550 events of cardiovascular mortality, and 24 trials (n = 140,983) reported 10,795 events of all-cause mortality. Omega-3 FA was associated with reducing cardiovascular mortality (-1.4 incident cases per 1000 person-years [-2.5, -0.4]; RR, 0.93 [0.88–0.98]; p = 0.01; moderate certainty; Fig. 2) but not all-cause mortality (-0.6 incident cases per 1000-person years [-1.4, 0.4]; RR, 0.97 [0.93–1.02]; p = 0.27; low certainty; Appendix p 15). Meta-analysis showed reduction in cardiovascular mortality with EPA monotherapy (RR: 0.82 [0.68–0.99]; p = 0.04) and EPA+DHA combination (RR: 0.94 [0.89–0.99]; p = 0.02) (p for interaction = 0.19).

### Triglycerides, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular outcome studies: focus on omega-3 fatty acids [^1134Ao2b]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an overview of the roles of triglycerides and triglyceride-lowering agents in atherosclerosis in the context of cardiovascular outcomes studies.

Methods

We reviewed the published literature as well as ClinicalTrials.gov entries for ongoing studies.

Results

Despite improved atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes with statin therapy, residual risk remains. Epidemiologic data and recent genetic insights provide compelling evidence that triglycerides are in the causal pathway for the development of atherosclerosis, thereby renewing interest in targeting triglycerides to improve ASCVD outcomes. Fibrates, niacin, and omega-3 fatty acids (OM3FAs) are three classes of triglyceride-lowering drugs. Outcome studies with triglyceride-lowering agents have been inconsistent. With regard to OM3FAs, the JELIS study showed that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) significantly reduced major coronary events in statin-treated hypercholesterolemic patients. Regarding other agents, extended-release niacin and fenofibrate are no longer recommended as statin add-on therapy (by some guidelines, though not all) because of the lack of convincing evidence from outcome studies. Notably, subgroup analyses from the outcome studies have generated the hypothesis that triglyceride lowering may provide benefit in statin-treated patients with persistent hypertriglyceridemia. Two ongoing OM3FA outcome studies (REDUCE-IT and STRENGTH) are testing this hypothesis in high-risk, statin-treated patients with triglyceride levels of 200 to 500 mg/dL.

Conclusion

There is consistent evidence that triglycerides are in the causal pathway of atherosclerosis but inconsistent evidence from cardiovascular outcomes studies as to whether triglyceride-lowering agents reduce cardiovascular risk. Ongoing outcomes studies will determine the role of triglyceride lowering in statin-treated patients with high-dose prescription OM3FAs in terms of improved ASCVD outcomes.

### Heart failure (HF) guideline (2017) [^116LfLDv]. AND (2017). Medium credibility.

Omega-3 fatty acid supplementation — Heart failure (NYHA Classes I - IV/AHA Stages B and C) evidence reported no significant effect on mortality rates with 2 g/day for six months to one year; a trial using 2 g/day of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for one year showed a significant decrease in NYHA functional class compared to an increase in the placebo group; and 2 g/day for three to six months resulted in significant decreases in BNP levels. Because omega-3 may increase the effects of warfarin, aspirin, clopidogrel, and vitamin E, it is unclear whether this dose and duration would be appropriate; research is needed regarding length of stay, quality of life, and effects on BUN, creatinine, and serum sodium (Grade III).

### N-3 fatty acids and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with dysglycemia [^111PpXHp]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2012). Excellent credibility.

The study ORIGIN n-3 Fatty Acids was published by ORIGIN Trial Investigators and colleagues in 2012 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Diabetes mellitus type 2. In the ORIGIN n-3 Fatty Acids study, the trial question was: what is the role of n-3 fatty acids in patients with or at risk for T2DM mellitus? In the ORIGIN n-3 Fatty Acids study, the study design was: multi-center, double blinded, RCT. In the ORIGIN n-3 Fatty Acids study, the population was: 12536 patients (4386 female, 8150 male). The inclusion criteria were patients who were at high risk for cardiovascular events and had impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or diabetes. The key exclusion criteria were unwilling to discontinue use of a nonstudy preparation of n-3 fatty acids, glycated hemoglobin level ≥ 9%, CABG within the previous 4 years with no intervening cardiovascular event, severe HF, or cancer that might affect survival. In the ORIGIN n-3 Fatty Acids study, the interventions were: n = 6281 n-3 fatty acid supplementation (1 g capsule containing at least 900 mg of ethyl esters) n = 6255 placebo (capsule containing 1 g of olive oil). In the ORIGIN n-3 Fatty Acids study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in cardiovascular death (9.1% vs. 9.3%; HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.1). In the ORIGIN n-3 Fatty Acids study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in major vascular events (16.5% vs. 16.3%; HR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.1) No significant difference in death from any cause (15.1% vs. 15.4%; HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.07) No significant difference in arrhythmic death (4.6% vs. 4.1%; HR 1.1, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.3). In the ORIGIN n-3 Fatty Acids study, the safety outcomes were: no significant difference in adverse effects. significant differences in triglycerides (-23.5 vs. -9.0 mg/dL, p < 0.001). In the ORIGIN n-3 Fatty Acids study, the conclusion was: in patients who were at high risk for cardiovascular events and had impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, or diabetes, n-3 fatty acid supplementation was not superior to placebo with respect to cardiovascular death.

### Fish oil omega-3 fatty acids and cardio-metabolic health, alone or with statins [^113ZqWXo]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

The impact of the fish-derived omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes incidence and risk has been widely investigated. Although the balance of evidence suggests substantial benefits with respect to CVD mortality, there is little evidence for an impact of these fatty acids on insulin sensitivity and diabetes incidence, despite very promising data from animal models. The focus here will be the plasma lipid modulatory effects of EPA and DHA and will include an exploration of the potential and demonstrated complementarity between statins and EPA/DHA on overall CVD risk and the plasma cholesterol and triglyceride profile. Although there is some justification for greater general population and patient EPA+DHA intakes, an often overlooked major obstacle is that global fish stocks are limited and insufficient to meet demands. The potential of emerging 'non-fish foods' to provide affordable and sustainable sources of EPA+DHA will also be briefly discussed.

### Evidence for the cardioprotective effects of omega-3 fatty acids [^115uRkAU]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To review available literature regarding the cardiovascular effects of marine-derived Omega-3 fatty acids and evaluate the benefit of these fatty acids in the prevention of coronary heart disease.

Data Sources

Biomedical literature accessed through a MEDLINE search (1966-April 2002). Search terms included fish oil, omega-3 fatty acid, sudden death, hypertriglyceridemia, myocardial infarction, and mortality.

Data Synthesis

Following an early 1970's observational investigation that Omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the occurrence of myocardial infarction-related deaths in Greenland Eskimos, additional trials have been conducted that support this finding. Epidemiologic and clinical trial data suggest that Omega-3 fatty acids may reduce the risk of cardiovascular-related death by 29–52%. In addition, the risk of sudden cardiac death was found to be reduced by 45–81%. Possible mechanisms for these beneficial effects include antiarrhythmic properties, improved endothelial function, antiinflammatory action, and reductions in serum triglyceride concentrations. Omega-3 Fatty acids are fairly well tolerated; potential adverse effects include bloating and gastrointestinal distress, "fishy taste" in the mouth, hyperglycemia, increased risk of bleeding, and a slight increase in low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol.

Conclusions

Omega-3 Fatty acids may be beneficial and should be considered in patients with documented coronary heart disease. They may be particularly beneficial for patients with risk factors for sudden cardiac death.

### Omega 3 fatty acids for prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease [^116mF3k2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

It has been suggested that omega 3 (W3, n-3 or omega-3) fats from oily fish and plants are beneficial to health.

Objectives

To assess whether dietary or supplemental omega 3 fatty acids alter total mortality, cardiovascular events or cancers using both RCT and cohort studies.

Search Strategy

Five databases including CENTRAL, MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched to February 2002. No language restrictions were applied. Bibliographies were checked and authors contacted.

Selection Criteria

RCTs were included where omega 3 intake or advice was randomly allocated and unconfounded, and study duration was at least six months. Cohorts were included where a cohort was followed up for at least six months and omega 3 intake estimated.

Data Collection and Analysis

Studies were assessed for inclusion, data extracted and quality assessed independently in duplicate. Random effects meta-analysis was performed separately for RCT and cohort data.

Main Results

Forty eight randomised controlled trials (36,913 participants) and 41 cohort analyses were included. Pooled trial results did not show a reduction in the risk of total mortality or combined cardiovascular events in those taking additional omega 3 fats (with significant statistical heterogeneity). Sensitivity analysis, retaining only studies at low risk of bias, reduced heterogeneity and again suggested no significant effect of omega 3 fats. Restricting analysis to trials increasing fish-based omega 3 fats, or those increasing short chain omega 3s, did not suggest significant effects on mortality or cardiovascular events in either group. Subgroup analysis by dietary advice or supplementation, baseline risk of CVD or omega 3 dose suggested no clear effects of these factors on primary outcomes. Neither RCTs nor cohorts suggested increased relative risk of cancers with higher omega 3 intake but estimates were imprecise so a clinically important effect could not be excluded.

Reviewers' Conclusions

It is not clear that dietary or supplemental omega 3 fats alter total mortality, combined cardiovascular events or cancers in people with, or at high risk of, cardiovascular disease or in the general population. There is no evidence we should advise people to stop taking rich sources of omega 3 fats, but further high quality trials are needed to confirm suggestions of a protective effect of omega 3 fats on cardiovascular health. There is no clear evidence that omega 3 fats differ in effectiveness according to fish or plant sources, dietary or supplemental sources, dose or presence of placebo.

### Emerging pathways of action of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) [^117F8KpW]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2025). Medium credibility.

Substantial randomized data support the cardiovascular benefits of the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Yet, lack of a clear understanding of the likely multifactorial mechanism of benefit of EPA has generated skepticism among some physicians, potentially leading to underuse of this clinically beneficial, cost-effective, and safe therapy. The REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl–Intervention Trial) showed large relative and absolute risk reductions in ischemic events with icosapent ethyl (a highly purified, pharmaceutical grade ethyl ester of EPA), including a significant reduction in cardiovascular death in secondary and high-risk primary prevention patients with mildly to moderately elevated triglycerides. Interestingly, the benefit extended across the full range of baseline triglyceride values in the trial, including in the subgroup of patients who entered the trial with normal triglyceride levels. Similarly, the benefit of icosapent ethyl extended to those patients who either did or did not achieve triglyceride levels within the normal range during the trial. Mediation analyses suggested that the triglyceride reduction accounted for a minority of the drug's benefit, with approximately two-thirds of the benefit caused by the large increase in serum EPA that occurred on treatment. However, that observation does not actually explain how the EPA itself exerts its cardioprotective benefits.

### Emerging mechanisms of cardiovascular protection for the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid [^111ScCn8]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

High-Dose Omega-3 Fatty Acid Treatment and Residual Cardiovascular Risk

Despite the success of LDL (low-density lipoprotein)-lowering therapies in reducing cardiovascular risk, individuals with well-controlled LDL still have residual cardiovascular risk associated in part with elevated triglycerides. The REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl–Intervention Trial) that tested an omega-3 fatty acid (n3-FA)-based therapy of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) demonstrated cardiovascular risk reduction in addition to the protection afforded by statins. REDUCE-IT demonstrated that a highly purified ethyl ester of EPA, icosapent ethyl, significantly reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization in at-risk patients with triglycerides above ≈100 mg/dL despite being treated with statins. – First ischemic events fell by 25% (P = 0.00000001) and total (first and subsequent) ischemic events by 31% (P = 0.0000000004), with consistent benefits across multiple prespecified subgroups, including primary and secondary prevention. The prespecified subgroup of 3146 patients randomized in the United States demonstrated benefits at least as robust as the overall population, with a notable 30% lower rate of mortality (P = 0.004) in those randomized to icosapent ethyl. The EPA treatment used yielded consistent benefits across baseline levels of triglycerides as well, including in the ≈10% of participants with normal triglycerides.

The large relative and absolute risk reductions in several different types of end points from REDUCE-IT seemed to exceed that expected by the degree of triglyceride lowering, suggesting that other properties of EPA likely contribute to the benefits, as will be discussed – (Figure 1). Beyond the effect on lowering triglyceride levels, EPA has cell-membrane stabilizing properties that may explain, in part, the significant reductions seen in death from cardiovascular causes (20% reduction), sudden cardiac death (31% reduction), and cardiac arrest (48% reduction). Of note, the results of REDUCE-IT apply to a broad population of at-risk patients. The findings from REDUCE-IT contrast sharply with previous outcome trials that showed no cardiovascular benefit using EPA/docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) combinations or dietary supplements that may contain oxidized fatty acids and saturated fat. – Further trials with high-dose n3-FAs in various groups will provide additional insight into this question.

### Recent findings on the health effects of omega-3 fatty acids and statins, and their interactions: do statins inhibit omega-3? [^112cnUeJ]. BMC Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

In a second RCT (Omega), 3,851 survivors of a recent myocardial infarction were given 0.84 g/day of EPA+DHA (compared with a placebo). About 95% of the patients were taking a statin and the consumption of n-3 was rather high as only 3% of patients were not eating fish and about half of the patients were eating fish several times a week. There was no significant difference between the patients receiving n-3 and those taking the placebo. A major limitation of the trial was the short follow-up (one year).

In a third trial (Alpha Omega), 4,837 patients who had a myocardial infarction were randomized to receive for 40 months one of four margarines: a margarine supplemented with EPA+DHA, a margarine supplemented with ALA, a margarine supplemented with EPA+DHA+ALA and a placebo margarine. On average, patients consumed 19 g of margarine per day, which resulted in additional daily intakes of 380 mg EPA+DHA, 1.9 g ALA or both in the active-treatment groups. About 86% of patients were taking a statin and average consumption of fish at baseline was 15 g/day in each subgroup corresponding to an average intake of EPA+DHA of about 125 mg/day, which was confirmed by measuring blood n-3. Treatment with n-3 did not reduce the risk in the primary analysis whereas some benefits, in subgroup analyses, could be seen in women and diabetics.

In a subsequent analysis, the Alpha Omega investigators explored the interactions between statins and n-3 with the hypothesis that statins may have reduced the protective effects of n-3. They analyzed separately statin users and non-users. Among statin users, 13% developed CVD complications against 15% among non-users and n-3 supplementation did not reduce complications among statin users. However, among statin non-users, only 9% of those receiving n-3 developed CVD complications compared with 18% in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.46, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.01). The authors conclude that statins reduced the effects of n-3 fatty acids. But contrary to their hypothesis stating that the absence of benefits of n-3 resulted from a dilution effect - no additional benefit of n-3 could be seen in patients strongly protected by statins - it might also be hypothesized that statins inhibit n-3 because the lowest risk was indeed seen among statin non-users taking n-3.

### Emerging mechanisms of cardiovascular protection for the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid [^114wFFUw]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

Figure 1.
Potential mechanisms of cardioprotection for omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids may lessen risk of cardiovascular events through a number of mechanisms that contribute to their overall protective actions. Lowering of TGRL (triglyceride-rich lipoprotein) may account for some but certainly not all of the observed benefits (Figure 2). By boosting the production of anti-aggregatory and vasodilatory prostanoids, such as prostacyclin, omega-3 fatty acids may combat thrombosis as well as vasospasm. Omega-3 fatty acids can incorporate into plasma membranes and those of the mitochondria potentially stabilizing them to resist oxidation and confer protection against arrhythmias. Omega-3 fatty acids and certain prostanoids produced from them can exert anti-inflammatory actions. In addition, the omega-3 fatty acids can provide precursors for the synthesis of specialized proresolving mediators that can combat inflammation, perhaps causing less interference with his defenses than direct anti-inflammatory therapies. A combination of these various mechanisms may contribute to the cardiovascular protection associated with omega-3 fatty acid consumption. DHA indicates docosahexaenoic acid; and EPA, eicosapentaenoic acid.

The REDUCE-IT trial followed the JELIS trial (Japan EPA Lipid Intervention Study), which demonstrated that purified EPA (1.8 g/d) reduced the risk of major coronary events in hypercholesterolemic patients receiving statin therapy versus those subjected to statin monotherapy. JELIS did not prespecify a minimum triglyceride level for inclusion into the study. This open-label, randomized trial, showed a 19% reduction (P = 0.011) in cardiovascular events overall in the trial in the EPA group, with consistent benefits in both secondary and primary prevention. Notably, the median triglyceride level at baseline was only slightly above 150 mg/dL, meaning that approximately half of the patients had normal triglycerides. However, in post hoc analyses, among those subjects with higher triglyceride levels (> 150 mg/dL) and low HDL-C (high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol) levels (< 40 mg/dL), there was 53% reduction in events with EPA treatment.

### Omega 3 fatty acids and cardiovascular outcomes: systematic review and meta-analysis [^113M5F8e]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Early trials evaluating the effect of omega 3 fatty acids (ω-3 FA) reported benefits for mortality and cardiovascular events but recent larger studies trials have variable findings. We assessed the effects of ω-3 FA on cardiovascular and other important clinical outcomes.

Methods and Results

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials for all randomized studies using dietary supplements, dietary interventions, or both. The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular events (mostly myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death). Secondary outcomes were arrhythmia, cerebrovascular events, hemorrhagic stroke, ischemic stroke, coronary revascularization, heart failure, total mortality, nonvascular mortality, and end-stage kidney disease. Twenty studies including 63030 participants were included. There was no overall effect of ω-3 FA on composite cardiovascular events (relative risk [RR] = 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.90–1.03; P = 0.24) or on total mortality (RR = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.86–1.04; P = 0.28). ω-3 FA did protect against vascular death (RR = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.75–0.99; P = 0.03) but not coronary events (RR = 0.86; 95% CI, 0.67–1.11; P = 0.24). There was no effect on arrhythmia (RR = 0.99; 95% CI, 0.85–1.16; P = 0.92) or cerebrovascular events (RR = 1.03; 95% CI, 0.92–1.16; P = 0.59). Adverse events were more common in the treatment group than the placebo group (RR = 1.18, 95% CI, 1.02–1.37; P = 0.03), predominantly because of an excess of gastrointestinal side effects.

Conclusions

ω-3 FA may protect against vascular disease, but the evidence is not clear-cut, and any benefits are almost certainly not as great as previously believed.

### N-3 fatty acids and cardiovascular disease [^113cFaNU]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2006). Low credibility.

The results of prospective cohort studies indicate that consuming fish or fish oil containing the n-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is associated with decreased cardiovascular death, whereas consumption of the vegetable oil-derived n-3 fatty acid a-linolenic acid is not as effective. Randomized control trials (RCTs) in the context of secondary prevention also indicate that the consumption of EPA plus DHA is protective at doses < 1 g/d. The therapeutic effect appears to be due to suppression of fatal arrhythmias rather than stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques. At doses > 3 g/d, EPA plus DHA can improve cardiovascular disease risk factors, including decreasing plasma triacylglycerols, blood pressure, platelet aggregation, and inflammation, while improving vascular reactivity. Mainly on the basis of the results of RCTs, the American Heart Association recommends that everyone eat oily fish twice per week and that those with coronary heart disease eat 1 g/d of EPA plus DHA from oily fish or supplements. Directions for future research include (1) RCTs to confirm the initial trials showing that EPA plus DHA decreases cardiovascular death and additional studies to determine whether this effect is due to EPA, DHA, or the combination; the dosage of the effective components; and whether the mechanism of action in humans is prevention of fatal arrhythmias. (2) Clinical studies to determine whether the reduction in cardiovascular disease risk factors is due to EPA, DHA, or the combination and the dosage of the effective components. (3) Clinical studies to determine whether vegetable oil-derived alpha-linolenic acid added to a diet enriched in n-6 fatty acids can effectively substitute for fish oil-derived EPA plus DHA.

### Effect of omega-3 fatty acids on cardiovascular outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1155jrH5]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

We noted significant variation in the relative estimates attributed to omega-3 FA formulations, with EPA trials demonstrating greater reductions in cardiovascular outcomes than those of EPA+DHA. These findings are plausible in the context of distinct biological properties not shared by EPA and DHA. Various studies have shed light on the distinct structure, formation, and metabolism of EPA and DHA and their biological effects. Although some studies have reported comparable or even greater efficacy of DHA in reducing TGs and individual pro-inflammatory cytokines than EPA, a significant body of evidence suggests that both EPA and DHA markedly differ regarding their effects on membrane structure, inflammatory cascade, lipid oxidation, endothelial function, and tissue distribution. In vivo, omega-3 FAs (EPA and DHA) as well as omega-6 FA (arachidonic acid [AA]) are involved in formation of key regulators of inflammation, vasodilation, and platelet aggregation. For example, the eicosanoids are produced by oxidative pathways of the cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) enzymes. Increased omega-6 FA intake favors high AA content in membrane phospholipids, leading to excess pro-inflammatory cytokine production through COX and LOX pathways. In contrast, a high intake of omega-3 FA results in the increased production of EPA, which competes with AA through the same COX and LOX pathways, mitigating pro-inflammatory cytokines and generating mediators that improve vasodilation and decrease inflammation and aggregation. Furthermore, DHA (generated after elongation, desaturation, and peroxisomal beta-oxidation of the EPA) along with EPA competes with AA for the cytochrome P450 enzymes, resulting in the production of a different set of vasodilators. These EPA- and DHA-derived moieties exert different effects on the cardiovascular system.

### Effects of omega-3 fatty acids on resting heart rate, heart rate recovery after exercise, and heart rate variability in men with healed myocardial infarctions and depressed ejection fractions [^111W4Gh5]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2006). Low credibility.

We explored possible mechanisms by which recommended intakes of omega-3 fatty acids may decrease the risk for sudden cardiac death in patients with documented coronary heart disease. The cardioprotective effects of omega-3 fatty acids have been documented in epidemiologic and randomized controlled trials. These fatty acids are presumed to decrease susceptibility to fatal arrhythmias, but whether this is mediated by classic risk factors or direct cardiac mechanisms is not known. Eighteen white men with a history of myocardial infarction and ejection fractions < 40% were randomized to placebo or omega-3 fatty acids (585 mg of docosahexaenoic acid and 225 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid) for two 4-month periods in a crossover design. At the end of each period, heart rate (HR), HR variability, and rate of HR recovery after exercise were determined, as were effects on arterial compliance, blood pressure, cardiac function, and fasting serum levels of lipids and inflammatory markers. Omega-3 fatty acids decreased HR at rest from 73 ± 13 to 68 ± 13 beats/min (p < 0.0001) and improved 1-minute HR recovery after exercise (-27 ± 10 to -32 ± 12 beats/min, p < 0.01). HR variability in the high-frequency band increased (p < 0.02), but no change was noted in overall HR variability. There were no significant effects on blood pressure, arterial compliance, lipids, or inflammatory markers. These changes are consistent with an increase in vagal activity and may in part explain the observed decrease in risk for sudden cardiac death seen with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation.

### Plasma fatty acid profiles: relationships with sex, age, and state-reported heart disease mortality rates in the United States [^113Ff6gT]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Fatty acids (FA) play an important role in health and heart disease risk.

Objective

We evaluated relationships of plasma FA levels, especially omega-3 FA, with sex, age, and reported heart disease mortality rates by state in a very large clinical population.

Methods

Plasma FA were measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry after lipid extraction in 1,169,621 fasting United States subjects grouped according to sex (56.2% female), age (< 30, 30- < 45, 45- < 55, 55- < 65, ≥ 65 years; median age 58.2 years), and state of residence.

Results

Plasma FA index values (median ± interquartile range), expressed as a percent of total plasma FA, in all subjects were: saturated (14:0+16:0+18:0) 31.4 ± 1.5%; monounsaturated (16:1n7-cis+18:1n9-cis) 21.3 ± 2.2%; trans (16:1n7-trans+18:1n9-trans) 0.45 ± 0.08%; omega-6 (18:2n6-cis+20:3n6+20:4n6) 42.5 ± 3.0%; and omega-3 (20:5n3+22:6n3) 2.57 ± 0.81%. The median eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5n3) concentration was 22.1 ± 9.7 μg/mL. Females had significantly (P < 0.0001) higher omega-3 FA indices (+6.82%) than males. Subjects ≥ 65 years of age had a higher omega-3 FA index (+29.68%) and higher EPA levels (+57.05%) than subjects < 30 years of age (P < 0.00001). EPA concentrations and omega-3 FA indices were below overall median levels in most southern and midwestern states. State-reported heart disease mortality rates were inversely correlated with EPA levels (r = -0.504) and omega-3 FA indices (r = -0.570), and positively correlated with saturated FA indices (r = 0.450), all P < 0.01.

Conclusion

In our large population, females, subjects ≥ 65 years, and those living in northeastern and western states had higher omega-3 fatty acid levels and lower saturated fatty acid levels than other subjects. Such changes were associated with lower state-wide heart disease death rates.

### Omega-3 fatty acids [^111UzR1B]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to significantly reduce the risk for sudden death caused by cardiac arrhythmias and all-cause mortality in patients with known coronary heart disease. Fatty fish, such as salmon and tuna, and fish oil are rich sources of the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. Flaxseed, canola oil, and walnuts also are good dietary sources of omega-3 fatty acids. In addition to being antiarrhythmic, the omega-3 fatty acids are antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory. In contrast, omega-6 fatty acids, which are present in most seeds, vegetable oils, and meat, are prothrombotic and proinflammatory. Omega-3 fatty acids also are used to treat hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and rheumatoid arthritis. There are no significant drug interactions with omega-3 fatty acids. The American Heart Association recommends consumption of two servings of fish per week for persons with no history of coronary heart disease and at least one serving of fish daily for those with known coronary heart disease. Approximately 1 g per day of eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid is recommended for cardioprotection. Higher dosages of omega-3 fatty acids are required to reduce elevated triglyceride levels (2 to 4 g per day) and to reduce morning stiffness and the number of tender joints in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (at least 3 g per day). Modest decreases in blood pressure occur with significantly higher dosages of omega-3 fatty acids.

### Dietary and pharmacological fatty acids and cardiovascular health [^1147ESKf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

The effects of dietary intake of different fatty acids and pharmacological use of fatty acids, specifically long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC n-3 PUFAs), on cardiovascular health and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) prevention have been examined in a large number of observational studies and clinical trials. This review summarizes recent data and discusses potential mechanisms.

Evidence Acquisition

The review is based on the authors' knowledge of the field supplemented by a PubMed search using the terms seafood, fish oil, saturated fatty acids, omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, polyunsaturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, and ASCVD.

Evidence Synthesis

We mainly discuss the recent clinical trials that examine the effects of different types of dietary fatty acids and pharmacological use of n-3 PUFA products on ASCVD prevention and the potential mechanisms.

Conclusions

While replacement of dietary saturated fat with unsaturated fat, polyunsaturated fat in particular, or intake of LC n-3 PUFA-rich seafood has generally shown benefit for ASCVD prevention and is recommended for cardiovascular benefits, data on effects of n-3 PUFA products on ASCVD health are inconsistent. However, recent clinical trials support benefits of prescription EPA in ASCVD prevention. n-3 PUFAs may contribute to ASCVD prevention through multiple mechanisms, including lowering plasma triglyceride levels, anti-inflammatory effects, antithrombotic effects, and effects on endothelial function.

### Omega-3 supplementation and cardiovascular disease: formulation-based systematic review and meta-analysis with trial sequential analysis [^117P4pVN]. Heart (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Omega-3 supplements are popular for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. We aimed to assess the association between dose-specific omega-3 supplementation and CVD outcomes.

Design

We included double-blind randomised clinical trials with duration ≥ 1year assessing omega-3 supplementation and estimated the relative risk (RR) for all-cause mortality, cardiac death, sudden death, myocardial infarction and stroke. Primary analysis was a stratified random-effects meta-analysis by omega-3 dose in 4 a priori defined categories (< 1, 1, 2, ≥ 3 of 1 g capsules/day). Complementary approaches were trial sequential analysis and sensitivity analyses for triglycerides, prevention setting, intention-to-treat analysis, eicosapentaenoic acid, sample size, statin use, study duration.

Results

Seventeen studies (n = 83617) were included. Omega-3 supplementation as ≤ 1 capsule/day was not associated with any outcome under study; futility boundaries were crossed for all-cause mortality and cardiac death. For two capsules/day, we observed a statistically significant reduction of cardiac death (n = 3, RR 0.55, 95%CI 0.33 to 0.90, I² = 0%); for ≥ 3 capsules/day we observed a statistically significant reduction of cardiac death (n = 3, RR 0.82, 95%CI 0.68 to 0.99, I² = 0%), sudden death (n = 1, RR 0.70, 95%CI 0.51 to 0.97) and stroke (n = 2, RR 0.74, 95%CI 0.57 to 0.95, I² = 0%).

Conclusion

Omega-3 supplementation at < 2 1 g capsules/day showed no association with CVD outcomes; this seems unlikely to change from future research. Compared with the robust scientific evidence available for low doses, the evidence for higher doses (2–4 1 g capsules/day) is weak. The emerging postulated benefit from high-dose supplementation needs replication and further evaluation as to the precise formulation and indication.

### Effects of eicosapentaenoic acid vs eicosapentaenoic / docosahexaenoic acids on cardiovascular mortality: meta-analysis of clinical trials [^113hGzfR]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Purified eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and mixed eicosapentaenoic/docosahexaenoic acids (EPA/DHA) are omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) of interest for preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD) as adjunct to statins. Randomized clinical trial (RCT) evidence continues to emerge, including data from the RESPECT-EPA (Randomized Trial for Evaluation in Secondary Prevention Efficacy of Combination Therapy-Statin and Eicosapentaenoic Acid) trial, but n-3 PUFAs' roles in prevention remains controversial.

Objectives

The objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of EPA vs EPA/DHA compared to the standard preventive therapy across published RCTs investigating the use of n-3 PUFAs for primary or secondary prevention of CVD.

Methods

Following a prespecified protocol registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42023390587), we identified RCTs reporting CVD-attributable mortality in patients randomized to EPA, EPA/DHA, or a standard preventive therapy for primary or secondary CVD prevention. We used random effects meta-analysis to estimate pooled HRs of CVD-attributable mortality achieved with EPA or EPA/DHA relative to the standard preventive therapy.

Results

Sixteen RCTs met the inclusion criteria, representing 127,771 patients in total (41% women, mean age 64 ± 5 years). Median follow-up was 3.7 years (IQR: 2.7–5.0 years). Compared to the standard preventive therapy, CVD-attributable mortality was significantly reduced with purified EPA (HR: 0.79 [95% CI: 0.67–0.94]; P = 0.006); this effect was less for EPA/DHA (HR: 0.92 [95% CI: 0.84–1.00]; P = 0.044).

Conclusions

EPA lowered incident CVD-attributable mortality in RCTs investigating its use for primary or secondary CVD prevention. Relative to EPA, benefits reported with EPA/DHA were attenuated. Although more work is needed to understand these differences, EPA should preferentially be used in cardiovascular conditions for which it is indicated.

2.2 Data extraction

Two authors (S.U.K. and A.N.L) independently abstracted and adjudicated data on pre-specified data collection forms and resolved any discrepancies by consensus. We outlined data on characteristics of the trials and participants (age, sex, comorbidities, treatment arms and their composition [EPA vs. EPA+DHA with dosages]), control arms (active vs. placebo), follow-up duration, crude point estimates, events, and sample sizes for desired endpoints. Our efficacy outcomes of interest were cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, non-fatal MI, coronary heart disease (CHD) events, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), revascularization, non-fatal stroke, ischemic stroke, and hemorrhagic stroke. The safety endpoints included atrial fibrillation (AF), total bleeding, major and minor bleeding, and gastrointestinal adverse events. We defined CHD events as the number of participants experiencing the first occurrence of CHD or coronary events, total MI, acute coronary syndrome, or stable or unstable angina. We abstracted data on the intention-to-treat principle.

2.3 Risk of bias within individual studies

We used Cochrane criteria for assessing the risk of bias for each trial across the following domains: randomization, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessors, selective outcome reporting, incomplete outcome data, and others. We rated trials as (i) low risk of bias, (ii) some concerns — probably low risk of bias, (iii) some concerns — probably high risk of bias, or (iv) high risk of bias. Trials were rated as high risk of bias overall if one or more domains were rated probably high risk of bias or high risk of bias, and as low risk of bias if all domains were rated probably low risk of bias or low risk of bias. Two investigators (S.U.K and A.N.L) independently appraised the potential risks of bias and resolved the discrepancies by discussion (Appendix p 3 and 4).

### Associations of omega-3 fatty acid supplement use with cardiovascular disease risks: meta-analysis of 10 trials involving 77 917 individuals [^114BdLuM]. JAMA Cardiology (2018). Medium credibility.

The present meta-analysis reported weak evidence of heterogeneity between the results of open-label vs blind trials for any CHD. This may reflect reporting bias, chance, or greater compliance in the open-label trials than in the blinded trials.

Previous meta-analyses of omega-3 FA trials, which were limited by being incomplete, including trials of dietary advice to increase fish consumption, or failure to distinguish the effects on a wide range of subtypes of CVD. In contrast, the present meta-analysis demonstrated that omega-3 FA supplementation had no significant effect on fatal CHD or any other CVD subtypes. Moreover, the conclusions of the present meta-analysis are consistent with those of a 2016 reportfor the US Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality that also involved study-level data from the same 10 large trials for prevention of major vascular events, and concluded that omega-3 FA supplementation had no association with the risk of major vascular events, all-cause mortality, sudden cardiac death, or revascularization. In contrast with this report, the present article was able to assess effects on a wide range of subtypes of CVD and on major vascular events in all relevant subgroups.

### Omega-6 fatty acids and risk of heart failure in the physicians' health study [^111Y8inx]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Although 1 in 5 adults will develop heart failure (HF) in their lifetime, data on the effect of plasma omega-6 (n-3) PUFAs on risk of HF are currently sparse.

Objectives

We investigated whether plasma phospholipid omega-6 concentrations are associated with risk of HF in US male physicians. In a secondary analysis, we evaluated whether such an association differs between HF with and without previous myocardial infarction (MI).

Design

With the use of a nested case-control design, this ancillary study comprised 788 cases and 788 matched controls from the Physicians' Health Study. Plasma omega-6 PUFAs were measured by using gas chromatography.

Results

The mean age of subjects was 58.7 y with a mean follow-up time of 17.1 y. We did not show any evidence of a statistically significant relation between total omega-6 PUFAs and HF [OR (95% CI): 1.00; 0.85 (0.63, 1.14); 0.84 (0.63, 1.13); and 0.87 (0.63, 1.20) across consecutive quartiles of omega-6 PUFAs; P-linear trend = 0.39]. Results were similar for HF with and without previous MI.

Conclusion

Our data showed no significant association between total plasma omega-6 PUFAs and risk of developing HF.

### Emerging mechanisms of cardiovascular protection for the omega-3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid [^112w9J4F]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients with well-controlled LDL (low-density lipoprotein) levels still have residual cardiovascular risk associated with elevated triglycerides. Epidemiological studies have shown that elevated fasting triglyceride levels associate independently with incident cardiovascular events, and abundant recent human genetic data support the causality of TGRLs (triglyceride-rich lipoproteins) in atherothrombosis. Omega-3 fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), lower blood triglyceride concentrations but likely exert additional atheroprotective properties at higher doses. Omega-3 fatty acids modulate T-cell differentiation and give rise to various prostaglandins and specialized proresolving lipid mediators that promote resolution of tissue injury and inflammation. The REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl–Intervention Trial) with an EPA-only formulation lowered a composite of cardiovascular events by 25% in patients with established cardiovascular disease or diabetes mellitus and other cardiovascular risk factors. This clinical benefit likely arises from multiple molecular mechanisms discussed in this review. Indeed, human plaques readily incorporate EPA, which may render them less likely to trigger clinical events. EPA and DHA differ in their effects on membrane structure, rates of lipid oxidation, inflammatory biomarkers, and endothelial function as well as tissue distributions. Trials that have evaluated DHA-containing high-dose omega-3 fatty acids have thus far not shown the benefits of EPA alone demonstrated in REDUCE-IT. This review will consider the mechanistic evidence that helps to understand the potential mechanisms of benefit of EPA.

Comparative Biophysical and Antioxidant Properties of Omega-3 Fatty Acids

EPA and DHA have direct and indirect cellular actions that differ depending on their particular hydrocarbon length and number of double bonds. In particular, DHA has an additional double bond (6 total) and 2 more carbons compared with EPA. These structural properties influence the interactions of these 2 fatty acids with surrounding membrane lipids that, in turn, can alter membrane lipid raft formation and signal transduction pathways (Figure 3).– Based on its hydrocarbon length and number of double bonds, EPA inserts into lipoprotein particles and cellular membranes in an extended conformation where it can scavenge ROS through stabilization of the unpaired electrons by its multiple conjugated double bonds, a property known as conjugative resonance stabilization. Patients with elevated triglycerides treated with prescription EPA (2–4 g/d) have significantly reduced oxLDL levels in plasma compared with placebo.

3.2 Fish oil omega‐3 PUFAs: Background of clinical studies

A 2011 review analyzed randomized controlled trials, prospective cohort studies, and meta‐analyses conducted up to that time and concluded that consumption of fish or fish oil reduced coronary heart disease mortality in populations with and without established CV disease. 40 Three meta‐analyses of randomized controlled trials of omega‐3 PUFA supplements supported this conclusion. 46, 74, 75 However, another meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials published in 2012 concluded that omega‐3 PUFA supplementation was not associated with significant reduction in the risk of all‐cause death, cardiac death, or myocardial infarction. 76 That meta‐analysis, however, used an unusually high threshold for statistical significance (α = 0.0063). It is remarkable, for example, that all 17 of the trials included in the analysis of all‐cause death reported a relative risk < 0.96 favoring omega‐3 PUFA, and seven of those trials reported upper confidence intervals that were < 1.0, yet the meta‐analysis failed to find a significant benefit of omega‐3 PUFAs for all‐cause death. The authors noted that there was extensive heterogeneity across trials with regard to event rates, baseline CV disease risk, treatment setting (eg, primary prevention vs secondary prevention), co‐administered therapies, baseline intake of omega‐3 PUFAs, dose, and nature of omega‐3 PUFA used for the intervention, and treatment adherence. Thus, heterogeneity was likely so high that a meaningful conclusion could not be reached. A more recent meta‐analysis revealed the importance of such heterogeneity. That study 77 also found a non‐significant reduction in coronary heart disease risk across the entire study group (summary relative risk estimate [SSRE], 0.94; 95% CI 0.85‐1.05), but it found that high‐risk populations obtained significant benefits from omega‐3 PUFA interventions. Specifically, patients with elevated baseline TG levels had an SSRE of 0.86 (95% CI 0.76‐0.98). The authors also found evidence that higher intakes of omega‐3 PUFAs were associated with significantly greater reductions in coronary heart disease risk (SSRE, 0.82; 95% CI 0.74‐0.92). These meta‐analyses reinforce the importance of trial design; patient subgroups should be carefully and prospectively defined and studied in clinical trials, and doses and compositions of omega‐3 PUFAs need to be precisely constructed and controlled.

### Nutrition therapy recommendations for the management of adults with diabetes [^114CDTkC]. Diabetes Care (2013). Low credibility.

Omega-3 fatty acids

Evidence does not support recommending omega-3 (EPA and DHA) supplements for people with diabetes for the prevention or treatment of cardiovascular events. (A)
As recommended for the general public, an increase in foods containing long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) (from fatty fish) and omega-3 linolenic acid (ALA) is recommended for individuals with diabetes because of their beneficial effects on lipoproteins, prevention of heart disease, and associations with positive health outcomes in observational studies. (B)
The recommendation for the general public to eat fish (particularly fatty fish) at least two times (two servings) per week is also appropriate for people with diabetes. (B)

The ADA systematic review identified seven RCTs and one single-arm study (2002–2010) using omega-3 fatty acid supplements and one cohort study on whole-food omega-3 intake. In individuals with type 2 diabetes, supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids did not improve glycemic control, but higher-dose supplementation decreased triglycerides. Additional blood-derived markers of CVD risk were not consistently altered in these trials. In subjects with diabetes, six short-duration (30 days to 12 weeks) RCTs were published after the macronutrient review comparing omega-3 (EPA and DHA) supplements to placebo and reported minimal or no beneficial effects or mixed/inconsistent beneficial effects on CVD risk factors and other health issues (e.g. depression). Supplementation with flaxseed (32 g/day) or flaxseed oil (13 g/day) for 12 weeks did not affect glycemic control or adipokines. Three longer-duration studies (4 months; 40 months; 6.2 years) also reported mixed outcomes. Two studies reported no beneficial effects of supplementation. In one study, patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to atorvastatin or placebo and/or omega-3 supplements (2 g/day) or placebo. No differences on estimated 10-year CVD risks were observed with the addition of omega-3 fatty acid supplements compared with placebo. In the largest and longest trial, in patients with type 2 diabetes, supplementation with 1 g/day omega-3 fatty acids compared with placebo did not reduce the rate of cardiovascular events, death from any cause, or death from arrhythmia. However, in one study in postmyocardial patients with diabetes, low-dose supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids (400 mg/day) exerted a protective effect on ventricular arrhythmia–related events, and a reduction in mortality was reported. Thus, RCTs do not support recommending omega-3 supplements for primary or secondary prevention of CVD despite the strength of evidence from observational and preclinical studies.

### Circulating long-chain ω-3 fatty acids and incidence of congestive heart failure in older adults: the cardiovascular health study: a cohort study [^116xyR9Z]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Few previous studies have evaluated associations between long-chain ω-3 fatty acids and incidence of congestive heart failure (CHF), and those that have are typically based on diet questionnaires and yield conflicting results. Circulating fatty acid concentrations provide objective biomarkers of exposure.

Objective

To determine whether plasma phospholipid concentrations of long-chain ω-3 fatty acids, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosapentaenoic acid (DPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), were associated with incident CHF.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting

4 U.S. communities.

Patients

2735 U.S. adults without prevalent heart disease who were enrolled in the Cardiovascular Health Study from 1992 to 2006.

Measurements

Plasma phospholipid fatty acid concentrations and other cardiovascular risk factors were measured in 1992 by using standardized methods. Relationships with incident CHF (555 cases during 26 490 person-years, adjudicated by using medical records) were assessed by using Cox proportional hazards models.

Results

After multivariate adjustment, plasma phospholipid EPA concentration was inversely associated with incident CHF; risk was approximately 50% lower in the highest versus the lowest quartile (hazard ratio [HR], 0.52 [95% CI, 0.38 to 0.72]; P for trend = 0.001). In similar analyses, trends toward lower risk were seen for DPA (HR, 0.76 [CI, 0.56 to 1.04]; P for trend = 0.057) and total long-chain ω-3 fatty acids (HR, 0.70 [CI, 0.49 to 0.99]; P for trend = 0.062) but not for DHA (HR, 0.84 [CI, 0.58 to 1.21]; P for trend = 0.38). In analyses censored to the middle of follow-up (7 years) to minimize exposure misclassification over time, multivariate-adjusted HRs were 0.48 for EPA (CI, 0.32 to 0.71; P for trend = 0.005), 0.61 for DPA (CI, 0.39 to 0.95; P for trend = 0.033), 0.64 for DHA (CI, 0.40 to 1.04; P for trend = 0.057), and 0.51 for total ω-3 fatty acids (CI, 0.32 to 0.80; P for trend = 0.003).

Limitations

Temporal changes in fatty acid concentrations over time may have caused underestimation of associations. Unmeasured or imperfectly measured covariates may have caused residual confounding.

Conclusion

Circulating individual and total ω-3 fatty acid concentrations are associated with lower incidence of CHF in older adults.

### Trends in fatty acid intake of adults in the Minneapolis-St paul, MN metropolitan area, 1980–1982 through 2007–2009 [^115fgQVf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality have decreased in recent years due to a combination of prevention and treatment efforts. Following lifestyle recommendations and meeting standard metrics of cardiovascular health can improve CVD risk factors and decreases CVD‐related mortality risk. – Diet is an important modifiable risk factor, and the amount and type of dietary fat consumed has become one focus for dietary interventions.–

Recommendations for fatty acid intake have been issued to the public for the purposes of reducing CVD risk. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend daily total fat intake of 20% to 35% of energy intake, with saturated fatty acid (SFA) intake of < 10% of energy and trans fatty acid intake as low as possible. Similarly, the American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that intake of SFA be restricted to 5% to 6% of total energy intake and trans fatty acid intake to < 1%. – In addition, the USDA and American Heart Association recommend increasing omega‐3 intake, with a goal of consuming ≈0.25 g of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) per day. –

Is the American diet becoming more consistent with these recommendations? Data available to evaluate trends in fatty acid intake in the US population over the last several decades are limited, particularly with regard to examining changes in the trans fatty acid, DHA, and EPA content of the diet. – To contribute to the limited number of studies on this topic, the present analysis examines changes in intake of total fat and fatty acids from 1980–1982 through 2007–2009 using data on adults from the Minnesota Heart Survey.

### Diabetes mellitus, race, and effects of omega-3 fatty acids on incidence of heart Failure hospitalization [^113c1TXe]. JACC: Heart Failure (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The primary aim was to evaluate whether prevalent type 2 diabetes (T2D) modifies the effects of omega-3 supplementation on heart failure (HF) hospitalization. The secondary aim was to examine if race modifies the effects of omega-3 supplements on HF risk.

Background

It is unclear whether race and T2D modify the effects of omega-3 supplementation on the incidence of HF.

Methods

In this ancillary study of the parent VITAL (Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial)-a completed randomized trial testing the efficacy of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids on cardiovascular diseases and cancer, we assessed the role of T2D and race on the effects of omega-3 supplements on the incidence of HF hospitalization (adjudicated by a review of medical records and supplemented with a query of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data).

Results

When omega-3 supplements were compared with placebo, the HR for first HF hospitalization was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.50–0.95) in participants with prevalent T2D and 1.09 (95% CI: 0.88–1.34) in those without T2D (P for interaction = 0.019). Furthermore, prevalent T2D modified the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on the incidence of recurrent HF hospitalization (HR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.41–0.69 in participants with prevalent T2D vs HR: 1.07; 95% CI: 0.89–1.28 in those without T2D; P interaction < 0.0001). In our secondary analysis, omega-3 supplementation reduced recurrent HF hospitalization only in Black participants (P interaction race × omega-3 = 0.0497).

Conclusions

Our data show beneficial effects of omega-3 fatty acid supplements on incidence of HF hospitalization in participants with T2D but not in those without T2D, and such benefit appeared to be stronger in Black participants with T2D.

### Triglyceride-lowering and anti-inflammatory mechanisms of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids for atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk reduction [^113ikXSk]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2021). Medium credibility.

Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of death globally. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) including eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid have been extensively studied as both dietary supplement and pharmaceutical agent for the prevention of ASCVD. Epidemiological and retrospective studies have long shown the inverse relationship of omega-3 PUFA consumption and ASCVD event but results of previous large randomized controlled trials have not consistently shown the same effect. Meta-analysis and a recent clinical trial using a high dose of eicosapentaenoic acid showed convincing protective effects of omega-3 PUFAs on ASCVD. Emerging evidence shows that both chronic inflammation and hypertriglyceridemia increase the risk of atherosclerosis. Amelioration of the inflammatory process and reduction of hypertriglyceridemia provide two mechanisms on the prevention and management of ASCVD, and agents with both of these effects are more potent and desirable. Omega-3 PUFAs exert anti-hypertriglyceridemia effect, ameliorate inflammation, and maintain the resolution of inflammation homeostasis pleiotropically through multiple molecular and cellular mechanisms. This review presents the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis, the mechanisms of omega-3 PUFAs on the reduction of the atherosclerotic risk, and the current clinical utilities of omega-3 PUFAs on the prevention of ASCVD.

### Modulating biological aging with food-derived signals: a systems and precision nutrition perspective [^113doWEo]. Npj Aging (2025). Medium credibility.

This emphasizes the role of lifestyle factors in influencing biological aging, with diet, exercise, sleep quality and social interactions serving as key factors in maintaining health and slowing down biological aging. This concept is critical to understanding how we can intervene to delay aging and prevent chronic diseases. Diet is a significant factor in influencing biological age. A balanced diet rich in nutrients, such as antioxidants, fiber, and polyunsaturated fats like omega-3 fatty acids, can help slow down the progression of aging. Conversely, poor dietary choices, such as high sugar, trans -fats, and low fiber, accelerate the aging process, increasing the risk of NCDs.

A plant-based diet containing high quality protein is associated with a 15% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular diseases and a 21% reduction in coronary artery disease. Mechanistically, this is based on pathways like the inhibition of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), modulation of sirtuins, and reduced oxidative stress. Moreover, adherence to the Mediterranean diet has been linked to reduced inflammation and improved cognitive function, with studies indicating a lower risk of cognitive decline and dementia among its adherents. Vegan diets have been shown to improve glycemia and weight management for individuals with type 2 diabetes. However, plant-based diets may lack essential micronutrients like vitamin B 12, vitamin D 3, iron, calcium, and long-chain omega-3 fatty acids. Ensuring adequate intake through careful dietary planning or supplementation is essential.

Furthermore, maintaining a healthy weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise can prevent or delay many chronic conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease. Interestingly, also social engagement and strong familial ties, as seen in Blue Zone populations, contribute significantly to longevity and overall well-being. In contrast, loneliness has been associated with a poorer diet quality increasing the risk of malnutrition.

### Effect of omega-3 fatty acids on cardiovascular outcomes: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Dxps2]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Omega-3 fatty acids (FAs), such as eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids, may reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events through various mechanisms, including triglyceride (TG) lowering, membrane stabilization, and antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory, or antiarrhythmic properties. Consequently, randomized controlled trials explored the cardiovascular effects of omega-3 FAs with considerable interest. The JELIS (the JAPAN EPA Lipid Intervention Study) trialshowed a reduction in major coronary events in patients with hypercholesteremia using purified EPA. However, the study was limited by open-label design, lack of placebo group, the inclusion of potentially subjective endpoints in the primary composite outcome (e.g. unstable angina and elective revascularization), and lower intensity of statin therapy in participants with average low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of ~180 mg/dL at baseline.

In 2018, three randomized controlled trials examining different preparations of omega-3 FAs showed divergent results. The ASCEND (A Study of Cardiovascular Events in Diabetes)and VITAL (Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial) trialsusing EPA+DHA did not significantly reduce the primary cardiovascular endpoints (ASCEND: non-fatal myocardial infarction [MI] or ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or vascular death excluding confirmed intracranial hemorrhage; VITAL: MI, stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes). Conversely, REDUCE-IT (Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention Trial)showed a significant 25% relative reduction in the primary composite efficacy endpoint of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or unstable angina (an absolute reduction of 4.8%) with icosapent ethyl — a highly purified ethyl ester of EPA — in patients with established ASCVD or those with high risk for ASCVD (diabetes with at least one additional risk factor). The key secondary endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI, or stroke was significantly reduced by 26%, and death from cardiovascular causes was significantly reduced by 20%.

### Omega-3 fatty acids and atrial fibrillation… [^113zWY6F]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

In the past 2 years, 4 randomized clinical trials have provided data on the risk of AF with omega-3 fatty acid intake. In the STRENGTH trial, 3 13 078 high-risk patients with cardiovascular disease were randomized to receive a high dose, 4 g/d, of a carboxylic acid formulation of omega-3 fatty acids or corn oil. After a median of 42 months, there was no significant difference between the 2 randomized groups in the primary composite cardiovascular end point, but there was an increase in risk of developing AF in the omega-3 fatty acids group compared with the corn oil group. In the REDUCE-IT trial, 4 8179 participants were randomized to a high dose of an omega-3 fatty acid preparation consisting of purified EPA or mineral oil. After a median follow-up of 4.

9 years, icosapent ethyl resulted in a 25% relative reduction in the primary composite cardiovascular end point compared with mineral oil. In a third clinical trial, OMEMI, 5 1027 older patients who had had a recent myocardial infarction were randomized to receive an intermediate dose, 1. 8 g/d, of omega-3 fatty acids or corn oil. In the VITAL Rhythm Study, 2 published in this issue of JAMA, 12 542 participants were randomized to receive a standard dose of omega-3 fatty acids, 840 mg/d and 12 557 to receive placebo. With an intermediate dose of 1. 8 g/d, the increase in risk did not achieve statistical significance, and with a standard daily dose of 840 mg/d, there was no apparent increase in risk.

Patients who choose to take omega-3 fatty acids, especially in high doses, should be informed of the risk of AF and followed up for the possible development of this common and potentially hazardous arrhythmia.
