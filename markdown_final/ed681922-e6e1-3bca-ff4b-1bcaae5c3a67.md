## Question

How do you approach rib fracture

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to approach rib fracture management. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about initial assessment and risk stratification. Then, I should verify imaging strategy and how it changes management. Next, I will examine pain control and pulmonary hygiene, including regional anesthesia. After that, I need to consider indications and timing for surgical stabilization. Then, I should review special populations, especially older adults. Finally, I will synthesize disposition and follow-up, and close with a concise algorithm that aligns with current guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the initial assessment priorities: airway, breathing, circulation, and identification of life-threatening thoracic injuries such as tension pneumothorax, massive hemothorax, flail chest, and pulmonary contusion, because these drive immediate interventions and level of care. I should also quantify risk using the number of ribs fractured, age, cardiopulmonary comorbidity, and injury pattern, since mortality and complications rise with three or more ribs, age over 65, and flail chest, and these factors guide ICU admission and analgesic intensity [^114dLHtU] [^112JGcMM] [^111h97zq].

> Wait, let me verify the imaging approach before I over-order CT. For most stable patients with suspected rib fractures, a chest radiograph is usually sufficient to diagnose fractures and detect pneumothorax or hemothorax; CT is reserved for high-risk patients, those with three or more ribs, suspected flail, or when surgical planning is anticipated, because CT changes management in a meaningful subset and surgeons often grade displacement more severely than radiologists, which can alter SSRF decisions [^113Jt7Rh] [^112Rd3SL].

> I need to ensure pain control is addressed immediately and aggressively, since pain drives splinting, atelectasis, and pneumonia. Multimodal analgesia with scheduled acetaminophen and NSAIDs is foundational, adding muscle relaxants when appropriate, and escalating to regional anesthesia or opioids as needed; neuraxial techniques are preferred in high-risk patients when not contraindicated, with paravertebral or intercostal blocks as alternatives when epidural is unsafe, and emerging plane blocks like ESP or SAP are promising adjuncts [^115Jeywp] [^111LpETA] [^112P4UzG] [^111TLvQm].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about opioids; I should double-check the balance of benefit and risk, especially in older adults. While opioids can be effective for breakthrough pain, they increase delirium, respiratory depression, and falls, so I should minimize narcotics and prioritize regional anesthesia and non-opioid strategies whenever feasible, documenting functional goals tied to pain control to justify escalation [^115Jeywp] [^111LpETA].

> Next, I should review pulmonary hygiene and respiratory support, because preventing atelectasis and pneumonia is central. Incentive spirometry, cough coaching, and early mobilization are essential; in patients with flail or respiratory compromise, noninvasive ventilation can reduce intubation rates, and in ventilated patients with flail chest, lung-protective strategies with adequate PEEP are standard, with early extubation when feasible to reduce complications [^115GRRH2] [^115XDkD9].

> I will now examine indications for surgical stabilization of rib fractures, and I need to be precise here. Strong recommendations support SSRF for flail chest, particularly when failing nonoperative management or requiring ventilation, with benefits including reduced mortality, ventilator days, ICU and hospital length of stay, and pneumonia; SSRF is also reasonable for multiple severely displaced ribs, especially ribs 3–10, and for persistent pain or respiratory compromise despite optimized multimodal therapy, with timing ideally within 72 hours when feasible [^114vQXkG] [^113HHty9] [^1133phmW] [^111tQDEo] [^116uTgXM].

> But wait, what if the patient has non-flail multiple rib fractures without severe displacement; should I still operate? The evidence is weaker here, and guidelines advise individualized decisions based on pain refractory to maximal therapy, functional impairment, and center expertise; I should confirm that nonoperative optimization has been exhausted and that the local team has experience with SSRF before proceeding, recognizing that some contemporary studies suggest potential benefits even outside classic flail indications, though high-quality RCT data remain limited [^1135Hd1w] [^112Ph74q] [^112H3NUv].

> Let me consider special populations, especially older adults, because age modifies risk and thresholds for intervention. Patients over 65 have 2–5 fold higher mortality and complication rates, so I should have a lower threshold for ICU admission, regional anesthesia, and early SSRF when indicated; frailty assessment can refine risk, and geriatric co-management helps address comorbidities and rehabilitation needs, with some centers admitting patients aged 65 or older with three or more ribs directly to the ICU as part of a bundled protocol [^111h97zq] [^1131YNiC] [^1152Jyjg] [^113XixH4].

> I should confirm disposition criteria and follow-up, and I need to check whether FVC-guided pathways are safe in the ED. An FVC threshold around 1500 mL, in the absence of hemothorax, pneumothorax, or bilateral fractures, has been associated with safe discharge when combined with adequate analgesia and reliable follow-up, though adherence to measuring FVC can be challenging and pain control remains the most common reason for return, so I must ensure a robust pain plan and clear return precautions before discharge [^114XRTi3] [^111zNjtE] [^113fE7Tf].

> Next, I should review postoperative care after SSRF to avoid preventable complications. Early mobilization, aggressive pulmonary hygiene with scheduled incentive spirometry and cough support, and multimodal analgesia with scheduled non-narcotics and regional techniques are recommended; follow-up chest radiography at 1–2 weeks and assessment for hardware issues or infection are standard, and patients should be counseled on activity restrictions and pain expectations during recovery [^116Se4AB] [^114kKuYu] [^114wtpbp].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm without oversimplifying. High-risk features such as flail chest, three or more ribs with severe displacement, respiratory compromise, or age over 65 with multiple ribs push toward ICU-level care, early regional anesthesia, and consideration of SSRF; intermediate-risk patients warrant admission with multimodal analgesia and close respiratory monitoring; low-risk patients with one or two non-displaced ribs, good pain control, and no pneumothorax or hemothorax may be discharged with strict return precautions and analgesic follow-up, recognizing that local protocols and patient reliability should guide final disposition [^114dLHtU] [^115Jeywp] [^114XRTi3].

> Finally, I should double-check that my approach aligns with evidence-based practices shown to improve outcomes. Adherence to neuraxial blockade in older adults with multiple ribs, SSRF for flail chest, ICU admission for high-risk patients, and tube thoracostomy for pneumothorax or hemothorax are associated with reduced mortality, yet real-world adherence remains modest; implementing standardized protocols and multidisciplinary pathways can mitigate this gap and translate evidence into better patient outcomes [^1172gaTR].

Rib fractures are managed with a **multidisciplinary, protocolized approach** that prioritizes **pain control**, **pulmonary hygiene**, and **early mobilization** to prevent complications [^1135ZQi1] [^115Jeywp]. Most patients are managed nonoperatively with **multimodal analgesia** (acetaminophen, NSAIDs, regional anesthesia) and aggressive respiratory therapy; **surgical stabilization** is reserved for flail chest, severe displacement, or failure of nonoperative care [^115Jeywp] [^1133phmW]. Early regional anesthesia (epidural or paravertebral) reduces pain, improves ventilation, and lowers pneumonia risk, especially in older adults or those with multiple fractures [^115Jeywp] [^111TLvQm]. Patients with ≥ 3 ribs, age ≥ 65, or cardiopulmonary disease should be admitted for monitoring and escalated care; discharge is appropriate only with adequate pain control, no respiratory compromise, and reliable follow-up [^111LpETA] [^114XRTi3]. Chronic pain or nonunion may require surgical fixation or pain clinic referral [^1167QUSY] [^1149rNY7].

---

## Initial assessment and risk stratification

- **Airway, breathing, circulation (ABC)**: Stabilize life threats first [^notfound].
- **Number and pattern of fractures**: ≥ 3 ribs, flail chest, bilateral fractures, or first rib fractures indicate higher risk [^112JGcMM] [^11673F6b].
- **Patient factors**: Age ≥ 65, cardiopulmonary disease, and frailty increase morbidity and mortality [^111h97zq] [^1131YNiC] [^1152Jyjg].
- **Associated injuries**: Pneumothorax, hemothorax, pulmonary contusion, and head/abdominal injuries are common and worsen outcomes [^114hSPpJ] [^112JGcMM].

---

## Imaging and diagnostic evaluation

- **Chest radiograph**: First-line to detect fractures and complications (pneumothorax, hemothorax) [^113Jt7Rh].
- **Chest CT**: Gold standard for detailed fracture mapping, displacement, and internal organ injury; guides SSRF decisions [^112Rd3SL] [^116RUcwq].
- **Ultrasound**: Useful for bedside detection of pneumothorax/hemothorax and pleural effusions [^notfound].

---

## Pain management

Pain control is critical to enable breathing and prevent **atelectasis and pneumonia** [^111LpETA].

| **Analgesic modality** | **Indications** | **Benefits** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Acetaminophen | All patients | Safe, opioid-sparing | Hepatic toxicity at high doses |
| NSAIDs | Most patients | Effective, opioid-sparing | GI bleeding, renal impairment |
| Opioids | Severe pain | Potent analgesia | Respiratory depression, sedation, constipation |
| Epidural anesthesia | ≥ 3 ribs, flail chest, elderly | Superior pain control, improved ventilation, reduced pneumonia | Hypotension, contraindications (coagulopathy, spine instability) |
| Paravertebral block | Alternative to epidural | Effective, fewer hemodynamic effects | Technical expertise required |
| Intercostal nerve blocks | Localized pain | Effective, minimal systemic effects | Repeated injections, pneumothorax risk |

---

## Respiratory management

- **Incentive spirometry**: Encourage 10–15 reps every 1–2 hours while awake [^notfound].
- **Coughing and deep breathing**: Essential to prevent atelectasis and pneumonia [^116Se4AB].
- **Non-invasive ventilation**: Consider for flail chest or respiratory compromise to reduce intubation risk [^notfound].
- **Mechanical ventilation**: Use lung-protective strategies for flail chest or respiratory failure [^notfound].

---

## Indications for surgical stabilization (SSRF)

SSRF is indicated for select patients after **nonoperative optimization** [^1133phmW]:

- **Flail chest**: Especially with respiratory compromise or failure to wean from ventilation [^114vQXkG] [^113HHty9].
- **Severe displacement**: Multiple, severely displaced ribs (≥ 3) with impaired mechanics [^1133phmW] [^113HHty9].
- **Failure of nonoperative care**: Persistent pain or respiratory compromise despite maximal therapy [^117P3YmE] [^114JfSgP].
- **Chronic nonunion**: Disabling pain refractory to conservative care [^1167QUSY] [^1149rNY7].

---

## Timing of surgery

Early fixation within **48–72 hours** reduces ventilator days, ICU stay, pneumonia, and mortality; delayed fixation (> 7 days) is less beneficial and may increase complications [^111tQDEo] [^113sKLgS].

---

## Postoperative care and rehabilitation

Postoperative care emphasizes **multimodal analgesia**, aggressive pulmonary hygiene, and early mobilization; physical therapy restores chest wall mechanics and function, and follow-up should monitor for infection, hardware failure, and nonunion [^114kKuYu] [^112afZtt] [^114wtpbp].

---

## Complications and outcomes

- **Pulmonary complications**: Pneumonia, atelectasis, respiratory failure are common, especially in elderly or multiple fractures [^111h97zq] [^1131YNiC].
- **Chronic pain**: Occurs in ~20–50% and may require SSRF or pain clinic referral [^notfound].
- **Nonunion**: Rare but may cause persistent pain and disability; consider SSRF [^1167QUSY] [^1149rNY7].
- **Mortality**: Increases with age, number of ribs, and cardiopulmonary disease; early, protocolized care reduces mortality [^111h97zq] [^112JGcMM] [^1172gaTR].

---

## Special considerations

In older adults, **mortality and complications are higher**; use lower thresholds for admission, regional anesthesia, and SSRF [^111h97zq] [^1131YNiC]. In pediatric patients, conservative management is preferred due to high healing potential; SSRF is rarely indicated. For patients with multiple trauma, coordinate with other teams and tailor analgesia to injuries and hemodynamics [^115Jeywp].

---

## Follow-up and discharge planning

Discharge is appropriate when pain is controlled, there is no respiratory compromise, and reliable follow-up is assured; arrange **primary care or trauma follow-up** in 1–2 weeks, provide incentive spirometry and activity guidance, and counsel on red flags (dyspnea, fever, worsening pain) [^114XRTi3] [^114wtpbp].

---

A structured approach to rib fractures — with **risk stratification**, **multimodal analgesia**, **respiratory care**, and **selective SSRF** — improves outcomes. Early regional anesthesia and protocolized care are key, especially in older adults or those with multiple fractures [^1135ZQi1] [^115Jeywp].

This is a recommended management algorithm from the Western Trauma Association addressing the management of adult patients with rib fractures. Because there is a paucity of published prospective randomized clinical trials that have generated Class I data, these recommendations are based primarily on published observational studies and expert opinion of Western Trauma Association members. The algorithm and accompanying comments represent a safe and sensible approach that can be followed at most trauma centers. We recognize that there will be patient, personnel, institutional, and situational factors that may warrant or require deviation from the recommended algorithm. We encourage institutions to use this as a guideline to develop their own local protocols.

### Emergency department management of patients with rib fracture based on a clinical practice guideline [^111Q1Pmk]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Blunt mechanism accounts for the majority of trauma in most centers and for > 15% of emergency department (ED) trauma visits worldwide. Approximately 35% of blunt trauma patients are diagnosed with one or more rib fractures. The risk of pulmonary complications such as pneumonia, pulmonary effusion, atelectasis and lobar collapse is drastically increased in patients with rib fractures. It has been widely documented that mortality rates in patients with rib fractures are high for young adults (10%) and even higher for the elderly (22%). Patients with chest wall injury are managed by surgical and emergency medicine teams that use protocols to dictate interventions and disposition. Decision-making in patients with severe blunt trauma and rib fractures is less complicated if mechanical ventilation or emergent surgical intervention is required. When injuries are less severe, it becomes difficult to decipher who may require more aggressive management and who is appropriate for discharge from the ED. Symptoms are insufficient to determine appropriate discharge. Additionally, symptoms are not considered accurate in predicting the outcome and morbidity in patients with thoracic trauma. There are no current nationally recognized clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the management in this population.

Summary

Rib fractures are important indicators of injury severity, and patients with multiple rib fractures carry high risk of morbidity and mortality. Based on the existing literature, we recommend a comprehensive and standardized management algorithm, such as our institutional bundled care pathway presented here, including consideration of catheter-based analgesia, multimodal pain management, respiratory therapy interventions, and frequent reevaluation.

### Emergency department management of patients with rib fracture based on a clinical practice guideline [^114XRTi3]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

The blunt trauma patient with rib fractures can present with few or no respiratory symptoms, but within 48–72 hours associated respiratory complications can develop. A CPG enables physicians to use an accepted algorithmic approach to patient care. That model can then be used to place patients into risk categories of a prespecified outcome. Current CPGs and prognostic models that exist for blunt chest trauma are mostly intended for use in patients with multiple injuries. It remains a difficult task to determine the appropriateness of discharging a patient with non-life-threatening blunt chest trauma with rib fractures.

The forced vital capacity (FVC) is a well-known physiological quantitative parameter used widely to assess pulmonary function. At our institution, a CPG based on FVC for rib fractures was developed as a tool for triage of these patients. The CPG being tested was created and implemented in September 2013. The algorithm is based on three components: early bedside FVC, early analgesia and early identification of respiratory compromise. The components are centered around the goal of early identification of rib fractures and use of FVC as a guide to determine appropriate triage. The inpatient arm of this CPG was validated and was shown to decreased hospital length of stay by 2 days in patients admitted to the intensive care unit. An arm of this CPG was developed for discharge from the ED in patients with FVC > 1500 mL, two or fewer unilateral fractures in the absence of hemothorax or pneumothorax, and after ensuring adequate pain control is eligible for discharge(figure 1) The objectives of this study were to assess the safety, efficacy and adherence of providers with this rib fracture CPG. We hypothesize that trauma patients who meet the criteria for discharge using the rib fracture CPG could be safely discharged from the ED.

Summary

Although nonoperative management is the mainstay for rib fracture treatment, surgical stabilization of rib fractures is becoming more common. Recently, the number of high-quality studies on management of rib fractures has also increased. The primary purpose of this review is to analyze the currently available prospective randomized studies on the management of rib fractures. In addition, we will summarize both short-term and long-term outcomes of patients with rib fractures.

### Comprehensive approach to the management of the patient with multiple rib fractures: a review and introduction of a bundled rib fracture management protocol [^115WSSHk]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Rib fractures are common among patients sustaining blunt trauma, and are markers of severe bodily and solid organ injury. They are associated with high morbidity and mortality, including multiple pulmonary complications, and can lead to chronic pain and disability. Clinical and radiographic scoring systems have been developed at several institutions to predict risk of complications. Clinical strategies to reduce morbidity have been studied, including multimodal pain management, catheter-based analgesia, pulmonary hygiene, and operative stabilization. In this article, we review risk factors for morbidity and complications, intervention strategies, and discuss experience with bundled clinical pathways for rib fractures. In addition, we introduce the multidisciplinary rib fracture management protocol used at our level I trauma center.

### New horizons in rib fracture management in the older adult [^111h97zq]. Age and Ageing (2020). Medium credibility.

Adults aged ≥ 60 years now represent the majority of patients presenting with major trauma. Falls are the most common cause of injury, accounting for nearly three-quarters of all traumas in this population. Trauma to the thorax represents the second most common site of injury in this population, and is often associated with other serious injuries. Mortality rates are 2–5 times higher in older adults compared to their younger counterparts, often despite equivalent injury severity scores. Risk scoring systems have been developed to identify rib fracture patients at high risk of deterioration. Overall mortality from rib fractures is high, at approximately 10% for all ages. Mortality and morbidity from rib fractures primarily derive from pain-induced hypoventilation, pneumonia and respiratory failure. The main goal of care is therefore to provide sufficient analgesia to allow respiratory rehabilitation and prevent pulmonary complications. The provision of analgesia has evolved to incorporate novel regional anaesthesia techniques into conventional multimodal analgesia. Analgesia algorithms may aid early aggressive management and escalation of pain control. The current role for surgical fixation of rib fractures remains unclear for older adults who have been underrepresented in the research literature. Older adults with rib fractures often have multi-morbidity and frailty which complicate their injuries. Trauma services are evolving, and increasingly geriatricians will be embedded into trauma services to deliver comprehensive geriatric assessment. This review aims to provide an evidence-based overview of the management of rib fractures for the physician treating older patients who have sustained trauma.

### Perioperative considerations for patients undergoing surgical stabilization of rib fractures: a narrative review [^117XDTmx]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) has become an increasingly common management strategy for traumatic rib fractures. Although historically managed with supportive care, patients with multiple rib fractures and flail chest increasingly undergo SSRF, and so the anesthesiologist must be well-versed in the perioperative management and pain control for these patients, as controlling pain in this population is associated with decreased length of stay and improved outcomes. There are multiple modalities that can be used for both pain control and as part of the anesthetic plan in patients undergoing SSRF. This narrative review provides a comprehensive summary of anesthetic considerations for surgical rib fracture patients, covering the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative periods. We describe an approach to the assessment of high-risk patients, analgesic and anesthetic techniques including emerging techniques within locoregional anesthesia, ventilation strategies, and potential complications. This review also identifies areas where additional research is needed to ensure optimal anesthetic management for patients undergoing SSRF.

Evidence-based therapeutic interventions

Given the multiple complications associated with rib fractures, several evidence-based strategies have been advocated for risk mitigation. Appropriate analgesia and early aggressive care appears to attenuate the development of pulmonary complicationsthrough enhancement of patients' functional capacity such as reducing splinting and improving pulmonary function.

Catheter-based analgesia

Catheter-based analgesia, including epidural and paravertebral nerve catheters, may be beneficial in patients with multiple rib fractures. Epidural analgesia has been associated with lower mortality in elderly and young adult patients, and there is thought that it could reduce complications through improved clearance of secretions, maintenance of pulmonary function, reduced atelectasis from splinting, and greater ease in weaning from the ventilator. A recent joint practice management guideline from the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) and Trauma Anesthesiology Society provided recommendations regarding catheter-based analgesia in adult patients with blunt thoracic trauma. Epidural analgesia was conditionally recommended over non-regional modalities given, although the quality of evidence was found to be poor. They found that the included studies were mixed as to findings regarding mortality benefit, and meta-analysis showed no significant difference. Assessed studies included a randomized trial with 46 patients randomized to receive epidural versus systemic opioids, where patients in the epidural group had improved pain control, lower frequency of pneumonia, shorter ventilator duration, and similar ICU LOS and mortality. Another assessed study using data from the National Study on Cost and Outcomes of Trauma database found that patients who received epidural catheters were more likely to be treated in trauma centers, had lower odds of death at 30, 90, and 365 days compared with propensity-matched controls.

### Expert consensus guidance on respiratory physiotherapy and rehabilitation of patients with rib fractures: an international, multidisciplinary e-Delphi study [^116dxdRK]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The use of surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) for the treatment of blunt chest wall trauma, as well as supporting research, has increased exponentially over the last 10 years. The role of the physiotherapist in the management of this cohort, however, has not yet been fully investigated, other than one recent study that concluded that a specific physiotherapy protocol for patients undergoing SSRF appeared to be feasible and safe. They further reported a significant decrease in patient-perceived disability, improved shoulder strength, chest expansion, and spirometry compared with immediate postoperative levels.

As a result of this minimal evidence base, there is a lack of understanding across the multidisciplinary team of the potential impact of physiotherapy. Until this gap in the literature is filled, investment in physiotherapy will be difficult to achieve, and a lack of consensus regarding optimal management strategies will exist. The overall aim of this study is to provide consensus until the evidence base is improved, through answering the research question: what are the key recommendations for the physiotherapy management of patients with rib fractures?

Introduction

Fracture patterns and clinical outcomes

Rib fractures occur in ∼9–10% of patients with trauma, and are markers of severe bodily and solid organ injury. In addition to being associated with concomitant thoracic injuries, rib fractures are associated with head, extremity, abdominal, and blunt cardiac injuries. These patients have poor overall clinical outcomes, and are at increased risk for multiple complications. Thoracic complications of rib fractures are common, including pneumonia, pulmonary effusion, aspiration, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), pulmonary emboli, and atelectasis or lobar collapse; these are important as targeted interventions may enable risk reductions. An evaluation of the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) from 1994 to 2003 identified a mortality rate of 10% and a 13% complication rate, of which 48% were pulmonary complications. Among 711 patients at a level II trauma center, 45% of patients with rib fracture experienced complications, including 35% sustaining pulmonary complications. In addition, 34% were discharged to a long-term care facility and 12% died; pulmonary complications accounted for 54% of late deaths within this population.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaRib fractures [^113Jt7Rh]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Rib fractures are the most common thoracic injury after minor blunt trauma. Although rib fractures can produce significant morbidity, the diagnosis of injuries to underlying organs is arguably more important as these complications are likely to have the most significant clinical impact. Isolated rib fractures have a relatively low morbidity and mortality and treatment is generally conservative. As such, evaluation with standard chest radiographs is usually sufficient for the diagnosis of rib fractures, and further imaging is generally not appropriate as there is little data that undiagnosed isolated rib fractures after minor blunt trauma affect management or outcomes. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation frequently results in anterior rib fractures and chest radiographs are usually appropriate (and sufficient) as the initial imaging modality in these patients. In patients with suspected pathologic fractures, chest CT or Tc-99m bone scans are usually appropriate and complementary modalities to chest radiography based on the clinical scenario. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Contemporary management of patients with multiple rib fractures: what you need to know [^114dLHtU]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Ten percent of all injured patients and 55% of patients with blunt chest trauma experience rib fractures. The incidence of death due to rib fractures is related to the number of fractured ribs, severity of fractured ribs, and patient age and comorbid conditions. Death due to rib fracture is mostly caused by pneumonia because of inability to expectorate and take deep breaths. Over the last 25 to 30 years, there has been renewed interest in surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF), known colloquially as "rib plating". This review will present what you need to know in regard to triage decisions on whether to admit a patient to the hospital, the location to which they should be admitted, criteria and evidentiary support for SSRF, timing to SSRF, and operative technique. The review also addresses the cost-effectiveness of this operation and stresses nonoperative treatment modalities that should be implemented prior to operation.

### Pain management for hospitalized patients with rib fractures: a systematic review of randomized clinical trials [^111TLvQm]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Rib fractures (RF) are common injuries. Multiple analgesia strategies are available for treatment of pain associated with RF. However, the optimal multimodal technique for pain management is not known. The primary aim of this review was to evaluate the status of evidence derived from randomized clinical trials (RCTs) on the effectiveness of pain management modalities for rib fracture pain. Other patient-centered outcomes were secondary objectives.

Methods

Searches were conducted in MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane Library. The screening process involved two phases, two researchers independently screened the title and abstract and subsequently screened full text. RCT data were extracted independently by two research team members. Consensus was achieved by comparison and discussion when needed. Risk of bias assessment was performed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool.

Results

A total of 1344 citations were identified. Title and abstract screening excluded 1128 citations, and full text review excluded 177 articles. A total of 32 RCTs were included in the full review. Multiple analgesia techniques and medications were identified and their effect on pain score and need for rescue opioid analgesia. None of the included studies were judged to have a high risk of bias, while only 10 studies were assessed as having a low risk of bias.

Conclusions

This systematic review found that studies are of low quality with diverse methodologies and outcomes. A reduction in pain scores was found for epidural analgesia when compared with other modalities. However, the low quality of the evidence necessitates cautious interpretation of this finding. PROSPERO registration: CRD42022376298 (Nov, 16, 2022).

### Rib fixation: who, what, when? [^1171frRT]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Rib fractures are among the most common traumatic injury found in ∼20% of all patients who suffer thoracic trauma. The majority of these are a result of a blunt mechanism and are often associated with other traumatic injuries. The most common associated injury is lung contusion. Rib fractures impart an increased morbidity and mortality with the highest mortality associated with a flail chest in the elderly population. Flail chest is defined radiographically as 3 or more consecutive ribs fractured in 2 or more places. This often translates to a clinical flail which is associated with paradoxical chest wall movement during respiratory cycles. The mainstay of treatment has been pain control and respiratory support with positive pressure ventilation. However, over the past 2 decades, there has been mounting evidence to suggest that open reduction and internal fixation of ribs benefits patients. The indications remain confined to the most severely injured patients with flail chest or chronic non-unions; however, there remains debate whether or not less severely injured patients would benefit as well. This article will review the current evidence and provide proposed indications based on available evidence and current expert opinion.

Rib fractures are a common injury following blunt thoracic trauma, often resulting in high levels of morbidity and mortality. With the ageing global population, the incidence of rib fractures is expected to increase, posing a significant burden on healthcare systems worldwide. With advancements in surgical techniques and pioneering research on the topic the use of surgical stabilisation of rib fractures (SSRF) has increased significantly over the past two decades. However, the relationship between certain prognostic factors and patient outcomes following surgery is still contested and there lacks a consensus on definitive indications for the operation. This literature review presents the current research on SSRF outcomes for; patients with flail chest injuries and multiple-non flail rib fractures, optimal timing between injury and operation, and patient age. This article contributes to the ongoing dialogue surrounding chest wall trauma management and may be drawn upon to aid future research and develop clinical practice guidelines.

### Surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF): the WSES and CWIS position paper [^116RUcwq]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Rib fractures are one of the most common traumatic injuries and may result in significant morbidity and mortality. Despite growing evidence, technological advances and increasing acceptance, surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) remains not uniformly considered in trauma centers. Indications, contraindications, appropriate timing, surgical approaches and utilized implants are part of an ongoing debate. The present position paper, which is endorsed by the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES), and supported by the Chest Wall Injury Society, aims to provide a review of the literature investigating the use of SSRF in rib fracture management to develop graded position statements, providing an updated guide and reference for SSRF.

Methods

This position paper was developed according to the WSES methodology. A steering committee performed the literature review and drafted the position paper. An international panel of experts then critically revised the manuscript and discussed it in detail, to develop a consensus on the position statements.

Results

A total of 287 studies (systematic reviews, randomized clinical trial, prospective and retrospective comparative studies, case series, original articles) have been selected from an initial pool of 9928 studies. Thirty-nine graded position statements were put forward to address eight crucial aspects of SSRF: surgical indications, contraindications, optimal timing of surgery, preoperative imaging evaluation, rib fracture sites for surgical fixation, management of concurrent thoracic injuries, surgical approach, stabilization methods and material selection.

Conclusion

This consensus document addresses the key focus questions on surgical treatment of rib fractures. The expert recommendations clarify current evidences on SSRF indications, timing, operative planning, approaches and techniques, with the aim to guide clinicians in optimizing the management of rib fractures, to improve patient outcomes and direct future research.

### Emergency department management of patients with rib fracture based on a clinical practice guideline [^112SkusP]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

CPGs are designed to reduce inappropriate practice and improve efficiency of care. Physician surveys have shown high satisfaction with CPGs and a belief that they improve quality of care.CPGs are often attributed to the increase in efficiency in streamlining decision-making processes. There is minimal evidence concerning the impact of rib fracture CPGs, especially for all adult trauma patients irrespective of age. There are clinical pathways for subsets of patients with rib fracture that have shown impact in reducing hospital and intensive care unit LOS. This study has verified the safety of a CPG for predicting discharge criteria based on FVC.

This CPG is composed of three components: early measurement of FVC, early identification of respiratory compromise from rib fractures and adequacy of analgesia. The CPG uses an algorithm to stratify patients with rib fractures based on FVC measurements, number of fractures and age. The current study had 92% of patients with an FVC of at least 1500 mL with the majority safely discharged without returning to the ED (88%). Fewer patients had hemothorax, pneumothorax or bilateral fractures (4%), and usually these patients are admitted for aggressive pulmonary hygiene and pain control. Occasionally, these patients may be discharged, but that should be done on a case-by-case basis after consultation with trauma services. A CPG is only useful, however, if it is clinically applicable and easy for clinicians to use. The first obstacle to applying this CPG is actually obtaining the measured FVC. A robust educational effort is under way for the ED providers about the CPG. Additionally, the hospital has increased the dedicated respiratory therapists present in the ED to assist with this algorithm. The component of the algorithm that providers followed the least was the absolute number of fractures ≤ 2. Interestingly, an increase in the number of rib fractures did not result in a higher return rate to the ED. This will be excluded from future versions of this CPG.

This study found that the most common reason for return was inadequate pain control. Due to the current opioid epidemic, there is likely hesitancy among providers to prescribe large amounts of opioid medications for pain control in any patient populations including patients with rib fracture. Including a pain control protocol in our CPG may increase provider comfort with prescribing appropriate amounts of opiates or alternatives to patients with rib fractures and further reduce return visits to the ED.

Pain control in patients with rib fracture has been shown to improve pulmonary function and prevent complications. Rib fractures lead to somatic chest pain that is associated with self-imposed limitation of tidal volume during inspiration and decrease in forceful exhalation to remove secretions. This impairs pulmonary mechanics leading to atelectasis and pneumonia. For hospitalized patients, epidural anesthetics and intercostal nerve blockade have been shown to be equal in reduction of pain and improve patient outcome after rib fractures. Generally, multimodal pain management is preferred. There is scarce research concerning pain management in patients with rib fracture who are discharged from the ED. There have been case reports of treating patients with multiple rib fractures with a paravertebral catheter in an outpatient setting, but there is no current practice guideline or recommendation.

In addition, there was no significant difference in postoperative pulmonary complications on the EAST guidelines' meta-analysis. In pooled data, they found that epidural analgesia was associated with lower pain scores at 24 and 48 hours, but not at 72 hours; in addition, epidural was associated with fewer ventilator days albeit higher odds of requiring mechanical ventilation, shorter ICU LOS, and no reduction in overall hospital LOS. Overall, there was limited data from randomized controlled trials, variable study quality, and heterogeneous data. The authors note that specific populations may derive greater benefit.

Although these data suggest that epidural may be beneficial in patients with multiple rib fractures, patients with multisystem trauma may have contraindications. Epidural-related sympathetic blockade with anesthetic agents may lead to hypotension, which can be problematic in patients with unstable hemodynamics and/or competing injuries. In addition, patients with rib fractures may have concomitant thoracic spine injury, which present a technical contraindication to epidural placement. Low molecular weight heparin is the recommended thromboembolic prophylactic agent in most patients with multisystem trauma, given high risk of thromboembolic complications; however, is not recommended while epidural catheters are inserted or removed, given risk for epidural hematoma development. Patients with thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy may be similarly inappropriate candidates. Ultimately, thoughtful consideration of prophylactic timing, concomitant trauma and individual patient risk factors is warranted.

In the context of these potential contraindications, other regional anesthesia techniques have been considered. The EAST guidelines also assessed paravertebral nerve blockade, continuous intrapleural infusions and continuous intercostal infusions but found insufficient studies to make recommendations. In one study, which compared paravertebral nerve block to epidural among 30 patients, there was no significant difference in pain control between groups. Frequency of complications and hospital LOS was similar in the two groups.

A previous EAST Practice Management Guidelines Work Group published pain management guidelines for blunt thoracic trauma, providing level I recommendations in favor of epidural over narcotic analgesia to reduce subjective pain perception as well as improvement in pulmonary function, suggesting that epidural should be the preferred technique after blunt thoracic trauma. Level II recommendations suggested epidural for patients with ≥ 4 rib fractures or age ≥ 65 unless contraindicated, as well as for younger patients if not contraindicated. Additionally, there was level II data to support decreased ventilator days, ICU LOS and hospital LOS with epidural compared with narcotic, and regarding the utility of paravertebral or extrapleural infusions to improve pain and possibly pulmonary function.

### To fix or let them flail: the who, what and when of rib fixation [^112U3Lt2]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Rib fractures are a common traumatic injury and are associated with high morbidity and mortality. For decades, the primary management of rib fractures relied on conservative management including pain control, respiratory hygiene and physical therapy without a substantial improvement in outcomes. The paradigm is shifting, however, as more and more patients are undergoing SSRF with advancing technologies that allow for safer and more effective surgeries. Particularly in patients with FC, unstable chest walls, inability to wean from a ventilator, non-union or chronic pain, SSRF has demonstrated benefits in mortality, ICU LOS and pain control. Although the data are currently limited, the literature continues to expand the scope of indications for SSRF. As technology in polymer chemistry advances, the material utilized for SSRF continues to improve as well. This review offers an overview of indications, contraindications and main points to consider for SSRF and hopes to guide physicians and direct future research as it pertains to the surgical management of rib fractures.

### Acute pain management of rib fractures: a narrative review [^112P4UzG]. Injury (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Rib fractures are common conditions often associated with significant complications, including respiratory failure, pneumonia, prolonged hospitalisation, and chronic pain. Adequate pain management is crucial to improve outcomes and reduce morbidity in these patients. Despite the wide adoption of multimodal analgesia, the optimal combination of analgesic strategies remains uncertain.

Objective

To review and synthesize current evidence on analgesic strategies for acute pain management in patients with rib fractures.

Methods

We conducted a narrative review by searching scientific literature on PubMed and Scopus to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on analgesia for rib fractures from blunt trauma. Included studies assessed pharmacologic, non-pharmacologic and regional anaesthesia interventions. Studies describing surgical treatment of multiple rib fractures or addressing analgesia for non-traumatic causes of rib fractures (e.g. neoplasms) or study design other than RCTs were excluded. Forty-seven RCTs met the inclusion criteria.

Results

Opioids remain the most studied class of analgesics in the context of rib fracture. While effective for acute pain relief, they pose significant risks, especially in the elderly population. Non-opioid agents - especially non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol -are effective components of opioid-sparing strategies. Thoracic epidural and paravertebral blocks offer superior analgesia and respiratory benefits but are associated with a steep learning curve, are time-consuming, and carry a significant risk of procedural complications. Emerging regional anaesthesia techniques, such as the erector spinae plane (ESP) and serratus anterior plane (SAP) blocks, demonstrated promising results due to their ease of administration and favourable safety profiles. Non-pharmacologic approaches, including cryotherapy, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and kinesiotaping, represent additional pain relief options, although evidence remains limited.

Conclusions

Multimodal analgesia - combining pharmacologic, non-pharmacologic and regional anaesthesia approaches -is considered the most effective strategy to guarantee pain relief in patients with multiple rib fractures. However, substantial heterogeneity remains in the regimens employed. Further research is needed to standardize multimodal analgesic protocols and to assess their impact on long-term, patient-centred outcomes.

### Surgical rib fixation of multiple rib fractures and flail chest: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111tQDEo]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Multiple rib fractures and flail chest are common in trauma patients and may result in significant morbidity and mortality. While rib fractures have historically been treated conservatively, there is increasing interest in the benefits of surgical fixation. However, strong evidence that supports surgical rib fixation and identifies the most appropriate patients for its application is currently sparse.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines was performed to identify all peer-reviewed papers that examined surgical compared to conservative management of rib fractures. We undertook a subgroup analysis to determine the specific effects of rib fracture type, age, the timing of fixation and study design on outcomes. The primary outcomes were the length of hospital and ICU stay, and secondary outcomes included mechanical ventilation time, rates of pneumonia, and mortality.

Results

Our search identified 45 papers in the systematic review, and 40 were included in the meta-analysis. There was a statistical benefit of surgical fixation compared to conservative management of rib fractures for length of ICU stay, mechanical ventilation, mortality, pneumonia, and tracheostomy. The subgroup analysis identified surgical fixation was most favorable for patients with flail chest and those who underwent surgical fixation within 72 h. Patients over 60 y had a statistical benefit of conservative management on length of hospital stay and mechanical ventilation.

Conclusions

Surgical fixation of flail and multiple rib fractures is associated with a reduction in morbidity and mortality outcomes compared to conservative management. However, careful selection of patients is required for the appropriate application of surgical rib fixation.

### Surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF): the WSES and CWIS position paper [^112mnafe]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Project rationale and design

This position paper is supported by the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) and the Chest Wall Injury Society (CWIS) and aims to provide a systematic review of the literature investigating the surgical management of rib fractures in the emergency setting, to develop position statements based on the currently best available evidence and practice. For this purpose, the organizing committee constituted a steering committee, that had the task of drafting the present position paper, and an international expert panel composed of experts who were asked to revise the manuscript and position statements critically. The position paper was developed according to the WSES methodology. We shall present the systematic review of the literature and provide the derived statements upon which a consensus was reached, specifying the quality of the supporting evidence and suggesting future research directions.

Purpose and use of these guidelines

These guidelines are evidence-based, with the grades of recommendation based on the evidence. They do not represent the standard of practice, but are suggested plans of care, based on best available evidence and a consensus of experts. They do not exclude other approaches as being within a standard of practice. The treating clinician should determine the most appropriate action, after taking into account conditions at the relevant medical institution (staff levels, experience, equipment, etc.) and the characteristics of the individual patient. The responsibility for the management and outcome rests with the engaging practitioners, and not the consensus group. Furthermore, we recognize that the SSRF literature is continually evolving, and these guidelines represent the state of the art at the current time, subject to modifications as new research becomes available.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^115Jeywp]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Rib fracture pain management — Management of rib fracture pain requires a multimodal approach; begin scheduled acetaminophen and NSAIDS as soon as possible. If a regional block is likely, select a COX-2 inhibitor to avoid platelet inhibition. Muscle relaxants, if not contraindicated, may help relieve chest wall muscle spasm, and evidence suggests they reduce length of stay and respiratory complications in rib fracture patients. Consider the early use of regional analgesia to avoid the potential complications of opioids. An epidural is preferred for treatment of patients with bilateral rib fractures, but paravertebral blocks can be used when an epidural is contraindicated. Intercostal blocks with liposomal bupivacaine are another option when patients may have contraindications to paravertebral or epidural blocks such as coagulopathy or spine fractures. The addition of opioids begins with oral administration and may include breakthrough rescue doses of intermittent IV opioids with escalation to a PCA if multiple rescue IV doses are required. For continued rib pain, consider operative rib fixation.

The number of rib fractures sustained correlates with mortality and complication risk in multiple studies. In the 1994–2003 NTDB study described above, patients with single rib fractures had 5.8% mortality, 5 fractured ribs conferred 10% mortality, 6 with 11.4%, 7 with 15%, and 8 or more with 34.4% mortality. Likewise, additional rib fractures were associated with increased risk of death, pneumonia, ARDS, pneumothorax, aspiration pneumonia, empyema, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), and hospital LOS. The level II trauma center study reported 5% mortality among patients with 1–2 ribs fractured, and 29% mortality among those with 7 or more fractures; 52% of their rib fracture patients overall required ICU-level care; additionally, number of rib fractures correlated with mortality, hypotension, and Injury Severity Score (ISS). However, a study from the NTDB showed that number of fractures correlated with mortality on univariate but not multivariable analyses; and a study of 594 patients from one institution found that number of rib fractures was not associated with mortality. However, a meta-analysis showed that higher numbers of rib fractures was associated with mortality, with a combined odds ratio (OR) of 2.02 (95% CI 1.89 to 2.15) for death among patients with three or more rib fractures compared with those with fewer rib fractures.

Rib fracture location and pattern is clinically important. Presence of bilateral fractures and concomitant lung parenchymal injuries were associated with increased risk of chest-related death in a cohort of 1495 patients from one institution. Among another cohort of 1490 patients with blunt chest trauma, mortality was associated with presence of flail chest in addition to number of fractures. Flail chest alone is associated with mortality of 16–17%. Mortality risk increased to 42% when pulmonary contusion was present in addition to flail. Presence of a first rib fracture was associated with 36% mortality in one study and high likelihood of concomitant injuries.

The text links poorly controlled pain and splinting to altered breathing mechanics, hypoventilation, and impaired gas exchange, and states that poorly controlled pain increases risk of pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and respiratory failure. Patients who are older than 65 years, have three or more rib fractures, or with underlying cardiopulmonary disease are identified as at greatest risk of morbidity and mortality.

Harborview Medical Center rib fracture management protocol

Harborview Medical Center is a state designated level I adult and pediatric trauma center, serving Washington, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho. The facility cares for ∼4000–4500 patients with blunt trauma annually, of which ∼600 per year have at least three rib fractures. Our facility has adopted a multidisciplinary bundled care pathway for management of patients with multiple rib fractures, which will be presented in this section. It incorporates many of the tenets proposed by Todd et al, but with broader inclusion criteria, early initiation of multimodal pain therapy, and frequent function-based scoring driven by nursing staff and the patient.

The Harborview rib fracture management protocol applies to all patients admitted with acute rib and/or sternal fracture(s) who meet the following criteria: age > 14 years, extubated or recently extubated, GCS 13–15, and absence of high spinal cord injury. Patients over age 65 with ≥ 3 rib fractures are to be admitted to the ICU. The protocol includes interventions and monitoring by nursing staff, respiratory therapists, and physicians, and includes specific guidelines for ICU and acute care status patients, as further depicted in figure 1.

### Chest wall injury society recommendation for surgical stabilization of nonunited rib fractures to decrease pain, reduce opiate use, and improve patient reported outcomes in patients with rib fracture nonunion after trauma [^1149rNY7]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Rib fractures are common injuries which can be associated with acute pain and chronic disability. While most rib fractures ultimately go on to achieve bony union, a subset of patients may go on to develop non-union. Management of these nonunited rib fractures can be challenging and variability in management exists.

Methods

The Chest Wall Injury Society's Publication Committee convened to develop recommendations for use of surgical stabilization of nonunited rib fractures (SSNURF) to treat traumatic rib fracture nonunions. PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane database were searched for pertinent studies. Using a process of iterative consensus, all committee members voted to accept or reject the recommendation.

Results

No identified studies compared SSNURF to alternative therapy and the overall quality of the body of evidence was rated as low. Risk of bias was identified in all studies. Despite these limitations, there is lower-quality evidence suggesting that SSNURF may be beneficial for decreasing pain, reducing opiate use, and improving patient reported outcomes among patients with symptomatic rib nonunion. However, these benefits should be balanced against risk of symptomatic hardware failure and infection.

Conclusion

This guideline document summarizes the current CWIS recommendations regarding use of SSNURF for management of rib nonunion.

### Rib fixation: who, what, when? [^11318LDx]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Indications

After review of the current studies, it is recommended that one should consider fixation for those with five or more ribs fractured with a flail (see figures 2–4), particularly those requiring invasive or non-invasive positive pressure ventilation. The caveat to this are those patients who will require long-term mechanical ventilation for other reasons, for example, severe traumatic brain injury, high cervical cord injury or severe underlying lung disease. The use of pain severity score as a criterion for fixation has been called into question, as pain is a subjective and variable from patient to patient. However, pain not relieved adequately with medical treatment in addition to respiratory compromise (eg, deficiency in pulmonary function tests) may be reasonable. There are a number of retrospective and prospective observational studies that also support other indications for surgery: symptomatic non-union, chest deformity, and thoracotomy for other reasons (box 1).

Figure 2
Chest X-ray with severe chest wall injury.

Figure 3

Figure 4
Three dimensional reconstruction of severely injury chest wall.

Box 1
Indications

Recommended:

≥ 5 rib flail chest requiring mechanical ventilation;
Symptomatic non-union;
Severe displacement found during a thoracotomy for another reason.

Consider:

≥ 3 rib flail not requiring mechanical ventilation;
≥ 3 ribs with severely displaced fractures (bi-cortical displacement);
≥ 3 ribs with mild to moderate displacement and 50% reduction of expected forced vital capacity percent despite optimal pain management.

Absolute contraindications:

Contaminated field.

Relative contraindications:

Severe lung contusion requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation;
High cervical spine injury requiring mechanical ventilation.

Technical considerations

Once a patient is identified preoperative, CT scan is helpful to plan the incision and to decide on the best course of action (figures 3 and 4). There are a number of devices available which predominately fall into five categories: (1) plating with cortical screws (single plate or U-type plate), (2) absorbable plating,(3) Judet struts or Judet-like struts, (4) Kirschner wires, and (5) intramedullary rods. The majority of studies use plates with cortical locking screws. There are no studies that suggest one device being superior to another. Once the patient is identified and the device decided on one must assess the position of the rib fractures via the CT scan which can also provide a three-dimensional illustration (figure 4). These reconstructions can be helpful for operative planning.

### Operative fixation of rib fractures after blunt trauma: a practice management guideline from the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma [^113nAV8C]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Rib fractures are identified in 10% of all injury victims and are associated with significant morbidity (33%) and mortality (12%). Significant progress has been made in the management of rib fractures over the past few decades, including operative reduction and internal fixation (rib ORIF); however, the subset of patients that would benefit most from this procedure remains ill-defined. The aim of this project was to develop evidence-based recommendations.

Methods

Population, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) questions were formulated for patients with and without flail chest. Outcomes of interest included mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation (DMV), hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), incidence of pneumonia, need for tracheostomy, and pain control. A systematic review and meta-analysis of currently available evidence was performed per the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology.

Results

Twenty-two studies were identified and analyzed. These included 986 patients with flail chest, of whom 334 underwent rib ORIF. Rib ORIF afforded lower mortality; shorter DMV, hospital LOS, and ICU LOS; and lower incidence of pneumonia and need for tracheostomy. The data quality was deemed very low, with only three prospective randomized trials available. Analyses for pain in patients with flail chest and all outcomes in patients with nonflail chest were not feasible due to inadequate data.

Conclusion

In adult patients with flail chest, we conditionally recommend rib ORIF to decrease mortality; shorten DMV, hospital LOS, and ICU LOS; and decrease incidence of pneumonia and need for tracheostomy. We cannot offer a recommendation for pain control, or any of the outcomes in patients with nonflail chest with currently available data.

### Clinical management of rib fractures and methods for prevention of pulmonary complications: a review [^115GRRH2]. Injury (2019). Medium credibility.

Rib fractures are common injuries associated with significant morbidity and mortality, largely due to pulmonary complications. Despite equivocal effectiveness data, incentive spirometers are widely utilized to reduce pulmonary complications in the postoperative setting. Few studies have evaluated the effectiveness of incentive spirometry after rib fracture. Multiple investigations have demonstrated incentive spirometry to be an important screening tool to identify high-risk rib fracture patients who could benefit from aggressive, multidisciplinary pulmonary complication prevention strategies. This review evaluates the epidemiology of rib fractures, their associated pulmonary complications, along with the evidence for optimizing their clinical management through the use of incentive spirometry, multimodal analgesia, and surgical fixation.

### Emergency department management of patients with rib fracture based on a clinical practice guideline [^111zNjtE]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) have the ability to increase efficiency and standardize care. A CPG based on forced vital capacity (FVC) for rib fractures was developed as a tool for triage of these patients. The objectives of this study were to assess the efficacy and compliance of physicians with this rib fracture CPG.

Methods

Patients > 18 that were discharged from an urban level 2 trauma center emergency department (ED) between the dates of January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2016, were eligible for the study. Demographics, mechanism, outcomes and FVC were abstracted by review of the electronic medical record. Compliance with the CPG was examined, and comparisons were made between patients successfully discharged and patients who returned.

Results

455 patients met were identified during the study period. 233 were eligible after exclusions. 64% of the cohort was male with median age of 53 years. Falls were the most common mechanism (59.6%). The median number of rib fractures was 2 and median FVC 2500 mL. 28 (12.0%) of the 233 returned to the ED after discharge. The groups were well matched with no significant differences. The most common reason for return was pain (95%). Adjusted analysis showed that increasing age (adjusted OR (AOR) 0.968) and FVC (AOR 0.999) were independent predictors. Adherence with the CPG was good for hemothorax/pneumothorax and bilateral fractures (96%), but lagged with the number of fractures (74%).

Conclusions

This study confirms that the rib fracture CPG is safe and an FVC of 1500 mL is a safe criterion for discharging patients with rib fractures. Interestingly, it appears that older age is protective. More work needs to be done on effective pain control to decrease return to ED visits using this CPG.

### Beyond guidelines: surgical stabilization of rib fractures in patients with chronic pain [^1143GmZn]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This case presents a unique scenario where a patient with chronic pain and complex rib fractures, initially deemed ineligible for surgical intervention based solely on adherence to national guidelines, ultimately required emergent surgical stabilization on hospital 5 due to an escalating pain crisis and worsening respiratory mechanics. This patient failed maximum conservative management of their rib fractures and our team thought they required delayed surgical stabilization of their rib fractures. Ideally, rib fractures should be stabilized within 72 hours of presentation.

While conventional recommendations dictate surgical intervention for patients with specific fracture patterns (ie, flail chest or multiple bicortical offset fractures), severe displacement in several ribs or evidence of paradoxical chest motion, this patient initially fell outside these criteria, with only one rib displaying greater than 50% displacement. This case demonstrates the need in select patient populations (ie, with severe chronic pain) to consider early rib stabilization when they possess pulmonary physiologic derangements despite locoregional anesthesia and multimodal pain therapy (but do not meet the displacement or fracture pattern guidelines).

This case reminds us that evolving clinical presentations necessitate continuous re-evaluation by the trauma team of the treatment approach that may not align with current guidelines. Given this changing clinical picture and the urgency of the patient's pain crisis, a tailored approach was necessary, irrespective of the conventional guidelines. This decision underscored the commitment to prioritizing the patient's individual circumstances and adapting to their changing clinical needs.

Indications for SSRF: the 'WHO'

Patient selection criteria

A multidisciplinary approach tailored to the strengths and weaknesses of local hospitals is required for any chest wall reconstruction program such that rib fracture management is successful. SSRF is optimal in dedicated centers with protocols for non-operative management and SSRF for rib fractures. SSRF performed at high-volume centers (≥ 13 procedures annually) is associated with significantly lower mortality rates and shorter hospital lengths of stay (LOS). The decision to provide SSRF rests on the ability to provide adequate analgesia, degree of respiratory compromise, presence of flail chest (FC) or chest wall deformity and non-union or malunion of rib fractures. Using an evidence-based approach, the World Society of Emergency Surgery and the CWIS developed the following simplified approach (figure 1).

Indications for SSRF

Severe FC with respiratory compromise

Patients exhibiting paradoxical chest wall movement secondary to FC leading to ventilatory insufficiency are prime candidates for SSRF. SSRF should be considered in all patients with FC. Stabilization restores chest wall integrity and enhances respiratory mechanics, resulting in fewer unplanned intubations, decreased ventilator days, shorter LOS in intensive care units and the hospital, fewer deep vein thromboses and ventilator-associated pneumonia as well as improved survival.CWIS guidelines advocate for early SSRF in such cases to improve outcomes.

### Rib fractures, the evidence supporting their management, and adherence to that evidence base… [^1134B7Wa]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

However, from this juncture, given that trauma surgeons are wont to form strong but divergent opinions regarding management, the treatment courses vary. Is a chest computed tomographic scan necessary. Should the patient be admitted to an intensive care unit. Which form of analgesia is most appropriate. Should a thoracostomy tube be placed for a modest associated pneumothorax or hemothorax. Does noninvasive ventilation have a role. If there are multiple adjacent rib fractures, should the fractures be operatively stabilized. In their cohort study evaluating more than 625 000 patients with rib fractures at 777 US trauma centers in the National Trauma Data Bank from 2007 to 2014, Tignanelli et al1 waded into the complex but fundamentally central topics of how, from an empirical perspective, trauma surgeons actually manage these patients and how aligned this care is with the available evidence from comparative effectiveness studies.

They identified that among 6 so-called evidence-based practices — ie, neuraxial blockade, intensive care unit admission, pneumatic stabilization, chest computed tomographic scans for elderly patients. with at least 3 fractured ribs, operative fixation of what is known as flail chest, and tube thoracostomy for pneumothorax or hemothorax — 3 were associated with decreased inpatient mortality, and adherence across all centers to all 6 EBPs was modest at best and negligible at worst. Readers could easily conclude that trauma surgeons disregard available evidence of comparative effectiveness and are not optimally managing patients with chest wall injuries, possibly at significant detriment to the outcomes of those patients.

An appraisal of the quality of evidence cited by Tignanelli et al1 suggests that studies of far higher quality are needed to justify EBPs for rib fracture management. For example, the evidence for intensive care unit admission for elderly patients with 3 or more fractured ribs consists primarily of an expert panel recommendation3 and 1 obliquely relevant single-center observational study involving a historical control group. 4 Even for topics evaluated by some randomized clinical trials, such as neuraxial blockade and operative rib fixation for flail chest, the quality of evidence on systematic review was considered very low with a high risk of bias.

### Surgical stabilization of rib fractures improves survival in functionally dependent trauma patients [^113NWEbs]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Rib fractures are common injuries in cases of multiple trauma, particularly among elderly and functionally dependent patients, and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. These fractures can cause severe pain, impaired ventilation, and increased risk of pneumonia or respiratory failure, especially in patients with pre-existing comorbidities. Traditional management primarily involves pain control and supportive care; however, conservative treatment may be inadequate for frail individuals. Studies have shown that in patients over 65 years old with rib fractures, conservative management is associated with mortality rates of up to 20% and complication rates as high as 30%.

In recent years, surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) has gained attention as a method for stabilizing fractured ribs, improving pulmonary mechanics, and reducing complications. Several studies have demonstrated that SSRF can shorten hospital length of stays (LOS), reduce ventilator dependence, and improve long-term functional outcomes. Current consensus guidelines recommend SSRF for all patients with flail chest injuries. Beyond flail chest, SSRF should also be considered in non-flail chest patients with multiple (≥ 3) ipsilateral severely displaced rib fractures, or in those with ribs 3–10 fractures accompanied by respiratory failure despite mechanical ventilation, or pulmonary derangements in non-ventilated patients despite adequate analgesia. Additional indications include chest wall deformities affecting lung function, flail segments with displacement (particularly antero-lateral), and severe pain unresponsive to conservative treatment. SSRF should ideally be performed in specialized centers with multidisciplinary teams and standardized care protocols to ensure optimal outcomes. Most existing research and clinical guidelines have focused on younger or physically independent populations, leaving the benefits of SSRF in functionally dependent patients largely unexplored.

### To fix or let them flail: the who, what and when of rib fixation [^112hKu11]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Rib fractures are the most common type of chest wall injury, occurring in approximately 10% of all traumatic injuries and 55% of blunt chest wall injuries. Accounting for over 400 000 annual hospital admissions, rib fractures are a significant source of morbidity and mortality. Mortality rates for rib fractures range from 2% to 20%, with the highest rates occurring among the elderly. Stawicki et al demonstrated that mortality for elderly patients (≥ 65 years) was higher compared with young patients (20.1% vs 11.4%), underscoring the need for guideline-driven care and early intervention. Studies consistently demonstrate a link between mortality and the number of broken ribs, with one particular study indicating that the odds of death rise by 19% for every fractured rib in elderly patients (age ≥ 65 years). Mortality following rib fractures mostly occurs due to pneumonia secondary to splinted, shallow respirations. Rib fractures are managed primarily through non-operative measures, but it has been widely recognized for millennia that immobilization leads to improved results. Reports dating back to Egyptian and Persian civilizations indicated improved outcomes with rudimentary rib immobilization, and rib fixation was practiced in America until the 1950s. Until recently, rib fracture management focused primarily on conservative, non-operative management. However, the failure to improve outcomes significantly with conservative management has fueled a paradigm shift in the contemporary management of rib fractures and fueled a debate on the utilization of open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF).

Chest wall injuries, particularly rib fractures, significantly impact patient mobility, morbidity and mortality, especially in higher-risk patients. Effective, evidence-based, management is crucial to reduce complications such as respiratory failure, prolonged hospitalization and chronic pain. Surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRF) has re-emerged as a pivotal intervention in specific scenarios, offering benefits over conservative treatment. This expert review discusses the indications, procedural considerations, timing and follow-up for SSRF, guided by evidence-based recommendations from the Chest Wall Injury Society (CWIS).

Elderly patients

Elderly patients have been consistently shown to have poorer outcomes following rib fractures, which may relate to comorbidities, reduced physiological reserve, and greater difficulty assessing and managing hemodynamics. Meta-analysis showed that patients aged ≥ 65 had a combined OR for mortality of 1.98 compared with younger patients, with low heterogeneity. A study using Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database over 2002 through 2004 evaluated 18 856 patients with rib fractures from motor vehicle crashes and found that age was associated with increased crude and adjusted risk of death within 24 hours; a 13-year study of 27 855 patients with trauma in Pennsylvania with multiple rib fractures found that patients aged ≥ 65 had mortality of 20.1% compared with 11.4% in younger patients, including when stratified by number of ribs fractured. Elderly patients in this study had longer hospitalizations, longer ICU lengths of stay, longer ventilator requirements, and greater risk of acute respiratory failure, pneumonia, and pulmonary effusion. Likewise, a retrospective cohort of patients treated at a level I trauma center over 10 years showed that patients ≥ 65 years had longer mean ventilator days, ICU days, and hospital stay; mortality was two times higher in elderly patients and increased with number of rib fractures. Regarding complications, this study showed that pneumonia occurred in 31% of elderly compared with 17% of young patients, late pulmonary effusion occurred in 41% of elderly and 14% of young, ARDS occurred in 9% of elderly and 5% of young, and lobar collapse occurred in 8% of elderly and 3% of young patients. Elderly patients with 3–4 rib fractures had a 19% mortality rate and 31% frequency of pneumonia; those with more than 6 rib fractures had 33% mortality and 51% frequency of pneumonia.

Summary

Effective management of bony and cartilaginous thoracic injury is a vital part of the care of the polytraumatized patient. Commonly because of high-energy accidents including motor vehicle collisions and falls, these patients routinely require multidisciplinary care and surgical intervention. As our understanding of unstable chest wall injuries and pulmonary sequelae of the injury grows, it is imperative that injury patterns and surgical approaches become familiar to the orthopaedic trauma-trained surgeon. Common rib fracture patterns and muscle-sparing surgical approaches are detailed, with the goal of restoring chest wall stability to improve the mechanics of respiration and pain control in these challenging patients.

### Emergency department management of patients with rib fracture based on a clinical practice guideline [^113fE7Tf]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2017). Low credibility.

This study has the inherent limitations to all retrospective database studies including accurate data entry, accurate coding, selection bias and inability to account for confounders. One of the main limitations to the study was the poor initial adherence (51%) with obtaining a measured FVC. Multiple reasons identified for the poor adherence include education and familiarity with the outpatient arm of the algorithm by ED providers, lack of available respiratory therapists to measure the FVC and lack of time to implement due to disruption of ED throughput of patients. Several additional limitations to this study include that the inpatient population was not considered or analyzed and patients who were discharged and returned to other facilities would not have been identified in this study. There may have been patients who met the CPG criteria for discharge home, but were admitted due to other variables. These variables would likely not have been addressed by the CPG and, therefore, the CPG may be missing certain patient populations and cannot be generalizable to that demographic. The measurements of FVC and volume goals may not have been optimal. Studies have shown that FVC is significantly related to age and it may be beneficial to include this factor in the CPG. It is also reasonable to consider that young patients were more likely to return to the ED after rib fractures because an FVC close to 1500 mL is a greater degree of impairment compared with an elderly individual with a similar FVC. A better way to quantitate respiratory effort and function may be to calculate the percent predicted of the FVC based on individual patient characteristics to more accurately assess true impairment or adequate function.

Further research is needed to determine what can be considered as appropriate pain control for patients with rib fractures. Additionally, future research should be performed to determine whether these guidelines are maintained as part of routine clinical care with similar incidence of return to the ED after rib fractures.

Conclusion

This study confirms that the ED discharge pathway of the rib fracture CPG is safe and an FVC of 1500 mL is a safe minimum criterion for discharge in the absence of hemothorax, pneumothorax or bilateral fractures. Adherence with the number of fractures lagged, but number of fractures did not predict return to the ED and will be excluded from the CPG. Interestingly, it appears that older age is protective. Finally, more work needs to be done on effective pain control to decrease return to the ED using this CPG.

Scoring systems

Clinical and radiographic scoring systems have been developed for patients with thoracic trauma and rib fractures for risk assessment. Pape et al reported a scoring system with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.916–0.924 for chest-related complications or death based on number of rib fractures, arterial oxygen tension:fractional inspired oxygen ratio, presence of lung contusions, pleural involvement and patient age. Chapman and colleagues established RibScore, a radiographic scoring system assessing presence of ≥ 6 rib fractures, bilateral fractures, flail chest, ≥ 3 severely displaced fractures, first rib fracture, and presence of fractures in the anterior, lateral and posterior regions. This scoring system was associated with development of pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, and tracheostomy with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.71–0.75. Patients who developed pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, or who required tracheostomy had higher summed RibScores than those who did not develop such complications. Likewise, bivariate analyses showed that each of the variables in the RibScore correlated with the same complications.

Rib fracture repair has been performed at selected centers around the world for more than 50 years; however, the operative indications have not been established and are considered controversial. The outcome of a strictly nonoperative approach may not be optimal. Potential indications for rib fracture repair include flail chest, painful, movable rib fractures refractory to conventional pain management, chest wall deformity/defect, rib fracture nonunion, and during thoracotomy for other traumatic indication. Rib fracture repair is technically challenging secondary to the human rib's relatively thin cortex and its tendency to fracture obliquely. Nonetheless, several effective repair systems have been developed. Future directions for progress on this important surgical problem include the development of minimally invasive techniques and the conduct of multicenter, randomized trials.

Introduction

Traumatic rib fractures are a common diagnosis, found in approximately 6% to 10% of admitted trauma patients. These fractures, whether occurring alone or in conjunction with other injuries, have significant clinical implications, including pulmonary morbidity, mortality, and a reduced quality of life. Recent population-wide research revealed an overall mortality rate of 6.9% among patients with rib fractures.

To address the risks of morbidity and mortality associated with rib fractures, previous research has established the importance of prioritizing interventions such as effective pain management, pulmonary hygiene, and early walking. These measures aim to prevent chest wall splinting, which may restrict pulmonary function and contribute to the development of pneumonia and respiratory failure. As such, numerous institutions have incorporated evidence-based intervention recommendations into early intervention clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for patients with high-risk rib fracture. Notably, the implementation of these CPGs have been associated with reduced pulmonary complications, mechanical ventilator days, and mortality. However, despite published guidelines, there is still a paucity of high-quality literature guiding optimal management of thoracic trauma patients.

On conducting a review of chest trauma management at Vancouver General Hospital, a level 1 trauma center, the importance of early patient identification and the implementation of evidence-based interventions for pain management and pulmonary hygiene became evident. A multidisciplinary team of trauma surgeons, anesthesiologists, nursing staff, and respiratory therapists developed a comprehensive multidisciplinary chest trauma clinical practice guideline (CTCPG). We implemented the CTCPG in September 2020. The CTCPG incorporates the Rib Fracture Score (RFS) (figure 1) to categorize patients into low-risk and high-risk groups for chest trauma-related morbidity and mortality (figure 2). Patients are then directed along a personalized treatment pathway, determined by their risk levels and clinical course. This pathway encompasses therapeutic guidelines for pain management, respiratory support, and monitoring. The objective of this retrospective cohort study was to assess the impact of implementing the chest trauma CPG on pain management interventions and relevant patient outcomes.

Objective To examine adherence to 6 EBPs for rib fractures across US trauma centers and the association with in-hospital mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants. Main Outcomes and Measures Six EBPs were defined: neuraxial blockade, intensive care unit admission, pneumatic stabilization, chest computed tomographic scans for older adults with 3 or more rib fractures, surgical rib fixation for flail chest, and tube thoracostomy placement for hemothorax and/or pneumothorax. Conclusions and Relevance Significant variation appears to exist in the delivery of EBPs for rib fractures across US trauma centers. Three EBPs were associated with reduced mortality, but EBP adherence was poor. Multiple factors, including trauma center verification level, appear to be associated with patients receiving EBPs for rib fractures.

We also excluded patients who were not admitted from the emergency department or were missing the emergency department disposition variable. We defined 6 EBPs for patients with rib fractures based on national trauma guidelines. 9, 14 We chose practices with varying levels of evidence. The recommendations evaluated were the following: Adherence to 3 EBPs was associated with reduced mortality: epidural placement in patients aged 65 years or older with 3 or more rib fractures, rib fixation. In this study, we identified significant variation in adherence to 6 EBPs for patients with rib fractures. We identified a low rate of adherence to neuraxial blockade, rib fixation, and ICU admission EBPs despite evidence-based national guideline recommendations. Forty percent of the eligible patients received a chest CT scan, and 42% of the patients with hemothorax/pneumothorax received tube thoracostomy.

Optimal care for patients with rib fractures is complex and requires engaged, multidisciplinary care. It is possible that centers may develop treatment protocols adhering to EBP measures but poorly integrate and deliver ancillary practices that likely also improve care. The delivery of such care pathways for patients with rib fracture has been shown to significantly reduce complication rates and reduce mortality by nearly 3-fold. 19 Future directions should seek to leverage highly granular electronic health record data repositories to characterize which practices within care pathways are most associated with improved clinical outcomes.

### Consensus statement: surgical stabilization of rib fractures Rib Fracture Colloquium clinical practice guidelines [^114kWtZ7]. Injury (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for rib fracture, more specifically with respect to surgical stabilization, technical considerations, RFC 2017 guidelines recommend to consider repairing significant muscle loss or injury during SSRF if there is either visible herniation of lung intraoperatively or a large defect with increased risk of future lung herniation. Attempt repairing these defects primarily with pericostal fixation. Use a mesh if the defect is not amenable to primary repair.

### Discrepancies in rib fracture severity between radiologist and surgeon: a retrospective review [^112Rd3SL]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Chest computed tomography (CT) scans are important for the management of rib fracture patients, especially when determining indications for surgical stabilization of rib fractures (SSRFs). Chest CTs describe the number, patterns, and severity of rib fracture displacement, driving patient management and SSRF indications. Literature is scarce comparing radiologist versus surgeon rib fracture description. We hypothesize there is significant discrepancy between how radiologists and surgeons describe rib fractures.

Methods

This was an institutional review board-approved, retrospective study conducted at a Level I academic center from December 2016 to December 2017. Adult patients (≥ 18 years of age) suffering rib fractures with a CT chest where included. Basic demographics were obtained. Outcomes included the difference between radiologist versus surgeon description of rib fractures and differences in the number of fractures identified. Rib fracture description was based on current literature: 1, nondisplaced; 2, minimally displaced (< 50% rib width); 3, severely displaced (≥ 50% rib width); 4, bicortically displaced; 5, other. Descriptive analysis was used for demographics and paired t test for statistical analysis. Significance was set at p = 0.05.

Results

Four hundred and ten patients and 2,337 rib fractures were analyzed. Average age was 55.6(± 20.6); 70.5% were male; median Injury Severity Score was 16 (interquartile range, 9–22) and chest Abbreviated Injury Scale score was 3 (interquartile range, 3–3). For all descriptive categories, radiologists consistently underappreciated the severity of rib fracture displacement compared with surgeon assessment and severity of displacement was not mentioned for 35% of rib fractures. The mean score provided by the radiologist was 1.58 (± 0.63) versus 1.78 (± 0.51) by the surgeon (p < 0.001). Radiologists missed 138 (5.9%) rib fractures on initial CT. The sensitivity of the radiologist to identify a severely displaced rib fracture was 54.9% with specificity of 79.9%.

Conclusion

Discrepancy exists between radiologist and surgeon regarding rib fracture description on chest CT as radiologists routinely underappreciate fracture severity. Surgeons need to evaluate CT scans themselves to appropriately decide management strategies and SSRF indications.

### The effectiveness of early surgical stabilization for multiple rib fractures: a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^113sKLgS]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Multiple rib fractures are severe chest traumas caused by falls, motor vehicles, and deceleration events that often lead to chest wall collapse, abnormal breathing, and other complications and even endanger the patient's life. A rib fracture occurs in 10–15% of patients who sustain blunt trauma, and it is associated with a morbidity and mortality rate of up to 25%. Multiple rib fracture-associated complications included atelectasis, pain, pneumonia, and respiratory failure, which worsened patients' pulmonary function and long-term recovery and prolonged the intensive care unit (ICU) stay and hospital length of stay. Kent reported that rib fractures are the most serious injury in more than half of elderly patients who died of chest injuries. Thus, appropriate clinical evaluation, management strategies, and treatment play a very important role in MRF patients.

Traditionally, multiple rib fractures are managed conservatively with mainly supportive agents, such as analgesia, mechanical ventilation, and pulmonary hygiene. It remains controversial whether multiple rib fractures should be surgically treated to achieve stability, and the clinical efficacy and surgical stabilization timing are also controversial. Pieracci reported a prospective, controlled clinical evaluation and found that surgical stabilization of multiple rib fractures can improve acute outcomes compared with the best medical management. Additionally, many recent systematic reviews and meta-analyses have found the benefit of surgical rib fixation for outcomes compared to conservative management, which is highly recommended as the first choice for multiple rib fractures. To our knowledge, the timing of surgical rib fixation is unclear. Becker reported that most MRF patients presented rib fracture fixation for more than 48 h, while there may be an increased rate of complications with longer intensive care units (ICUs) and hospital times. Recently, a matched-pairs analysis of the German trauma registry showed that early rib fracture fixation can decrease ICU stay and shorten the duration of ventilator use. Regrettably, almost all of the studies had small sample sizes or were retrospective studies. Hence, a larger, multicenter, controlled study with the best design is needed to clarify whether early rib fracture fixation can improve MRF patient prognosis.

Thus, we suppose that early rib fracture fixation can decrease the length of stay in the ICU and overall hospital stays, thereby decreasing the inflammatory response and protecting against infection. The present study aimed to test whether the timing of surgical rib fixation affected postoperative outcomes in a multicenter randomized controlled trial.
