## Question

4. (3 points) Three sectors with a radius of 100 cm and a central angle of 60° are placed as shown in the figure; then, the perimeter of this enclosed figure is cm. (π is taken as 3.14)

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the perimeter of an enclosed figure formed by three 60-degree circular sectors, each with a radius of 100 cm, and to express the answer using π ≈ 3.14. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the geometry of a single sector and how to compute its arc length. Then, I should verify how the three sectors are arranged and which parts of their perimeters contribute to the outer boundary. Next, I will calculate the total perimeter by summing the relevant arc lengths and straight edges, and finally I will double-check the arithmetic and state the answer clearly with units.

> Let me first confirm the basic parameters of one sector. A circular sector with radius 100 cm and central angle 60 degrees has an arc length given by (θ/360) × 2πr, where θ is in degrees. Plugging in θ = 60 and r = 100 cm, the arc length is (60/360) × 2 × 3.14 × 100 = (1/6) × 628 = 104.67 cm, which I should keep in mind as I proceed [^notfound].

> Wait, let me verify the arrangement before I sum anything. The phrase "placed as shown in the figure" implies a symmetric configuration where the three sectors share a common vertex and are rotated 120 degrees apart, so that their straight radii meet and the arcs form the outer boundary. In that case, the enclosed perimeter consists of three arc lengths and no exposed straight edges, because the radial sides abut internally and are not part of the outer perimeter. I should confirm that assumption aligns with typical problem setups of this type, and it does for three identical 60-degree sectors arranged around a point [^notfound].

> I will now examine the total perimeter. Since the outer boundary is composed solely of the three arcs, the total perimeter is simply 3 times the arc length of one sector. So, 3 × 104.67 cm equals 314 cm. Hold on, I should verify the multiplication: 3 × 104.67 is indeed 314.01, which rounds to 314 cm when using π ≈ 3.14, so the final perimeter is 314 cm [^notfound].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wondered if any straight edges might contribute, but on reconsideration, in the standard symmetric arrangement the radii coincide internally and do not add to the outer perimeter. Therefore, the correct total is just the sum of the three arcs, confirming the answer as 314 cm [^notfound].

---

The perimeter of the enclosed figure is **314 cm**. Each sector contributes a 60° arc of length (60/360) × 2π × 100 = 104.67 cm, and three such arcs total 314 cm. The straight radii are internal and do not contribute to the perimeter, so the final answer is **314 cm**.

---

## Step-by-step solution

### Step 1: calculate the arc length of one sector

The arc length (L) of a sector is given by:

L = [θ/360°] × 2π r

where:

- (θ = 60°) (central angle),
- (r = 100) cm (radius),
- (π ≈ 3.14).

Substitute the values:

L = [60/360] × 2 × 3.14 × 100 = [1/6] × 628 = 104.67 cm

---

### Step 2: calculate the total perimeter

The enclosed figure is formed by three such sectors, so the perimeter is the sum of the three arc lengths:

Perimeter = 3 × L = 3 × 104.67 = 314 cm

---

### Step 3: verify the configuration

The straight radii of the sectors are internal and do not contribute to the perimeter; only the curved arcs form the outer boundary. Thus, the total perimeter is simply the sum of the three arc lengths.

---

## Final answer

The perimeter of the enclosed figure is **314 cm**.

Geometric models of the Spatial relationships between the stent struts and the perforating arteries

After the dimensions of all perforating artery origins were measured, the formulas for the coverage percentage of the perforating artery origins depending on the stent strut width were calculated. Two clinical situations were considered — stent strut lies on the major axis of the perforating artery ostium (Model 1) and two parallel stent struts cover the ostium, mimicking the telescopic technique (Model 2, Fig. 1). The formulas were as follows:

whereis the stent strut width and whereis the length of origin short axis. For every perforating artery, calculations were performed for stent strut widths of 30, 60, 78, 100 and 150. The first three values are typical of flow diverting stents, and the other two values are typical of conventional stents. The analysis was performed with SAS 9.4 software (SAS Institute Inc. Cary, North Carolina, USA).

Geometric representations of the problem of coverage of perforating artery origin (red ellipse) by stent struts (grey boxes). The width of the stent strut is equal to d, the long and short axes of the origin are equal to 2a and 2b, respectively. MCA middle cerebral artery

The geometrical analogy of an ostium of a perforating artery covered by a stent strut is an ellipse covered by a rectangle (Model 1). The least optimal situation is when the stent strut lies on the major axis. Figure 1 shows the geometrical problem: an ellipse (semimajor axis lengthand semiminor axis length) covered by a rectangle (shorter side length).

We would like to calculate the area of the ostium of the perforating artery uncovered by the stent strut: four times the green figure area. The green figure shows the area of a disk sector (radius length, central angle) minus the area of the orthogonal triangle (hypotenuse, cathetus); the disc sector area should be scaledtimes.

### Operative guidelines for the reconstruction of the native glenoid plane: an anatomic three-dimensional computed tomography-scan reconstruction study [^d959b6d8]. Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Reconstruction of the native plane in biconcave eroded glenoids is difficult. Nevertheless, accurate reconstruction of this plane is imperative for successful total shoulder arthroplasty. This study aims to determine guidelines that can increase the accuracy of glenoid component positioning.

Methods

Three different circular planes were determined on 3-dimensional computed tomography (CT) scans of 152 healthy shoulders. First, the circular max (CM) plane is formed with the superior tubercle and 2 points, 1 anterior and 1 posterior, at the rim of the inferior third of the glenoid. Second, the circular inferior (CI) plane is formed by 3 points at the inferior 2 quadrants of the glenoid rim. Third, the circular minima (Cm) plane is formed with 3 points situated at the noneroded sector of the anterior glenoid. The angulation of the spinal scapular axis (SSA), the line between the most medial point of the scapular spine and the center of the three different glenoid planes, and the correlation coefficient between the radius of the circle and the length of SSA are calculated.

Results

Angle SSA in the x-axis were 94°, 93°, 93° and in the y-axis were 95°, 111°, and 111° for CM, CI, and Cm, respectively. Correlation coefficient between the radius of the circle and the length of SSA: r = 0.69 for CM, r = 0.75 for CI, and r = 0.75 for Cm.

Conclusion

Three points situated at the native anterior glenoid can reconstruct, within 2° accuracy (95% confidence interval, 1.8°-2.3°), the CI plane. A relationship exists between the radii of the 3 glenoid circles and the width of the scapula (SSA length).

Supporting Information Figure S2 arrays the signal course of slice 29 by the four MRA scans from a ring ROI indicated by two red circles in the MRA image, with rotation angles labeled every 45° around the ring. The averaged signal along the radius within the ring ROI as a function of rotation angles ranging from 45° to 225° is displayed for each MRA scan. The maximal and minimal signals across angles were highly correlated, which partly was due to the sensitivity of the receive coils. Both TOF and VSMRA scans at 175 mL/min produced lower signal than the corresponding ones at 350 mL/min. The LR and O45° encodings generated greater signal than FH encoding for most angles. The left and top sectors marked with green and yellow bars at the ring ROI of slice 29 on the raw MRA image are shaded with the same colors at the signal courses of each MRA scan. The contrast-to-noise ratio values from these two small sectors of four MRA scans at two flow conditions are listed in Table 1, with quantitative comparisons provided in Supporting Information S4.

3.2 | Arterial spin labeling experiments

The ASL difference images in the acquired six slices at 350 mL/min are illustrated in Figure 3 for PCASL and VSASL with FH encoding. The 60 channels were enclosed in slice 1 when flowing radially right after the diversion from the feeding tube. They passed through slices 3 and 4 when flowing axially, and discontinued before slice 5. The perfusion layers were located from slices 3 to 6. Visual inspection showed that, at this flow rate, PCASL and the FH-encoded VSASL generated largely comparable contrast patterns at the perfusion layers. The VSASL method produced more difference signal than PCASL within the 60 channels in slices 1, 3, and 4. This indicated that the bolus duration of VSASL was longer than the postlabeling delay (1.5 seconds), which was further exemplified when the flow crusher was switched off.

### Heading direction with respect to a reference point modulates place-cell activity [^4a91ee7d]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

The concentration of reference points toward the center of the arena is not statistically significant. f Circular histogram of the direction to reference points at distal locations shows a significant concentration in the S-E direction (outside the 95% conf. interval). reference points within the box do not show any significant anisotropy. g Scatter plot of reference point coordinates (x — top, y — bottom) compared to the coordinates of the centers of the place fields for each neuron. There is no correlation between the locations of the reference points and the place field center of mass for the same neuron

Because our model reduces to a pure HD tuning when the reference point is far from the animal (Supplementary Fig. 8), neurons with distal reference points correspond to head-direction modulated neurons. The distal reference points we extracted show an angular preference (Fig. 3d–f), with the density peaking at a direction that coincides with the exit door of the experimental room, which is almost due south on the schematics (Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 9). In contrast to the distal reference points, the distribution of proximal reference points that are within the enclosure, corresponding to distinctively RH-modulated neurons, do not show any angular preference, but they have a higher density near the center of the arena than near its edges. This difference does not reach statistical significance, however (Fig. 3d, e). We also found no correlation between the location of the reference point within the enclosure for a given neuron and the center of its place field (Pearson's correlation coefficient r = −0.05 for x coordinate and r = −0.03 for y coordinate; Fig. 3g; "Methods"). This implies that place and RH tuning use two different reference systems.

### The 30-degree angle revisited [^eec48357]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2005). Low credibility.

The standard surgical ellipse, with 30 degrees apical angles and a length-to-width ratio of 2 or 3 to 1, works optimally on a flat surface. The same pattern, when used for excisions on strongly convex or concave surfaces, leads to distortions which may require significant revisions. The reason for these discrepancies is explainable by the mathematical differences between flat Euclidian geometry and curved non-Euclidian geometry. Understanding these basic mathematical principles as applied to cutaneous surgery should lead to better preoperative planning, fewer intraoperative surprises, and more pleasing results.

### Adaptation to feedback representation of illusory orientation produced from flash grab effect [^5d30e775]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

EEG procedures and data acquisition

Observers were tested individually in a dark testing room. Head position was stabilized with a chin rest at a viewing distance of 57 cm. Stimuli were presented on a CRT monitor (NESO FS210A, Nanchang, China) with a resolution of 800*600 and a refresh rate of 100 Hz. The experiment script was written in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc.) using the Psychophysics Toolbox, extensions.

As shown in Fig. 4a, b, the screen was filled with a uniform gray background. A small, black fixation dot was 5.9 dva (degrees of visual angle) above the screen center and a 60° sector (6.3% contrast with background) of 15.6 dva radius rotated back and forth below the fixation point. The sector rotated 80° (degrees of rotation) every second and reversed direction every 1500 ms (covering 120°, from −60° to 60° around vertical meridian). When the reversal occurred, a green vertical bar (0.3 dva in width) might flash for 30 ms (3 frames) at the vertical meridian, aligning with one of the two edges of the sector.

### ELLA: modeling subcellular spatial variation of gene expression within cells in high-resolution spatial transcriptomics [^b92a2c38]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Simulations

We performed comprehensive simulations based on imaging data to evaluate the performance of ELLA and compare it with other methods. We did not perform simulations based on sequencing data, as neither SPARWL nor Bento can be applied to analyze these data. For simulations, we first extracted the cell boundaries of the embryonic fibroblast cells from the seqFISH+ data, calculated the minimal and maximal radius of each cell, obtained a list of 90 reasonably shaped cells with the ratio of minimal and maximal radius ≥ 0.3, and extracted their nuclear centers and boundaries. We then sampled with replacement n cells from these cells. For each cell in turn, we applied the same binning strategy used in ELLA preprocess to divide the cell from the center of the nucleus into 100 circular sectors of equal angle measure. In each sector v, we denoteas the maximum distance between the center of the nucleus and the cellular boundary in the sector. We calculated the approximate area of the sector v as/100. We also denoteandas the minimum and maximum angle measurements of the sector, respectively. For the alternative simulations, we further divided each circular sector into 25 annulus sectors with equal distances.

With the above preparations, we simulated gene expression for 1000 genes, where each gene is expressed as a binary count on m subcellular localizations in each cell as imaging data. In the null simulations, none of these genes display cellular spatial expression patterns. In the alternative simulations, 800 genes are null, while 200 genes display different types of subcellular expression patterns. Specifically, in the null simulations, we first randomly sampled the number of measured locations inside each sector. We setto be proportional to the area of the sector using the function "np.random.choice" with the constraint. For each of thelocations in sector v, we obtained two independent random variables, and, from a uniform distribution, and converted them into the radius (r) and angle coordinates for the location, whereand. The radius and angle coordinates are further converted to the x and y coordinates in the form ofand.

### Graphical data presentation [^8085a383]. Injury (2008). Low credibility.

Figures and charts are the most influential vehicles for distributing scientific information, for affecting decisions as to the acceptance or rejection of a manuscript, and for attracting the attention of the scientific community to study results. Graphical excellence is mainly defined, first, by the highest possible data density (that is, the amount of information provided per graph area); second, by a low ink-to-data ratio (the avoidance of unnecessary shading, three-dimensionality, gridlines and what is often called 'chartjunk'); and third, by clear and unequivocal labelling of axes. The researcher's essential graphical toolbox should contain histograms, bar charts (always with measures of error), box-and-whiskers plots, scatter plots and forest plots.

### Keratoconus features on corneal higher-order aberration ablation maps: proof-of-concept of a new diagnostic modality [^1e1199e6]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Figure 1
(A) Contoura HOA ablation map in a representative keratoconus eye. (B) Graphical representation of the distance from center and position features of an ablation island. The distance from center (ρ) is defined as the radius (in mm) between the origin of the HOA ablation map (X = 0 and Y = 0 coordinates) and the centroid of any ablation island. The centroid denoted by the white asterisk (*) is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the X and Y coordinates of all pixels forming the ablation island (in this example, all purple pixels). The orientation (θ) of the ablation island is defined as the angle (between 0 to 360º) formed between the centroid of the ablation island and the abscissa (dotted line). (C) Graphical representation of the orientation and diameter features of an ablation island. The orientation (α) of an ablation island is defined as the angle (reported between 0 to 180º) formed between the longest diagonal of the ablation island (termed major axis in geometry) and the dotted horizontal line passing by the centroid of the ablation island. The diameter of an ablation island was defined as the length of the major axis (d). In addition to the above-defined parameters, we calculated the area (mm 2) and sphericity of each ablation island. The area was calculated by multiplying the number of pixels by the area of one pixel. The sphericity of an ablation island was defined as 4π times area divided by the square of the perimeter. Sphericity is equal to 1.0 for a perfect circle and it is smaller than 1.0 for an ellipse or a crescent shape.

Data and Statistical Analysis

Statistical analyses were conducted in MATLAB R2020a. Mean and standard deviation (SD) of each feature were calculated. The coefficient of variation (CV) was computed as the SD divided by the mean and multiplied by 100. The Pearson correlation coefficient (R-value) was used to assess the relationship between continuous variables. Statistical significance was set at P < 0.05.

### Comparing accuracies of length-type geographic atrophy growth rate metrics using atrophy-front growth modeling [^fbef3263]. Ophthalmology Science (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To compare the accuracies of the previously proposed square-root-transformed and perimeter-adjusted metrics for estimating length-type geographic atrophy (GA) growth rates.

Design

Cross-sectional and simulation-based study.

Participants

Thirty-eight eyes with GA from 27 patients.

Methods

We used a previously developed atrophy-front growth model to provide analytical and numerical evaluations of the square-root-transformed and perimeter-adjusted growth rate metrics on simulated and semisimulated GA growth data.

Main Outcome Measures

Comparison of the accuracies of the square-root-transformed and perimeter-adjusted metrics on simulated and semisimulated GA growth data.

Results

Analytical and numerical evaluations showed that the accuracy of the perimeter-adjusted metric is affected minimally by baseline lesion area, focality, and circularity over a wide range of GA growth rates. Average absolute errors of the perimeter-adjusted metric were approximately 20 times lower than those of the square-root-transformed metrics, per evaluation on a semisimulated dataset with growth rate characteristics matching clinically observed data.

Conclusions

Length-type growth rates have an intuitive, biophysical interpretation that is independent of lesion geometry, which supports their use in clinical trials of GA therapeutics. Taken in the context of prior studies, our analyses suggest that length-type GA growth rates should be measured using the perimeter-adjusted metric, rather than square-root-transformed metrics.

### The spatiotemporal scaling laws of urban population dynamics [^770b64ba]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Fig. 2
Schematic diagram for measuring the mean population fluctuation.

a An example of spatially annular division of concentric zones in Beijing. For the six cases, the center of the concentric structure represents the main city center or metropolitan core determined by their urban or regional master plans (see Supplementary Note 2 and Figs. S 1–6). Accordingly, Shenzhen has multiple main centers, while the other 5 cases have a single main center. The purpose of this division is to statistically calculate the mean population fluctuations, at a given distancefrom the main urban center within a specific time interval(in this case, min). For each circular ring with the width, its distance from the center is regarded as the radial distance from the midpoint of its width to the center. The widths of circular rings for the six cases are different, which are determined considering the sizes of both the study areas and spatial grids. Specifically, the circular ring width of four Chinese cities and Greater Boston is 3 km (1.15 km × 1.15 km spatial grid for Chinese cities, nearly 1 km × 1 km spatial grid for Greater Boston, and over 50 km urban radius), and that of Milan is 0.5 km (235 m × 235 m spatial grid and about 10 km urban radius). b The temporal scaling of the mean population fluctuationsof the red circular region in (a). Each circular region in cities could possess such a temporal scaling, thus forming Fig. 3a. c The spatial scaling of the mean population fluctuationsof Beijing with the time intervalmin. When changing the time interval, spatial scaling of population fluctuations could accordingly change, thus forming Fig. 3b. [Note: a is Powered by Esri.].

### Solar flare accelerates nearly all electrons in a large coronal volume [^91da610b]. Nature (2022). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Overview

In this study, we used the dataset from the EOVSAdescribed in an earlier paper. The model spectral fitting, its parameters and their uncertainties were described in the supplementary materials to that paper. The parameters used to create the evolving maps of the thermal and suprathermal electrons in the flare region are from the same spectral fits as those used for the magnetic field maps reported there. Here we used these maps of electron parameters to investigate the spatially resolved structure and evolution of the electron acceleration in the spatial area that showed the most prominent decay of the coronal magnetic field.

Spatially resolved microwave spectra and selection of ROIs

Extended Data Figure 1 shows a representative set of the observed spatially resolved microwave spectra from pixels with an area of 2″ × 2″ (about 2.1 × 10 16 cm 2) and associated model spectral fits distributed over the flare region. For reference, the central panel shows a single microwave image at 9.92 GHz taken at 15:58 UT, which corresponds to the main peak of the flare. (For the microwave image, the instrumental beam is 113″.7/ f (GHz) × 53″.0/ f (GHz). A circular restoring beam with full width at half maximum of 87″.9/ f (GHz) was used, which is about 9″ for 9.92 GHz shown in the figure.) The spectral fitting uses the model of the gyrosynchrotron source function with the account of the free–free component. We performed this model spectral fitting over all 60 time frames and over all pixels in these 60 map cubes, assuming a source depth along the line of sight (LOS) of 5.8 Mm (this corresponds to 8″ on disk, which is a scale of features (loops) seen in the flare images). The primary ROI, ROI1, indicated by the green contour, includes 137 image pixels that, under the same LOS depth assumptions, correspond to an estimated volume of about 1.7 × 10 27 cm 3. Consequently, the reference ROI, ROI2, shown by the cyan contour, which encloses 49 pixels, corresponds to an estimated volume of around 6.0 × 10 26 cm 3. The numbered points are pixels whose spectra and fits are shown in the other eight panels of the plot.

### Geographic atrophy growth is strongly related to lesion perimeter: unifying effects of lesion area, number, and circularity on growth [^00c837ce]. Ophthalmology: Retina (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To investigate the underlying reason for the previously observed impact of baseline lesion size, number, and circularity on geographic atrophy (GA) growth rate.

Design

Retrospective analysis of a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial.

Participants

Age-Related Eye Disease Study participants with GA secondary to nonexudative age-related macular degeneration.

Methods

We manually delineated atrophic lesions on color fundus photographs of 318 eyes with GA followed up over at least 2 visits (mean follow-up duration, 5.1 ± 3.0 years). We calculated GA area growth rate for each eye based on the first and last visit. GA perimeter-adjusted growth rate was defined as the ratio between GA area growth rate and mean GA perimeter between the first and last visit for each eye.

Main Outcome Measures

GA area growth rate, growth rate of the square root of GA area, and GA perimeter-adjusted growth rate.

Results

GA area growth rate was correlated strongly with mean GA perimeter (r 2 = 0.66). GA area growth rate was associated with baseline GA area (r 2 = 0.39; P < 0.001), lesion number (r 2 = 0.10; P < 0.001), and circularity index (r 2 = 0.28; P < 0.001). The use of the square root of GA area reduced the influence of baseline GA area (but not lesion number or circularity) on GA growth rate. In comparison, GA perimeter-adjusted growth rate (0.098 ± 0.062 mm/year) was not correlated with baseline GA area (r 2 = 0.005; P = 0.20), lesion number (r 2 = 0.00009; P = 0.86), or circularity index (r 2 = 0.007; P = 0.14). GA perimeter-adjusted growth rate was 50.0% higher in eyes whose fellow eyes showed GA at any visit (0.102 ± 0.062 mm/year) than in eyes whose fellow eyes never demonstrated GA during follow-up (0.068 ± 0.049 mm/year).

Conclusions

The growth rate of GA area is associated strongly with lesion perimeter. This relationship explains the previously observed influences of baseline GA size, lesion number, and circularity on GA growth rate. GA perimeter-adjusted growth rate is uncorrelated with the 3 morphologic factors and may serve as a surrogate outcome measure to monitor GA progression in future studies.

### Theory of branching morphogenesis by local interactions and global guidance [^9246d0a7]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Such extrinsic guidance provides a simple theoretical mechanism to restrict neuronal growth to a domain characterized by a well-defined opening angle. Turning to experiments, we found that reconstructed neurons were typically also characterized by such angle, which we estimated as. Theoretically, the average opening anglesdecreased monotonically with increasing field strength f c (see Fig. 4 a for an illustration) with strikingly similar values both in the presence and absence of self-repulsion (see Fig. 4 b). Using a simple geometric argument -assuming in particular that this opening angle is determined by the changes in the angle to origin θ values of the active tips at the boundary of the branching network, we could approximate this angle by:whereis the radial distance of the furthermost branch from the origin of the network (fixed by the maximal time of network growth). With this approximation, we could fit the numerical data by using a single fit parameter χ (see Supplementary Note 2 for further details). From the fitted value of the external field f c = 0.6, we predict an opening angle of(mean ± SD). Although this overestimates the experimental value, we note that this prediction is based on a perfectly radial gradient in 360 ∘ without boundary, i.e. assuming neurons can branch backwards. When we confined the theory to a 180 ∘ hemispherical region, which seems to reflect the experimental geometries (Supplementary Fig. 11), we obtained average opening angles of, much closer to the data.

Errors of the averages are determined by the standard deviations and highlighted by the dashed and dotted lines for f s = 0 and f s = −0.3, respectively. The monotonic decrease ofobtained from simulations is well-described by the analytical approximation(solid line), see Eq. (3), with the fit parameter χ = π /15.

### Analysis of foveal characteristics and their asymmetries in the normal population [^10fa7dfc]. Experimental Eye Research (2016). Low credibility.

The advance of optical coherence tomography (OCT) enables a detailed examination of the human retina in-vivo for clinical routine and experimental eye research. Only few investigations to date captured human foveal morphology in a large subject group on the basis of a detailed analysis employing mathematical models. However, even for important foveal characteristics unified terminology and clear definitions were not implemented so far. This might be a reason, why to this day the human fovea is considered to be a mostly symmetric and round structure. Therefore, the most important finding of this work is the detailed analysis of the asymmetric structure of the human fovea. We employed five clinically highly relevant foveal characteristics, which are derived from a previously published fovea model. For each, an accurate mathematical description is given. The presented properties include (1) mean retinal thickness inside a defined radius, (2) foveal bowl area, (3) a new, exact definition of foveal radius, (4) maximum foveal slope, and (5) the maximum height of the foveal rim. Furthermore, minimum retinal thickness was derived and analyzed. 220 strictly controlled healthy Caucasian subjects of European decent with an even distribution of age and gender were imaged with an Heidelberg Spectralis OCT. Detailed analysis demonstrated the following general results: (1) significant gender difference regarding the central foveal subfield thickness (CFST) but no significant differences for the minimum central retinal thickness, (2) a strong correlation between right and left eye of the same subject, and, as essential finding, (3) strong structural differences of the fovea form in the different anatomical directions (nasal, temporal, inferior and superior). In the analysis of the foveal asymmetry, it will be demonstrated that the foveal radius is larger in nasal and temporal direction compared to inferior and superior position. Furthermore, it will be shown that the circular fovea rather has an elliptic form with the larger axis along the nasal to temporal direction. Interestingly, the foveal slope shows a divergent behavior as the temporal direction has the smallest slope angle and both, inferior and superior angles are clearly larger than the others. The findings in this work can be used for an exact quantification of changes in early stages of various retinal diseases and as a marker for initial diagnosis.

### Quasi-monoenergetic laser-plasma acceleration of electrons to 2 GeV [^3501de6f]. Nature Communications (2013). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To help understand the experiment, we carried out particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations aimed at reproducing four key observations: a narrow 2 GeV peak, sub-mrad divergence, X-ray origin near the cell exit and a background of low-energy electrons. Previous PIC simulations had predicted that 100 J (200 J), 150 fs pulses focused to Gaussian spot radius w 0 ≈80 μm at the entrance of mid-10 17 cm −3 plasma would self focus, form a bubble and self inject electrons within 1.5 cm, before accelerating them quasi-monoenergetically up to 4 (7) GeV in the remaining plasma. The w 0 used in these simulations was an estimate based on early Texas Petawatt Laser performance showing focused spot sizes greater than an ideal Gaussian radius (f # λ = 50 μm) or the radius of the first Airy ring of a flat-top profile (1.22 f # λ = 60 μm) expected for f # = 47 and λ = 1.057 μm. In our experiments, incident pulse energy spread over an even larger radius w 0 ≈275 μm (white dashed circle in Fig. 4a, inset) that enclosed several 'hotspots', as evident in the typical high-power, equivalent-plane image of the transverse profile near the cell entrance shown in Fig. 4a, inset. A key question is whether these spots interact separately with the plasma, or merge owing to self focusing. In previous work, we developed a framework for answering this question based on the non-linear Schrödinger equation (NLSE), which describes the initial laser-pulse propagation in the paraxial approximation before plasma density perturbations become important. The NLSE has the conserved quantity

### Dioptric power and refractive behaviour: a review of methods and applications [^4441c625]. BMJ Open Ophthalmology (2022). High credibility.

Variances and covariances for refractive behaviour

For any sample of dioptric powers, measures of central tendencyand dispersion or variationare important and, for example, in table 1 variance–covariance matricesare given. They are, however, incomplete in that they only provide an understanding of variation in relation to the three axes as illustrated, for example, in figure 1B. With dioptric power, the issues around variation are more complicated with an infinity of possible directions for variation in the Euclidean 3-space (here SDPS). Consequently, meridionalor polar profiles(such as in figure 6) for variances and covariances are necessary and they inform us about variances in all meridians for the sample concerned. In figure 6, curvital variances are similar or uniform (≈4.5 D 2 or equivalent to SD offor all meridians but slightly less so for the right eyes (the outer black profile in figure 6). Torsional variances are almost zero (see the two profiles near the polar origin and although they are slightly variable across meridians the profiles are not significantly different and we would need to reduce the radial scale of 6 D 2 to better observe these profiles.) The covariances (that indicate linear covariation between pairs of coefficients for power) are not included in figure 6 but see referencesandby van Gool and Harris.

Figure 6
Polar profiles of curvital (outer profiles for f 11 and f 22 (+90)) and torsional (f 2 1 = f 12) variances (inner profiles near polar origin) for the right (in black) and left (in red) eyes of 279 participants, aged 9–63 years are provided. Variances for f 11 and f 22 are shown on the same profiles (red or black) but with a separation of 90° within profiles. There are four profiles but the two torsional profiles overlap and one cannot easily distinguish any differences between the black and red torsional profiles. The outer profiles are almost semicircles of constant radius and curvital variances are similar for the right and left eyes with respect to change across meridians. These profiles are used to understand the variation of power along meridians as well as to obtain quantities of interest such as meridians of maximum and minimum variance. The azimuthal scale is 0:180° and the radial scale is (0:1.5:6) and small numbers at 3 and 6on the vertical meridian can be seen (data 64 courtesy of NH).

### Nanoscale distribution of presynaptic Ca (2 +) channels and its impact on vesicular release during development [^f72c0e5b]. Neuron (2015). Low credibility.

Since Ca v 2.1 channels also form clusters within AZs at hippocampal and cerebellar synapses, the latter of which has been suggested to have a coupling distance of ∼20 nm, our perimeter release model may also be applicable to bouton-type synapses. A recent study at hippocampal mossy-fiber synapses suggests that vesicular release is driven by loose VGCC-sensor coupling (65 nm; see Figure 2C in). Using their 90% reduction of EPSCs by 10 mM EGTA, our perimeter release model predicts a similar coupling distance (four open VGCCs, PCD = 40 nm, or 55 nm from center; see Figure 6 D) and a slower vesicular release time course for the mossy-fiber terminal (see Figure 8 D). However, it remains to be determined if VGCCs also cluster at that synapse. Finally, a similar model has been proposed at invertebrate synapses, where fast phasic release requires a coupling distance of < 20 nm. These findings suggests that short coupling distances (< 100 nm) are a general requirement for fast AP-evoked vesicular release. Thus, within the framework of the perimeter release model it is possible to understand many aspects of vesicular release across a wide range of synapse types.

### Environment geometry alters subiculum boundary vector cell receptive fields in adulthood and early development [^c4a8daf0]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Neurons were classified as BVCs if they satisfied the above criteria on either of two trials run in the square open arena. The false positive classification rate for each neuron was assumed to be 1.49%, calculated under the assumptions that the chances of satisfying the BVC fit and Spatial Information criteria were independent, and that the chances of satisfying the criteria in either of the two square open field trials were independent. The 95% significance level for the percentage of neurons classified as BVCs at any given age was calculated as the 95th percentile of a binomial distribution based on N samples (where N is the total number of neurons recorded at that age), and a 1.49% success probability.

Graphical presentation of data

All data are presented as boxplots, unless the full distribution is also shown elsewhere as a histogram. Boxplots were generated using the Matlab (The MathWorks Inc, USA) function 'boxplot'. In all figures except Fig. 6, boxplots show the data median (central line), 25th and 75th percentiles (upper and lower box extremes), limits of the data excluding outliers (whiskers; outliers defined as lying more than 1.5 times the inter-quartile range beyond the upper or lower quartile), and 95 percent confidence interval for the median (notch in box; defined as q2–1.57(q3 – q1)/ √(n) and q2 + 1.57(q3 – q1)/ √(n), where q2 is the median, q1 and q3 are the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively, and n is the number of observations). In Fig. 6, due the compact nature of the plots, no notches are shown, and the median is shown by a circular target symbol.

### Prognostic value of shape-descriptive factors for the progression of geographic atrophy secondary to age-related macular degeneration [^30503e64]. Retina (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

To systematically compare the prognostic value of multiple shape-descriptive factors in the natural course of the disease.

Methods

A total of 296 eyes of 201 patients (female patients 130; mean age: 72.2 ± 13.08 years) with a median follow-up of 2.38 years from 2 prospective, noninterventional natural history studies (Fundus-Autofluorescence-in-Age-related-Macular-Degeneration [clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00393692], Directional-Spread-in-Geographic-Atrophy [NCT02051998]) were included in the analysis. Serial fundus autofluorescence images were annotated using semiautomated image analysis software to determine the lesion area, circularity, perimeter, and caliper diameters. These variables and the fundus autofluorescence phenotype were evaluated for prediction of the future square root progression rates using linear mixed-effects models.

Results

For the combined model, leave-one-out cross validation on patient level (Scenario 1: previously unknown patient) resulted in a goodness-to-fit (R value) of 0.244 and leave-one-out cross validation on visit level (Scenario 2: previous observation of the patient) in a R value of 0.391. This indicated that shape-descriptive factors could explain 24.4% of the variance in geographic atrophy progression in previously unknown patients and 39.1% in patients with previous observation.

Conclusion

These findings confirm the relevance of shape-descriptive factors and previous progression as prognostic variables for geographic atrophy progression. However, a substantial part of the remaining variation in geographic atrophy progression seems to depend on other variables, some of which are visible in optical coherence tomography.

### Reference database for a novel binocular visual function perimeter: a randomized clinical trial [^638b2984]. Ophthalmology Science (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We have established an RDB for the TEMPO perimeter. Our results have qualitatively confirmed earlier findings obtained using other SAP perimeters regarding asymmetric age-related changes in the 24–2 hill of vision, in which peripheral test points exhibited larger aging changes compared with those at central test points (Fig 2 A). Age rates of decline for the 10–2 may appear to vary less with eccentricity than those from the 24–2, simply because 10–2 test points extend only 9 degrees from fixation. Thus, we did not expect to observe significant 10–2 spatial asymmetries in aging effects, and indeed, we did not (Fig 2 B).

Figure 3 is based on the aging coefficients presented in Figure 2 and illustrates the expected magnitude of age effects over a 30-year period, during which sensitivity can decrease by as much as 2.5 dB in 24–2 tests.

The P < 0.05 significance limits for dB deviations from age-normal sensitivity (total deviation) at each test point are depicted for the 24–2 and 10–2 test patterns, respectively (Fig 4 A, B). As expected, these findings resemble, but are not identical to, values obtained from another widely used automated perimeter operating under similar testing conditions; this is likely because of design differences in testing strategies. It is essential to note that, in general, test results from different SAP devices are best compared relative to their own respective RDBs. Our significance limits also support previous observations of increasing intersubject variability with eccentricity (Fig 4 A, B). However, our limits do not increase as much with eccentricity as reported elsewhere. There may be ≥ 2 reasons for this discrepancy. First, early publications on this topic used the 30–2 test pattern. Compared with the 24–2 pattern used in this study, the additional peripheral test points of the 30–2 have been reported to have significantly higher variability from person to person than macular pointsand are also more likely to be affected by trial lens artifacts. Second, TEMPO lens correction optics have a diameter of 50 mm, which is considerably larger than the standard 38-mm trial lenses used in most perimeters, thus further reducing the likelihood of trial lens artifacts when using the TEMPO device.

### Radiomics-guided therapy for bladder cancer: using an optimal biomarker approach to determine extent of bladder cancer invasion from t2-weighted magnetic resonance images [^4ccf0ca6]. Advances in Radiation Oncology (2018). Low credibility.

Three-layer, shell-like volume of interest and radial sector placement

The visual appearance and image content of urine within the bladder lumen, bladder wall including the tumor sites, and perivesical fat on T2-weighted MRI scans are different as shown in Figure 1a. We postulated that the differential features that were extracted from these different regions can be utilized to determine bladder cancer T stage.

Figure 1
(a) The Visual appearance of bladder wall (arrows) on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scan. (b) Schematic diagram of 3-layer, shell-like structure including boundaries and 8 radial sectors.

To classify patients into the 2 T-stage groups, a 3-layer shell-like volume of interest (VOI) was placed about the urinary bladder as shown in Figure 1, Figure 2. This includes an inner shell (containing high T2-weighted signal intensity urine within the bladder lumen), a middle shell (containing low-signal intensity bladder wall that is predominantly comprised of detrusor muscle and slightly higher-signal intensity foci of bladder tumor), and an outer shell (containing high-signal intensity perivesical fat that extends up to 10 mm out from the outer aspect of the bladder wall). The inner and outer boundaries of the bladder wall were manually drawn using a computer-assisted visualization and analysis software system on axial T2-weighted MRI scans by 2 trained individuals (JC, SV) so that the 3 shells could be created.

After creating the shells, we further divided each shell automatically into 8 equally spaced radial sectors (S1-S8) as shown in Figure 2. This figure also shows an example of the 3-layer, shell-like structure and radial sectors that were placed on a T2-weighted MRI scan about the urinary bladder in 1 patient that covered the full extent of the VOI (6 slices) as specified for this patient. This enabled a comparison of the proposed approach for bladder cancer T-staging at both the patient and radial-sector levels. The sector-level analysis was carried out in the 3-dimensional sector. For illustration in Figure 2, the first 3-dimensional sector that corresponds to S1 is comprised of the 2-dimensional, wedge-shaped regions that are labeled S1 from the 6 slices stacked together. Thus, each patient data set yielded 8 3-dimensional sectors. Of note, each 3-dimensional sector itself consisted of 3 shells.

### Spatial specificity of alpha oscillations in the human visual system [^23de950c]. Human Brain Mapping (2019). Medium credibility.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Participants

Thirty participants (15 female, mean age 27.7 ± 8.8 years) without a history of neurological and/or psychiatric disorders signed a written informed consent form prior to the experiment in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The study was approved by the local ethics committee (commission for human‐related research CMO‐ 2014/288 region Arnhem/Nijmegen NL). This data set has been used for a previous report (Popov et al. 2017) that focused on different aspects of analyses.

2.2 Stimulus material and procedure

A variant of an Eriksen flanker task was used (Saalmann et al. 2012). In each trial, participants were instructed to fixate on a central white square (0.82° visual angle) presented on a gray background at a distance of approximately 84 cm. After a baseline "fixation" period (2 s, Figure 1 a), a spatial cue (100 ms duration; 1.36° visual angle) was presented at one of 16 pseudorandomly chosen locations (Figure 1 a). After a delay interval of 2.5 ± 1 s, during which subjects maintained the location information, a target shape (barrel or bowtie) appeared at the precued location embedded in a circular array of 16 shape stimuli (radius 16.5 cm, visual angle 22.22°). Targets were flanked either by congruent (C) or incongruent (IC) distracters. Targets and distracters had a visual angle of 2.73° × 3.07°. Target type (barrel or bowtie, 50% chance) as well as distractor congruency (congruent and incongruent at 50% chance) were randomly determined on each trial. Participants indicated via button press whether the target was a "barrel" (left index finger) or a "bowtie" (right index finger).

### Simple spatial scaling rules behind complex cities [^23b5e063]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Spatial scaling

Our simple rules produce the AP, road network, and socioeconomic interaction distributions (see Fig. 1b, c). The AP distribution and its morphology are in good agreement with the real city of Greater London (see Fig. 1d).

The model allows us to quantify these predictions. According to the SA mechanism, when t is sufficiently large the spatial distribution of AP is approximatelywhere ρ (r, t) is the average density at distance r from the city centre, i.e. the seed node at position (0, 0), R (t) is the radius of the entire city at time t (see Fig. 2b and further details of the explicit form of ρ (r, t) are in Supplementary Note 1), and β is a parameter derived from C. The dependence of β on C (see Fig. 2a) can be derived by the non-linear fitting, and the simulation results are shown in Fig. 2b. Figure 2c shows that the collected data validate Eq. (4). The AP in the real data is defined as a mixture of working and residential populations according to their active duration in that region (see Methods). In the downtown area (i.e. when r / R (t) → 0), the AP density decays following the power law shown in Eq. (4) (see Fig. 2c). In contrast, residential population density decays exponentially as we move from city centre to urban fringe, as verified in previous researchand our data (see Supplementary Fig. 8). This reconciles the conflict between area-size allometry and the exponential decay of population from city centre to urban fringe found in the literature. To eliminate the influence of noise in the empirical data and allow an unbiased comparison of different quantities, we study the cumulative quantities in terms of the distance from the central area instead of the local density (see Fig. 3). Integrating Eq. (4) we obtainwhere P (r, t) is the cumulative AP within the concentric circle of the central area with radius r (see Supplementary Note 3 and Supplementary Fig. 7 for detailed derivations). This expression is approximately a power law with an exponent 2 − β when. This is consistent with the fractal city hypothesis, and the fractal dimension is 2 − β if the distributions of APs and buildings are similar. We can similarly calculate the cumulative road length and socioeconomic interactions asandTherefore the exponents of the cumulative length of the road network and socioeconomic interactions within the circle of radius r are 2 − β /2 and 2 − 3 β /2. These predictions are consistent with the data from Beijing and London shown in Fig. 3. Due to the need for high-resolution data, we use nighttime light as the proxy for socioeconomic interactions –. Although nighttime light data has some intrinsic disadvantages when representing high-resolution interactions (e.g. at a community level, because luminosity is also associated with road density and type of land use), it remains the best candidate among open-source data. We show that as long as the spatial resolution is not excessively high it is a good proxy (see Methods, Supplementary Figs. 10 and 12–14 and Supplementary Note 6 for further discussion). Thus based on Eqs. (5)–(7) we can obtain all the other spatial scaling exponents from any single observation.

### Subicular neurons encode concave and convex geometries [^5593e5fe]. Nature (2024). Excellent credibility.

Animals in the natural world constantly encounter geometrically complex landscapes. Successful navigation requires that they understand geometric features of these landscapes, including boundaries, landmarks, corners and curved areas, all of which collectively define the geometry of the environment 1–12. Crucial to the reconstruction of the geometric layout of natural environments are concave and convex features, such as corners and protrusions. However, the neural substrates that could underlie the perception of concavity and convexity in the environment remain elusive. Here we show that the dorsal subiculum contains neurons that encode corners across environmental geometries in an allocentric reference frame. Using longitudinal calcium imaging in freely behaving mice, we find that corner cells tune their activity to reflect the geometric properties of corners, including corner angles, wall height and the degree of wall intersection. A separate population of subicular neurons encode convex corners of both larger environments and discrete objects. Both corner cells are non-overlapping with the population of subicular neurons that encode environmental boundaries. Furthermore, corner cells that encode concave or convex corners generalize their activity such that they respond, respectively, to concave or convex curvatures within an environment. Together, our findings suggest that the subiculum contains the geometric information needed to reconstruct the shape and layout of naturalistic spatial environments.

### Using the magnetoencephalogram to noninvasively measure magnetite in the living human brain [^61ff5697]. Human Brain Mapping (2019). Medium credibility.

Some of the calibration arrowmaps (of the many we recorded for visual study) are shown in Figure 3. From these maps, we learned how to estimate the magnetite distributions in the actual subjects, by looking at their arrowmaps on‐line, to make rapid recording decisions (e.g. should we wash his head again?) The subjects' patterns can also be calculated by forward modeling, as we have done, to lend confidence.

Figure 3
Calibration arrowmaps due to a 5‐μg sample of magnetite dust, placed at various z ‐distances along a central radius, and oriented at two different angles. (a): Z = 0 cm, θ = 0°. (b): Z = 7.0 cm. θ = 0°. (c): Z = 7.0 cm, θ = 90 0. Z = 0 is located at the air‐fiberglass interface, z = 7.0 is at location of most particle inverse locations. The gain in (a) has been reduced a factor of 10, compared with the gain in (b) and (c), because the arrows are so large, at this z; thusis actually 1,020. Θ is the angle between the dipole and the z ‐axis. We ignore the second angle, because the first angle Θ makes almost no difference to. By turning through various angles, the pattern in c becomes, for example, close to the arrowmap recorded pattern in Figure 2 d lower [Color figure can be viewed at]

2.4.2 Preliminary information: The calibration curve

This preliminary is necessary in step 4. Our calibration curve isversus z, at a particular dipole angle, for 5 μg of magnetite dust. The calibration curves at different angles fortuitously are within 10% of each other, from which we made a master curve, and accept a 5% maximum error due to angle. The calibration curve we used is shown in Figure 4. From this curve we will find the mass which produced the arrowmap. We make a horizontal line at the appropriatevalue, and run it out horizontally to, say, z = 7 cm. We then ask: how many samples of 5 μg, to reach that point vertically? For example, in this case it is 2.2 samples, yielding a total clump mass of 11.7 μg, for the 89 y/o subject.

### Morphology of travel routes and the organization of cities [^1973d9ce]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

The city is a complex system that evolves through its inherent social and economic interactions. Mediating the movements of people and resources, urban street networks offer a spatial footprint of these activities. Of particular interest is the interplay between street structure and its functional usage. Here, we study the shape of 472,040 spatiotemporally optimized travel routes in the 92 most populated cities in the world, finding that their collective morphology exhibits a directional bias influenced by the attractive (or repulsive) forces resulting from congestion, accessibility, and travel demand. To capture this, we develop a simple geometric measure, inness, that maps this force field. In particular, cities with common inness patterns cluster together in groups that are correlated with their putative stage of urban development as measured by a series of socio-economic and infrastructural indicators, suggesting a strong connection between urban development, increasing physical connectivity, and diversity of road hierarchies.

### Morphology of travel routes and the organization of cities [^1346ad5c]. Nature Communications (2017). Medium credibility.

Dimensionless inness

The observed trends of the inness do not take into account the effects of varying travel areas at different distances from the center, or the variation in urban size across the studied cities. To account for these effects, we note that the travel area (averaged across cities) increases roughly quadratically with the geodesic distance s (Supplementary Fig. 5k), a trend also observed in ref.where the characteristic shapes of city routes had travel areas of O (s 2). Therefore, to account for any bias from variations in travel area within and across cities, we define a rescaled inness

In Fig. 3i, j, we plotfor the shortest and fastest routes finding that the inness effect is robust to potential biases due to length or area of trips. While the qualitative behavior is similar to that seen for, the inward tendency of routes is present over a broader r and θ for both the shortest and fastest routes. For instance, inward biases are apparent at distances of 5 km from the city center, an effect suppressed indue to the correspondingly smaller travel area. Furthermore, we now find a relatively more homogeneous distribution with a comparatively weaker dependence on r and θ. The trend forcontinues to support an average core–periphery structure in the cities we study (and therefore a city center), in combination with a smoothly decreasing density distribution of streets away from this center. The weaker angular dependence, in particular, hints at an isotropic variation in density of street junctions.

The distribution ofis comparatively less homogeneous for fastest routes, primarily due to the predominance of the high-capacity roads (Supplementary Fig. 2) adding, therefore, more variation to the inness profile. Across a wide range of r and θ, is generally lower than the shortest routes, while there is sharp increase at 15 ≤ r ≤ 30 and 40 ≤ θ ≤ 100. This is likely due to some of the motorways being specialized structures such as ring roads or bypasses that serve as attractors for traffic in the city periphery. This is confirmed by plotting the ratioin Fig. 3k, where one sees a factor of two or more inward bias in the fastest routes as compared to the shortest routes near the city periphery (~25 km).

Doppler insonation angle and cursor alignment — Angle of 60 degrees of Doppler insonation relative to vessel axis provides most accurate Doppler velocities; angle correction should be used to maintain Doppler angle of 60 degrees or less, and the Doppler cursor should be parallel to vessel axis in center stream of arterial flow; pulsed wave Doppler images from the same internal carotid artery demonstrate underestimation of peak systolic velocity with inaccurate Doppler angle.

### Modeling cryotherapy ice ball dimensions and isotherms in a novel gel-based model to determine optimal cryo-needle configurations and settings for potential use in clinical practice [^6cd9f57a]. Urology (2016). Low credibility.

At a duty cycle setting of 100%, all cryo-needle configurations were able to create a confluent central core at distances of up to 2 cm apart. Only at the lowest duty cycle setting of 20%, as distance between the needles increased, an hourglass shape (loss of ice ball confluence) developed with the central core being warmer than the area closest to the cryo-needle. The most efficient distance for cryo-needle placement was 1.5 cm for the 17G needles and 2 cm for the 10G needle. The multi-needle maps with a spacing of 1.5 cm apart with varying duty cycle settings for the 17G IceRod needle are shown in Figure 3.

Analysis of the various combinations shows that a central core of ≤ −40°C develops very consistently at a minimum distance of ~1 cm around the perimeter of the cryo-needles. The temperature increases linearly from this point to the ice ball leading edge (0°C), which is a further 0.85–1.15 cm away. Thus, the −40°C isotherm is approximately 1 cm inside the leading edge of the ice ball.

Analyzing duty cycle data shows us that, if needed, low duty cycle settings can be used to create small ice balls, but in routine practice the optimal is at a duty cycle of 70%-100%. This maximizes the area of the ice ball and allows consistent core temperatures of ≤ −40°C at most configurations and distances.

Real-time imaging of incident light

As mentioned previously, the passage of the laser beam through the transparent 3D system provides additional locations for determining the direction of the beam: an exit (P 2) in addition to an entry (P 1) (Fig. 3e). Figure 3f shows the mapping result for a representative case. As indicated in the bar graphs, the photoresponses of devices nearest to P 1 are slightly stronger than those at P 2, due simply to partial reflections and absorption (the device surface transmits 87% of the incident light). The direction of the incident beam (P 1 → P 2) follows from the spherical locations of the P 1 and P 2 vectors with respect to the hemisphere center. The P 1 → P 2 direction can be defined in terms of the azimuthal angle θ in the x – y plane and the polar angle φ between the x – y plane and z direction (Fig. 3g). This simple example extends naturally to more complex cases involving movement of the laser beam in θ, φ, and both planes. For present purposes, we explore three scenarios: (1) increasing θ from −45.0° to 45.0° while fixing φ at 90.0°, (2) decreasing φ from 90.0° to 67.5° while fixing θ at 0.0°, and (3) increasing θ from 45.0° to 135° and φ from 67.5° to 112.5°. In each, three combinations of θ and φ are tested, as shown in Fig. 4, with the laser beam incident on top of the 3D system. The direction (P 1 → P 2) can be expressed in spherical coordinates θ and φ. In all combinations in the three scenarios (nine experiments in total), the θ and φ coordinates calculated from the measured photoresponses match the coordinates directly measured with a protractor scale (Supplementary Fig. 17), as summarized in panels (a)–(c) of Fig. 4 along with the spatial mapping of the photoresponse. Corresponding bar graphs are in Supplementary Fig. 18. Note that although the system can map 360° rotations of θ in the x − y plane, the φ movement is limited by the array geometry, which imposes lower and upper circumferences on the hemispherical surface; see Supplementary Fig. 19. Simple modifications allow up to 45° movement of φ (Supplementary Fig. 20). All measurements and analysis can be performed in real time, as shown in the video clip of the supporting materials (Supplementary Movie 3). Further, the degree of accuracy in determining the position and direction improves with decreases in the distances between photoresistors and in the laser spot sizes (Supplementary Figs. 21 and 22). Moreover, the representative 3D photodetector showed good imaging capability in kHz range (Supplementary Fig. 23).

### Theory of branching morphogenesis by local interactions and global guidance [^34973bae]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Comparison between analytical model and simulations

Importantly, Eq. (1) describing the probability of branch orientation attains a steady-state solution (∂ t P st (ψ, t) = 0) that is largely independent of the form of the external field, i.e. it applies generically to different geometries after defining the relative branch alignment with respect to the external field. This solution predicts that the alignment of angles with respect to the polarity of the external field will be determined by the von Mises distribution (circular normal distribution):with a concentration parameter given by ν ≡ μ f c / D, and I 0 (ν) is the modified Bessel function of the first kind of order zero. The fluctuations in the angular alignment as determined by the variance will thus follow a universal scaling approximately given by σ 2 ∝ D / μ f c that underlines the relative contribution of the local noise to the external guidance. For an axial (linear) field parallel to the horizontal axis, for instance, the above solution applies to the distribution of the local angles φ of the branch segments (Fig. 1 d). In a radial external field emerging from a central point of origin, however, the alignment of a branch is determined by the angle difference ψ ≡ φ − θ between its local angle φ and its angle θ with respect to the origin of the external field, and thus ψ, rather than φ, is predicted to follow the von Mises distribution (see Supplementary Figs. 4–9 for the alignment angles for different model assumptions). Comparing these analytical criteria with the numerical simulations led to excellent agreement without using any fit parameter (Fig. 1 d–f).

To summarize, the combination of analytical modelling and numerical simulations allows us to make a number of predictions for different topological and geometrical properties of branched structures: A key signature of external guidance is that branching angles should conform to a von Mises distribution while the overall branching structure in an axial field can adopt a well-defined conical domain in the absence of defined boundaries. Furthermore, a signature of the stochastic nature of branching and annihilating random walks is that even with external guidance, the local branch length or overall network size and shape should be highly variable to random branching events and local density-driven termination of tip growth.

### Quantitative imaging metrics for the assessment of pulmonary pathophysiology: an official American Thoracic Society and Fleischner society joint workshop report [^7e0b2d1d]. Annals of the American Thoracic Society (2023). High credibility.

Basic stereological measurements for lung imaging — first-order parameters, probes, and reference space are specified. First-order parameters are volume (three-dimensional [3D]), surface (two-dimensional [2D]), length (one-dimensional [1D]), and number (zero-dimensional [0D]). Measurements are performed using geometric test probes, such as points (0D), lines (1D), planes (2D), or volumes (3D), with probe–voxel interactions generating countable events; raw counts yield ratios that are multiplied by the reference space volume to obtain absolute lung or subcompartment measures. It is crucial to define and measure a biologically meaningful reference space for analysis and reporting, because measurements expressed only as ratios are subject to "the reference trap", where changes can arise from the numerator, denominator, or both; an efficient volume measurement method, point counting, is used for acinar components by micro-CT and for extrapulmonary organ volume by CT.

Echocardiographic left ventricular (LV) volumes — Volume measurements are "usually based on tracings of the blood-tissue interface in the apical four- and two-chamber views", with the contour at the mitral valve level "closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the mitral ring with a straight line", and LV length "defined as the distance between the middle of this line and the most distant point of the LV contour". Techniques include biplane disk summation and area-length; biplane disk summation advantages are "Corrects for shape distortions" and "Less geometrical assumptions compared with linear dimensions", with limitations "Apex frequently foreshortened", "Endocardial dropout", and "Blind to shape distortions not visualized in the apical two- and four-chamber planes". For area-length, the advantage is "Partial correction for shape distortion", with limitations "Apex frequently foreshortened", "Heavily based on geometrical assumptions", and "Limited published data on normal population".

Figure 11 — HVAD inflow-cannula Doppler exam: An HVAD inflow-cannula Doppler exam is typically not possible due to characteristic color and spectral Doppler artifacts; when the inflow cannula is excluded from the 2D imaging sector the artifacts diminish and other Doppler assessments can be performed, and successful continuous-wave Doppler examination of mitral regurgitation can be achieved after slight rotation of the imaging sector away from the inflow cannula. Because the 2D image suggests the inflow cannula is directed toward the ventricular septum, normal inflow-cannula flow must be confirmed by other methods, whether transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) or transthoracic echocardiography (TTE).

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2017). Medium credibility.

Table 13 — Doppler echocardiography in evaluating severity of tricuspid regurgitation (TR) outlines color flow Doppler 2D and 3D techniques with optimization steps, advantages, and pitfalls. For proximal flow convergence, optimization includes aligning the direction of flow with the insonation beam to avoid distortion of hemisphere from noncoaxial imaging, changing the baseline of the Nyquist limit in the direction of the jet, and adjusting the lower Nyquist limit to obtain the most hemispheric flow convergence; advantages include rapid qualitative assessment, with pitfalls of multiple jets and nonhemispheric shape. For vena contracta (VC), optimization uses zoomed apical four chamber and RV inflow views; advantages note it is a surrogate for regurgitant orifice size, independent of flow rate and driving pressure for a fixed orifice, less dependent on technical factors, and good at identifying severe TR, while pitfalls include that it is problematic in the presence of multiple jets and that the convergence zone needs to be visualized to measure it. For jet area, optimization relies on four chamber, RV inflow, or subcostal views with pitfalls that it is dependent on driving pressure and jet direction and that jet direction/shape may overestimate (central entrainment) or underestimate (eccentric, wall-impinging) jet area. For color flow Doppler 3D (3D VC), optimization includes a narrow color flow sector, aligning orthogonal cropping planes along the jet axis, choosing a midsystolic cycle, and recognizing that noncoaxial jets or aliased flow may appear laminar but still represent regurgitant flow; advantages include that multiple jets of differing directions may be measured, with pitfalls that dynamic jets may be over- or underestimated and that limited spatial resolution will lead to overestimation.

### Quantitative T2 mapping after reperfusion therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction: a comparison with late gadolinium enhancement and cine MR imaging [^fad2c69a]. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

This study evaluates myocardial edema by quantitative T2 mapping in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and compares the lateral extent of myocardial edema with those of infarcted and dysfunctional myocardium.

Materials and Methods

Cardiac magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of 31 patients (M:F = 29:2, mean age: 52.5 ± 10.8years) with AMI were reviewed. On cine-MRI, all short axis images of the left ventricle (LV) were divided into 60 sectors. The regional wall motion of each sector was calculated as follows: systolic wall thickening (SWT, %) = [(LV wall thicknessES-LV wall thicknessED)/LV wall thicknessED] × 100. Dysfunctional myocardium was defined as sectors with decreased SWT lower than 40%. On LGE-images, myocardial infarction was defined as an area of hyper-enhancement more than 5 SDs from the remote myocardium. On T2 map, myocardial edema was defined as an area in which T2 values were at least 2 SDs higher than those from remote myocardium. The lateral extents of infarcted myocardium, myocardial edema, and dysfunctional myocardium were calculated as the percentage of central angles ((central angle of the involved myocardium/360) × 100 (%)) and then compared.

Results

The lateral extent of myocardial edema was slightly larger than that of infarcted myocardium (37.4 ± 13.3% vs. 35 ± 12.9%, p < 0.01). The lateral extent of dysfunctional myocardium (50.6 ± 15.3%) was significantly larger than that of infarcted myocardium or myocardial edema (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

The lateral extent of myocardial edema beyond the infarcted myocardium might be narrow, but the dysfunctional myocardium could be significantly larger than myocardial edema, suggesting stunned myocardium without edema.

Echocardiographic assessment of right atrial (RA) size — volume by 2D describes that "2D volumetric measurements are usually based on tracings of the blood-tissue interface on the apical four-chamber view" and that "At the tricuspid valve level, the contour is closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the tricuspid ring with a straight line". It adds, "Volumes can be computed by using either the single plane area-length" or "the disks summation technique", performed in a "2D view". The listed advantage is "More representative of actual RA size than linear dimensions", while limitations include "Assumes a symmetrical shape of the cavity", "Single plane volume calculation may be inaccurate since it assumes that RA enlargement is symmetrical", and "Normal values not well established".

TABLE 5
The RNFL Broken-stick Model With Associated Slopes Above and Below the Tipping Point, the Point at Which RNFL Thinning is First Associated With Visual Field Damage

With Table 6 and Figure 7, we evaluated the correlation between the MDB thickness and the RNFL thickness and whether the independently obtained tipping points for MDB thickness are consistent with those for RNFL thickness. With the Spearman correlation coefficients ~0.638 to 0.889 across all regions (Table 6), the MDB thickness shows a strong positive monotonic correlation with the RNFL thickness. Figure 7 shows the scatter plots of RNFL thickness against MDB thickness for the global average, the 4 quadrants, and the 4 sectors. There, a region, bounded by the 95% CIs of both the tipping points, encompassed the upper and lower confidence bounds of the lowess fit for all the quadrants and sectors. This suggests that the correspondence and consistency of the RNFL tipping points with their MDB counterparts respect the nonparametric correlation relationship of the RNFL and MDB thicknesses.

TABLE 6
Spearman Correlations Between the RNFL Thickness and the MDB Thickness

FIGURE 7
Correspondence of the independently determined tipping points for minimum distance band (MDB) neuroretinal rim thickness and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness for the global, quadrant, and sector values. The graph shows the correlation of the RNFL thickness (y -axis) with the MDB thickness (x -axis) for the global average, the 4 quadrants, and the 4 sectors. A point with coordinates given by the independently determined MDB tipping point and the RNFL tipping point is plotted on the scatter plot (indicated by the green star). The corresponding 95% confidence intervals for both tipping points are plotted (horizontal and vertical dashed lines). The red squares represent the normal subjects; the blue stars represent the glaucomatous subjects. A lowess smoothing fit (bold black line) to the RNFL-MDB data and its bootstrapped 95% confidence bounds were included to delineate the RNFL-MDB correlation for comparing the consistency of the tipping points. The confidence bounds falling within the 95% confidence regions (central dotted rectangle) defined by the tipping point indicates good one-to-one correspondence of the tipping points.

### Multiple radial midpupil lid distances: a simple method for lid contour analysis [^2eec9dc8]. Ophthalmology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe a new computerized method for the analysis of lid contour based on the measurement of multiple radial midpupil lid distances.

Design

Evaluation of diagnostic technology.

Participants and Controls

Monocular palpebral fissure images of 35 patients with Graves' upper eyelid retraction and of 30 normal subjects.

Methods

Custom software was used to measure the conventional midpupil upper lid distance (MPLD) and 12 oblique MPLDs on each 15° across the temporal (105°, 120°, 135°, 150°, 165°, and 180°) and nasal (75°, 60°, 45°, 30°, 15°, and 0°) sectors of the lid fissure.

Main Outcome Measures

Mean, standard deviation, 5th and 95th percentiles of the oblique MPLDs obtained for patients and controls. Temporal/nasal MPLD ratios of the same angles with respect to the midline.

Results

The MPLDs increased from the vertical midline in both nasal and temporal sectors of the fissure. In the control group the differences between the mean central MPLD (90°) and those up to 30° in the nasal (75° and 60°) and temporal sectors (105° and 120°) were not significant. For greater eccentricities, all temporal and nasal mean MPLDs increased significantly. When the MPLDs of the same angles were compared between groups, the mean values of the Graves' patients differed from control at all angles (F = 4192; P < 0.0001). The greatest temporal/nasal asymmetry occurred 60° from the vertical midline.

Conclusions

The measurement of radial MPLD is a simple and effective way to characterize lid contour abnormalities. In patients with Graves' upper eyelid retraction, the method demonstrated that the maximum amplitude of the lateral lid flare sign occurred at 60° from the vertical midline.

The center 1 mm region was excluded from measurement. Superior, superior nasal, superior temporal, inferior, inferior nasal, inferior temporal, and average thickness were measured with 12×9 wide and 6×6 macula modes; GCL + IPL thickness included the distance labeled in Figure 1 (regions between 2 green boundaries). An average value of the entire sector was reported.

Macular ganglion cell complex (GCC, Figure 1): GCC measurement was performed with the same Macula 6 sector circle as GCL + IPL measurements.

### Exposure to carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide in enclosed ice arenas [^a4edbb30]. Occupational and Environmental Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

This article summarises the latest information on the adverse cardiorespiratory effects of exposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) in enclosed ice rinks. Sources of CO and NO(2) emissions are identified, current standards for these agents, as well as methods of controlling the emissions, dispersion, and evacuation of these toxic gases are presented. A detailed literature search involving 72 references in English and French from research conducted in North America and Europe was used. Material was from peer reviewed journals and other appropriate sources. Air pollutants such as carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) which are present in enclosed skating facilities, may exacerbate a pre-existing pathogenic condition in those people who spend considerable time in these environments. Considering the popularity of ice hockey, short track speed skating, and figure skating, and the hundreds of hours that a sensitive person may spend each year in these environments, it would seem appropriate to seek more definitive answers to this important health problem. From the findings and conclusions of the research reviewed in this paper, 10 recommendations are listed.

### Water impacting on superhydrophobic macrotextures [^a0377677]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Results

Bouncing dynamics

A nickel wire of radius b (between 25 and 250 μm) is placed horizontally along an aluminium substrate (Fig. 1a). The whole system is treated using a commercial spray (Ultra Ever Dry, UtraTech International) consisting of hydrophobic nanoparticles dispersed in acetone. After solvent evaporation, micrometric layers of nanoparticles coat the substrate and the wire (Fig. 1b, c), making both of them similarly superhydrophobic. Advancing and receding contact angles of water are found to be 166° ± 4° and 159° ± 1°, showing the conjunction of high angles and low hysteresis characteristic of a Cassie state.

Water drops of density ρ = 1,000 kg m −3 and surface tension γ = 72 × 10 −3 N m −1 are formed from calibrated needles, allowing us to vary the radius R between 1 and 2.3 mm. For each needle, R is repeatable with < 10% error. Impact velocity V is varied between 20 and 150 cm s −1 by adjusting the height from which drops are released. Impacts are filmed from above and from the side using a high-speed video camera (Phantom V9) at typically 10,000 fps. Figure 2 shows top and side views of water drops of radius R = 1.3 mm impacting a substrate macrotextured by a straight wire of radius b = 100 μm (the corresponding movies are Supplementary Movies 1–4). Impacts are always centred, and the presence of a wire makes the successive liquid shapes anisotropic. We also report in the figure the temporal variation of the positions x and y of the drop edges along and perpendicular to the wire, as defined in the second photo. Origin of time is chosen when the south pole of the drop contacts the wire.

### Reveal, don't conceal: transforming data visualization to improve transparency [^e70712b9]. Circulation (2019). Medium credibility.

Reports highlighting the problems with the standard practice of using bar graphs to show continuous data have prompted many journals to adopt new visualization policies. These policies encourage authors to avoid bar graphs and use graphics that show the data distribution; however, they provide little guidance on how to effectively display data. We conducted a systematic review of studies published in top peripheral vascular disease journals to determine what types of figures are used, and to assess the prevalence of suboptimal data visualization practices. Among papers with data figures, 47.7% of papers used bar graphs to present continuous data. This primer provides a detailed overview of strategies for addressing this issue by (1) outlining strategies for selecting the correct type of figure depending on the study design, sample size, and the type of variable; (2) examining techniques for making effective dot plots, box plots, and violin plots; and (3) illustrating how to avoid sending mixed messages by aligning the figure structure with the study design and statistical analysis. We also present solutions to other common problems identified in the systematic review. Resources include a list of free tools and templates that authors can use to create more informative figures and an online simulator that illustrates why summary statistics are meaningful only when there are enough data to summarize. Last, we consider steps that investigators can take to improve figures in the scientific literature.

World Health Organization (WHO) visual impairment classification with best possible correction defines acuity-based categories and related field criteria as follows: Under visual acuity with best possible correction, category 1 has maximum less than 6/18 (20/70) and minimum equal to or better than 6/60 (20/200); category 4 has maximum less than 1/60 (central fixation at 1 meter) and minimum equal to or better than Light perception, and category 5 is No light perception. If the extent of the visual field is taken into account, patients with a field no greater than 10 degrees but greater than 5 around central fixation should be placed in category 3; patients with a field no greater than 5 around central fixation should be placed in category 4, even if the central acuity is not impaired. Terminology notes state that the term low vision in category H54 comprises categories 1 and 2 of the table; the term blindness comprises categories 3, 4, and 5; and the term unqualified visual loss comprises category 9.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2019). High credibility.

Paravalvular aortic regurgitation (AR) severity after TAVR — short-axis color Doppler examples use vena contracta area (VCA) and percent circumferential (Circ) extent relative to the prosthetic valve ring, where % Circ is calculated as (a/c) × 100 and, for two jets, [(a + b)/c] × 100; as VCA and Circ increase, AR severity is more significant, and once circumferential extent exceeds 30%, PVR is usually severe; example values shown across mild, moderate, and severe panels include VC Area 0.1 cm2, 0.2 cm2, 0.2 cm2, 0.26 cm2, 0.7 cm2 and % Circ 8%, 10%, 16%, 18%, 30%, with a note that VCA in TAVR is affected by both circumferential extent and thickness of the PVR.

### Figure and ground in the visual cortex: v2 combines stereoscopic cues with gestalt rules [^8e6d190d]. Neuron (2005). Low credibility.

Figure-ground organization is a process by which the visual system identifies some image regions as foreground and others as background, inferring 3D layout from 2D displays. A recent study reported that edge responses of neurons in area V2 are selective for side-of-figure, suggesting that figure-ground organization is encoded in the contour signals (border ownership coding). Here, we show that area V2 combines two strategies of computation, one that exploits binocular stereoscopic information for the definition of local depth order, and another that exploits the global configuration of contours (Gestalt factors). These are combined in single neurons so that the "near" side of the preferred 3D edge generally coincides with the preferred side-of-figure in 2D displays. Thus, area V2 represents the borders of 2D figures as edges of surfaces, as if the figures were objects in 3D space. Even in 3D displays, Gestalt factors influence the responses and can enhance or null the stereoscopic depth information.

### Nanoscale distribution of presynaptic Ca (2 +) channels and its impact on vesicular release during development [^5014f510]. Neuron (2015). Low credibility.

A Unifying Model for Understanding AP-Evoked Vesicular Release at Central Synapses

Our experiments and simulations suggest a topographical arrangement where most releasable vesicles (in response to a single AP) are located 15–30 nm from the outer perimeter of VGCC clusters (Figure 8 H, model 4). However, several other VGCC-sensor topographies have been proposed at mammalian central synapses, including random distributions of both VGCCs and release-ready synaptic vesicles within the AZ (model 1), synaptic vesicles surrounded by a ring of VGCCs (model 2), clusters of VGCCs, and a random distribution of synaptic vesicles within the AZ (model 3). SDS-FRL at the calyx of Held indicates that Ca v 2.1 channels are clustered at high densities on the synaptic face in areas smaller than AZs (Figures 1 and 2). These observations are compatible with both model 3 and model 4. However, simulations of model 3 (Figure S8 H) did not replicate our experimental levels of EGTA inhibition of vesicular release (Figure 5), unless a high number of VGGCs were placed within each cluster (> 50 for P14). Because we estimate that 90% of the VGCC clusters contain less than 50 VGCCs (Figure 2 D, after labeling efficiency correction), our experimental findings are not consistent with model 3. Moreover, EGTA inhibition and P v were both predicted by the perimeter release model 4 when the Ca 2+ sensor was positioned within tens of nanometers from the edge of the VGCC cluster. Although we cannot rule out that vesicles with negligible P v are located further away, our perimeter release model is consistent with the majority of experimental results on AP-evoked vesicular release at the calyx of Held.

where n is the number of clusters. We can interpret this ratio as the following: the numerator indicates intra cluster distance, in which a smaller value shows that each distinct cluster is tightly bounded. A larger denominator value implies that the inter clusters are well separated from each other. Thus, if the α value is generally small, we can conclude that the algorithm performs well.
2. The intersection area can be seen as computing the overlap between two clusters. We first remove the outliers (see Figure 1) (Tony, Ming, & Zhi‐Hua,) to compute the convex hull for each group and use them to measure the overlap. For the intersection area, we find the area of each polytope(cluster) and find the total area by summing them. After that we compute the overlap area between each cluster. In specific, this is done by summing all of the polytope areas minus the area of the union of all the polytopes, normalized by the area of the union. The lower value of intersection area determines the formation of good cluster with less overlap.
Roundness is the ratio of the area of each polytope to the area of the circumscribed circle. To compute the roundness of each cluster, we first represent each cluster as a cloud with a convex hull. To remove the effect of the differences in perimeters, we normalize the perimeters. This normalization effectively approximates the process of making the perimeters equal. Finally, we compute the area of the polytope and use the area as our measure of roundness. The higher roundness metric value determines the good quality of the cluster. More precisely, it quantifies how the samples are distributed around the mean of a given cluster.

### Visceral leishmaniasis in the muzaffapur demographic surveillance site: a spatiotemporal analysis [^18e06bc3]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2018). Low credibility.

In the Indian subcontinent, visceral leishmaniasis (VL) has a strongly clustered distribution. The "index case approach" is promoted both for active case finding and indoor residual spraying (IRS). Uncertainty exists about the optimal radius. Buffer zones of 50–75 m around incident cases have been suggested for active case finding, for IRS the recommendation is to cover a radius of 500 m. Our aim was to establish optimal target areas both for IRS and for (re)active case finding. We plotted incident VL cases on a map per 6-month period (January-June or July-December) and drew buffers of 0 (same household), 50, 75, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 m around these cases. We then recorded total population and numbers of VL cases diagnosed over the next 6-month period in each of these buffers and beyond. We calculated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) using the population at more than 500 m from any case as reference category. There was a very strong degree of spatial clustering of VL with IRRs ranging from 45.2 (23.8–85.6) for those living in the same households to 14.6 (10.1–21.2) for those living within 75 m of a case diagnosed, during the previous period. Up to 500 m the IRR was still five times higher than that of the reference category. Our findings corroborate the rationale of screening not just household contacts but also those living within a perimeter of 50–75 m from an index case. For IRS, covering a perimeter of 500 m, appears to be a rational choice.

### Accurate localization microscopy by intrinsic aberration calibration [^bf8f784f]. Nature Communications (2021). High credibility.

Localization accuracy throughout the focal volume

To estimate the accuracy of widefield calibration, we take the values from the local calibration functions, andas the true values. The error at the location of each calibration particle is the residual of the fit of a Zernike model to these values, or, for interpolant models, the value of the interpolant after removal of the calibration particle. For a Zernike model, the errors (Fig. 5) shrink toward the corners of a square field (Supplementary Figs. 11 and 12) due to the rapid fluctuation of Zernike polynomials of high order near the periphery of the fitting domain. This corner effect potentially embeds errors in the calibration function, such as interpolation does, and results in a significant deviation of error histograms from normality, with a mean excess kurtosis of 0.66 ± 0.15. Errors from interpolation do not have this trend (Supplementary Figs. 13 and 14). However, our experimental particles are within a circular subset of the field (Figs. 1 and 6), resulting in error histograms that are closer to normal, with a mean excess kurtosis of 0.34 ± 0.17. These results suggest optimizing accuracy by calibrating an imaging field that encircles the sample by an increasing number of Zernike polynomials.

### Nanoscale distribution of presynaptic Ca (2 +) channels and its impact on vesicular release during development [^86efccc5]. Neuron (2015). Low credibility.

We next examined whether our perimeter release model predicted the observed changes in synaptic delay and time course of vesicular release at different postnatal ages. Simulations for postnatal day 7 (P7) and P14 were performed using AP 7 and AP 14 waveforms and previously reported sensitivities of the Ca 2+ sensors for each age. We used a fixed pattern cluster containing six open VGCCs for P7 and four for P14, corresponding to the channel open probability per AP multiplied by the total number of channels per cluster estimated from EM (see Discussion for more details). Simulation results predicted that the vesicular release duration and synaptic delay are steeply influenced by PCD (Figure 8 D). Surprisingly, the different AP waveforms between P7 and P14 had a relatively minor effect on the vesicular release duration, whereas they had a marked influence on the synaptic delay (Figure 8 E). In contrast, shortening of PCD from 30 nm (for P7) to 20 nm (for P14, see Figure 6) predicted a 31% decrease in the vesicular release half duration (Figure 8 D, red arrow) comparable to mean experimental value (28%, Figure 8 C). The shortening of synaptic delay (35%, Figure 8 B) can be achieved through both changes in AP duration and PCD in simulation, which predicts 40% reduction (Figure 8 E, red arrow). The overall release time course for P7 and P14 simulations (in 0.1 and 10 mM EGTA) was comparable to the experimental findings (compare Figures 8 F and 8A). Moreover, increasing [EGTA] from 0.1 to 10 mM in the simulations had little effect on the synaptic delay and only a small reduction in the vesicular release half duration (Figure 8 G), similar to our experimental findings (Figures 8 B and 8C).

### On the influence of density and morphology on the urban heat island intensity [^f13901b0]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Application to a real-world example

Here, we briefly illustrate how the above findings can be applied to idealised urbanisation scenarios of the (real) city of Berlin. We restrict the simulations to urban development that takes place vertically (decrease/increase in building height), horizontally (shrinking/expanding extent of urban cluster), or that decreases/increases the urban fraction. For each of these three urbanisation types, we have created several configurations with changes in gross building volume varying between −50% and +100% compared to the present urban canopy data of Berlin (see "Methods" section). The parametrization is then used both to run the urban climate model and to calculate the quantity D in Eq. (3). Of course, in addition to urban structure factors, weather conditions (e.g. cloud cover and type, wind speed, and direction), and rural surface conditions (such as thermal admittance and surface wetness) are very important factors influencing the UHI intensity. Together with the reference run (the simulation with real urban canopy data for Berlin that was used to validate the configuration of the climate model, see "Methods" section), we performed 21 simulations.

The simulated UHI intensities from these scenarios are plotted against the change in gross building volume in Fig. 4a. We find that the increases in building height and urban fraction both lead to increases in UHI intensity, yet they behave differently, as the latter leads to faster UHI intensity increase. This is probably due to the stronger shadow effects from taller buildings, which reduce heat storage during the day. For the scenarios with changed urban cluster size, the trends are less clear. The fluctuations may be caused by the fact that the randomly removed or added urban cells vary in urban surface fraction, building structure, and street canyon configurations. In addition, the background climate and rural surface characteristics are heterogeneous throughout the domain, so that different expansion directions of the urban cluster will have slightly different influences on the resulting UHI intensity. The higher than reference run UHI intensity of the scenarios with decreased urban cluster size can be understood, when considering that outer cells normally exhibit lower urban surface fraction and building height. When these cells are removed, the remaining central urban core has relatively high building density, leading to higher UHI intensity.

### Guidelines for the evaluation of valvular regurgitation After percutaneous valve repair or Replacement: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography developed in collaboration with the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, Japanese society of echocardiography, and Society for Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance [^bf3f7eb2]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2019). High credibility.

Flow convergence (proximal isovelocity surface area [PISA]) after edge-to-edge mitral valve repair — at a Nyquist limit of 30–40 cm/s for central jets, mild MR is associated with a minimal flow-convergence radius of ≤ 0.3 cm, whereas severe MR is characterized by a large flow-convergence radius of ≥ 1 cm; after edge-to-edge device implantation, flow convergence can be used qualitatively but PISA is unsuitable for MR quantification because device-related factors can obscure or truncate the flow-convergence zone and make angle correction difficult.

Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2019). High credibility.

Figure 11 — echocardiographic parameters of reduction of mitral regurgitation (MR) severity to mild after edge-to-edge mitral valve repair include color Doppler features of small jets with "Small vena contracta width (< 0.3 cm)" and "Small flow convergence radius (≤ 0.3 cm)" with a "Central MR jet with limited penetration into LA"; vena contracta area (VCA) measurement is noted as "More tedious to perform VCA < 0.2 cm²". Pulmonary venous flow improves with "Change from S-wave reversal or blunting to antegrade flow" and "Marked reduction in D-wave velocity". Forward stroke volume increases with left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) velocity time integral (VTI) and stroke volume changing from "LVOT VTI: 9.12 cm LVOT SV: 35 ml" to "LVOT VTI: 14.8 cm LVOT SV: 56 ml", alongside a "paradoxical" decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) by "5–10%". New "spontaneous contrast within LA or LA appendage" may appear and is "Associated with low flow conditions including atrial fibrillation, and/or severe LV systolic dysfunction", while the "Mean diastolic MV gradient may not be markedly elevated (e.g. < 7mmHg)".

### Victoria continental microplate dynamics controlled by the lithospheric strength distribution of the east African rift [^b7934d76]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Table 1
Predicted rotation poles relative to the western plate after 10 My for different controlling parameters of the generic model setup.

RMSD root-mean-square residual distance.

Italic values indicate the parameters varied with respect to the reference model Ellipse 90 ° (*).

As shown in Table 1 and Fig. 4 c and h, extending the width between the arms (increasing minor axis a, circle models) reduces the rotation velocity and increases the distance of the pole to the center of the domain. Decreasing the major axis b to 375 km to obtain a smaller circular configuration leads to a smaller reduction of microplate rotation (Fig. 4 f).

As for a = 375 km, for circular mobile belt configurations (a = 750 km), rotation velocity drops when the opening angle α is smaller than 90° (Table 1 and Fig. 4 g–i). However, changes in angular velocity and pole location are less evident for opening angles > 90°. Strike–slip regimes develop in the most oblique segments of the circular rifts with α ≥ 90°.

EARS-like asymmetric opening angles of α W = 160° and α E = 120° reduce the angular velocity of the microplate by a factor ~ 2 (Table 1 and Fig. 4 q). The rotation pole is displaced northward and, moreover, to the east. This shift is due to the higher coupling along the eastern side of the microplate compared with the completely decoupled western side.

Varying the thinning factor f and the rift axis normal extent of the seed σ as detailed in Table 1 and Fig. 4 j–m shows that a thinning factor that is too small (model thick LAB seed) does not localize deformation in the rift arms. A thinner LAB, however, enhances localization, leading to an almost doubled angular velocity and rigid plates. A doubled mobile belt width has an insignificant effect on the model results, while a smaller σ reduces the rotation of the microplate by up to ~25%.

### Cortical idiosyncrasies predict the perception of object size [^77c616f6]. Nature Communications (2016). Medium credibility.

Analysis of functional cortical architecture

We next delineated the early visual regions (specifically V1) manually based on reversals in the polar angle map and the extent of the activated portion of visual cortex along the anterior–posterior axis. We then extracted the pRF parameter data separately from each visual field quadrant represented in V1. Data were divided into eccentricity bands 1° in width starting from 1° eccentricity up to 9°. For each eccentricity band we then calculated mean pRF spread and the sum of surface area estimates. For pRF spread we used the raw, unsmoothed pRF spread estimates produced by our fine-fitting procedure. However, the quantification of surface area requires a smooth gradient in the eccentricity map without any gaps in the map and with minimal position scatter in pRF positions. Therefore, we used the final smoothed parameter maps for this analysis. The results for pRF spread are very consistent when using smoothed parameter maps, but we reasoned that the unsmoothed data make fewer assumptions.

To extract the parameters for each stimulus location we fit polynomial functions to the relationship between these binned parameters and eccentricity. For pRF spread we used a first-order polynomial (that is, a linear relationship). For surface area we used a second order polynomial. We then interpolated each person's pRF spread/surface area at the 12 target locations in the behavioural experiments (that is, 4 stimulus locations and 3 eccentricities. Individual plots for each observer and visual field quadrant are included in the Supplementary Information. We also quantified the macroscopic surface area of each visual field quadrant in V1 by summing the surface area between 1° and 9°. This range ensured that artifactual, noisy estimates in the foveal confluence or edge effects well beyond the stimulated region did not introduce spurious differences between individuals. In our main analyses we normalized all surface area measures relative to the whole cortical surface area. However, results are also very consistent for using the square root of the absolute surface area for this analysis.

### Guidelines for noninvasive vascular laboratory testing: a report from the American Society of Echocardiography and the society of vascular medicine and biology [^240f6f0a]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2006). Medium credibility.

Duplex ultrasound vascular testing — beam orientation and Doppler angle: For B-mode imaging, the vessel of interest should be perpendicular to the ultrasound beam to obtain distinct echoes, and the ultrasound beam is directed perpendicular to the surface of interest to obtain the brightest echo with gray-scale imaging. The perpendicular angle is often readily obtained because arteries generally are parallel to the surface of the transducer. For the Doppler component, an angle of 60 degrees between the Doppler insonation beam and the vessel wall should be maintained; angles above 60 degrees can result in significant overestimation of the velocity and should be avoided. Angles that are not relevant to the vessel wall may misrepresent the true peak velocity.

### The configuration of Northern hemisphere ice sheets through the quaternary [^beaef961]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Outline digitisation

Data on the extent of glaciation during the Quaternary were digitised and georeferenced using Esri's ArcGIS software. Three types of data were digitised: empirical outlines of ice-sheet extent (coloured fill), which are often regional or ice-sheet wide; modelled outlines of ice-sheet extent (coloured lines), which are typically ice-sheet wide or span the NH; and point-source data (red circles) that show the former occupation of a site by ice (Supplementary Figures 2–10). We include published evidence for mountain glaciers, ice fields, ice caps and ice sheets in the raw data maps. Some empirical outlines were too small to georeference and were plotted as point-source data. Some of our raw data maps show more than one data point (red circle) for each previously published study; for example, where there are multiple data sites. Where many dates have been acquired from a relatively small area, we show a single data point in a representative location. Ice-marginal positions that are inferred from studies of IRD in sediment cores were included as point-source data. In these cases, the data point (red circle) was placed at the position that the core was taken, and an arrow shows the location that the ice was interpreted to have reached. Unless a glacial curve diagram is also included, the presence of IRD in a marine sediment core is taken to indicate that the ice sheet reached close to the present-day coastline. Only grounded ice sheets were mapped; we do not depict ice shelves, e.g. in the Arctic Ocean. We did not plot the locations of areas in which the absence of glaciation has been inferred. However, information on ice-free areas informed the best-estimate reconstructions and is included in the explanations that accompany the maps (Supplementary Notes 1–18).

Our raw data maps (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Figures 2–10) were designed to be as objective as possible. No smoothing function was applied to the digitised outlines. As such, inaccuracies may have been inherited from the original data source and/or may originate from the digitising and georeferencing process. The raw data maps show the amount and distribution of published evidence for the general extent of the NH ice sheets during each time-slice: they should not be used for local-scale studies or as a substitute for the original source data.

### Visualizing cellular imaging data using phenoPlot [^82c578e6]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Results

PhenoPlot design

PhenoPlot employs many visual elements, such as differently sized, coloured and structured objects, to represent multiple dimensions independently of XY coordinates. Supplementary Table 1 lists all PhenoPlot elements that the user can choose for plotting depending on the features measured. Like other visualization tools, such as heatmaps and star and facial glyphs, data scaling is required in PhenoPlot. In the example shown (Fig. 1a), the cell body, nucleus, and perinuclear regions are represented using ellipses. The length and width of each of these objects are represented as the major and minor dimension of the ellipse, respectively. Dimensional variables (that is, length and width) should be scaled together to a 0.1–1 interval to maintain the aspect ratio between different dimensions and implicitly represent additional dimensions (for example, cell width-to-length ratio). In Fig. 1a, the number of nuclei is plotted as subcircles within the nuclear ellipse. The relative area of cell protrusions, such as lamellipodia, is represented on the top of the cell as a half-ellipse whose major dimension is proportional to the relative protrusion area (Fig. 1a). Intensities of the cell, nucleus and perinuclear regions are represented by mapping average intensity values of fluorescent markers to different colour hues.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^9a18e059]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left ventricular (LV) volume quantification by echocardiography — acquisition and measurement guidance are as follows: LV volumes should be measured from the apical four- and two-chamber views. Two-dimensional echocardiographic image acquisition should aim to maximize LV areas, while avoiding foreshortening of the left ventricle, which results in volume underestimation. Acquiring LV views at a reduced depth to focus on the LV cavity will reduce the likelihood of foreshortening and minimize errors in endocardial border tracings (Table 1). Because the issue of foreshortening is less relevant in 3D data sets, 3D image acquisition should focus primarily on including the entire left ventricle within the pyramidal data set. To ensure reasonably accurate identification of end-systole, the temporal resolution of 3D imaging should be maximized without compromising spatial resolution. At the mitral valve level, the contour is closed by connecting the two opposite sections of the mitral ring with a straight line. LV length is defined as the distance between the bisector of this line and the apical point of the LV contour, which is most distant to it. The use of the longer LV length between the apical two- and four-chamber views is recommended. Contrast agents should be used when needed to improve endocardial delineation when two or more contiguous LV endocardial segments are poorly visualized in apical views.

### Genetic dissection of morphometric traits reveals that phytochrome B affects nucleus size and heterochromatin organization in… [^26314327]. G3 (2017). Low credibility.

Gaining full understanding of the biological function of chromatin (de)condensation and the contributing molecular factors, requires an experimental genetic system in which morphometric parameters underlying chromatin organization can be independently quantified. In this work, we exploited the natural existence of genetic variation in nucleus and chromocenter morphometric parameters to provide such new fundamental insights in the molecular genetic basis of chromocenter formation and/or maintenance. Our morphometric analyses unveiled that nuclear area, density, and perimeter, as well as chromocenter roundness and heterogeneity correlate with the RHF. This is not the case for chromocenter density and the correlation between RHF and chromocenter area is low. This suggests that condensation of heterochromatin regions and overall chromocenter organization might not be directly linked.

Of note is the apparent distinction of phenotypes in nuclear heterogeneity, which seems to fall apart into three distinguishable classes (Figure 3). This illustrates how individual morphometric traits could be informative to understand the dynamics of chromocenter compaction. Although the distribution of phenotypes of this trait still has a Gaussian distribution (Table S1 in), we speculate that the distinguishable classes may reflect the three chromatin compaction types observed in a population of mesophyll nuclei; from type 1 containing conspicuous chromocenters to type 3 containing relaxed heterochromatin.

### Graphics and statistics for cardiology: designing effective tables for presentation and publication [^69ab87cd]. Heart (2018). Low credibility.

Research is of little use if its results are not effectively communicated. Data visualised in tables (and graphs) are key components in any scientific report, but their design leaves much to be desired. This article focuses on table design, following two general principles: clear vision and clear understanding. Clear vision is achieved by maximising the signal to noise ratio. In a table, the signal is the data in the form of numbers, and the noise is the support structure necessary to interpret the numbers. Clear understanding is achieved when the story in the data is told effectively, through organisation of the data and use of text. These principles are illustrated by original and improved tables from recent publications. Two special cases are discussed separately: tables produced by the pharmaceutical industry (in clinical study reports and reports to data safety monitoring boards), and study flow diagrams as proposed by the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses initiatives.

### What are the reference values and associated factors for center-edge angle and alpha angle? A population-based study [^eb7e6d31]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The available evidence regarding normal ranges for the center-edge angle and the alpha angle derives from a few small studies, and associated factors such as sex and anthropometric factors have not been well evaluated. Knowing more about normal values for these parameters is critical, because this can inform decisions about when to perform elective hip preservation surgery. Population-level studies would provide considerable clarity on these issues, but to our knowledge, no such studies are available.

Questions/Purposes

The purposes of this study were (1) to use MRI in patients of a population-based study to establish normal values for the alpha and center-edge angles in the normal adult hip; and (2) to determine whether age, sex, or anthropometric variables were associated with differences in these values.

Methods

We used MRI images (1.5 T) of 3226 participants of the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP). SHIP is a population-based study that started with 4308 participants in 1997. Participants were recruited randomly from official inhabitant data files as a stratified cluster sample of the population from a defined region in northeastern Germany. To ensure a representative epidemiologic cohort, stratification variables were sex, age, and city of residence. Between 2008 and 2012, 1094 of these participants underwent whole-body MRI with pelvic sequences in the second followup. In parallel, the next cohort, SHIP-Trend, started with the same protocol in which 2132 participants underwent MRI examination. Reference values were calculated by quantile regressions for the 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles. Associations with the demographic features sex, age, weight, height, body mass index (BMI), and waist circumference were analyzed by bivariate linear regression models.

Results

The mean center-edge angle was 31° (± 7°) with a corresponding calculated normal range of 17° to 45°. The mean alpha angle was 55° (± 8°) with a corresponding calculated normal range between 39° and 71°. Men (30° ± 7°) had a lower center-edge angle than women (32° ± 8°) (p < 0.001, β = 1.4°; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9°-1.9°) and a higher alpha angle (57° ± 8° versus 52° ± 7°, p < 0.001, β = 5.7°; 95% CI, 5.2°-6.3°). Moreover, a higher center-edge angle for the left side was found (33° ± 8° versus 30° ± 8°, p < 0.001, β = 3.2°; 95% CI, 3.0°-3.4°). In addition to sex, we found that age, height, waist circumference, and BMI affected both center-edge angle and alpha angle. Weight was associated with the alpha angle as well. Because of these associations, age- and sex-adjusted reference values with belonging formulas were calculated.

Conclusions

The range of normal center-edge and alpha angles is quite wide. Therefore, only markedly abnormal angles may be associated with pathology. Moreover, center-edge angle and alpha angle are associated with age, sex, and anthropometric factors, which have to be taken into account for better interpretation.

Clinical Relevance

The association of abnormal radiographic values with true clinical hip pathology is tenuous at best. Assuming that a patient with an abnormal radiograph requires treatment is unwise. The clinical picture has to be substantial for therapeutic decisions.

### Comparing 3 suture techniques after muscle laceration repair [^9eb75a86]. Hand (2021). Medium credibility.

Background: Skeletal muscle lacerations are a relatively common injury. Compared with nonrepaired lacerations, surgically repaired muscle lacerations regenerate faster, develop less scar tissue, have a higher return to baseline strength, and have lower incidence of hematomas. Despite the benefits of repair, the optimal repair technique is still unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine the biomechanical properties of common muscle repair techniques to determine the optimal repair. Methods: Forty-two fusiform porcine muscle specimens were dissected and used for this study. Three suture techniques were used for comparative analysis: Figure-eight, Mason Allen, and Perimeter. Each muscle was transected and then repaired using one of the 3 techniques. Fourteen muscle-tendon specimens were prepared for each group and tested for tensile failure using a material testing system. Biomechanical properties, including peak failure point and stiffness, were compared for differences between the suture groups by 1-way analysis of variance. The average time per repair technique was also recorded. Results: The Perimeter technique showed a statistically significant higher peak failure point than the Mason Allen technique (P = 0.03). Both the Figure-eight (P = 0.047) and Perimeter techniques (P < .001) were significantly stiffer than the Mason Allen technique. The repair time was comparable across all 3 techniques. Conclusions: The Figure-eight and Perimeter repairs were found to be similar in peak failure point and stiffness, whereas the Mason Allen technique showed significantly lower stiffness and peak failure point. The Figure-eight was the quickest repair to perform. The Figure-eight technique may be strongly considered for muscle laceration repairs due to its simplicity and efficiency.

### Basic mapping principles for visualizing cancer data using geographic information systems (GIS) [^636f342e]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Maps and other data graphics may play a role in generating ideas and hypotheses at the beginning of a project. They are useful as part of analyses for evaluating model results and then at the end of a project when researchers present their results and conclusions to varied audiences, such as their local research group, decision makers, or a concerned public. Cancer researchers are gaining skill with geographic information system (GIS) mapping as one of their many tools and are broadening the symbolization approaches they use for investigating and illustrating their data. A single map is one of many possible representations of the data, so making multiple maps is often part of a complete mapping effort. Symbol types, color choices, and data classing each affect the information revealed by a map and are best tailored to the specific characteristics of data. Related data can be examined in series with coordinated classing and can also be compared using multivariate symbols that build on the basic rules of symbol design. Informative legend wording and setting suitable map projections are also basic to skilled mapmaking.

### Recommendations for cardiac chamber quantification by echocardiography in adults: an update from the American Society of Echocardiography and the European association of cardiovascular imaging [^194fdbe5]. Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography (2015). Medium credibility.

Left atrial (LA) volume quantification by echocardiography is described using two-dimensional echocardiography (2DE) and three-dimensional (3D) approaches, with 2D volumetric measurements based on tracings from apical four- and two-chamber views; at the mitral valve level the contour is closed by a straight line, endocardial tracing excludes the atrial appendage and pulmonary veins, LA length L is the shortest long axis from apical two- and four-chamber views, and the two lengths should not differ more than 5 mm; volumes can be computed by an area-length approximation or by a disk summation technique, and 3D data sets are usually acquired from the apical approach using a multibeat full-volume acquisition. For the 2DE area-length technique, advantages include accurate assessment of asymmetric remodeling of the left atrium and being a more robust predictor of cardiovascular events than linear or area measurements, whereas limitations include geometric assumptions about LA shape, few accumulated data on normal population, and that single plane volume calculations are inaccurate because they assume A1 = A2. For 3D data sets, advantages are no geometrical assumption about LA shape and greater accuracy compared with 2D measurements, while limitations include dependence on adequate image quality, lower temporal resolution, limited data on normal values, and that patient's cooperation is required.
