## Question

A 45-year-old woman presents to your dermatology clinic with a 6-month history of generalized itching without visible skin lesions. She reports that the itching is worse at night and interferes with her sleep. She has tried various over-the-counter emollients and antihistamines with minimal relief. Her medical workup for underlying systemic causes is unremarkable. She expresses frustration and anxiety about her symptoms and asks if there are any other options to help her cope with the itching.

Based on current expert recommendations, what non-pharmacological interventions should you discuss with this patient to help manage her chronic pruritus?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about non-pharmacological interventions for a 45-year-old woman with generalized pruritus without visible skin lesions, worse at night, minimal relief from emollients and antihistamines, and a negative systemic workup. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and classifying the pruritus phenotype. Then, I should verify which non-pharmacologic options have credible evidence and guideline support. Next, I will prioritize interventions by strength of evidence and practicality, including sleep-focused strategies. Finally, I will outline implementation, follow-up, and when to escalate care, making sure I double-check each claim against guidelines and reviews as I go.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic frame. Chronic generalized pruritus without primary skin lesions, with a negative systemic workup, fits chronic pruritus of unknown origin (CPUO), which accounts for a meaningful minority of chronic itch cases and is distinct from pruritic dermatoses and systemic disease–associated itch, so I should explicitly label it as such to guide expectations and therapy selection [^e95c35db] [^7c4345c7].

> Wait, let me verify the role of non-pharmacologic therapy in CPUO specifically. The Cochrane review of CPUO found no eligible studies for most non-pharmacologic interventions, including emollients, cooling lotions, or phototherapy, which means evidence is indirect and largely extrapolated from chronic pruritus broadly; I need to be transparent about this limitation while still aligning with guideline-endorsed general measures that target barrier care, behavior, and sleep disruption [^e95c35db] [^07082fd2] [^d9db53ea].

> I will now examine barrier-directed measures. Even in the absence of visible dermatitis, liberal emollients and limiting water exposure are foundational to reduce xerosis and mechanical irritation that can amplify itch, and guidelines advise tailoring moisturizers to skin status; given her prior OTC emollients helped minimally, I should reinforce technique, frequency, and product selection (fragrance-free, hypoallergenic, richer formulations at night) and pair this with sleep hygiene to mitigate nocturnal scratching [^07082fd2] [^265a3e04].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about behavioral therapies; I should confirm which have guideline support. The European S2k guideline recommends educational programs and suggests relaxation and habit reversal as complementary strategies, and the BAD guideline supports psychosocial and behavioral interventions, including habit reversal, for distressed patients with likely psychogenic or refractory pruritus; CBT and habit reversal can interrupt the itch–scratch cycle and reduce nocturnal scratching, so I should frame these as evidence-aligned options rather than dismiss them as "just stress" management [^d9db53ea] [^c7a07451] [^fac9a939].

> Let me consider sleep-focused strategies because nocturnal worsening is a key driver of distress. I should confirm that sleep hygiene, relaxation, and bedtime routines are reasonable non-pharmacologic approaches; while direct CPUO trials are lacking, expert reviews and guidelines emphasize addressing sleep disturbances in chronic pruritus, and habit reversal plus relaxation can reduce nighttime scratching, so I will prioritize sleep optimization and document its impact on itch intensity and sleep quality over time [^7c4345c7] [^d9db53ea].

> Next, I should review device-based physical therapies. Phototherapy has antipruritic effects via neural modulation and is guideline-supported for chronic pruritus in selected cases, though evidence in CPUO is limited; given her refractory course and lack of primary dermatosis, narrowband UVB is a reasonable second-line consideration after optimizing barrier and behavioral measures, with counseling on logistics, risks, and expectations [^cebbe767] [^22564ff7].

> But wait, what about acupuncture or other complementary modalities. The BAD guideline suggests considering acupuncture as second-line therapy in generalized pruritus of unknown origin; evidence quality is limited, so I should present it as an optional, patient-centered adjunct with informed consent about uncertain benefit and potential costs or access barriers [^8702a4e6].

> I should double-check that I am not overpromising on supplements. Vitamin D supplementation has been suggested in generalized pruritus without rash, but evidence is weak and heterogeneous; if deficiency is present, repletion is reasonable, but I should avoid implying a robust antipruritic effect and instead frame it as correcting a potential contributor rather than a primary antipruritic therapy [^d7e0bda5].

> Let me synthesize a practical, prioritized plan. First, reinforce barrier care with a structured emollient regimen and water-exposure limits, including nighttime application and avoidance of fragranced products. Second, initiate behavioral therapy with habit reversal and relaxation training, ideally via referral to psychology or a trained clinician, and pair with sleep hygiene to target nocturnal itch. Third, if symptoms persist after 6–8 weeks, consider narrowband UVB phototherapy. Fourth, consider acupuncture as an adjunct if accessible and acceptable. Throughout, I will track itch severity (VAS or NRS) and sleep metrics to gauge response and adjust the plan [^07082fd2] [^d9db53ea] [^cebbe767] [^8702a4e6].

> I need to ensure follow-up and escalation are clear. Reassess at 4–6 weeks to review adherence, technique, and outcomes; if there is inadequate improvement, escalate to phototherapy and/or add pharmacologic options per guidelines, such as neuromodulators or antidepressants for refractory chronic pruritus, while continuing non-pharmacologic measures as part of long-term maintenance and relapse prevention [^d9db53ea] [^78f4ed5f].

> In summary, I should confirm that the most defensible non-pharmacologic approach for CPUO emphasizes barrier optimization, behavioral strategies to break the itch–scratch cycle, and sleep-focused measures, with phototherapy and acupuncture as conditional second-line options; I must be honest that direct CPUO evidence is sparse and that our plan integrates guideline consensus and indirect evidence, which still provides a coherent, patient-centered pathway to symptom relief and improved quality of life [^e95c35db] [^07082fd2] [^d9db53ea] [^cebbe767].

For chronic pruritus without visible lesions, prioritize **barrier repair** with frequent, liberal emollients and gentle skin care [^07082fd2] [^265a3e04], and **behavioral strategies** such as habit reversal, mindfulness, and CBT to reduce scratching and improve sleep [^d9db53ea] [^fac9a939]. Consider **phototherapy** if available, and use patient education to set expectations and reinforce adherence [^cebbe767] [^d9db53ea]. These non-pharmacologic measures are supported by guidelines and can meaningfully reduce itch and improve quality of life, especially when combined and sustained over time [^d9db53ea] [^07082fd2].

---

## Skin care and barrier repair

- **Emollients and moisturizers**: Liberal, frequent application of fragrance-free emollients (e.g. ceramide-containing creams) is recommended to restore the skin barrier and reduce itch, even when skin appears normal [^07082fd2] [^265a3e04].

- **Gentle skin care**: Use mild, fragrance-free cleansers; avoid hot water, harsh soaps, and vigorous rubbing; pat skin dry and apply moisturizer immediately after bathing [^265a3e04].

- **Water exposure management**: Limit bathing frequency and duration; consider using soap substitutes (e.g. emollient washes) to minimize barrier disruption [^265a3e04].

---

## Behavioral interventions

- **Habit reversal training**: Teach awareness of scratching triggers and replace scratching with competing behaviors (e.g. clenching fists, pressing palms) to break the itch–scratch cycle [^d9db53ea] [^c7a07451].

- **Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)**: CBT reduces itch intensity, anxiety, and sleep disturbance by addressing maladaptive thoughts and behaviors linked to scratching [^fac9a939] [^c7a07451].

- **Mindfulness and relaxation**: Mindfulness-based stress reduction and relaxation techniques (e.g. progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery) can reduce stress-related itch and improve sleep [^d9db53ea].

---

## Environmental modifications

Environmental modifications include **sleep hygiene** — using cool, humidified rooms; soft, breathable fabrics; and bedtime routines to reduce nocturnal itch and scratching [^notfound]. They also include **trigger avoidance** — identifying and minimizing personal triggers such as heat, sweat, allergens, and stressors [^cb4a8795].

---

## Physical therapies

Physical therapies include **phototherapy**, for which narrowband UVB is a guideline-supported option for refractory chronic pruritus, including CPUO, with antipruritic effects via neural modulation [^cebbe767] [^22564ff7]. Acupuncture may be considered as a second-line adjunct in generalized pruritus of unknown origin, though evidence is limited [^8702a4e6].

---

## Patient education and support

Patient education and support include **education** on chronic pruritus, the itch–scratch cycle, and the importance of adherence to skin care and behavioral strategies [^d9db53ea]. Support groups and counseling can address anxiety, depression, and social isolation, improving coping and quality of life [^c7a07451].

## Summary of non-pharmacologic interventions

| **Intervention category** | **Specific interventions** | **Evidence level** |
|-|-|-|
| Skin care | - Emollients <br/> - Gentle cleansing <br/> - Water exposure management | High [^07082fd2] [^265a3e04] |
| Behavioral | - Habit reversal <br/> - CBT <br/> - Mindfulness | Moderate [^d9db53ea] [^fac9a939] |
| Environmental | - Sleep hygiene <br/> - Trigger avoidance | Moderate [^d9db53ea] |
| Physical | - Phototherapy <br/> - Acupuncture | Moderate [^cebbe767] [^8702a4e6] |
| Education | - Patient education <br/> - Support groups | High [^d9db53ea] |

---

Non-pharmacologic management of chronic pruritus without visible lesions should be **multimodal**, combining barrier repair, behavioral strategies, and patient education, with phototherapy or acupuncture as adjuncts when needed. These interventions are guideline-supported, safe, and can significantly improve itch and quality of life when consistently applied [^d9db53ea] [^07082fd2].

Pruritus is the most common symptom of skin disease. Even in the absence of primary cutaneous findings, severe and extensive pruritus often is associated with systemic disease. This review considers briefly the physiology of pruritus and discusses the various systemic diseases often accompanied by this bothersome symptom. In addition to exploring the possible mechanisms and potential therapies of itching in selected disorders, this review presents general recommendations for evaluating patients with unexplained pruritus and management guidelines for alleviating their discomfort.

### Chronic pruritus in the absence of skin disease: pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment [^7c4345c7]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Chronic pruritus arises not only from dermatoses, but also, in up to half of cases, from extracutaneous origins. A multitude of systemic, neurological, psychiatric, and somatoform conditions are associated with pruritus in the absence of skin disease. Moreover, pruritus is a frequently observed side effect of many drugs. It is therefore difficult for physicians to make a correct diagnosis. Chronic pruritus patients frequently present to the dermatologist with skin lesions secondary to a long-lasting scratching behavior, such as lichenification and prurigo nodularis. A structured clinical history and physical examination are essential in order to evaluate the pruritus, along with systematic, medical history-adapted laboratory and radiological tests carried out according to the differential diagnosis. For therapeutic reasons, a symptomatic therapy should be promptly initiated parallel to the diagnostic procedures. Once the underlying factor(s) leading to the pruritus are identified, a targeted therapy should be implemented. Importantly, the treatment of accompanying disorders such as sleep disturbances or mental symptoms should be taken into consideration. Even after successful treatment of the underlying cause, pruritus may persist, likely due to chronicity processes including peripheral and central sensitization or impaired inhibition at spinal level. A vast arsenal of topical and systemic agents targeting these pathophysiological mechanisms has been used to deter further chronicity. The therapeutic options currently available are, however, still insufficient for many patients. Thus, future studies aiming to unveil the complex mechanisms underlying chronic pruritus and develop new therapeutic agents are urgently needed.

### Chronic pruritus in the absence of specific skin disease: an update on pathophysiology, diagnosis, and therapy [^49d5e997]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Chronic pruritus is a major and distressing symptom of many cutaneous and systemic diseases and can significantly impair the patient's quality of life. Pruritus perception is the final result of a complex network involving dedicated nerve pathways and brain areas, and an increasing number of peripheral and central mediators are thought to be involved. Itch is associated with most cutaneous disorders and, in these circumstances, its management overlaps with that of the skin disease. Itch can also occur without associated skin diseases or primary skin lesions, but only with nonspecific lesions secondary to rubbing or scratching. Chronic itch with no or minimal skin changes can be secondary to important diseases, such as neurologic disorders, chronic renal failure, cholestasis, systemic infections, malignancies, and endocrine disorders, and may also result from exposure to some drugs. The search for the cause of pruritus usually requires a meticulous step-by-step assessment involving careful history taking as well as clinical examination and laboratory investigations. Few evidence-based treatments for pruritus are available. Topical therapy, oral histamine H(1) receptor antagonists, and phototherapy with UV radiation can target pruritus elicitation in the skin, whereas antiepileptic drugs, opioid receptor antagonists, and antidepressants can block signal processing in the CNS.

### Interventions for chronic pruritus of unknown origin [^e95c35db]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Pruritus is a sensation that leads to the desire to scratch; its origin is unknown in 8% to 15% of affected patients. The prevalence of chronic pruritus of unknown origin (CPUO) in individuals with generalised pruritus ranges from 3.6% to 44.5%, with highest prevalence among the elderly. When the origin of pruritus is known, its management may be straightforward if an effective treatment for the causal disease is available. Treatment of CPUO is particularly difficult due to its unknown pathophysiology.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions for CPUO in adults and children.

Search Methods

We searched the following up to July 2019: Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and trials registries. We checked the reference lists of included studies for additional references to relevant trials.

Selection Criteria

We sought to include randomised controlled trials and quasi-randomised controlled trials that assessed interventions for CPUO, as defined in category VI ('Other pruritus of undetermined origin, or chronic pruritus of unknown origin') of the International Forum for the Study of Itch (IFSI) classification, in children and adults. Eligible interventions were non-pharmacological or topical or systemic pharmacological interventions, and eligible comparators were another active treatment, placebo, sham procedures, or no treatment or equivalent (e.g. waiting list).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were 'Patient- or parent-reported pruritus intensity' and 'Adverse events'. Our secondary outcomes were 'Health-related quality of life', 'Sleep disturbances', 'Depression', and 'Patient satisfaction'. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of evidence.

Main Results

We found there was an absence of evidence for the main interventions of interest: emollient creams, cooling lotions, topical corticosteroids, topical antidepressants, systemic antihistamines, systemic antidepressants, systemic anticonvulsants, and phototherapy. We included one study with 257 randomised (253 analysed) participants, aged 18 to 65 years; 60.6% were female. This study investigated the safety and efficacy of three different doses of oral serlopitant (5 mg, 1 mg, and 0.25 mg, once daily for six weeks) compared to placebo for severe chronic pruritus; 25 US centres participated (clinical research centres and universities). All outcomes were measured at the end of treatment (six weeks from baseline), except adverse events, which were monitored throughout. A pharmaceutical company funded this study. Fifty-five per cent of participants suffered from CPUO, and approximately 45% presented a dermatological diagnosis (atopic dermatitis/eczema 37.3%, psoriasis 6.7%, acne 3.6%, among other diagnoses). We unsuccessfully attempted to retrieve outcome data from study authors for the subgroup of participants with CPUO. Participants had pruritus for six weeks or longer. Total study duration was 10 weeks. Participants who received serlopitant 5 mg may have a greater rate of relief of patient-reported pruritus intensity as measured by the visual analogue scale (VAS; a reduction in VAS score indicates improvement) compared to placebo (126 participants, risk ratio (RR) 2.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.27 to 3.35; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effects of serlopitant 5 mg compared to placebo on the following outcomes due to very low-certainty evidence: adverse events (127 participants; RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.87 to 2.50); health-related quality of life (as measured by the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI); a higher score indicates greater impairment; 127 participants; mean difference (MD) -4.20, 95% CI -11.68 to 3.28); and sleep disturbances (people with insomnia measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Symptom Questionnaire-Insomnia (PSSQ-I), a dichotomous measure; 128 participants; RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.01). Participants who received serlopitant 1 mg may have a greater rate of relief of patient-reported pruritus intensity as measured by VAS compared to placebo; however, the 95% CI indicates that there may also be little to no difference between groups (126 participants; RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.54; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effects of serlopitant 1 mg compared to placebo on the following outcomes due to very low-certainty evidence: adverse events (128 participants; RR 1.45, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.47); health-related quality of life (DLQI; 128 participants; MD -6.90, 95% CI -14.38 to 0.58); and sleep disturbances (PSSQ-I; 128 participants; RR 0.38, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.84). Participants who received serlopitant 0.25 mg may have a greater rate of relief of patient-reported pruritus intensity as measured by VAS compared to placebo; however, the 95% CI indicates that there may also be little to no difference between groups (127 participants; RR 1.66, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.77; low-certainty evidence). We are uncertain of the effects of serlopitant 0.25 mg compared to placebo on the following outcomes due to very low-certainty evidence: adverse events (127 participants; RR 1.29, 95% CI 0.75 to 2.24); health-related quality of life (DLQI; 127 participants; MD -5.70, 95% CI -13.18 to 1.78); and sleep disturbances (PSSQ-I; 127 participants; RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.31 to 1.17). The most commonly reported adverse events were somnolence, diarrhoea, headache, and nasopharyngitis, among others. Our included study did not measure depression or patient satisfaction. We downgraded the certainty of evidence for all outcomes due to indirectness (only 55% of study participants had CPUO) and imprecision. We downgraded outcomes other than patient-reported pruritus intensity a further level due to concerns regarding risk of bias in selection of the reported result and some concerns with risk of bias due to missing outcome data (sleep disturbances only). We deemed risk of bias to be generally low.

Authors' Conclusions

We found lack of evidence to address our review question: for most of our interventions of interest, we found no eligible studies. The neurokinin 1 receptor (NK1R) antagonist serlopitant was the only intervention that we could assess. One study provided low-certainty evidence suggesting that serlopitant may reduce pruritus intensity when compared with placebo. We are uncertain of the effects of serlopitant on other outcomes, as certainty of the evidence is very low. More studies with larger sample sizes, focused on patients with CPUO, are needed. Healthcare professionals, patients, and other stakeholders may have to rely on indirect evidence related to other forms of chronic pruritus when deciding between the main interventions currently used for this condition.

### Innovative management of pruritus [^334abc54]. Dermatologic Clinics (2010). Low credibility.

Pruritus remains a significant problem facing dermatologists and can be associated with various dermatoses and systemic derangements. At times, one can treat the underlying cutaneous or systemic process to alleviate itch. However, it is frequently challenging to identify the cause of a patient's itch and, in this situation, even more difficult to manage the symptom effectively. In this article, the authors discuss the approach to a patient with generalized pruritus without clinically obvious dermatoses. They also addresses mechanisms and management modalities of itch in common systemic diseases, including cholestasis, uremia, and neuropathic dysfunction.

### Practice gaps in pruritus [^3f9585aa]. Dermatologic Clinics (2016). Low credibility.

There are several practice gaps in the evaluation and management of itch. These gaps include a dearth of objective measures of itch, infrequent use of validated patient-reported outcomes for itch, non-evidence-based treatment, and lack of consensus about the ideal workup for generalized itch. The present article reviews these gaps and presents potential solutions.

### Clinical aspects and management of chronic itch [^13c6013a]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2023). Medium credibility.

Chronic pruritus (CP) (ie, itch that persists for more than 6 weeks) poses significant challenges to patients' health and quality of life. It is a common reason for visits to dermatologists and general practitioners and can be caused by a range of conditions, including systemic diseases such as chronic kidney disease or liver diseases, malignancies, neuropathic conditions, and dermatoses such as atopic dermatitis. CP often does not develop in parallel with the course of the disease and can become an entity of its own, which must be treated with antipruritic drugs, even if the underlying cause is already under therapy. Depending on the etiology of CP, different pathways in the pathogenesis have been analyzed recently, following which new treatments have been developed and tested in randomized controlled trials. This article discusses the recent results of these studies and highlights how best to manage health care for patients with CP.

Conclusions

Regardless of the cause, patients with CP will benefit from the continuously increasing armamentarium of novel therapies. To a large extent, the expected progress is based on the flourishing data on CP pathophysiology, but, in the era of evidence-based medicine, another crucial factor (conscientious planning and execution of clinical trials) has to be taken into account. Thereby, therapeutic success, safety and economic issues will be maintained in real-life settings.

### Systemic therapies for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: expert perspectives in practice [^5d52d206]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects around 13% of children and 7% of adults in the US. It can have a significant impact on the quality of life (QoL) of affected individuals due to pruritus and the visibility of lesions on the skin. AD is increasingly recognized as a systemic disease, since dysregulation of the adaptive and innate immune systems plays a key role in the underlying disease pathogenesis, which has important implications for how the condition is treated. Patients with moderate-to-severe disease who have failed to achieve disease control may benefit from systemic immunomodulatory treatments. Recently published expert perspectives outlined recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of moderate-to-severe AD in adults, reflecting evidence-based, practical recommendations to support allergists and dermatologists in selecting appropriate treatment in the era of biologic therapies. To help clinicians understand how these practical recommendations can be implemented into clinical practice, we describe two real life case studies of adult patients with AD. In these case studies, we demonstrate how AD severity, treatment response, and treatment failure can be assessed, and the role of emerging systemic treatments in the management of moderate-to-severe AD.

### Systemic causes of non-dermatologic chronic pruritus in the pediatric population and their management: an unexplored area [^3ffb53d8]. Pediatric Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Chronic pruritus associated with systemic diseases in the pediatric population has been infrequently addressed in the literature. This review focuses on chronic pruritus presenting without cutaneous manifestations. Common systemic etiologies include diseases with hepatic, renal, and hematologic origins. This encompasses several congenital liver disorders, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and lymphoproliferative disorders such as Hodgkin's lymphoma. In this paper, an expert panel describes the clinical characteristics, pathophysiology, and therapeutic treatment ladders for chronic pruritus associated with the aforementioned systemic etiologies. Novel therapies are also reviewed. Our aim is to shed light on this unexplored area of pediatric dermatology and instigate further research.

### Pruritus: diagnosis and management [^6e558066]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Pruritus is the sensation of itching; it can be caused by dermatologic and systemic conditions. An exposure history may reveal symptom triggers. A thorough skin examination, including visualization of the finger webs, anogenital region, nails, and scalp, is essential. Primary skin lesions indicate diseased skin, and secondary lesions are reactive and result from skin manipulation, such as scratching. An initial evaluation for systemic causes may include a complete blood count with differential, creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, liver function tests, iron studies, fasting glucose or A1C level, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. Additional testing, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, HIV screening, hepatitis serologies, and chest radiography, may also be appropriate based on the history and physical examination. In the absence of primary skin lesions, physicians should consider evaluation for malignancy in older patients with chronic generalized pruritus. General management includes trigger avoidance, liberal emollient use, limiting water exposure, and administration of oral antihistamines and topical corticosteroids. If the evaluation for multiple etiologies of pruritus is ambiguous, clinicians may consider psychogenic etiologies and consultation with a specialist.

1 INTRODUCTION

Itch, also known as pruritus, is defined as an uncomfortable sensation that provokes an urge to scratch.It impairs the quality of life (QOL) of those experiencing itch and can be debilitating and even lethal when it becomes severe and/or chronic.Therefore, dermatologists and physicians who see patients with itch must be knowledgeable about it. This review will provide an overview of the pathophysiology and treatment strategies for itch, with a particular focus on itch with no underlying primary pruritic skin disease.

### Emerging therapeutic options for chronic pruritus [^3f60f424]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic pruritus, defined as an unpleasant sensation resulting in a need to scratch that lasts more than 6 weeks, is a prevalent and bothersome symptom associated with both cutaneous and systemic conditions. Due to complex pathogenesis and profuse contributing factors, chronic pruritus therapy remains challenging. Regardless of the well-established antipruritic properties of classic pharmacotherapy (topical therapy, phototherapy and systemic therapy), these methods often provide insufficient relief for affected individuals. Owing to the growing interest in the field of pruritic research, further experimental and clinical data have emerged, continuously supporting the possibility of instigating novel therapeutic measures. This review covers the most relevant current modalities remaining under investigation that possess promising perspectives of approval in the near future, especially opioidergic drugs (mu-opioid antagonists and kappa-opioid agonists), neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists, biologic drugs, Janus kinase inhibitors, ileal bile acid transporter inhibitors, aryl hydrocarbon receptor agonists and histamine H 4 receptor antagonists.

### Pain care for patients with epidermolysis bullosa: best care practice guidelines [^f4267f79]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Itch is a prominent, debilitating and damaging symptom for children with EB, but the mechanisms which lead to the manifestation of pruritus are poorly understood. Promising new insights into the causes and potential treatments of chronic itch in animal models, in human chronic itch generally and in recovering burn patients may hold potential for application in the EB population.

Non-pharmacological approaches

Multiple environmental and behavioral approaches to address itch have been suggested, and include: prevention of dry skin (systemic hydration and emollients), gentle debridement of dry/dead/crusted skin, prevention and treatment of skin wound infection; maintaining/supporting the healing process by attention to anemia and nutritional status, limiting damage to the skin by avoiding shear forces imposed by scratching (short nails, occlusive barriers, patting rather than pulling or tearing at a site), avoiding overheating and using measures to keep the body cool (see Box 10). CBT is useful to reduce habitual scratching behaviors (see section on psychological approaches). It is important to avoid and treat secondary causes when present (such as drugs, environmental itch triggers, underlying co-morbidities). Opioid-induced itch in EB can be a problem and a difficult side effect to balance against the desired analgesia; opioid rotation may be helpful.

### Alternative therapy in pruritus [^823e693e]. Dermatologic Therapy (2003). Low credibility.

Because of its multitude of origins, the symptom complex of pruritus has a plethora of purported remedies and few therapeutic indications. Very few topical and systemic FDA approved medications have the indication of pruritus. Specific therapy still awaits a better definition of the exact physiologic events in chronic pruritus. Hence most medications actually focus on the central nervous system--the peripheral receptors--and the lack of specific physiologic targets has inhibited pharmacologic development. The resulting gap has opened the door to a variety of alternative therapies.

### Chronic itch management: therapies beyond those targeting the immune system [^7c498aa4]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective

Chronic itch can be a debilitating, unrelenting symptom. Over the years, we have advanced our knowledge about immune-mediated itch (eg, atopic dermatitis) and have developed several treatments targeting these immune pathways. Chronic itch that is noninflammatory in nature is more elusive. However, we have gained some understanding of the neural component mediating itch and have made progress in treating this challenging symptom.

Data Sources

A comprehensive literature search was conducted, and data and literature were reviewed on the topics of chronic itch, its pathophysiology, and nonimmunological treatments for chronic itch that work on the nerves.

Study Selections

Basic science papers, review articles, case reports, and clinical trial data were considered.

Results

A variety of topical and systemic therapies targeting the nerves have shown effectiveness in treating patients with chronic itch of different types.

Conclusion

Treating chronic itch may be challenging, but an arsenal of treatments are available and many are on the horizon as we expand our knowledge of mechanisms of itch and the neural receptors involved.

### Practical approaches for diagnosis and management of prurigo nodularis: United States expert panel consensus [^95a4800b]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic disease characterized by intensely pruritic, raised, nodular lesions. Because there are currently no United States Food and Drug Administration-approved therapies specifically for PN, management is highly variable, and no consensus exists on treatment regimens.

Objective

To provide practical guidance to help United States dermatologists diagnose and effectively treat patients with PN.

Methods

We participated in a roundtable discussion to develop consensus recommendations on diagnosis and treatment of PN from a United States perspective.

Results

The core findings in PN are the presence of firm, nodular lesions; pruritus lasting at least 6 weeks; and a history or signs, or both, of repeated scratching, picking, or rubbing. The diagnostic workup involves a complete review of systems, considering potential systemic diseases, and assessment of disease severity, including disease burden and pruritus intensity. Treatment should be selected based on a patient's clinical presentation, comorbidities, and response to prior treatments and should address both neural and immunologic components of pruritus.

Limitations

Data on PN are from anecdotal or small clinical trials, and all treatments are currently used off-label.

Conclusion

An effective treatment approach for patients with PN should be based on clinical judgment and tailored to the individual needs of the patient.

### Itch in systemic disease: therapeutic options [^f348e5c9]. Dermatologic Therapy (2005). Low credibility.

A new pathophysiologically based classification of itch is proposed, which should help the clinician adopt a rational approach to diagnosis and management of generalized itch. Focusing on neurogenic itch (itch without visible rash), common causes are reviewed and guidelines for laboratory and radiologic investigation are proposed. A stepwise approach to the management of generalized itch resulting from systemic disease is recommended. Specifically, the relative merits of broad versus narrowband ultraviolet B (UVB) are discussed and the pros and cons of doxepin, opioid antagonists, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as paroxetine are considered. Attention is drawn to some novel approaches, including bright-light phototherapy and molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS) for selected patients with intractable itch caused by hepatic failure, and mirtazapine for nocturnal itch.

### Practical guidelines for the use of steroid-sparing agents in the treatment of chronic pruritus [^67aed32a]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Chronic pruritus in the adult patient is both an underappreciated and a difficult to treat condition. In the vast majority of cases, itch is the result of inflammatory skin disease and therefore may be responsive to systemic anti-inflammatory therapies. Urticarial dermatitis is an under-recognized cause of chronic itch in the adult population. Patients with this disorder are characterized by prolonged, prednisone-responsive pruritus, often in the absence of substantial cutaneous findings. Skin findings, when present, can range from subtle, persistent urticarial lesions to excoriated papules, often intermixed with urticaria, eczematous change, and lichenification secondary to chronic scratching. Hereby, we describe our algorithm for evaluation and management of adult patients with refractory pruritus (urticarial dermatitis in particular), including evaluation for other etiologies of pruritus, pre-immunosuppression workup, and the use of azathioprine and other steroid-sparing agents for treatment of recalcitrant itch.

### Psychogenic pruritus and its management [^19019e88]. Dermatologic Clinics (2018). Low credibility.

Chronic itching can be frustrating for patients and providers, and patients are not always willing to accept that their psychiatric health has an impact on their skin. Psychogenic pruritus is defined as itch not related to dermatologic or systemic causes. When a patient presents with pruritus, regardless of the presumed cause, the standard work-up should include a thorough history, dermatologic examination, and laboratory examinations or biopsies as needed. If no medical source is found, the provider must work in partnership with the patient to explore other causes and that may include acknowledging and treating underlying psychiatric conditions.

### Practical guide for the diagnosis and treatment of localized and generalized cutaneous pruritus (chronic itch with no underlying pruritic dermatosis) [^a55ad562]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Itch, also known as pruritus, is one of the most prevalent symptoms observed in dermatological practices. Itch frequently arises from primary pruritic dermatoses, although it may also manifest in the absence of a primary pruritic skin rash. The latter itchy condition is referred to as "cutaneous pruritus" in the Japanese guidelines published in 2020. Cutaneous pruritus can be classified into two categories based on its distribution: localized cutaneous pruritus and generalized cutaneous pruritus. Localized cutaneous pruritus is indicative of a neuropathic cause, whereas generalized cutaneous pruritus suggests underlying systemic disease(s), drug-induced itch, psychogenic itch (also known as functional itch disorder), or chronic pruritus of unknown origin (CPUO). Systemic diseases associated with cutaneous pruritus include disorders of iron metabolism, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease (especially cholestasis), endocrine/metabolic diseases, hematological disorders, and malignant solid tumors. CPUO is a term used to describe chronic itch that is often generalized and for which no underlying cause can be identified despite a comprehensive and careful diagnostic workup. A variety of treatment approaches are available for cutaneous pruritus, including device-based physical therapies (such as phototherapy) and medications that act on the itch-perception processing pathway from the skin, peripheral sensory nerves, the spinal cord, to the brain. This review presents an overview of the current knowledge regarding cutaneous pruritus, from its underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms to the diagnostic procedures and treatment approaches that are currently available.

### The 2024 British Society for Rheumatology guideline for management of systemic sclerosis [^ede78f6c]. Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Guideline recommendation for non-fibrotic skin manifestations in SSc:

Practical approaches, maintaining adequately moisturized skin, are essential. It is strongly recommended to avoid frequent bathing with harsh deodorant soaps, and emollients should be used as soap substitutes where possible (2C, 97%).
Itch is associated with disease activity and so other disease-targeted treatment may result in improvement. Anti-pruritic moisturizers and antihistamines are often used for itch, and the sedative effects of the latter agents may be beneficial at night-time. In adults, expert opinion suggests low-dose opioid antagonists such as naloxone and naltrexone, and other options including gabapentin and pregabalin and low-dose antidepressants such as mirtazapine may be considered (2C, 89%).
Current management options for telangiectasia include (green) skin camouflage and injected sclerosing agents or thermocoagulation methods such as pulsed dye laser or intense pulsed light therapy (2C, 95%).
Consider autologous fat transfer for facial fat loss (2C, 89%).

Musculoskeletal disease, fatigue and quality of life

SSc has a major impact on daily activity. Key to this is disease-related fatigue as well as musculoskeletal complications including arthropathy, contractures, muscle weakness and debilitating mechanical musculoskeletal pain. These non-lethal burdensome aspects of the disease have substantial negative impact on quality of life. In this guideline we have considered management of musculoskeletal disease. It is noted that in overlap jSSc-arthritis may be more frequent than in adult-onset SSc.

Musculoskeletal manifestations

What is the management for musculoskeletal manifestations of SSc?

Musculoskeletal involvement includes tendinopathy, joint contractures and, in some cases, overlap arthritis. Chronic widespread pain and associated features are not uncommon. Management advice is to consider and treat both inflammatory tendon and joint disease and non-inflammatory causes.

Guideline Recommendation for musculoskeletal manifestations in SSc:

Musculoskeletal manifestations of SSc may benefit from immunomodulatory treatments given for other complications, such as skin disease (1C, 95%).
When arthritis or myositis (or non-inflammatory musculoskeletal pain) is more severe, generally in the context of an overlap SSc syndrome, management is in line with similar clinical conditions occurring outside the context of SSc (1C, 93%).

### Management of itch in atopic dermatitis [^f176d954]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common itchy dermatosis that affects millions of children and adults worldwide. Chronic itch in this condition has significant impact on measures of quality of life, such as sleep. Treating itch in AD has been challenging for decades, but new drugs have emerged in the last year with significant anti-pruritic effect. The optimal treatment regimen for atopic itch addresses barrier dysfunction, inflammation, neural hypersensitivity, and the itch-scratch cycle. Topical moisturizers remain the foundation of treatment and should be used by all patients with AD-associated pruritus. Step-wise therapy, from topical anti-inflammatory creams to systemic monoclonal antibodies and immunosuppressants, is recommended. There are multiple adjuvant therapies that can be used, especially to target itch in the setting of minimal skin inflammation. Finally, patient education, sleep management, and stress relief are important components to optimize outcomes. This review assesses the latest advances and treatment recommendations for pruritus in AD. Finally, suggested therapeutic ladders and emerging treatments are discussed.

### INDIVIDUAL ARTICLE: management of prurigo nodularis [^2671833f]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Prurigo nodularis (PN) is a chronic disease characterized by intense pruritus and nodular lesions associated with reduced quality of life. Until recently, no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapies have been available for the management of PN. Treatment regimens have been highly variable and clinical management guidelines are lacking overall; formal treatment guidelines do not exist within the US. In 2022, dupilumab became the first FDA-approved medication for PN. Multiple novel agents that target the neuroimmune underpinnings of the disease are currently in development and show promise for this challenging disorder.

Objective

To review current treatments and emerging therapies for effective management of patients with PN.

Methods

We reviewed publications on PN management identified from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library. We also included publicly available data on clinical trials for PN therapies reported on the US National Library of Medicine ClinicalTrials.gov, the International Conference on Harmonisation-Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) Database, and the European Clinical Trials (EudraCT) Database.

Results

The recommended management of PN begins with an assessment of disease severity, including disease burden and pruritus intensity, and evaluation of comorbid medical disorders. Treatment goals include resolution of itch, improvement in nodules or cutaneous lesions, and improvement in quality of life. Therapies should be selected based on a patient&rsquo;s clinical presentation and comorbidities. Treatment should simultaneously address the neural and immunologic components of PN. Combination therapy, particularly with conventional agents, may be beneficial.

Limitations

Data on most conventional PN treatments are limited to anecdotal reports, small clinical trials, or expert consensus recommendations. No head-to-head comparative trials have evaluated the relative efficacy of conventional and/or emerging agents, or combination therapy.

Conclusion

An effective treatment approach for patients with PN should reduce pruritus, allow nodular lesions to heal, and improve individual quality of life. The treatment landscape for PN is rapidly evolving with one FDA-approved agent and several new promising therapies on the horizon. J Drugs Dermatol. 2023;22:12(Suppl 2):s15-22.

### Diagnostic and treatment algorithm for chronic nodular prurigo [^e4d7a7e1]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Chronic nodular prurigo (CNPG) is a subtype of chronic prurigo, also called prurigo nodularis, and a chronic skin condition characterized by intensely pruritic nodular lesions. Although the exact cause of CNPG is unknown, it appears to result from a repetitive itch-scratch cycle induced by neuronal sensitization to chronic pruritus. CNPG is associated with an underlying dermatologic condition in about half of patients, and it can also be attributed to systemic, neurologic, psychogenic, or unknown causes. For most patients, multiple underlying causes are identified. Patients with CNPG often experience impaired quality of life, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and depression. To encourage consistent and accurate diagnosis and treatment of CNPG across regions, we are proposing a diagnostic and treatment algorithm that includes initial assessment of core symptoms, detailed dermatologic history and clinical examination, patient-reported outcomes, diagnostic workup, and recommended therapies. This information is supplemented with photographs to illustrate clinical appearance and disease severity. Because CNPG is often multifactorial and it can take months to years for lesions to heal, interdisciplinary cooperation and long-term management are important.

Chronic pruritus (>6 week's duration) in the geriatric population (≥65 years old), is an increasing health care problem. The pathophysiologic predisposing factors are abnormalities of the epidermal barrier, immune system, and nervous system. Causes can be dichotomized into histaminergic and nonhistaminergic pruritus. Topical treatments are generally safe. Systemic treatments are chosen depending on the condition, comorbid diseases, and drug interactions. Treatment options are limited. Progress has been made in identifying itch-selective mediators over the last decade. Numerous new medications are currently undergoing clinical trials and they are anticipated to enter the clinics in the near future.

Efficacy of psychological interventions in chronic and acute pain management

Psychological therapies have been shown to be effective in decreasing pain intensity and frequency in other pediatric chronic pain conditions, with emerging evidence showing improvement in pain-related functional disability as well,. The addition of biofeedback to relaxation training does not necessarily result in superior pain outcomes. Modest data support the use of CBT in adults with chronic pain and disability (see Box 1).

Psychological interventions are useful for the management of acute pediatric pain (see Box 1) although evidence for their efficacy varies depending on the type of pain. For procedure related pain, particularly needle procedures, distraction, hypnosis and CBT are effective, evidence based interventions -.

In a review of non-pharmacological treatments to reduce the distress due to acute wound care in burn patients, some evidence has been shown that healthcare provider interventions (massage and maximizing patient control and predictability), child interventions (for example, virtual reality gaming and therapist coaching of stress management techniques) are beneficial.

For postoperative pain, there is insufficient evidence for the efficacy of most psychological interventions, but preparation, guided imagery and CBT are promising.

Psychological interventions for itch

Patients with EB may experience severe itch, which not only intensifies their suffering but can also be a source of social embarrassment secondary to the appearance of the excoriated skin and the preoccupation with scratching in social situations. Beyond this, damage of the integrity of the skin can create a portal of entry for systemic infections. Regardless of the underlying cause, itch evokes the behavior of scratching that increases inflammation and stimulates nerve fibers, leading to more itching and scratching. Perpetuation of the itch-scratch cycle alters the integrity of skin leading to barrier damage. Scratching also causes undesirable changes in skin, such as lichenification and prurigo nodule formation. Successful treatment of itch requires interruption of this cycle. Non-pharmacological treatments, such as CBT, hypnosis, meditation, prayer, biofeedback and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), have been used with some success in both adults and children with conditions such as atopic dermatitis. Habit reversal is a specific behavioral intervention whereby habitual behaviors are brought into conscious awareness and specific behavioral techniques are developed as a competing response to the urge to itch, (see Box 1). In practice, this technique is frequently combined with CBT and relaxation as part of a treatment package applicable to patients of all ages,.

### Emerging therapeutic options for chronic pruritus [^05c3b547]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic pruritus (CP), defined as an unpleasant sensation resulting in a need to scratch that lasts more than 6 weeks, is a prevalent and bothersome symptom associated with cutaneous conditions (such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis [AD], lichen planus [LP], etc.); however, primarily extracutaneous ailments may also play a role in the occurrence of CP. Prominent examples of the latter include end-stage renal disease (ESRD), diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, chronic hepatobiliary conditions, or malignancies, to name just a few. The etiology of CP may be comprehensively classified as dermatologic, systemic, neurologic, psychogenic, mixed or unknown. Therefore, physicians other than dermatologists also frequently encounter this phenomenon in both outpatient and clinical settings. The burden of CP stems from a marked decrease in various domains of health-related quality of life (HRQoL).

### Joint AAD-NPF guidelines of care for the management and treatment of psoriasis with topical therapy and alternative medicine modalities for psoriasis severity measures [^fc01fee1]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2021). High credibility.

Pruritus assessment in psoriasis—Pruritus is a significant symptom of psoriasis and is often under-recognized, and itch severity assessment is recommended for patients whose psoriasis causes significant pruritus because it can have a major impact on a patient’s quality of life. The visual analog scale (VAS) and numeric rating scale (NRS) are 2 of the most commonly used pruritus assessment tools, but at this time there is no recommendation on which tool should be used due to limited evidence, and when using these 2 scales the minimal clinically important difference should be 3 to 4 points for a change to be considered meaningful.

### Chronic pain management in dermatology: a guide to assessment and nonopioid pharmacotherapy [^146c0ea6]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2015). Low credibility.

Pain is a central component of illness and suffering, yet unfortunately it is frequently undertreated. In dermatology, many acute and chronic conditions are characterized by pain that may require therapeutic intervention in addition to medical treatment aimed at treating the primary disease. To date, however, there are limited recommendations or evidence in the published literature on pain and pain management strategies for patients with skin disease. In an effort to enable providers to more comprehensively and effectively treat chronic pain in the primary and multidisciplinary dermatologic context, these topics will be discussed in this 2-part continuing medical education article. Part I of this series will describe important mechanisms of pain and detail individualized chronic pain assessment and treatment strategies using nonopioid analgesia.

### Pain care for patients with epidermolysis bullosa: best care practice guidelines [^b43cb5a2]. BMC Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Systemic approaches

The pharmacological treatment of skin and wound pain is non-specific, with no evidence in the EB population to promote one treatment over another. NSAIDs, acetaminophen, tramadol and opioids are used with success. Cannabinoids have some anecdotal support. Itch is a major problem (see below) that can lead to increased scratching and subsequent development of painful wounds. Hence, managing pruritus is important to prevent wound-related pain.

Many patients with severe types of EB use long-acting opioid preparations to provide a basal comfort level. Of note, there are no clear guidelines that long-acting opioids are preferable to use of intermittent opioids for non-cancer pain, although there is modest evidence for opioid use, in general, for non-cancer pain in adults,. Individualization of therapy is recommended.

Regular and frequent dosing of opioids is common and merits special attention. Regardless of the opioid chosen, chronic use of opioids may have endocrinologic effects, such as hypogonadism. Monitoring should be considered, especially given the propensity for osteopenia and delayed puberty in adolescents and young adults with EB. In the absence of data, the use of opioids is recommended as clinically indicated (see Box 3).

Methadone merits particular consideration. Dose titration can be unpredictable due to long and variable half-life as well as to saturable plasma protein binding. The long and variable half-life, as well as the risk of methadone-induced prolonged QT syndrome,, mandates care in its use alone and with other drugs that may also prolong the QT interval. Guidelines on electrocardiographic screening are limited (especially for adult patients of smaller stature and children). Given the risk of prolonged QT and methadone’s complex and variable pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that methadone only be prescribed by practitioners with experience evaluating and monitoring its use. Methadone use is, therefore, best done with input from a pain management and/or palliative care specialist.

### Pharmacological interventions for pruritus in adult palliative care patients [^e13033de]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of the original Cochrane review published in 2013 (Issue 6). Pruritus occurs in patients with disparate underlying diseases and is caused by different pathologic mechanisms. In palliative care patients, pruritus is not the most prevalent but is one of the most puzzling symptoms. It can cause considerable discomfort and affects patients' quality of life.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different pharmacological treatments for preventing or treating pruritus in adult palliative care patients.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), and MEDLINE (OVID) up to 9 June 2016 and Embase (OVID) up to 7 June 2016. In addition, we searched trial registries and checked the reference lists of all relevant studies, key textbooks, reviews and websites, and we contacted investigators and specialists in pruritus and palliative care regarding unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of different pharmacological treatments, compared with a placebo, no treatment, or an alternative treatment, for preventing or treating pruritus in palliative care patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the identified titles and abstracts, performed data extraction and assessed the risk of bias and methodological quality. We summarised the results descriptively and quantitatively (meta-analyses) according to the different pharmacological interventions and the diseases associated with pruritus. We assessed the evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) and created 10 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

In total, we included 50 studies and 1916 participants in the review. We added 10 studies with 627 participants for this update. Altogether, we included 39 different treatments for pruritus in four different patient groups.The overall risk of bias profile was heterogeneous and ranged from high to low risk. However, 48 studies (96%) had a high risk of bias due to low sample size (i.e. fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm). Using GRADE criteria, we downgraded our judgement on the quality of evidence to moderate in seven and to low in three comparisons for our primary outcome (pruritus), mainly due to imprecision and risk of bias.In palliative care participants with pruritus of different nature, the treatment with the drug paroxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, reduced pruritus by 0.78 points (numerical analogue scale from 0 to 10; 95% confidence interval (CI) -1.19 to -0.37; one RCT, N = 48, quality of evidence: moderate) compared to placebo.For participants suffering from uraemic pruritus (UP), gabapentin was more effective than placebo (visual analogue scale (VAS): 0 to 10), mean difference (MD) -5.91, 95% CI -6.87 to -4.96; two RCTs, N = 118, quality of evidence: moderate). The κ-opioid receptor agonist nalfurafine showed amelioration of UP (VAS 0 to 10, MD -0.95, 95% CI -1.32 to -0.58; three RCTs, N = 422, quality of evidence: moderate) and only few adverse events. Moreover, cromolyn sodium relieved UP participants from pruritus by 2.94 points on the VAS (0 to 10) (95% CI -4.04 to -1.83; two RCTs, N = 100, quality of evidence: moderate) compared to placebo.In participants with cholestatic pruritus (CP), data favoured rifampin (VAS: 0 to 100, MD -24.64, 95% CI -31.08 to -18.21; two RCTs, N = 42, quality of evidence: low) and flumecinol (RR > 1 favours treatment group; RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.39; two RCTs, N = 69, quality of evidence: low) and showed a low incidence of adverse events in comparison with placebo. The opioid antagonist naltrexone reduced pruritus for participants with CP (VAS: 0 to 10, MD -2.26, 95% CI -3.19 to -1.33; two RCTs, N = 52, quality of evidence: moderate) compared to placebo. However, effects in participants with UP were inconclusive (percentage difference -12.30%, 95% CI -25.82% to 1.22%, one RCT, N = 32). Furthermore, large doses of opioid antagonists (e.g. naltrexone) could be inappropriate in palliative care patients because of the risk of reducing analgesia.For participants with HIV-associated pruritus, it is uncertain whether drug treatment with hydroxyzine hydrochloride, pentoxifylline, triamcinolone or indomethacin reduces pruritus because the evidence was of very low quality (e.g. small sample size, lack of blinding).

Authors' Conclusions

Different interventions tended to be effective for CP and UP. However, therapies for patients with malignancies are still lacking. Due to the small sample sizes in most meta-analyses and the heterogeneous methodological quality of the included trials, the results should be interpreted cautiously in terms of generalisability.

Conclusions

Pruritus is a common symptom in patients with PBC and may be exacerbated by PBC pharmacotherapy. OCA has shown a sustained efficacy and safety profile at 48 months, effectively improving liver biochemical parameters in PBC.Pruritus associated with OCA therapy is dose-dependent and often manageable, and clinical studies show that treatment discontinuation can be minimised when pruritus is managed effectively. There are a variety of measures that HCPs can put into place to manage and improve pruritus, to ensure maintenance of OCA and optimal disease outcomes. Individualised management strategies include close patient follow-up, non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments available to manage treatment-related pruritus, and titration of OCA dosing as necessary, based on clinical judgement. While severe pruritus can be a challenge to continued therapy, it can be successfully managed in most patients, to help ensure the continuation of treatment. Effective and successful management of PBC depends on timely initiation of and continued adherence to pharmacotherapy to avoid disease progression.With education and personalised patient care, physicians can help improve pruritus symptoms and treatment adherence for optimal disease management.

### Atopic dermatitis guidelines: diagnosis, systemic therapy, and adjunctive care [^48a07864]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis is an important and chronic skin condition that has recently been the subject of enormous volumes of basic science, clinical, and epidemiologic research. This field is undergoing rapid expansion, making it vitally important to integrate the emerging data with our current body of knowledge. In 2014, the American Academy of Dermatology published Guidelines of Care for the Management of Atopic Dermatitis, composed of four parts, reflecting the work of 17 experts from North America and the United Kingdom. 1-4 It uses a patient-oriented system, SORT (Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy), to provide evidence-based guidance in the management of this common, vexing dermatitis. These guidelines join a series of similar efforts published recently across the world, reflecting universal interest in distilling the tremendous volume of basic scientific and clinical data previously generated. 5-7 With new therapies rapidly emerging, clinicians require a current understanding of the field to be able to incorporate new treatments in their practice.

### Chronic prurigo including prurigo nodularis: new insights and treatments [^02329f72]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

We conducted a PubMed search of all publications since 1982 (531 results with the term ‘chronic prurigo’; 1680 results with the term ‘prurigo’ in August 2023) and a database search of current clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, EU Clinical Trials Register [European Medicines Agency], using the following terms or combinations of terms: ‘chronic prurigo’, ‘prurigo’, ‘prurigo nodularis’, ‘pathophysiology’, ‘therapy’, ‘biologics’, ‘treatment’). A systematic literature review was performed to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) according to the Cochrane recommendations. As of August 2023, the following studies could be found with the term ‘prurigo’:
ClinicalTrials.gov: 34 results (22 of these were considered in this review).
EU Clinical Trials Register: 24 results (16 of these were considered in this review).

### Pharmacological interventions for pruritus in adult palliative care patients [^f1d72553]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the second update of the original Cochrane review published in 2013 (issue 6), which was updated in 2016 (issue 11). Pruritus occurs in patients with disparate underlying diseases and is caused by different pathologic mechanisms. In palliative care patients, pruritus is not the most prevalent but is a burdening symptom. It can cause considerable discomfort and negatively affect patients' quality of life.

Objectives

To assess the effects of different pharmacological treatments compared with active control or placebo for preventing or treating pruritus in adult palliative care patients.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE (OVID) and Embase (OVID) up to 6 July 2022. In addition, we searched trial registries and checked the reference lists of all relevant studies, key textbooks, reviews and websites, and we contacted investigators and specialists in pruritus and palliative care regarding unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effects of different pharmacological treatments, compared with a placebo, no treatment, or an alternative treatment, for preventing or treating pruritus in palliative care patients.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed the identified titles and abstracts, performed data extraction and assessed the risk of bias and methodological quality. We summarised the results descriptively and quantitatively (meta-analyses) according to the different pharmacological interventions and the diseases associated with pruritus. We assessed the evidence using GRADE and created 13 summary of findings tables.

Main Results

In total, we included 91 studies and 4652 participants in the review. We added 42 studies with 2839 participants for this update. Altogether, we included 51 different treatments for pruritus in four different patient groups. The overall risk of bias profile was heterogeneous and ranged from high to low risk. The main reason for giving a high risk of bias rating was a small sample size (fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm). Seventy-nine of 91 studies (87%) had fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm. Eight (9%) studies had low risk of bias in the specified key domains; the remaining studies had an unclear risk of bias (70 studies, 77%) or a high risk of bias (13 studies, 14%). Using GRADE criteria, we judged that the certainty of evidence for the primary outcome (i.e. pruritus) was high for kappa-opioid agonists compared to placebo and moderate for GABA-analogues compared to placebo. Certainty of evidence was low for naltrexone, fish-oil/omega-3 fatty acids, topical capsaicin, ondansetron and zinc sulphate compared to placebo and gabapentin compared to pregabalin, and very low for cromolyn sodium, paroxetine, montelukast, flumecinol, and rifampicin compared to placebo. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence mainly due to serious study limitations regarding risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency. For participants suffering from uraemic pruritus (UP; also known as chronic kidney disease (CKD)-associated pruritus (CKD-aP)), treatment with GABA-analogues compared to placebo likely resulted in a large reduction of pruritus (visual analogue scale (VAS) 0 to 10 cm): mean difference (MD) -5.10, 95% confidence interval (CI) -5.56 to -4.55; five RCTs, N = 297, certainty of evidence: moderate. Treatment with kappa-opioid receptor agonists (difelikefalin, nalbuphine, nalfurafine) compared to placebo reduced pruritus slightly (VAS 0 to 10 cm, MD -0.96, 95% CI -1.22 to -0.71; six RCTs, N = 1292, certainty of evidence: high); thus, this treatment was less effective than GABA-analogues. Treatment with montelukast compared to placebo may result in a reduction of pruritus, but the evidence is very uncertain (two studies, 87 participants): SMD -1.40, 95% CI -1.87 to -0.92; certainty of evidence: very low. Treatment with fish-oil/omega-3 fatty acids compared to placebo may result in a large reduction of pruritus (four studies, 160 observations): SMD -1.60, 95% CI -1.97 to -1.22; certainty of evidence: low. Treatment with cromolyn sodium compared to placebo may result in a reduction of pruritus, but the evidence is very uncertain (VAS 0 to 10 cm, MD -3.27, 95% CI -5.91 to -0.63; two RCTs, N = 100, certainty of evidence: very low). Treatment with topical capsaicin compared with placebo may result in a large reduction of pruritus (two studies; 112 participants): SMD -1.06, 95% CI -1.55 to -0.57; certainty of evidence: low. Ondansetron, zinc sulphate and several other treatments may not reduce pruritus in participants suffering from UP. In participants with cholestatic pruritus (CP), treatment with rifampicin compared to placebo may reduce pruritus, but the evidence is very uncertain (VAS: 0 to 100, MD -42.00, 95% CI -87.31 to 3.31; two RCTs, N = 42, certainty of evidence: very low). Treatment with flumecinol compared to placebo may reduce pruritus, but the evidence is very uncertain (RR > 1 favours treatment group; RR 2.32, 95% CI 0.54 to 10.1; two RCTs, N = 69, certainty of evidence: very low). Treatment with the opioid antagonist naltrexone compared to placebo may reduce pruritus (VAS: 0 to 10 cm, MD -2.42, 95% CI -3.90 to -0.94; two RCTs, N = 52, certainty of evidence: low). However, effects in participants with UP were inconclusive (percentage of difference -12.30%, 95% CI -25.82% to 1.22%, one RCT, N = 32). In palliative care participants with pruritus of a different nature, the treatment with the drug paroxetine (one study), a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, compared to placebo may reduce pruritus slightly by 0.78 (numerical analogue scale from 0 to 10 points; 95% CI -1.19 to -0.37; one RCT, N = 48, certainty of evidence: low). Most adverse events were mild or moderate. Two interventions showed multiple major adverse events (naltrexone and nalfurafine).

Authors Conclusions

Different interventions (GABA-analogues, kappa-opioid receptor agonists, cromolyn sodium, montelukast, fish-oil/omega-3 fatty acids and topical capsaicin compared to placebo) were effective for uraemic pruritus. GABA-analogues had the largest effect on pruritus. Rifampin, naltrexone and flumecinol tended to be effective for cholestatic pruritus. However, therapies for patients with malignancies are still lacking. Due to the small sample sizes in most meta-analyses and the heterogeneous methodological quality of the included trials, the results should be interpreted cautiously in terms of generalisability.

### Practical guide for the diagnosis and treatment of localized and generalized cutaneous pruritus (chronic itch with no underlying pruritic dermatosis) [^5c202373]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

6 CUTANEOUS PRURITUS: ITCH WITH NO PRIMARY PRURITIC DERMATOSIS

Itch typically arises from inflamed skin, which may be the result of allergic inflammation or infectious skin (e.g. fungal, parasitic, and viral infections). On the other hand, a certain population of patients with itch present with uninflamed or normal‐appearing skin. These skin conditions may or may not result in secondary skin changes due to scratching. This itch condition is coined “cutaneous pruritus” in the Japanese Dermatological Association's guideline,“pruritus with no underlying dermatosis,” or “generalized pruritus without rash” if itch is generalized, in the British Association of Dermatologists' guidelines for the investigation and management of generalized pruritus in adults without an underlying dermatosis, 2018,and “pruritus on non‐diseased skin” in a position paper of the International Forum for the Study of Itch.The Japanese guideline further categorizes cutaneous pruritus into two phenotypes: generalized cutaneous pruritus and localized cutaneous pruritus. Generalized pruritus refers to presence of itch on a wide area of the body, while localized pruritus is defined as itch fixed and localized to a specific part of the body.

Hereinafter, the term cutaneous pruritus is used to describe itch without primary pruritic dermatosis and observable primary rash.

### The effects of treatment on itch in atopic dermatitis [^048303cc]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Pruritus causes significant impairment in the quality of life of patients suffering from atopic dermatitis. Treatments for itch in atopic dermatitis range from simple avoidance of pruritus triggers to more complicated systemic therapy. Several treatments aim to target specific mediators of itch in atopic dermatitis, whereas others improve pruritus by reducing inflammation. Currently the most effective treatments for atopic dermatitis-associated itch are primarily topical or systemic anti-inflammatory agents. Better management of pruritus in atopic dermatitis is an important goal and necessitates the development of novel targeted treatments as well as efficient use of current therapies.

### Scratching the surface: a comprehensive guide to understanding and managing vulvovaginal itching [^3168209a]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Vulvovaginal itching is a common yet often under-recognized condition affecting women across all age groups. Despite its prevalence, many dermatologists receive minimal training in vulvar diseases, leading to delayed diagnoses and prolonged discomfort for patients. This review explores the broad spectrum of causes, including infections, inflammatory conditions, neuropathic disorders, and systemic illnesses. The complexity of vulvovaginal pruritus often requires a multidisciplinary approach to accurately diagnose and treat. Contributing factors such as hormonal changes, personal hygiene practices, and environmental exposures must also be considered. Treatment strategies typically begin with lifestyle modifications and topical therapies, such as corticosteroids and antifungals, but can extend to systemic medications and biologics for resistant cases. Additionally, nonpharmaceutical options such as sitz baths and psychological interventions can be crucial for managing chronic symptoms. However, there remains a significant gap in research, particularly regarding the characterization of female-specific pruritus and its long-term impact on quality of life. Despite some advances, the available studies largely focus on isolated causes rather than the holistic nature of the condition. Further research is urgently needed to develop comprehensive, evidence-based guidelines for diagnosing and treating vulvovaginal itching, a condition that has a profound effect on both physical and emotional well-being.

### Diagnosis and management of neuropathic itch [^a9a23a97]. Dermatologic Clinics (2018). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pruritus is a challenging condition that can be caused by injury or dysfunction in any part of the nervous system. A vast array of clinical pictures exist, including both localized and generalized pruritus, and their principal entities are described in this article. Diagnosis is often difficult and depends on patient history, imaging, and neurophysiologic studies. Other causes of chronic itch should be excluded. The management of neuropathic itch is demanding and the majority of interventions are not curative. The best treatment options include anticonvulsants, topical anesthetics, and capsaicin.

### Advanced aging skin and itch: addressing an unmet need [^32892d9b]. Dermatologic Therapy (2013). Low credibility.

Itch is the most common skin disorder in the elderly and frequently diminishes quality of life in this population. The high prevalence of pruritus in elderly patients is attributed in part to the decline in the normal physiology of the advanced aging skin, and reflects poor hydration, impaired skin barrier, and altered neural function, all ultimately contributing to inflammation and pruritus. As the elderly population continues to grow, practitioners need to be aware of how to evaluate and manage pruritus, recognizing the common conditions contributing to itch in elderly patients as well as the challenges of treatment in this group. Ultimately, management of pruritus will require an individually tailored approach that is guided by a patient's general health, severity of symptoms, and the potential adverse effects of itch therapies.

### Neuropathic agents in the management of pruritus in burn injuries: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^256c5145]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Registration

This review was registered on the PROSPERO Register of Systematic Reviews, ID number CRD42020164777. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for the conduct of systematic reviews were followed throughout.

Eligibility criteria

Articles were included that investigated the management of pruritus in patients of any age that had sustained a burn injury with the use of neuropathic agents that are listed in the NICE guideline (CG173) “neuropathic pain in adults: pharmacological management in non-specialist settings”.Given the likelihood of several studies being observational in nature, no restrictions were made regarding the use of a control group. Animal studies, human volunteer studies, literature reviews, and conference abstracts were excluded, otherwise no restrictions on the type of study were made.

Search strategy

Three databases, MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), were searched with no time period or language restrictions (last accessed January 7, 2021). The search strategies for each database can be found in the online supplemental material.

Study selection

After amalgamation of search results from the three sources and removal of duplicates, two authors (CM, WN) independently conducted a title review, abstract review, and then full article review to select articles for inclusion. Any disagreement between the two reviewers was resolved by a third reviewer (LP). The references of all titles included in the data analysis were screened for further articles to be included.

Data extraction

Data were extracted by CM using a predefined spreadsheet which included study design, patient demographics, interventions, and outcomes. In the event of missing data, study investigators were contacted.

Outcomes measured

The outcome of interest was the severity of pruritus at any time point. No specific restrictions were used, with all quantitative severity scales, qualitative measures, and questionnaire methods of assessment included. For inclusion in meta-analysis, any quantitative scales were converted to an 11-point continuous scale and the mean difference between groups reported.

Risk of bias assessment

Each included study was assessed independently by CM and WN using a specific risk of bias tool. The RoB2 (the updated Cochrane risk of bias tool) was used for randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and ROBINS-I tool for non-randomized studies. The quality of evidence for the outcomes of interest were assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) system.

### Neuropathic pruritus [^be75b543]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Pruritus, also known as itch, is a very common, unpleasant sensation that elicits an urge to scratch. Its origin is not always in the skin, and neuropathic itch that is caused by neuronal or glial damage is common, but poorly understood by both dermatologists and neurologists. Although pruritus has not been considered as serious a symptom as pain, it is difficult to treat and--if chronic--can severely impair quality of life. Neuropathic itch is often associated with other clinical symptoms, most commonly neuropathic pain, and hypersensitization to stimuli is present in both pruritus and pain of neuropathic origin. The shared aetiology can aid in finding suitable treatment for itch in some cases, but more detailed knowledge of the mechanisms of itch, along with standardized, well-controlled trials, is needed. Pruritus research is an emerging but currently very active field, and our understanding of this sensation is rapidly increasing. Here, we review new discoveries regarding the role of the nervous system and the contribution of different pathways in pruritus, discuss the different aetiologies of neuropathic itch, and outline currently available and potential strategies for managing neuropathic pruritus.

### Sensitive skin syndrome: an Update [^a8c4c8b6]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Sensitive skin syndrome is a widely reported complaint but a diagnostic challenge because of its subjective symptoms and lack of clearly visible manifestations. Epidemiological studies have shown the prevalence of sensitive skin to be as high as 60-70% among women and 50-60% among men. Patients with this syndrome usually have unpleasant sensations when exposed to physical, thermal, or chemical stimuli that normally cause no provocation on healthy skin. Recent studies and newly accepted position papers have provided a more in-depth understanding and consensus of its underlying pathophysiology, associations, diagnosis, and treatment. Since no clinical studies have been conducted about specific treatment protocols, patients with this condition should be provided with personalized skin management. Given this updated knowledge, our review offers an approach to sensitive skin syndrome, with differential diagnoses, and interventions targeting its pathophysiology.

5 TREATMENT APPROACHES FOR ITCH

A variety of treatment approaches are currently in use in clinical practice, either as approved treatments or as off‐label uses (Figure 1).

5.1 Treatment approaches for pruritic dermatosis

When primary pruritic dermatosis is evident in patients presenting with itch, the initial step to reduce itch is to treat the dermatosis. In cases where dry skin is evident, the use of topical emollients or moisturizers can effectively alleviate the itching sensation.Additionally, treatment approaches for pruritic dermatoses encompass a range of options, including topical/systemic anti‐inflammatory agents (e.g. corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants), biologics, Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, and phototherapy.,,

5.2 Treatment approaches acting on the skin and peripheral sensory nerves

In addition to their anti‐inflammatory effects, biologics and JAK inhibitors possess direct antipruritic properties. Peripheral sensory nerve fibers express receptors for type 2 cytokines, particularly IL‐4, IL‐13, and IL‐31.Upon activation of these cytokine receptors, JAK1 and STAT3 in peripheral sensory nerve fibers undergo phosphorylation, leading to the opening of ion channels (TRPA1, TRPV1, and Na v 1.7) and the generation of action potentials. Therefore, biologics that target type 2 cytokine signaling pathways (e.g. nemolizumab, dupilumab, tralokinumab, and lebrikizumab) and small molecules that inhibit JAK1 phosphorylation (e.g. delgocitinib, ruxolitinib, abrocitinib, and baricitinib) are capable of inhibiting the generation of action potentials, resulting in the alleviation of itch (Figures 2 and 4).

FIGURE 4 
Mechanisms of action of targeted approaches for cutaneous pruritus in sensory nerve fibers. Biologics target cytokines or cytokine receptor components. Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitors regulate the generation of action potentials in nerve fibers. Analgesics/anesthesia and antidepressants act on voltage‐gated sodium channels (Na v). IL, interleukin; OSMR, oncostatin M receptor; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription; TRP, transient receptor potential.

Phototherapy also possesses antipruritic properties besides anti‐inflammatory effects. Its mechanism of action involves the modulation of intraepidermal nerve fibers and epidermal opioid systems (i.e. MOR/KOR expression‐balance).

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease 1, 2 characterized by intense itch and recurrent eczematous skin lesions and associated with sleep disturbance, anxiety, depression and work absenteeism. 1, 2

Depending on severity, treatment guidelines recommend topical corticosteroids (TCS) as first‐line pharmacological intervention combined with general skin care and trigger avoidance. 3 However, topical anti‐inflammatory treatment is often insufficient to achieve disease control in patients with moderate‐to‐severe AD, 4 and systemic therapy is needed. 5

Interleukin (IL)‐13 is a key driver of underlying inflammation in AD, leading to skin barrier dysfunction, immune dysregulation and, ultimately, chronic type 2 inflammation. 6, 7 IL‐13 is overexpressed in lesional and nonlesional AD skin, 8, 9 with expression increasing with progression from the acute to the chronic disease stage. 10 Furthermore, increased expression of IL‐13 in the skin correlates with AD severity. 9, 11

8 DIAGNOSTIC PROCEDURES FOR CUTANEOUS PRURITUS

The diagnostic procedures for cutaneous pruritus are shown in Figure 9. The initial step is to ascertain that the presence of primary rash is apparent on the skin. In the absence of pruritic rash, a diagnosis of cutaneous pruritus can be made. In cases where a primary pruritic dermatosis is evident but the appropriate treatment for it does not alleviate the itch, then the possibility of a coexistence of a pruritic dermatosis with cutaneous pruritus should be considered.

FIGURE 9

In the absence of pruritic rash, a diagnosis of cutaneous pruritus can be made, and further examination determines which type of cutaneous pruritus the patient has. CKD‐aP, chronic kidney disease–associated pruritus.

Localized itch is favorably indicative of a neuropathic origin, whereas generalized itch is suggestive of alternative forms of cutaneous pruritus, including cutaneous pruritus with underlying systemic disease(s), drug‐induced itch, psychogenic itch (functional itch disorder), and CPUO. A comprehensive examination for underlying systemic disease(s) is essential for accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

### Pruritus associated with targeted anticancer therapies and their management [^89ec65f9]. Dermatologic Clinics (2018). Low credibility.

Targeted anticancer therapies have significantly increased the survival of patients with a variety of malignancies, improving tolerability and treatment duration. The increased lifespan and the expanded use of targeted agents have led to a variety of treatment-related adverse events. Pruritus, a common dermatologic adverse event with various incidences ranging from 2.2% to 47% across different categories of targeted anticancer therapies, has been overlooked. This article reviews the incidence, accompanying skin conditions, possible pathomechanism, and proposed management algorithms of pruritus associated with targeted therapies, including immunotherapies.

### From compression to itch: exploring the link between nerve compression and neuropathic pruritus [^20622788]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatments for Neuropathic Itch

Treatment of neuropathic itch as a direct result of nerve impingement can often require modalities with different mechanisms of action than those traditionally used in pruritus caused by inflammatory skin disease. Typically, mild and/or localized itch can be managed by utilizing topical medication. Moderate to severe itch and/or itch that is more generalized can be treated with a more systemic approach through oral medication. Treatment of neuropathic itch tends to involve medications that either specifically alter the nerve function or reduce the perception of itch from nerve receptors. As such, these treatments often overlap with those for neuropathic pain due to similar underlying mechanisms. It is important to note that, as of August 2024, there are no current Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment options for neuropathic itch, and most therapeutic options are based on expert recommendations, off-label usage, and theoretical evidence.

### 2020 guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of cutaneous pruritus [^03a5da22]. The Journal of Dermatology (2021). Medium credibility.

The mechanisms underlying itch are not fully understood. Physicians usually encounter difficulty controlling itch in generalized pruritus. Since only a small percentage of patients with generalized pruritus respond to antihistamines (H 1 receptor antagonists), a variety of itch mediators and mechanisms other than histaminergic signals are considered to be involved in itch for these non-responsive patients. In 2012, we created guidelines for generalized pruritus. Those guidelines have been updated and revised to make some of the definitions, diagnostic terms, and classifications more applicable to daily clinical practice. Cutaneous pruritus as designated in these guidelines is a disease characterized by itch without an observable rash. Generalized pruritus (without skin inflammation) is defined as the presence of itch over a wide area, and not localized to a specific part of the body. This entity includes idiopathic pruritus, pruritus in the elderly, symptomatic pruritus, pregnancy-associated pruritus, drug-induced pruritus, and psychogenic pruritus. Localized pruritus (without skin inflammation) represents fixed itch localized to a specific part of the body, and includes anogenital pruritus, scalp pruritus, notalgia paresthetica, and brachioradial pruritus. These guidelines outline the current concepts and specify the diagnostic methods/treatments for cutaneous pruritus.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of atopic dermatitis 2016 [^8726aeb4]. The Journal of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a disease characterized by relapsing eczema with pruritus as a primary lesion. Most patients have an atopic predisposition. The definitive diagnosis of AD requires the presence of all three features: (i) pruritus; (ii) typical morphology and distribution of the eczema; and (iii) chronic and chronically relapsing course. The current strategies to treat AD in Japan from the perspective of evidence-based medicine consist of three primary measures: (i) the use of topical corticosteroids and tacrolimus ointment as the main treatment for the inflammation; (ii) topical application of emollients to treat the cutaneous barrier dysfunction; and (iii) avoidance of apparent exacerbating factors, psychological counseling and advice about daily life. The guidelines present recommendations to review clinical research articles, evaluate the balance between the advantages and disadvantages of medical activities, and optimize medical activity-related patient outcomes with respect to several important points requiring decision-making in clinical practice.

### Burns pruritus – a study of current practices in the UK [^9a527941]. Burns (2010). Low credibility.

Pruritus is a universal symptom associated with burns healing. Little research has been conducted to assess physicians' attitudes and management principles in specialist units. A survey of UK burn units has identified a variety of opinions on the importance of various factors affecting the incidence of pruritus and a lack of a systematic approach in the assessment and treatment of this distressing symptom. A clear pattern emerged favouring the use of antihistaminergic agents for burns pruritus management with a low uptake of agents acting on the central nervous system as well as non-pharmacological adjuncts. The cumulative responses from the cohort of respondents are presented and issues pertinent to further research and clinical management are discussed.

### Adjunctive management of itch in atopic dermatitis [^f5167e40]. Dermatologic Clinics (2017). Low credibility.

Itch, or pruritus, is a hallmark feature of atopic dermatitis (AD). The impact of AD-related pruritus can range from mildly distressing or distracting to completely disabling. Traditionally, management of itch in AD patients has focused on restoring the altered skin barrier with topical emollients and/or reducing inflammation. A growing emphasis has been placed on directly targeting the neural transmission pathways that mediate itch signaling. Off-label use of neuromodulatory agents has helped reduce this aggravating symptom in atopic patients. This article reviews the current literature on the use of neuromodulatory agents and nonpharmacologic alternative therapies used to treat AD-related pruritus.

### Consensus guidelines for the management of atopic dermatitis: an Asia-Pacific perspective [^dfdbb673]. The Journal of Dermatology (2013). Low credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a relatively common disease in patients in the Asia-Pacific region. It presents a particular clinical challenge and requires careful clinical management. The chronic nature of AD characterized by flares, exacerbations and periods of quiescence requires a multipronged approach aimed at reducing itch, inflammation and the appearance of secondary lesions. In addition, varying levels of maintenance therapy may be required to avoid exacerbations. Survey data from the region indicate that there is significant variation across the Asia-Pacific with regard to current treatment practices. The management of AD may also be influenced by differing health-care systems, variable climate, access to medical care and cultural diversity. The current consensus guidelines have been developed to provide up-to-date and concise evidence- and experience-based recommendations directed towards general practitioners and general dermatologists in the Asia-Pacific region on the management of pediatric and adult AD.

### Management of chronic hepatic itch [^cc323392]. Dermatologic Clinics (2018). Low credibility.

Hepatic itch remains among the most agonizing symptoms for affected patients and a major clinical challenge for physicians. Pruritus may occur in almost all liver diseases, particularly those with cholestatic features. Hepatic itch arises irrespective of the severity of the underlying liver disease or extent of cholestasis. Antihistamines are ineffective in hepatic itch. Therapeutic recommendations consist of a guideline-based stepwise approach, starting with the anion exchange resin cholestyramine, followed by rifampicin, naltrexone, and sertraline. Bezafibrate and ileal bile acid transporter inhibitors are promising future treatment options. Experimental and invasive procedures should be reserved for refractory pruritus.

### Guidelines of care for the management of atopic dermatitis: section 1. diagnosis and assessment of atopic dermatitis [^077ffc80]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (AD) gaps in research—the expert group’s priorities emphasize that while much is known about diagnosis and evaluation, much has yet to be learned. Significant gaps in research were identified, including but not limited to: validation studies of the AAD workgroup diagnostic criteria, development, validation, and uniformity in use of disease severity and quality of life measurements applicable to a busy clinical practice environment, interventional studies testing impact of multidisciplinary management on AD outcomes, and additional quality, controlled studies on epidemiologic risk factors for disease. It is hoped that additional knowledge of AD pathogenesis will soon lead to a proven biomarker for diagnosis and/or monitoring, and that AD-associated pruritus is better understood to generate improved therapeutic options.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the prevention and treatment of EGFR inhibitor-associated dermatologic toxicities [^af19bb36]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Medium credibility.

EGFRI-induced pruritus—epidemiology, mechanisms, and evidence base are summarized as follows. “Pruritus occurs in approximately half of all EGFRI-treated patients,” and although it “rarely requires dose modifications or discontinuation of drug therapy,” it “can have dramatic impact upon the patient’s HQOL.” “Because itching can also occur as a consequence of dry skin, it is important to ensure adequate measures are provided to prevent dryness (see the “Xerosis and fissures” section).” “Currently, the mechanism of action behind pruritus induced by EGFRIs is not clearly elucidated.” Mechanistic context notes that “Histamine, which is released by mast cells in persons with urticaria, is classically associated with pruritus” and “It is unknown whether other neurotransmitters or receptors (including serotonin, opioids, and gamma-aminobutyric acid) explain the pruritus that is experienced by patients treated with EGFRIs.” Regarding evidence, “In the literature, no clinical studies are designed to study specific primary endpoints to evaluate the most optimal therapy for EGFRI-induced pruritus,” so “much of the data originated from case series as well as case reports,” and “Table 6 displays the recommendations for the treatment of pruritus.”
