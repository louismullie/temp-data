## Question

Medication which caused gout

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medications can cause gout. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology linking medications to gout via hyperuricemia. Then, I should identify the medication classes with the strongest evidence for causation. Next, I will verify specific agents within those classes and their mechanisms. After that, I should consider additional or conditional contributors and reconcile any conflicting guidance. Finally, I will synthesize a prioritized list and outline practical clinical implications for management, making sure each claim is supported by guidelines or high-quality reviews.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic frame: gout results from monosodium urate crystal deposition in the setting of hyperuricemia, so medications that raise serum urate can precipitate gout flares. Mechanistically, that happens via increased uric acid production, decreased renal excretion, or both, with impaired excretion being more common in drug-induced cases [^903698b8] [^5b2dd157].

> Now, I should identify the medication classes with the clearest causal signal. Diuretics consistently emerge as the most important culprits, particularly thiazides and loop diuretics, which reduce uric acid excretion and are repeatedly flagged in guidelines and reviews as major secondary causes of hyperuricemia and gout; calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine, tacrolimus) also have a strong association and are explicitly recommended to be discontinued when nonessential in patients with gout [^90daf34c] [^5b2dd157] [^28572b90].

> Wait, let me verify the mechanism for diuretics before moving on. Thiazide and loop diuretics promote volume contraction and increase proximal tubular reabsorption of uric acid, thereby raising serum urate; this effect is well described and clinically meaningful, and explains why switching away from thiazides is conditionally recommended in gout when feasible [^5b2dd157] [^29230ad4].

> Next, I should review low-dose aspirin, because I recall conflicting guidance. Initially, I thought stopping low-dose aspirin might be broadly recommended to lower urate, but hold on, I should double-check the most recent ACR guidance. The 2020 ACR guideline advises against stopping low-dose aspirin solely for gout management when it is indicated for cardiovascular reasons, even though low-dose aspirin can modestly raise serum urate; thus, I need to correct my earlier inclination and state that cessation is not advised when aspirin is clinically indicated [^29230ad4] [^14d6a596].

> I will now examine additional contributors. Niacin (nicotinic acid) can increase uric acid levels and is listed among medications to discontinue when nonessential in gout, and pyrazinamide for TB is a recognized cause of hyperuricemia. Pyrazinamide is not detailed in the provided ACR excerpts, so I should be cautious and note it as a known offender from broader literature while keeping the citation scope tight here [^90daf34c] [^5b2dd157].

> Let me consider urate-lowering therapy itself, because I need to ensure I don't misattribute causation. Initiating or uptitrating allopurinol or febuxostat can transiently precipitate flares due to mobilization of urate crystals, but this is a treatment effect rather than a medication-induced hyperuricemia; guidelines therefore recommend concomitant anti-inflammatory prophylaxis for 3–6 months when starting ULT to mitigate this predictable risk [^647133e7] [^6239eda6].

> But wait, what if other antihypertensives or lipid-lowering agents are involved. Losartan has mild uricosuric properties and is sometimes favored in gout with hypertension, though it should not be used as primary urate-lowering therapy; conversely, fenofibrate has a weak uricosuric effect and is not recommended to be added solely for gout, so I should clarify that these are adjunctive considerations rather than causal medications [^29230ad4] [^b535ac9e].

> I should double-check that I've captured the highest-yield agents. Synthesizing across guidelines and reviews, the medications with the most consistent and clinically important causal association with gout are thiazide diuretics, loop diuretics, and calcineurin inhibitors, with low-dose aspirin and niacin as additional contributors when nonessential; pyrazinamide is a recognized cause but is outside the provided guideline excerpts, so I will flag it as a known offender without overextending citations here [^90daf34c] [^5b2dd157] [^28572b90].

> Next, I should review practical clinical implications. For patients with gout, I need to check for diuretic use and, when feasible, switch thiazides to alternatives; evaluate the necessity of calcineurin inhibitors and consider discontinuation if nonessential; avoid stopping indicated low-dose aspirin; and when starting urate-lowering therapy, implement colchicine or NSAID prophylaxis to prevent mobilization flares, aligning with treat-to-target urate goals and comorbidity-driven safety choices [^29230ad4] [^647133e7] [^6239eda6].

> In summary, I need to ensure the hierarchy is clear: primary medication causes of gout via hyperuricemia are thiazide and loop diuretics and calcineurin inhibitors, with low-dose aspirin and niacin as additional contributors when nonessential; urate-lowering therapy can trigger flares but does not cause chronic hyperuricemia, and management should prioritize modifying offending drugs when possible while protecting indicated cardiovascular therapies and using flare prophylaxis during ULT initiation [^90daf34c] [^5b2dd157] [^29230ad4] [^647133e7].

Medications that cause gout are those that raise serum uric acid by **reducing excretion** or **increasing production** of uric acid. The most common are **thiazide and loop diuretics**, which impair renal urate clearance and are strongly linked to gout flares [^5b2dd157] [^90daf34c]. Low-dose aspirin, cyclosporine, and tacrolimus also increase uric acid and can precipitate gout [^28572b90] [^3e640d09]. Niacin and pyrazinamide are additional offenders, and initiation or uptitration of urate-lowering therapy (allopurinol, febuxostat) can transiently trigger flares during early treatment [^647133e7] [^6239eda6]. Management includes identifying and adjusting these drugs when feasible, using anti-inflammatory prophylaxis when starting ULT, and choosing alternatives such as losartan when appropriate [^29230ad4] [^6239eda6].

## Medications that increase uric acid levels and cause gout

Several medication classes are well documented to raise serum uric acid and precipitate gout flares via **reduced excretion** or **increased production** of uric acid [^5b2dd157].

| **Medication class** | **Examples** | **Mechanism of action** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Diuretics | - Thiazides (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide) <br/> - Loop diuretics (e.g. furosemide) | Reduced renal excretion of uric acid via competition for transporters and volume depletion | Strongly associated with gout; ACR recommends switching when feasible [^29230ad4] [^50ee0622] |
| Antiplatelet agents | Low-dose aspirin (≤ 325 mg/day) | Reduced renal excretion of uric acid | Associated with increased gout risk; avoid stopping if indicated for CV protection [^29230ad4] [^14d6a596] |
| Immunosuppressants | - Cyclosporine <br/> - Tacrolimus | Reduced renal excretion and increased uric acid production | Well-documented cause of gout; monitor uric acid closely [^28572b90] [^3e640d09] |
| Antihypertensive agents | Niacin (nicotinic acid) | Increased uric acid production | Associated with hyperuricemia; use cautiously in gout patients [^90daf34c] |
| Antitubercular agents | Pyrazinamide | Reduced renal excretion of uric acid | Known to cause hyperuricemia and gout flares |
| Urate-lowering therapy | - Allopurinol <br/> - Febuxostat | Mobilization of urate crystals during initiation or dose escalation | Transient flares common; provide anti-inflammatory prophylaxis [^647133e7] [^6239eda6] |

---

## Clinical implications and management strategies

Recognizing medication-induced gout is essential for **effective management**:

- **Identify and adjust offending medications**: When feasible, switch thiazide diuretics to alternatives (e.g. losartan) and avoid or adjust other causative drugs based on clinical context [^29230ad4] [^50ee0622].
- **Monitor serum uric acid**: Regular monitoring helps detect drug-induced hyperuricemia early and guide therapy adjustments [^6239eda6].
- **Use anti-inflammatory prophylaxis**: When initiating or uptitrating urate-lowering therapy, use colchicine or NSAIDs for 3–6 months to prevent flares [^647133e7] [^6239eda6].
- **Patient education**: Educate patients about medication triggers and adherence to urate-lowering therapy and lifestyle modifications [^6577200c].

---

## Conclusion

Medications that cause gout include **diuretics**, **low-dose aspirin**, **cyclosporine**, **tacrolimus**, **niacin**, **pyrazinamide**, and **urate-lowering agents** during initiation. Identifying and adjusting these medications, along with appropriate prophylaxis and monitoring, are key to preventing and managing drug-induced gout.

### What is allopurinol failure and what should we Do about It? [^126e1560]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Allopurinol is the most widely used urate-lowering medication worldwide. However, allopurinol failure is frequently observed in clinical practice. In this review, we provide a framework for assessing allopurinol failure, which includes failure of allopurinol to control serum urate concentrations, failure of allopurinol to control clinical symptoms, and failure of allopurinol due to an adverse drug reaction. Understanding the causes of allopurinol failure underpins the approach required to turn failure into success in gout management.

### The genetics of gout: towards personalised medicine? [^ab3ab110]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Future directions and conclusions

Rapidly progressive technology and disease-specific genetic discoveries have the potential to make personalised medicine a reality in many aspects of gout management, including risk assessment of disease progression, personalised lifestyle advice, selection and dosing of ULT, and prevention of serious medication adverse effects. Although major progress has been made through GWAS, there is a further need for large, well-characterised datasets that include different disease states, detailed pharmacology (including dose information, treatment response, adverse drug reactions) and lifestyle information. A further challenge is population-specific effects, meaning that discoveries in one population may not be translatable to other populations. In order to avoid increasing the disparities that are already evident in gout management, study of different populations will be essential, particularly of those with high prevalence of severe disease.

### Gout [^0ae802d2]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2015). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout affects about 5% of men and 1% of women, with up to 80% of people experiencing a recurrent attack within 3 years.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of treatments for acute gout? What are the effects of xanthine oxidase inhibitors to prevent gout in people with prior acute episodes? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to September 2013 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 21 studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: colchicine, corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and xanthine oxidase inhibitors.

### Recent pharmacological advances in the management of gout [^cd8c930c]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Gout is the most common cause of inflammatory arthritis worldwide, and reports show that despite availability of therapies, management is still suboptimal. The new EULAR 2016 recommendations for the treatment of gout highlight the huge development in gout therapies, and the number of drugs being trialled only continues to increase. A clinical review of the evidence that underlies the recommendations from EULAR can reveal possible gaps in the literature and avenues for future research into gout therapies.

### Safety of urate-lowering therapies: managing the risks to gain the benefits [^fc6a2400]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Gout is a metabolic disorder of purine metabolism and uric acid elimination. Over time, acute gout can develop into a chronic, disabling arthropathy, often associated with multiple comorbidities. Gout patients have often been undertreated, partly because of the clinician's perceived risks of a therapy outweighing its potential benefits. The approval of new therapies to treat hyperuricemia in gout has led to a new understanding of gout management and medication safety regarding new and old therapies. This review focuses on potential safety issues of currently available urate-lowering therapies and outlines strategies to minimize risks so their benefits can be reached.

### Diagnosis and treatment of gout [^81beacc6]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Gout is an ancient disease that has caused pain and suffering over many centuries. The tragedy is that today we have excellent medication for the prevention of chronic gout, yet many people continue to be plagued by gout attacks and develop chronic arthritis. The incidence of gout is increasing worldwide. This is related to ageing and lifestyle changes. Gout is increased in people with the metabolic syndrome, obesity, use of diuretics and intake of beer and sugared drinks.

This video and associated Powerpoint presentations should help anyone who manages patients with gout to understand how to elicit a good history, examine them and generate a differential diagnosis; the emphasis is to understand the causes of gout and take a proactive role (see online supplementary video and file). The good news is that gout can improve with lifestyle changes, and medication is relatively inexpensive.

### We can make gout management more successful now [^356223da]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this editorial review is to identify and comment on factors contributing to the current less-than-optimal state of gout management and to emphasize immediate opportunities to improve management practices affecting many patients with gout.

Recent Findings

Numerous publications document deficits in the current management and clinical outcomes of gout despite detailed understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of the disorder, the ability to establish the diagnosis with certainty, and the likely effectiveness, for most patients, of available lifestyle and pharmacological interventions. Among impediments to successful gout management are diagnostic inaccuracy; a paucity of validated management recommendations to guide care providers; incomplete patient education about gout and the aims and modalities of management; suboptimal patient adherence, even to demonstrably effective therapeutic recommendations; comorbidities and drug interferences that complicate treatment of gout; patient groups at special risk for progression to chronic tophaceous gout; and limited urate-lowering alternatives.

Summary

Recent publication of evidence-based recommendations for the diagnosis and management of gout and the impending availability of new urate-lowering agents suggest that this is an opportune time to initiate professional and patient education efforts toward improved management of this increasingly common disorder.

### Gout: thoughts about a Treat-to-target programme [^dc5b2130]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Gout is a rheumatic disease resulting from deposition of uric acid crystals in tissues and fluids within the body. The pathogenesis involves underexcretion or overproduction of uric acid, a biproduct of metabolism of purines, resulting in a metabolic disorder commonly known as hyperuricaemia, has a relatively high prevalence in the population (0.5–1%, similar to rheumatoid arthritis). Patients with hyperuricaemia are at risk to develop acute gouty attacks which may be severely painful. The attacks tend to occur episodically over a few days up to a week or two, but gout may later become chronic. Different aims of therapy and management are well suited as targets of treatment, including reduction of purine intake, increased of excretion of uric acid, mobilisation of urate pools within the body, and reduction of acute and chronic inflammation through anti-inflammatory medications.

### Why better treatment of gout is needed [^b56854e7]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2016). Low credibility.

The treatment of gout is thought to be simple, but in reality we are confronted regularly with patients who do not adhere to treatment and patients who have other medical conditions that render the choice of therapy difficult. A treat-to-target approach is essential in order to manage hyperuricaemia effectively and this, combined with a better use of existing treatments, offers the best way forward.

### The challenges of approaching and managing gout [^f8aef601]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite many effective treatments for gout, its management remains a challenge internationally. Options for optimizing gout management may differ in different practice sizes and settings. Gout incidence is rising and it continues to be associated with increased mortality. Education of patients and medical providers is essential, and newer gout medications need to be used in the most appropriate ways for cost-effective therapy. Special consideration needs to be given to such populations as the elderly and those with renal and cardiovascular disease in gout management. New agents are in development, which may add to the armamentarium for gout management.

### Drug-induced hyperuricaemia and gout [^5b2dd157]. Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Hyperuricaemia is a common clinical condition that can be defined as a serum uric acid level > 6.8 mg/dl (404 µmol/l). Gout, a recognized complication of hyperuricaemia, is the most common inflammatory arthritis in adults. Drug-induced hyperuricaemia and gout present an emergent and increasingly prevalent problem in clinical practice. Diuretics are one of the most important causes of secondary hyperuricaemia. Drugs raise serum uric acid level by an increase of uric acid reabsorption and/or decrease in uric acid secretion. Several drugs may also increase uric acid production. In this review, drugs leading to hyperuricaemia are summarized with regard to their mechanism of action and clinical significance. Increased awareness of drugs that can induce hyperuricaemia and gout, and monitoring and prevention are key elements for reducing the morbidity related to drug-induced hyperuricaemia and gout.

### Optimizing current treatment of gout [^6577200c]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2014). Medium credibility.

Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis worldwide. Although effective treatments exist to eliminate sodium urate crystals and to 'cure' the disease, the management of gout is often suboptimal. This article reviews available treatments, recommended best practice and barriers to effective care, and how these barriers might be overcome. To optimize the management of gout, health professionals need to know not only how to treat acute attacks but also how to up-titrate urate-lowering therapy against a specific target level of serum uric acid that is below the saturation point for crystal formation. Current perspectives are changing towards much earlier use of urate-lowering therapy, even at the time of first diagnosis of gout. Holistic assessment and patient education are essential to address patient-specific risk factors and ensuring adherence to individualized therapy. Shared decision-making between a fully informed patient and practitioner greatly increases the likelihood of curing gout.

### Gout and the COVID-19 pandemic [^46d68a42]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review gives an overview of recently published articles on COVID-19 and gout.

Recent Findings

People with gout are likely to be at an increased risk of poor outcomes after COVID-19 infection due to comorbid cardiometabolic conditions. The effects of chronic hyperuricemia on trained immunity, and the hyperinflammatory state induced by gout itself may also play a role. Frequent courses of glucocorticoids for gout flares may be associated with adverse outcomes after COVID-19 infection and reduced immunogenicity to the COVID-19 vaccination. Similarities between the pathophysiology of gout flares and the dysregulated inflammatory response of severe COVID-19 have been identified. Medications used in the treatment of gout, including colchicine and interleukin-1 inhibitors, have shown promise in the treatment of COVID-19 in clinical trials. Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a negative impact on gout care, with patients reporting more difficulty with disease control, accessing medications and healthcare, and poorer quality of life.

Summary

The COVID-19 pandemic has created many challenges for people with gout. At present, there is a lack of guidance on the management of gout during the pandemic and paucity of research assessing outcomes of COVID-19 infection in people with gout.

### Treatment guidelines in gout [^07985e5e]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

The range of drug treatment options to treat acute and chronic gout has changed dramatically over the last 20 years. Yet, there is general consensus that drug therapy selection, dosing and dose titration, of both traditional and novel agents is far from optimally delivered in clinical practice. Updated guidelines disseminated in the last 5 years, from the American College of Physicians, the European League Against Rheumatism, and the American College of Rheumatology, provide clear guidance to the medical community on how and when to optimally integrate these therapeutic options into practice to improve the medical management of gout.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^647133e7]. Arthritis Care & Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To provide guidance for the management of gout, including indications for and optimal use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), treatment of gout flares, and lifestyle and other medication recommendations.

Methods

Fifty-seven population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes questions were developed, followed by a systematic literature review, including network meta-analyses with ratings of the available evidence according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, and patient input. A group consensus process was used to compose the final recommendations and grade their strength as strong or conditional.

Results

Forty-two recommendations (including 16 strong recommendations) were generated. Strong recommendations included initiation of ULT for all patients with tophaceous gout, radiographic damage due to gout, or frequent gout flares; allopurinol as the preferred first-line ULT, including for those with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD; stage > 3); using a low starting dose of allopurinol (≤ 100 mg/day, and lower in CKD) or febuxostat (< 40 mg/day); and a treat-to-target management strategy with ULT dose titration guided by serial serum urate (SU) measurements, with an SU target of < 6 mg/dl. When initiating ULT, concomitant antiinflammatory prophylaxis therapy for a duration of at least 3–6 months was strongly recommended. For management of gout flares, colchicine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intraarticular, or intramuscular) were strongly recommended.

Conclusion

Using GRADE methodology and informed by a consensus process based on evidence from the current literature and patient preferences, this guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients making decisions on the management of gout.

### Up-to-date management of gout [^5a718f99]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Gout is a true crystal deposition disease, extremely painful and bone and tissue damaging if untreated. It is the only curable form of arthritis. Although we have many treatments to cure gout, it is a disease that is consistently undertreated/mismanaged and perceived by clinicians and the lay public as a 'laughable condition' with the patients' lifestyle often held erroneously to account. This article would give you a good understanding of modern and established pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments used in the management of acute and chronic gout and how to 'treat to target' to cure the disease.

Recent Findings

Many of the drugs we use to manage patients with gouty arthritis have been in existence since the 1970s and 1980s. In the past few years, because of the improved physiological understanding of gout, new innovative treatments such as anti-IL inhibitors, a nonxanthine oxidase inhibitor and the uricase enzymes have been developed adding to our armamentarium of drugs.

Summary

With the introduction of new research, we have been able to explore how to also use established treatments more effectively, raising the profile of gout and its best management and introducing the principle of treating the patient to urate target.

### Gout and NLRP3 inflammasome biology [^a1a71167]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Once gout flare has been effectively treated in the acute setting, long‐term gout management is also required. For people with frequent gout flares (two or more over 12 months), tophaceous gout, or joint damage related to gout, long‐term urate‐lowering therapy is strongly recommended to maintain a serum urate level below 6 mg/dL and dissolve deposited MSU crystals, which ultimately treats the underlying cause of gout flare and prevents ongoing NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In the first months of initiating urate‐lowering therapy, gout flares are common, and these flares can be prevented by low doses of oral colchicine or other anti‐inflammatory medications. Consistent with the central role of IL‐1β in the initiation of acute MSU crystal–induced inflammation, canakinumab significantly prevented recurrent gout flares over 24 weeks in a randomized controlled trial.

### New ACR guidelines for gout management hold some surprises [^8d64ce31]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Despite exciting progress in the understanding and treatment of gout, management of this condition remains suboptimal. In the face of this inadequacy, new guidelines provide recommendations both for therapeutic approaches to hyperuricaemia and for the management and anti-inflammatory prophylaxis of acute gouty arthritis.

### Key barriers to gout care: a systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies [^8ac60c15]. Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

Objectives

Gout care remains highly suboptimal, contributing to an increased global disease burden. To understand barriers to gout care, our aim was to provide a systematic review and thematic synthesis of qualitative studies worldwide reporting provider and patient perspectives and experiences with management.

Methods

We conducted a mapped search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Social Sciences Citation Index databases and selected qualitative studies of provider and patient perspectives on gout management. We used thematic synthesis to combine the included studies and identify key themes across studies.

Results

We included 20 studies that reported the experiences and perspectives of 480 gout patients and 120 providers spanning five different countries across three continents. We identified three predominant provider themes: knowledge gaps and management approaches; perceptions and beliefs about gout patients; and system barriers to optimal gout care (e.g. time constraints and a lack of incentives). We also identified four predominant themes among gout patients: limited gout knowledge; interactions with health-care providers; attitudes towards and experiences with taking medication; and practical barriers to long-term medication use.

Conclusion

Our systematic review of worldwide literature consistently identified gaps in gout knowledge among providers, which is likely to contribute to patients' lack of appropriate education about the fundamental causes of and essential treatment approaches for gout. Furthermore, system barriers among providers and day-to-day challenges of taking long-term medications among patients are considerable. These factors provide key targets to improve the widespread suboptimal gout care.

### Gout [^52c0da91]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

The treat to target strategy looks attractive for management of gout because it removes the causal mechanism inducing formation, growth, and aggregation of urate crystals. Further reduction of serum urate (sUA) levels below the threshold may dissolve crystals more rapidly. It is generally agreed that sUA less than 6 mg/dL is acceptable as a therapeutic and long-term preventive target, with < 5 mg/dL for the most severe cases. The challenges that this approach in gout is facing include whether proposed targets are the best for desired outcomes, whether they fit patient-related outcomes, and whether they adequately balance effectiveness and safety.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^fa894f3f]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

Introduction — gout epidemiology and care gaps are highlighted, noting that gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis, affecting ∼9.2 million adults (3.9%) in the US. The 2012 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Guidelines and other international specialty society guidelines recommend treat-to-target strategies with use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), yet over the past 2 decades there has been no increase in ULT utilization and adherence to ULT remains poor and is the lowest adherence among treatments for 7 common chronic medical conditions. Prior 2012 ACR Guidelines have been criticized due to low quality of evidence supporting treat-to-target recommendations, and several clinical trials since then provided additional evidence leading the ACR Guidelines Subcommittee to determine that new guidelines with updated recommendations were warranted.

### Long-term management of gout: nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies [^bfabe508]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Gout is a common disorder with clinical signs and symptoms resulting from inflammatory responses to monosodium urate crystals deposited in tissues from extracellular fluids saturated for urate. Long-term management of gout focuses on nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic means to achieve and maintain serum urate levels in a subsaturating range. Despite a firm understanding of gout pathophysiology, means to achieve certain diagnosis, and a variety of effective therapies, treatment outcomes remain suboptimal. In this review, available nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies for chronic gout are discussed and a framework is provided for successful achievement and maintenance of goal-range serum urate levels.

### Gout: will the "King of diseases" be the first rheumatic disease to be cured? [^c70240f5]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In summary, several new developments in gout, including the recognition of the role that innate immunity plays in crystal-induced inflammation in gout via activation of NALP3 inflammasome, the implementation of T2T sUA less than 6 mg/dL as an important goal relevant to patients, and new imaging techniques, classification criteria, and treatment guidelines, all provide a positive outlook for the treatment of the disease. The launch of new medications for treatment and a robust pipeline add to the new opportunities in optimizing gout treatment. The associated cardiovascular and renal comorbidities and the potential benefit of ULTs on these outcomes identify another important aspect of gout and its treatment. Gout, which has long been a disease of high interest for rheumatologists and clinical immunologists, should now be noticed by internists and family and general practitioners. I hope that the federal and other funding agencies become aware of the transformation of this old disease into an opportunity to learn about inflammation pathways and their impact on the associated comorbidities.

In recognition of the exciting developments in this field, BMC Medicine and BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders are launching an article collection focusing on the research that provides important developments in gout management and therapy. Authors interested in submitting to the collection are advised to visit the following link:

### Management of gout: a systematic review in support of an American College of Physicians clinical practice guideline [^5168a7c3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Gout is a common type of inflammatory arthritis in patients seen by primary care physicians.

Purpose

To review evidence about treatment of acute gout attacks, management of hyperuricemia to prevent attacks, and discontinuation of medications for chronic gout in adults.

Data Sources

Multiple electronic databases from January 2010 to March 2016, reference mining, and pharmaceutical manufacturers.

Study Selection

Studies of drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and commonly prescribed by primary care physicians, randomized trials for effectiveness, and trials and observational studies for adverse events.

Data Extraction

Data extraction was performed by one reviewer and checked by a second reviewer. Study quality was assessed by 2 independent reviewers. Strength-of-evidence assessment was done by group discussion.

Data Synthesis

High-strength evidence from 28 trials (only 3 of which were placebo-controlled) shows that colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and corticosteroids reduce pain in patients with acute gout. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that low-dose colchicine is as effective as high-dose colchicine and causes fewer gastrointestinal adverse events. Moderate-strength evidence suggests that urate-lowering therapy (allopurinol or febuxostat) reduces long-term risk for acute gout attacks after 1 year or more. High-strength evidence shows that prophylaxis with daily colchicine or NSAIDs reduces the risk for acute gout attacks by at least half in patients starting urate-lowering therapy, and moderate-strength evidence indicates that duration of prophylaxis should be longer than 8 weeks. Although lower urate levels reduce risk for recurrent acute attacks, treatment to a specific target level has not been tested.

Limitation

Few studies of acute gout treatments, no placebo-controlled trials of management of hyperuricemia lasting longer than 6 months, and few studies in primary care populations.

Conclusion

Colchicine, NSAIDs, and corticosteroids relieve pain in adults with acute gout. Urate-lowering therapy decreases serum urate levels and reduces risk for acute gout attacks.

### One year in review 2020: gout [^80d45831]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Gout is the most prevalent form of inflammatory arthritis, with a strong impact on individual health and healthcare systems. This article reviews clinical and experimental evidences about gout emerged throughout the 2019. Starting with an epidemiological analysis, the review explores new insights on genetic factors influencing the development of gout flare, pathogenetic mechanisms, risk factors for the disease and comorbidities. An overview on pharmacological therapies and recent knowledge on the impact of lifestyle and dietary habits are also included. Finally, the review contains a novel section on animal models, which reflects the renewed interest of researchers in the acute process triggered by monosodium urate crystals.

### Management of acute and recurrent gout: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^cbb6c3f8]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Description

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to present the evidence and provide clinical recommendations on the management of gout.

Methods

Using the ACP grading system, the committee based these recommendations on a systematic review of randomized, controlled trials; systematic reviews; and large observational studies published between January 2010 and March 2016. Clinical outcomes evaluated included pain, joint swelling and tenderness, activities of daily living, patient global assessment, recurrence, intermediate outcomes of serum urate levels, and harms.

Target Audience and Patient Population

The target audience for this guideline includes all clinicians, and the target patient population includes adults with acute or recurrent gout.

Recommendation 1

ACP recommends that clinicians choose corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or colchicine to treat patients with acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).

Recommendation 2

ACP recommends that clinicians use low-dose colchicine when using colchicine to treat acute gout. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 3

ACP recommends against initiating long-term urate-lowering therapy in most patients after a first gout attack or in patients with infrequent attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

Recommendation 4

ACP recommends that clinicians discuss benefits, harms, costs, and individual preferences with patients before initiating urate-lowering therapy, including concomitant prophylaxis, in patients with recurrent gout attacks. (Grade: strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### Treatment… [^6ccf8b51]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

Beer is associated with a larger increase in risk of gout compared with wine or hard liquor. 14 Use of loop or thiazide diuretic or tacrolimus is associated with increased risk of gout. 14 Consumption of two or more sugar-sweetened soft drinks per day, fruits high in fructose, or any fruit juices is associated with an increased risk of gout in men. Consumption of diet soft drinks does not appear to increase risk. PHARMACOLOGIC THERAPY: ACUTE EPISODE Colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroids relieve pain in adults with acute gout. 33 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are first-line treatment unless use is contraindicated.

8 Oral prednisolone is equal to naproxen in the treatment of acute gout, with no significant difference in pain relief or adverse effects.
34. In acute gout, low-dose colchicine was as effective as high-dose colchicine and had fewer adverse effects. Nearly 77% of patients treated with high-dose colchicine reported adverse effects compared with 36% in the low-dose colchicine group and 27% in the placebo group. 35 Further investigation is required to support routine use of interleukin-1 inhibitors. 36Interleukin-1 inhibitors may benefit select patients, including those with frequent gout flare-ups resistant to standard treatments or in whom current therapies are contraindicated.

40 Febuxostat is noninferior to allopurinol in preventing acute gout episodes. CORTICOSTEROID INJECTIONS There is no evidence from clinical trials to support the use of intra-articular corticosteroid injection in the treatment of acute gout. 46It could be considered in patients for whom nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or oral steroids are contraindicated.

### Environmental triggers of hyperuricemia and gout [^3e640d09]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Gout is the most prevalent type of inflammatory arthritis worldwide and environmental factors contribute to hyperuricemia and risk for gout flare. Causes of hyperuricemia include increased purine consumption from meat, alcohol, and high fructose corn syrup as well as medications such as cyclosporine, low-dose aspirin, or diuretics. Triggers for gout flares include increased purine consumption and medication use such as urate lowering therapy and diuretics. Environmental exposures including lead exposure, particulate matter exposure, temperature fluctuations, and physiologic stress have been found to trigger flares. In the right clinical scenario, these factors should be considered when treating gout patients.

### Perceptions about asymptomatic hyperuricemia and views about urate-lowering therapy in people with asymptomatic hyperuricemia [^bfe28eed]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background/Aims

Asymptomatic hyperuricemia is a precursor of gout and is also associated with cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease. The aim of this study was to understand perceptions about asymptomatic hyperuricemia and views about urate-lowering therapy in people with asymptomatic hyperuricemia.

Methods

Participants in a multi-national study of asymptomatic hyperuricemia completed questionnaires about their perceptions of hyperuricemia, concern about hyperuricemia-associated health conditions, and willingness to take urate-lowering medication. All had a screening serum urate of ≥ 0.48 mmol/L (8 mg/dL) and no current or previous symptoms of gout.

Results

Overall, participants perceived that hyperuricemia had no or very few consequences on their life. Dietary factors were the most reported cause, while 37% did not know the cause. Participants reported a wide range in concern about hyperuricemia and the risk of developing gout. Concern about the risk of developing kidney disease or cardiovascular disease was also highly variable but was higher than concern about elevated serum urate (P < 0.001). Most did not think a urate-lowering medication was necessary and there was moderate concern about the long-term use of urate-lowering medication. Medication necessity beliefs were most strongly associated with whether participants were willing to take urate-lowering medication (partial R² = 0.27, P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Most participants perceived minimal consequences of asymptomatic hyperuricemia. Hyperuricemia was not well understood by participants, and biological causes were generally under-recognised. Despite a range of concerns about hyperuricemia-associated conditions, particularly kidney disease and cardiovascular disease, a urate-lowering medication for asymptomatic hyperuricemia was not considered necessary, which aligns with most current management guidelines.

### Major unanswered questions in the clinical gout field [^0bedb0a7]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Although gout is one of the most common forms of inflammatory arthritis, it has been relatively neglected until recently. Despite progress in many areas of pathophysiology and genetics of gout and the development of new urate lowering therapies, there remain a number of unanswered clinical questions. With the resurgence of interest in gout it is important to recognize key aspects of gout management that remain challenging and require further research.

Recent Findings

The unanswered clinical issues outlined in this review are basic aspects of gout management that clinicians treating people with gout face on a daily basis and include when urate lowering therapy should be commenced, the most appropriate target serum urate, use of prophylaxis when starting urate lowering therapy and the most appropriate urate lowering therapy, particularly for those with chronic kidney disease.

Summary

Some of the issues outlined in this article are the subject of ongoing clinical research and some, such as use of allopurinol in people with chronic kidney impairment, may be less relevant with the advent of potentially safer urate lowering therapies but until that time further understanding to aid clinical decision-making is required.

### Gout in primary care [^5b28a9e0]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2004). Low credibility.

Gout affects around 1% of people in the UK, most aged over 45 years. The condition, which is five times more common in men than women, usually presents as a painful inflammatory monoarthritis, which can be diagnosed clinically and successfully treated with a high dose of an NSAID. Problems arise when the features are atypical or when high doses of an NSAID are inappropriate. Also; there is no robust evidence to guide when to start prophylactic therapy or what advice to give on lifestyle changes. Here we review current practice and offer advice on managing patients with this increasingly common condition, concentrating on approaches to be taken by the non-specialist.

### Determinants of self-management behavior in gout: a scoping review [^30344aa2]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Knowledge and skills for self‐management

Patients adhered to gout‐specific medication when they gained knowledge about the causes of gout, the consequences of having gout, the goals of ULT treatment, and knowing that flares can occur more frequently during the up‐titration of ULT. Likewise, not knowing or receiving a warning for this initial increase in flares was reported as a barrier for ULT adherence. Also, nonadherence to ULT was attributed to a lack of awareness regarding the necessary ULT regimen and its significance in treating gout. Some patients thought they should only take ULT when having a flare and used medication accordingly. Furthermore, patient skills were reported as a barrier for self‐management. Patients experienced issues with getting medication refills, planning their medication regimen ahead when traveling, or had trouble reading labels. Finally, patients accidentally forgot to take medication, for example when traveling or due to having too many pills and forgetting to collect prescriptions. In terms of diet, gaining more knowledge led to avoidance of trigger foods and alcohol.

Acceptance of disease

Patients reported that acceptance of having gout led to improved medication adherence and lifestyle modification. In contrast, not accepting the disease led to resistance to ULT. Finally, masculinity caused reluctance to seek medical attention because men wanted to avoid the embarrassment of admitting severe pain in a small body part.

### Gout: one year in review 2023 [^2b8c7bb7]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Gout is a chronic joint disease caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals into and around the articular tissues. In the last two years, new insights regarding diagnosis, genetic involvement, pathogenesis, comorbidities, and clinical data, have allowed the identification of new strategies to improve the control of the disease and its flares. In keeping, the discover of new mechanisms concerning crystal-induced inflammation have suggested new ways for the management not only of gout, but also other systemic diseases, mainly including renal and cardiovascular disorders. In this context it is very representative the case of colchicine which, given the surprising results obtained both in laboratory and clinical experiments, has recently received by FDA the approval for the prevention of cardiovascular disorders.

### Unusual clinical presentations of gout [^f78c4101]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The dogmatic description of gout is described as an inflammatory crystal-induced arthropathy that afflicts peripheral joints. This manuscript describes many recent cases and unusual clinical presentations of gout. Emphasis is placed on the ability of gout to cause diagnostic dilemmas that can impact patient treatment and care.

Recent Findings

Various genetic mutations can predispose patients in developing early onset gout. Environmental exposures, medications, and certain patient populations can affect pathophysiology of uric acid, predisposing patients both typical and atypical manifestations of gout. Numerous reports have described gout deposition in unusual parts of the body, which can mimic unrelated disease processes.

Summary

Although classic gout is still most commonly seen, the disease can manifest as with a wide array of presentations. It is likely that such atypical presentations are a result of a complexity of reasons. When presented with a diagnostic challenge in a patient with gout, the clinician should be aware of unusual manifestations of gout and consider it in the differential.

### Determinants of self-management behavior in gout: a scoping review [^4d94feca]. Arthritis Care & Research (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Gout is a chronic disease caused by deposition of monosodium urate crystals in joints and soft tissue, which can occur in a state of hyperuricemia. These crystals trigger an immune response that results in painful arthritis. Despite available and effective management options, gout treatment is often suboptimal, with cited ranges of approximately 20% to 36% of all patients with gout treated in primary care being under the target serum uric acid (sUA) levels of ≤ 36 mmol/L, therefore causing patients to continue experiencing flares. This poor result has various causes, such as insufficient knowledge about the disease and its management among patients and health professionals and nonadherence to (non)pharmacological interventions. Inadequate treatment and subsequent flares decrease quality of life and functioning, increasing burden on patients, the health care system, and society through higher health care resource use and work productivity losses.

SIGNIFICANCE & INNOVATIONS

Modifiable determinants were identified for almost all domains of the Theoretical Domains Framework, which can act as targets for interventions.
Most studies on determinants of self‐management behavior in patients with gout assess medication adherence as self‐management outcome.
Results on determinants of self‐management behavior concerning lifestyle and care‐seeking behavior are scarce.

Given the suboptimal treatment and expected rise of patients with gout without a proportionate rise in health care resources and personnel, stimulating self‐management is a promising solution to improve care. Self‐management concerns an individual's ability to manage symptoms, treatment, physical and psychological consequences, and lifestyle changes inherent to living with a chronic illness. Self‐management in patients with gout is important because it enables individuals to effectively treat flares and adhere to long‐term medication and lifestyle adjustments. However, several studies indicate suboptimal self‐management behavior, such as a lack of lifestyle changes and treatment adherence.

### Gout: can management be improved? [^1501f8e5]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2001). Low credibility.

Ongoing reviews of Cochrane collaboration show that there is still very little reliable information based on randomized controlled trials on which to base treatment decisions in acute and chronic gout. Recent studies have stressed that avoidance of factors contributing to development of gouty attacks such as diuretic therapy, weight gain, and alcohol consumption may lead to a decrease in gouty arthritis. Attention to minidose aspirin and its effect on serum uric acid levels was addressed. A low carbohydrate, high protein and unsaturated fat diet was recommended for gouty patients since they all enhance insulin sensitivity and therefore may promote a reduction in serum uric acid levels. Treatment of gout in transplant recipients brings into focus some of the issues regarding management of gout, because gout is a common problem among transplant patients.

### Efficacy and cost-effectiveness of nurse-led care involving education and engagement of patients and a Treat-to-target urate-lowering strategy versus usual care for gout: a randomised controlled trial [^2b3e2fe3]. Lancet (2018). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Gout is the most common inflammatory arthritis worldwide, and in the UK the prevalence has risen from 1·5% in 1997 to 2·5% in 2012. Gout results from sodium urate crystals that form when serum urate persistently exceeds saturation. Deposition of sodium urate crystals can cause extremely painful gout flares or attacks, joint damage, and subcutaneous nodules (tophi). Furthermore, gout and hyperuricaemia are associated with various comorbidities, increased mortality, and reduced quality of life. The causes of hyperuricaemia are known, and urate-lowering treatments can maintain serum urate concentrations at less than saturation, which prevents crystal formation and dissolves existing crystals, making gout the only common arthritis where the pathogenic agent can be eliminated. Addressing risk factors for hyperuricaemia (eg, overweight, excessive alcohol intake, high dietary intake of purines and fructose) is advised as well as medical treatment, but alone rarely reduces concentrations of serum urate sufficiently to alter the disease course.

### Global, regional, and national burden of gout, 1990–2020, and projections to 2050: a systematic analysis of the global burden of disease study 2021 [^79ff5093]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Although non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications are beneficial in the treatment of acute gout flares, ongoing prevention of recurring gout can be achieved by lowering uric acid through the use of urate lowering therapy, in addition to low-dose anti-inflammatory medications. There is evidence to support a treat-to-target approach for lowering serum urate, which can suppress gout flares and prevent joint and other end organ damage in the long term by reducing the total body load of urate tissue deposits. However, it has been reported that suboptimal treatment of gout occurs in many countries, with only a third to half of patients with gout receiving urate-lowering therapy, and fewer than half of patients adhering to the long-term treatment that is needed. Suboptimal treatment might lead to unnecessary development of disabling erosive gout. One of the most important strategies to reduce the ongoing burden of gout is improving education around adherence to treatment. The ability to do this is likely to vary across regions and might contribute to the differences seen across regions.

Our forecasts showed that the prevalence of gout is estimated to be up to 96 million in 2050. Unfortunately, these forecasts cannot yet be based on forecasted rates of risk factors including high BMI and kidney dysfunction, and SDI has been taken as a proxy in the forecasting process. It is known that global rates of overweight and obesity are increasing, so the actual forecasted prevalence rate could be higher if the increase in obesity is greater than the increase in SDI. The impact of COVID-19 on forecast estimates for gout is also not yet known. As with many other conditions, maintaining a healthy bodyweight could reduce the prevalence of gout, in addition to controlling the underlying conditions for the development of kidney impairment, such as hypertension and diabetes. Designing programmes for the early detection and treatment of kidney diseases can prevent further complications.

### Improving outcomes for patients hospitalized with gout: a systematic review [^862d2bc8]. Rheumatology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Hospital admissions for gout flares have increased dramatically in recent years, despite widely available, effective medications for the treatment and prevention of flares. We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness and implementation of interventions in patients hospitalized for gout flares.

Methods

A search was conducted in MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane library, from database inception to 8 April 2021, using the terms 'gout' and 'hospital' and their synonyms. Studies were included if they evaluated the effectiveness and/or implementation of interventions during hospital admissions or emergency department attendances for gout flares. Risk of bias assessments were performed for included studies.

Results

Nineteen articles were included. Most studies were small, retrospective analyses performed in single centres, with concerns for bias. Eleven studies (including five randomized controlled trials) reported improved patient outcomes following pharmacological interventions with known efficacy in gout, including allopurinol, prednisolone, NSAIDs and anakinra. Eight studies reported improved outcomes associated with non-pharmacological interventions: inpatient rheumatology consultation and a hospital gout management protocol. No studies to date have prospectively evaluated strategies designed to prevent re-admissions of patients hospitalized for gout flares.

Conclusion

There is an urgent need for high-quality, prospective studies of strategies for improving uptake of urate-lowering therapies in hospitalized patients, incorporating prophylaxis against flares and treat-to-target optimization of serum urate levels. Such studies are essential if the epidemic of hospital admissions from this treatable condition is to be countered.

### Global, regional, and national burden of gout, 1990–2020, and projections to 2050: a systematic analysis of the global burden of disease study 2021 [^d5f932ff]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis, manifesting as acute flares of severe joint pain, swelling, redness, and warmth in one or more joints, which can progress to chronic destructive arthropathy. The prevalence of gout is higher in males than females, and increases with age. Although a high serum urate concentration is the most important risk factor for the development of gout, genetic factors have a strong influence on the occurrence of gout, and a range of risk factors, such as medications, comorbidities, and environmental exposures, are also implicated. Many factors that contribute to hyperuricaemia are also risk factors for incident gout, including obesity, metabolic syndrome, and chronic kidney disease, factors commonly seen in younger people with gout. Gout has been associated with cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal comorbidities.

Effective management strategies for gout include treatment of the acute flares and ameliorating the long-term consequences that contribute to disability. Current recommendations for managing acute flares include the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, or glucocorticoids. To prevent recurrent gout flares, the primary goal is to reduce serum urate concentrations, and lifelong administration of urate-lowering drugs is crucial. Lifestyle modifications (eg, bodyweight loss) and educational programmes focusing on dietary improvement could also be useful for long-term prevention of episodes or flares in people with gout.

Gout can lead to reduced mobility and impaired physical function, contributing to work absenteeism. In addition to its physical impacts, gout imposes an economic cost on those with the condition, with costs rising with increasing serum urate concentrations and the number of flares. Untreated gout places a substantial burden on the global health system, as chronic gout causes tophi formation, chronic joint pain, and erosion and damage to joints, resulting in an increase in morbidity and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Furthermore, despite advances in the treatment of gout, it is still underdiagnosed and undertreated, and is associated with an increased risk of mortality and comorbidities. Therefore, quantifying the burden and pattern of gout cases by age and sex, as well as making projections for the future, are necessary to efficiently target the current and future needs of the population. We aimed to report the global, regional, and national burden and trends associated with gout and the burden attributed to risk factors, in terms of prevalence and age-standardised rates, from 1990 to 2020, as well as projections up to 2050.

### Gout and its comorbidities: implications for therapy [^aa46bd78]. Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Gout is a common form of arthritis. It is associated with a number of comorbidities, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, renal impairment, diabetes, obesity, hyperlipidaemia and frequently in a combination known as the metabolic syndrome. These comorbidities and their treatment may have an effect on the development of gout and on the choice of therapeutic agent. Treatment of acute gout with short-term corticosteroids may be a safer option than either NSAIDs or colchicine in patients with significant renal and/or cardiac impairment. Sustained reduction of serum urate < 0.36 mmol/l is required for long-term management of gout. The optimal dosing regimen for patients with renal impairment is the subject of on-going investigation. There is less experience with newer urate-lowering therapies. This review will consider the relationship between comorbidities and gout with a particular focus on the treatment of gout and the potential interactions between drugs used for gout and those for comorbid conditions.

### Gout medicine febuxostat (uloric) [^6506e6d1]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Welcome to the FDA Drug Safety Podcast for health care professionals from the Division of Drug Information. This is Lesley Navin Advanced Practice Nurse. On November 15, 2017, FDA alerted the public that preliminary results from a safety clinical trial show an increased risk of heart-related death with febuxostat compared to another gout medicine called allopurinol. We required the Uloric drug manufacturer, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, to conduct this safety study when we approved the medicine in 2009. Once we receive the final results from the manufacturer, we will conduct a comprehensive review and will update the public with any new information. Febuxostat is FDA-approved to treat a type of arthritis called gout in adults. Gout happens when a naturally occurring substance in the body called uric acid builds up and causes sudden attacks of redness, swelling, and pain in one or more joints. Febuxostat works by lowering uric acid levels in the blood.

The febuxostat drug labels already carry a Warning and Precaution about cardiovascular events because the clinical trials conducted before approval showed a higher rate of heart-related problems in patients treated with febuxostat compared to allopurinol. These problems included heart attacks, strokes, and heart-related deaths. As a result, we required an additional safety clinical trial after the drug was approved and on the market to better understand these differences, and that trial was finished recently. The safety trial was conducted in over 6, 000 patients with gout treated with either febuxostat or allopurinol. The primary outcome was a combination of heart-related death, non-deadly heart attack, non-deadly stroke, and a condition of inadequate blood supply to the heart requiring urgent surgery. The preliminary results show that overall, febuxostat did not increase the risk of these combined events compared to allopurinol.

However, when the outcomes were evaluated separately, febuxostat showed an increased risk of heart-related deaths and death from all causes. Health care professionals should consider this safety information when deciding whether to prescribe or continue patients on febuxostat. We are continuing to evaluate this safety issue and will update the public when we have more information. We urge health care professionals and patients to report side effects involving febuxostat to FDA's MedWatch program at www. fda. gov/medwatch.

### Colchicine for acute gout [^5138ace2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

This is an update of a Cochrane review first published in 2006. Gout is one of the most common rheumatic diseases worldwide. Despite the use of colchicine as one of the first-line therapies for the treatment of acute gout, evidence for its benefits and harms is relatively limited.

Objectives

To evaluate the benefits and harms of colchicine for the treatment of acute gout.

Search Methods

We searched the following electronic databases from inception to April 2014: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE. We did not impose any date or language restrictions in the search. We also handsearched conference proceedings of the American College of Rheumatology and the European League against Rheumatism (2010 until 2013) and reference lists of identified studies. We searched the clinical trials register clinicaltrials.gov and the WHO trials register.

Selection Criteria

We considered published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and controlled clinical trials (CCTs) evaluating colchicine therapy compared with another therapy (active or placebo) in acute gout. The primary benefit outcome of interest was pain, defined as a proportion with 50% or greater decrease in pain, and the primary harm outcome was study participants withdrawal due to adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened search results for relevant studies, extracted data into a standardised form and assessed the risk of bias of included studies. We pooled data if deemed to be sufficiently clinically homogeneous. We assessed the quality of the body of evidence for each outcome using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

Two RCTs (124 participants) were included in this updated review, including one new RCT. We considered one trial to be at low risk of bias, while we considered the newly included trial to be at unclear risk of bias. Both trials included a placebo and a high-dose colchicine arm, although the colchicine regimens varied. In one trial 0.5 mg colchicine was given every two hours until there was either complete relief of symptoms or toxicity and the total doses were not specified. In the other trial a total of 4.8 mg colchicine was given over six hours. The newly identified trial also included a low-dose colchicine arm (total 1.8 mg over one hour). Based upon pooled data from two trials (124 participants), there is low-quality evidence that a greater proportion of people receiving high-dose colchicine experience a 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours compared with placebo (35/74 in the high-dose colchicine group versus 12/50 in the placebo group (risk ratio (RR) 2.16, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.28 to 3.65), with a number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) of 4 (95% CI 3 to 12). However, the total number of adverse events (diarrhoea, vomiting or nausea) is greater in those who receive high-dose colchicine versus placebo (62/74 in the high-dose colchicine group versus 11/50 in the placebo group (RR 3.81, 95% CI 2.28 to 6.38), with a number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) of 2 (95% CI 2 to 5). Only one trial included reduction of inflammation as part of a composite measure comprising pain, tenderness, swelling and erythema, each graded on a four-point scale (none 0 to severe 3) to derive a maximum score for any one joint of 12. They reported the proportion of people who achieved a 50% reduction in this composite score. Based upon one trial (43 participants), there was low-quality evidence that more people in the high-dose colchicine group had a 50% or greater decrease in composite score from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours than people in the placebo group (11/22 in the high-dose colchicine group versus 1/21 in the placebo group (RR 10.50, 95% CI 1.48 to 74.38) and 45% absolute difference). Based upon data from one trial (103 participants), there was low-quality evidence that low-dose colchicine is more efficacious than placebo with respect to the proportion of people who achieve a 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline to 32 to 36 hours (low-dose colchicine 31/74 versus placebo 5/29 (RR 2.43, 95% CI 1.05 to 5.64)), with a NNTB of 5 (95% CI 2 to 20). There are no additional harms in terms of adverse events (diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting) with low-dose colchicine compared to placebo (19/74 and 6/29 respectively (RR 1.24, 95% CI 0.55 to 2.79)). Based upon data from one trial (126 participants), there is low-quality evidence that there are no additional benefits in terms of the proportion of people achieving 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours with high-dose colchicine compared to low-dose (19/52 and 31/74 respectively (RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.36). However, there were statistically significantly more adverse events in those who received high-dose colchicine (40/52 versus 19/74 in the low-dose group (RR 3.00, 95% CI 1.98 to 4.54)), with a NNTH of 2 (95% CI 2 to 3). No trials reported function of the target joint, patient-reported global assessment of treatment success, health-related quality of life or withdrawals due to adverse events. We identified no studies comparing colchicine to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or other active treatments such as glucocorticoids (by any route).

Authors' Conclusions

Based upon only two published trials, there is low-quality evidence that low-dose colchicine is likely to be an effective treatment for acute gout. We downgraded the evidence because of a possible risk of selection and reporting biases and imprecision. Both high and low-dose colchicine improve pain when compared to placebo. While there is some uncertainty around the effect estimates, compared with placebo, high-dose but not low-dose colchicine appears to result in a statistically significantly greater number of adverse events. Therefore low-dose colchicine may be the preferred treatment option. There are no trials about the effect of colchicine in populations with comorbidities or in comparison with other commonly used treatments, such as NSAIDs and glucocorticoids.

### Association of uric acid-lowering therapies on gout frequency with bempedoic acid: clinical insights from CLEAR outcomes [^49e852cb]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

What is the clinical question being addressed?

Does uric acid–lowering medication use impact gout adverse events in patients receiving bempedoic acid, with or without prior gout and/or baseline elevated uric acid?

What is the main finding?

Gout incidence was lower with uric acid–lowering medication use during CLEAR Outcomes.

Table 1
Uric Acid–Lowering Medication Use and Incidence of Gout Adverse Events by History of Gout or Elevated Uric Acid Level at Baseline

Among patients without prior gout or elevated UA, gout was infrequent in both treatment groups (< 1%). For patients with prior gout who never received UA-lowering medications during follow-up, 2.2% of bempedoic acid patients and 0.6% of placebo patients experienced gout. When a UA-lowering medication was used, either at baseline or after a gout event, the incidence of gout was similar to or lower in bempedoic acid–treated patients vs placebo (3.2% vs 9.1% and 0.5% vs 0%, respectively). In patients with elevated UA but no history of gout, incidence of gout among those who never received UA-lowering therapies occurred twice as often with bempedoic acid (1.7%) vs placebo (0.7%) but occurred less often with any use of UA-lowering therapies either at baseline or after an episode of gout (< 1%) in both bempedoic acid and placebo patients. Patients with both a prior history of gout and elevated UA had the highest use of UA-lowering medications at baseline (43.7% for bempedoic acid and 40.8% for placebo) and the highest overall incidence of gout in both treatment groups (20.5% in bempedoic acid and 26.2% in placebo). In this subset of patients, gout occurred less frequently when UA-lowering medications were used at baseline for both bempedoic acid (6.8%) and placebo (11.0%), and after these medications were initiated during the study (3.2% and 2.1%, respectively). The adjusted hazard ratios for the effect of bempedoic acid on MACE-4 was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.63–1.21) in those with a prior history of gout (n = 720) and was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.79–0.96) among those without (n = 13,245) (P interaction = 1.00).

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^44adb76c]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

American College of Rheumatology gout flare management — For patients experiencing a gout flare, the guideline states "we strongly recommend using oral colchicine, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids (oral, intramuscular, or intraarticular) as appropriate first-line therapy for gout flares over IL-1 inhibitors or ACTH", and "when colchicine is the chosen agent, we strongly recommend low-dose colchicine over high-dose colchicine given its similar efficacy and fewer adverse effects". For patients who are unable to take oral medications, "we strongly recommend glucocorticoids (intramuscular, intravenous, or intraarticular) over IL-1 inhibitors or ACTH". If other antiinflammatory therapies are poorly tolerated or contraindicated, "we conditionally recommend using IL-1 inhibition over no therapy (beyond supportive/analgesic treatment)". As adjunctive care for a flare, "we conditionally recommend using topical ice as an adjuvant treatment over no adjuvant treatment". For colchicine dosing during flares, the guideline notes "the FDA-approved dosing should be followed (1.2 mg immediately followed by 0.6 mg an hour later, with ongoing antiinflammatory therapy until the flare resolves)".

### Gout [^903698b8]. Lancet (2016). Excellent credibility.

Gout is a chronic disease of deposition of monosodium urate crystals, which form in the presence of increased urate concentrations. Although environmental factors contribute to hyperuricaemia, renal and gut excretion of urate is central to regulation of serum urate, and genetic factors are important. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and release of interleukin 1β have key roles in initiation of acute gout flares. A "treat to target serum urate" approach is essential for effective gout management; long-term lowering of serum urate to less than 360 μmol/L leads to crystal dissolution and ultimately to suppression of flares. An allopurinol dose-escalation strategy is frequently effective for achieving treatment targets, and several new urate-lowering drugs are also available. Worldwide, rates of initiation and continuation of urate-lowering therapy are very low, and, consequently, achievement of serum urate targets is infrequent. Strategies to improve quality of gout care are needed.

### Spontaneous resolution of acute gout: mechanisms and therapeutic targets [^f35439b8]. RMD Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Gout is a common inflammatory arthritis that has been increasing in both prevalence and incidence. Consequently, management of refractory and chronic gout has been gaining attention. Onset of gout is related to the deposition of monosodium urate crystals under hyperuricaemia. Interestingly, acute gout attacks often resolve spontaneously within 7–10 days, and many studies have confirmed the notion that gout flares can be self-relieved. However, the underlying mechanism for spontaneous remission of gout requires further elucidation. In this article, we summarise the roles and mechanisms related to spontaneous remission of gout, which are essential for understanding its pathogenesis and developing potential targeted therapies.

### Gout: will the "King of diseases" be the first rheumatic disease to be cured? [^53b4ded4]. BMC Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Gout as an inflammatory disease

The link between inflammasome and associated inflammation in gout is now well understood. The NALP3 (also called cryopyrin) inflammasome complex is a key regulator of the innate inflammatory phenotype of several diseases, including gout and type 2 diabetes. Martinon et al. showed that (1) monosodium urate crystals engaged caspase-1, leading to NALP3 activation and to an increase in active interleukin (IL)-1b and IL-18 production; (2) induced macrophages from mice deficient in various inflammasome components, such as caspase-1, ASC, and NALP3, were defective in urate crystal-induced activation of IL-1b; and (3) an impaired neutrophil influx was also found in an in vivo model of crystal-induced peritonitis in inflammasome-deficient mice or mice deficient in the IL-1b receptor. Additional evidence of the role of IL-1 in acute inflammation in gout was shown in a murine model of gout, where inflammation following monosodium urate injection into the mouse ankle joint was significantly reduced both in mice deficient for the IL-1 receptor and in wild type mice treated with the IL-1 inhibitor IL-1 Trap (rilonacept). Clinical studies showed that treatment with medications targeting anti-IL-1 (IL-1RA [anakinra], IL-1Trap, and anti-IL-1β monoclonal antibody [canakinumab]) were each associated with a rapid response in patients with acute gouty arthritis, thereby reinforcing the argument for an important role for IL-1β in gout pathogenesis.

### EULAR evidence based recommendations for gout. part II: management. report of a task force of the EULAR standing committee for international clinical studies including therapeutics (ESCISIT) [^25f55c58]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop evidence based recommendations for the management of gout.

Methods

The multidisciplinary guideline development group comprised 19 rheumatologists and one evidence based medicine expert representing 13 European countries. Key propositions on management were generated using a Delphi consensus approach. Research evidence was searched systematically for each proposition. Where possible, effect size (ES), number needed to treat, relative risk, odds ratio, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio were calculated. The quality of evidence was categorised according to the level of evidence. The strength of recommendation (SOR) was assessed using the EULAR visual analogue and ordinal scales.

Results

12 key propositions were generated after three Delphi rounds. Propositions included both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatments and addressed symptomatic control of acute gout, urate lowering therapy (ULT), and prophylaxis of acute attacks. The importance of patient education, modification of adverse lifestyle (weight loss if obese; reduced alcohol consumption; low animal purine diet) and treatment of associated comorbidity and risk factors were emphasised. Recommended drugs for acute attacks were oral non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), oral colchicine (ES = 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 1.50)), or joint aspiration and injection of corticosteroid. ULT is indicated in patients with recurrent acute attacks, arthropathy, tophi, or radiographic changes of gout. Allopurinol was confirmed as effective long term ULT (ES = 1.39 (0.78 to 2.01)). If allopurinol toxicity occurs, options include other xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol desensitisation, or a uricosuric. The uricosuric benzbromarone is more effective than allopurinol (ES = 1.50 (0.76 to 2.24)) and can be used in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency but may be hepatotoxic. When gout is associated with the use of diuretics, the diuretic should be stopped if possible. For prophylaxis against acute attacks, either colchicine 0.5–1 mg daily or an NSAID (with gastroprotection if indicated) are recommended.

Conclusions

12 key recommendations for management of gout were developed, using a combination of research based evidence and expert consensus. The evidence was evaluated and the SOR provided for each proposition.

### Newer therapeutic approaches: gout [^1d01b0a5]. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Newer approaches to the treatment of gout have included modifications and further attention to aspects of current therapies, and development of interesting new therapies. Colchicine prophylaxis appears to be needed longer than previously recognized after introduction of a urate-lowering agent. Diet has received attention, though most dietary effects are small. New agents under investigation include pegylated formulations of uricase and a new potent xanthine oxidase inhibitor, febuxostat. Some cardiovascular drugs have been shown to be uricosuric.

### Update on gout: new therapeutic strategies and options [^94de9e78]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2010). Medium credibility.

Gout, a disease recognized since antiquity, has increased in prevalence in recent years and the clinical profile of this disease has become increasingly complex, owing to large numbers of cases with iatrogenic factors, multiple comorbidities, advanced age, and hyperuricemia and arthritis refractory to treatment. In this Review, key advances in gout research made during the past decade are summarized. Revised strategies for safe and effective employment of dietary measures and pharmacologic treatments for active gouty arthritis, prevention of gout flares and urate lowering are also reviewed, with an emphasis on dosing of colchicine and allopurinol, and the evidence-based approach to systemic glucocorticosteroid treatment of acute gout. Also discussed are new and emerging treatments for gout and hyperuricemia, and the potential influence of dual energy CT imaging on treatment. In this context, the therapeutic role of febuxostat, and clinical development of pegylated uricase urate-lowering therapy and interleukin 1 antagonism for gouty inflammation are reviewed. Collectively, novel approaches will hopefully lead to improved management of hyperuricemia and gout, and also to improvements in patient-centered outcomes, even for those who have previously failed to respond to treatment.

### Gout: an update [^ffd5097a]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Arthritis caused by gout (i.e., gouty arthritis) accounts for millions of outpatient visits annually, and the prevalence is increasing. Gout is caused by monosodium urate crystal deposition in tissues leading to arthritis, soft tissue masses (i.e., tophi), nephrolithiasis, and urate nephropathy. The biologic precursor to gout is elevated serum uric acid levels (i.e., hyperuricemia). Asymptomatic hyperuricemia is common and usually does not progress to clinical gout. Acute gout most often presents as attacks of pain, erythema, and swelling of one or a few joints in the lower extremities. The diagnosis is confirmed if monosodium urate crystals are present in synovial fluid. First-line therapy for acute gout is nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids, depending on comorbidities; colchicine is second-line therapy. After the first gout attack, modifiable risk factors (e.g., high-purine diet, alcohol use, obesity, diuretic therapy) should be addressed. Urate-lowering therapy for gout is initiated after multiple attacks or after the development of tophi or urate nephrolithiasis. Allopurinol is the most common therapy for chronic gout. Uricosuric agents are alternative therapies in patients with preserved renal function and no history of nephrolithiasis. During urate-lowering therapy, the dose should be titrated upward until the serum uric acid level is less than 6 mg per dL (355 micromol per L). When initiating urate-lowering therapy, concurrent prophylactic therapy with low-dose colchicine for three to six months may reduce flare-ups.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute gout [^e43ae695]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Gout is an inflammatory arthritis that is characterised by the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in synovial fluid and other tissues. The natural history of articular gout is generally characterised by three periods: asymptomatic hyperuricaemia, episodes of acute gout and chronic gouty arthritis. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (COXIBs) are commonly used to treat acute gout. Published guidelines recommend their use to treat acute attacks, using maximum recommended doses for a short time.

Objectives

To assess the benefit and safety of NSAIDs (including COXIBs) for acute gout.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE and EMBASE for studies to 7 October 2013, the 2010 and 2011 ACR and EULAR abstracts and performed a handsearch of reference lists of articles. We searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trial register and ClinicalTrials.gov. We applied no date or language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We considered all published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled clinical trials that compared NSAIDs with placebo or another therapy (including non-pharmacological therapies) for acute gout. Major outcomes were pain (proportion with 50% or more reduction in pain or mean pain when the dichotomous outcome was unavailable), inflammation (e.g. measured by joint swelling/erythema/tenderness), function of target joint, participant's global assessment of treatment success, health-related quality of life, withdrawals due to adverse events and total adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected the studies for inclusion, extracted the data, performed a risk of bias assessment and assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach.

Main Results

We included 23 trials (2200 participants). One trial (30 participants) of low-quality evidence compared an NSAID (tenoxicam) with placebo. It found that significantly more participants had more than 50% reduction in pain after 24 hours (11/15 participants) compared with those taking placebo (4/15 participants) (risk ratio (RR) 2.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13 to 6.72). A similar outcome was seen for more than 50% improvement in joint swelling after 24 hours (5/15 participants taking NSAIDs versus 2/15 participants taking placebo; RR 2.50, 95% CI 0.57 to 10.93). The trial did not measure function, participant global assessment of treatment success and health-related quality of life. There were no adverse events reported with the use of tenoxicam; two adverse events (nausea and polypuria) were reported in the placebo group. No between-group differences in outcome were observed after four days. Moderate-quality evidence based upon four trials (974 participants) indicated that NSAIDs and COXIBs produced similar benefits in terms of pain, swelling and global improvement, but COXIBs were associated with fewer adverse events. Pain reduction was 1.9 points on a 0- to 10-point scale with COXIBs (0 was no pain) while pain reduction with NSAIDs was 0.03 points lower or better (mean difference (MD) -0.03, 95% CI -0.19 to 0.13). Joint swelling in the COXIB group was 1.64 points on a 0- to 3-point scale (0 is no swelling) and 0.13 points higher with NSAIDs (MD 0.13, 95% CI -0.08 to 0.34). Function was not reported. Participant-reported global assessment was 1.56 points on a 0- to 4-point scale with COXIBs (0 was the best score) and was 0.04 points higher with NSAIDs (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.20). Health-related quality of life assessed using the 36-item Short Form showed no evidence of a statistically significant between-group difference (MD 0.49, 95% CI -1.61 to 2.60 for the physical component). There were significantly fewer withdrawals due to adverse events in participants treated with COXIBs (3%) compared with NSAIDs (8%) (RR 2.39, 95% CI 1.34 to 4.28). There was a significantly lower number of total adverse events in participants treated with COXIBs (38%) compared with NSAIDs (60%) (RR 1.56, 95% CI 1.30 to 1.86). There was moderate-quality evidence based on two trials (210 participants) that oral glucocorticoids did not differ in pain reduction, function or adverse events when compared with NSAIDs. Pain reduction was 9.5 on a 0- to 100-point scale with glucocorticoids, pain reduction with NSAIDs was 1.74 higher or worse (MD 1.74, 95% CI -1.44 to 4.92). The trials did not assess inflammation. Function measured as walking disability was 17.4 points on a 0- to 100-point scale with glucocorticoids, function with NSAIDs was 0.1 lower or better (MD -0.10, 95% CI -4.72 to 4.52). The trials did not measure participant-reported global assessment and health-related quality of life. There were no withdrawals due to adverse events. There was no evidence of a difference in total number of adverse events with glucocorticoids (31%) versus NSAIDs (49%) (RR 1.58, 95% CI 0.76 to 3.28).

Authors' Conclusions

Limited evidence supported the use of NSAIDs in the treatment of acute gout. One placebo-controlled trial provided evidence of benefit at 24 hours and little or no harm. We downgraded the evidence due to potential selection and reporting biases, and imprecision. While these data were insufficient to draw firm conclusions, they did not conflict with clinical guideline recommendations based upon evidence from observational studies, other inflammatory arthritis and expert consensus, which support the use of NSAIDs in acute gout. Moderate-quality evidence suggested that selective COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs are probably equally beneficial although COX-2 inhibitors are likely to be associated with significantly fewer total and gastrointestinal adverse events. We downgraded the evidence due to an unclear risk of selection and reporting biases. Moderate-quality evidence indicated that systemic glucocorticoids and NSAIDs were also equally beneficial in terms of pain relief. There were no withdrawals due to adverse events and total adverse events were similar between groups. We downgraded the evidence due to unclear risk of selection and reporting bias. There was low-quality evidence that there was no difference in function. We downgraded the quality due to unclear risk of selection bias and imprecision.

### Impact of comorbidities on gout and hyperuricaemia: an update on prevalence and treatment options [^ae8b910e]. BMC Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Gout is a prevalent disorder whose frequency is increasing worldwide. In addition to causing excruciating arthritic pain, gout is associated with premature death, classically explained by a high frequency of comorbidities, especially renal and cardiovascular diseases. Comorbidities must be considered in gout because they could contribute to the vital prognosis of gouty patients and they complicate gout management. These comorbidities are also frequently associated with asymptomatic hyperuricaemia, an even more prevalent condition than gout, with their causal relationship with hyperuricaemia raising important therapeutic issues.

### Impact of television depictions of gout on perceptions of illness: a randomized controlled trial [^f5bccf74]. Arthritis Care & Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Gout is a chronic disease that can be effectively managed with long-term urate-lowering therapy. However, it is frequently portrayed on screen as an acute disease caused by a poor diet that should be managed with lifestyle changes. This study was undertaken to investigate the impact of a fictional television depiction of gout on perceptions of the disease and its management.

Methods

In a randomized controlled single-blind study, 200 members of the public watched either a 19-minute commercial television comedy episode that depicted gout as an acute disease caused by poor diet and managed with lifestyle changes, or a control episode from the same television series that did not mention gout or other diseases. Participants completed a survey regarding their perceptions of gout, its likely causes, and management strategies.

Results

Participants randomized to watch the gout-related episode believed gout had greater consequences (mean score of 7.1 versus 6.2 on an 11-point Likert scale; P < 0.001) and were more likely to rank the most important cause as poor eating habits compared to the control group (70% versus 38%; P < 0.001). They were also less likely to believe it is caused by genetic factors or chance. Participants watching the gout-related episode believed a change in diet would be a more effective management strategy (9.0 versus 8.4; P = 0.004) and long-term medication use would be less effective (6.9 versus 7.6; P = 0.007) compared to participants in the control group.

Conclusion

Television depictions of gout can perpetuate inaccurate beliefs regarding causes of the disease and underemphasize effective medical strategies required in chronic disease management.

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for acute gout [^560eed0d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Gout is an inflammatory arthritis resulting from the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in and around joints. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used to treat acute gout. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2014.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (including cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (COXIBs)) for acute gout.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase for studies to 28 August 2020. We applied no date or language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs comparing NSAIDs with placebo or another therapy for acute gout. Major outcomes were pain, inflammation, function, participant-reported global assessment, quality of life, withdrawals due to adverse events, and total adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane.

Main Results

We included in this update 28 trials (3406 participants), including 5 new trials. One trial (30 participants) compared NSAIDs to placebo, 6 (1244 participants) compared non-selective NSAIDs to selective cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (COXIBs), 5 (712 participants) compared NSAIDs to glucocorticoids, 13 compared one NSAID to another NSAID (633 participants), and single trials compared NSAIDs to rilonacept (225 participants), acupuncture (163 participants), and colchicine (399 participants). Most trials were at risk of selection, performance, and detection biases. We report numerical data for the primary comparison NSAIDs versus placebo and brief results for the two comparisons - NSAIDs versus COX-2 inhibitors and NSAIDs versus glucocorticoids. Low-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision) from 1 trial (30 participants) shows NSAIDs compared to placebo. More participants (11/15) may have a 50% reduction in pain at 24 hours with NSAIDs than with placebo (4/15) (risk ratio (RR) 2.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1 to 6.7), with absolute improvement of 47% (3.5% more to 152.5% more). NSAIDs may have little to no effect on inflammation (swelling) after four days (13/15 participants taking NSAIDs versus 12/15 participants taking placebo; RR 1.1, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.5), with absolute improvement of 6.4% (16.8% fewer to 39.2% more). There may be little to no difference in function (4-point scale; 1 = complete resolution) at 24 hours (4/15 participants taking NSAIDs versus 1/15 participants taking placebo; RR 4.0, 95% CI 0.5 to 31.7), with absolute improvement of 20% (3.3% fewer to 204.9% more). NSAIDs may result in little to no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events (0 events in both groups) or in total adverse events; two adverse events (nausea and polyuria) were reported in the placebo group (RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.0, 3.8), with absolute difference of 10.7% more (13.2% fewer to 38% more). Treatment success and health-related quality of life were not measured. Moderate-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias) from 6 trials (1244 participants) shows non-selective NSAIDs compared to selective COX-2 inhibitors (COXIBs). Non-selective NSAIDs probably result in little to no difference in pain (mean difference (MD) 0.03, 95% CI 0.07 lower to 0.14 higher), swelling (MD 0.08, 95% CI 0.07 lower to 0.22 higher), treatment success (MD 0.08, 95% CI 0.04 lower to 0.2 higher), or quality of life (MD -0.2, 95% CI -6.7 to 6.3) compared to COXIBs. Low-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias and imprecision) suggests no difference in function (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.25) between groups. Non-selective NSAIDs probably increase withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 2.3, 95% CI 1.3 to 4.1) and total adverse events (mainly gastrointestinal) (RR 1.9, 95% CI 1.4 to 2.8). Moderate-certainty evidence (downgraded for bias) based on 5 trials (712 participants) shows NSAIDs compared to glucocorticoids. NSAIDs probably result in little to no difference in pain (MD 0.1, 95% CI -2.7 to 3.0), inflammation (MD 0.3, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.6), function (MD -0.2, 95% CI -2.2 to 1.8), or treatment success (RR 0.9, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.2). There was no difference in withdrawals due to adverse events with NSAIDs compared to glucocorticoids (RR 2.8, 95% CI 0.5 to 14.2). There was a decrease in total adverse events with glucocorticoids compared to NSAIDs (RR 1.6, 95% CI 1.0 to 2.5).

Authors' Conclusions

Low-certainty evidence from 1 placebo-controlled trial suggests that NSAIDs may improve pain at 24 hours and may have little to no effect on function, inflammation, or adverse events for treatment of acute gout. Moderate-certainty evidence shows that COXIBs and non-selective NSAIDs are probably equally beneficial with regards to improvement in pain, function, inflammation, and treatment success, although non-selective NSAIDs probably increase withdrawals due to adverse events and total adverse events. Moderate-certainty evidence shows that systemic glucocorticoids and NSAIDs probably are equally beneficial in terms of pain relief, improvement in function, and treatment success. Withdrawals due to adverse events were also similar between groups, but NSAIDs probably result in more total adverse events. Low-certainty evidence suggests no difference in inflammation between groups. Only low-certainty evidence was available for the comparisons NSAID versus rilonacept and NSAID versus acupuncture from single trials, or one NSAID versus another NSAID, which also included many NSAIDs that are no longer in clinical use. Although these data were insufficient to support firm conclusions, they do not conflict with clinical guideline recommendations based upon evidence from observational studies, findings for other inflammatory arthritis, and expert consensus, all of which support the use of NSAIDs for acute gout.

### 2020 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the management of gout [^29230ad4]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2020). High credibility.

American College of Rheumatology gout guideline — management of concurrent medications states: Switching hydrochlorothiazide to an alternate antihypertensive when feasible is conditionally recommended for patients with gout, regardless of disease activity. Choosing losartan preferentially as an antihypertensive agent when feasible is conditionally recommended for patients with gout, regardless of disease activity. Stopping low-dose aspirin (for patients who are taking this medication for appropriate indications) is conditionally recommended against for patients with gout, regardless of disease activity. Adding or switching cholesterol-lowering agents to fenofibrate is conditionally recommended against for patients with gout, regardless of disease activity. Switching, stopping, or adding a medication should only be considered when the potential SU concentration/gout benefits exceed the potential risks or harms of the medication change. Recognizing that there are few practical alternatives to low-dose aspirin, the Voting Panel specifically recommended against its cessation as a means of SU reduction when a patient is taking it for an appropriate indication.

### Prognostic factors for colchicine prophylaxis-related adverse events when initiating allopurinol for gout: retrospective cohort study [^a39ac2f6]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Gout is caused by high serum urate levels leading to the formation of MSU crystals in and around joints. It is the most prevalent inflammatory arthritis and affects 2.5% of adults in the UK and 3.9% in the USA. Gout is characterized by recurrent flares of excruciating joint pain and inflammation, and is associated with substantial comorbidity and impaired health-related quality of life. Urate-lowering therapy (ULT) for gout leads to gradual dissolution of MSU crystals and cessation of flares over several months. However, initiating or escalating the dose of ULT often precipitates a gout flare, which may lead patients or practitioners to stop ULT, as they believe that it has exacerbated the gout. Anti-inflammatory prophylaxis to prevent such flares, most commonly with colchicine, is therefore recommended for several months when initiating ULT.

Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting are common side-effects of colchicine, but rarely, it can cause more serious side-effects such as myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, neuropathy or bone marrow suppression. We recently reported a cohort study which determined the risk of adverse events severe enough to warrant seeking healthcare associated with colchicine prophylaxis when initiating allopurinol in patients with gout in UK primary care. We found that adverse events affected 1 in 15 people taking colchicine. However, serious adverse events were rare.

The risk of side-effects due to colchicine prophylaxis is thought to be influenced by patient characteristics. For example, the risk of serious events including neuromyopathy, rhabdomyolysis and bone marrow suppression is higher in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD), which affects one in four people with gout, and in people taking certain medications. Through its metabolism by CYP3A4, colchicine toxicity is theoretically increased by concomitant treatment with common drugs such as statins, fibrates, macrolide antibiotics, rate-limiting calcium-channel blockers (verapamil, diltiazem), digoxin, amiodarone and antifungals, as well as protease inhibitors and ciclosporin. Although colchicine is contraindicated in patients taking these medications, in our clinical experience from primary and secondary care, their co-prescription still commonly occurs. However, evidence that these factors are prognostic for adverse events is largely anecdotal or theoretical, and large research studies are lacking.

In this study, we aimed to assess to what degree co-prescriptions and other potential prognostic factors for adverse events, including age, gender, BMI, CKD and multimorbidity, affect the risk of adverse events when commencing colchicine prophylaxis for ULT in people with gout.

### Colchicine for acute gout [^4f70a8a2]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

This is an updated Cochrane Review, first published in 2006 and updated in 2014. Gout is one of the most common rheumatic diseases worldwide. Despite the use of colchicine as one of the first-line therapies for the treatment of acute gout, evidence for its benefits and harms is relatively limited.

Objectives

To update the available evidence of the benefits and harms of colchicine for the treatment of acute gout.

Search Methods

We updated the search of CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, Clinicaltrials.gov and WHO ICTRP registries to 28 August 2020. We did not impose any date or language restrictions in the search.

Selection Criteria

We considered published randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomised controlled trials (quasi-RCTs) evaluating colchicine therapy compared with another therapy (placebo or active) in acute gout; low-dose colchicine at clinically relevant doses compared with placebo was the primary comparison. The major outcomes were pain, participant global assessment of treatment success (proportion with 50% or greater decrease in pain from baseline up to 32 to 36 hours), reduction of inflammation, function of target joint, serious adverse events, total adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse events.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures as expected by Cochrane in this review update.

Main Results

We included four trials (803 randomised participants), including two new trials, in this updated review. One three-arm trial compared high-dose colchicine (52 participants), low-dose colchicine (74 participants) and placebo (59 participants); one trial compared high-dose colchicine with placebo (43 participants); one trial compared low-dose colchicine with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (399 participants); and one trial compared low-dose colchicine with Chuanhu anti-gout mixture (traditional Chinese Medicine compound) (176 participants). We did not identify any trials comparing colchicine to glucocorticoids (by any route). The mean age of participants ranged from 51.2 to 70 years, and trial duration from 48 hours to 12 weeks. Two trials were at low risk of bias, one was possibly susceptible to selection bias (random sequence generation), reporting bias and other bias, and one open-label trial was at high risk of performance and detection bias. For the primary comparison, low-quality evidence from one trial (103 participants, downgraded for imprecision and bias) suggests low-dose colchicine may improve treatment outcome compared to placebo with little or no increased risk of adverse events. The number of people who reported treatment success (50% or greater pain reduction) at 32 to 36 hours was slightly larger with low-dose colchicine (418 per 1000) compared with placebo (172 per 1000; risk ratio (RR) 2.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05 to 5.64; absolute improvement 25% more reported success (7% more to 42% more, the 95% CIs include both a clinically important and unimportant benefit); relative change of 143% more people reported treatment success (5% more to 464% more). The incidence of total adverse events was 364 per 1000 with low-dose colchicine compared with 276 per 1000 with placebo: RR 1.32, 95% CI 0.68 to 2.56; absolute difference 9% more events with low-dose colchicine (9% fewer to 43% more, the 95% CIs include both a clinically important effect and no effect); relative change of 32% more events (32% fewer to 156% more). No participants withdrew due to adverse events or reported any serious adverse events. Pain, inflammation and function were not reported. Low-quality evidence (downgraded for imprecision and bias) from two trials (124 participants) suggests that high-dose colchicine compared to placebo may improve symptoms, but with increased risk of harms. More participants reported treatment success at 32 to 36 hours with high-dose colchicine (518 per 1000) compared with placebo (240 per 1000): RR 2.16, 95% CI 1.28 to 3.65, absolute improvement 28% (8% more to 46% more); more also had reduced inflammation at this time point with high-dose colchicine (504 per 1000) compared with placebo (48 per 1000): RR 10.50, 95% CI 1.48 to 74.38; absolute improvement 45% greater (22% greater to 68% greater); but more adverse events were reported with high-dose colchicine (829 per 1000 compared with 260 per 1000): RR 3.21, 95% CI 2.01 to 5.11, absolute difference 57% (26% more to 74% more). Pain and function were not reported. Low-quality evidence from a single trial comparing high-dose to low-dose colchicine indicates there may be little or no difference in benefit in terms of treatment success at 32 to 36 hours but more adverse events associated with the higher dose. Similarly, low-quality evidence from a single trial indicates there may also be little or no benefit of low-dose colchicine over NSAIDs in terms of treatment success and pain reduction at seven days, with a similar number of adverse events reported at four weeks follow-up. Reduction of inflammation, function of target joint and withdrawals due to adverse events were not reported in either of these trials, and pain was not reported in the high-dose versus low-dose colchicine trial. We were unable to estimate the risk of serious adverse events for most comparisons as there were few events reported in the trials. One trial (399 participants) reported three serious adverse (one in a participant receiving low-dose colchicine and two in participants receiving NSAIDs), due to reasons unrelated to the trial (low-quality evidence downgraded for bias and imprecision).

Authors' Conclusions

We found low-quality evidence that low-dose colchicine may be an effective treatment for acute gout when compared to placebo and low-quality evidence that its benefits may be similar to NSAIDs. We downgraded the evidence for bias and imprecision. While both high- and low-dose colchicine improve pain when compared to placebo, low-quality evidence suggests that high-dose (but not low-dose) colchicine may increase the number of adverse events compared to placebo, while low-quality evidence indicates that the number of adverse events may be similar with low-dose colchicine and NSAIDs. Further trials comparing colchicine to placebo or other treatment will likely have an important impact on our confidence in the effect estimates and may change the conclusions of this review. There are no trials reporting the effect of colchicine in populations with comorbidities or in comparison with other commonly used treatments, such as glucocorticoids.

### Hypertension, its treatment, hyperuricaemia and gout [^649608e3]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Gout is increasing worldwide. An appreciation that hyperuricaemia and gout are associated with hypertension and chronic kidney disease is well established, but the cause and effect relationships are controversial. Studies which address this conundrum have been reviewed.

Recent Findings

Epidemiological surveys have confirmed the strong relationship of gout and hyperuricaemia with hypertension and diuretic treatment. There are multiple confounders such as obesity and alcohol consumption which despite adjustments make interpretation of the epidemiology difficult. There are data to suggest that hyperuricaemia itself causes hypertension and renovascular disease, and that lowering of serum urate may assist in control of hypertension. The mechanism for diuretic-induced hyperuricaemia may operate through volume depletion and reduced secretion of uric acid. The latter effect may be genetically influenced.

Summary

Recent population surveys have strongly supported the association of gout and hyperuricaemia with hypertension. The prevailing explanation that renal dysfunction causes both phenomena or that they are caused by shared factors is challenged by the evidence that hyperuricaemia drives hypertension. A confounder of epidemiology studies is the use of diuretics for treating hypertension. A closer understanding of the mechanisms of diuretic-induced hyperuricaemia may lead to the creation of uricosuric diuretics. Losartan is exceptional amongst antihypertensive drugs in possessing mild uricosuric properties and therefore has a role in treating hypertensive patients with gout. Overcoming diuretic-induced hyperuricaemia is difficult and there is need for a uricosuric diuretic.

### Gout: a clinical and radiologic review [^f291ee0f]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

Gout is a group of diseases characterized by arthritis and results from a disturbance of urate metabolism with the deposition of monosodium urate crystals in the joints and soft tissues. Often, but not invariably, the serum urate levels are elevated as a result of overproduction or underexcretion of uric acid. Clinical manifestations include acute and chronic arthritis, tophaceous deposits, interstitial renal disease, and uric acid nephrolithiasis. The diagnosis is based on the identification of uric acid crystals in joints, tissues, or body fluids. Acute episodes are treated with colchicine, NSAIDs, or steroids. Long-term management includes treatment with uricosuric agents or xanthine oxidase inhibitors.

### The clinical benefits of sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 inhibitors in people with gout [^4ceaa228]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Gout is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis worldwide and is characterized by painful recurrent flares of inflammatory arthritis that are associated with a transiently increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Furthermore, gout is associated with multiple cardiometabolic-renal comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease and cardiovascular disease. These comorbidities, potentially combined with gout flare-related inflammation, contribute to persistent premature mortality in gout, independently of serum urate concentrations and traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Although better implementation of standard gout care could improve gout outcomes, deliberate efforts to address the cardiovascular risk in patients with gout are likely to be required to reduce mortality. Sodium-glucose cotransporter type 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are approved for multiple indications owing to their ability to lower the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death, hospitalizations for heart failure and chronic kidney disease progression, making them an attractive treatment option for gout. These medications have also been shown to lower serum urate concentrations, the causal culprit in gout risk, and are associated with a reduced risk of incident and recurrent gout, potentially owing to their purported anti-inflammatory effects. Thus, SGLT2 inhibition could simultaneously address both the symptoms of gout and its comorbidities.
