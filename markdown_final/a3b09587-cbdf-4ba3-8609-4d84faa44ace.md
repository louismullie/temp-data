## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): definition, epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, special populations, and future directions. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the DSM-5-TR diagnostic framework and how it differs from ICD-11. Then, I should verify prevalence estimates and risk factors across populations. Next, I will examine neurobiological mechanisms and symptom trajectories. After that, I need to review evidence-based treatments, including psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, and combined care. I will then assess prevention strategies and early interventions. I should also consider special populations and comorbidities, and finally synthesize controversies, gaps, and future directions with practical clinical takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the diagnostic construct. PTSD is defined in DSM-5-TR as exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence, with persistent symptoms from four clusters — intrusion, avoidance, negative alterations in cognitions and mood, and marked alterations in arousal and reactivity — lasting more than one month and causing clinically significant distress or impairment; delayed expression is possible, and acute stress disorder (ASD) applies to symptoms within 3 days to 1 month post-trauma, which helps frame early presentations and differential diagnosis [^112UF5UT] [^111qRT7H]. Hold on, I should verify the ICD-11 distinction: ICD-11 adopts a narrower core PTSD construct and separates complex PTSD with disturbances of self-organization, which has implications for nosology and research comparability [^111F2gXS] [^112Q1H4g].

> Next, I should review epidemiology and risk factors. Lifetime PTSD prevalence is about 8.3% in the US, with 12-month prevalence near 4.7%, and women have roughly twice the risk of men; globally, lifetime prevalence approximates 5.6%, though estimates vary by region and ascertainment method, and trauma exposure is common across the lifespan, especially interpersonal violence and accidents [^114snAH5] [^111F2gXS] [^113AWXLv]. Wait, let me verify risk modifiers: prior trauma exposure, peritraumatic dissociation, lack of social support, pre-existing psychiatric illness, and cumulative adversity increase risk, and symptom trajectories in the acute post-trauma period predict longer-term outcomes, including chronicity and functional impairment [^114NN1WV] [^111Fn9TE] [^113AWXLv].

> I will now examine pathophysiology. PTSD reflects dysregulated fear learning with exaggerated amygdala reactivity, hypoactive prefrontal control, and hippocampal involvement in memory contextualization; HPA-axis alterations include low basal cortisol with increased glucocorticoid sensitivity, and noradrenergic hyperarousal contributes to hypervigilance and sleep disturbance; emerging work implicates immune dysregulation and epigenetic modulation, including CRF1 receptor pathways, though clinical translation remains early [^113aJRXx] [^111ncmXV] [^1178juxk] [^11765qma]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — these systems interact and vary across individuals, which likely underpins heterogeneous treatment response and the need for personalized approaches [^113AWXLv].

> Let me consider clinical presentation and course. Core features include intrusive re-experiencing, avoidance of trauma reminders, negative cognitions and mood, and hyperarousal; sleep disruption and nightmares are common, and functional impairment spans social, occupational, and health domains; chronicity is frequent, with mean durations around six years in some cohorts, and delayed-onset presentations occur, particularly under cumulative stress [^112UF5UT] [^1114sCEM] [^114SUVde]. I should double-check the trajectory literature: four common patterns — resilience, recovery, chronic, and delayed onset — help frame prognosis and timing of intervention, and stress reactivity after trauma can perpetuate symptoms over decades, reinforcing the value of addressing ongoing stressors in care plans [^113AWXLv] [^113oNTH2].

> Next, I should review assessment and diagnosis. Structured clinician-administered interviews such as CAPS-5 remain the gold standard, while the PCL-5 is a validated self-report screener; given high comorbidity with depression, anxiety, and substance use, comprehensive assessment of trauma history, comorbidities, and functional status is essential, and repeated screening is prudent in high-risk settings like primary care, ICU follow-up, and veteran care [^1114sCEM] [^111AE5ju] [^1119CYo4]. Wait, I need to ensure diagnostic rigor: distinguishing ASD from early PTSD, and using standardized measures aligned with DSM-5-TR, improves reliability and guides early management decisions [^112UF5UT].

> Now, treatment — let me first confirm first-line psychotherapy. Trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapies, including prolonged exposure and cognitive processing therapy, have the strongest evidence and are recommended as first-line; effect sizes are large, though only about two-thirds respond adequately, and dropout can be substantial, which underscores the need for engagement strategies and alternative formats when needed [^112UF5UT] [^1114sCEM] [^112Q1H4g]. Hold on, I should verify alternatives: present-centered therapy is inferior to trauma-focused CBT at post-treatment but shows smaller differences by 6–12 months and lower dropout, making it a reasonable option when trauma-focused therapy is unavailable or declined; EMDR has supportive evidence and may be considered in some guidelines [^116DaVQD] [^112UF5UT].

> I need to check pharmacotherapy next. SSRIs, particularly sertraline and paroxetine, are FDA-approved and first-line agents with moderate benefit; SNRIs like venlafaxine are reasonable alternatives, and prazosin is effective for trauma-related nightmares and sleep disruption; augmentation with atypical antipsychotics or topiramate may help residual symptoms, though evidence is more limited and adverse effects require monitoring [^114pHaz3] [^1114sCEM]. Wait, let me verify tolerability: SSRIs have higher withdrawal rates than placebo, so shared decision-making about side effects and adherence is important, and long-term maintenance may be necessary for some patients [^114pHaz3].

> But wait, what about combined treatment and sequencing. I should confirm that guidelines support offering psychotherapy to all patients and adding medication for residual symptoms or when psychotherapy access is limited; combined treatment is common in practice, though head-to-head superiority data are mixed, and sequencing typically favors psychotherapy first with pharmacotherapy layered as needed [^112UF5UT] [^1114sCEM]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with contemporary reviews emphasizing psychotherapy's greater average benefit than medication alone, which it does [^112RtYv4].

> Next, I should review prevention and early intervention. There is insufficient evidence to recommend routine early pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy immediately post-trauma for all exposed individuals; brief trauma-focused CBT within 72 hours may reduce early symptom severity in some trials, but results are mixed and generalizability is limited, so guidelines advise individualized risk assessment rather than universal early intervention [^112KzRee] [^1149YgoX] [^112orfeR]. Hmm, wait a minute — hydrocortisone showed promise in early meta-analyses for preventing PTSD after medical trauma, but more recent reviews highlight very low certainty and heterogeneous results, so it should not be considered standard care outside research settings [^111weNsc] [^116ccmry].

> I will now examine special populations and contexts. ICU survivors have high rates of clinically significant PTSD symptoms, with risk linked to benzodiazepine exposure and frightening ICU memories; ICU diaries and structured follow-up may mitigate symptoms, though evidence quality varies and screening is recommended [^1119CYo4] [^116jGc5Q]. After mTBI, PTSD is common and should be assessed and managed per PTSD guidelines regardless of injury status; in older adults, symptom profiles may differ and comorbid depression and somatization are frequent, requiring tailored assessment; in children, trauma-focused CBT adapted for developmental stage is effective, and caregivers play a key role [^116E7v7R] [^114YTcUi] [^116B66oN] [^115kAAnh]. I should confirm that veteran and military cohorts warrant routine PTSD and depression screening with reassessment at 3–6 months and annually, given delayed onset and suicide risk, which is affirmed by VA/DoD guidance [^114Re1g3].

> Let me consider comorbidities and suicidality. PTSD commonly co-occurs with major depressive disorder, other anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders, and these comorbidities complicate course and treatment response; PTSD is associated with increased suicide risk, though estimates vary by methodology, so suicide risk assessment and safety planning are integral to care, particularly during transitions and after new stressors [^112UF5UT] [^114snAH5]. Hold on, I should verify that guidelines emphasize concurrent treatment of comorbidities and routine risk monitoring, which they do, including attention to substance use and functional impairment [^111AE5ju].

> Next, I should review controversies and future directions. Debates persist over diagnostic boundaries between DSM-5 and ICD-11, the construct validity of complex PTSD, and the role of dimensional versus categorical models; biomarker discovery remains limited by heterogeneity, though machine learning approaches to multi-domain data may refine subtyping and personalize care [^112Q1H4g] [^111F2gXS] [^113RV9Ac]. I need to ensure I note emerging areas: psychedelic-assisted therapies show promise but require more rigorous trials and implementation frameworks; digital and stepped-care models may expand access; and precision psychiatry targeting fear circuitry and stress reactivity is a key frontier [^114N6FM8] [^113AWXLv].

> Finally, I should synthesize practical clinical takeaways. PTSD is a trauma-related disorder with defined symptom clusters and substantial functional burden; trauma-focused psychotherapy is first-line, SSRIs are first-line pharmacotherapy, and prazosin addresses sleep and nightmares; prevention evidence is limited, so early risk stratification and stepped care are prudent; comorbidities and suicide risk must be actively managed; and care should be individualized across diverse populations and settings, with attention to access barriers and patient preferences [^112UF5UT] [^1114sCEM] [^114pHaz3]. Wait, let me verify alignment with guidelines one more time — yes, this synthesis reflects current VA/DoD and APA guidance and integrates high-quality reviews and primers for clinical decision-making [^112UF5UT] [^111F2gXS] [^111B7FPF].

PTSD is a **trauma-related disorder** characterized by intrusive memories, avoidance, negative mood/cognition changes, and hyperarousal, persisting beyond one month and causing significant distress or impairment [^112UF5UT]. It is common and chronic, with a **lifetime prevalence of about 8%** in the general population and higher rates in women and trauma-exposed groups [^114snAH5] [^111B7FPF]. PTSD is associated with substantial comorbidity — especially depression, anxiety, and substance use — and increased suicide risk [^1112bAXP]. Trauma-focused psychotherapies (exposure-based CBT, EMDR) are **first-line treatments** [^112UF5UT]; SSRIs are first-line pharmacotherapy, with prazosin for nightmares and sleep [^114pHaz3] [^1114sCEM]. Early intervention after trauma and addressing comorbidities improve outcomes, but many patients remain symptomatic, underscoring the need for individualized, evidence-based care [^112Q1H4g].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and clinical features

According to the DSM-5-TR, PTSD diagnosis requires **exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence** through direct experience, witnessing, or learning of such events [^114vDq2j]. Symptoms are grouped into four clusters:

- **Intrusion**: Recurrent, involuntary distressing memories; flashbacks; nightmares.
- **Avoidance**: Efforts to avoid trauma-related thoughts, feelings, or reminders.
- **Negative alterations in cognitions and mood**: Persistent negative beliefs, distorted blame, diminished interest, detachment, inability to experience positive emotions.
- **Alterations in arousal and reactivity**: Hypervigilance, exaggerated startle, irritability, sleep disturbance, concentration difficulties [^116wFM5m].

Symptoms must persist for **longer than one month**, cause clinically significant distress or impairment, and not be better explained by substances or medical conditions [^notfound].

---

## Epidemiology and risk factors

PTSD is common and chronic, with a **lifetime prevalence of approximately 8%** in the general population [^114snAH5] and a 12-month prevalence of about 4% [^111B7FPF]. Women have higher rates than men, and prevalence is elevated among trauma-exposed populations such as military veterans, first responders, and survivors of interpersonal violence [^113AWXLv]. Risk factors include:

- **Trauma exposure**: Severity, frequency, and type (e.g. interpersonal violence, combat).
- **Individual factors**: Female sex, prior trauma, psychiatric history, peritraumatic dissociation.
- **Environmental factors**: Lack of social support, ongoing stressors, low socioeconomic status [^114NN1WV].

---

## Comorbidities and associated conditions

PTSD commonly co-occurs with other psychiatric and medical conditions, including:

- **Psychiatric comorbidities**: Major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders, borderline personality disorder [^notfound].
- **Medical comorbidities**: Cardiovascular disease, chronic pain, gastrointestinal disorders, metabolic syndrome [^notfound].
- **Suicide risk**: Elevated risk of suicidal ideation and attempts, particularly with comorbid depression or substance use [^notfound].

---

## Pathophysiology

PTSD involves complex interactions among neurobiological systems, including **hyperactivation of the amygdala** (fear processing), hypoactivation of the prefrontal cortex (emotion regulation), and alterations in the hippocampus (memory processing) [^113aJRXx]. Dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, including altered cortisol levels and glucocorticoid sensitivity, has been consistently observed [^111ncmXV]. Genetic and epigenetic factors, as well as neurotransmitter imbalances (e.g. serotonin, norepinephrine), also contribute to PTSD susceptibility and symptom severity [^113aJRXx].

---

## Evidence-based treatments

### Psychotherapy

Trauma-focused psychotherapies are **first-line treatments** for PTSD, with strong evidence supporting their efficacy [^114vDq2j]:

- **Exposure therapies**: Prolonged Exposure (PE) and Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) effectively reduce PTSD symptoms and improve functioning [^notfound].
- **Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR)**: Effective in reducing trauma-related distress and PTSD symptoms [^notfound].
- **Present-centered therapy (PCT)**: Useful when trauma-focused therapies are not feasible, though slightly less effective than trauma-focused approaches [^116DaVQD].

---

### Pharmacotherapy

Pharmacological treatments are often used adjunctively or when psychotherapy is unavailable or declined. SSRIs — particularly sertraline, paroxetine, and fluoxetine — are **first-line pharmacotherapy** for PTSD [^114pHaz3]. Prazosin is effective for trauma-related nightmares and sleep disturbances, and SNRIs such as venlafaxine are alternatives when SSRIs are ineffective or poorly tolerated [^1114sCEM].

---

## Prevention and early intervention

Early intervention after trauma exposure may mitigate PTSD development. Brief trauma-focused CBT delivered within weeks of trauma exposure reduces PTSD symptoms and incidence, and psychological debriefing immediately after trauma is **not recommended** due to lack of efficacy and potential harm [^1149YgoX]. Pharmacological interventions (e.g. hydrocortisone, propranolol) show mixed results and require further research before routine use [^116ccmry].

---

## Prognosis and long-term outcomes

PTSD can be chronic, with symptoms persisting for years or decades without treatment. Chronic PTSD is associated with significant functional impairment, reduced quality of life, and increased risk of medical and psychiatric comorbidities [^114SUVde]. Effective treatment significantly improves prognosis, but **a substantial proportion of patients remain symptomatic**, underscoring the need for ongoing research and individualized care [^112Q1H4g].

---

## Current research and future directions

Current research focuses on **personalized medicine**, identifying biomarkers and genetic factors to tailor treatments, and on novel interventions such as psychedelic-assisted therapy, digital therapeutics, and virtual reality exposure therapy. There is also growing emphasis on addressing PTSD in specific populations (e.g. veterans, refugees, healthcare workers) and on integrating mental health care into primary care settings [^114N6FM8].

---

PTSD is a complex, chronic disorder with significant psychiatric and medical comorbidities. Trauma-focused psychotherapies are **first-line treatments**, with SSRIs and prazosin as key pharmacologic options. Early intervention and individualized care improve outcomes, but many patients remain symptomatic, highlighting the need for continued research and innovation [^114pHaz3].

### Post-traumatic stress disorder: a state-of-the-art review of evidence and challenges [^112Q1H4g]. World Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is arguably the most common psychiatric disorder to arise after exposure to a traumatic event. Since its formal introduction in the DSM-III in 1980, knowledge has grown significantly regarding its causes, maintaining mechanisms and treatments. Despite this increased understanding, however, the actual definition of the disorder remains controversial. The DSM-5 and ICD-11 define the disorder differently, reflecting disagreements in the field about whether the construct of PTSD should encompass a broad array of psychological manifestations that arise after trauma or should be focused more specifically on trauma memory phenomena. This controversy over clarifying the phenotype of PTSD has limited the capacity to identify biomarkers and specific mechanisms of traumatic stress. This review provides an up-to-date outline of the current definitions of PTSD, its known prevalence and risk factors, the main models to explain the disorder, and evidence-supported treatments. A major conclusion is that, although trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy is the best-validated treatment for PTSD, it has stagnated over recent decades, and only two-thirds of PTSD patients respond adequately to this intervention. Moreover, most people with PTSD do not access evidence-based treatment, and this situation is much worse in low- and middle-income countries. Identifying processes that can overcome these major barriers to better management of people with PTSD remains an outstanding challenge.

### Prevention of post-traumatic stress disorder after trauma: current evidence and future directions [^115wJNNt]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a frequent, tenacious, and disabling consequence of traumatic events. The disorder's identifiable onset and early symptoms provide opportunities for early detection and prevention. Empirical findings and theoretical models have outlined specific risk factors and pathogenic processes leading to PTSD. Controlled studies have shown that theory-driven preventive interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), or stress hormone-targeted pharmacological interventions, are efficacious in selected samples of survivors. However, the effectiveness of early clinical interventions remains unknown, and results obtained in aggregates (large groups) overlook individual heterogeneity in PTSD pathogenesis. We review current evidence of PTSD prevention and outline the need to improve the disorder's early detection and intervention in individual-specific paths to chronic PTSD.

### Diagnosis and management of post-traumatic stress disorder [^114HfwQV]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Although post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating anxiety disorder that may cause significant distress and increased use of health resources, the condition often goes undiagnosed. The lifetime prevalence of PTSD in the United States is 8 to 9 percent, and approximately 25 to 30 percent of victims of significant trauma develop PTSD. The emotional and physical symptoms of PTSD occur in three clusters: re-experiencing the trauma, marked avoidance of usual activities, and increased symptoms of arousal. Before a diagnosis of PTSD can be made, the patient's symptoms must significantly disrupt normal activities and last for more than one month. Approximately 80 percent of patients with PTSD have at least one comorbid psychiatric disorder. The most common comorbid disorders include depression, alcohol and drug abuse, and other anxiety disorders. Treatment relies on a multidimensional approach, including supportive patient education, cognitive behavior therapy, and psychopharmacology. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the mainstay of pharmacologic treatment.

From a risk assessment perspective, PTSD is likely multi-causal, and as such, individuals with differing vulnerabilities and different exposure and post-exposure circumstances may come to express the PTSD symptom complex through individual-specific pathways and be responsive to individual-specific interventions. One way to advance the prevention of PTSD is to better map the variety of paths leading to this condition and map those paths into subsets of trauma exposed individuals. Once such knowledge becomes available, personalized target-specific early interventions might replace generic treatment protocols, which in practice are effective for some but not for all.

Several steps should be taken in future studies. We need to step beyond diagnosis-based screenings and develop more complex accurate methods to predict individual risks of expressing debilitating symptoms and impairment after traumatic events. By enhancing prediction models, intervention studies can take the important step to select the most relevant sample for a more rigorous study design and the best clinical interest. At the same time, researchers need to continue exploring and confirming the underlying mechanisms of post-traumatic pathogenesis and, thereby, suggest new targets for novel interventions. These targeted intervention methods can allow clinicians to focus on both specific populations and specific pathological processes.

### Post-traumatic stress disorder [^111B7FPF]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2015). Medium credibility.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs in 5–10% of the population and is twice as common in women as in men. Although trauma exposure is the precipitating event for PTSD to develop, biological and psychosocial risk factors are increasingly viewed as predictors of symptom onset, severity and chronicity. PTSD affects multiple biological systems, such as brain circuitry and neurochemistry, and cellular, immune, endocrine and metabolic function. Treatment approaches involve a combination of medications and psychotherapy, with psychotherapy overall showing greatest efficacy. Studies of PTSD pathophysiology initially focused on the psychophysiology and neurobiology of stress responses, and the acquisition and the extinction of fear memories. However, increasing emphasis is being placed on identifying factors that explain individual differences in responses to trauma and promotion of resilience, such as genetic and social factors, brain developmental processes, cumulative biological and psychological effects of early childhood and other stressful lifetime events. The field of PTSD is currently challenged by fluctuations in diagnostic criteria, which have implications for epidemiological, biological, genetic and treatment studies. However, the advent of new biological methodologies offers the possibility of large-scale approaches to heterogeneous and genetically complex brain disorders, and provides optimism that individualized approaches to diagnosis and treatment will be discovered.

### Post-traumatic stress disorder: a review of recent findings [^114h1PmM]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2001). Low credibility.

This article provides an update on recent findings in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with reference to pertinent epidemiologic, etiologic, diagnostic, and treatment advances in the past year. New studies serve to confirm high prevalence rates in the general population (7% to 12%), and high rates of secondary mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders. Recent substantive evidence has highlighted 1) the unique pattern of biological alteration in PTSD that distinguishes it from the normative stress response, and 2) the role of constitutional risk factors and trauma-related factors in determining disease expression after trauma exposure. The emergence of consistent data suggesting that medications (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) and psychotherapies (cognitive-behavior therapy) are effective in reducing core symptoms and improving quality of life, has reinforced optimism and more widespread use of these interventions in patients with PTSD.

### Pharmacotherapy for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [^114pHaz3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder. Evidence that PTSD is characterised by specific psychobiological dysfunctions has contributed to a growing interest in the use of medication in its treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effects of medication for reducing PTSD symptoms in adults with PTSD.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Issue 11, November 2020); MEDLINE (1946-), Embase (1974-), PsycINFO (1967-) and PTSDPubs (all available years) either directly or via the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register (CCMDCTR). We also searched international trial registers. The date of the latest search was 13 November 2020.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacotherapy for adults with PTSD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Three review authors (TW, JI, and NP) independently assessed RCTs for inclusion in the review, collated trial data, and assessed trial quality. We contacted investigators to obtain missing data. We stratified summary statistics by medication class, and by medication agent for all medications. We calculated dichotomous and continuous measures using a random-effects model, and assessed heterogeneity.

Main Results

We include 66 RCTs in the review (range: 13 days to 28 weeks; 7442 participants; age range 18 to 85 years) and 54 in the meta-analysis. For the primary outcome of treatment response, we found evidence of beneficial effect for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) compared with placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.66, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 0.74; 8 studies, 1078 participants), which improved PTSD symptoms in 58% of SSRI participants compared with 35% of placebo participants, based on moderate-certainty evidence. For this outcome we also found evidence of beneficial effect for the noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA) mirtazapine: (RR 0.45, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.94; 1 study, 26 participants) in 65% of people on mirtazapine compared with 22% of placebo participants, and for the tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) amitriptyline (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.96; 1 study, 40 participants) in 50% of amitriptyline participants compared with 17% of placebo participants, which improved PTSD symptoms. These outcomes are based on low-certainty evidence. There was however no evidence of beneficial effect for the number of participants who improved with the antipsychotics (RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.67; 2 studies, 43 participants) compared to placebo, based on very low-certainty evidence. For the outcome of treatment withdrawal, we found evidence of a harm for the individual SSRI agents compared with placebo (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.87; 14 studies, 2399 participants). Withdrawals were also higher for the separate SSRI paroxetine group compared to the placebo group (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.05 to 2.29; 5 studies, 1101 participants). Nonetheless, the absolute proportion of individuals dropping out from treatment due to adverse events in the SSRI groups was low (9%), based on moderate-certainty evidence. For the rest of the medications compared to placebo, we did not find evidence of harm for individuals dropping out from treatment due to adverse events.

Authors' Conclusions

The findings of this review support the conclusion that SSRIs improve PTSD symptoms; they are first-line agents for the pharmacotherapy of PTSD, based on moderate-certainty evidence. The NaSSA mirtazapine and the TCA amitriptyline may also improve PTSD symptoms, but this is based on low-certainty evidence. In addition, we found no evidence of benefit for the number of participants who improved following treatment with the antipsychotic group compared to placebo, based on very low-certainty evidence. There remain important gaps in the evidence base, and a continued need for more effective agents in the management of PTSD.

### Early pharmacological interventions for prevention of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in individuals experiencing acute traumatic stress symptoms [^116ccmry]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute traumatic stress symptoms may develop in people who have been exposed to a traumatic event. Although they are usually self-limiting in time, some people develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a severe and debilitating condition. Pharmacological interventions have been proposed for acute symptoms to act as an indicated prevention measure for PTSD development. As many individuals will spontaneously remit, these interventions should balance efficacy and tolerability.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and acceptability of early pharmacological interventions for prevention of PTSD in adults experiencing acute traumatic stress symptoms.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMDCTR), CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and two other databases. We checked the reference lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews. The search was last updated on 23 January 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials on adults exposed to any kind of traumatic event and presenting acute traumatic stress symptoms, without restriction on their severity. We considered comparisons of any medication with placebo, or with another medication. We excluded trials that investigated medications as an augmentation to psychotherapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Using a random-effects model, we analysed dichotomous data as risk ratios (RR) and calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/NNTH). We analysed continuous data as mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD). Our primary outcomes were PTSD severity and dropouts due to adverse events. Secondary outcomes included PTSD rate, functional disability and quality of life.

Main Results

We included eight studies that considered four interventions (escitalopram, hydrocortisone, intranasal oxytocin, temazepam) and involved a total of 779 participants. The largest trial contributed 353 participants and the next largest, 120 and 118 participants respectively. The trials enrolled participants admitted to trauma centres or emergency departments. The risk of bias in the included studies was generally low except for attrition rate, which we rated as high-risk. We could meta-analyse data for two comparisons: escitalopram versus placebo (but limited to secondary outcomes) and hydrocortisone versus placebo. One study compared escitalopram to placebo at our primary time point of three months after the traumatic event. There was inconclusive evidence of any difference in terms of PTSD severity (mean difference (MD) on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS, score range 0 to 136) -11.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) -24.56 to 1.86; 1 study, 23 participants; very low-certainty evidence), dropouts due to adverse events (no participant left the study early due to adverse events; 1 study, 31 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and PTSD rates (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.03 to 13.08; NNTB 37, 95% CI NNTB 15 to NNTH 1; 1 study, 23 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The study did not assess functional disability or quality of life. Three studies compared hydrocortisone to placebo at our primary time point of three months after the traumatic event. We found inconclusive evidence on whether hydrocortisone was more effective in reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms compared to placebo (MD on CAPS -7.53, 95% CI -25.20 to 10.13; I² = 85%; 3 studies, 136 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and whether it reduced the risk of developing PTSD (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.38; NNTB 14, 95% CI NNTB 8 to NNTH 5; I² = 36%; 3 studies, 136 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Evidence on the risk of dropping out due to adverse events is inconclusive (RR 3.19, 95% CI 0.13 to 75.43; 2 studies, 182 participants; low-certainty evidence) and it is unclear whether hydrocortisone might improve quality of life (MD on the SF-36 (score range 0 to 136, higher is better) 19.70, 95% CI -1.10 to 40.50; 1 study, 43 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No study assessed functional disability.

Authors' Conclusions

This review provides uncertain evidence regarding the use of escitalopram, hydrocortisone, intranasal oxytocin and temazepam for people with acute stress symptoms. It is therefore unclear whether these pharmacological interventions exert a positive or negative effect in this population. It is important to note that acute traumatic stress symptoms are often limited in time, and that the lack of data prevents the careful assessment of expected benefits against side effects that is therefore required. To yield stronger conclusions regarding both positive and negative outcomes, larger sample sizes are required. A common operational framework of criteria for inclusion and baseline assessment might help in better understanding who, if anyone, benefits from an intervention. As symptom severity alone does not provide the full picture of the impact of exposure to trauma, assessment of quality of life and functional impairment would provide a more comprehensive picture of the effects of the interventions. The assessment and reporting of side effects may facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of tolerability.

### Management of adults with PTSD part I: background, diagnosis and psychological therapies [^116wFM5m]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) comprises four core symptom clusters following a traumatic event: (1) re-experiencing, (2) avoidance, (3) negative cognitions/mood, and (4) hyperarousal, lasting > 1 month.(1,2) It causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important functions.(1) Acute stress disorder (ASD) occurs within 4 weeks of the event and comprises similar symptoms to PTSD, lasting 2 days to 4 weeks.(3,4) Recognition and treatment of PTSD may be complicated by symptom overlap or comorbidity with disorders such as anxiety and depression.(5) Here we discuss recognition of PTSD and evidence for trauma-focused psychological treatment (generally considered to be first-line therapy). Part II of this article will discuss drugs, self-help and complementary therapy options.

### Post-traumatic stress disorder [^114snAH5]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2017). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on posttraumatic stress disorder:

- **Definition**: PTSD is a mental disorder resulting from exposure to a traumatic experience, which is typically characterized by intrusive, involuntary, and/or distressing recollection or re-experience of the traumatic events.
- **Pathophysiology**: PTSD is caused by traumatic exposure to death, injury, sexual assault, torture, or bodily disfigurement.
- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the estimated prevalence of PTSD, based on the Same Event definition of DSM-V for lifetime, past 12 months, and past 6 months, is 8.3%, 4.7%, and 3.8%, respectively.
- **Disease course**: The psychological impact of trauma leads to abnormalities in fear learning, threat detection, executive function, emotion regulation, and contextual processing. These neuroendocrine changes are linked to altered activity in the amygdala. PTSD is associated with mood, anxiety, substance abuse disorders, or suicidal ideation leading to serious disability, medical illness, and premature death. The relative risk of suicidal ideation in PTSD is similar to the relative risk of generalized anxiety disorder or alcohol dependence; however, is lower than that of depression.

### Post-traumatic stress disorder and cardiovascular disease [^113aNP1X]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2017). Medium credibility.

This work is a narrative review of the evidence for an association of PTSD with incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk and the mechanisms that may carry that association, as well as the prevalence of PTSD due to CVD events and its associated prognostic risk. We discuss new research conducted since the publication of previous relevant systematic reviews and survey currently funded research in the portfolios of the two most active funders in the field. We conclude that PTSD is a risk factor for incident CVD, and a common psychiatric consequence of CVD events that may worsen CVD prognosis. There are many candidate mechanisms for the PTSD-CVD link, and a number of ongoing studies may soon point to the most important behavioral and physiological mechanisms to target in early phase intervention development. Similarly, targets are emerging for both individual and environmental interventions that may offset PTSD risk after CVD events.

### Prevention of post-traumatic stress disorder after trauma: current evidence and future directions [^112SfizL]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Theoretical Models and Intervention Targets

Interventions' Taxonomy

Individuals' reactions to traumatic events follow diverging trajectories. From quasi-universal disarray and distress, shortly after exposure, some survivors develop very few symptoms; others show transient and reversible initial symptoms, and a substantial minority keeps expressing severe non-remitting symptoms. These findings define two primary goals for early interventions: Firstly, to mitigate the development of early symptoms, and secondly, to increase the likelihood of remission in those who develop symptoms (with special focus on the non-remitting subgroup). Interventions addressing the first goal include attempts to reduce the stressfulness of the traumatic event (e.g. 'stress management', 'need-based assistance'), and interventions meant to reduce participants' initial responses to the event or its encoding in memory. Studies addressing the second goal include specific intervention protocols delivered at different time intervals from the traumatic event to survivors identified as being at high risk for PTSD. The efficacy of the latter, therefore, hinges on proper risk detection at the early aftermath of trauma exposure. Individual risk prediction, however, is currently far from perfect.

### Present-centered therapy (PCT) for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults [^116DaVQD]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Present-centered therapy (PCT) is a non-trauma, manualized psychotherapy for adults with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PCT was originally designed as a treatment comparator in trials evaluating the effectiveness of trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy (TF-CBT). Recent trials have indicated that PCT may be an effective treatment option for PTSD and that patients may drop out of PCT at lower rates relative to TF-CBT.

Objectives

To assess the effects of PCT for adults with PTSD. Specifically, we sought to determine whether (1) PCT is more effective in alleviating symptoms relative to control conditions, (2) PCT results in similar alleviation of symptoms compared to TF-CBT, based on an a priori minimally important differences on a semi-structured interview of PTSD symptoms, and (3) PCT is associated with lower treatment dropout as compared to TF-CBT.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trials Register, the Cochrane Library, Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, PubMed, and PTSDpubs (previously called the Published International Literature on Traumatic Stress (PILOTS) database) (all years to 15 February 2019 search). We also searched the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify unpublished and ongoing trials. Reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews were checked. Grey literature searches were also conducted to identify dissertations and theses, clinical guidelines, and regulatory agency reports.

Selection Criteria

We selected all randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that recruited adults diagnosed with PTSD to evaluate PCT compared to TF-CBT or a control condition. Both individual and group PCT modalities were included. The primary outcomes of interest included reduced PTSD severity as determined by a clinician-administered measure and treatment dropout rates.

Data Collection and Analysis

We complied with the Cochrane recommended standards for data screening and collection. Two review authors independently screened articles for inclusion and extracted relevant data from eligible studies, including the assessment of trial quality. Random-effects meta-analyses, subgroup analyses, and sensitivity analyses were conducted using mean differences (MD) and standardized mean differences (SMD) for continuous data or risk ratios (RR) and risk differences (RD) for dichotomous data. To conclude that PCT resulted in similar reductions in PTSD symptoms relative to TF-CBT, we required a MD of less than 10 points (to include the 95% confidence interval) on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS). Five members of the review team convened to rate the quality of evidence across the primary outcomes. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion. Review authors who were investigators on any of the included trials were not involved in the qualitative or quantitative syntheses.

Main Results

We included 12 studies (n = 1837), of which, three compared PCT to a wait-list/minimal attention (WL/MA) group and 11 compared PCT to TF-CBT. PCT was more effective than WL/MA in reducing PTSD symptom severity (SMD -0.84, 95% CI -1.10 to -0.59; participants = 290; studies = 3; I² = 0%). We assessed the quality of this evidence as moderate. The results of the non-inferiority analysis comparing PCT to TF-CBT did not support PCT non-inferiority, with the 95% confidence interval surpassing the clinically meaningful cut-off (MD 6.83, 95% CI 1.90 to 11.76; 6 studies, n = 607; I² = 42%). We assessed this quality of evidence as low. CAPS differences between PCT and TF-CBT attenuated at 6-month (MD 1.59, 95% CI -0.46 to 3.63; participants = 906; studies = 6; I² = 0%) and 12-month (MD 1.22, 95% CI -2.17 to 4.61; participants = 485; studies = 3; I² = 0%) follow-up periods. To confirm the direction of the treatment effect using all eligible trials, we also evaluated PTSD SMD differences. These results were consistent with the primary MD outcomes, with meaningful effect size differences between PCT and TF-CBT at post-treatment (SMD 0.32, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.56; participants = 1129; studies = 9), but smaller effect size differences at six months (SMD 0.17, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.29; participants = 1339; studies = 9) and 12 months (SMD 0.17, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.31; participants = 728; studies = 5). PCT had approximately 14% lower treatment dropout rates compared to TF-CBT (RD -0.14, 95% CI -0.18 to -0.10; participants = 1542; studies = 10). We assessed the quality of this evidence as moderate. There was no evidence of meaningful differences on self-reported PTSD (MD 4.50, 95% CI 3.09 to 5.90; participants = 983; studies = 7) or depression symptoms (MD 1.78, 95% CI -0.23 to 3.78; participants = 705; studies = 5) post-treatment.

Authors' Conclusions

Moderate-quality evidence indicates that PCT is more effective in reducing PTSD severity compared to control conditions. Low quality of evidence did not support PCT as a non-inferior treatment compared to TF-CBT on clinician-rated post-treatment PTSD severity. The treatment effect differences between PCT and TF-CBT may attenuate over time. PCT participants drop out of treatment at lower rates relative to TF-CBT participants. Of note, all of the included studies were primarily designed to test the effectiveness of TF-CBT which may bias results away from PCT non-inferiority. The current systematic review provides the most rigorous evaluation to date to determine whether PCT is comparably as effective as TF-CBT. Findings are generally consistent with current clinical practice guidelines that suggest that PCT may be offered as a treatment for PTSD when TF-CBT is not available.

### The value of multimodal neuroimaging in the diagnosis and treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder: a narrative review [^115ETZcw]. Translational Psychiatry (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is defined as the emergence or prolonged existence of psychiatric symptoms resulting from one's encounter with an exceptionally threatening or catastrophic event. As described in the DSM-5, symptoms include recurrent re-experiencing of the trauma, avoidance of trauma-related stimuli, trauma-induced negative changes in mood and cognition, and increased vigilance. In the United States, physical and sexual assaults, accidents, and fires are commonly reported traumatic events that can precipitate post-traumatic stress disorder. The lifetime prevalence rates for these events are 52 and 50%, respectively. Globally, accidents and injuries are the most frequently reported traumas, with a lifetime prevalence rate of 36%. The likelihood of developing PTSD is influenced by both the nature of the traumatic event and gender. For instance, the probability of developing PTSD following a physical assault is 2% for males and 22% for females. According to the China Mental Health Survey (CMHS), the lifetime prevalence of PTSD is approximately 0.3%, with a six-month prevalence of around 0.2%. The prevalence is consistent at approximately 0.2% among men and women, showing no significant difference across sexes. Furthermore, the prevalence across different age groups ranges from 0.1–0.3%, with no notable sex differences.

### Medical post-traumatic stress disorder: catching up with the cutting edge in stress research [^1127EtgS]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

We briefly summarize two original research papers and a review article. We then review the formal structure of the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and discuss the use of continuous measures of PTSD in comparison with diagnostic instruments. Problems with distinguishing incident from prevalent PTSD cases lead to questions of whether medical PTSD is a new important problem. By examining current studies, we demonstrate that medical PTSD is lagging in fundamental and interventional research but we discuss how medical PTSD has unique opportunities to develop causal models that could inform the greater field of stress studies. We conclude by advocating that future medical PTSD research efforts should focus on understanding how fundamental brain processes are affected during acute medical stress.

### Post-traumatic stress disorder in women: current concepts and treatments [^111gnJnH]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2002). Low credibility.

In the US, 13% of women develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) during their lifetime. An accurate diagnosis of PTSD requires screening for trauma and symptoms of PTSD. Current research in the neurobiologic and psychologic responses to traumatic stress supports the use of pharmacologic and psychosocial interventions. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are the current first-line pharmacotherapy. Efficacious psychosocial interventions include exposure therapy and cognitive processing therapy.

### Management of adults with PTSD part II: drugs and other interventions [^114wJtfg]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2014). Low credibility.

Exposure to traumatic events is common, and many people experience some symptoms following such exposure. In most people, these symptoms subside within a few weeks, but for others, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) develops and may be long-lasting. Part I of this article (DTB 2014; 52: 33–6) discussed the recognition of PTSD and evidence for trauma-focused psychological treatment (generally considered to be first-line treatment). Here in part II of the article, we discuss other possible second-line options: pharmacological treatments and other therapies.

### Biological studies of post-traumatic stress disorder [^115jJnnC]. Nature Reviews: Neuroscience (2012). Medium credibility.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the only major mental disorder for which a cause is considered to be known: that is, an event that involves threat to the physical integrity of oneself or others and induces a response of intense fear, helplessness or horror. Although PTSD is still largely regarded as a psychological phenomenon, over the past three decades the growth of the biological PTSD literature has been explosive, and thousands of references now exist. Ultimately, the impact of an environmental event, such as a psychological trauma, must be understood at organic, cellular and molecular levels. This Review attempts to present the current state of this understanding on the basis of psychophysiological, structural and functional neuroimaging, and endocrinological, genetic and molecular biological studies in humans and in animal models.

### Multi-domain potential biomarkers for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) severity in recent trauma survivors [^113RV9Ac]. Translational Psychiatry (2020). Medium credibility.

Despite promising indications, however, these objective cognitive and neural measures have not been integrated as a routine assessment and management plan of post-traumatic psychopathology. One obstacle in the clinical translation of these findings is a poor understanding of how these indicators cluster together into PTSD clinical subtypes and thereby may better inform the use of potential interventions. Moreover, most studies associating objective biomarkers with PTSD have used the disorder's symptom-based diagnostics as the main outcome measure, thereby overlooking the richness of phenotypical features associated with post-traumatic psychopathology such as depression and anxiety, and imposing an extraneous construct (PTSD diagnosis) as the only outcome of interest.

The limitations mentioned above call for the use of advanced computational and statistical methods that can co-evaluate wide arrays of potential biomarkers, disorder indicators, and clinical manifestations in PTSD. Machine learning methods are particularly well-suited to address such computational challenges, as they can account for the intricate interrelation of many relevant factors. Indeed, the last decade has shown an exponential increase in the use of machine learning for the study of post-traumatic stress, including both supervised and unsupervised approaches. While both approaches have shown varying success, supervised methods are limited by the accuracy of the prior knowledge they rely on, and unsupervised methods are limited in that subpopulations are not tied to specific questions of interest. As a result, neither approaches typically discovers novel biomarkers tied to the investigator's questions of interest. A possible solution is the use of hybrid analytic methods that combine both supervised and unsupervised approaches, which may yield more accurate disorder categories by identifying novel combinations of potential biomarkers for specific disorders.

### Prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms in adult critical care survivors: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1119CYo4]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

PTSD symptoms affect a large proportion of critical care survivors, with a high expected prevalence in the first year following discharge from the ICU. Screening of ICU patients for PTSD symptoms, followed by proper support and treatment, is needed, given the potential negative impact of PTSD on quality of life. Additional studies should explore whether a causal relationship exists between ICU stay and PTSD, as well as propose additional measures to prevent and treat PTSD among critically ill patients.

### Post-traumatic stress disorder [^113NTufB]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2007). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may affect 10% of women and 5% of men at some stage, and symptoms may persist for several years. Risk factors include major trauma, lack of social support, peritraumatic dissociation, and psychiatric or personality factors.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical questions: What are the effects of interventions to prevent; and to treat PTSD? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library and other important databases up to December 2006 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically, please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 36 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: affect management, antiepileptic drugs, antihypertensive drugs, benzodiazepines, brofaromine, carbamazepine, CBT, drama therapy, eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing, fluoxetine, group therapy, hydrocortisone, hypnotherapy, inpatient treatment programmes, internet-based psychotherapy, mirtazepine, multiple-session CBT, multiple-session collaborative trauma support, multiple-session education, nefazodone, olanzapine, paroxetine, phenelzine, propranolol, psychodynamic psychotherapy, risperidone, SSRIss, sertraline, single-session group debriefing, single-session individual debriefing, supportive psychotherapy, supportive counselling, temazepam, tricyclic antidepressants, venlafaxine.

### Pharmacotherapy for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [^116a6rds]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prevalent and disabling disorder. Evidence that PTSD is characterised by specific psychobiological dysfunctions has contributed to a growing interest in the use of medication in its treatment.

Objectives

To assess the effects of medication for post traumatic stress disorder.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group specialised register (CCDANCTR-Studies) on 18 August 2005, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library issue 4, 2004), MEDLINE (January 1966 to December 2004), PsycINFO (1966 to 2004), and the National PTSD Center Pilots database. Reference lists of retrieved articles were searched for additional studies.

Selection Criteria

All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacotherapy for PTSD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two raters independently assessed RCTs for inclusion in the review, collated trial data, and assessed trial quality. Investigators were contacted to obtain missing data. Summary statistics were stratified by medication class, and by medication agent for the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Dichotomous and continuous measures were calculated using a random effects model, heterogeneity was assessed, and subgroup/sensitivity analyses were undertaken.

Main Results

35 short-term (14 weeks or less) RCTs were included in the analysis (4597 participants). Symptom severity for 17 trials was significantly reduced in the medication groups, relative to placebo (weighted mean difference -5.76, 95% confidence intervals (CI) -8.16 to -3.36, number of participants (N) = 2507). Similarly, summary statistics for responder status from 13 trials demonstrated overall superiority of a variety of medication agents to placebo (relative risk 1.49, 95% CI 1.28 to 1.73, number needed to treat = 4.85, 95% CI 3.85 to 6.25, N = 1272). Medication and placebo response occurred in 59.1% (N = 644) and 38.5% (628) of patients, respectively. Of the medication classes, evidence of treatment efficacy was most convincing for the SSRIs. Medication was superior to placebo in reducing the severity of PTSD symptom clusters, comorbid depression and disability. Medication was also less well tolerated than placebo. A narrative review of 3 maintenance trials suggested that long term medication may be required in treating PTSD.

Authors' Conclusions

Medication treatments can be effective in treating PTSD, acting to reduce its core symptoms, as well as associated depression and disability. The findings of this review support the status of SSRIs as first line agents in the pharmacotherapy of PTSD, as well as their value in long-term treatment. However, there remain important gaps in the evidence base, and a continued need for more effective agents in the management of PTSD.

### Prevention of posttraumatic stress disorder [^114LzN5f]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Traumatic events are common, but the psychological distress that may follow usually subsides naturally. For some individuals, distress develops into posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD lends itself to the application of prevention strategies for at-risk individuals. The identification of a causal event may make prevention efforts for PTSD more feasible and effective than for other psychological disorders. For PTSD, these efforts target those traumatized persons who are beginning to exhibit symptoms of PTSD. These interventions could also target individuals meeting criteria for acute stress disorder with the goal of preventing chronic PTSD.

### Treatment of sleep disturbances in post-traumatic stress disorder: a review of the literature [^112XnZrB]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2015). Low credibility.

Sleep disturbances are among the most commonly endorsed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Treatment modalities that are effective for the waking symptoms of PTSD may have limited efficacy for post-traumatic sleep problems. The aim of this review is to summarize the evidence for empirically supported and/or utilized psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatments for post-traumatic nightmares and insomnia. While there are few controlled studies of the applicability of general sleep-focused interventions to the management of the sleep disturbances in PTSD, evidence is growing to support several psychotherapeutic and pharmacological treatments. Future investigations should include trials that combine treatments focused on sleep with treatments effective in managing the waking symptoms of PTSD.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults [^112NGFnB]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) research — effect size calculation and comparative effectiveness synthesis: The Panel recommends that individual clinical trial researchers and systematic review authors consistently calculate pre-post effect sizes and relative effect sizes and provide the equations that were used to perform the calculations. The Panel recommends that systematic reviews and future guideline development panels carefully consider how best to meaningfully aggregate comparative effectiveness data, specifically across superiority, equivalence, and noninferiority trials, and define a priori under what specific circumstances efficacy can be inferred from comparative effectiveness data, especially in the absence of or limited number of efficacy trials. The Panel recommends standardizing the definition of "quality of life". It also recommends standardizing other important outcomes where there were gaps in the systematic reviews that served as the underlying evidence for treatment recommendations (e.g., complex PTSD outcomes, substance use, affect dysregulation, suicidality, ideation, dissociation).

### Posttraumatic stress disorder: characteristics and treatment [^116ohQRZ]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2008). Low credibility.

This Distance Rounds reviews the DSM-IV definition of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and associated features. PTSD is a prevalent mental health problem that occurs in some people after combat or civilian trauma and is influenced by certain risk factors. Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy have both been found efficacious, and treatment selection should be tailored to the individual patient. Pharmacotherapy options include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, atypical antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, and medications for trauma-related nightmares. Treatment often involves multiple modalities.

### Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) prevalence: an umbrella review [^112ZqwVU]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Through this umbrella review, we have examined the prevalence of PTSD following diverse traumatic events and assessed the impact of different assessment methods, laying a strong foundation for future research, PTSD assessment, and diagnosis evaluations. Future studies on this topic should delve deeper into understanding how each predictor and risk factor influence PTSD prevalence. Novel data and methodologies that account for confounding variables are essential to comprehensively determine whether the disorder's prevalence varies based on sample age (children v. adults) and the type of traumatic event (intentional v. non-intentional).

Finally, it is vital to convert evidence-based insights into updated diagnostic guidelines widely accepted by the scientific community. Precise assessment criteria and systematic investigation protocols should be established to evaluate the disease across various contexts effectively. This concerted effort will improve our ability to diagnose and treat PTSD accurately and tailor interventions more effectively to individual needs.

### Neuroimaging of posttraumatic stress disorder in adults and youth: progress over the last decade on three leading questions of the field [^113AWXLv]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Epidemiology and prognosis

Worldwide, up to 70% of the adult population will experience at least one traumatic event (as defined by criterion A) in their lifetime, and the prevalence of PTSD ranges from 2 to 9%. Indeed, four post-traumatic symptom trajectories have been highlighted in literature: resiliency, recovery, chronic, and delayed onset, the most common being the resiliency trajectory. Similarly, childhood trauma exposure is common, with up to two-thirds of youth reported having experienced a traumatic event and almost 5% of trauma-exposed youth meeting the criteria for PTSD. It is important to note that females are more prone to developing PTSD than males. This disparity is theorized to be attributed to trauma one is exposed to, with females experiencing more interpersonal violence than males. However, even when controlling for trauma type, females still exhibit greater PTSD prevalence. This suggests that biological factors may contribute to this disparity. Given this, more studies are introducing sex as a biological variable to explore this disparity further. For in-depth reviews, see.

PTSD is a debilitating disorder in many aspects across the lifespan. A PTSD diagnosis contributes to billions in annual productivity loss and increased medical problems and is associated with a variety of co-occurring disorders, including substance use disorders, depression, and anxiety. For individuals diagnosed with PTSD, many treatment options are available. The most empirically supported options are trauma-focused interventions. Of psychotherapy options available, up to half of the patients who complete treatment will show clinically meaningful improvement, and many patients prematurely drop out of treatment before receiving an adequate dose. Furthermore, many patients fail to seek treatment altogether, especially in marginalized groups. Given the considerable overlap between PTSD, depression, and anxiety, and because research still has not identified pharmaceutical targets specific for PTSD, sertraline and paroxetine are FDA-approved pharmacological options for PTSD, both with limited efficacy. Research on using psychedelics to treat PTSD has skyrocketed and looks promising, though more research is needed to determine efficacy and validate safe implementation procedures. Psychotherapeutic treatments have shown a greater benefit than pharmacological intervention alone. Determining the superiority of combining psychotherapy with pharmacological treatment needs further exploration. To improve the efficacy of current treatment options and to design novel, more efficacious treatment options, we must understand the neural alterations that contribute to the development of PTSD, improve with treatment, and potentially define biotypes of the disorder.

### Pharmacological interventions for preventing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [^111weNsc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder which, after a sufficient delay, may be diagnosed amongst individuals who respond with intense fear, helplessness or horror to traumatic events. There is some evidence that the use of pharmacological interventions immediately after exposure to trauma may reduce the risk of developing of PTSD.

Objectives

To assess the effects of pharmacological interventions for the prevention of PTSD in adults following exposure to a traumatic event.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Controlled Trials Register (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) (to 14 February 2014). This register contains relevant reports of randomised controlled trials from the following bibliographic databases: CENTRAL (all years); EMBASE (1974 to date); MEDLINE (1950 to date) and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We identified unpublished trials by searching the National Institute of Health (NIH) Reporter, the metaRegister of Controlled Trials database (mRCT) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (to December 2013). We scanned the reference lists of articles for additional studies. We placed no constraints on language and setting.

Selection Criteria

We restricted studies to randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological interventions compared with placebo for the prevention of PTSD in adults.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors (TA and JI) independently assessed trials for eligibility and inclusion based on the review selection criteria. We independently extracted sample, methodological, outcome and 'Risk of bias' data, as well as the number of side effects, from each trial and entered these into a customised data extraction form. We contacted investigators for missing information. We calculated summary statistics for continuous and dichotomous variables (if provided). We did not undertake subgroup analyses due to the small number of included studies.

Main Results

We included nine short-term RCTs (duration 12 weeks or less) in the analysis (345 participants; age range 18 to 76 years). Participants were exposed to a variety of traumas, ranging from assault, traffic accidents and work accidents to cardiac surgery and septic shock. Seven studies were conducted at single centres. The seven RCTs included four hydrocortisone studies, three propranolol studies (of which one study had a third arm investigating gabapentin), and single trials of escitalopram and temazepam. Outcome assessment measures included the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), the 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and the Center for Epidemiological Studies - Depression Scale (CES-D). In four trials with 165 participants there was moderate quality evidence for the efficacy of hydrocortisone in preventing the onset of PTSD (risk ratio (RR) 0.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.05 to 0.56; P value = 0.004), indicating that between seven and 13 patients would need to be treated with this agent in order to prevent the onset of PTSD in one patient. There was low quality evidence for preventing the onset of PTSD in three trials with 118 participants treated with propranolol (RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.24 to 1.59; P value = 0.32). Drop-outs due to treatment-emergent side effects, where reported, were low for all of the agents tested. Three of the four RCTs of hydrocortisone reported that medication was more effective than placebo in reducing PTSD symptoms after a median of 4.5 months after the event. None of the single trials of escitalopram, temazepam and gabapentin demonstrated evidence that medication was superior to placebo in preventing the onset of PTSD. Seven of the included RCTs were at a high risk of bias. Differential drop-outs between groups undermined the results of three studies, while one study failed to describe how the allocation of medication was concealed. Other forms of bias that might have influenced study results included possible confounding through group differences in concurrent medication and termination of the study based on treatment response.

Authors' Conclusions

There is moderate quality evidence for the efficacy of hydrocortisone for the prevention of PTSD development in adults. We found no evidence to support the efficacy of propranolol, escitalopram, temazepam and gabapentin in preventing PTSD onset. The findings, however, are based on a few small studies with multiple limitations. Further research is necessary in order to determine the efficacy of pharmacotherapy in preventing PTSD and to identify potential moderators of treatment effect.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults [^111F2gXS]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

PTSD background — definitions and global burden: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is described in DSM–5, text rev., and in the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases (11th ed.), which distinguishes between a pared-down PTSD and a complex PTSD diagnosis. PTSD is characterized by exposure to a potentially traumatic event or events with persistence of specific trauma-related symptoms beyond initial reactions (defined as several weeks or one month) and functional impairment. Trauma exposure underlies a worldwide 5.6% lifetime prevalence of PTSD, encompassing over 450 million adults and children.

### Treating PTSD within the context of heightened suicide risk [^114pr5fk]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Because posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is one of the few psychological conditions that predict suicidal behavior among those who think about suicide, many patients with PTSD present clinically with elevated suicide risk. Expert consensus and practice guidelines recommend against trauma-focused treatments for patients with elevated suicide risk, however. Research aimed at understanding the common mechanisms that underlie the association of PTSD and suicide risk has led to several advances in the effective care of suicidal patients diagnosed with PTSD. Based on these results, various combinations and sequences of suicide-focused treatments, risk management procedures, and trauma-focused treatments are implicated.

### Different trajectories of PTSD symptoms during the acute post-trauma period [^111Fn9TE]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The majority of adults in the United States will experience a potentially traumatic event during their lifetime, yet only a subset will develop posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The trajectory of symptoms in the period of time immediately following the trauma (the acute post-trauma period) may be important in determining which individuals develop PTSD. The current study examined trajectories of PTSD symptom severity across the acute post-trauma period and if membership in these trajectories was predictive of PTSD symptom severity, depression symptoms, and functional impairment 1- and 3-months post-trauma. Four trajectories were identified: low and decreasing, rapid decreasing, slow decreasing, and consistently high. Further, trajectory membership in the acute post-trauma period was found to predict differences in PTSD symptoms, depression symptoms, and functional impairment severity at both 1- and 3- months post-trauma. These findings highlight a relationship between PTSD symptoms during the acute post-trauma period and later impairment.

### Post-traumatic stress disorder and post-traumatic stress symptoms following critical illness in medical intensive care unit patients: assessing the magnitude of the problem [^1157TRoL]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Key messages

- PTSD or PTSD symptoms are reported to occur in between 5% and 63% of ICU survivors, and key risk factors include duration of hospital and ICU stays, duration of ventilation, pre-existing psychiatric history, and the presence of delusional memories.

- Reported rates of PTSD prevalence following the ICU tend to be extremely high relative to other trauma populations, including medical and surgical patients, and are likely to be overestimates.

- Studies of PTSD following critical illness are characterized by significant methodological shortcomings, which raise key questions about the actual prevalence rates of PTSD and the generalizability of study findings.

- Future studies on PTSD should be more methodically rigorous and should use larger and more homogeneous samples while also employing comprehensive diagnostic, as opposed to screening, instruments.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults [^111AE5ju]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults — assessment and comorbidities — clinicians are encouraged to evaluate trauma history, including adverse childhood experiences, and comorbidities comprehensively and to engage in shared decision-making that considers these factors yet maintains the structure. Clinicians are encouraged to assess for and track prior and ongoing trauma exposure, PTSD symptoms, comorbid conditions, and associated problems using a standardized tool validated for use in populations that match with the patient, and these comorbidities may complicate or prolong the course of PTSD and/or necessitate additional safety monitoring.

### Prevalence and risk factors of childbirth-related post-traumatic stress symptoms [^11382MM5]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after childbirth was initially described by Bydlowski and Raoul-Duval. Several studies indicated that childbirth is associated with post-traumatic stress disorder and it can disrupt childcare in infancy. In addition it has been shown that pregnancy occurrence after a traumatic birth experience may also result in the seek abortion, or request for unnecessary cesarean section in subsequent pregnancies.

The PTSD is an anxiety disorder that can occur secondary to exposure to extreme events (stressors) that are at outside of the usual range of human experience. Childbirth is a physiologic and predictable event. Thus, the American Physiatrist Association was unable to classify childbirth as a traumatic disorder. However, since the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Revision 4 (DSM-IV) re-defined the criterion for a stressor, it was suggested that this new definition might also apply to childbirth as a traumatic event.

There is evidence that traumatic birth experiences are associated with post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms. Studies have shown that different risk factors contribute to the development of post-partum PTSD including history of psychological problems, trait anxiety, obstetric procedures, negative aspects in staff-mother contact, sense of control, and social support. Even, studies indicated that a history of trauma, in particular childhood sexual abuse (CSA), might be a risk factor for higher distress levels in pregnancy, and for post-partum post-traumatic stress symptoms. In addition several studies revealed that the obstetrics factors and complicated deliveries were the most significant indicators of the post-partum PTSD. However, if risk factors for PTSD were identified in pregnancy, primary prevention might be possible, and it could be prevented by support from health care providers.

Every year about 1,363,542 women in Iran give birth. Of these it is estimated that 35% of deliveries are cesarean sections and very likely subject to a traumatic birth. There are limited reports about the post-partum PTSD in Iran. Thus, the aim of present study was to estimate the prevalence of childbirth-related post-traumatic stress symptoms and its obstetric and perinatal risk factors among a sample of Iranian women. By examining the risk factors associated with PTSD after childbirth health practitioners are better able to help with prevention or management of possible posttraumatic stress symptoms associated with childbirth.

### Suicide risk in people with post-traumatic stress disorder: a cohort study of 3.1 million people in Sweden [^1112bAXP]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD] is a psychiatric diagnosis describing a prolonged or delayed response to a traumatic situation or event(s) of a threatening or catastrophic nature. Symptoms include repeatedly reliving the experience, in the form of intrusive memories known as "flashbacks" or repeated dreams, experiencing significant distress when exposed to a situation similar to or associated with the traumatic experience, avoidance of such situations, inability to recall aspects of the trauma, or persistent symptoms of psychological arousal not present before the trauma. A recent World Health Organisation [WHO] study in 24 countries estimated that lifetime PTSD prevalence varied from 2•1% in lower low-middle income countries to 5•0% in high-income countries including Sweden (5•6%). Lifetime prevalence also varies by gender, and is consistently reported as being twice as high in women than men, with one US study placing estimates at 10•4% and 5•0%, respectively.

Such variation in prevalence may arise due to differential exposure to traumatic factors, differences in internalising and externalising such experiences, differences in recovery and survival following PTSD or differences in diagnostic practice in different settings. For example, PTSD is a risk factor for subsequent suicidal ideation and attempt, and has been linked to death by suicide, although results from these systematic reviews and meta-analyses are inconsistent. This may be attributable to methodological issues: most studies have been prevalence-based, conducted in veteran or military samples, or have sometimes inappropriately adjusted for comorbid mental health conditions on the causal pathway between PTSD and suicide. Only two population-based studies have examined the association between PTSD and death by suicide, both conducted using Danish register data. The first, a case-control study of all suicide deaths in Denmark between 1994 and 2006, found that the odds of death by suicide was 5.3 times higher in those with a diagnosis of PTSD compared with those without, after controlling for psychiatric and other demographic variables. A second study, following a Danish population cohort between 1995 and 2011, found that suicide rates were 13 times greater in those diagnosed with PTSD, adjusting for confounders as above. Although the largest of these studies included over 500,000 participants, given the absolute rarity of both PTSD and death by suicide, it could only include 32 participants with both the exposure and outcome, limiting the ability to detect variation by other characteristics such as sex, or control for all previous major psychiatric conditions or previous non-fatal suicide attempts.

### The epidemiology of trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder in a representative cohort of young people in england and wales [^111Ru1gd]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Relatively little is known about the epidemiology of trauma exposure and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in representative samples of young people. We searched PubMed up to July 1, 2018, with the following terms: ("post-traumatic stress disorder" OR "posttraumatic stress disorder" OR "post traumatic stress disorder" OR "PTSD") AND ("young" OR "youth" OR "adolescent" OR "child" OR "pediatric" OR "paediatric" OR "juvenile"). We did not apply any date or language restrictions. We identified population-based studies of trauma exposure and PTSD in young people done in high-income countries. This search was supplemented by reviewing reference lists and forward citations of relevant articles. We identified 11 original studies. Taken together, these studies suggest that trauma exposure and PTSD in young people are prevalent, are associated with a large health burden, and are linked to pre-existing risk factors. However, there are several gaps in knowledge. First, these studies were largely done more than a decade ago in the United States (seven studies), UK (two studies), Germany (one study), and Switzerland (one study) based on now-obsolete diagnostic criteria for PTSD. The UK studies — the 1999 and 2004 British Child and Adolescent Mental Health Surveys — only estimated the point prevalence of PTSD. Second, the breadth of the investigations was often limited: only three studies assessed PTSD comorbidity; only two studies explored risk events and impairment; and none measured service use. Finally, studies to date have not tested the prediction performance of identified risk factors for PTSD to inform the development of screening programmes.

### Pharmacological prevention and early treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113Xt4sC]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Data extraction

Data were extracted by two independent reviewers (L. A.W. and J. I.B.) using identical data extraction forms. There were only minor irregularities between reviewers, which were discussed and consensus agreed on. Study authors were contacted if more information was required. Basic demographic data and details of the intervention used was collected along with primary outcomes of PTSD/ASD symptom severity and incidence.

Assessment of study bias

The Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias in randomised trials'was used for each identified study. This tool assesses the likelihood of bias in randomised trials, including the adequate generation of allocation sequence, acceptable concealment of allocation, satisfactory blinding of participants and personnel, and assessing the degree of incomplete outcome data. Risk of bias was assessed by two independent reviewers (L. A.W. and J. I.B.) and any disagreement resolved by discussion. These ratings were considered and a GRADE judgement (which assesses quality of evidence to make recommendations for clinical practice) was presented for each outcome.

Synthesis of results

The primary outcome in the meta-analysis was reduction in PTSD symptoms 3–6 months after the traumatic event (but it was agreed a priori that the nearest time point to this would be accepted, and if there was no measure of PTSD symptoms, ASD symptoms would be included instead). This was performed using a random-effects model. PTSD incidence at 3–6 months after the traumatic event was also considered. For PTSD/ASD incidence we calculated risk ratios whereas for severity we calculated standardised mean differences, along with associated confidence intervals. For outcomes including more than one study we measured statistical heterogeneity by calculating the I² statistic (t). As this was low for all results it did not change our analyses. Data was pooled if outcomes included two or more studies. Sub-group analyses were not performed as there were few studies for individual outcomes. All analyses were done using the Cochrane Collaboration's Review Manager 5.3 software.

### Posttraumatic stress disorder and stress-related disorders [^115yE6di]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a prevalent anxiety disorder. Symptoms present shortly after an exposure to a traumatic event, abate with time in the majority of those who initially express them, and leave a significant minority with chronic PTSD. PTSD may be treated with pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy. Treatment of the early expressions of the disorder constitutes a separate domain of theory and research. Treatment of chronic PTSD often stabilizes the condition but rarely produces stable remission. This article reviews the empirical evidence on the treatment of acute and chronic PTSD, outlines similarities and differences between PTSD and other Axis I disorders, evaluates new therapeutic approaches, and discusses the implications of current knowledge for the forthcoming DSM-V.

Exposure to trauma can result in immune dysregulation, and increasing evidence suggests that there are immune alterations associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the exact nature of these immune findings in PTSD has not been defined. The study of psychoneuroimmunology in PTSD is relevant not only for understanding the biological underpinnings of this disorder, but also for establishing the nature of the associations between PTSD and other medical and psychiatric illnesses.

### Newer insights into the role of miRNA a tiny genetic tool in psychiatric disorders: focus on post-traumatic stress disorder [^113aJRXx]. Translational Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental illness that results from the experience or witnessing of traumatic or life-threatening events. It was first officially recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd ed. (DSM III) in 1980, and since then knowledge has accumulated about the characteristics, symptomatology and epidemiology of PTSD as well as assessment and treatment of individuals suffering from this disorder. According to DSM-5, the diagnostic criteria for PTSD includes experiencing at least one symptom from the re-experiencing factor, at least one symptom from the avoidance factor, two or more symptoms from the negative alterations in cognitions and mood factor, and two or more symptoms from the alterations in arousal and reactivity factor, along with significant functional impairment and at least a one-month duration of the symptoms. It can be categorized under two types, acute or chronic. In acute PTSD, symptoms last for at least 1 month but < 3 months after the traumatic event. In chronic PTSD, symptoms last for more than 3 months after exposure to trauma.PTSD patients with either type frequently show socio-behavioral problems and have a higher risk of alcohol and drug abuse. In addition, structural changes in the prefrontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus, and biochemical changes such as increase in norepinephrine/cortisol in urine, elevated total cholesterol in the blood and higher levels of norepinephrine in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are hallmarks of PTSD. PTSD included as a new chapter in DSM-5 on trauma and stressor-related disorders. This move from DSM-IV, which addressed PTSD as an anxiety disorder, and its symptoms, includes depression, outbursts of anger, self-destructive behavior, and feelings of shame, self-blame and distrust. Notable biological findings in PTSD include derangements in the noradrenergic/sympathetic brain systems and the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis, increased CSF concentrations of corticotropin-releasing factor; reduced volume of the hippocampus, functional differences in responding of fear system brain regions, such as hyperactivation of the amygdala and hypoactivation of the prefrontal cortex; sleep disturbances, measures of hyperarousal in response to stimuli and of delayed habituation to loud noises, and evidence for impaired conditioned fear extinction recall. The currently available pharmacotherapies target the different phenotypes of PTSD, such as anxious, depressive, externalizing and dissociative. Multisite randomized clinical trials have noted the efficacy of FDA-approved selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors for PTSD treatment. Although alternatives to serotonin reuptake inhibitors and mixed serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors in PTSD would be desirable, little data supports the use of other antidepressants, benzodiazepines, atypical antipsychotics for clinical symptoms. The comorbid psychotic features such as nightmares and sleep disturbance in PTSD treated by Prazosin and alpha-1-adrenergic antagonist that attenuates noradrenergic-mediated suppression of rapid eye movement sleep in preclinical work. However, there are currently no pharmacotherapy treatments that can be recommended clinically for the prevention of PTSD development post-trauma. The overall response rate of serotonin reuptake inhibitors treatment is about 60% in PTSD patients and only 20–30% of patients achieve complete remission. Unfortunately, there have been no other new medications approved to treat PTSD in the past 10 years.

### Complex PTSD symptoms predict positive symptoms of psychosis in the flow of daily life [^111LqiJy]. Psychological Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Traumatic life experiences increase psychosis risk (Bell, Foulds, Horwood, Mulder, & Boden; Varese et al.), and symptoms of post-traumatic stress mediate this relationship (Alameda et al; Sideli et al; Williams, Bucci, Berry, & Varese). In addition to the high rates of childhood trauma, people with psychosis also have a high risk of re-victimization that compounds the risk of symptoms of post-traumatic stress (De Vries et al.). Comorbid post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is therefore unsurprisingly common among people with psychosis, worsening mental health outcomes (DeTore, Gottlieb, & Mueser). However, it is unclear which post-traumatic sequelae account for the association between trauma and psychosis. The diagnostic conceptualization of PTSD has been subject to much debate, particularly regarding the extent to which it should focus on 'core' symptoms (i.e. intrusions, avoidance, hyperarousal) or those commonly associated with the complex trauma histories typically experienced by people with psychosis, conceptualized as disturbances of self-organization (DSOs; emotional dysregulation, interpersonal difficulties, negative self-concept) (Karatzias et al; Trauelsen et al.). The newly classified diagnosis of complex PTSD (cPTSD) includes the core symptoms of PTSD as well as DSOs (Maercker et al.).

Outcome prioritization for guideline evidence in adult PTSD — the APA clinical practice guideline for PTSD is primarily based on findings from efficacy studies, with the reduction or loss of PTSD symptoms and diagnosis and presence of severe adverse events as the considered critical outcomes. The updated guideline also considered certain comorbidities when the data was available, and when planning treatment in the context of shared decision-making with a patient, the recommendations and supplementary information will be a useful addition to the treatment process.

I have presented two complementary lines of speculation in this article. First, I have presented a public health model of resilience, prevention, acute intervention, and tertiary treatment to inform a pharmacotherapeutic strategy for PTSD in the future. Second, I have proposed a rational rather than an empirical approach to the clinical pharmacology of PTSD. Such an approach suggests that efforts be directed toward the development and testing of new classes of drugs designed to target the unique pathophysiology of PTSD.

### Post-traumatic stress disorders and coping strategies of health professionals during COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh: findings of a countrywide cross-sectional study [^112oYz3z]. The Lancet Regional Health: Southeast Asia (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

On 11 March 2020, Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic due to its widespread nature. This pandemic arose as a global public health emergency in the modern era, and it is responsible for various psychological issues, including anxiety, depression, and stress among professionals.COVID-19 also had a substantial impact on the mental health of healthcare personnel, including symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression.

Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a common, disabling disorder that appears after exposure to a traumatic experience. The present study considered PTSD as a condition of persistent mental and emotional stress, which occurs following a traumatic experience or witness during COVID-19 patient management. The prevalence of PTSD may vary depending on the occupation of individuals. A recent study on Bangladeshi students determined a 40.91% prevalence rate of post-traumatic stress symptoms.

Healthcare workers in emergency care settings are particularly at risk of PTSD because of the highly stressful work-related situations. The PTSD rate had been reported to range from 10% to 20%, even with a higher rate (8%–30%) among the workers in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). This critical condition was exacerbated by personal protective equipment use, which caused discomfort and difficulties in breathing. Toward the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, hospitals worldwide lacked preparation of personal protective equipment, as well as guidelines or treatment, were not well established. As a consequence, health workers perceived vulnerability, helplessness, alienation, isolation, and difficulties in coping with excessive workload. Furthermore, they had to face loneliness, perception of stigma, and indefinite expectations, which lead to several emotional and psychological outcomes, such as anger, anxiety, insomnia, and post-traumatic stress related to the uncertainty of the pandemic. Half of those who experienced post-traumatic nightmares might have dreams that exactly replicate the traumatic event.

### PTSD course and predictors in a 15 year longitudinal cohort following suspected serious injury [^114SUVde]. Npj Mental Health Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Exposure to traumatic events typically causes initial psychological distress that subsides within a few weeks post-trauma. However, for a considerable subset of those exposed, trauma exposure results in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with an average conditional risk estimated at 4%. PTSD symptoms include intrusions, avoidance, negative mood and cognitions, and alterations in arousal and reactivity. PTSD is linked to negative health outcomes and functional impairments, including increased comorbidity and mortality, and reduced (health-related) quality of life –. Retrospective epidemiological data from the WHO Mental Health Surveys show that the mean duration of PTSD symptoms is six years, with considerable differences in mean duration between trauma types (i.e. higher for war-related experienced, lower for accidents). This amounts to extensive economic costs and societal burden, besides the individual impact. However, to date, there is only limited prospective longitudinal research addressing long-term PTSD outcomes more than a decade beyond traumatic events.

These prospective longitudinal studies on long-term PTSD symptoms (> 10 years) were predominantly carried out among uniformed services staff (e.g. veterans)and people affected by collective/mass trauma (e.g. tsunami). In the first long-term longitudinal study following civilians experiencing individual trauma beyond a decade, we recently observed that nearly 5% of adults had long-term PTSD related to previous exposure to a potentially traumatic event resulting in (suspected) serious injury of 12–15 years ago. Higher levels of PTSD symptoms were associated with a broad range of adverse psychological and functional outcomes (e.g. more depressive symptoms, lower quality of life), further underscoring the potential long-lasting impact of individual civilian trauma.

A growing number of longitudinal studies following individual civilian trauma exposure are investigating PTSD symptom trajectories, with the endpoint assessment typically at one-year post-trauma and maximally at six years post-trauma. These trajectory-oriented approaches are used to classify individuals into distinct patterns of PTSD symptom severity over time, thus taking the heterogeneous course of PTSD into account. A meta-analytical study identified four commonly observed PTSD symptom trajectories across these studies: resilience (i.e. continuous minimal symptoms), recovery (i.e. high initial symptoms but remitting), chronic (i.e. stable high symptoms) and delayed onset (i.e. increasing symptoms). It has not been investigated yet how these one-year PTSD trajectories relate to long-term PTSD outcome.

### Post-traumatic stress disorder and post-traumatic stress symptoms following critical illness in medical intensive care unit patients: assessing the magnitude of the problem [^114HbTTx]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a potentially serious psychiatric disorder that has traditionally been associated with traumatic stressors such as participation in combat, violent assault, and survival of natural disasters. Recently, investigators have reported that the experience of critical illness can also lead to PTSD, although details of the association between critical illness and PTSD remain unclear.

Methods

We conducted keyword searches of MEDLINE and Psych Info and investigations of secondary references for all articles pertaining to PTSD in medical intensive care unit (ICU) survivors.

Results

From 78 screened papers, 16 studies (representing 15 cohorts) and approximately 920 medical ICU patients met inclusion criteria. A total of 10 investigations used brief PTSD screening tools exclusively as opposed to more comprehensive diagnostic methods. Reported PTSD prevalence rates varied from 5% to 63%, with the three highest prevalence estimates occurring in studies with fewer than 30 patients. Loss to follow-up rates ranged from 10% to 70%, with average loss to follow-up rates exceeding 30%.

Conclusion

Exact PTSD prevalence rates cannot be determined due to methodological limitations such as selection bias, loss to follow-up, and the wide use of screening (as opposed to diagnostic) instruments. In general, the high prevalence rates reported in the literature are likely to be overestimates due to the limitations of the investigations conducted to date. Although PTSD may be a serious problem in some survivors of critical illness, data on the whole population are inconclusive. Because the magnitude of the problem posed by PTSD in survivors of critical illness is unknown, there remains a pressing need for larger and more methodologically rigorous investigations of PTSD in ICU survivors.

### Prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder and depressive symptoms among civilians residing in armed conflict-affected regions: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116dwkci]. General Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, and the PRISMA checklist has been added as online supplemental appendix 1. The protocol was registered a priori with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42023416096).

Data sources and search strategy

The present study aimed to estimate the pooled prevalence of PTSD and depressive symptoms in war or armed conflict-affected regions. For this purpose, two authors (SHA and AZ) independently conducted a thorough literature search across major health databases (ie, MEDLINE(R), Embase Classic+Embase, APA PsycINFO, Ovid Healthstar, Journal@Ovid Full Text, Cochrane, PTSDpubs and CINAHL) from inception until 19 March 2024. Relevant keywords were obtained via the Medical Subject Heading browser tool alongside synonyms; alternate spellings were employed and included "Depression" "Depressive Symptoms" "Emotional Depression" "Major Depressive Disorder" "MDD" "Major Depression" "Acute Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder" "Chronic Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder" "Delayed Onset Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder" "Neuroses, Post-Traumatic" "PTSD" "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders" "Stress Disorder Post Traumatic" "Posttraumatic Stress Symptoms" "War" "Warzone" "Civil War" "Warfare" "Genocide" "Holocaust" and "Armed Conflict". The bibliographies of included studies were also thoroughly evaluated to acquire comprehensive search results. Furthermore, relevant published systematic reviews and meta-analyses were shortlisted, and their citations were screened to identify any potentially missed articles. Duplicates were removed manually using the Zotero citation manager.

### Post deployment care for returning combat veterans [^114Re1g3]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Recognizing and Treating PTSD

Given the high rates of co-morbid PTSD and depression, clinicians should routinely assess for both. Because there is the potential for delayed onset and the rapid progression of symptoms, current VA/DoD guidelines recommend reassessment for PTSD and depression within 3 to 6 months and annually thereafter. It should be noted that those who screen negative for PTSD, but have sub-syndromal trauma-related symptoms may carry a high risk for suicide. If trauma related symptoms are present, a suicide risk assessment is appropriate given the increased risk for suicide in this population. The veteran described here expressed that he does not care what happens to him. This should raise concern for possible suicidality and prompt immediate assessment.

Primary care providers should recognize the hallmark signs and symptoms of PTSD. Exposure to a perceived life-threatening experience is necessary for diagnosis. PTSD is characterized by re-experiencing (such as intrusive thoughts or recollections, or nightmares), avoidance or numbing, and increased arousal (such as insomnia, irritability, or the classic startle response). Our patient has symptoms in all three symptom clusters: his re-experiencing takes the form of frequent vivid nightmares, his avoidance/numbing is in his lack of trust and use of alcohol, and he clearly is irritated and anxious (hyper-arousal symptoms). Nevertheless, clinicians should be cautious about diagnosing PTSD in the initial phases of readjustment. PTSD is highly co-morbid with other mental health problems, such as depression and panic disorder; establishing an accurate diagnosis can be complicated. Often, veterans do not wish to be labeled and feel that by seeking treatment they are admitting to weakness. Misperceptions about PTSD should be corrected and normalized by explaining that post-traumatic stress symptoms are quite common in the post-deployment period.

### The structure of co-occurring PTSD and depression symptoms in a cohort of marines pre-and post-deployment [^117M1ZYH]. Psychiatry Research (2018). Low credibility.

Symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder are the most frequently co-occurring problems following potentially traumatic events. It is unclear whether these comorbidities represent two correlated but distinct disorders or a common post-event response. We sought to inform this question by examining the distinctiveness of PTSD and depression symptoms at four cross-sectional time points, using data from a parent prospective longitudinal study of 858 Marines evaluated before deployment and approximately 1, 5, and 8 months after returning from the Afghanistan war. We conducted a series of cross-sectional confirmatory factor analyses of PTSD and depression symptoms at each time point, using the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist IV and the Beck Depression Inventory II. Analyses indicated that across all four assessments, self-reported symptoms on the measures were best explained by distinct but correlated subclusters of symptoms within each measure. This structure was supported by the data both before and after deployment, even with increases in average PTSD symptoms after deployment. These findings suggest that despite shared method variance and some symptom overlap, self-reports of PTSD and depression symptoms across a stressful combat deployment show distinct symptom subclusters rather than a general common trauma reaction in this sample of Marines.

### Is there a common pathway to developing ASD and PTSD symptoms? [^111ZCMw7]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Numerous studies have identified risk factors for acute and long-term posttraumatic stress symptoms following traumatic exposure. However, little is known about whether there are common pathways to the development of acute stress disorder (ASD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Research suggests that a common path to ASD and PTSD may lie in peritraumatic responses and cognitions. The results of structural equation modeling in a national sample of Danish bank robbery victims (N = 450) show that peritraumatic panic, anxiety sensitivity, and negative cognitions about self were significant common risk factors for both ASD severity and PTSD severity when controlled for the effect of the other risk factors. The strongest common risk factor was negative cognitions about self. Future research should focus on replicating these results as they point to possible areas of preventive and treatment actions against the development of traumatic stress symptoms.

### Pharmacological prevention and early treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112jvoLZ]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

We adopted a methodology based on the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventionsand a PRISMA checklist was completed.

Selection criteria

The inclusion criteria were: (a) any RCT (including cluster and cross-over trials); (b) investigating the effects of pharmacological intervention delivered within three months of the traumatic event; (c) when compared to placebo, pharmacological or psychosocial interventions; (d) in participants exposed to a traumatic event likely to meet the A criterion for DSM5 PTSD; and (e) PTSD or ASD symptoms measured using one or more validated clinician administered or self-report outcome measures. There was no restriction on the severity of PTSD/ASD symptoms or the type of traumatic event, no restriction on sample size, and both published and unpublished studies were eligible for inclusion. Only studies published in English were included.

Search strategy and selection criteria

For this review we combined an updated search undertaken by the Cochrane Collaboration with the original search strategy from the review of Sijbrandij et al. This systematic review was undertaken alongside a number of other reviews carried out to update the ISTSS Treatment Guidelines. As part of this all RCTs related to the prevention and treatment of PTSD from 2013 to the 31st May 2018 were identified and scrutinised, producing 16 new papers on early pharmacotherapy considered in more detail here. For this updated search the inclusion criteria were reconsidered and subsequently much broader. The time frame for intervention was extended to 3 months post-trauma. The original search strategy used PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase and the Cochrane database of randomised trials with no limitation on start date. Terms referring to PTSD were combined with terms referring to pharmacotherapy (using both MeSH terms and text words) and we also checked the references of four narrative reviews of pharmacological prevention of PTSD. Details of the searches and exact search strings are provided in the appendix.

All titles and abstracts were appraised by two independent screeners and any disagreements were discussed. The full text of any potentially relevant papers was acquired and if we were unable to locate the full text for any study the corresponding author was contacted to request the paper. To determine if potentially relevant studies met the inclusion criteria the full text was independently reviewed by two authors (L. A.W. and J. I.B.).

### Posttraumatic stress disorder: clinical features, pathophysiology, and treatment [^1141tXYf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PSTD), classified as an anxiety disorder, has become increasingly important because of wars overseas, natural disasters, and domestic violence. After trauma exposes the victim to actual or threatened death or serious injury, 3 dimensions of PTSD unfold: (1) reexperiencing the event with distressing recollections, dreams, flashbacks, and/or psychologic and physical distress; (2) persistent avoidance of stimuli that might invite memories or experiences of the trauma; and (3) increased arousal. Traumatic events sufficient to produce PTSD in susceptible subjects may reach a lifetime prevalence of 50% to 90%. The actual lifetime prevalence of PTSD among US citizens is approximately 8%, with the clinical course driven by pathophysiologic changes in the amygdala and hippocampus. Comorbid depression and other anxiety disorders are common. General principles of treatment include the immediate management of PTSD symptoms and signs; management of any trauma-related comorbid conditions; nonpharmacologic interventions including cognitive behavioral treatment; and psychopharmacologic agents including antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors most commonly), antianxiety medications, mood stabilizing drugs, and antipsychotics. This review of PTSD will provide the reader with a clearer understanding of this condition, an increased capacity to recognize and treat this syndrome, and a greater appreciation for the role of the internist in PTSD.

### Post-traumatic symptoms after COVID-19 may (or may not) reflect disease severity [^117NEKQG]. Psychological Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

To the editor

We note emerging reports, including in this journal, of a high prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and post-traumatic stress (PTS) symptoms in patients with COVID-19 (Bo et al; Wesemann et al.). These reports arise in the context of previous coronavirus pandemics in which PTSD occurred with a point-prevalence of 32.2% (Rogers et al.). Although it may be presumed that this increased risk would translate across to COVID-19 patients, potential factors underlying this heightened vulnerability have received minimal attention.

It is well-recognised that severe critical illness can cause lasting psychological trauma. PTSD is an established sequela of intensive care admission, with pooled prevalence estimates of 17–44% after intensive care unit (ICU) care (Parker et al.). The similarity of this prevalence range to that arising after SARS-CoV infection (Rogers et al.) prompted the hypothesis that ICU admission could be a key driving factor behind the high prevalence of PTSD/PTS in patients with COVID-19. This hypothesis would predict that most patients with COVID-19 who develop PTSD/PTS were at one point critically ill and subsequently admitted to ICU. However, this has not been definitively established.

We are a research collaboration of clinical academics evaluating the neurology and neuropsychiatry of COVID-19. Our platform allows us to examine emerging trends in the COVID-19 neuropsychiatry literature (Butler et al.). During that process and in partial contrast to the hypothesis that illness severity is the key driving factor in the development of PTSD, recent reports have emerged of PTS in patients with mild-moderate COVID-19. Estimates of the frequency of psychological trauma after mild-moderate disease currently vary. For example, Liu et al. evaluated PTS in 675 patients with predominantly mild-moderate COVID-19 disease, using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5). They found that 12.4% of patients had clinically meaningful PTS. By contrast, a far higher prevalence was reported by Bo et al. in this journal, who used the civilian version of a PTSD questionnaire based on DSM-IV (PCL-C). These authors found a prevalence of PTS of 96.2% in 714 patients with mild-moderate COVID-19 admitted to a government quarantine facility. How should we evaluate such a wide discrepancy?

### Trauma exposure and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder in emergency medical services personnel in Hawaii [^114CM46H]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Exposure to traumatic stressors is potentially an integral part of the job for emergency medical services (EMS) personnel, placing them at risk for psychological distress and mental health problems.

Study Objective

The prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and post-traumatic stress symptoms was examined in a sample of EMS personnel in a multiethnic locality in Hawaii. Commonly encountered traumatic incidents at work were also assessed.

Methods

The PTSD Check List-Civilian version was sent to 220 EMS personnel. The survey included questions on demographics, traumatic incidents at work, general stressors, coping methods and post-traumatic stress symptoms.

Results

105 surveys were returned (48% response rate); 4% of respondents met clinical diagnostic criteria for PTSD, 1% met subclinical criteria for PTSD, 83% reported experiencing some symptoms but no PTSD and 12% had no symptoms. However, few had received treatment for these symptoms. Serious injury or death of a co-worker along with incidents involving children were considered very stressful. General work conditions also contributed to the overall stress levels. Most common coping strategies reported were positive reinterpretation (63%), seeking family and social support (59%) and awareness and venting of emotions (46%), with significant differences by ethnicity.

Conclusion

EMS personnel are at high risk of experiencing post-traumatic stress symptoms. Early identification and treatment of potential stressors, psychiatric and medical problems is warranted and necessitates ongoing assessment and employee assistance programmes at the minimum.

### DNA methylation levels are associated with CRFreceptor antagonist treatment outcome in women with post-traumatic stress disorder [^11765qma]. Clinical Epigenetics (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common psychiatric disorder with a prevalence of about 5% in the general population and an overall lifetime prevalence of 7–12%. Key symptoms of the disorder include intrusive memories, avoidance, and numbing as well as hyperarousal. Typically, these symptoms are long lasting and occur after exposure to traumatic life events. Women are twice as likely to develop the disease than men. PTSD therapies include both evidence-based psychotherapies and pharmacology, but only few patients attain remission. Currently, only two medications, paroxetine and sertraline, are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These SSRIs are capable of significantly reducing PTSD symptoms, but with only 20–30% remission rates to these agents, there is a need for additional pharmacologic treatment options.

Among pathophysiologic mechanisms that have been investigated for PTSD, disruptions of regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are among the most frequently cited hypotheses. A key regulator of the HPA axis is the corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) and its type 1 receptor (CRF 1 receptor), and many studies have reported alterations in this system in PTSD. Therefore, it represents a promising novel drug target for this disorder. In response to stress, CRF is secreted by nerve terminals of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and binds to the CRF 1 receptor in the adenohypophysis to release adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). This process acts as the initial step of HPA axis activation and leads to the release of a number of hormones from the adrenal cortex including cortisol. Numerous studies in laboratory animals as well as in humans indicate that abnormalities of these HPA axis regulators play a crucial role in stress-related disorders such as PTSD.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the management and rehabilitation of post-acute mild traumatic brain injury [^116E7v7R]. VA/DoD (2021). High credibility.

Behavioral symptoms after mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) — We suggest that patients with symptoms attributed to mild traumatic brain injury who present with behavioral health conditions, including posttraumatic stress disorder, substance use disorders, and mood disorders, be evaluated and managed the same whether they have had mild traumatic brain injury or not, according to the relevant existing VA/DoD clinical practice guidelines (Weak for | Reviewed, New-replaced). Depression, anxiety, and irritability are common, co-occurring behavioral symptoms after mTBI. Substance use disorders are also common among individuals with symptoms attributed to mTBI. The nature and severity of symptoms (including any presence of suicidal ideation and/or suicide risk), as ascertained in a thorough medical history, is necessary to choose appropriate treatments. Given the association of depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and other mental health disorders with a history of mTBI and other injuries, providers should assess for these conditions and consult related VA/DoD CPGs (e.g., major depressive disorder [MDD], PTSD, Patients at Risk for Suicide, substance use disorder [SUD]). The standard of care for psychological and behavioral symptoms following mTBI includes psychotherapeutic and pharmacologic treatment modalities. In the 2016 VA/DoD mTBI CPG, there was no high-quality evidence for any specific therapy for irritability and other behavioral symptoms (such as impulsivity) following mTBI, and to date, there are no medications specifically approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of post-mTBI psychiatric/behavioral symptoms.

### Posttraumatic stress disorder in critical illness survivors: a metaanalysis [^116jGc5Q]. Critical Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To conduct a systematic review and metaanalysis of the prevalence, risk factors, and prevention/treatment strategies for posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms in critical illness survivors.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library from inception through March 5, 2014.

Study Selection

Eligible studies met the following criteria: 1) adult general/nonspecialty ICU, 2) validated posttraumatic stress disorder instrument greater than or equal to 1 month post-ICU, and 3) sample size greater than or equal to 10 patients.

Data Extraction

Duplicate independent review and data abstraction from all eligible titles/abstracts/full-text articles.

Data Synthesis

The search identified 2,817 titles/abstracts, with 40 eligible articles on 36 unique cohorts (n = 4,260 patients). The Impact of Event Scale was the most common posttraumatic stress disorder instrument. Between 1 and 6 months post-ICU (six studies; n = 456), the pooled mean (95% CI) Impact of Event Scale score was 20 (17–24), and the pooled prevalences of clinically important posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (95% CI) were 25% (18–34%) and 44% (36–52%) using Impact of Event Scale thresholds greater than or equal to 35 and greater than or equal to 20, respectively. Between 7 and 12 months post-ICU (five studies; n = 698), the pooled mean Impact of Event Scale score was 17 (9–24), and pooled prevalences of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were 17% (10–26%) and 34% (22–50%), respectively. ICU risk factors for posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms included benzodiazepine administration and post-ICU memories of frightening ICU experiences. Posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms were associated with worse quality of life. In European-based studies: 1) an ICU diary was associated with a significant reduction in posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, 2) a self-help rehabilitation manual was associated with significant posttraumatic stress disorder symptom reduction at 2 months, but not 6 months; and 3) a nurse-led ICU follow-up clinic did not reduce posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.

Conclusions

Clinically important posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms occurred in one fifth of critical illness survivors at 1-year follow-up, with higher prevalence in those who had comorbid psychopathology, received benzodiazepines, and had early memories of frightening ICU experiences. In European studies, ICU diaries reduced posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms.

### Stress dynamics that maintain posttraumatic stress disorder across 20 years [^113oNTH2]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Stress-symptom dynamics and underlying maintenance mechanisms PTSD

One candidate dynamic is stress reactivity, which refers to how stressful events occurring after the initial trauma can exacerbate symptoms. Stressors may be especially potent for people with PTSD because of pre-trauma vulnerabilities associated with the condition (Brewin, Andrews, & Valentine; Chiu et al; Nievergelt et al.). Longitudinal studies of trauma-exposed populations support the role of stress reactivity, with many finding that post-trauma stressors predict subsequent increases in PTSD symptoms and that people exposed to more traumatic experiences are especially reactive (Galea et al; Lowe et al; Schmied, Larson, Highfill-McRoy, & Thomsen). Furthermore, according to stress sensitization models, trauma exposure may actually cause biological, cognitive, and behavioral changes that amplify responses to stressful life events (Post & Weiss). Some mechanisms that have been proposed to explain heightened reactivity after trauma include abnormalities in neurobiological systems involved with memory (Careaga, Girardi, & Suchecki; Foa, Steketee, & Rothbaum,), selective attention to threat (Ehlers & Clark,), and engagement in avoidant coping strategies that prevent adaptive fear conditioning (Seligowski, Lee, Bardeen, & Orcutt). In support of the possibility trauma contributes to stress reactivity, there is also evidence that the more traumatic events a person is exposed to, the more reactive they are to subsequent stressors (Smid et al; Zvolensky et al.). Thus, regardless of whether reactivity emerges before or after a trauma, PTSD pathology may be prolonged by the continual re-activation of symptoms in response to stressful life events.

### Posttraumatic stress disorder and its comorbidity with depression and somatisation in the elderly-a German community-based study [^116B66oN]. Aging & Mental Health (2012). Low credibility.

Objectives

Even 60 years after World War II, the German elderly population is significantly more often affected by posttraumatic symptomatology compared to the younger cohorts. This study is addressing prevalence rates of posttraumatic symptomatology and its comorbidity with depression and somatisation.

Methods

This study examines posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) according to DSM-IV, partial PTSD, depression and somatisation in a randomly selected sample of the German general population aged 60–85 years (N = 1.659) using self-rating instruments (Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ; Post Traumatic Diagnostic Scale, PTDS).

Results

One-month prevalence rate was 4.0% for DSM-IV PTSD; another 12.2% fulfilled the criteria of partial PTSD. A significant increase across the age groups was found for partial PTSD. 11.5% of the persons affected by posttraumatic symptomatology fulfil the criteria of a somatoform syndrome, 8.6% fulfil the criteria of major depression and 10.4% fulfil the criteria of other depressive syndromes according to the PHQ. A current posttraumatic symptomatology is associated with increased prevalence rates of somatoform and depressive disorders. Moreover, traumatic experiences without a current PTSD are associated with increased rates of somatoform disorders.

Conclusion

Posttraumatic symptomatology is a common phenomenon in the German elderly population. Especially, subsyndromal disorders are very common and increasing across the age groups. Posttraumatic symptomatology is associated with an increased risk of depressive and somatoform disorders. As posttraumatic symptoms are often neglected in geriatric health care, future effort should address the recognition and treatment of posttraumatic symptoms in elderly patients.

### Post-traumatic stress disorder after civilian traumatic brain injury: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prevalence rates [^116fTTj4]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2019). Medium credibility.

Time-point of measurement

The reported prevalence of PTSD measured at 3 and 6 months post-injury showed rates from 1.9 to 36.0%. and 0.0 to 33.3%, respectively. Six studies reported a percentage below 10%, 12 studies showed rates from 11 to 20%, four studies showed a percentage between 21 and 30%, and two studies measured a percentage above 30%. Measurements at 12 months post-injury showed rates varying from 2.6 to 21.4%. This does not decrease when adding measurements up to 5 years post-injury (2.4–22%). In five studies, the authors found rates up to 10%, 12 studies showed a rate of 11 to 20%, and one study reported a percentage of 21 to 30%.

Evidence suggests that prevalence remains relatively high even many years after injury. Nine studies performed follow-up assessments of PTSD up to 5 years post-injury. However, no discernible patterns were found in patients with TBI who were followed longitudinally. Over the first 6 months two studies showed worsening of symptoms of PTSD, two studies showed an improvement of the symptoms, and a larger study by Bryant and colleagues showed no change over time. For the next 6 months after injury (6 to 12 months) no clear increase or decrease of symptoms can be deducted. Four studies showed an increase in symptoms over time, three studies showed a decrease in symptoms, and two larger studies showed no change in symptoms. Ashman and associates reported a worsening after 12 months up to 2 years post-injury, but other studies showed improvement of symptoms of PTSD over time. The findings suggest that multiple factors need to be taken into account when drawing conclusions concerning prevalence rates and change over time.

### Posttraumatic stress disorder in disaster-exposed youth: examining diagnostic concordance and model fit using ICD-11 and DSM-5 criteria [^112gc7TX]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Trauma exposure is common in youth, with 60% experiencing a traumatic event, and 16% showing symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following exposure. The incidence of weather-related traumatic experiences is on the rise, increasing 81% from 1980 to 2022. Given the large number of youth affected by disasters, accurate screening and assessment of PTSD is essential for identifying psychological needs and triaging treatment resources post-disaster. However, major discrepancies exist for how PTSD is conceptualized and assessed. Competing definitions of PTSD have been proposed in the International Classification of Diseases, 11th edition (ICD-11) by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2019 and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) in 2013, with a text revision released in 2022. The DSM-5 criteria take a broad approach to PTSD with many symptoms (including symptoms shared with other disorders) across four symptom clusters, whereas the ICD-11 criteria focus on few symptoms considered central to PTSD with three symptom clusters. Although studies have estimated the impact of these changes using approximated forms of the diagnostic criteria (e.g.), there is a dearth of research using validated measures designed to assess the ICD-11 and DSM-5 PTSD criteria in youth. The purpose of this study is to address this gap in the literature by using validated measures to compare diagnostic rates and model fit between the ICD-11 and DSM-5 PTSD definitions. Furthermore, this study focuses on comparing parent-report measures, which are frequently used in research and clinical practice to provide collateral data on the child's symptoms.

### Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and alcohol and drug use comorbidity at 25 US level I trauma centers [^112HCj4C]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Beyond these considerations, the investigation has important implications for ACS-COT policy regarding mental health and substance use disorders. The ACS-COT has previously required alcohol screening and intervention at US level I and II trauma centers. Recent investigation has established widespread adherence among trauma centers nationally to the ACS-COT alcohol requirement. Orchestrated ACS-COT policy and trauma center service delivery development should incorporate the key finding that a substantial majority of patients with high levels of psychological distress (eg, elevated PTSD symptoms) may have alcohol and drug use comorbidities.

Module B: Management of Symptoms Persisting > 7 Days After Mild Traumatic Brain Injury outlines initial assessment, comorbidity evaluation, individualized treatment planning, education, and a decision pathway based on symptom persistence. Initial steps are to complete history and physical examination, including symptom attributes, intimate partner violence, neurologic and mental status exams, psychosocial evaluation, and suicide risk; evaluate for other conditions including but not limited to chronic pain, sleep disorders, depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and substance use disorder (SUD); develop and implement a patient-centered, individualized treatment plan for mTBI and other common co-occurring conditions by referring to recommendations from relevant VA/DoD CPGs; and educate patient/caregiver on symptoms and expected recovery. The decision point asks whether symptoms are persistent and functionally limiting 30 days after mTBI despite symptom-based treatment. If no, continue management as appropriate and monitor for comorbid conditions; if yes, initiate further symptom-based treatment (see Recommendations 10–16), consider consult and collaboration with a clinician with TBI experience, and then determine whether the treatment plan has been completed, proceeding to continue management as appropriate if yes or to consider case management with ongoing symptom-based primary care (see Sidebar 7) if no.

### Management of post-traumatic stress disorder in veterans and military service members: a review of pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic interventions since 2016 [^112RtYv4]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

It is vitally important that providers treating post-traumatic stress disorder continue to stay abreast of research advances in the treatment of this disorder. This article updates the reader about advances in research in PTSD treatment in the past four years as well as the evolving recommendations of clinical practice guidelines.

Recent Findings

One of the most important developments is that trauma-focused therapy (TFT) has emerged as the first-line treatment for PTSD with pharmacologic options often being noted as second-line or adjunctive. The quality and quantity of research into the treatment of PTSD continue to grow; however, the pace of research into treatment options lags behind our understanding of the development, course, and prognosis of the disorder. The development of new research-based evidence in the treatment of PTSD, both pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic, is needed and likely to necessitate frequent updates and re-evaluations of clinical practice guidelines.

### Outcomes of posttraumatic stress disorder [^112g5Ad5]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

The typical reaction to a life-threatening experience is one of distress, anxiety, and fear. This is characteristic of the basic survival instinct; these emotions enhance the individual's memory of the traumatic experience and thus serve to help in the recognition and avoidance of similarly dangerous situations in the future. In a significant minority of individuals, however, the natural reaction to trauma becomes uncontrollably and disastrously intensified, resulting in the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD varies in severity and duration between individuals, often relating to personal characteristics and the nature of the trauma to which a person is subjected. However, several factors, namely, chronicity, impairment, comorbidity, and somatization, are significantly related to and can influence the course of PTSD and subsequent outcome. This article briefly reviews each of these factors.

### Stress dynamics that maintain posttraumatic stress disorder across 20 years [^116L3iWf]. Psychological Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our study showed that individual differences in stress-symptom dynamics can explain and predict heterogeneity in the long-term course of PTSD. We propose that these patterns of stress and symptoms can eventually inform the development of clinical protocols tailored to the psychological mechanisms maintaining a person's problems. A mechanistically informed approach to classification and treatment can ultimately curb the chronicity and severity of PTSD and reduce economic burden on the individual and society.

Prevention of PTSD — selective prevention evidence in the immediate post-trauma period summarizes mixed findings across psychological and pharmacologic interventions. Individuals who experienced a Criterion A trauma were assigned to a modified PE group or a waitlist group within 72 hours of the event, and compared with waitlist controls, brief trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) significantly reduced the severity of PTSD symptoms as assessed by the PTSD Symptom Scale-I (PSS-I) at 4 and 12 weeks follow-up. Two blinded randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of Critical Incident Stress Debriefing (CISD) administered immediately after trauma exposure did not reduce the incidence of PTSD at 6-month follow-up compared with no debriefing. Early propranolol versus placebo in emergency department patients showed no difference in the likelihood of developing PTSD. In trials included in a systematic review, temazepam (within 3 weeks of trauma) and gabapentin (within 48 hours of trauma) versus placebo found no benefit. Hydrocortisone compared with placebo in acute inpatient medical settings during life-threatening medical illnesses was associated with significantly fewer PTSD symptoms at 3 months, but it is unclear whether these findings can be generalized to non-medical traumatic events or to a population without 100% medical comorbidity.

### Does COVID-19 count? defining criterion A trauma for diagnosing PTSD during a global crisis [^116YN2N7]. Depression and Anxiety (2021). Medium credibility.

1.2

Where does that leave us as clinician scientists?

As the field moves through empirical and phenomenological examinations of the COVID‐19 era, it is important that standards of classification be established and that this global stressor and its psychobiological effects are appropriately and soundly archived and interpreted. This sets a high bar for PTSD diagnosis and places innumerable cases under the umbrella of more broad diagnoses such as adjustment and "other specified trauma‐ and stress‐related" disorders (Van Overmeire). Our group recommends the use of structured, clinician‐administered interview as the basis for determining Criterion A exposure in addition to the widely used, established self‐rated measures. If self‐rated measures are used (e.g. PTSD Checklist for DSM‐5; PTSD checklist for DSM‐5 [PCL‐5]; Bovin et al.), we would strongly encourage using a version with a Criterion A assessment to allow a clearer determination whether a reported event meets Criterion A (Weathers et al.).

Many of the neuropsychosociaI manifestations observed with COVID‐19 and its associated fears overlap with acute stress disorder and mimic prodromal or subthreshold PTSD. This is not surprising given that PTSD as a clinical disorder lies at the extreme end of a spectrum of severity/impairment broadly defined as "stress reactions" and there are common neuro‐ and psycho‐biological consequences, and shared underlying neural mechanisms, with both stress and traumatic exposures. As a recent example, Na and colleagues reveal overlap between posttraumatic distress symptoms in individuals who experienced loss whether "violent" or "non‐violent". However, it is important to note that placement at this extreme end of a putative stress reaction spectrum requires the presence of a defined Criterion A trauma and severe symptoms.

With these considerations in mind, we are concerned that, instead of adhering to strict DSM‐5 criteria for PTSD, as we have proposed, some clinicians and investigators will utilize more liberal conceptualizations of post‐COVID distress and bypass a careful Criterion A assessment, altogether. For example, Shevlin and colleagues suggest that "living through the most deadly infectious respiratory disease pandemic since 1918" meets the guideline for an ICD‐11, but not DSM‐5‐defined, traumatic event and, as such, serves as an appropriate anchor point from which to launch COVID‐related mental health outcomes through a PTSD "lens". We disagree with the use this broad application of the definition of trauma.

### Rationale for a posttraumatic stress spectrum disorder [^114nSLqg]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

An understanding of PTSD and stress-related conditions is in its infancy. This is not surprising given the fact PTSD was not recognized as a distinct diagnostic entity until 1980. Since that time, the diagnostic classification has undergone continuous change as our understanding of PTSD is refined. The authors believe that PTSD can be best understood through a dimensional conceptualization viewed along at least three spectra: (1) symptom severity, (2) the nature of the stressor, and (3) responses to trauma. Along the severity spectrum, studies that review diagnostic thresholds reveal significant prevalence of PTSD symptoms and impairment that results from subthreshold conditions. Comorbidity patterns suggest that when PTSD is associated with other psychiatric illness, diagnosis is more difficult and the overall severity of PTSD is considerably greater. With regard to a stressor criteria spectrum, the diagnostic nomenclature initially only recognized severe forms of trauma personally experienced. More recently, however, the person's subjective response and events occurring to loved ones were included. This has greatly broadened the stressor criteria by leading to an appreciation of the range of precipitating stressors and the potential impact of "low-magnitude" events. Given that responses to trauma vary considerably, another possible spectrum includes trauma-related conditions. Traumatic grief, somatization, acute stress disorder and dissociation, personality disorders, depressive disorders, and other anxiety disorders all have significant associations with PTSD. Further research is needed to clarify and expand the current understanding of PTSD and other trauma-related conditions. Consideration of the severity of symptoms and the range of stressors coupled with the various disorders precipitated by trauma should greatly influence scientific research. The future undoubtedly will bring a refinement of the current understanding of PTSD and improved treatments.

### Posttraumatic stress disorder: evaluation and treatment [^1114sCEM]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common, with a lifetime prevalence of approximately 6%. PTSD may develop at least one month after a traumatic event involving the threat of death or harm to physical integrity, although earlier symptoms may represent an acute stress disorder. Symptoms typically involve trauma-related intrusive thoughts, avoidant behaviors, negative alterations of cognition or mood, and changes in arousal and reactivity. Assessing for past trauma in patients with anxiety or other psychiatric illnesses may aid in diagnosing and treating PTSD. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed., text revision provides diagnostic criteria, and the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 uses these diagnostic criteria to help physicians diagnose PTSD and determine severity. First-line treatment of PTSD involves psychotherapy, such as trauma-focused cognitive behavior therapy. Pharmacotherapy is useful for patients who have residual symptoms after psychotherapy or are unable or unwilling to access psychotherapy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (i.e., fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline) and the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine effectively treat primary PTSD symptoms. The addition of other pharmacotherapy, such as atypical antipsychotics or topiramate, may be helpful for residual symptoms. Patients with PTSD often have sleep disturbance related to hyperarousal or nightmares. Prazosin is effective for the treatment of PTSD-related sleep disturbance. Clinicians should consider testing patients with PTSD for obstructive sleep apnea because many patients with PTSD-related sleep disturbance have this condition. Psychiatric comorbidities, particularly mood disorders and substance use, are common in PTSD and are best treated concurrently.

### Summary of the clinical practice guideline for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in adults [^111v2Pds]. The American Psychologist (2019). High credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) guideline — evidence update and review currency — states that the Panel decided to conduct a second wave of updated searches and asked APA's library staff to conduct an updated search for systematic reviews and meta-analyses in PubMed, PsycNET, and Google Scholar for reviews published between January 1, 2023, and April 1, 2024, then narrowed the list and agreed to add six more reviews to determine whether the updated literature search would impact the recommendation statements. The page notes there was insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the specific interventions categorized as "other treatments reviewed". It further records that by finalization two of the 15 total underlying reviews will have crossed the 5-year mark for being considered a current review, and that the Panel completed its decision-making during the 5-year window in which each review was considered current.

### Guidelines for psychological practice with older adults [^114YTcUi]. The American Psychologist (2014). Medium credibility.

Older adults — anxiety disorders and symptom patterns — commonly experience anxiety problems with age-related fear content and presentations that may differ from younger adults, alongside frequent comorbidity and functional complications. Anxiety disorders are among the most commonly occurring mental health problems in older adults, and the patterns and content of presenting anxiety symptoms in older adults may differ from those of younger adults. The content of older adults' fears and worries tends to be age-related, such as health and economic concerns and fears of falling, and some have found that older adults with panic disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) exhibit patterns of symptoms (for example, fewer arousal symptoms, less avoidance, or more intrusive recollections) that differ from those of younger adults. While first onset of an anxiety disorder in older adults is uncommon, this is especially true for panic disorder and social anxiety disorder, whereas late onset is common for generalized anxiety disorder. Anxiety symptoms in older persons often co-exist with and may be difficult to distinguish from symptoms attributable to co-existing depression, medical problems, medications, or cognitive decline, and reciprocal relationships are observed in which anxiety following a medical stressor may significantly complicate fall risk and physical rehabilitation. Research shows that the common co-occurrence of anxiety with depression may slow treatment response for depressed older adults.

### PTSD in primary care – an update on evidence-based management [^115kgZMx]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common in primary care but it is frequently not detected or treated adequately. There is insufficient evidence to recommend universal screening for PTSD in primary care, but clinicians should remain alert to PTSD among patients exposed to trauma, and among those with other psychiatric disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, multiple somatic symptoms and chronic pain. A two-stage process of screening (involving the PC-PTSD), and, for those with a positive screen, a diagnostic evaluation (using the PTSD-Checklist), can detect most patients with PTSD with few false positives. Evidence-based recommendations are provided for treatment in primary care or referral to mental health.

### Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and alcohol and drug use comorbidity at 25 US level I trauma centers [^115zSD1X]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2022). Medium credibility.

During the course of the study, 171 303 trauma patients were admitted to the 25 US level I trauma center sites; 163 849 patients were not screened for the investigation. An additional 3256 patients were unable to undergo the study assessment (eg, cognitive impairment, non-English speaking). Seventeen hundred and six patients did not meet the EHR ≥ 3 domains positive screening criteria for the study and/or were excluded before consent was attempted. Eight hundred and eleven patients were discharged before consent was attempted; 617 patients declined to participate; 380 patients screened out of the study with a score of < 35 on the PTSD Checklist; 46 patients were unable to complete the baseline interview and 3 patients withdrew, leaving 635 patients who completed the baseline surgical ward interview with scores of ≥ 35 on the PTSD Checklist.

After obtaining patient written informed consent, research staff administered a baseline interview that began with the PTSD Checklist–Civilian (PCL-C) Version, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) assessment. Patients with elevated levels of PTSD symptom as indicated by a score of ≥ 35 or higher on the PCL-C completed the baseline interview. After completing all baseline measures, patients were entered into the longitudinal portion of the study and randomized. The current secondary analysis includes the baseline prerandomization data for 635 trauma surgical patients from the 25 sites with elevated PTSD symptom levels as indicated by a score of ≥ 35.

Measures

PTSD symptoms

The study's baseline interview used the 17-item PCL-C Version for the DSM-IV to assess initial PTSD symptom levels. The PTSD Checklist asks patients about the intrusive, avoidant, and arousal symptoms that constitute a DSM-IV diagnosis of PTSD. For the purposes of the current investigation, the PTSD Checklist items were anchored to the injury event. For example, patients were asked, 'Since you were injured, how bothered have you been by repeated, disturbing memories, thoughts, or images of the event… ?' The 17 items are asked on a 1 to 5 scale, with '1' being not at all and '5' being extremely bothered; the 17-item scale score ranges from 17 to 85. Prior study team investigations have established the reliability and validity of this measure when used with hospitalized traumatic injury survivors; these prior investigations have also established a cut-off score of ≥ 35 as optimally predictive of later development of a PTSD diagnosis.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for management of posttraumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder [^111qRT7H]. VA/DoD (2023). High credibility.

DSM-5-TR acute stress disorder diagnostic criteria — Criterion B requires presence of nine (or more) symptoms from any of the five categories (intrusion, negative mood, dissociation, avoidance, arousal) beginning or worsening after the traumatic event(s). Criterion C sets duration as 3 days to 1 month after trauma exposure and notes that symptoms typically begin immediately after the trauma but must persist for at least 3 days and up to 1 month to meet disorder criteria. Criterion D states the disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning, and Criterion E states it is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition and is not better explained by a brief psychotic disorder.

### Posttraumatic stress disorder: evaluation and treatment… [^114vDq2j]. AAFP (2023). Medium credibility.

Posttraumatic stress disorder is common, occurring in 6% of individuals. 1 It is often undetected in patients presenting to primary care. 2, 3 PTSD can occur in civilian and veteran populations in response to a broad range of traumatic events. PTSD affects people of all ages, and women are twice as likely to receive a diagnosis compared with men. 4 Symptoms of PTSD typically involve trauma-related intrusive thoughts, avoidant behaviors, negative alterations of cognition or mood, and changes in arousal and reactivity. 5 Two-thirds of patients with PTSD report moderate to severe symptoms. 2 PTSD may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and other medical conditions commonly seen in primary care.
6. 8 The pathophysiology of PTSD appears to involve impairment in traumatic memory consolidation, leading to maladaptive neuropsychological responses.

9 Patients often report reexperiencing their trauma, which triggers physiologic and psychological responses that present as primary symptoms of the disorder. Although trauma is common, affecting one-half of adults, less than 10% of patients with traumatic experiences develop PTSD. Prevention Although intervention after trauma is an opportunity to prevent PTSD, there is no consensus on how to prevent PTSD for patients with traumatic exposures. A single session debriefing is not effective at preventing PTSD development. Diagnosis of PTSD Table 1 lists the DSM-5-TR criteria for PTSD. 5 Trauma exposure is the hallmark criterion of PTSD. Traumas vary, but interpersonal violence, such as sexual assault, physical assault, or military combat, is most likely to lead to PTSD development. 19 Patients do not need to have experienced the trauma directly to meet the criteria. Indirect exposure by witnessing an event or exposure to details of an event can be sufficiently traumatic.

Criteria B, C, D, and E organize the symptoms of PTSD. Persistent psychological impairments include hyperarousal, avoidance, intrusive thinking, and negative cognition or mood related to the past traumatic experience. Many patients with PTSD have sleep impairment, and symptoms typically present as difficulty falling or staying asleep and sleep disturbances, including nightmares. Treatment of Psychological Symptoms PSYCHOTHERAPY Table 2 presents an overview of PTSD treatment. Psychotherapy is the preferred initial treatment for PTSD and should be offered to all patients. 25–28 Trauma-focused psychotherapies have high-quality empirical support in the literature and show a superior reduction in PTSD symptoms with a large effect size compared with pharmacotherapy or non–trauma-focused therapies.

### Post-traumatic stress disorder in children | CDC… [^115kAAnh]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Post-traumatic Stress Disorder in Children All children may experience very stressful events that affect how they think and feel. Most of the time, children recover quickly and well. However, sometimes children who experience severe stress, such as from an injury, from the death or threatened death of a close family member or friend, or from violence, will be affected long-term. The child could experience this trauma directly or could witness it happening to someone else. When children develop long term symptoms from such stress, which are upsetting or interfere with their relationships and activities, they may be diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder.

Examples of PTSD symptoms include
- Reliving the event over and over in thought or in play
- Nightmares and sleep problems
- Becoming very upset when something causes memories of the event
- Lack of positive emotions
- Intense ongoing fear or sadness
- Irritability and angry outbursts
- Constantly looking for possible threats, being easily startled
- Acting helpless, hopeless or withdrawn
- Denying that the event happened or feeling numb
- Avoiding places or people associated with the event. Because children who have experienced traumatic stress may seem restless, fidgety, or have trouble paying attention and staying organized, the symptoms of traumatic stress can be confused with symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Read a guide for clinicians on deciding if it is ADHD or child traumatic stress.

Examples of events that could cause PTSD include
- Physical, sexual, or emotional maltreatment
- Being a victim or witness to violence or crime
- Serious illness or death of a close family member or friend
- Natural or manmade disasters
- Severe car accidents. Once the diagnosis is made, the first step is to make the child feel safe by getting support from parents, friends, and school, and by minimizing the chance of another traumatic event to the extent possible. Psychotherapy in which the child can speak, draw, play, or write about the stressful event can be done with the child, the family, or a group. Behavior therapy, specifically cognitive-behavioral therapy, helps children learn to change thoughts and feelings by first changing behavior in order to reduce the fear or worry. Medication may also be used to decrease symptoms.
