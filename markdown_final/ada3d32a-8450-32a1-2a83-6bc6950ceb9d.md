## Question

Calcitriol alternative that can be crushed

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a calcitriol alternative that can be crushed. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about why calcitriol itself cannot be crushed and whether any oral calcitriol formulations are crushable. Then, I should verify which alternative vitamin D therapies are available in oral forms that can be safely crushed or otherwise manipulated for dysphagia. Next, I will review the clinical contexts where calcitriol is used and whether those alternatives are appropriate substitutes. Finally, I will synthesize practical, safety-conscious recommendations and confirm dosing and monitoring considerations, including any exceptions or caveats that might change the plan.

> Let me first confirm the core issue with calcitriol. Calcitriol is available as 0.25 mcg and 0.5 mcg capsules and as a 1 mcg/mL oral solution; the capsules are not designed to be crushed, and the oral solution is the only liquid option, which already addresses swallowing difficulties without manipulation of solid dosage forms [^111FYEm4] [^111FYEm4].

> Wait, let me verify whether any calcitriol capsule is crushable. I initially thought there might be a soft-gel or sprinkle formulation, but on review, the FDA listings consistently show calcitriol capsules as solid oral dosage forms without crush-friendly designations, so crushing calcitriol capsules is not recommended and could lead to dose inaccuracy or exposure issues; the appropriate non-crushable route is the oral solution when swallowing is a problem [^111FYEm4] [^111FYEm4].

> Next, I should review alternatives that are clinically appropriate and available in crushable or liquid forms. Native vitamin D (cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol) is available as chewable tablets, liquids, and powders, and these are appropriate to treat 25(OH)D deficiency in CKD and other settings; importantly, they are not substitutes for calcitriol when the indication is impaired 1-α-hydroxylation or when rapid PTH suppression is needed, but they are valid alternatives when the goal is correcting 25(OH)D deficiency or maintaining vitamin D status [^115ZQDVm] [^112Tpe7y] [^1161zy5c].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about calcitriol's role. I need to check guideline positions so I don't overstate calcitriol use. In non-dialysis CKD, KDIGO advises against routine calcitriol or vitamin D analogs; they should be reserved for severe and progressive secondary hyperparathyroidism, whereas native vitamin D should be used to correct 25(OH)D deficiency, which supports choosing cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol when the clinical problem is low 25(OH)D rather than calcitriol-responsive SHPT [^114bjuBm] [^115ZQDVm].

> I will now examine active vitamin D analogs for crushability. Paricalcitol is available as soft gelatin capsules that are not intended to be crushed; doxercalciferol is available in oral and IV forms, but the oral product is a soft capsule and should not be crushed; cinacalcet is an oral tablet that must be swallowed whole and not crushed, so it is not a crushable alternative either [^116Ywiya] [^1178pCDh].

> Let me consider the special case of hypoparathyroidism, where calcitriol is often used to maintain serum calcium. In that context, if a patient cannot swallow capsules, the calcitriol oral solution is the appropriate non-crushable formulation; if a crushable alternative is absolutely necessary, some clinicians use crushed alfacalcidol (a prodrug activated in the liver) as a practical workaround, but I should confirm that this is off-label manipulation and requires careful dose conversion and monitoring, so I need to be explicit about that caveat.

> But wait, what if the indication is topical psoriasis rather than systemic mineral metabolism. Calcitriol ointment is a topical option for mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis; if the issue is skin sensitivity or tolerability rather than swallowing, calcipotriene is an alternative topical vitamin D analog with multiple formulations, though this does not address a need for a crushable oral product [^112wg9X3] [^114HoGDv].

> I should double-check safety and monitoring when substituting or manipulating formulations. Whether using native vitamin D or active vitamin D analogs, serum calcium, phosphate, and PTH should be monitored periodically, and patients should be counseled on hypercalcemia symptoms; this is especially critical if any dose form is altered or if multiple vitamin D compounds are used concurrently [^1165AX1e] [^114QXVYk].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the recommendation is precise. There is no approved crushable oral calcitriol product; when a crushable alternative is needed, the appropriate substitute depends on the clinical indication: for 25(OH)D deficiency or maintenance, use cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol in chewable, liquid, or powder forms; for calcitriol-responsive indications where a liquid is acceptable, use the calcitriol oral solution; for hypoparathyroidism when a capsule must be crushed, some clinicians use alfacalcidol with caution and close monitoring, recognizing this is off-label manipulation and requires careful dose equivalence and safety checks [^115ZQDVm].

Calcitriol capsules **cannot be crushed** because they are soft gelatin capsules containing liquid [^111FYEm4]; crushing would cause dose loss and erratic absorption. For patients who cannot swallow capsules, **liquid calcitriol** is the preferred alternative, as it allows accurate dosing and is safe to use [^111FYEm4]. If liquid calcitriol is unavailable, **compounded calcitriol suspension** can be used with pharmacist guidance. Do not substitute with over-the-counter vitamin D (cholecalciferol or ergocalciferol) for calcitriol-specific indications, as these are not equivalent and will not provide the same therapeutic effect [^112Tpe7y].

---

## Why calcitriol capsules cannot be crushed

Calcitriol capsules are **soft gelatin capsules** containing liquid calcitriol; crushing them would cause leakage, dose loss, and inconsistent absorption, risking under- or overdosing [^111FYEm4]. The FDA labeling does not provide crushing instructions, reinforcing that capsules should be swallowed whole.

---

## Alternative formulations of calcitriol

When patients cannot swallow capsules, **consider these alternatives**:

| **Formulation** | **Description** | **Availability** | **Administration considerations** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Liquid calcitriol | Oral solution allowing precise dosing | Commercially available | - Preferred alternative <br/> - Use oral syringe or dropper for accuracy |
| Compounded calcitriol suspension | Pharmacist-prepared liquid suspension | Available via compounding pharmacies | - Use if commercial liquid is unavailable <br/> - Ensure accurate dosing and stability |

---

## Clinical considerations when switching formulations

When switching from capsules to liquid or compounded suspension, **clinicians should**:

- **Monitor serum calcium and phosphate**: Calcitriol increases intestinal calcium and phosphate absorption; monitor closely to avoid hypercalcemia or hyperphosphatemia [^114QXVYk].

- **Adjust dosing carefully**: Liquid formulations allow fine titration; adjust to maintain target calcium and PTH levels [^112Tpe7y].

- **Educate patients and caregivers**: Ensure proper use of dosing devices and adherence to monitoring schedules [^1165AX1e].

---

## Safety concerns with crushing calcitriol capsules

Crushing calcitriol capsules can cause **dose inconsistency**, leading to under- or overdosing and increasing the risk of hypercalcemia or hypocalcemia. It may also cause **medication loss** through leakage, reducing therapeutic effect and potentially worsening disease control.

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing alternative selection

Alternative selection should be **individualized** based on:

- **Age and swallowing ability**: Liquid or compounded suspensions are preferred for pediatric, geriatric, or dysphagic patients.

- **Comorbidities**: Hypercalcemia, renal impairment, or cardiac disease may influence dosing and monitoring [^114QXVYk].

- **Patient preference and adherence**: Ease of administration and patient acceptance are critical for adherence [^114fRTyM].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **individualized therapy** and close monitoring when switching formulations. Liquid calcitriol is the preferred alternative when capsules cannot be swallowed, and compounded suspensions are acceptable when the commercial liquid is unavailable. Routine crushing of calcitriol capsules is not recommended due to dose inconsistency and safety concerns.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Calcitriol capsules **should not be crushed** due to their liquid-filled soft gelatin formulation. Liquid calcitriol is the preferred alternative for patients who cannot swallow capsules, with compounded suspensions as a secondary option. Clinicians should monitor calcium and phosphate closely, adjust dosing carefully, and educate patients to ensure safe and effective therapy.

Vitamin D formulations and cautions — injectable vitamin D is an excellent option for stoss therapy but is no longer commercially available, though it has been successfully prepared by local compounding pharmacies when necessary. Calcitriol is not preferred for stoss therapy, is expensive, has a short half-life, and does not build up vitamin D stores; its use in nutritional deficiency of vitamin D is limited to treating associated hypocalcemia alone, and when given in large doses may cause hypercalcemia because of its rapid onset of action. Similarly, dihydrotachysterol can only treat hypocalcemia associated with vitamin D deficiency but does not build up vitamin D stores. Increased 1-α-hydroxylase activity from high PTH levels in the second phase of rickets may cause transient hypercalcemia after vitamin D treatment because of elevation of 1,25(OH)2-D levels to well above the upper limit of the reference range.

Treatment of Accidental Overdosage of calcitriol capsules

The treatment of acute accidental overdosage of calcitriol should consist of general supportive measures. If drug ingestion is discovered within a relatively short time, induction of emesis or gastric lavage may be of benefit in preventing further absorption. If the drug has passed through the stomach, the administration of mineral oil may promote its fecal elimination. Serial serum electrolyte determinations (especially calcium), rate of urinary calcium excretion, and assessment of electrocardiographic abnormalities due to hypercalcemia should be obtained. Such monitoring is critical in patients receiving digitalis. Discontinuation of supplemental calcium and a low-calcium diet are also indicated in accidental overdosage. Due to the relatively short duration of the pharmacological action of calcitriol, further measures are probably unnecessary. Should, however, persistent and markedly elevated serum calcium levels occur, there are a variety of therapeutic alternatives which may be considered, depending on the patient's underlying condition. These include the use of drugs such as phosphates and corticosteroids as well as measures to induce an appropriate forced diuresis. The use of peritoneal dialysis against a calcium-free dialysate has also been reported.

Calcitriol

Calcitriol is the active hormonal form of vitamin D and the natural VDR ligand. It promotes active intestinal calcium absorption and suppresses PTH secretion. Calcitriol has a short half-life of around 5 to 8 hours; therefore, it should be administered daily (or with intermittent regimens) and sometimes in lower doses distributed over a 24-hour period. As calcitriol is not an organic micronutrient, its use in clinical practice requires careful monitoring. Calcitriol increases the activity of CYP24A1, which stimulates the degradation of 25(OH)D. This results in serum 25(OH)D not being useful as a marker of adequate vitamin D supplementation and reduced potential benefits of physiological extrarenal/local production of calcitriol due to reduced substrate availability. Moreover, some studies have reported a more significant incidence of adverse events such as hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria. Thus, there is a need to monitor serum and urine calcium and phosphate. Because of these safety and clinical practicality issues, there is consensus that calcitriol use should be limited to hormone replacement for patients with limited/absent renal tubular 1-α-hydroxylase activity, as their capacity to produce calcitriol is severely limited. Indeed, calcitriol was first used to treat patients with vitamin D–resistant rickets type 1. Other indications are X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets, chronic hypoparathyroidism, as an alternative to the use of the native missing hormone PTH, and moderate-to-severe kidney failure when calcitriol production is impaired or to suppress excessive PTH secretion. This use helps to control secondary hyperparathyroidism and resultant metabolic bone diseases. However, as calcitriol use is associated with frequent hypercalcemia, its use could be replaced by analogues with less calcemic activity approved for use in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism in renal failure, in particular maxacalcitol (22-oxa-1,25(OH) 2 D 3) and falecalcitriol (1,25(OH) 2–26,27-F6-D 3), which are currently available in Japan, and paricalcitol (19-nor-1,25(OH) 2 D 2) and doxercalciferol (1α(OH)D2), available in the United States. Calcitriol has also been proposed for the treatment of osteoporosis, but it is not approved in this setting.

### Exploring vitamin D metabolism and function in cancer [^113J8EoB]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Vitamin D-based cancer therapy: future directions

Although randomized clinical trial data are still lacking, several epidemiological, clinical, preclinical, and in vitro experimental data strongly suggest that the activation of vitamin D signaling could be a promising strategy for prevention, as well as treatment of many types of cancer. As such, several therapeutic interventions targeting dysregulated vitamin D metabolism or activity have been investigated and developed for cancer therapy. However, there are some potential limitations of vitamin D-based cancer therapy, which should be taken into consideration to design better therapeutic strategies.

One potential caveat of systemic activation of vitamin D signaling would be the high risk of hypercalcemia, which can result in serious detrimental health effects. To minimize the hypercalcemic effect, many efforts are currently being directed to develop biased agonists of VDR that have little effect on inducing hypercalcemia while retaining anticancer activities comparable to those of calcitriol –. To date, nearly 1500 vitamin D analogs have been tested for such effects, but only a few among those compounds have been approved for further evaluation in clinical trials in patients with leukemia, breast, prostate, and colon cancers. Moreover, the metabolites produced from the CYP11A1-driven alternative vitamin D metabolism pathway have been shown to be a biased agonist of VDR with less calcemic effect while retaining anti-proliferative properties in cancer comparable to those of calcitriol. As the alternative vitamin D metabolism pathway via CYP11A1 is just beginning to be understood, its role in cancer and the relative contributions of VDR and ROR are largely unknown. Thus, intensive research on the alternative vitamin D metabolism pathway and successful application of this pathway for cancer therapy is warranted in the future. In addition, increasing local concentrations of calcitriol in cancer cells would be another strategy to avoid the hypercalcemic effect of calcitriol. As a calcitriol degrading enzyme, CYP24A1 is frequently overexpressed in many cancers; the inhibition of CYP24A1 can increase local concentrations of calcitriol in cancer cells. Indeed, recent studies showed that inhibition of CYP24A1 by genetic knockdown or pharmacological inhibition greatly sensitized the anticancer effect of calcitriol. So far, several CYP24A1-specific inhibitors have been developed for clinical purposes and it remains to be seen whether any of these will be used for cancer therapy with suitable clinical effectiveness and safety.

KDIGO 2017 CKD-MBD — risk–benefit rationale for calcitriol or vitamin D analogs emphasizes hypercalcemia risk without cardiac benefit and limits use to severe, progressive SHPT. Two trials "demonstrated a significantly increased risk of hypercalcemia in patients treated with paricalcitol, compared with placebo, in the absence of beneficial effects on surrogate cardiac endpoints", leading the Work Group to state that "the use of calcitriol or vitamin D analogs should be reserved for only severe and progressive SHPT". The key evidence for changes in Recommendation 4.2.2 predominantly came from these trials.

EXTENDED-RELEASE CALCIFEDIOL (ERC) AS A FUTURE OPTION?

As already pointed out above, prevention of early autonomy of SHPT and good PTH control at the time of transfer of ND-CKD patients into the dialysis stage appears to be of great importance. Both native vitamin supplementation (due to its limited effect on PTH levels) and active vitamin D treatment (due to its inherent risk of hypercalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia) have been suboptimal options in this regard.

ERC was approved in the USA in 2016 and may become an interesting alternative treatment option for ND-CKD patients in stages G3–G4 who develop progressive SHPT. ERC is an orally administered prohormone of calcitriol in an extended (or prolonged) release formulation. This formulation creates specific pharmacokinetic properties — as a consequence, a slow and steady release of calcifediol over its full intestinal transport confers a steady low-level uptake of the prohormone. Therefore ERC does not cause peaks of 25(OH)D and calcitriol levels, avoiding the induction and upregulation of 24-hydroxylases and thus overcoming rapid inactivation and degradation, especially of subsequently and constantly rising calcitriol concentrations. By this kind of substrate availability, endogenous calcitriol remains in charge of vitamin D receptor activation in target tissues to a much greater degree than otherwise possible in these stages of CKD, effectively contributing to suppressing PTH synthesis and secretion by the parathyroid glands.

### Paricalcitol [^116zi2Mn]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

10 OVERDOSAGE

Excessive administration of paricalcitol capsules can cause hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia, and over suppression of PTH [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

Treatment of Overdosage

The treatment of acute overdosage of paricalcitol capsules should consist of general supportive measures. If drug ingestion is discovered within a relatively short time, induction of emesis or gastric lavage may be of benefit in preventing further absorption. If the drug has passed through the stomach, the administration of mineral oil may promote its fecal elimination. Serial serum electrolyte determinations (especially calcium), rate of urinary calcium excretion, and assessment of electrocardiographic abnormalities due to hypercalcemia should be obtained. Such monitoring is critical in patients receiving digitalis. Discontinuation of supplemental calcium and institution of a low-calcium diet are also indicated in accidental overdosage. Due to the relatively short duration of the pharmacological action of paricalcitol, further measures are probably unnecessary. If persistent and markedly elevated serum calcium levels occur, there are a variety of therapeutic alternatives that may be considered depending on the patient's underlying condition. These include the use of drugs such as phosphates and corticosteroids, as well as measures to induce an appropriate forced diuresis.

Paricalcitol is not significantly removed by dialysis.

### Steroid responsive idiopathic calcitriol induced hypercalcemia: a case report and review of the literature [^117QEbk6]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Calcitriol plays a key role in calcium homeostasis. Systemically, calcitriol binds to vitamin-D receptors in the kidneys, parathyroid glands, intestines, and bones to raise serum blood calcium levels by facilitating intestinal absorption, renal tubular reabsorption, and bone release. The calcium-binding protein encoded by the transcription factor calcitriol carries both calcium and phosphate ions concurrently through intestinal epithelial cells. By stimulating osteoclasts via the release of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL) from osteoblasts, calcitriol promotes bone resorption. By causing apoptosis, calcitriol dramatically reduces the growth of T lymphocytes and normal human epidermal keratinocytes. Through this distinct array of self-regulatory mechanisms, calcitriol increases serum calcium levels. Therefore, elevated calcitriol levels idiopathically will lead to hypercalcemia that is resistant to feedback pathways that usually reduce parathyroid hormone production and decreases calcium levels. Corticosteroids inhibit the production of calcitriol in macrophages, which reduces gut absorption of calcium, RANKL expression, and would theoretically promote bone retention reducing calcium levels overall. However, in reality, long term use of glucocorticoids can result in a variety of side effects including bone weakening. Glucocorticoid can activate osteoclast first, later can inhibit osteoblast, which can cause osteoporosis, fractures and osteonecrosis. Long term medium or high dose glucocorticoid use can cause cushingoid facial features, buffalo hump, induce refractory hyperglycemia or worsen existing diabetes, increase risk of infection, and cause a variety of other harmful effects. Titrating the steroid dosage to ensure symptoms do not return, while minimizing the overall steroid burden can be difficult. Yet, this down titration process is necessary to ensure appropriate treatment of Idiopathic Calcitriol Induced Hypercalcemia while minimizing unintended consequences. While the patient continues steroid therapy, it is necessary to monitor for long-term toxicity associated with this treatment. For instance, bone mineral density (BMD) will need to be monitored one year after steroid initiation with appropriate follow-up screening every two years if BMD is stable. In addition to BMD, other parameters that require surveillance with long-term steroid use include lipids, glucose parameters, and intraocular pressures. Authors are considering alternative management in the future. One such alternative is to trial Mycophenolate mofetil, an immunosuppressive agent that has been effective in the treatment of Sarcoidosis.

### New vitamin D analogs and changing therapeutic paradigms [^114fT19E]. Kidney International (2011). Low credibility.

Vitamin D compounds have been used successfully to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism for almost three decades. Side effects of increased levels of serum calcium and phosphate and potential complications have increasingly been recognized as problematic, and this has become an even more difficult clinical challenge with the desire to capitalize on some of the pleiotropic effects of vitamin D. Nonclassical nuclear vitamin D receptor (VDR) effects on the cardiovascular system, kidneys, and immune system, with the prospect of improved patient survival, have moved to center stage. Selective vitamin D compounds with minimal effects on mineral metabolism and with maximal cardiovascular and renal benefits are now needed. New vitamin D compounds already in clinical use, which have an improved side-effect profile and differential nonclassical effects compared with calcitriol, are limited to the three licensed pharmaceuticals — paricalcitol, 22-oxacalcitriol, and doxercalciferol. Other compounds are under early development and it is anticipated that these novel therapeutic concepts will result in new vitamin D therapies that will help to reduce the high mortality rate patients with kidney disease experience.

### Cinacalcet (cinacalcet hydrochloride) [^116Ywiya]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

2.1 Administration

Cinacalcet tablets should be taken with food or shortly after a meal.

Cinacalcet tablets are administered orally and should always be taken whole and not chewed, crushed, or divided.

2.2 Secondary Hyperparathyroidism in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease on Dialysis

The recommended starting oral dose of cinacalcet tablets is 30 mg once daily. Serum calcium and serum phosphorus should be measured within 1 week and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) should be measured 1 to 4 weeks after initiation or dose adjustment of cinacalcet tablets [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)]. Cinacalcet tablets should be titrated no more frequently than every 2 to 4 weeks through sequential doses of 30 mg, 60 mg, 90 mg, 120 mg, and 180 mg once daily to target iPTH levels of 150 to 300 pg/mL. Serum iPTH levels should be assessed no earlier than 12 hours after dosing with cinacalcet tablets.

Cinacalcet tablets can be used alone or in combination with vitamin D sterols and/or phosphate binders.

During dose titration, serum calcium levels should be monitored frequently and if levels decrease below the normal range, appropriate steps should be taken to increase serum calcium levels, such as by providing supplemental calcium, initiating or increasing the dose of calcium-based phosphate binder, initiating or increasing the dose of vitamin D sterols, or temporarily withholding treatment with cinacalcet tablets [see Dosage and Administration (2.3) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

2.3 Patients with Parathyroid Carcinoma and Primary Hyperparathyroidism

The recommended starting oral dose of cinacalcet tablets is 30 mg twice daily.

The dose of cinacalcet tablets should be titrated every 2 to 4 weeks through sequential doses of 30 mg twice daily, 60 mg twice daily, and 90 mg twice daily, and 90 mg 3 or 4 times daily as necessary to normalize serum calcium levels. Serum calcium should be measured within 1 week after initiation or dose adjustment of cinacalcet tablets [see Dosage and Administration (2.5) and Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

CKD–MBD, non–dialysis-dependent CKD (adult and pediatric) — use of calcitriol or vitamin D analogs: In adult patients with CKD G3a-G5 not on dialysis, we suggest that calcitriol and vitamin D analogs not be routinely used (2C), and it is reasonable to reserve the use of calcitriol and vitamin D analogs for patients with CKD G4-G5 with severe and progressive hyperparathyroidism (Not Graded). In children, calcitriol and vitamin D analogs may be considered. The KDOQI work group agrees that low doses of calcitriol or active vitamin D analogues could be initiated in patients with elevated and increasing PTH levels with close monitoring, and expresses concern that less aggressive attention to PTH levels may lead to increased rates of tertiary hyperparathyroidism and need for parathyroidectomy or more use of expensive medications later in CKD.

WARNINGS

Overdosage of any form of vitamin D is dangerous (see OVERDOSAGE). Progressive hypercalcemia due to overdosage of vitamin D and its metabolites may be so severe as to require emergency attention. Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification, nephrocalcinosis and other soft-tissue calcification. The serum calcium times phosphate (Ca x P) product should not be allowed to exceed 70 mg /dL. Radiographic evaluation of suspect anatomical regions may be useful in the early detection of this condition.

Calcitriol is the most potent metabolite of vitamin D available. The administration of calcitriol to patients in excess of their daily requirements can cause hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and hyperphosphatemia. Therefore, pharmacologic doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during calcitriol treatment to avoid possible additive effects and hypercalcemia. If treatment is switched from ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) to calcitriol, it may take several months for the ergocalciferol level in the blood to return to the baseline value (see OVERDOSAGE).

Calcitriol increases inorganic phosphate levels in serum. While this is desirable in patients with hypophosphatemia, caution is called for in patients with renal failure because of the danger of ectopic calcification. A non-aluminum phosphate-binding compound and a low-phosphate diet should be used to control serum phosphorus levels in patients undergoing dialysis.

Magnesium-containing preparations (eg, antacids) and calcitriol should not be used concomitantly in patients on chronic renal dialysis because such use may lead to the development of hypermagnesemia.

Studies in dogs and rats given calcitriol for up to 26 weeks have shown that small increases of calcitriol above endogenous levels can lead to abnormalities of calcium metabolism with the potential for calcification of many tissues in the body.

### Calcitriol capsule, liquid filled rocaltrol… [^111FYEm4]. FDA (DailyMed) (2006). Low credibility.

3, FD&C Yellow No. 6 and titanium dioxide. The oral solution contains no additional adjuvants or coloring principles. Calcitriol is a white, crystalline compound which occurs naturally in humans. It has a calculated molecular weight of 416. 65 and is soluble in organic solvents but relatively insoluble in water. Chemically, calcitriol is 9, 10- seco-5, 7, 10-cholestatriene-1α, 3β, 25-triol and has the following structural formula: The kidneys of uremic patients cannot adequately synthesize calcitriol, the active hormone formed from precursor vitamin D. Resultant hypocalcemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism are a major cause of the metabolic bone disease of renal failure. However, other bone-toxic substances which accumulate in uremia may also contribute. Metabolism In vivo and in vitro studies indicate the presence of two pathways of metabolism for calcitriol. The first pathway involves the 24-hydroxylase as the first step in catabolism of calcitriol.

There is definite evidence of 24-hydroxylase activity in the kidney; this enzyme is also present in many target tissues which possess the vitamin D receptor such as the intestine. The end product of this pathway is a side chain shortened metabolite, calcitroic acid. The second pathway involves the conversion of calcitriol via the stepwise hydroxylation of carbon-26 and carbon-23, and cyclization to yield ultimately 1α, 25R2-26, 23S-lactone D3. Calcitriol increases inorganic phosphate levels in serum. While this is desirable in patients with hypophosphatemia, caution is called for in patients with renal failure because of the danger of ectopic calcification. A non-aluminum phosphate-binding compound and a low-phosphate diet should be used to control serum phosphorus levels in patients undergoing dialysis. Due to the relatively short duration of the pharmacological action of calcitriol, further measures are probably unnecessary.

Should, however, persistent and markedly elevated serum calcium levels occur, there are a variety of therapeutic alternatives which may be considered, depending on the patient's underlying condition. These include the use of drugs such as phosphates and corticosteroids as well as measures to induce an appropriate forced diuresis. The use of peritoneal dialysis against a calcium-free dialysate has also been reported.

### Steroid responsive idiopathic calcitriol induced hypercalcemia: a case report and review of the literature [^115tdfTA]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

The first report discussing idiopathic calcitriol induced hypercalcemia emerged in 1994, where Kreisberg explored all the possible etiologies of hypercalcemia and appropriate workups through clinical problem-solving. He never found a definitive diagnosis, and his patient improved on low dose prednisone that was continued long-term. Evron et al. subsequently coined the term idiopathic calcitriol induced hypercalcemia suggesting it as a possible diagnosis for three patients they treated. Their patients presented with low iPTH, high calcitriol and high ACE levels. After finding no evidence of Sarcoidosis and normalization of calcium levels post prednisone treatment, they suggested term idiopathic calcitriol induced hypercalcemia as a separate disease entity. Rijckborst et al. consolidated the diagnosis further describing one patient with low iPTH, high calcitriol and high ACE levels. Their patient also underwent a robust investigative workup demonstrating no clear etiology that could explain the observed hypercalcemia. Their patient also responded to prednisone but required a low maintenance dose to prevent disease recurrence. Our patient's presentation and treatment course differ from those previously reported in respect to ACE levels. Elevated ACE levels in previous case reports lead them to postulate alternation in macrophage function as a possible underlying mechanism for idiopathic calcitriol induced hypercalcemia. Low ACE levels in our patient might emphasize the need to look for alternative causes that could explain elevated calcitriol and calcium levels. Additionally, our case report outlines a case of specific recurrent nephrolithiasis from a young age. Although idiopathic calcitriol induced hypercalcemia is not generally associated with nephrolithiasis, previous history of kidney stone can explain the susceptibility of nephrolithiasis in the setting of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria.

The kidneys of uremic patients cannot adequately synthesize calcitriol, the active hormone formed from precursor vitamin D.

The end product of this pathway is a side chain shortened metabolite, calcitroic acid.

The second pathway involves the conversion of calcitriol via the stepwise hydroxylation of carbon-26 and carbon-23, and cyclization to yield ultimately lα, 25R 2–26, 23S-lactone D 3. The elimination half-life of calcitriol in serum after single oral doses is about 5 to 8 hours in normal subjects. Renal Insufficiency Lower predose and peak calcitriol levels in serum were observed in patients with nephrotic syndrome and in patients undergoing hemodialysis compared with healthy subjects. The elimination half-life of calcitriol increased by at least twofold in chronic renal failure and hemodialysis patients compared with healthy subjects. Peak serum levels in patients with nephrotic syndrome were reached in 4 hours. For patients requiring hemodialysis peak serum levels were reached in 8 to 12 hours; half-lives were estimated to be 16. 2 and
21. 9 hours, respectively. Patients with normal renal function taking calcitriol should avoid dehydration.

Adequate fluid intake should be maintained. Due to the relatively short duration of the pharmacological action of calcitriol, further measures are probably unnecessary. Should, however, persistent and markedly elevated serum calcium levels occur, there are a variety of therapeutic alternatives which may be considered, depending on the patient's underlying condition. These include the use of drugs such as phosphates and corticosteroids as well as measures to induce an appropriate forced diuresis.

Introduction

Vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency are common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), owing to decreased synthesis of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D) in the kidney. A decrease in 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, along with an increase in parathyroid hormone, is one of the earliest changes seen in mineral metabolism parameters in patients with CKD and this decrease tends to worsen as CKD progresses. Vitamin D insufficiency is strongly associated with hyperparathyroidism, as well as an increased risk of cardiovascular events and changes in bone metabolism. The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative and the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes guidelines both recommend that vitamin D insufficiency and deficiency are treated appropriately. Several preparations of vitamin D and vitamin D analogues are available; some are administered orally and others intravenously. Such agents have been found to be extremely effective in controlling hyperparathyroidism in patients with advanced kidney disease and in reducing mortality in patients on haemodialysis. Thus, it is important for nephrologists to be aware of any drug–drug interactions that may impact on the effectiveness of vitamin D treatments.

Vitamin D analogues for psoriasis — efficacy and randomized controlled trial (RCT) results indicate that calcipotriene (also known as calcipotriol) and calcitriol are the 2 commonly used synthetic vitamin D analogues, with calcipotriene available in several formulations in the US and topical calcitriol only as an ointment; several studies have shown that 4 to 8 weeks' treatment with calcipotriene, calcitriol, tacalcitol, and maxacalcitol is safe and efficacious for treating mild to moderate psoriasis; in two double-blind RCTs of calcipotriene foam versus vehicle for plaque psoriasis, treatment success after 8 weeks was 14% vs 7% (P = 0.058) in the first study and 27% vs 16% (P = 0.016) in the second; a 6-week double-blind RCT in 258 patients found calcitriol ointment had comparable mean PASI reduction to betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% ointment (10.6% and 9.67%, respectively), and during follow-up 48% of calcipotriol-treated versus 25% of betamethasone dipropionate–treated patients remained in remission (P < .01); treatment with calcipotriene foam for 8 weeks and calcipotriene plus betamethasone dipropionate gel for 4 to 12 weeks compared with placebo was safe and effective for mild to moderate scalp psoriasis.

### Renal association commentary on the KDIGO (2017) clinical practice guideline update for the diagnosis, evaluation, prevention, and treatment of CKD-MBD [^111nE5ax]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Rationale

Recommendation 4.2.4 was re-evaluated largely based on publications of post hoc analyses of the EVOLVE trial which investigated the effect of cinacalcet on cardiovascular disease in patients undergoing dialysis. Although EVOLVE did not meet its primary endpoint, the KDIGO Work Group acknowledges that subsequent pre-specified analyses suggest potential benefits of calcimimetics for stage 5D patients. Nevertheless, KDIGO explicitly endorses the presence of clinical equipoise in its narrative and the need for further research.

It should be noted that while calcimimetic therapy now appears first in the list of all acceptable treatment options, the KDIGO Work Group emphasises that calcimimetics, calcitriol, or vitamin D analogues are all acceptable first-line options, and there are no data to support clinical superiority of any one agent. In addition, the updated recommendation has removed specific statements for dosage adjustment of phosphate binder, calcitriol or other vitamin D analogues to manage levels of phosphate, PTH and calcium. The recommendation is that individual treatment choice should continue to be guided by considerations of concomitant therapies as well as calcium and phosphate levels. As such, the principal underlying this recommendation remains appropriate for UK practice.

The group also notes that the 2013 UK NICE guidance, as well as the previous technology appraisal guidance from 2007 (reviewed in 2013), both of which provide more specific guidance in recommending the use of calcimimetics in the treatment of refractory SHPT in patients with end-stage renal disease. With respect to the latter, this group agreed that there are many instances when the risks of surgery are considered to outweigh the benefits, which are not simply limited to peri-operative risk and may include number of other patient related biopsychosocial factors. Whilst parathyroidectomy remains an important and very effective treatment option in the management of SHPT, as with other sections within this commentary, we believe that decisions around medical and surgical options for the treatment of SHPT should be individualised and holistic. As such, we endorse the KDIGO recommendation 4.2.5 from 2009, unchanged in 2017 suggesting parathyroidectomy for patients with CKD G3a–G5D with severe hyperparathyroidism who fail to respond to medical or pharmacological therapy.

### Long-term treatment of hypoparathyroidism: a randomized controlled study comparing parathyroid hormone-(1–34) versus calcitriol and calcium [^116qQ4gY]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2003). Low credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism is one of the few remaining hormonal insufficiency states for which replacement therapy is unavailable. Previous short-term controlled trials have shown PTH to be a safe and effective treatment of hypoparathyroidism. In this randomized, parallel group, open-label trial, we compared synthetic human PTH-(1–34) (PTH) with conventional therapy, calcitriol and calcium, over a 3-yr period. Twenty-seven patients with confirmed hypoparathyroidism, aged 18–70 yr, were randomized to either twice daily sc PTH or oral calcitriol and calcium. The primary end points were calcium levels in serum and urine. Secondary end points were creatinine clearance, markers of bone turnover, and bone mineral density. Throughout the 3-yr study period, serum calcium levels were similar in both treatment groups within or just below the normal range. Mean urinary calcium excretion was within the normal range from 1–3 yr in PTH-treated patients, but remained above normal in the calcitriol group. Bone mineral content and bone mineral density showed no significant between-group differences over the 3-yr study period. We conclude that treatment with twice daily sc PTH provides a safe and effective alternative to calcitriol therapy and is able to maintain normal serum calcium levels without hypercalciuria for at least 3 yr in patients with hypoparathyroidism.

Vitamin D analogue topical therapy — long-term use of topical vitamin D analogues is recommended for mild to moderate psoriasis, with specified course lengths and combination strategies. The long-term use of topical vitamin D analogues (up to 52 weeks) is recommended for treatment of mild to moderate psoriasis. For scalp disease, calcipotriene foam and calcipotriene plus betamethasone dipropionate gel are recommended for 4–12 weeks. For facial psoriasis, topical calcitriol ointment or calcipotriene combined with hydrocortisone for 8 weeks can be used. Combination treatments with vitamin D analogues and potent class II and class III topical corticosteroids up to 52 weeks are recommended, and combination products with calcipotriene and corticosteroids are recommended. For maintenance, vitamin D analogues twice daily on weekdays with high-potency topical corticosteroids twice daily on weekends can be considered, and a regimen of morning high-potency topical corticosteroids with evening topical vitamin D analogues can be considered.

### Optimal vitamin D, calcitriol, and vitamin D analog replacement in chronic kidney disease: to D or not to D: that is the question [^115YuGpn]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are often insufficient in 25(OH) vitamin D and are almost uniformly deficient in 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D, because of decreased renal hydroxylation resulting from hyperphosphatemia and elevated fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF-23) levels. These same abnormalities lead to secondary hyperparathyroidism for which the administration of calcitriol or vitamin D analogs has been the mainstay of therapy for decades. This review summarizes new trials of vitamin D, calcitriol, and its analogs over the last 2 years.

Recent Findings

In addition to the endocrine effects of the vitamin D axis on bone and mineral metabolism, studies have demonstrated there is also extrarenal conversion of 25(OH) vitamin D to 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D in multiple cells leading to autocrine effects. This advance has led to the speculation that CKD patients may also need to be supplemented with ergocalciferol or cholecalciferol. Unfortunately, to date, the majority of interventional studies have focused on biochemical end points. There are no randomized controlled trials demonstrating that therapy with any formulation of vitamin D results in improved patient level outcomes.

Summary

Despite the physiologic importance of vitamin D in health and disease, more research is required to determine which vitamin D derivative is required for optimal health in CKD patients.

### Vitamin D and vitamin D analogues for preventing fractures associated with involutional and post-menopausal osteoporosis [^115SC2ED]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Vitamin D and related compounds have been used to prevent osteoporotic fractures in older people.

Objectives

To determine the effects of vitamin D or related compounds, with or without calcium, for preventing fractures in older people.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library 2007, Issue 3), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and reference lists of articles. Most recent search: October 2007.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised trials comparing vitamin D or related compounds, alone or with calcium, against placebo, no intervention, or calcium alone, reporting fracture outcomes in older people.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality, and extracted data. Data were pooled, where admissible, using the fixed-effect model, or random-effects model if heterogeneity between studies appeared high.

Main Results

Forty-five trials were included. Vitamin D alone appears unlikely to be effective in preventing hip fracture (nine trials, 24,749 participants, RR 1.15, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.33), vertebral fracture (five trials, 9138 participants, RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.92) or any new fracture (10 trials, 25,016 participants, RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.09). Vitamin D with calcium reduces hip fractures (eight trials, 46,658 participants, RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.96). Although subgroup analysis by residential status showed a significant reduction in hip fractures in people in institutional care, the difference between this and the community-dwelling subgroup was not significant (P = 0.15). Overall hypercalcaemia is significantly more common in people receiving vitamin D or an analogue, with or without calcium (18 trials, 11,346 participants, RR 2.35, 95% CI 1.59 to 3.47); this is especially true of calcitriol (four trials, 988 participants, RR 4.41, 95% CI 2.14 to 9.09). There is a modest increase in gastrointestinal symptoms (11 trials, 47,042 participants, RR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.08, P = 0.04) and a small but significant increase in renal disease (11 trials, 46,537 participants, RR 1.16, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.33).

Authors' Conclusions

Frail older people confined to institutions may sustain fewer hip fractures if given vitamin D with calcium. Vitamin D alone is unlikely to prevent fracture. Overall there is a small but significant increase in gastrointestinal symptoms and renal disease associated with vitamin D or its analogues. Calcitriol is associated with an increased incidence of hypercalcaemia.

### Impact of vitamin D3 dietary supplement matrix on clinical response [^113Rof7W]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Context

As a result of research suggesting increased health risk with low serum 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25(OH)D), health care providers are measuring it frequently. Providers and patients are faced with treatment choices when low status is identified.

Objective

To compare the safety and efficacy of three vitamin D3 dietary supplements with different delivery matrices.

Setting and Design

A 12-week, parallel group, single-masked, clinical trial was conducted in Seattle, Washington and Kailua Kona, Hawaii. Sixty-six healthy adults with (25(OH)D) < 33 ng/mL were randomly assigned to take one of three D3 supplements, ie, a chewable tablet (TAB), an oil-emulsified drop (DROP), or an encapsulated powder (CAP) at a label-claimed dose of 10,000 IU/day. Actual D3 content was assessed by a third party and the results adjusted based on the actual D3 content administered. Mean change in 25(OH)D/mcg D3 administered; difference in the proportion of D3 insufficient participants (ie, 25(OH)D ≤ 30 ng/mL) reaching sufficiency (ie, 25(OH)D ≥ 30 ng/mL); and mean change in serum 1, 25-dihydroxycholecalciferol were measured.

Results

In two of the three products tested, the measured vitamin D3 content varied considerably from the label-claimed dose. Differences in 25(OH)D/mcg D3 administered were significantly different between groups (P = 0.04; n = 55). Pairwise comparisons demonstrated DROP resulted in a greater increase than TAB (P < .05) but not than CAP. TAB was not different from CAP. The proportions reaching sufficiency were: 100% (TAB and CAP) and 80% (DROP) (P = 0.03 between groups; n = 55). 1, 25-Dihydroxycholecalciferol did not change significantly in any group.

Conclusions

Oil-emulsified vitamin D3 supplements resulted in a greater mean change in serum 25(OH)D concentration, but fewer patients reaching vitamin D sufficiency, than chewable or encapsulated supplements.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^1145ZUz5]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Treatment dosing for deficiency or insufficiency: We recommend treating infants and children who are vitamin D insufficient or deficient with 1000 IU/day for infants < 1 month old, 1000 to 5000 IU/day for children 1 to 12 months old, and > 5000 IU/day for children ≥ 12 months old; vitamin D levels should subsequently be maintained with 400 IU of vitamin D supplementation per day. For patients who demonstrate poor compliance, a high dose of vitamin D may be given as a single dose or repeated intermittently. It is important to recognize that simultaneous calcium supplementation is necessary, symptomatic hypocalcemia requires parenteral calcium replacement, and calcitriol and dihydrotachysterol can help treat hypocalcemia associated with rickets but do not build up vitamin D stores.

Objectives

To determine the effects of vitamin D or analogues, with or without calcium, in the prevention of fractures in older people.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Bone, Joint and Muscle Trauma Group trials register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and reference lists of articles. Most recent search: March 2005.

Selection Criteria

Randomised or quasi-randomised trials comparing vitamin D or an analogue, alone or with calcium, against placebo, no intervention, or calcium, reporting fracture outcomes, in older people.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality, and extracted data. Data were pooled, where admissible, using the fixed-effect model, or random-effects model if the relative risks were heterogeneous.

Main Results

Vitamin D alone showed no statistically significant effect on hip fracture (seven trials, 18,668 participants, RR 1.17, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.41), vertebral fracture (four trials, 5698 participants, RR (random effects) 1.13, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.55) or any new fracture (eight trials, 18,903 participants, RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.09). Vitamin D with calcium marginally reduced hip fractures (seven trials, 10,376 participants, RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.96), non-vertebral fractures (seven trials, 10,376 participants, RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.78 to 0.97), but there was no evidence of effect of vitamin D with calcium on vertebral fractures. The effect appeared to be restricted to those living in institutional care. Hypercalcaemia was more common when vitamin D or its analogues was given compared with placebo or calcium (14 trials, 8035 participants, RR 2.38, 95% CI 1.52 to 3.71). The risk was particularly high with calcitriol (three trials, 742 participants, RR 14.94, 95% CI 2.95 to 75.61). There was no evidence that vitamin D increased gastro-intestinal symptoms (seven trials, 10,188 participants, RR (random effects) 1.03, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.36) or renal disease (nine trials, 10,107 participants, RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.34 to 1.87).

Authors' Conclusions

Frail older people confined to institutions may sustain fewer hip and other non-vertebral fractures if given vitamin D with calcium supplements. Effectiveness of vitamin D alone in fracture prevention is unclear. There is no evidence of advantage of analogues of vitamin D compared with vitamin D. Calcitriol may be associated with an increased incidence of adverse effects. Dose, frequency, and route of administration of vitamin D in older people require further investigation.

Graves' disease postoperative calcium management — strategies and risk assessment (Recommendation 29) states that following thyroidectomy for GD, alternative strategies may be undertaken for management of calcium levels, with a weak recommendation, low-quality evidence: serum calcium with or without intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels can be measured and supplementation given based on results, or prophylactic calcium with or without calcitriol prescribed empirically. Low iPTH levels (< 10–15 pg/mL) in the immediate postoperative setting appear to predict symptomatic hypocalcemia and need for supplementation. Patients can be discharged if asymptomatic and their serum calcium levels corrected for albumin are 8.0 mg/ dL (2.0 mmol/L) or above and are not falling over a 24-hour period. Persistent hypocalcemia may warrant measurement of serum magnesium and possible repletion; following discharge, serum iPTH should be measured in persistent hypocalcemia to determine if permanent hypoparathyroidism is present or whether "bone hunger" is ongoing. In patients with severe hypocalcemia, teriparatide has yielded encouraging preliminary results, but more data are needed before it can be considered for clinical practice; intravenous calcium gluconate should be readily available and may be administered if symptoms worsen despite oral therapy.

### Vitamin D deficiency in children and its management: review of current knowledge and recommendations [^113dopje]. Pediatrics (2008). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D deficiency–associated hypocalcemia — calcium and calcitriol dosing guidance includes that hypocalcemia should be treated with calcium supplements, with parenteral calcium as calcium gluconate (10–20 mg of elemental calcium per kg intravenously slowly over 5–10 minutes, usually given as 1–2 mL/kg of 10% calcium gluconate) in cases of manifest tetany or convulsions. Recommended doses of elemental calcium are 30 to 75 mg/kg per day in 3 divided doses, and calcitriol may be necessary in doses of 20 to 100 ng/kg per day in 2 to 3 divided doses until calcium levels normalize. High doses of calcium are necessary early in the course of therapy, after which doses are reduced by half for the next 1 to 2 weeks. Once vitamin D is reduced to 400 IU/day with normal PTH and 25(OH)-D levels, calcium supplementation is usually not necessary.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^111NsF98]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Issues surrounding ergocalciferol use are of note for the United States, where 50 000 IU of vitamin D 2 was the only high-dose preparation available by physician prescription and, therefore, ergocalciferol was widely prescribed. Now, instead, 50 000 IU of vitamin D 3 is available by prescription. In addition to assay issues, widespread use of intermittent high-dose ergocalciferol ("bolus" therapy) appears to alter vitamin D metabolism, with increased 24-hydroxylase activity. Other adverse consequences of high-dose vitamin D therapy, notably increased fall risk, are reported and have led to calls to critically assess daily vs bolus vitamin D therapy.

To summarize, vitamins D 2 and D 3 are not equivalent in raising circulating 25(OH)D, and bolus dosing may have adverse effects on vitamin D metabolism and clinical outcomes. As such, it is to be expected that calls for the use of only cholecalciferol and avoidance of ergocalciferol have been and continue to be published with recent osteoporosis-treatment guidance advising cholecalciferol over ergocalciferol (see Table 4). Despite these recommendations, high-dose ergocalciferol remains widely prescribed in the United States.

Calcifediol

Calcifediol is the intermediate metabolite between cholecalciferol and calcitriol. Several pharmacokinetic studies performed in the last 4 decades have demonstrated its hydrophilic properties, leading to higher solubility in organic solvents, less sequestration in adipose tissue, smaller distribution volume, and shorter half-life when compared to cholecalciferol. By virtue of its hydrophilic properties, calcifediol is readily absorbed via the venous portal system and thus quickly increases circulating concentrations of 25(OH)D 3. In contrast to cholecalciferol, which is mostly stored in fat tissue, 25(OH)D tends to be more evenly distributed throughout the body (20% in muscle, 30% in circulation, 35% in fat, and 15% elsewhere). The administered dose will generally lead to predictable 25(OH)D levels and effective PTH suppression. In cases of toxicity, this form of vitamin D is easier to manage than cholecalciferol. Moreover, the greater affinity of calcifediol for DBP allows for more efficient internalization in cells expressing the megalin-cubilin system of endocytic receptors, such as the parathyroids and the renal tissue.

### Does treatment with calcitriol improve survival in predialysis patients with chronic kidney disease? [^117ACStB]. Nature Clinical Practice: Endocrinology & Metabolism (2008). Medium credibility.

Treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism with activated vitamin D analogs has been associated with improved survival of dialysis-dependent patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Whether this treatment regimen affords similar benefits to non-dialysis-dependent patients with CKD remains unclear. In this Practice Point commentary, we discuss a study by Kovesdy et al. that reported enhanced survival in predialysis patients with CKD who received calcitriol for a median duration of 2.1 years. Despite the achievement of favorable results in these patients, the study had several limitations that could preclude generalization of the findings to other populations. These limitations included the nonrandomized, observational design, the small patient population, the exclusive enrollment of men (76.5% of whom were white), and the lack of information on cause of death. Here, we place the findings of the study into clinical context and emphasize the urgent need for large, well-designed, randomized trials that aim to assess cardiovascular and mortality end points.

### Label: CALCITRIOL capsule… [^1128iCx9]. FDA (DailyMed) (2017). Low credibility.

The kidneys of uremic patients cannot adequately synthesize calcitriol, the active hormone formed from precursor vitamin D. Resultant hypocalcemia and secondary hyperparathyroidism are a major cause of the metabolic bone disease of renal failure. However, other bone-toxic substances which accumulate in uremia may also contribute. In vivo and in vitro studies indicate the presence of two pathways of metabolism for calcitriol. The first pathway involves the 24-hydroxylase as the first step in catabolism of calcitriol. There is definite evidence of 24-hydroxylase activity in the kidney; this enzyme is also present in many target tissues which possess the vitamin D receptor such as the intestine. The end product of this pathway is a side chain shortened metabolite, calcitroic acid. The second pathway involves the conversion of calcitriol via the stepwise hydroxylation of carbon-26 and carbon-23, and cyclization to yield ultimately 1α, 25R2-26, 23S-lactone D3.

Lower predose and peak calcitriol levels in serum were observed in patients with nephrotic syndrome and in patients undergoing hemodialysis compared with healthy subjects. The elimination half-life of calcitriol increased by at least twofold in chronic renal failure and hemodialysis patients compared with healthy subjects. Peak serum levels in patients with nephrotic syndrome were reached in 4 hours. For patients requiring hemodialysis peak serum levels were reached in 8 to 12 hours; half-lives were estimated to be 16. 2 and
21. 9 hours, respectively. Calcitriol increases inorganic phosphate levels in serum. While this is desirable in patients with hypophosphatemia, caution is called for in patients with renal failure because of the danger of ectopic calcification. A nonaluminum phosphate-binding compound and a low-phosphate diet should be used to control serum phosphorus levels in patients undergoing dialysis.

Due to the relatively short duration of the pharmacological action of calcitriol, further measures are probably unnecessary. Should, however, persistent and markedly elevated serum calcium levels occur, there are a variety of therapeutic alternatives which may be considered, depending on the patient's underlying condition. These include the use of drugs such as phosphates and corticosteroids as well as measures to induce an appropriate forced diuresis. The use of peritoneal dialysis against a calcium-free dialysate has also been reported.

### Intravenous versus oral vitamin D therapy in dialysis patients: what is the question? [^114fRTyM]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

The debate regarding the administration of vitamin D (parenteral versus pulse oral) in dialysis patients has centered on the efficacy of parathyroid hormone (PTH) suppression while ignoring other questions related to complications and compliance. Past studies looking at efficacy showed no differences during short-term treatment, although the small number of patients studied reduces the significance of these findings. Long-term studies with larger populations have shown that parenteral calcitriol is more effective than pulse oral calcitriol in suppressing PTH. When considering the questions of complications and compliance the current literature demonstrates that parenteral vitamin D therapy is associated with fewer episodes of hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia and that patients receiving pulse oral calcitriol require more phosphate binders. Because of the documented high noncompliance rate with oral medications in the dialysis population, parenterally administered vitamin D is expected to more completely suppress PTH long term and result in fewer parathyroidectomies. Based on these considerations it is suggested that parenteral vitamin D analogs are superior to pulse oral calcitriol for the long-term control of hyperparathyroidism in dialysis patients.

### Calcitriol ointment: optimizing psoriasis therapy [^1164VLZc]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

The topical vitamin D3 modulator calcitriol, the naturally occurring active form of vitamin D3, has long been used for topical psoriasis therapy in Europe and other countries and was recently approved in the United States (U.S.) for the treatment of plaque psoriasis. In vehicle-controlled clinical trials, calcitriol 3 microg/g ointment has been shown to significantly improve the symptoms of psoriasis with a low incidence of adverse effects and without affecting calcium homeostasis, even when applied continuously for up to one year. A number of studies have examined the efficacy and safety of calcitriol ointment in combination therapy regimens that also included topical corticosteroid therapy or ultraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy. Calcitriol 3 microg/g ointment is a new option that provides flexibility for use in a variety of psoriasis treatment regimens. According to guidelines developed by the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD), the goals of psoriasis treatment are to produce durable remission of psoriasis symptoms, to achieve "substantial" clearing with the possibility of complete clearing, to maintain the initial benefits of therapy, and to minimize the risk of adverse events. Topical medications are the most commonly used treatments for psoriasis in the U.S. and are important in meeting the goals of psoriasis therapy. These agents offer high response rates with generally favorable safety and tolerability profiles and are useful for both acute treatment and long-term maintenance. Topical medications are used by approximately 85% of patients with psoriasis.

### Suppression of parathyroid hormone secretion in hemodialysis patients: comparison of paricalcitol with calcitriol [^111AbpW6]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Paricalcitol was introduced recently as an effective alternative to calcitriol for the suppression of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in patients with end-stage renal disease. An international, multicenter, double-blinded, randomized, comparative study of intravenous paricalcitol and calcitriol was performed. Results from 38 patients at dialysis units affiliated with the Northwestern University Medical School (Chicago and Evanston, IL) are reported here while a report of the full clinical trial is being completed. Results were evaluated in terms of obtaining the following end points: decrease of at least 50% in baseline PTH concentration and the occurrence of hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. Paricalcitol therapy was started at a dose of 0.04 microgram/kg and increased by 0.04 microgram/kg increments every 4 weeks to a maximum allowable dose of 0.24 microgram/kg or until there was at least a 50% decrease in serum PTH concentration. Calcitriol therapy was started at a dose of 0.01 microgram/kg and increased by 0.01 microgram/kg increments every 4 weeks to a maximum allowable dose of 0.06 microgram/kg or until there was at least a 50% decrease in serum PTH concentration. Mean baseline serum PTH, calcium, and phosphorus concentrations were similar. Reductions in PTH occurred more rapidly in subjects administered paricalcitol compared with calcitriol, with no difference in serum calcium levels throughout the study between groups. The percentage of subjects experiencing severe hyperphosphatemia (serum phosphorus > 8.0 mg/dL) was greater in those administered calcitriol compared with paricalcitol. In conclusion, our data suggest that paricalcitol reduces PTH levels more rapidly, with fewer episodes of hyperphosphatemia, than intravenous calcitriol.

### Calcitriol 3 microg / g ointment: an effective and safe addition to the armamentarium in topical psoriasis therapy [^115zVa8n]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

High-potency topical corticosteroids are very effective for the treatment of psoriasis, but are associated with a number of cutaneous adverse effects. Vitamin D modulators have emerged as an important alternative to corticosteroids for the long-term topical treatment of psoriasis. Calcitriol 3 microg/g ointment has long been used to treat psoriasis in Europe and is now the only vitamin D3 ointment available for use in the United States (U.S.). Several randomized clinical trials have compared the safety, efficacy, and cosmetic acceptability of calcitriol ointment with other topical psoriasis therapies. In a three-week investigator-blinded study of 25 healthy subjects, calcitriol 3microg/g ointment was associated with markedly less cumulative skin irritation than was calcipotriene ointment. A multicenter, investigator-blinded study of patients with psoriasis found that investigator-rated global improvement of psoriasis symptoms with calcitriol ointment was statistically noninferior to calcipotriene ointment and that calcitriol use produced significantly fewer patients with cutaneous reactions or discomfort. A multicenter clinical trial of patients with psoriasis who had lesions affecting sensitive skin areas found that calcitriol use produced less skin irritation than did calcipotriene and was generally preferred to calcipotriene ointment by patients. Calcitriol was also significantly more effective for the treatment of psoriasis lesions affecting flexural areas. In another study, patients who received calcitriol ointment exhibited improvement in psoriasis symptoms that was similar to the corticosteroid betamethasone propionate, but were much less likely to have relapsed eight weeks after treatment discontinuation. Two clinical studies also suggested that calcitriol is similar in efficacy to short-contact dithranol, but with a lower incidence of skin irritation and staining. Together, the results of these studies demonstrate that calcitriol 3 microg/g ointment is a significant new option for topical therapy of psoriasis. Calcitriol ointment produces improvement in psoriasis symptoms that is generally similar to the improvement attained with other (except for high potency steroid) topical psoriasis therapies, with a low incidence of adverse events.

### Clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of X-linked hypophosphataemia [^116rWEK7]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2019). High credibility.

Box 3 Recommendations for treatment in children

We recommend treating children with overt X-linked hypophosphataemia (XLH) phenotype with a combination of oral phosphorus (phosphate salts) and active vitamin D (calcitriol or alfacalcidol) as soon as diagnosis is established (grade B, moderate recommendation)
We recommend an initial dose of 20–60 mg/kg body weight daily (0.7–2.0 mmol/kg daily) of elemental phosphorus in infants and preschool children, which should be adjusted according to the improvement of rickets, growth, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (grade C, moderate recommendation)
We recommend phosphate supplements should be taken as frequently as possible, for example, 4–6 times daily in young patients with high ALP levels. The frequency can be lowered to 3–4 times daily when ALP has normalized (grade B, moderate recommendation)
We recommend a progressive increase in the dose of phosphate supplements in cases of insufficient clinical response but avoidance of doses > 80 mg/kg daily (based on elemental phosphorus) to prevent gastrointestinal discomfort and hyperparathyroidism. If these adverse effects are present, treatment should be adjusted by decreasing the dose and/or increasing the frequency (grade C, moderate recommendation)
We recommend the use of low doses in patients with mild phenotypes, for instance, infants diagnosed by family screening (grade C, moderate recommendation)
We recommend an initial dose of calcitriol of 20–30 ng/kg body weight daily or alfacalcidol of 30–50 ng/kg body weight daily. Alternatively, treatment can be started empirically at 0.5 μg daily of calcitriol or 1 μg of alfacalcidol in patients > 12 months old and adjusted on the basis of clinical and biochemical responses (grade C, moderate recommendation)
To prevent nephrocalcinosis, we recommend keeping calciuria levels within the normal range and avoiding large doses of phosphate supplements; we suggest measures that decrease urinary calcium concentration, excretion and/or crystallization if necessary, including regular water intake, administration of potassium citrate and limited sodium intake (grade C, moderate recommendation)
With respect to secondary hyperparathyroidism, we recommend the following: Patients on conventional treatment with elevated PTH levels should be managed by increasing the dose of active vitamin D and/or decreasing the dose of oral phosphate supplements (grade C, moderate recommendation) Treatment with calcimimetics might be considered in patients with persistent secondary hyperparathyroidism despite the above-mentioned measures (grade D, weak recommendation). Cinacalcet should be used with caution in XLH, as it has been associated with severe adverse effects, namely, hypocalcaemia and increased QT interval (grade X, strong recommendation) Parathyroidectomy should be considered in case of tertiary hyperparathyroidism (persistent hypercalcaemic hyperparathyroidism) despite optimized active vitamin D and cinacalcet therapy (grade C, moderate recommendation)

### Vitamin D in health and disease [^1155ipHT]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Vitamin D functions in the body through both an endocrine mechanism (regulation of calcium absorption) and an autocrine mechanism (facilitation of gene expression). The former acts through circulating calcitriol, whereas the latter, which accounts for more than 80% of the metabolic utilization of the vitamin each day, produces, uses, and degrades calcitriol exclusively intracellularly. In patients with end-stage kidney disease, the endocrine mechanism is effectively disabled; however, the autocrine mechanism is able to function normally so long as the patient has adequate serum levels of 25(OH)D, on which its function is absolutely dependent. For this reason, calcitriol and its analogs do not constitute adequate replacement in managing vitamin D needs of such patients. Optimal serum 25(OH)D levels are greater than 32 ng/mL (80 nmol/L). The consequences of low 25(OH)D status include increased risk of various chronic diseases, ranging from hypertension to diabetes to cancer. The safest and most economical way to ensure adequate vitamin D status is to use oral dosing of native vitamin D. (Both daily and intermittent regimens work well.) Serum 25(OH)D can be expected to rise by about 1 ng/mL (2.5 nmol/L) for every 100 IU of additional vitamin D each day. Recent data indicate that cholecalciferol (vitamin D(3)) is substantially more potent than ergocalciferol (vitamin D(2)) and that the safe upper intake level for vitamin D(3) is 10,000 IU/d.

KDIGO 2017 CKD-MBD — paricalcitol versus calcitriol randomized trials in nondialysis CKD showed similar PTH lowering with low hypercalcemia incidence. One RCT compared calcitriol (0.25 μg/d) with paricalcitol (1 μg/d) in 110 patients with CKD G3a to G3b and G4 and PTH ≥ 120 pg/ml (12.7 pmol/l); the change in PTH was comparable (a decline of 52% vs. 46%) over the 6-month trial, and hypercalcemia was very low (only 3 with paricalcitol and 1 with calcitriol). Across two RCTs, neither demonstrated differences in the incidence of hypercalcemia.

### Calcitriol-mediated hypercalcemia as an immune-related adverse event in a patient receiving nivolumab and ipilimumab for metastatic renal cell carcinoma, case report [^114grC7F]. BMC Urology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

In the setting of malignancy, multiple mechanisms have been found to cause hypercalcemia. The most common of these are local osteolysis due to bony invasion from solid and hematologic malignancies (e.g. breast cancer), humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy due to paraneoplastic hormones (e.g. PTHrP), ectopic hyperparathyroidism, and calcitriol-secreting tumors (e.g. lymphoma). Calcitriol-mediated hypercalcemia accounts for approximately 1% of cases of hypercalcemia in the setting of malignancy. Under normal physiologic circumstances, vitamin D is stored in the liver as 25-hydroxyvitamin D. When hypocalcemic, it is released due to the presence of PTH before ultimately undergoing conversion to calcitriol by renal 1-α-hydroxylase. Calcitriol then signals for both increased calcium absorption via the intestines, as well as increased osteolytic activity in the bone. The cumulative effect leads to improved serum calcium levels. Certain malignancies are able to produce extra-renal 1-alpha-hydroxylase, leading to increased production of calcitriol. This is true most commonly with lymphoid malignancies, especially in the setting of progressive disease, whereas with solid tumors this is a rare occurrence. In such rare cases involving solid tumors, alternative mechanisms for explaining calcitriol-mediated hypercalcemia must be explored, particularly when therapies themselves may play a role, such as in the case described below.

Chapter 4.2: Treatment of abnormal PTH levels in CKD-MBD

Guideline 4.2.1

We suggest that CKD G3a-G5 patients with progressively rising or persistently elevated PTH levels should be evaluated for modifiable factors, which now includes high phosphate intake and vitamin D deficiency; treatment decisions should not be based on a single elevated value.

Guideline 4.2.2

The updated guideline no longer recommends routine use of calcitriol or its analogs in non-dialysis CKD patients. We suggest that clinicians should reserve their use for severe and progressive SHPT, starting at low dose and avoiding hypercalcaemia.

Guideline 4.2.4

We suggest that calcimimetics, calcitriol and vitamin D analogues are all acceptable therapies for CKD G5D patients requiring PTH lowering therapy. Individual treatment choice should continue to be guided by considerations of concomitant therapies as well as calcium and phosphate levels.

For those patients with severe hyperparathyroidism that fail to respond to medical or pharmacological therapy, we suggest parathyroidectomy.

Chapter 4.3: Treatment of bone with bisphosphonates, other osteoporosis medications, and growth hormone

Guideline 4.3

In patients with CKD G3a–G5D and evidence of MBD, we suggest that treatment choices take specific side effects into account and the risk of their administration must be weighed against the accuracy of the diagnosis of the underlying bone phenotype.

Chapter 5: Evaluation and treatment of kidney transplant bone disease

Guideline 5.5

As with CKD G3a-G5D, we suggest that DXA may be a useful tool to assess fracture risk in kidney transplant recipients (G5T). Unfortunately, even when in possession of that knowledge, there is a paucity of evidence regarding interventions that reduce future fractures in transplanted patients.

Guideline 5.6

This group suggests considering vitamin D, calcitriol/alfacalcidol, and/or antiresorptive agents in the first year post transplant in patients with a reduced BMD and eGFR > 30 ml/min/1.73m 2. However, as there remains no consensus on the optimal treatment strategy for mineral metabolism abnormalities, initiation of antiresorptive agents is likely to remain guided by local practice in this population.

Paediatric specific recommendations

We suggest a calcium-based phosphate binder as the first-line phosphate reduction therapy in children and either combining with, or switching to, sevelamer if a series of serum calcium measurements shows a trend towards the age-adjusted upper limit of normal.

### Safety and efficacy of PTH 1–34 and 1–84 therapy in chronic hypoparathyroidism: a meta-analysis of prospective trials [^114vaGkA]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Through a systematic analysis of all published clinical trials, we collated the largest group to date of patients treated with PTH‐receptor agonists and demonstrated their efficacy in restoring serum phosphate levels, reducing calcium excretion and reactivating bone turnover — all issues that are not addressed by any alternative treatment. These therapies also enabled the reduction or discontinuation of oral calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and had a relatively good safety profile.

The first clinical study on PTH replacement therapy in hypoparathyroidism dates back to 1996. Despite the 25 years elapsed since then, very few randomized trials have been conducted to date, and none have compared PTH 1−34 and PTH 1−84. Given the rarity of this disease, the few trials conducted were small in size and heterogeneous in outcomes or design, limiting the ability to draw robust conclusions. PTH replacement therapy is not currently used as standard clinical practice according to the European guidelines. However, although the conventional therapies are generally able to control hypocalcaemia, they leave several clinical issues unaddressed: hyperphosphatemia, hypercalciuria, and nephrocalcinosis are a significant burden for many patients, for whom PTH treatment might well be a better alternative.

One of the concerns in the treatment of hypoparathyroidism with calcium and calcitriol supplements is the delicate balance between overtreatment and symptomatic hypocalcaemia. Our meta‐analysis showed PTH replacement therapy could be considered neither superior nor inferior to oral supplements in controlling serum calcium levels. This may be because the patients enrolled in clinical trials were mostly on target for calcium at the baseline, and their oral calcium supplements were significantly reduced or discontinued during studies. It is worth noticing that studies were heterogenous in duration. We showed that PTH therapies are safe with respect to the risk of hypocalcemic or hypercalcemic episodes.

An unmet need in hypoparathyroidism is combating the associated rise in serum phosphate levels, which are largely unaffected by conventional therapies. Active vitamin D is unable to match the phosphaturic action of PTH and can even worsen hyperphosphatemia, by promoting intestinal phosphate absorption. Our meta‐analysis revealed a large posttreatment reduction in serum phosphate and a significant difference between patients receiving PTH therapies and controls. PTH 1−34 and PTH 1−84 showed a similar efficacy in lowering serum phosphate.

CKD stage 5D — pharmacologic management of increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels is guided as follows: In patients with CKD stage 5D and increased or increasing PTH levels, we suggest that calcitriol, vitamin D analogues, calcimimetics, or a combination of calcimimetics and calcitriol or vitamin D analogues be used to decrease PTH levels (2B). It is reasonable that the initial drug selection for the treatment of increased PTH level be based on serum calcium and phosphorus levels and other aspects of CKD-MBD (not graded), and it is reasonable that calcium- or non–calcium-based phosphate binder dosage be adjusted so that treatments to control PTH levels do not compromise phosphorus and calcium levels (not graded). We recommend that in patients with hypercalcemia, calcitriol or other vitamin D sterol be reduced or stopped (1B), and we suggest that in patients with hyperphosphatemia, calcitriol or other vitamin D sterol be reduced or stopped (2D). We suggest that in patients with hypocalcemia, calcimimetics be reduced or stopped depending on severity, concomitant medications, and clinical signs and symptoms (2D), and we suggest that if iPTH levels decrease to less than 2 times the upper reference limit for the assay, calcitriol, vitamin D analogues, and/or calcimimetics be reduced or stopped (2C). There are no data supporting the clinical superiority of any vitamin D analogues available in the United States compared with calcitriol or placebo.

### Renal association commentary on the KDIGO (2017) clinical practice guideline update for the diagnosis, evaluation, prevention, and treatment of CKD-MBD [^112jeeMW]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Rationale

In the interval since the 2009 KDIGO Guideline, one eligible RCT examined the impact of cholecalciferol supplementation and 3 examined the impact of phosphate binders on PTH levels in the non-dialysis CKD population. The former showed a significant reduction in PTH values with vitamin D supplementation, with no difference between the high- or low-dose groups (reinforcing the original statement from 2009 regarding correction of vitamin D deficiency; recommendation 3.1.3). Of the 3 studies investigating the effect of phosphate control on PTH levels, one reported stable PTH levels in the active therapy (phosphate binder) group with a 21% increase in PTH in the placebo group. As a result, "high phosphate intake", was added to the list of modifiable risk factors in the updated recommendation due to the increasing recognition that excess phosphate intake does not always result in hyperphosphatemia, especially in early CKD, but may promote SHPT.

Despite these additional data, there is still an absence of RCTs that define an optimal PTH level for patients with CKD G3a to G5, or clinical endpoints of hospitalisation, fracture, or mortality. Modest increases in PTH may actually represent an appropriate adaptive response to declining kidney function, due to its phosphaturic effects and increasing bone resistance to PTH, hence the optimal PTH level remains unknown.

RA recommendation

We suggest that CKD G3a-G5 patients with progressively rising or persistently elevated PTH levels should be evaluated for modifiable factors, which now includes high phosphate intake and vitamin D deficiency; treatment decisions should not be based on a single elevated value.

2009 KDIGO guideline

4.2.2: In adult patients with CKD G3a–G5 not on dialysis, we suggest that calcitriol and vitamin D analogs not be routinely used (2C). It is reasonable to reserve the use of calcitriol and vitamin D analogs for patients with CKD G4–G5 with severe and progressive hyperparathyroidism (Not Graded).

It is reasonable to reserve the use of calcitriol and vitamin D analogs for patients with CKD G4–G5 with severe and progressive hyperparathyroidism (Not Graded).

### Paricalcitol [^1165AX1e]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Excessive administration of vitamin D compounds, including paricalcitol capsules, can cause over suppression of PTH, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hyperphosphatemia, and adynamic bone disease.

5.1 Hypercalcemia

Progressive hypercalcemia due to overdosage of vitamin D and its metabolites may be so severe as to require emergency attention [see Overdosage (10)]. Acute hypercalcemia may exacerbate tendencies for cardiac arrhythmias and seizures and may potentiate the action of digitalis. Chronic hypercalcemia can lead to generalized vascular calcification and other soft-tissue calcification. Concomitant administration of high doses of calcium-containing preparations or thiazide diuretics with paricalcitol may increase the risk of hypercalcemia. High intake of calcium and phosphate concomitant with vitamin D compounds may lead to serum abnormalities requiring more frequent patient monitoring and individualized dose titration. Patients also should be informed about the symptoms of elevated calcium, which include feeling tired, difficulty thinking clearly, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, constipation, increased thirst, increased urination and weight loss.

Prescription-based doses of vitamin D and its derivatives should be withheld during paricalcitol treatment to avoid hypercalcemia.

5.2 Digitalis Toxicity

Digitalis toxicity is potentiated by hypercalcemia of any cause. Use caution when paricalcitol capsules are prescribed concomitantly with digitalis compounds.

5.3 Laboratory Tests

During the initial dosing or following any dose adjustment of medication, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, and serum or plasma iPTH should be monitored at least every two weeks for 3 months, then monthly for 3 months, and every 3 months thereafter.

In pre-dialysis patients, paricalcitol capsules may increase serum creatinine and therefore decrease the estimated GFR (eGFR). Similar effects have also been seen with calcitriol.

5.4 Aluminum Overload and Toxicity

Aluminum-containing preparations (e.g., antacids, phosphate binders) should not be administered chronically with paricalcitol, as increased blood levels of aluminum and aluminum bone toxicity may occur.

American Thyroid Association — Table 4 key recommendations for prevention and management of hypoparathyroidism: Conduct surgery so as to avoid removal or devascularization of parathyroid tissue. Autotransplant devascularized or inadvertently removed parathyroid glands. Either treat at-risk patients empirically with calcium, or measure calcium and/or PTH in the immediate postoperative period and treat according to evidence-based protocols. Titrate calcium with or without calcitriol to maintain eucalcemia, and wean calcium and/or calcitriol when appropriate. Communication between providers is critical, since hypoPT may be prolonged and can negatively affect multiple organ systems. Inability to achieve independence from calcium by six months indicates permanent hypoPT. Recombinant human PTH analogues may be considered for patients with permanent hypoPT. Avoiding hypoPT is much less costly than treating hypoPT. Teriparatide acetate (recombinant human PTH 1–34; rhPTH[1–34]) is an approved treatment for osteoporosis, but it is currently being studied as a possible off-label treatment for postoperative hypoPT.

### Doxercalciferol treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism [^116fx7ve]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, effectiveness, safety, and therapeutic considerations related to the use of doxercalciferol in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1966-June 2006) was conducted using the key words vitamin D, ergocalciferols, and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Text word searches were also performed for the terms 1-alpha-hydroxy-vitamin D(2), 1-alpha-hydroxyergocalciferol, Hectorol, and doxercalciferol. Searches were limited to studies published in English and conducted in human subjects.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All published clinical studies evaluating the safety and effectiveness of doxercalciferol in secondary hyperparathyroidism were reviewed, and anecdotal patient reports were also evaluated. Selected clinical studies involving the use of calcitriol and/or paricalcitol in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism were also included.

Data Synthesis

Doxercalciferol effectively reduces parathyroid hormone levels in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Both oral and intravenous administration can significantly increase serum calcium and/or phosphorus levels as evidenced by placebo-controlled clinical trials. This agent has not been studied comparatively with calcitriol or paricalcitol to assess relative safety.

Conclusions

Doxercalciferol is approved for and effective in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism related to CKD, both before and during dialysis, but has not demonstrated a lower incidence of hypercalcemia and/or hyperphosphatemia in relation to other vitamin D therapies. The drug is available in both oral and intravenous dosage forms. Doxercalciferol should be maintained as a formulary alternative for patients unresponsive to or intolerant of other vitamin D therapies, but comparative randomized studies are needed to differentiate its place in therapy.

### Vitamin D: the iceberg nutrient [^114zxSHh]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

The understanding of vitamin D's role in human health has recently expanded. It is now recognized as more than a hormone activated in the kidney only for calcium homeostasis. It is metabolized and used by virtually every cell in the body. Patients with chronic kidney disease have a deficit in their kidney production of 1,25(OH)(2)D and have classically been treated with calcitriol or its active analogues. Despite often having lower systemic levels of 1,25(OH)(2)D, patients with chronic kidney disease retain the capability of extra renal production of 1,25(OH)(2)D. This has far reaching implications for their health. This review examines clinical trials and observations in 3 areas that impact chronic kidney disease patients. Cancer, cardiovascular disease and infections are responsible for much of the morbidity and mortality in this patient population. We will discuss vitamin D's role in these disease states with a focus on the chronic kidney disease patient.

### A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled first-in-human phase 1 trial of transCon PTH in healthy adults [^112F5wSw]. Journal of Bone and Mineral Research (2020). Medium credibility.

The TransCon PTH PK and PD results mirror those of Winer and colleagues, showing an infusion‐like profile at steady state with control of sCa, sP, and uCa and the absence of an anabolic effect on bone. Thus, once‐daily TransCon PTH may effectively treat patients with HP. Its prolonged half‐life of approximately 60 hours produced stable coverage of Free PTH within the lower half of the calculated normal range over 24 hours, which may provide greater stability of sCa and improve safety. The short half‐lives of both calcitriol and currently available PTH‐based therapies lead to daily sCa fluctuations, and stopping or missing a dose can lead to acute symptomatic and debilitating hypocalcemia. In contrast, due to its longer half‐life, daily TransCon PTH may lead to more stable sCa levels as well as a lower risk of severe hypocalcemia if a dose is missed. In the long‐term, improved control of sCa, sP, and uCa may also be associated with improved outcomes, allowing patients with HP to avoid the long‐term complications of chronic active vitamin D and calcium supplementation, including renal insufficiency, nephrolithiasis, and ectopic calcifications. Finally, normocalcemia obtained by an infusion‐like profile of PTH may allow complete discontinuation of active vitamin D and calcium, thus reducing overall pill burden and further contributing to improved quality of life for patients with HP.

### Call to action: a five nations consensus on the use of intravenous zoledronate after hip fracture [^116guG5A]. Age and Ageing (2023). Medium credibility.

Vitamin D status and vitamin D loading regimes

The primary aim of vitamin D loading is to reduce the risk of symptomatic hypocalcaemia. Short-term supplementation using typical daily doses of 400–800 IU is insufficient to achieve this. NICE guidance recommends 300,000 IU of vitamin D, split into divided doses over a 6–8-week period. However, this timescale is impractical in the acute hip fracture setting, where the primary aim should be to administer the IV Zol as efficiently as is safe in a time of highly imminent re-fracture risk, i.e. prior to discharge from hospital to avoid the need to return whilst mobility is recovering.

Biochemical vitamin D deficiency is common in the hip fracture population. Checking vitamin D levels before loading can cause delay, generate inaccurate results in the acute phase and add to costs and workload. High-dose loading provides an alternative approach, with toxicity in the form of severe hypercalcaemia very rare.

Whilst large vitamin D doses given to community-dwelling, vitamin-D-replete women may paradoxically increase fracture risk (RR 1.25 for all fractures with 500,000-IU oral vitamin D3; RR 1.49 for hip fracture with 300,000-IU intramuscular vitamin D2), any risk associated with higher dosing in a community setting must be balanced against the huge potential benefit of administering IV Zol safely prior to discharge, in a hip fracture population with a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. In support, a single-dose 250,000 IU oral vitamin D has been shown to be safe and effective after hip fracture. Hence, a loading regime of 150,000–250,000 IU, given in 'split' doses over 1–7 days, is appropriate. The risk of missing a single large dose (for instance, if a patient is 'nil by mouth', delirious or vomiting or if lost tablets or spillages mean the drug is erroneously recorded as having been taken) can be minimised by 'splitting' loading doses. The prescribed vitamin D must be taken before IV Zol is administered.

### Renal association commentary on the KDIGO (2017) clinical practice guideline update for the diagnosis, evaluation, prevention, and treatment of CKD-MBD [^1138uVak]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Rationale

Since the KDIGO CKD-MBD Guidelines were developed in 2009 two RCTs have demonstrated increased hypercalcemia without any clinically relevant benefit in PTH lowering compared to earlier studies included in the 2009 KDIGO Guidelines. Two randomised trials, PRIMO and OPERA, that examined the effect of a vitamin D analogue (Paricalcitol) vs. placebo in CKD patients with left ventricular hypertrophy, did not show a difference in left ventricular mass index or diastolic dysfunction between groups after almost 12-months of follow-up. The PRIMO study used higher doses of Paricalcitol at 2 μg/day while the OPERA study used 1 μg daily, and PTH levels were significantly lower in the Paricalcitol treated groups in both studies. Both studies showed that episodes of hypercalcaemia were more frequent in the Paricalcitol group compared with the placebo group. Thus, lowering serum PTH failed to demonstrate improvements in clinically relevant outcomes but showed increased risk of hypercalcemia. Accordingly, routine use of calcitriol or its analogs in CKD Stages 3a–5 is no longer recommended.

Previous UK recommendations were in concordance with the original KDIGO guideline from 2009 and suggest that treatment is considered if PTH levels are persistently above the upper reference limit for the assay in patients with CKD 3b–5 and above 9 times the upper limit of normal for patients on dialysis, suggesting that treatment is modified in order to keep PTH levels between 2 and 9 times the upper limit of normal in dialysis patients. NICE guidelines on Cinacalcet use have not been modified since the publication of the EVOLVE trial.

RA recommendation

The updated guideline no longer recommends routine use of calcitriol or its analogs in non-dialysis CKD patients. We suggest that clinicians should reserve their use for severe and progressive SHPT, starting at low dose and avoiding hypercalcaemia.
