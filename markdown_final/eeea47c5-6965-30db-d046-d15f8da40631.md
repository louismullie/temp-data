## Question

Calcium gluconate

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about calcium gluconate. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pharmacology and mechanism of action. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled indication and limitations. Next, I will examine key off-label uses with dosing and evidence quality, including hyperkalemia, calcium channel blocker toxicity, and hydrofluoric acid burns. After that, I need to check pediatric-specific dosing and safety. I will then review administration, dilution, and monitoring requirements, including extravasation risk. Finally, I should confirm contraindications, drug interactions, special populations, and a concise clinical decision framework, making sure I double-check any numerical claims against the labels and guidelines as I go.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacology and mechanism. Calcium gluconate dissociates in plasma to ionized calcium, which is the biologically active fraction; distribution follows standard calcium physiology with most calcium in bone and about half of serum calcium ionized, and elimination is largely renal, with IV administration producing a predictable increase in ionized calcium and urinary calcium excretion, which underpins both therapeutic and toxicity considerations [^39bf55e0].

> I need to verify the labeled indication and scope. The FDA labeling indicates calcium gluconate injection for the treatment of acute symptomatic hypocalcemia in adults and pediatrics, with an explicit limitation that long-term safety of IV use has not been established, so chronic parenteral therapy should be avoided outside of specialized contexts with close monitoring [^27dcf7be] [^c49b9eb0].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about off-label uses; I should confirm the strength of evidence. For hyperkalemia with ECG changes, multiple high-credibility guidelines recommend IV calcium as first-line membrane stabilization, with UKKA advising calcium chloride in arrest or peri-arrest and calcium gluconate otherwise, and AHA guidance endorsing calcium for severe CCB toxicity; these are supported by animal data and observational human evidence, though randomized trials are sparse, so I should frame these as guideline-supported rather than RCT-proven [^760303f2] [^a72ba9fd] [^56516c57] [^787f8f06].

> Wait, let me verify the hyperkalemia dosing specifics so I don't misstate them. UKKA recommends 30 mL of 10% calcium gluconate over 10 minutes, which delivers about 2.8 g of calcium gluconate and roughly 260 mg elemental calcium, and this is the dose I should cite precisely; I initially thought "about 3 g", but I should correct that to 2.8 g to be exact per the guideline [^a72ba9fd].

> Next, I should review calcium channel blocker and beta-blocker toxicity. The ACC/AHA/HRS guidance supports IV calcium as a first-line therapy when reliable venous access is present, with typical regimens of 10% calcium gluconate 3–6 g IV every 10–20 minutes or infusion at 0.6–1.2 mL/kg/h, often titrated to hemodynamic response and ionized calcium targets up to about 1.5–2 times normal in refractory cases; again, evidence is largely from case series and animal models, so expectations should be tempered and combined with other modalities as needed [^ccaa09f6] [^b67b8cc7] [^56516c57].

> I will now examine hydrofluoric acid burns, where calcium gluconate is foundational. Prehospital and specialty guidance endorse topical calcium gluconate gel for dermal exposure and IV calcium gluconate for systemic toxicity or large exposures, with case-based evidence supporting soaking when gel is unavailable; I should emphasize that IV therapy is reserved for significant systemic involvement or refractory pain despite topical therapy [^a9edf1ff] [^aefd9b73] [^948b37bd].

> Let me consider pediatric dosing carefully and double-check the math. For symptomatic hypocalcemia, 10–20 mg/kg elemental calcium IV slowly over 5–10 minutes is recommended, which corresponds to roughly 1–2 mL/kg of 10% calcium gluconate; for hyperkalemia, 50 mg/kg of 10% calcium gluconate IV over 5 minutes is a commonly cited pediatric dose, with a maximum of 2 g in many protocols; I should confirm that these align with pediatric endocrine and EMS guidance, which they do [^9e849bbd] [^671227f5] [^a512297b].

> I need to ensure administration details are precise. Calcium gluconate should be diluted to 10–50 mg/mL for bolus and 5.8–10 mg/mL for infusion, with adult bolus not exceeding 200 mg/min and pediatric not exceeding 100 mg/min; continuous infusions warrant calcium and ECG monitoring, and extravasation precautions are essential to avoid calcinosis cutis and tissue necrosis, so secure IV access and vigilance are mandatory [^dc85b9df] [^96f42216].

> But wait, what about the ready-to-use sodium chloride premix formulation; does it require dilution? I should double-check the product-specific instructions. The calcium gluconate in sodium chloride injection is supplied as a dilute, ready-to-use solution and should not be further diluted prior to use, which is a key operational distinction from the concentrated vials that require dilution [^ca706a03].

> Next, I should review monitoring and safety. During intermittent dosing, check serum calcium every 4–6 hours; during continuous infusion, every 1–4 hours; monitor ECG when giving boluses, especially in hyperkalemia or toxicity settings; and watch for bradycardia, hypotension, and arrhythmias, particularly with rapid administration or in the setting of digoxin or calcium channel blockers [^dc85b9df] [^96f42216].

> I should confirm contraindications and key interactions. Hypercalcemia is a contraindication; in neonates, coadministration with ceftriaxone is contraindicated due to fatal precipitates, and in older patients sequential administration with line flushing is required if both are needed; calcium can precipitate with bicarbonate or phosphate, so avoid mixing; and calcium can potentiate digoxin toxicity, so if used together, administer slowly with ECG monitoring [^b51e4b88] [^0b1dfba7] [^07cbcd1b] [^6d78a352].

> Let me think about special populations and formulation nuances. In renal impairment, start at the low end of dosing and monitor calcium frequently; in hepatic impairment, dose adjustment is generally unnecessary because ionized calcium availability is not reduced; in pregnancy, treat symptomatic hypocalcemia given maternal-fetal risks, with limited but reassuring safety data for short-term IV use; and in neonates, remember aluminum toxicity risk with prolonged parenteral calcium, favoring plastic-packaged products when available to minimize aluminum exposure [^bb30c3ed] [^faa75e8d] [^712c5f9f] [^73b81bd3].

> Hold on, I should verify the comparative role of calcium chloride versus gluconate so I don't overgeneralize. Calcium chloride contains about three times more elemental calcium per 10 mL than calcium gluconate and is preferred in arrest or when rapid, high-dose calcium is needed, but it is more caustic and should be given centrally or with great caution peripherally; calcium gluconate is preferred for most non-arrest scenarios and for peripheral administration, especially in pediatrics [^9e5a77bf] [^760303f2].

> I will now synthesize a practical decision framework. Use calcium gluconate for acute symptomatic hypocalcemia, for hyperkalemia with ECG changes when not in arrest, for CCB or beta-blocker toxicity with hemodynamic compromise, and for HF burns with systemic involvement; avoid in hypercalcemia, use caution with digoxin, and in neonates avoid coadministration with ceftriaxone; tailor dosing to indication and age, monitor calcium and ECG as indicated, and escalate to calcium chloride when rapid, high-dose calcium is urgently required and access permits safe administration [^27dcf7be] [^760303f2] [^ccaa09f6] [^a9edf1ff] [^b51e4b88].

Calcium gluconate is a **parenteral calcium salt** used to treat acute symptomatic hypocalcemia [^27dcf7be] and to stabilize the myocardium in hyperkalemia with ECG changes [^a72ba9fd]. It is preferred over calcium chloride for peripheral administration because it is less irritating to veins, though it provides less elemental calcium per milliliter [^9e5a77bf]. Key safety issues include **extravasation injury** [^497b2e3a], arrhythmias with rapid infusion [^96f42216], and fatal precipitates with ceftriaxone in neonates [^0b1dfba7]; dosing must be individualized and titrated with close monitoring of serum calcium and ECG [^dc85b9df].

---

## Pharmacological properties

- **Mechanism of action**: Increases serum ionized calcium, restoring neuromuscular excitability and myocardial contractility [^39bf55e0].
- **Pharmacokinetics**: 100% bioavailable IV; ionized calcium is rapidly available and excreted renally [^39bf55e0].
- **Elemental calcium content**: 10% solution contains 9 mg/mL elemental calcium (0.465 mEq/mL) [^dc85b9df].

---

## Clinical indications

- **Primary indication**: Acute symptomatic hypocalcemia in adults and pediatrics [^27dcf7be] [^c49b9eb0].
- **Hyperkalemia**: Stabilizes cardiac membranes when ECG changes are present; preferred over calcium chloride in non-arrest settings [^760303f2] [^a72ba9fd].
- **CCB/beta-blocker toxicity**: First-line adjunct to improve hemodynamics [^ccaa09f6] [^56516c57].
- **Hydrofluoric acid burns**: Topical or IV to bind fluoride and prevent systemic hypocalcemia [^a9edf1ff] [^aefd9b73].

## Dosage and administration

| **Indication** | **Adult dose** | **Pediatric dose** | **Administration** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Hypocalcemia | 1–2 g IV over 10–20 min | 10–20 mg/kg elemental Ca IV over 10–20 min | Dilute to 10–50 mg/mL; max 200 mg/min adults, 100 mg/min pediatrics [^dc85b9df] |
| Hyperkalemia | 2–3 g IV over 5–10 min | 50–100 mg/kg IV over 5–10 min | Give with cardiac monitoring [^a72ba9fd] |
| CCB/beta-blocker toxicity | 3–6 g IV bolus or 0.6–1.2 mL/kg/h infusion | 60 mg/kg IV bolus or 60–120 mg/kg/h infusion | Titrate to BP/ionized calcium; monitor ECG [^194f856c] |

---

## Safety considerations and adverse effects

- **Extravasation**: Calcinosis cutis and tissue necrosis; use secure IV access and monitor closely [^497b2e3a] [^6d78a352].
- **Cardiac effects**: Bradycardia, arrhythmias, and hypotension with rapid infusion; infuse slowly with ECG monitoring [^96f42216] [^dc85b9df].
- **Drug interactions**: Avoid with ceftriaxone in neonates due to fatal precipitates; use sequentially with line flushing in older patients [^0b1dfba7] [^07cbcd1b].
- **Aluminum toxicity**: Risk with prolonged parenteral use, especially in neonates and renal impairment [^712c5f9f] [^96f42216].

---

## Comparison with calcium chloride

| **Parameter** | **Calcium gluconate** | **Calcium chloride** |
|-|-|-|
| Elemental calcium | 9 mg/mL (10% solution) | 27 mg/mL (10% solution) |
| Irritation | Lower; suitable for peripheral use | Higher; central line preferred |
| Onset | Slightly slower | Faster |
| Clinical use | - Hypocalcemia <br/> - Hyperkalemia <br/> - CCB/beta-blocker toxicity | - Cardiac arrest <br/> - Severe hyperkalemia <br/> - Massive transfusion |

---

## Special populations

In renal impairment, **start low and monitor calcium frequently** [^bb30c3ed]; in hepatic impairment, **no adjustment is needed** because ionized calcium availability is unaffected [^bb30c3ed]. In pregnancy, use when indicated; monitor mother and fetus for calcium-related complications [^faa75e8d].

---

Calcium gluconate is a **versatile, safer-for-periphery calcium salt** for acute hypocalcemia and hyperkalemia, with dosing individualized and safety monitoring essential to prevent extravasation, arrhythmias, and drug interactions [^27dcf7be] [^760303f2].

Rationale

The workgroup agreed that each of the treatments here mentioned could be considered as first line alone or in combination. A supplementary round of Delphi did not allow prioritization of one intervention over another. Comparative studies were rare, and more than one interventions were done concurrently in most of the studies reviewed. Therefore, the workgroup emphasized that the first-line treatments should be prioritized based on the desired effect tailored to the individual patient's clinical condition (Fig. 3; Supplemental Table 1, Supplemental Digital Content 2).

The workgroup recommended IV calcium as a first-line treatment based on improvement in contractility and blood pressure observed in some case series and animal studies. This therapy is readily available and carries little risk provided central venous or secure peripheral venous access is available. The regimen often used for the administration of 10% calcium chloride in CCB-poisoned adults is 10–20 mL (1–2 g) every 10–20 minutes or an infusion at 0.2–0.4 mL/kg/hr (0.02–0.04 g/kg/hr). When 10% calcium gluconate is given, notably to minimize peripheral vein irritation, the dose regimen frequently used is 30–60 mL (3–6 g) every 10–20 minutes or an infusion at 0.6–1.2 mL/kg/hr (0.06–0.12 g/kg/hr).

Regarding the use of calcium gluconate IV in pregnant patients for all trimesters: insufficient evidence. The limited data on use in pregnant women is insufficient to know this drug's risks, including the risk of fetal harm or reproductive effects. Hypocalcemia carries risks to the mother and fetus, including increased spontaneous abortion, dysfunctional or premature labor, and preeclampsia. Infants of mothers with hypocalcemia may have neonatal hyperparathyroidism, which may lead to fetal and neonatal skeletal demineralization, subperiosteal bone resorption, osteitis fibrosa cystica, and seizures. Carefully monitor infants of hypocalcemic mothers for abnormal calcium levels; signs include neuromuscular irritability, apnea, cyanosis, and cardiac arrhythmias.

12	CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

12.1	Mechanism of Action

Intravenous administration of calcium gluconate increases serum ionized calcium level. Calcium gluconate dissociates into ionized calcium in plasma. Ionized calcium and gluconate are constituents of body fluids.

12.3	Pharmacokinetics

Absorption

Calcium Gluconate Injection is 100% bioavailable following intravenous injection.

Metabolism

Calcium itself does not undergo direct metabolism. The release of ionized calcium from intravenous administration of calcium gluconate is direct and does not seem to be affected by the first pass through the liver.

Distribution

Calcium in the body is distributed mainly in skeleton (99%). Only 1% of the total body calcium is distributed within the extracellular fluids and soft tissues. About 50% of total serum calcium is in the ionized form and represents the biologically active part. 8% to 10% serum calcium is bound to organic and inorganic acid and approximately 40% is protein-bound (primarily to albumin).

Elimination

Studies have shown a relationship between urinary calcium excretion and the intravenous administration of calcium gluconate, with a significant increase in urinary calcium excretion observed after the intravenous administration of calcium gluconate.

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: sixth edition [^9e5a77bf]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Transfusion-induced hypocalcaemia, with ionised Ca 2+ levels below 0.9 mmol/L or serum total corrected calcium levels of 7.5 mg/dL or lower, should be corrected promptly, as ionised Ca 2+ levels below 0.8 mmol/L are associated with cardiac dysrhythmias. Importantly, however, it should be noted that while an association between admission ionised hypocalcaemia and mortality, increased blood transfusion and coagulopathy has been identified, no data demonstrate that the prevention or treatment of ionised hypocalcaemia reduces mortality in patients with critical bleeding requiring MT.

The preferred agent to correct hypocalcaemia is calcium chloride, 10 mL as a 10% solution contains 270 mg of elemental calcium. In comparison, 10 mL of 10% calcium gluconate contains only 90 mg of elemental calcium. Calcium chloride may also be preferable to calcium gluconate in the setting of abnormal liver function, where decreased citrate metabolism results in the slower release of ionised calcium.

Recombinant activated coagulation factor VII

Recommendation 32

We do not recommend the use of recombinant activated coagulation factor VII (rFVIIa) as first-line treatment (Grade 1B).

We suggest that the off-label use of rFVIIa be considered only if major bleeding and traumatic coagulopathy persist despite all other attempts to control bleeding, systemic homeostasis and best-practice use of conventional haemostatic measures (Grade 2C).

8.1 Pregnancy

Risk summary

Limited available data with Calcium Gluconate Injection use in pregnant women are insufficient to inform a drug associated risk of adverse developmental outcomes. There are risks to the mother and the fetus associated with hypocalcemia in pregnancy [see Clinical Considerations].

The estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage for the indicated population is unknown. In the U.S. general population, the estimated background risk of major birth defects and miscarriage in clinically recognized pregnancies is 2–4% and 15–20%, respectively.

Clinical Considerations

Disease-associated maternal risk

Maternal hypocalcemia can result in an increased rate of spontaneous abortion, premature and dysfunctional labor, and possibly preeclampsia.

Fetal/Neonatal adverse reactions

Infants born to mothers with hypocalcemia can have associated fetal and neonatal hyperparathyroidism, which in turn can cause fetal and neonatal skeletal demineralization, subperiosteal bone resorption, osteitis fibrosa cystica and neonatal seizures. Infants born to mothers with hypocalcemia should be carefully monitored for signs of hypocalcemia or hypercalcemia, including neuromuscular irritability, apnea, cyanosis and cardiac rhythm disorders.

8.2 Lactation

Risk summary

Calcium is present in human milk as a natural component of human milk. It is not known whether intravenous administration of Calcium Gluconate Injection can alter calcium concentration in human milk. There are no data on the effects of Calcium Gluconate Injection on the breastfed infant, or on milk production. The developmental and health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for Calcium Gluconate Injection and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed child from Calcium Gluconate Injection or from the underlying maternal condition.

National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines — hydrofluoric acid (HF) exposure management notes that HF "readily penetrates intact skin" and that "An oral or large dermal exposure can result in significant systemic hypocalcemia with possible QT prolongation and cardiovascular collapse". For confirmed or suspected exposure, "Vigorously irrigate all affected areas with water or normal saline for a minimum of 15 minutes", "Apply a cardiac monitor for oral or large dermal exposures significant HF exposures", and "Apply calcium preparation".

### The European guideline on management of major bleeding and coagulopathy following trauma: fifth edition [^20eb77b1]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

A retrospective study on patients who received massive transfusion and who developed hypocalcaemia (Ca 2+ < 1.12) showed that severe hypocalcaemia (Ca 2+ < 0.90) was associated with a significantly higher APTT, higher blood lactate levels, lower platelet count and lower blood pH compared with moderate hypocalcaemia (Ca 2+ ≥ 0.90). Patients in the Ca 2+ < 0.90 group received more blood products (34 vs 22 units) and mortality was significantly higher (49% vs 24%).

Transfusion-induced hypocalcaemia with ionised Ca 2+ levels below 0.9 mmol/L or serum total corrected calcium levels of 7.5 mg/dL or less requires prompt calcium replacement, as ionised Ca 2+ levels below 0.8 mmol/L are associated with cardiac dysrhythmias. The ionised calcium concentration should therefore be maintained within the normal range. However, no data are available to demonstrate that the prevention of ionised hypocalcaemia reduces mortality among patients with critical bleeding who require massive transfusion.

To correct hypocalcaemia, calcium chloride is preferred to calcium gluconate, as 10% calcium chloride contains 270 mg of elemental calcium per 10 mL, whereas 10% calcium gluconate contains 90 mg of elemental calcium per 10 mL. Calcium chloride may also be preferable to calcium gluconate in the presence of abnormal liver function, because decreased citrate metabolism results in slower release of ionised calcium.

Results of individual studies and risks of bias.

Gastrointestinal decontamination

Five human case series, including two pediatric studies, reported sequelae-free survival of all patients who underwent gastrointestinal decontamination (including activated charcoal, gastric lavage, and whole-bowel irrigation). Cardiac arrests following initiation of whole-bowel irrigation were documented in two case series of hemodynamically unstable patients, and following gastric lavage in one case report. In all cases, complications occurred after the patient began vomiting. Given the nature of these reports, neither survival nor cardiac arrest can be attributed, with confidence, to the decontamination procedures.

High-dose insulin

High-dose insulin (intravenous (IV) bolus of 1.0 unit/kg followed by a 0.5–2.0 unit/kg/h infusion) showed an improvement in hemodynamics in one of two human observational studies, all five human case series, and all four animal studiesassessing that outcome, while a survival benefit was reported in animal studies. Hypoglycemia (1 of 7and 2 of 4subjects) and hypokalemia (2 of 7and 2 of 4subjects) were reported as adverse effects in human cohort studies and case series, respectively.

Calcium

The majority of animal studiesevaluating use of calcium demonstrated a reduced mortality as well as hemodynamic improvement. Human case seriesand case reportsdemonstrated inconsistent benefits, but adverse effects such as hypercalcemia were rare. The dose employed was typically an IV single dose of calcium chloride (1–5 g), sometimes followed by an infusion, or the equivalent dose in calcium gluconate.

Recommended doses of elemental calcium are 30 to 75 mg/kg per day in 3 divided doses, and calcitriol may be necessary in doses of 20 to 100 ng/kg per day in 2 to 3 divided doses until calcium levels normalize. High doses of calcium are necessary early in the course of therapy, after which doses are reduced by half for the next 1 to 2 weeks.

### Comparison of neuromuscular blockade recovery co-administered with neostigmine and different doses of calcium gluconate: a randomized control trial [^620c54ba]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

It has been well-reported that the release of acetylcholine (Ach) at the neuromuscular junction is calcium-dependent. Calcium increases the probability of transmitter release at the neuromuscular junction. A brief calcium administration restrictively and immediately before the depolarizing phase accelerates transmitter release. However, the overall details of the role of ionized calcium for neuromuscular blockade (NMB) recovery by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AchEI) have not yet been clarified.

AchEIs such as neostigmine are widely used clinically for non-depolarizing NMB recovery. Neostigmine inhibits acetylcholinesterase and increases the Ach concentration at the neuromuscular junction to achieve neuromuscular function recovery. However, in addition to the pharmacodynamics between non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) and AchEIs, factors such as electrolyte abnormalities, anticholinesterase administration timing, body temperature, drug dosage, additional medications, and liver or kidney disease also affect neuromuscular recovery. Therefore, it is essential for anesthesiologists to take these various factors into consideration when recovering NMB.

To determine whether ionized calcium at different doses may have a quantitative effect, this study compared the neuromuscular recovery time and the incidence of postoperative residual curarization (PORC) according to the dosage of calcium gluconate co-administered with neostigmine in three patient groups: a 5 mg/kg calcium gluconate group (calcium 5 group), a 10 mg/kg calcium gluconate group (calcium 10 group), and a control group.

5.5 Aluminum Toxicity

Calcium Gluconate Injection contains aluminum, up to 512 mcg per liter, that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 mcg/kg/day to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration.

Complications due to pregnancy are among the leading causes of maternal deaths worldwide. According to a World Health Organization (WHO) 2015 report, approximately 830 women die every day from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth and 99% of these deaths occur in low-resource countries. The global distribution of maternal deaths is influenced by two regions, sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia, which account for the majority of all maternal deaths. In 2015, two countries, Nigeria and India, accounted for more than one-third of all global maternal deaths, with approximately 58,000 maternal deaths (19%) in Nigeria and 45,000 maternal deaths (15%) in India. Ten countries accounted for nearly 59% of global maternal deaths: in addition to Nigeria and India, they are the Democratic Republic of Congo (22,000), Ethiopia (11,000), Pakistan (9700), Tanzania (8200), Kenya (8000), Indonesia (6400), Uganda (5700), and Bangladesh (5500).

Although there may be controversy surrounding the indications for parathyroidectomy in primary hyperparathyroidism, it remains the only accepted definitive therapy. However, even if parathyroidectomy is indicated, some patients refuse surgery, are medically unfit or have residual or recurrent disease inaccessible to further surgery. Some of these patients may be suitable for long-term observation but others require intervention for management of symptomatic or moderate to severe hypercalcaemia, loss of bone mineral density or renal calculi.

2.5	Drug Incompatibilities

- Do not mix Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection with ceftriaxone. Concurrent use of intravenous ceftriaxone and Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection can lead to the formation of ceftriaxone-calcium precipitates. Concomitant use of ceftriaxone and intravenous calcium-containing products is contraindicated in neonates (28 days of age or younger) [see Contraindications (4)]. In patients older than 28 days of age, ceftriaxone and calcium-containing products may be administered sequentially, provided the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid. Ceftriaxone must not be administered simultaneously with intravenous calcium-containing solutions via a Y-site in any age group [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), Drug Interactions (7.3)].

- Do not mix Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection with fluids containing bicarbonate or phosphate. Calcium Gluconate Injection is not physically compatible with fluids containing phosphate or bicarbonate. Precipitation may result if mixed.

- Do not mix Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection with minocycline injection. Calcium complexes minocycline rendering it inactive.

### Parenteral calcium for intensive care unit patients [^f3341ab5]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Hypocalcemia is prevalent among critically ill patients requiring intensive care. Several epidemiological studies highlight a direct association between hypocalcemia and mortality. These data provide the impetus for current guidelines recommending parenteral calcium administration to normalize serum calcium. However, in light of the considerable variation in the threshold for calcium replacement, the lack of evidence to support a causal role of hypocalcemia in mortality, and animal studies illustrating that calcium supplementation may worsen outcomes, a systematic review is essential to evaluate whether or not the practice of calcium supplementation for intensive care unit (ICU) patients provides any benefit.

Objectives

To assess the effects of parenteral calcium administration in ICU patients on the following outcomes: mortality, multiple organ dysfunction, ICU and hospital length of stay, costs, serum ionized calcium concentration, and complications of parenteral calcium administration.

Search Strategy

We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Controlled Trials, and the National Research Register. We hand-searched conference abstracts from the Society of Critical Care Medicine, the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, the American Thoracic Surgery, the American College of Surgeons, the American College of Chest Physicians, the American College of Physicians, and the International Consensus Conference in Intensive Care Medicine. We checked references of publications and attempted to contact authors to identify additional published or unpublished data.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled and controlled clinical trials of ICU patients comparing parenteral calcium chloride or calcium gluconate administration with no treatment or placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers independently applied eligibility criteria to trial reports for inclusion and extracted data.

Main Results

There are no identifiable studies that have evaluated the association between parenteral calcium supplementation in critically ill ICU patients and the following outcomes: mortality, multiple organ dysfunction, ICU and hospital length of stay, costs, and complications of calcium administration. Serum ionized calcium concentration was reported in 5 studies (12 trial arms, 159 participants). These trials showed a small but significant increase in serum ionized calcium concentration after calcium administration. These trials showed considerable statistical heterogeneity and differed extensively in the population studied (adult versus neonate), the indication (hypocalcemia versus prophylaxis) and threshold of hypocalcemia for which parenteral calcium was administered, and the timing of subsequent measurement of serum ionized calcium concentration to the extent that we consider a pooled estimate almost inappropriate.

Authors' Conclusions

There is no clear evidence that parenteral calcium supplementation impacts the outcome of critically ill patients.

### Comparison of neuromuscular blockade recovery co-administered with neostigmine and different doses of calcium gluconate: a randomized control trial [^3cd01e90]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Calcium increases the probability of transmitter release at the neuromuscular junction. It is not known whether there is a dose-dependent relationship between the dosage of calcium gluconate and the probability of transmitter release for non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade (NMB) recovery by acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AchEIs). This study compared the neuromuscular recovery time and the incidence of postoperative residual curarization (PORC) according to the dosage of calcium gluconate co-administered with neostigmine in three patient groups.

Methods

Patients were randomly allocated to a control group, a 5 mg/kg calcium gluconate group (calcium 5 group), or a 10 mg/kg calcium gluconate group (calcium 10 group). In patients with a TOF ratio (TOFr) between 0.2–0.7, 0.04 mg/kg of neostigmine was administered and both 0.2 mg of glycopyrrolate and 0.4 mg of atropine per 1 mg of neostigmine were administered. And additional 5 or 10 mg/kg of calcium gluconate were administrated to the calcium 5 and 10 groups. The primary endpoint was neuromuscular recovery time (the time between reversal and TOFr ≥ 0.9). The secondary endpoints were the incidence of PORC at 5, 10, and 20 min after reversal administration and the train-of-four ratio (TOFr) at each time point.

Results

The neuromuscular recovery time was 5.3 min in the control group, 3.9 min in the calcium 5 group, and 4.1 min in the calcium 10 group, respectively (P = 0.004). The incidence of PORC at 5 min after neostigmine administration was 12 in the control group, 4 in the calcium 5 group, and 4 in the calcium 10 group, respectively, with statistical significance (P = 0.014).

Conclusions

The co-administration of calcium gluconate with neostigmine safely promoted early NMB recovery, and the neuromuscular recovery time of the calcium 10 group tended to be more evenly distributed than that of the calcium 5 group.

### A.S.P.E.N. clinical guidelines: parenteral nutrition ordering, order review, compounding, labeling, and dispensing [^7c413da8]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Parenteral nutrition (PN) is a high-alert medication available for patient care within a complex clinical process. Beyond application of best practice recommendations to guide safe use and optimize clinical outcome, several issues are better addressed through evidence-based policies, procedures, and practices. This document provides evidence-based guidance for clinical practices involving PN prescribing, order review, and preparation.

Method

A systematic review of the best available evidence was used by an expert work group to answer a series of questions about PN prescribing, order review, compounding, labeling, and dispensing. Concepts from the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) format were applied as appropriate. The specific clinical guideline recommendations were developed using consensus prior to review and approval by the American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (A.S.P.E.N.) Board of Directors. The following questions were addressed: (1) Does education of prescribers improve PN ordering? (2) What is the maximum safe osmolarity of PN admixtures intended for peripheral vein administration? (3) What are the appropriate calcium intake and calcium-phosphate ratios in PN for optimal neonatal bone mineralization? (4) What are the clinical advantages or disadvantages of commercially available premade ("premixed") multichambered PN formulations compared with traditional/customized PN formulations? (5) What are the clinical (infection, catheter occlusion) advantages or disadvantages of 2-in-1 compared with 3-in-1 PN admixtures? (6) What macronutrient dosing limits are expected to provide for the most stable 3-in-1 admixtures? (7) What are the most appropriate recommendations for optimizing calcium (gluconate) and (Na- or K-) phosphate compatibility in PN admixtures? (8) What micronutrient contamination is present in parenteral stock solutions currently used to compound PN admixtures? (9) Is it safe to use the PN admixture as a vehicle for non-nutrient medication delivery? (10) Should heparin be included in the PN admixture to reduce the risk of central vein thrombosis? (11) What methods of repackaging intravenous fat emulsion (IVFE) into smaller patient-specific volumes are safe? (12) What beyond-use date should be used for (a) IVFE dispensed for separate infusion in the original container and (b) repackaged IVFE?

### American Thyroid Association statement on postoperative hypoparathyroidism: diagnosis, prevention, and management in adults [^474ca296]. Thyroid (2018). Medium credibility.

Postoperative hypoparathyroidism — management when symptoms progress or become severe: If symptoms progress and serum calcium remains < 7 mg/dL, magnesium levels should be measured and supplemented as needed; if severe symptomatic hypocalcemia develops despite oral calcium and calcitriol, a 12-lead EKG should be performed, corrected QT interval measured, and intravenous calcium administered. For rapid correction, an i.v. bolus (1–2 g of calcium gluconate [93 mg elemental calcium in one vial of calcium gluconate] in 50 mL of 5% dextrose infused over 20 min) can be used; calcium gluconate (90 mg of elemental calcium per 10 mL) is preferred for peripheral i.v. repletion, whereas calcium chloride (270 mg of elemental calcium per 10 mL) is prone to phlebitis and local tissue necrosis unless delivered through a central line or appropriately diluted.

### Successful treatment of propafenone-induced cardiac arrest by calcium gluconate [^80034ba2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Propafenone is prescribed for the control of cardiac ventricular arrhythmias. Poisoning from propafenone intoxication is rare, but the survival rate of patients is low. We present a case of a 37-year-old man who developed cardiac arrest due to propafenone intoxication. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation, plasmapheresis, and other medical treatments had no effect on cardiac arrest. After repeated administrations of calcium gluconate, the patient achieved a full recovery. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report in which a full recovery from cardiac arrest was achieved by administration of calcium gluconate. We recommend that for patients poisoned by propafenone, close monitoring for decreased blood calcium is important.

### A national model for developing, implementing, and evaluating evidence-based guidelines for prehospital care [^271c53f3]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2012). Medium credibility.

General medical hyperglycemia — prehospital management directs providers to provide volume expansion with normal saline bolus; adult dosing is normal saline 20 mL/kg at rate of 1000 mL/hr, and pediatric dosing is normal saline 10 mL/kg bolus IV, reassess, and repeat up to 40 mL/kg total; if symptoms of hypovolemic shock, follow Shock Guideline. If findings of hyperkalemia are present, administer IV fluids and consider administration of calcium chloride 1 gm IV/IO over 5 minutes (do not exceed 1 mL per minute) OR calcium gluconate 2 gm IV/IO over 5 minutes with constant cardiac monitoring. If findings of hyperkalemia, consider administration of sodium bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg (max dose of 50 mEq) IV bolus over 5 minutes and consider albuterol 5 mg via nebulizer (can be repeated if no response is seen). Reassess patient status, including vital signs, mental status, and signs of dehydration, and if mental status changes, reassess blood glucose level and provide appropriate treatment if hypoglycemia has developed. Disposition guidance is to transport to closest appropriate receiving facility. Patient safety notes state that overly aggressive administration of fluid in hyperglycemic patients may cause cerebral edema or dangerous hyponatremia, and that cerebral edema is a leading cause of death in children with DKA but is very rare in adults; closely monitor for signs of altered mental status and increased intracranial pressure, immediately discontinue IV fluids and elevate head of bed if signs of increased ICP develop; asymptomatic hyperglycemia poses no risk to the patient while inappropriately aggressive interventions to manage blood sugar may harm patients.

5.4	Hypotension, Bradycardia, and Cardiac Arrhythmias with Rapid Administration

Rapid injection of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection may cause vasodilation, decreased blood pressure, bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmias, syncope and cardiac arrest. To avoid adverse reactions that may follow rapid intravenous administration, Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection should be infused slowly. If rapid intravenous bolus of Calcium Gluconate Injection is required, the rate of intravenous administration should not exceed 200 mg/minute in adults and 100 mg/minute in pediatric patients and ECG monitoring during administration is recommended [see Dosage and Administration (2.1)].

5.5	Aluminum Toxicity

Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection contains aluminum, up to 25 mcg per liter, that may be toxic. Aluminum may reach toxic levels with prolonged parenteral administration if kidney function is impaired. Premature neonates are particularly at risk because their kidneys are immature, and they require large amounts of calcium and phosphate solutions, which contain aluminum. Research indicates that patients with impaired kidney function, including premature neonates, who receive parenteral levels of aluminum at greater than 4 mcg/kg/day to 5 mcg/kg/day accumulate aluminum levels associated with central nervous system and bone toxicity. Tissue loading may occur at even lower rates of administration.

- **Cardiac Glycoside**: Synergistic arrhythmias may occur if calcium and cardiac glycosides are administered together. (7.1)

- **Calcium Channel Blockers**: Administration of calcium may reduce the response. (7.2)

- **Drugs that may cause hypercalcemia**: Vitamin D, vitamin A, thiazide diuretics, estrogen, calcipotriene and teriparatide administration may cause hypercalcemia. Monitor plasma calcium concentrations in patients taking these drugs concurrently. (7.3)

7.1	Cardiac Glycosides

Hypercalcemia increases the risk of digoxin toxicity, while digoxin may be therapeutically ineffective in the presence of hypocalcemia. Synergistic arrhythmias may occur if calcium and cardiac glycosides are administered together. Avoid administration of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection in patients receiving cardiac glycosides; if considered necessary, administer Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection slowly in small amounts and monitor ECG closely during administration.

7.2	Calcium Channel Blockers

Administration of calcium may reduce the response to calcium channel blockers.

### Pharmacologic treatment of primary osteoporosis or low bone mass to prevent fractures in adults: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^66941292]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Clinical considerations — general management in adults with low bone mass or osteoporosis: Clinicians should prescribe generic medications if possible rather than more expensive brand-name medications. Clinicians treating adults with osteoporosis should encourage adherence to recommended treatments and healthy lifestyle modifications, including exercise, and counseling for evaluation and prevention of falls. Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake should be part of fracture prevention in all adults with low bone mass or osteoporosis. Clinicians should assess baseline risk for fracture based on individualized assessment of bone density, history of fractures, response to prior treatments for osteoporosis, and multiple risk factors for fractures, noting that there are many available risk assessment tools with varying predictive value, which were not evaluated in the systematic review or in this guideline.

### Calcium gluconate (calcium gluconate in sodium chloride) [^6d78a352]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

5.1	Arrhythmias with Concomitant Cardiac Glycoside Use

Cardiac arrhythmias may occur if calcium and cardiac glycosides are administered together. Hypercalcemia increases the risk of digoxin toxicity. Administration of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection should be avoided in patients receiving cardiac glycosides. If concomitant therapy is necessary, Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection should be given slowly in small amounts and with close ECG monitoring [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

5.2	End-Organ Damage due to Intravascular Ceftriaxone-Calcium Precipitates

Concomitant use of ceftriaxone and Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection is contraindicated in neonates (28 days of age or younger) due to cases of fatal outcomes in neonates in which a crystalline material was observed in the lungs and kidneys at autopsy after ceftriaxone and calcium were administrated simultaneously through the same intravenous line. Concomitant administration can lead to the formation of ceftriaxone-calcium precipitates that may act as emboli, resulting in vascular spasm or infarction [see Contraindications (4)].

In patients older than 28 days of age, ceftriaxone and Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection may be administered sequentially, provided the infusion lines are thoroughly flushed between infusions with a compatible fluid. Do not administer Ceftriaxone simultaneously with Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection via a Y-site in any age group.

5.3	Tissue Necrosis and Calcinosis

Intravenous administration of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection and local trauma may result in calcinosis cutis due to transient increase in local calcium concentration. Calcinosis cutis can occur with or without extravasation of Calcium Gluconate in Sodium Chloride Injection, is characterized by abnormal dermal deposits of calcium salts, and clinically manifests as papules, plaques, or nodules that may be associated with erythema, swelling, or induration. Tissue necrosis, ulceration, and secondary infection are the most serious complications.

If extravasation occurs or clinical manifestations of calcinosis cutis are noted, immediately discontinue intravenous administration at that site and treat as needed.

### Prehospital blood transfusion coalition clinical practice guideline for civilian emergency medical services [^e28c5381]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Prehospital principles of resuscitation and transfusion

Rapid recognition of life-threatening hemorrhagic shock: Clinical assessment remains the cornerstone for recognition, including physiological parameters such as vital signs, shock index, end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO₂), and others. Consider point-of-care testing devices if available, such as lactate measurement.
Hemorrhage control with appropriate adjuncts: Pressure dressings and wound packing (preferably with hemostatic products) for severe wounds. Tourniquets for significant extremity hemorrhage. Pelvic binders for suspected pelvic fractures. Wound packing or junctional tourniquets for junctional hemorrhage.
Vascular access must be promptly obtained: Intravenous access (18 g or greater) is preferred. If intravenous access cannot be rapidly established, obtain intraosseous access. Humeral intraosseous access is preferred over tibial access due to significantly higher flow rates.
Hemostatic resuscitation: WB when available. Low-titer O WB. Plasma. Packed RBCs. Aim for balanced 1:1 ratio of plasma to RBCs when possible.
Minimize crystalloid use: Limit crystalloid resuscitation to less than 500 mL. Excessive crystalloid worsens coagulopathy and contributes to hemodilution.
Prevent hypothermia: Use appropriate warming devices for blood products. Maintain patient temperature with passive warming measures. Consider active warming devices when available.
Tranexamic Acid (TXA) administration: For patients who will receive blood and are within 3 hours of injury. Adult dose options: 2 g intravenous/intraosseous once. 1 g intravenous/intraosseous over 10 min, followed by 1 g over 8 hours. Pediatric dose: 15 mg/kg (maximum 1 gram) intravenous over 10 min.
Calcium replacement: Consider calcium intravenous after 2 units of blood products have been administered and after other hemostatic interventions are completed. Calcium Gluconate 3 g (less caustic to tissue). Calcium chloride 1 g. Monitor for signs of hypercalcemia. Pediatric dose: 60 mg/kg calcium gluconate. 20 mg/kg calcium chloride. Flush the line with a minimum of 10 mL of saline Monitor closely for signs of intravenous/intraosseous infiltration/extravasation.

### The amount of calcium in calcium chloride-is there a need to clarify emergency treatment of hyperkalaemia algorithm? [^c39d401a]. Resuscitation (2022). Medium credibility.

European Resuscitation Council (ERC) and American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines emphasize a rapid administration of calcium chloride (10 mL 10% CaCl 2) to protect the myocardium in the hyperkalaemia algorithm. However, calcium chloride preparations available in European markets vary from country to country. In our opinion, the drug dose recommended in the guidelines should not raise questions about the volume and amount of calcium in the intravenous supply and should be unambiguous to minimize the risk of error. Calcium dose should be given in terms of mmol/L or mEq or mg of calcium ions.

### A quality improvement project for managing hypocalcemia after pediatric total thyroidectomy [^57fb1468]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives Hypocalcemia following total thyroidectomy (TT) is relatively common. It may result in significant morbidity, prolonged hospital stay, and increased costs. Treatment with intravenous (IV) calcium gluconate may also carry significant risks. In pediatrics, management consensus guidelines are lacking. Methods At Phoenix Children's Hospital, a team of pediatric endocrinologists, surgeons and otolaryngologists developed a clinical pathway for patients undergoing TT. It was a Quality Improvement (QI) project with the primary aim of decreasing IV calcium gluconate use from a baseline of 68% to less than 40% over 15 months. Secondary aims included reducing hypocalcemia and length of hospitalization. Interventions included sending weekly pathway reminder emails, starting pre-operative calcium, and pathway implementation into the electronic health record. Results Twenty-seven patients underwent TT over 15 months. IV calcium gluconate use dropped to 48%. Hypocalcemia and length of hospitalization were 96% and 52.7 h (range 21.1–115.7) respectively. Pathway adherence improved after targeted interventions. Eleven (73%) of the 15 patients whose post-operative parathyroid hormone (PTH) nadir was below 15 pg/mL required IV calcium gluconate vs. two (17%) out of 12 with levels above this threshold. Conclusions Standardizing care allowed for objective outcome analysis. We learned that post-operative serum PTH level was the main risk factor for requiring IV calcium gluconate. Implementing the pathway as a QI project allows for revisions based on outcomes, ultimately resulting in a pathway that best utilizes our infrastructure to optimize care. Other pediatric institutions may face similar challenges and can potentially learn from our experience.

### Comparison of neuromuscular blockade recovery co-administered with neostigmine and different doses of calcium gluconate: a randomized control trial [^9c34206f]. BMC Anesthesiology (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

General characteristics of the enrolled subjects

A total of 90 patients were recruited for this trial. They were divided into 3 groups: the control group (n = 30), calcium 5 group (n = 30), and calcium 10 group (n = 30). Due to various reasons for dropout, 4 from each group (about 13%) were eliminated. Twelve patients were excluded from analysis after randomization because of hyper−/hypocalcemia prior to emergence from anesthesia, consent withdrawal, or ICU admission after surgery (Fig. 1). Finally, 78 patients were included in the analysis. Differences in patient characteristics, preoperative serum calcium and magnesium concentrations, and intraoperative data were not significant among the three groups (Table 1).

Conclusions

The co-administration of calcium gluconate with neostigmine safely promoted early NMB recovery, and the neuromuscular recovery time of the calcium 10 group tended to be more evenly distributed than that of the calcium 5 group. Therefore it is expected to be more effective in obtaining the desired result of enhancing early neuromuscular recovery than control group and calcium 5 group.

Topical chemical burn (hydrofluoric acid exposure) — prehospital care emphasizes calcium-based therapy and symptom recognition: "Calcium gel is the foundation of pain control" for what "is very painful" exposure, and "While intravenous pain medications may be less effective, they should be added to calcium gel to assist with pain control". Hydrofluoric acid exposure "typically causes pain out of proportion to the visible dermal effects" and "Minimal skin changes may exist with substantial exposures". For digital involvement, "apply the calcium gel to the hand, squirt additional calcium gel into a surgical glove, and then insert the affected hand into the glove", and "Leave in place for at least 20 minutes then reassess; this can be repeated as needed". For ingestion or large dermal exposure, "consider intravenous calcium gluconate, 1–2 grams of 10% solution", because symptomatic hypocalcemia can precipitate rapidly with "muscle spasms, seizures, hypotension ventricular arrhythmias, and QT prolongation".

### Bone in parathyroid diseases revisited: evidence from epidemiological, surgical and new drug outcomes [^1efd065d]. Endocrine Reviews (2025). Medium credibility.

Preventing signs and symptoms of hypocalcemia, maintaining serum calcium levels in the low normal range or slightly below normal, preventing hypercalciuria and hypercalcemia, keeping the calcium-phosphate product below 55 mg²/dL², and preventing renal (nephrocalcinosis/nephrolithiasis) and other extraskeletal calcifications are the main objectives of treatment. Conventional therapy of HypoPTH includes not only the emergency management of acute and severe hypocalcemia with IV administration of calcium gluconate, but also the management of chronic hypocalcemia with calcium, calcitriol, as well as magnesium supplements, whenever required. The normalization of serum calcium levels through traditional treatment involving calcium and active vitamin D fails to fully restore normal calcium homeostasis physiology. Instead, it leads to hypercalciuria and hyperphosphatemia because it lacks renal calcium reabsorption and phosphaturia typically stimulated by PTH. Consequently, this standard approach heightens the risk of extraskeletal calcifications and long-term kidney complications. Moreover, the absence of PTH results in abnormal bone remodeling and contributes to reduced quality of life for many hypoparathyroidism patients despite adhering to conventional therapy. These challenges have prompted scientific exploration into alternative therapeutic avenues. Since the mid-1990s, synthetic PTH (1–34) has been proposed for the management of refractory HypoPTH, with promising results. rhPTH (1–84) has been approved for the treatment of adults with HypoPTH refractory to conventional therapy, with the exception of patients who have autosomal dominant hypocalcemia.

Calcium channel blocker poisoning/overdose — prehospital clinical considerations include that "The avoidance of administering calcium chloride or calcium gluconate to a patient on cardiac glycosides (e.g., digoxin) as this may precipitate toxicity and associate fatal arrhythmias is felt to be a historical belief and not supported". "Glucagon has a side effect of increased vomiting at these doses and ondansetron prophylaxis should be considered". "A single pill can kill a toddler. It is very important that a careful assessment of medications the toddler could have access to is done by EMS and suspect medications brought into the ED". "Calcium channel blockers can cause many types of rhythms that can range from sinus bradycardia to complete heart block". "Hyperglycemia is the result of the blocking of L-type calcium channels in the pancreas. This can help differentiate these ingestions from beta-blockers. There may also be a relationship between the severity of the ingestion and the extent of the hyperglycemia". "Atropine may have little or no effect (likely to be more helpful in mild overdoses)", and "Hypotension and bradycardia may be mutually exclusive, and the blood pressure may not respond to correction of bradycardia".

### Assessing the efficacy and safety of calcium gluconate soaking as a treatment modality for hydrofluoric acid burns [^948b37bd]. Burns (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hydrofluoric acid is extremely toxic and can corrode tissues while reacting with calcium and magnesium, leading to severe tissue damage. The antidote, calcium gluconate, is effective for treating mild to moderate burns. However, our hospital lacks registered calcium gluconate gel, making treatment challenging. We investigated alternative soaking methods due to scant literature on this approach.

Methods

This retrospective case series study reviews hydrofluoric acid burn cases at China Medical University Hospital from 2004 and 2020, focusing on the effectiveness of calcium gluconate soaking. Among 29 patients treated for hydrofluoric acid burns in our emergency department, treatments included nail removal and debridement, but all received calcium gluconate soaks without requiring calcium injections.

Results

In our emergency department, 29 patients with hydrofluoric acid burns were treated; 8 required hospitalization and one was admitted to the intensive care unit. Burns varied widely in acid concentration (0.03%-49%) and size (1.60 ± 2.93% body surface area). Treatments included nail removal for one patient and debridement for four. All patients underwent calcium gluconate soaking; none received intra-arterial or subcutaneous injections. There were no fatalities or significant electrolyte imbalances.

Discussion

Calcium gluconate soaking is effective for treating mild HF burns in the absence of gel. However, the lack of a control group limits the ability to compare its efficacy to other treatments.

Conclusion

Calcium gluconate soaking may serve as a practical alternative for treating minor HF burns.

### Association between hypocalcemia and mortality in trauma patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^7f84942f]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2025). Medium credibility.

There is currently no guideline specifying the timing of calcium measurement in trauma patients, so clinicians should be vigilant for trauma-induced hypocalcemia. The European guideline recommends promptly correcting serum calcium levels below 7.5 mg/dL or serum iCa below 0.9 mmol/L in trauma patients who have received a blood transfusion. Calcium chloride is the preferred supplement because it contains approximately three times more element calcium than calcium gluconate; however, due to its high potential to irritate veins and surrounding tissues, it should be administered via a central line. The role of prophylactic calcium administration remains unclear and requires further study to analyze the optimal endpoint for calcium repletion.

Regarding the necessity of calcium supplements, no set procedure has demonstrated their advantages. Moore et al supported administering 1 g of calcium gluconate for every 1–2 units of blood product infused, emphasizing that iCa levels should be monitored early and frequently in patients with hemorrhagic shock. Additionally, in the presence of MT, Wade et al conducted a retrospective study on trauma patients with MT to evaluate the relationship between increased intravenous calcium administration during MT and survival, using the calcium-to-blood product ratio (CBR) as a measure. Their findings suggest that a CBR of 50 or higher within the first 4 hours of resuscitation was associated with improved survival, which translates to approximately 1 g of calcium gluconate for every 5 units of blood product. However, Helsloot et al found no significant difference in coagulopathy or transfusion requirement between patients with hypocalcemia (iCa < 1.10 mmol/L) and those with hypercalcemia (iCa ≥ 1.30 mmol/L). Their study does not support routine early empiric calcium supplementation. Thus, early calcium administration in trauma patients receiving a blood transfusion to prevent hypocalcemia still requires validation through large prospective studies.

### Maternal adverse effects of different antenatal magnesium sulphate regimens for improving maternal and infant outcomes: a systematic review [^a6155cf1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2013). Low credibility.

Subgroup analysis by regimen for administration

To explore the effect of aspects of the regimen for administration of magnesium sulphate on adverse effects, the trials from Comparison 1 were grouped as pre-specified where possible according to their dosage and/or route of administration (loading dose only; loading plus maintenance dose; 4 g IV loading dose plus any maintenance; 5–6 g IV loading dose plus any maintenance; 1 g/hour IV maintenance; 2–3 g/hour IV maintenance; IM maintenance).

For the outcomes maternal death, cardiac arrest, respiratory arrest and use of calcium gluconate, no significant differences were shown between the magnesium sulphate and no magnesium sulphate groups for any of the subgroups, and the subgroup interaction tests for all outcomes indicated no significant differential effects across the treatment subgroups (see Table 1 for effect estimates for regimen subgroups and Additional file 5 for forest plots). The significantly increased risk of discontinuing treatment due to adverse effects and experiencing 'any side effects' for the magnesium sulphate group was seen across all of the different regimen subgroups (see Analyses 1.4 and 1.7); for both outcomes, the subgroup interaction tests did not indicate differential effects according to the subgroups.

### Dietary supplements and prevention of preeclampsia [^4de957b2]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

By contrast, excessive calcium intake is not entirely free of concern: although the conclusions of the recent meta-analyses regarding the association between excessive calcium intake and cardiovascular disease risk differs, there are several reports indicating that calcium supplementation (> 1000 mg/day) increases the risk of cardiovascular side effects. Considering that the average daily calcium intake of women of reproductive age in Japan is approximately 500 mg, and the tolerable upper limit of calcium intake established by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare is 2500 mg/day, calcium supplementation of 1000–1500 mg is generally safe. Considering the above, low-dose supplementation (500 mg) is reasonable from the standpoint of cost and effort of high-dose supplementation.

Although there is insufficient evidence on the timing of prophylactic supplementation, it is recommended to start as soon as possible after pregnancy confirmation. The benefits of calcium supplementation before or at the beginning of pregnancy are not well established. Regarding the type of calcium supplementation, calcium citrate, calcium carbonate, and calcium gluconate are available options, but calcium carbonate is considered the most cost-effective. Calcium carbonate is inexpensive and more bioavailable than calcium gluconate; however, its absorption may be reduced if consumed between meals. The bioavailability of calcium citrate is not affected by diet; however, its high cost and the nearly 50% lower calcium content by weight are notable disadvantages. Calcium is typically consumed as a dietary supplement. From the insurance coverage perspective in Japan, L-aspartate calcium can be prescribed because the indications on the drug information for L-aspartate calcium state "calcium supplementation during pregnancy and lactation". Thus, low-dose calcium supplementation (500 mg/day) is recommended during pregnancy in regions with low calcium intake, including in Japan

### Hypocalcaemia in patients with prostate cancer treated with a bisphosphonate or denosumab: prevention supports treatment completion [^c5dbd4a6]. BMC Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Severe hypocalcaemia

For symptomatic or at-risk patients, or those possibly/probably non-compliant with oral calcium supplement, intravenous calcium should be administered if corrected serum calcium concentration falls below 1.9 mmol/l (ionized calcium < 1.0 mmol/l; i.e.g.rade ≥ 2). Asymptomatic patients with a corrected serum calcium below 1.9 mmol/l can rapidly become critically ill, and so it is important to treat and monitor these patients closely.

Intravenously administered calcium gluconate (10%) is preferred to calcium chloride, which is a strong irritant. It can be given as repeated 50–100 mL boluses in 5% dextrose or by continuous infusion. If calcium chloride is given, it should be administered via a central line to prevent irritation of veins. In order to avoid precipitation of calcium salts, phosphate and bicarbonate should not be infused with the calcium. Patients with severe hypocalcaemia should also receive oral calcium supplements (as described above) and vitamin D (e.g. 50,000 IU each week for 8 weeks or calcitriol 0.5–1 μg/day for patients with hypoparathyroidism) as needed. Treatment should be repeated until symptoms have subsided. It should be noted that hypocalcaemia can be prolonged, so continuous administration of a dilute solution of calcium for a few days may be required. Magnesium replacement should also be given (as described above) to those who are hypomagnesaemic. Cardiac monitoring during intravenous calcium administration is recommended because the rapid elevation of serum calcium concentration required to correct hypocalcaemia can result in cardiac arrhythmia.

### Treatment of acute hypocalcemia in critically ill multiple-trauma patients [^ea54184e]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Recent data indicate that critically ill, adult multiple trauma patients receiving specialized nutrition support commonly experience hypocalcemia (ionized serum calcium [iCa] ≤ 1.12 mmol/L). However, validated methods for the treatment of acute hypocalcemia are lacking.

Methods

The efficacy of a single dose of calcium gluconate using an empiric IV calcium gluconate graduated dosing regimen was evaluated in 37 patients. Patients with an iCa of 1–1.12 mmol/L (mild hypocalcemia) were provided 1–2 g of IV calcium gluconate. Patients with an iCa of < 1 mmol/L (moderate to severe hypocalcemia) were given 2–4 g. The calcium gluconate was infused at a rate of 1 g/h in a small-volume admixture. Serum iCa determination was repeated on the following day.

Results

One to 2 g of IV calcium gluconate was effective in normalizing iCa for 23 out of 29 patients (79%) with mild hypocalcemia and 2–4 g was effective for 3 of 8 patients (38%) with moderate to severe hypocalcemia. The individual response to calcium therapy (g/d) or when normalized to body weight (mg/kg/d) was highly variable.

Conclusions

One to 2 g of IV calcium gluconate were effective for most patients with mild hypocalcemia; however, treatment of moderate to severe hypocalcemia with 2–4 g of IV calcium gluconate was often unsuccessful. Further study with frequent serial ionized serum calcium and phosphorus determinations and electrocardiographic monitoring appears to be indicated for patients with moderate to severe hypocalcemia.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists / American college of endocrinology clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis-2020 update [^c14bb6d5]. Endocrine Practice (2020). High credibility.

Calcium supplement formulations and dosing — Calcium carbonate has a generous calcium content (40%), may cause gastrointestinal complaints, requires gastric acid for absorption, and is best absorbed when taken with meals, whereas calcium citrate has a lower calcium content (21%), absorption is not dependent on gastric acid, and it may be less likely to cause GI complaints; in addition to tablets, chewable supplements as well as gummy preparations are available. For optimal absorption, calcium supplementation should not exceed 500 to 600 mg per dose, irrespective of the preparation, and for patients requiring more than 600 mg of calcium supplement daily, the dose should be divided.

### Controversies in management of hyperkalemia [^839a273b]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Hyperkalemia is a common electrolyte disorder that can result in morbidity and mortality if not managed appropriately.

Objectives

This review evaluates the classic treatments of hyperkalemia and discusses controversies and new medications for management.

Discussion

Potassium (K+) plays a key role in determining the transmembrane potentials of "excitable membranes" present in nerve and muscle cells. K+ is the predominant intracellular cation, and clinical deterioration typically ensues when patients develop sufficiently marked elevation in extracellular fluid concentrations of K+ (hyperkalemia). Hyperkalemia is usually detected via serum clinical laboratory measurement. The most severe effect of hyperkalemia includes various cardiac dysrhythmias, which may result in cardiac arrest and death. Treatment includes measures to "stabilize" cardiac membranes, to shift K+ from extracellular to intracellular stores, and to promote K+ excretion. Calcium gluconate 10% dosed 10 mL intravenously should be provided for membrane stabilization, unless the patient is in cardiac arrest, in which case 10 mL calcium chloride is warranted. Beta-agonists and intravenous insulin should be given, and some experts recommend the use of synthetic short-acting insulins rather than regular insulin. Dextrose should also be administered, as indicated by initial and serial serum glucose measurements. Dialysis is the most efficient means to enable removal of excess K+. Loop and thiazide diuretics can also be useful. Sodium polystyrene sulfonate is not efficacious. New medications to promote gastrointestinal K+ excretion, which include patiromer and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate, hold promise.

Conclusions

Hyperkalemia can be deadly, and treatment requires specific measures including membrane stabilization, cellular shift, and excretion.

### Aluminum and phthalates in calcium gluconate: contribution from glass and plastic packaging [^73b81bd3]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Aluminum contamination of parenteral nutrition solutions has been documented for 3 decades. It can result in elevated blood, bone, and whole body aluminum levels associated with neurotoxicity, reduced bone mass and mineral content, and perhaps hepatotoxicity. The primary aluminum source among parenteral nutrition components is glass-packaged calcium gluconate, in which aluminum concentration in the past 3 decades has averaged approximately 4000 μg/L, compared with < 200 μg/L in plastic container-packaged calcium gluconate. A concern about plastic packaging is leaching of plasticizers, including phthalates, which have the potential to cause endocrine (male reproductive system) disruption and neurotoxicity.

Methods

Aluminum was quantified in samples collected periodically for more than 2 years from 3 calcium gluconate sources used to prepare parenteral nutrition solutions; 2 packaged in glass (from France and the United States) and 1 in plastic (from Germany); in a recently released plastic-packaged solution (from the United States); and in the 2 glass containers. Phthalate concentration was determined in selected samples of each product and leachate of the plastic containers.

Results

The initial aluminum concentration was approximately 5000 μg/L in the 2 glass-packaged products and approximately 20 μg/L in the plastic-packaged product, and increased approximately 30%, 50%, and 100% in 2 years, respectively. The aluminum concentration in a recently released Calcium Gluconate Injection USP was approximately 320 μg/L. Phthalates were not detected in any calcium gluconate solutions or leachates.

Conclusions

Plastic packaging greatly reduces the contribution of aluminum to parenteral nutrition solutions from calcium gluconate compared with the glass-packaged product.
