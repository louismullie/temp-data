## Question

Algorithm for endometriosis diagnosis and treatment

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for an algorithm for endometriosis diagnosis and treatment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the overarching principles that should anchor the algorithm. Then, I should verify the diagnostic pathway, including when to suspect, how to image, and when to treat empirically. Next, I will examine treatment choices by patient goals, including pain control, fertility, and adolescent-specific care. After that, I need to check surgical indications, techniques, and postoperative strategies. Finally, I will consider special populations, follow-up, and emerging tools, and I will double-check any points that seem uncertain as I go along.

> Let me first confirm the foundational principles so I don't jump to conclusions: endometriosis is a chronic, estrogen-dependent, inflammatory disease with heterogeneous presentations, so a patient-centered, multimodal, and interdisciplinary approach is essential, and diagnosis should be clinical whenever possible to reduce the historical 5–12 year delay. I should also remember that normal imaging does not exclude disease, especially superficial peritoneal lesions, and that shared decision-making is critical at every step [^c176f0e9] [^682efa72] [^7405fe03] [^f24fa443].

> I will now examine the diagnostic trigger: suspect endometriosis in anyone with dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, deep dyspareunia, dyschezia, dysuria, cyclical bowel or bladder symptoms, fatigue, or infertility. I should double-check that these are the hallmark features endorsed by contemporary guidelines, and yes, ESHRE and the JAMA review align with this symptom constellation, including extrapelvic and cyclical manifestations that can guide localization and severity assessment [^7405fe03] [^c176f0e9].

> Next, I should review the initial evaluation: a careful history mapping pain cyclicity, severity, impact, and associated symptoms, plus a targeted physical exam including bimanual and rectovaginal assessment for uterosacral nodularity, a fixed uterus, or tender nodules. Wait, let me verify the diagnostic yield of exam — ESHRE notes low accuracy, so a normal exam cannot exclude disease, which reinforces the need to integrate symptoms and imaging rather than rely on exam alone [^7938d853] [^f24fa443].

> Now, imaging: I initially thought transvaginal ultrasound was the universal first-line test, but hold on, I should verify guideline nuances. ACR recommends transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound or pelvic MRI as initial imaging in adults with suspected endometriosis, while SOGC emphasizes transvaginal ultrasound to detect endometriomas and deep disease, and ESHRE advises ultrasound or MRI recognizing that negatives do not rule out superficial disease. For deep infiltrating endometriosis or equivocal ultrasound, MRI improves sensitivity and mapping for surgical planning, so I need to tailor modality to pretest probability and local expertise [^0df4505e] [^880633cb] [^f24fa443] [^16028a09].

> Let me consider the role of laparoscopy before I overstate it: historically the "gold standard", but modern guidance supports avoiding diagnostic laparoscopy when imaging and clinical suspicion suffice. I should confirm that ESHRE reserves laparoscopy for cases with negative imaging or failed/inappropriate empiric therapy, and that contemporary reviews advocate a clinical-first approach to reduce delays and morbidity. So, surgery should be therapeutic and goal-directed rather than purely diagnostic in most cases [^14ad53be] [^682efa72] [^c176f0e9].

> For treatment of pain in patients not pursuing immediate pregnancy, I need to ensure first-line therapy is clear: combined hormonal contraceptives or progestin-only options with NSAIDs are appropriate starting points, with evidence of clinically meaningful pain reduction. If first-line fails or is contraindicated, second-line options include GnRH agonists with add-back, GnRH antagonists, or danazol, and third-line options include aromatase inhibitors. I should double-check that guideline endorsements emphasize shared decision-making and side-effect profiles, which they do [^c176f0e9] [^9e337b57] [^189cc810].

> But wait, what if the patient desires pregnancy now or soon? I should confirm that suppressive hormonal therapy does not treat infertility and may delay childbearing, so in this scenario, expectant management, referral to reproductive endocrinology, and consideration of surgery for endometriomas or deep disease are prioritized based on symptoms and patient preference. ESHRE specifically advises guiding surgical excision of deep lesions before ART mainly by pain and preference, and SOGC highlights multidisciplinary care for complex disease, which I should integrate into the plan [^332c9cf9] [^ccdd5a3d] [^c176f0e9].

> For adolescents, I need to check nuances: lesions are often clear or red and easily missed, and acyclic pain is more common, so a high index of suspicion is warranted. NSAIDs are first-line for pain, and if dysmenorrhea persists despite 3–6 months of NSAIDs and hormonal therapy, I should evaluate for secondary causes and consider ultrasound. Conservative surgery with ongoing suppressive therapy is preferred when indicated, and GnRH agonists with add-back can be considered for refractory pain after conservative surgery. I should confirm that ACOG supports these steps, which it does [^3c12756e] [^d8585717] [^089932ba] [^252d3ace].

> Surgical indications deserve careful verification: reserve surgery for refractory pain despite optimized medical therapy, suspected or confirmed deep infiltrating endometriosis, endometriomas ≥ 3 cm or causing symptoms, fertility goals where surgery may improve outcomes, or diagnostic uncertainty after appropriate noninvasive workup. I should confirm that ESHRE and SOGC align with these indications, and they do, including the principle that excision is preferred over ablation when operating [^a84b888c] [^7c5b8cab] [^482f19dc].

> Intraoperatively, I need to ensure technique matches goals: excision provides superior pain relief and lower recurrence than ablation, and for endometriomas, excision rather than drainage or fulguration is preferred. For deep disease involving bowel or bladder, multidisciplinary planning and, when feasible, nerve-sparing techniques are critical. Hold on, I should verify that these points are guideline-supported, and yes, ESHRE and SOGC endorse excision over ablation and emphasize multidisciplinary care for DIE [^482f19dc] [^e0f3fcf8] [^ccdd5a3d].

> Postoperative management should not be overlooked: I should confirm that adjuvant suppressive medical therapy reduces recurrence and prolongs symptom control after conservative surgery, and that patients should be counseled about recurrence risk and contraceptive planning. ACOG and ESHRE support postoperative medical therapy to mitigate recurrence, which I should incorporate into follow-up [^5c0a6ac6] [^aa87362b].

> Special scenarios require tailored decisions: for bowel endometriosis, conservative segmental or shaving approaches are often favored to minimize complications, with surgery individualized to lesion size, location, and symptoms. For endometriomas in patients pursuing fertility, I should balance the risk of surgery on ovarian reserve against the benefits of removing large or persistent cysts, and consider deferring surgery if small, asymptomatic, and not impacting IVF plans. Let me verify that systematic reviews support size thresholds and technique, which they do [^de044c9c] [^454fbeb2].

> Follow-up and longitudinal care must be explicit: endometriosis is chronic and relapsing, so I should schedule periodic reassessment of pain, fertility goals, medication tolerability, and imaging if symptoms recur or change. I need to ensure patients understand that recurrence is common after stopping therapy or after surgery, and that management should evolve with life stage and priorities. Contemporary reviews and guidelines emphasize chronic disease framing and iterative care plans, which I should reinforce [^c176f0e9] [^682efa72].

> Emerging tools and controversies should be acknowledged transparently: biomarkers and AI show promise but are not yet validated for routine diagnosis, though AI models report high sensitivity/specificity in research settings and may aid triage in the future. I should also note that some expert groups advocate for clinical diagnosis to supersede surgical confirmation in many cases, while others still view histology as the definitive standard. I need to communicate these evolving areas honestly to patients [^9b037eed] [^d8c79412] [^682efa72] [^c176f0e9].

> Putting this together, my algorithm is: suspect based on compatible symptoms. Confirm with history, exam, and imaging matched to pretest probability. Avoid diagnostic laparoscopy unless indicated. Treat pain first-line with hormones and NSAIDs, escalate as needed with shared decision-making. Prioritize fertility goals when present. Reserve surgery for refractory symptoms, deep disease, or fertility-related indications. Use excision when operating. Add postoperative suppression. And follow longitudinally with multidisciplinary support. I should double-check that each branch aligns with high-quality guidance, and yes, this synthesis reflects ESHRE, SOGC, ACR, ACOG, and contemporary reviews [^7405fe03] [^880633cb] [^0df4505e] [^c176f0e9].

The endometriosis algorithm centers on **clinical suspicion** from cyclic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, dysmenorrhea, or infertility, and proceeds with **targeted imaging** (transvaginal ultrasound for endometriomas/deep disease; MRI for equivocal cases or complex anatomy) [^f24fa443] [^16028a09]. Definitive diagnosis is **laparoscopy with histology** when imaging is negative or therapy fails, but **empiric medical therapy** is appropriate for strong clinical suspicion without immediate surgery [^14ad53be] [^c176f0e9]. First-line treatment is **hormonal suppression** (combined oral contraceptives or progestins); GnRH agonists/antagonists or danazol are second-line, and surgery is reserved for refractory pain, fertility goals, or suspected malignancy [^c176f0e9] [^a84b888c]. Management should be **individualized**, with shared decision-making and multidisciplinary care for complex disease [^682efa72] [^ccdd5a3d].

---

## Clinical presentation and suspicion

Suspect endometriosis in patients with the following **symptoms and signs**:

- **Pelvic pain**: Cyclic, progressive dysmenorrhea; chronic pelvic pain; deep dyspareunia; dyschezia; dysuria [^7405fe03].
- **Infertility**: Unexplained infertility or subfertility [^c176f0e9].
- **Physical findings**: Uterine tenderness, fixed retroverted uterus, adnexal masses, uterosacral nodularity, or tenderness [^d4ada7f7].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Step 1: clinical assessment

Obtain a **detailed history** (pain characteristics, menstrual history, fertility goals, family history) and perform a **focused physical examination** (pelvic and rectovaginal) to identify deep nodules or endometriomas [^23fdb733] [^7938d853].

---

### Step 2: imaging

- **Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS)**: First-line to detect endometriomas and deep infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) [^880633cb] [^ebc47c4c].
- **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**: Use when TVUS is inconclusive or DIE is suspected; superior for mapping complex lesions [^16028a09] [^b629489b].
- **Limitations**: Imaging cannot reliably detect superficial peritoneal disease; negative imaging does not exclude endometriosis [^f24fa443] [^c176f0e9].

---

### Step 3: definitive diagnosis

Laparoscopy with histopathology remains the **gold standard** for definitive diagnosis, particularly when imaging is negative or empiric therapy fails [^14ad53be] [^c176f0e9].

---

## Treatment algorithm

Treatment is **individualized** based on symptoms, fertility goals, age, and disease severity [^682efa72].

---

### Medical management (first-line)

- **Combined hormonal contraceptives**: First-line for pain suppression; continuous or cyclic regimens [^c176f0e9].
- **Progestin-only therapy**: Oral progestins, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate, or levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS) [^c176f0e9].
- **NSAIDs**: Adjunctive therapy for pain relief [^c0da8eac].

---

### Second-line medical therapy

- **GnRH agonists/antagonists**: For refractory pain; use with add-back therapy to mitigate bone loss [^189cc810] [^7d790774].
- **Danazol**: Alternative for refractory cases; androgenic side effects limit use [^c176f0e9].

---

### Surgical management

- **Indications**: Refractory pain despite medical therapy, fertility goals, suspected malignancy, or large/endometriomas [^a84b888c] [^b220c527].
- **Approach**: Laparoscopic excision or ablation; excision preferred for endometriomas and deep disease [^482f19dc] [^e0f3fcf8].
- **Adjunctive therapy**: Postoperative hormonal suppression to reduce recurrence [^5c0a6ac6].

---

## Special considerations

- **Adolescents**: Empiric medical therapy is appropriate; laparoscopy reserved for refractory cases or diagnostic uncertainty [^d8585717] [^4b373637].
- **Infertility**: Individualized approach; consider surgery or assisted reproductive technology (ART) based on disease severity and patient preference [^332c9cf9] [^682efa72].
- **Deep endometriosis**: Multidisciplinary care and expert surgical centers are recommended [^ccdd5a3d] [^274e1b61].

---

## Follow-up and monitoring

Regular follow-up is essential to assess **symptom control**, **treatment response**, and **recurrence**. Management should be adjusted based on patient feedback, side effects, and changing fertility goals [^682efa72].

---

## Emerging therapies and research

Research is ongoing into **noninvasive biomarkers**, **AI-assisted diagnostics**, and **novel medical therapies** to improve early detection and personalize treatment [^9b037eed] [^d8c79412] [^17fc9393].

---

The endometriosis algorithm emphasizes **early clinical recognition**, **targeted imaging**, and **individualized therapy**, with surgery reserved for refractory cases or fertility goals. This approach aims to reduce diagnostic delay, improve symptom control, and enhance quality of life [^682efa72].

### Clinical diagnosis of endometriosis: a call to action [^e5f276f3]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis can have a profound impact on women's lives, including associated pain, infertility, decreased quality of life, and interference with daily life, relationships, and livelihood. The first step in alleviating these adverse sequelae is to diagnose the underlying condition. For many women, the journey to endometriosis diagnosis is long and fraught with barriers and misdiagnoses. Inherent challenges include a gold standard based on an invasive surgical procedure (laparoscopy) and diverse symptomatology, contributing to the well-established delay of 4–11 years from first symptom onset to surgical diagnosis. We believe that remedying the diagnostic delay requires increased patient education and timely referral to a women's healthcare provider and a shift in physician approach to the disorder. Endometriosis should be approached as a chronic, systemic, inflammatory, and heterogeneous disease that presents with symptoms of pelvic pain and/or infertility, rather than focusing primarily on surgical findings and pelvic lesions. Using this approach, symptoms, signs, and clinical findings of endometriosis are anticipated to become the main drivers of clinical diagnosis and earlier intervention. Combining these factors into a practical algorithm is expected to simplify endometriosis diagnosis and make the process accessible to more clinicians and patients, culminating in earlier effective management. The time has come to bridge disparities and to minimize delays in endometriosis diagnosis and treatment for the benefit of women worldwide.

### Pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of endometriosis [^d9d883b7]. BMJ (2022). Excellent credibility.

Endometriosis affects approximately 190 million women and people assigned female at birth worldwide. It is a chronic, inflammatory, gynecologic disease marked by the presence of endometrial-like tissue outside the uterus, which in many patients is associated with debilitating painful symptoms. Patients with endometriosis are also at greater risk of infertility, emergence of fatigue, multisite pain, and other comorbidities. Thus, endometriosis is best understood as a condition with variable presentation and effects at multiple life stages. A long diagnostic delay after symptom onset is common, and persistence and recurrence of symptoms despite treatment is common. This review discusses the potential genetic, hormonal, and immunologic factors that lead to endometriosis, with a focus on current diagnostic and management strategies for gynecologists, general practitioners, and clinicians specializing in conditions for which patients with endometriosis are at higher risk. It examines evidence supporting the different surgical, pharmacologic, and non-pharmacologic approaches to treating patients with endometriosis and presents an easy to adopt step-by-step management strategy. As endometriosis is a multisystem disease, patients with the condition should ideally be offered a personalized, multimodal, interdisciplinary treatment approach. A priority for future discovery is determining clinically informative sub-classifications of endometriosis that predict prognosis and enhance treatment prioritization.

### Challenges to our understanding of endometriosis pain [^71a80127]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2006). Low credibility.

Endometriosis remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge despite decades of clinical experience and research. The multiple treatment options for endometriosis described in this symposium clearly indicate how difficult it can be to diagnose and effectively treat endometriosis with our current understanding of the disease. At least 3 major challenges to our understanding can be identified: (1) endometriosis does not always cause pain; (2) other causes of pelvic pain often coexists in patients with endometriosis; and (3) common medical and surgical treatments for endometriosis are relatively nonspecific. Insights from the articles in this symposium can help clinicians reach a new level of understanding of endometriosis and perhaps lead to more effective methods for diagnosing and treating this perplexing condition.

### Role of a symptom-based algorithmic approach to chronic pelvic pain [^6b0d3497]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a disorder that has a significant impact on the patient's quality of life. Laparoscopic diagnosis can be disappointing, and recurrence is common after surgical treatment. A symptom-based algorithmic approach to treatment of CPP is presented that is safe and cost-effective.

Methods

This approach is oriented towards making a potential clinical diagnosis of endometriosis. It relies on a structured evaluation of the patient and administration of medical therapy including GnRH agonists to selected patients. Evaluation begins with a history and physical examination; selected cases receive specific therapy. Non-responders undergo appropriate laboratory and imaging studies. If results remain negative, it is possible to make a clinical diagnosis of endometriosis and begin empiric treatment.

Results

Early results strongly indicate that using this approach allowed clinicians to make highly accurate diagnoses (correct in 85–90% of cases).

Conclusion

Use of this approach will minimize the need for surgery.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® endometriosis [^87c0f61e]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is a common condition impacting individuals assigned female at birth. Though incompletely understood, the disorder is caused by endometrial-like tissue located outside of the endometrial cavity, associated with inflammation and fibrosis. Clinical presentation is variable, ranging from asymptomatic to severe pelvic pain and infertility. Treatment is determined by the patient's individualized goals and can include medical therapies to temporize symptoms or definitive surgical excision. Imaging is used to help diagnose endometriosis and for treatment planning. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Should a diagnosis of endometriosis be sought in all symptomatic women? [^baacf013]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

A tool is needed to enable clinicians to determine whether women wish to seek a pathology-based explanation for chronic pelvic pain or whether they just want symptom relief. Such an approach might reduce the number of unnecessary laparoscopies without adversely affecting outcomes.

### The endometrioma treatment paradigm when fertility is desired: a systematic review [^454fbeb2]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

To establish an endometrioma treatment paradigm (decision tree) in the treatment of an ovarian endometrioma through the review of current literature.

Data Sources

A thorough literature search, including PubMed, Google Scholar, and the Cochrane Library, was performed from April 2020 to July 2020. The review was completed by using the following keywords: METHODS OF STUDY SELECTION: Articles published in English that addressed the endometrioma in regard to the following were included: (1) diagnosis, (2) treatment of pain on the basis of size and/or surgical intervention, (3) treatment of fertility on the basis of size and/or surgical intervention, (4) surgical technique, (5) in vitro fertilization success on the basis of size and/or surgical intervention, (6) risk of rupture at the time of egg retrieval, (7) impact on the antimüllerian hormone and antral follicle count postsurgery, and (8) impact on implantation.

Tabulation, Integration, and Results

Fifty-six articles were included in this systematic review. While conducting this literature review, several themes were noted. In general, the literature on the ovarian endometrioma seems to be homogeneous in regard to imaging the endometrioma, excision rather than desiccation for an endometrioma ≥ 3-cm causing pain and/or infertility, minimal use of bipolar energy at the time of ovarian surgery, and risk of severe infection secondary to inadvertent rupture of cysts during egg retrieval. Conversely, studies on the ovarian endometrioma are much more heterogeneous in terms of surgery and assisted reproductive technology, that is, whether surgery should be performed. Certainly, an endometrioma ≥ 5-cm should be excised before assisted reproductive technology. Moreover, it seems that the antral follicle count and implantation may be enhanced with surgery.

Conclusion

By completing an extensive literature review, an easy-to-use algorithm for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of endometriomas was developed to help clinicians in their treatment of patients with endometriosis in the short and long terms.

### Consensus statement for the management of chronic pelvic pain and endometriosis: proceedings of an expert-panel consensus process [^2a45ddfd]. Fertility and Sterility (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To develop recommendations for the medical and surgical care of women who present with chronic pelvic pain (CPP) and are likely to have endometriosis as the underlying cause.

Design

An expert panel comprised of practicing gynecologists from throughout the United States and experts in consensus guideline development was convened. After completion of a structured literature search and creation of draft algorithms by an executive committee, the expert panel of > 50 practicing gynecologists met for a 2-day consensus conference during which the clinical recommendations and algorithms were reviewed, refined, and then ratified by unanimous or near-unanimous votes.

Patient(S)

Women presenting with CPP who are likely to have endometriosis as the underlying cause.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

None.

Conclusion(S)

Chronic pelvic pain frequently occurs secondary to nongynecologic conditions that must be considered in the evaluation of affected women. For women in whom endometriosis is the suspected cause of the pain, laparoscopic confirmation of the diagnosis is unnecessary, and a trial of medical therapy, including second-line therapies such as danazol, GnRH agonists, and progestins, is justified provided that there are no other indications for surgery such as the presence of a suspicious adnexal mass. When surgery is necessary, laparoscopic approaches seem to offer comparable clinical outcomes to those performed via laparotomy, but with reduced morbidity. The balance of evidence supports the use of adjuvant postoperative medical therapy after conservative surgery for CPP. There is some evidence that adjuvant presacral neurectomy adds benefit for midline pain, but currently, there is inadequate evidence to support the use of uterosacral nerve ablation or uterine suspension. Hysterectomy alone has undocumented value in the surgical management of women with endometriosis-associated CPP.

### Clues to revising the conventional diagnostic algorithm for endometriosis [^085d75ae]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is a complex gynecologic disorder characterized primarily by symptoms of pelvic pain, infertility, and altered quality of life. National and international guidelines highlight the diagnostic difficulties and lack of conclusive diagnostic tools for endometriosis. Furthermore, guidelines are becoming questionable at an increasingly rapid rate as new diagnostic techniques emerge. This work aims to provide a knowledge synthesis of the relevance of various diagnostic tools and to assess areas of improvement of conventional algorithms. MEDLINE and Cochrane Library databases were searched from January 2021 to December 2023 using relevant key words. Articles evaluating the diagnostic relevance and performance of various tools were included and independently reviewed by the authors for eligibility. Included studies were assessed using the GRADE and QUADAS-2 tools. Of the 4204 retrieved articles, 26 were included. While anamnesis and clinical examination do contribute to diagnostic accuracy, their level of evidence and impact on the diagnostic process remains limited. Although imaging techniques are recommended to investigate endometriosis, ultrasonography remains highly operator dependent. Magnetic resonance imaging appears to exhibit higher sensitivities than ultrasound. However, concerns persist with regards to the terminology, anatomical definition of lesions, and accuracies of both ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Recently, several biological markers have been studied and cumulative evidence supports the contribution of noncoding RNAs to the diagnosis of endometriosis. Marginal improvements have been suggested for anamnesis, clinical examination, and imaging examinations. Conversely, some biomarkers, including the saliva microRNA signature for endometriosis, have emerged as diagnostic tools which inspire reflection on the revision of conventional diagnostic algorithms.

### Diagnosis of endometriosis and pelvic pain [^db2f0556]. Fertility and Sterility (2006). Low credibility.

Both the American and the Royal Colleges of Obstetricians and Gynecologists have produced guidelines that recommend patients with chronic pelvic pain, including those suspected of having endometriosis, should receive empirical medical therapy without a preliminary diagnostic laparoscopy. This paper reviews the implications of this approach.

### Current strategies for endometriosis management [^52a2831e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is a common gynecologic disorder that persists throughout the reproductive years. Although endometriosis is a surgical diagnosis, medical management with ovarian suppression remains the mainstay of long-term management with superimposed surgical intervention when needed. The goal of surgery should be excision or ablation of all visible disease to minimize risk of recurrence and need for repeat surgeries. When infertility is the presenting symptom, surgical therapy in addition to assisted reproductive technology can improve chances of conception; however, the treatment approach depends on stage of disease and other patient characteristics that affect fecundity.

### Surgery for endometriosis: beyond medical therapies [^aa87362b]. Fertility and Sterility (2017). Low credibility.

Endometriosis-associated pelvic pain and subfertility may be managed medically in many cases; however, the surgical management of this insidious disease remains a necessary part of the treatment algorithm. Laparoscopy for diagnosis alone is rarely indicated with the advancements in preoperative imaging. When surgery is performed, the ideal goal would be a therapeutic and effective surgical intervention based on the preoperative evaluation. Surgery for women with pain due to endometriosis may be indicated in patients who cannot or do not wish to take medical therapies; acute surgical or pain events; deep endometriosis; during concomitant management of other gynecologic disorders; and patients seeking fertility with pain. The role of surgery for endometriosis-related subfertility may be considered in those with hydrosalpinges undergoing IVF; management of ovarian endometriomas in specific circumstances; and when a patient requests surgery as an alternative to assisted reproductive technology (ART). Surgery for ovarian endometriomas requires special attention due to the risk of potential harm on future fertility. Finally, a combined approach of surgery followed by postoperative medical therapy offers the best long-term outcomes for recurrence of disease and symptoms. A patient-centered approach and a goal-oriented approach are essential when determining the options for care in this population.

### Clinical use of artificial intelligence in endometriosis: a scoping review [^93bdd910]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Of the 36 studies included in this review, 50% were published in the last 5 years, indicating that there is recent and rapidly growing interest in AI applications to improve diagnostic, predictive and research capabilities for a complex disease such as endometriosis. Further research should be conducted using human comparators and should include comparisons with existing scoring systems and diagnostic tools to determine AI's superiority for predictive and diagnostic modeling in endometriosis. These AI algorithms should also be externally validated or tested through prospective controlled trials to ensure that they contribute to advancing real-world clinical practice and diagnostics. This review was able to identify this interest in AI and highlight the benefits and shortcomings of AI interventions to improve future models for endometriosis.

### Nonsurgical approaches to the diagnosis and evaluation of endometriosis [^8aeff510]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

An inability to make the diagnosis of endometriosis or evaluate lesion response to treatment without surgery is a clear impediment to understanding the disease and to developing new therapies. The need is particularly strong for rASRM Stage 1 or 2 disease, since higher stage (rASRM Stage 3 or 4) endometriosis can often be diagnosed by ultrasound or other imaging techniques. Despite promising findings in association studies, no biomarkers or nonsurgical diagnostic or evaluation methods for Stage 1 or Stage 2 endometriosis has yet been clinically validated. Admittedly, validation is difficult, since surgery is required as a gold standard diagnostic method for comparison. This manuscript is aimed as a succinct review of what is known about nonsurgical approaches to detect and assess endometriosis, with an emphasis on Stage 1 and 2.

### Improving the diagnosis of endometriosis in Asia-Pacific: consensus from the Asia-Pacific endometriosis expert panel for endometriosis [^5af66d8c]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis should be diagnosed as early as possible in the continuum of care; but substantial delays of approximately 6-8years between symptom onset and endometriosis diagnosis have been widely reported. With the purpose of improving the prompt diagnosis of endometriosis, the Asia-Pacific Endometriosis Expert Panel (APEX) sought to address the reasons for diagnostic delays across the region, and formulate a multi-pronged approach to overcoming these challenges. In the first instance, clinical diagnosis is preferable to surgical diagnosis, in order to facilitate earlier empirical treatment and minimize the negative sequelae of undiagnosed/untreated disease. There should be a high clinical index of suspicion in women presenting with cyclical symptoms, including those involving extrapelvic organs. Diagnostic delays in Asia-Pacific countries are attributable to a variety of patient, physician, and healthcare factors, including poor awareness, normalization/trivialization of pain, individual/cultural attitudes toward menstruation, default use of symptom-suppressing treatments, misdiagnosis, and a lack of diagnostic resourcing or adequate referral pathways in some areas. Suggested initiatives to reduce diagnostic delays are geared toward improving public awareness, improving clinical diagnostic skills, streamlining multidisciplinary care pathways for timely referral, updating and implementing diagnostic guidelines, lobbying policymakers and insurance companies for endometriosis support, and increasing efforts to bridge data gaps and perform further research in this field. Formulating specific action plans and gathering traction are the responsibility of individual countries within local parameters. The APEX group advocates for any initiatives and policies that support the unmet needs of women with endometriosis, to improve patient experience and outcomes.

Patient Selection

Diagnosis

Historically, a definitive diagnosis of endometriosis required laparoscopic lesion visualization and excision with histologic confirmation of endometrial gland, endometrial stroma, and/or hemosiderin-laden macrophage presence. However, even in the absence of a definitive diagnosis, many professional society treatment recommendations permit the use of empiric therapy when there is a strong suspicion or clinical evidence of endometriosis. For example, guidelines from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) give a Level B recommendation to empiric therapy with a 3-month course of a GnRH agonist in women with chronic pelvic pain who have undergone an appropriate pretreatment evaluation and in whom oral contraceptives and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have failed, noting the patient should be informed that treatment response does not confirm an endometriosis diagnosis.

The criteria for suspecting endometriosis differ among guidelines, but generally include the presence of pelvic pain symptoms (progressively worsening dysmenorrhea [particularly when severe and unresponsive to NSAIDs and/or hormonal-based therapies], NMPP, and deep dyspareunia), which may be augmented by physical findings (e.g. pelvic tenderness and nodularity on palpation of the uterosacral ligaments and rectovaginal septum), imaging results, and/or cyclical nongynecologic symptoms (dyschezia, dysuria, hematuria and rectal bleeding, diarrhea/irritable bowel syndrome, and shoulder pain). When symptoms are cyclic in nature and progressive over time, endometriosis is by far the most likely clinical diagnosis.

It is increasingly recognized that identification of endometriosis can be achieved with reasonable certainty using nonsurgical methodologies (i.e. a clinical diagnosis), which include evaluation of pelvic pain symptoms, patient history, physical examination findings, and appropriately performed imaging studies. Although there has yet to be identified a replacement test or tests for diagnostic surgery, clinicians with expertise in endometriosis diagnosis and management have suggested that symptoms, patient history, and clinical assessments taken in totality provide a basis for clinical diagnosis.

The benefits of undertaking a clinical diagnosis approach are that it does not require surgery and the attendant risks thereof, utilizes assessment tools that are readily available to most clinicians, and may reduce the delay frequently observed in endometriosis diagnosis. In clinical practice, presumptive diagnosis of endometriosis is often made without laparoscopy or other surgical procedure, and can facilitate early and effective management of patients' symptoms.

### A practical guide to the clinical evaluation of endometriosis-associated pelvic pain [^931f1ec5]. Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis-associated pain (EAP) has a significant impact on the quality of life of those affected and their families. Recognizing that endometriosis is a chronic condition associated with an impairment in function and negative social impact, there is a shift toward reducing diagnostic delays and initiating timely management. This article provides a comprehensive and practical approach to the clinical diagnosis of EAP, which can subsequently facilitate prompt and directed treatment. The key components of the history, physical examination, and high-quality imaging to evaluate suspected EAP and related pain conditions are presented. Currently, biomarkers have limited utility in the diagnosis of endometriosis, but research in this area continues; development of a reliable noninvasive test for endometriosis may further improve early identification of this condition.

### Clinical use of artificial intelligence in endometriosis: a scoping review [^d8c79412]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is a chronic, debilitating, gynecologic condition with a non-specific clinical presentation. Globally, patients can experience diagnostic delays of ~6 to 12 years, which significantly hinders adequate management and places a significant financial burden on patients and the healthcare system. Through artificial intelligence (AI), it is possible to create models that can extract data patterns to act as inputs for developing interventions with predictive and diagnostic accuracies that are superior to conventional methods and current tools used in standards of care. This literature review explored the use of AI methods to address different clinical problems in endometriosis. Approximately 1309 unique records were found across four databases; among those, 36 studies met the inclusion criteria. Studies were eligible if they involved an AI approach or model to explore endometriosis pathology, diagnostics, prediction, or management and if they reported evaluation metrics (sensitivity and specificity) after validating their models. Only articles accessible in English were included in this review. Logistic regression was the most popular machine learning method, followed by decision tree algorithms, random forest, and support vector machines. Approximately 44.4% (n = 16) of the studies analyzed the predictive capabilities of AI approaches in patients with endometriosis, while 47.2% (n = 17) explored diagnostic capabilities, and 8.33% (n = 3) used AI to improve disease understanding. Models were built using different data types, including biomarkers, clinical variables, metabolite spectra, genetic variables, imaging data, mixed methods, and lesion characteristics. Regardless of the AI-based endometriosis application (either diagnostic or predictive), pooled sensitivities ranged from 81.7 to 96.7%, and pooled specificities ranged between 70.7 and 91.6%. Overall, AI models displayed good diagnostic and predictive capacity in detecting endometriosis using simple classification scenarios (i.e. differentiating between cases and controls), showing promising directions for AI in assessing endometriosis in the near future. This timely review highlighted an emerging area of interest in endometriosis and AI. It also provided recommendations for future research in this field to improve the reproducibility of results and comparability between models, and further test the capacity of these models to enhance diagnosis, prediction, and management in endometriosis patients.

### An evidence-based approach to assessing surgical versus clinical diagnosis of symptomatic endometriosis [^2a36b40c]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2018). Low credibility.

Challenges intrinsic to the accurate diagnosis of endometriosis contribute to an extended delay between the onset of symptoms and clinical confirmation. Intraoperative visualization, preferably with histologic verification, is considered by many professional organizations to be the gold standard by which endometriosis is diagnosed. Clinical diagnosis of symptomatic endometriosis via patient history, physical examination, and noninvasive tests, though more easily executed, is generally viewed as less accurate than surgical diagnosis. Technological advances and increased understanding of the pathophysiology of endometriosis warrant continuing reevaluation of the standard method for diagnosing symptomatic disease. A review of the published literature was therefore performed with the goal of comparing the accuracy of clinical diagnostic measures with that of surgical diagnosis. The current body of evidence suggests that clinical diagnosis of symptomatic endometriosis is more reliable than previously recognized and that surgical diagnosis has limitations that could be underappreciated. Regardless of the methodology used, women with suspected symptomatic endometriosis would be well served by a diagnostic paradigm that is reliable, conveys minimal risk of under- or over-diagnosis, lessens the time from symptom development to diagnosis, and guides the appropriate use of medical and surgical management strategies.

### Time for global health policy and research leaders to prioritize endometriosis [^17fc9393]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Heterogeneous presentation of endometriosis impedes diagnosis and treatment

Most pelvic endometriosis comprises three subtypes: superficial peritoneal, ovarian cysts ("endometrioma"), and deep disease. Symptom manifestation and severity vary, and underdiagnosis is common due to erroneous symptom normalization and overlap with other diseases. Recently, refined imaging techniques identify, with high accuracy, ovarian and deep disease, but reliance on surgical visualisation for the most common superficial peritoneal lesions continues to impede timely diagnosis. Surgery or imaging requires access to healthcare services, which varies significantly across socio-economic and racial/ethnically underserved groups and geographies. Average diagnostic delay is 7 years after symptom onset, with delays > 10 years not uncommon. There remains no reliable non-invasive biomarker of any endometriosis subtype.

Treatment of pain symptoms falls broadly into surgical removal of disease and associated adhesions and hormonal suppressive therapies, including combined oral contraceptive steroids, progestins, gonadotropin releasing hormone analogues, androgens and aromatase inhibitors. Medical therapies that decrease oestrogen (or counter oestrogen action) are prescribed, because steroids play a key role in the pathophysiology of endometriosis. Unfortunately, both approaches are suboptimal. Surgery is associated with recurrence rates up to 50% within 5 years, and contraceptive hormone treatments often have unacceptable side effects and are counterproductive to fertility goals. Geographic and financial barriers to accessing treatment from endometriosis-trained healthcare providers are common. Surveys of patients consistently highlight symptom relief and improved medical therapies that do not limit fertility as a top priority for research. Historically, pharmaceutical companies were reluctant to develop new drugs for endometriosis, and focus has been on variations of hormonal, anti-inflammatory, or repurposed therapies, lacking revolutionary impact. While novel treatment discovery is essential, clinical trials for endometriosis have been plagued by widespread variations in outcome reporting, and only a fraction of completed trials is published.

Emerging chronic pelvic pain-focused therapies that include considerations of neuropathic and nociceptive pathways have not been adequately studied. Those with persistent/recurrent pain have a high rate of hysterectomywhich does not eliminate pain recurrence and may heighten risks for multiple conditions later in life. Further, commonly reported life-impacting concerns including fatigue and impaired sexual functioning have yet to be targeted for treatment among patients with endometriosis. A critical impediment to discovery of novel diagnostics and treatments and personalized approaches is the lack of a prognostically correlated classification of the highly heterogenous presentation of endometriosis lesion types and symptoms, which includes variation and evolution within patients across the life-course.

### Changing the "scope" of diagnosing endometriosis: the new frontier of noninvasive markers [^9b037eed]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis affects 1 in 9 women, and diagnosis is often delayed using conventional laparoscopy. Noninvasive markers of endometriosis have the potential to enable earlier diagnosis, leading to more timely treatment and better surgical planning. This issue's Views and Reviews seek to summarize the current status of noninvasive markers of endometriosis. Experts in reproductive medicine with prior work in this field summarize the key literature on endometrial biomarkers, blood biomarkers, and advanced imaging, including ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. At present, there is no single definitive biomarker that can diagnose endometriosis with high sensitivity and specificity. Advancing endometriosis biomarkers beyond the discovery phase is challenging, and more work is needed. Clinicians who have an improved understanding of noninvasive imaging and biomarkers will be able to identify endometriosis earlier and more easily, allowing for prompt consideration of treatment options. We believe that continued research, innovation, and development will lead to improved diagnostic accuracy and guidance toward the best treatments for endometriosis-related pain and infertility.

### ACOG updates guideline on diagnosis and treatment of… [^466882dc]. AAFP (2011). Low credibility.

Definitive diagnosis of endometriosis can be made only by histology of lesions that have been removed surgically. Imaging studies cannot be used to diagnose endometriosis, but they can be useful in patients with pelvic or adnexal masses. Ovarian endometriomas typically appear on ultrasonography as cysts that contain low-level homogeneous internal echoes consistent with old blood. Imaging alone seems to be highly predictive in differentiating ovarian endometriomas from other adnexal masses. Transvaginal ultrasonography is the preferred imaging modality to determine the presence of endometriosis and deeply infiltrating endometriosis of the rectum or recto-vaginal septum. Magnetic resonance imaging should be reserved for patients with equivocal ultrasound results and in whom rectovaginal or bladder endometriosis is suspected.

Treatment INITIAL TREATMENT Progestins, danazol, extended-cycle combined oral contraceptives, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists can be used for initial treatment of pain in women with suspected endometriosis. However, recurrence rates are high after the medication is discontinued. If initial therapy is unsuccessful, diagnostic laparoscopy can be offered to confirm the diagnosis. Alternatively, empiric treatment with another suppressive medication is an option. Empiric therapy with a three-month course of a GnRH agonist is appropriate if initial treatment with oral contraceptives and NSAIDs is unsuccessful. It is important to explain to the patient that response to empiric therapy does not confirm the diagnosis of endometriosis.

There is also concern about the possibility of estrogen-induced malignant transformation in residual endometriosis; this has led some physicians to routinely recommend the addition of a progestin to the estrogen therapy. However, there is no evidence to support this recommendation. TREATMENT OF INFERTILITY ASSOCIATED WITH ENDOMETRIOSIS Medical suppressive therapy, such as oral contraceptives or GnRH agonists, is ineffective for treatment of infertility associated with endometriosis. Surgery improves pregnancy rates, but the magnitude of improvement is not clear. Excision of deeply infiltrating endometriomas may adversely affect fertility. After initial unsuccessful surgery for infertility associated with endometriosis, in vitro fertilization is preferred over repeat surgery unless pain is still present. Repeat ovarian surgery has a significant negative effect on in vitro fertilization outcomes.

### Real world perspectives on endometriosis disease phenotyping through surgery, omics, health data, and artificial intelligence [^27beac43]. Npj Women's Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

In the "real world", we, as a research and clinical community, have come a long way, together, to mine the mysteries of endometriosis. It is anticipated that multidisciplinary and integrative approaches will reveal features of endometriosis and its various subtypes that will transform non-invasive biomarker development to diagnose disease, identify cell-specific targets for personalized single or combined medical therapies for endometriosis pain and sub/infertility, and develop risk prediction models for disease and symptom recurrence. Additionally, as technology advances, we predict that surgical management, as well as medical management of endometriosis, will become standardized and democratized within the next 2–3 decades. Furthermore, incorporating AI and computational approaches is viewed as vital in analyzing multiomics and clinical datasets and patterns and improving understanding of endometriosis. Training the next generation of surgeons, clinicians, computational, epidemiologic, and wet lab researchers is a major goal to assure a pipeline of collaborators whose focus and efforts will result in improved well-being of patients affected by endometriosis and the ultimate goals of prevention and cure of this enigmatic disease.

### Endometriosis: evaluation and treatment [^c0da8eac]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is an inflammatory condition caused by the presence of endometrial tissue in extra-uterine locations and can involve bowel, bladder, and all peritoneal structures. It is one of the most common gynecologic disorders, affecting up to 10% of people of reproductive age. Presentation of endometriosis can vary widely, from infertility in asymptomatic people to debilitating pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and period-related gastrointestinal or urinary symptoms. Diagnosis of endometriosis in the primary care setting is clinical and often challenging, frequently resulting in delayed diagnosis and treatment. Although transvaginal ultrasonography is used to evaluate endometriosis of deep pelvic sites to rule out other causes of pelvic pain, magnetic resonance imaging is preferred if deep infiltrating endometriosis is suspected. Laparoscopy with biopsy remains the definitive method for diagnosis, although several gynecologic organizations recommend empiric therapy without immediate surgical diagnosis. Combined hormonal contraceptives with or without nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are first-line options in managing symptoms and have a tolerable adverse effect profile. Second-line treatments include gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor agonists with add-back therapy, GnRH receptor antagonists, and danazol. Aromatase inhibitors are reserved for severe disease. All of these treatments are effective but may cause additional adverse effects. Referral to gynecology for surgical management is indicated if empiric therapy is ineffective, immediate diagnosis and treatment are necessary, or patients desire pregnancy. Alternative treatments have limited benefit in alleviating pain symptoms but may warrant further investigation.

### Evaluation and management of women with endometriosis [^5c66b1b8]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is a condition that often leads to a variety of symptoms that range from pain complaints to infertility. Endometriosis is also found in women who are asymptomatic. The diagnosis of endometriosis can be made clinically with reliability similar to that of one made surgically. Medical treatment options are effective, as are surgical treatment options. Complications associated with surgery, however, push the balance in favor of medical therapy whenever possible. Based on the body of evidence available at present, women with endometriosis-related complaints should be treated with a first-line medical therapy. If that fails, a second-line medical therapy is warranted under most conditions. Laparoscopic surgery should be reserved for patients in whom second-line medical therapy has failed or is contraindicated by desire to conceive immediately or as soon as possible.

If a patient does not experience clinical improvement for her dysmenorrhea within 3–6 months of therapy initiation, the obstetrician–gynecologist should investigate for possible secondary causes and for treatment adherence, and during evaluation for secondary dysmenorrhea pelvic imaging with ultrasonography, regardless of findings on pelvic examination, also should be considered.

### Continued improvement to imaging diagnosis and treatment triage of endometriosis: the role of the multi-disciplinary conference [^9aa360f7]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Patient-centered endometriosis management tailored to the individual patient's subset of symptoms often requires highly sensitive and specific preoperative imaging. In the setting of a present ongoing learning curve among radiologists who interpret pelvis ultrasounds and MRIs for diagnosis of endometriosis, we have found that routine feedback between minimally invasive gynecology surgeons and radiologists, based on pre-operative imaging and postoperative laparoscopic findings, is essential for the continual improvement of imaging-based staging of endometriosis and empower pre-operative imaging as an important pillar of endometriosis management. We share illustrative patient cases, which, after collaborative discussion during our routine multi-institutional, multi-disciplinary conferences (MDCs) have led to improved patient counseling, better pre-surgical planning, and therefore improved patient satisfaction. Our endometriosis MDCs will continue to improve patient management in the future by providing a forum for trainees in medical, surgical, imaging, and pathology specialties to gain expertise directly from subspecialists, and participate in the care of these patients.

The most common location of extragenital endometriosis is the bowel. Medical treatment may not provide long-term improvement in patients who are symptomatic, and consequently most of these patients may require surgical intervention. Over the past century, surgeons have continued to debate the optimal surgical approach to treating bowel endometriosis, weighing the risks against the benefits. In this expert review we will describe how the recommended surgical approach depends largely on the location of disease, in addition to size and depth of the lesion. For lesions approximately 5–8 cm from the anal verge, we encourage conservative surgical management over resection to decrease the risk of short- and long-term complications.

### A treatment algorithm for high-tone pelvic floor dysfunction [^907f8aab]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain is estimated to affect one-quarter of women, costing more than $5.8 billion annually. High-tone pelvic floor disorder (HTPFD), characterized by tight, weakened, and/or painful pelvic floor muscles, is present in 60–90% of women with chronic pelvic pain. Muscle tension interferes with dynamic physiologic action, preventing appropriate pelvic floor coordination, contraction, and relaxation. High-tone pelvic floor dysfunction alone can cause pain and a wide range of genitourinary complaints, but can co-exist with other pelvic pain disorders. It frequently goes both unrecognized and untreated, contributing to poor outcomes.

High-tone pelvic floor dysfunction can be idiopathic or incited by poor toileting habits, visceral dysfunction (eg, endometriosis or interstitial cystitis or bladder pain syndrome), or musculoskeletal injuries (eg, sacroiliac joint dysfunction or hip osteoarthritis). Clinical identification of increased pelvic floor tone is subjective, relying on practitioner vaginal examination to identify hypertonicity pelvic floor muscles.

Beyond the diagnosis, there is little guidance on treatment pathways. While multiple studies have examined potential treatments for HTPFD, there is considerable variability in peer-reviewed evidence quality. Head-to-head studies of therapeutic approaches are lacking, making it challenging for many clinicians to determine treatment progression. Insufficient clinical guidance often leaves patients unable to access effective treatment or make informed decisions.

In the absence of guidelines or level I evidence, we sought to generate a treatment algorithm using the Delphi method, a formal, systematic qualitative methodology, to compile expert opinion statements supported by available literature pertinent to HTPFD.

### Clinical use of artificial intelligence in endometriosis: a scoping review [^8b69e8b7]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Our scoping review was able to evaluate the current literature and map out the field of study to demonstrate that AI applications in endometriosis look promising for improving diagnostics, research efficacy and outcome prediction in this patient population. Pooled SE ranged between 81.7 and 96.7% and pooled SP ranged between 70.7 and 91.6%. Our review included a range of heterogenous study designs, large retrospective analyses, various ML interventions and diverse research questions in the field of endometriosis. This is a timely review providing clinicians and computer scientists with an extensive understanding of AI applications in endometriosis. Clinical decision-making by humans is often prone to errors, biases and heuristics. However, this review shows strong promise for AI's ability to mitigate these human errors and provide superior outcome prediction with high SE and SP. Although many of the studies included in this review relied on a human component for data analysis/collection and determining feature extraction, AI technologies (especially when using standardized and validated models) may present the potential to reduce diagnostic error that can result from individual practicing biases and clinical heuristics. Future studies with human comparators are required to determine this. This review also demonstrated how AI can be used to improve research efficacy particularly through the use of natural language processingand identification of potential biomarkersand diseasesassociated with endometriosis pathophysiology. Lastly, this scoping review adds to future recommendations for research in this field and supports the need for standardized guidelines for ML applications in medicine.

### Focus for the future: tackling the 'pelvic pain' problem in gynecologic practice-an interactive session [^f0e3af21]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

The clinical management of women with chronic pelvic pain (CPP) and endometriosis involves important issues that exist at the interface between these two conditions.

Methods

To address these issues, an interactive session was convened to discuss an empiric algorithmic protocol for the clinical management of CPP and endometriosis presented during the Takeda-sponsored session as part of the XVI FIGO World Congress of Gynecology and Obstetrics and to monitor the audience response to this approach.

Results

Approximately one-third of the audience responded that they would definitely try this method, approximately 18% were already using it, and approximately 21% would be fairly likely to try it. Thirty percent of the audience was not convinced that the empiric approach is the best management strategy.

Conclusion

The advantages of this management strategy should be carefully considered, and discussed with colleagues who do think it is the reasonable treatment approach in selected cases.

### Rethinking mechanisms, diagnosis and management of endometriosis [^682efa72]. Nature Reviews: Endocrinology (2019). High credibility.

Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease defined as the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, which causes pelvic pain and infertility. This disease should be viewed as a public health problem with a major effect on the quality of life of women as well as being a substantial economic burden. In light of the considerable progress with diagnostic imaging (for example, transvaginal ultrasound and MRI), exploratory laparoscopy should no longer be used to diagnose endometriotic lesions. Instead, diagnosis of endometriosis should be based on a structured process involving the combination of patient interviews, clinical examination and imaging. Notably, a diagnosis of endometriosis often leads to immediate surgery. Therefore, rethinking the diagnosis and management of endometriosis is warranted. Instead of assessing endometriosis on the day of the diagnosis, gynaecologists should consider the patient's 'endometriosis life'. Medical treatment is the first-line therapeutic option for patients with pelvic pain and no desire for immediate pregnancy. In women with infertility, careful consideration should be made regarding whether to provide assisted reproductive technologies prior to performing endometriosis surgery.

Methods

Study guidelines

Given the heterogeneity and breadth of research in this field, a scoping review was performed to summarize the use of AI applications in endometriosis research, diagnostics, and prediction to help identify gaps in knowledge and address broad research questions. The guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Review (PRISMA-ScR)and Arksey and O'Malley's recommendations for scoping review methodologywere followed. A prior review protocol was drafted using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocolsfor internal use amongst the research team but it was not externally published or registered prospectively.

Search strategy and study eligibility

The PubMed, Medline-OVID, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases were searched sequentially from January 2000 to March 2022 for all English-language papers using the following search strategy (adapted for each database): [(Endometriosis) OR (Endometrioma)] AND [(AI) OR (ML) OR (Prediction Model) OR (Classification)]. Gray literature was not included in this scoping review in attempt to only include peer-reviewed studies. This timeframe was chosen to reflect advances in AI technologies and applications in medicine. The scope of the search was not restricted to a particular type or stage of endometriosis. The search for this scoping review was completed in March 2022.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

The following inclusion criteria were used to determine study eligibility for this review: (1) the study involved assessing an AI approach or model to advance prediction, diagnosis, management or disease understanding in the field of endometriosis; (2) the study reported a quantitative metric on the accuracy/performance of the AI method; (3) the study was conducted using humans; (4) the article was accessible in English; and (5) the study used a validation method to test its model. Studies were excluded if: (1) they were not conducted using humans; (2) did not assess or evaluate an AI approach or model; (3) did not pertain to the field of endometriosis; and (4) developed a logistic regression model without the use of a training and test/validation set. One reviewer (BS) conducted the literature search and two reviewers (BS and ME) screened the titles, abstracts and full-texts independently for potentially eligible studies. Reference lists of eligible studies were also hand-searched but no additional studies were included on this basis.

### Clinical management of endometriosis [^b54d7bb0]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Endometriosis is a common and challenging condition of reproductive-aged women that carries a high individual and societal cost. The many molecular dissimilarities between endometriosis lesions and eutopic endometrium create difficulties in the development of new drug therapies and treatments. Surgery remains the gold standard for definitive diagnosis, but it must be weighed against the risks of surgical morbidity and potential decreases in ovarian reserve, especially in the case of endometriomas. Safe and effective surgical techniques are discussed within this article for various presentations of endometriosis. Medical therapy is suppressive rather than curative, and regimens that are long-term and affordable with minimal side effects are recommended. Recurrences are common and often rapid when medical therapy is discontinued. Endometriosis in the setting of infertility is reviewed and appropriate management is discussed, including when and whether surgery is warranted in this at-risk population. In patients with chronic pain, central sensitization and myofascial pain are integral components of a multidisciplinary approach. Endometriosis is associated with an increased risk of epithelial ovarian cancer; however, the risk is low and currently no preventive screening is recommended. Hormone therapy for symptomatic women with postsurgical menopause should not be delayed as a result of concerns for malignancy or recurrence of endometriosis.

### Advances in non-invasive diagnostic tools for endometriosis: a narrative review of the past ten years [^8937fca2]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Endometriosis is a chronic condition defined by endometrium-like tissue outside the uterus, with symptoms including pain, infertility, and fatigue. Despite the high prevalence of disease, diagnosis is frequently delayed, in part due to reliance on invasive procedures such as laparoscopy. Over the past decade, scientific research and international collaborations have focused on the development of non-invasive diagnostic tools to allow earlier detection and reduce the burden of surgical diagnosis. This narrative review summarizes key developments in non-invasive tools over the past decade. These advances include those in the biomarker space, imaging techniques and protocols, and artificial intelligence applications. While no single test has yet replaced laparoscopy, significant strides have been made toward safer, earlier diagnosis. Continued interdisciplinary collaboration, standardization of imaging and research protocols, and large-scale validation studies are essential for translating these findings into clinical practice.

### Evaluation and treatment of endometriosis [^9d26eb72]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Endometriosis, which affects up to 10 percent of reproductive-aged women, is the presence of endometrial tissue outside of the uterine cavity. It is more common in women with pelvic pain or infertility (25 to 40 percent and 70 to 90 percent, respectively). Some women with endometriosis are asymptomatic, whereas others present with symptoms such as debilitating pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, and decreased fertility. Diagnosis of endometriosis in primary care is predominantly clinical. Initial treatment includes common agents used for primary dysmenorrhea, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, combination estrogen/progestin contraceptives, or progestin-only contraceptives. There is some evidence that these agents are helpful and have few adverse effects. Referral to a gynecologist is necessary if symptoms persist or the patient is unable to become pregnant. Laparoscopy is commonly used to confirm the diagnosis before additional treatments are pursued. Further treatments include gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogues, danazol, or surgical removal of ectopic endometrial tissue. These interventions may control symptoms more effectively than initial treatments, but they can have significant adverse effects and limits on duration of therapy.

### Endometriosis: clinical features, MR imaging findings and pathologic correlation [^b629489b]. Insights Into Imaging (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Endometriosis is a chronic condition affecting women during the reproductive lifespan. Diagnosis of endometriosis must take into account clinical symptoms, physical examination, laboratory tests and different imaging techniques. Since pelvic anatomy is complex and may vary with distortion by invasive endometriosis, the radiologist must be aware of both normal and deranged anatomy.

The ideal purpose of surgery is a therapeutic and effective intervention based on a careful preoperative evaluation. From this point of view, the role of MR imaging to help diagnose and plan surgical strategy is critical in the management of the disease. Preoperative detection of all endometriotic lesions is recommended to choose the surgical approach and to plan a multidisciplinary team work. This multidisciplinary approach including radiologists, gynaecologists, urologists, gastrointestinal surgeons, and (in selected cases) neurosurgeons, is recommended to improve diagnostic imaging accuracy and patients' outcome, and to reduce postoperative complication rates. The recent awareness that endometriosis may be medically treated based on strong clinical suspicion and that laparoscopy should be intended for surgical treatment, not for diagnostic purposes, furtherly enhance the role of non-invasive diagnostic procedures and particularly of MR imaging.

In any case, due to the complexity of the disease, it is appropriate to centralize the overall care of endometriosis patients to reference centres in order to pursue a patient-centred approach tailored to the patient's specific condition and desires.

### Endometriosis: a review [^c176f0e9]. JAMA (2025). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Endometriosis is a chronic, estrogen-dependent, inflammatory disease defined by endometrial-like tissue (lesions) outside the uterine lining. It affects up to 10% of women worldwide, and 9 million women in the US, during reproductive years.

Observations

Endometriosis has varying clinical presentations; however, 90% of people with endometriosis report pelvic pain, including dysmenorrhea, nonmenstrual pelvic pain, and dyspareunia, and 26% report infertility. Risk factors for endometriosis include younger age at menarche, shorter menstrual cycle length, lower body mass index, nulliparity, and congenital obstructive müllerian anomalies such as obstructed hemivagina. Although definitive diagnosis requires surgical visualization of lesions, a suspected clinical diagnosis can be made based on symptoms, supported by physical examination findings and imaging with transvaginal ultrasound and/or pelvic magnetic resonance imaging; normal physical examination and imaging do not exclude the diagnosis. The diagnosis is often delayed, averaging 5 to 12 years after onset of symptoms, with most women consulting 3 or more clinicians prior to diagnosis. Hormonal medications, such as combined oral contraceptives and progestin-only options, are first-line treatment and should be offered to symptomatic premenopausal women who do not currently desire pregnancy. In a network meta-analysis (n = 1680, 15 clinical trials), hormonal treatments including combined oral contraceptives, progestins, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists led to clinically significant pain reduction compared with placebo, with mean differences ranging between 13.15 and 17.6 points (0–100 visual analog scale) with little difference in effectiveness among options. However, 11% to 19% of individuals with endometriosis have no pain reduction with hormonal medications and 25% to 34% experience recurrent pelvic pain within 12 months of discontinuing hormonal treatment. Surgical removal of lesions, usually with laparoscopy, should be considered if first-line hormonal therapies are ineffective or contraindicated. Second-line hormone therapies include GnRH agonists and antagonists, and third-line treatments include aromatase inhibitors. Hysterectomy with surgical removal of lesions may be considered when initial treatments are ineffective. However, approximately 25% of patients who undergo hysterectomy for endometriosis experience recurrent pelvic pain and 10% undergo additional surgery, such as lysis of adhesions, to treat pain.

Conclusions and Relevance

Endometriosis is a common cause of pelvic pain affecting approximately 10% of reproductive-age women. Hormonal suppression with combined estrogen-progestin contraceptives or progestins is first-line treatment for women who are not seeking immediate pregnancy. Surgical removal of endometriosis lesions may be performed if hormonal therapies are ineffective or contraindicated, and hysterectomy may be considered if medical treatments and surgical removal of lesions do not relieve symptoms.

- laparoscopic uterine nerve ablation alone does not offer significant relief of endometriosis-related pain

- laparoscopic treatment of minimal or mild endometriosis improves pregnancy rates regardless of the treatment modality

- the effect on fertility of surgical treatment of deeply infiltrating endometriosis is controversial

- laparoscopic excision of ovarian endometriomas > 3 cm in diameter may improve fertility

- if a patient with known endometriosis is to undergo IVF, GnRH agonist suppression with add-back hormone therapy for 3 to 6 months before IVF is associated with an improved pregnancy rate.

### A review and algorithm in the diagnosis and treatment of sacroiliac joint pain [^521780d2]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Low back pain (LBP) is among the most common human health problems and accounts for a significant amount of disability worldwide. It is a challenging condition to diagnose and treat given its unclear pathology, multifactorial causes, biopsychosocial aspects, and poorly defined treatment algorithms. Interestingly, the SIJ has been estimated to contribute to pain in as much as 38% of cases of LBP. Given these findings, it is felt that SIJ pain is highly underdiagnosed and also undertreated. In addition, there is no clear diagnostic or treatment pathway once identified. In this article, we reviewed the diagnostic criteria and treatment options to begin to establish a clearer pathway and algorithm for patients.

Patients generally present with pain below the belt line or isolated over the SIJ. Radiation can be most commonly into the posterior leg, groin, or buttock. There is usually an absence of thigh pain, especially in older patients. In addition to SI joint dysfunction, clinicians should be aware of broader differential diagnosis in regards to other possible sources of posterior hip and lower back pain. In addition to other common spinal pathologies such as the lower facet joints and lumbar discs, other pathologies such as tarlov cysts, pudendal nerve entrapments, hamstring tendinopathies, and piriformis syndrome should also be considered. Additionally in female patients, intrapelvic sources such as endometriosis and pelvic varicosities should be considered. The sacroiliac joint is also affected by the lack of movement in the hip joint. Hip abnormalities limiting flexion can cause increased strain on sacroiliac joint, while limitation in hip extension is also reported by some authors in association with low back pain.

### Imaging modalities for the non-invasive diagnosis of endometriosis [^acfc531b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

About 10% of women of reproductive age suffer from endometriosis. Endometriosis is a costly chronic disease that causes pelvic pain and subfertility. Laparoscopy, the gold standard diagnostic test for endometriosis, is expensive and carries surgical risks. Currently, no non-invasive tests that can be used to accurately diagnose endometriosis are available in clinical practice. This is the first review of diagnostic test accuracy of imaging tests for endometriosis that uses Cochrane methods to provide an update on the rapidly expanding literature in this field.

Objectives

- To provide estimates of the diagnostic accuracy of imaging modalities for the diagnosis of pelvic endometriosis, ovarian endometriosis and deeply infiltrating endometriosis (DIE) versus surgical diagnosis as a reference standard.• To describe performance of imaging tests for mapping of deep endometriotic lesions in the pelvis at specific anatomical sites. Imaging tests were evaluated as replacement tests for diagnostic surgery and as triage tests that would assist decision making regarding diagnostic surgery for endometriosis.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases to 20 April 2015: MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, LILACS, OAIster, TRIP, ClinicalTrials.gov, MEDION, DARE, and PubMed. Searches were not restricted to a particular study design or language nor to specific publication dates. The search strategy incorporated words in the title, abstracts, text words across the record and medical subject headings (MeSH).

Selection Criteria

We considered published peer-reviewed cross-sectional studies and randomised controlled trials of any size that included prospectively recruited women of reproductive age suspected of having one or more of the following target conditions: endometrioma, pelvic endometriosis, DIE or endometriotic lesions at specific intrapelvic anatomical locations. We included studies that compared the diagnostic test accuracy of one or more imaging modalities versus findings of surgical visualisation of endometriotic lesions.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently collected and performed a quality assessment of data from each study. For each imaging test, data were classified as positive or negative for surgical detection of endometriosis, and sensitivity and specificity estimates were calculated. If two or more tests were evaluated in the same cohort, each was considered as a separate data set. We used the bivariate model to obtain pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity when sufficient data sets were available. Predetermined criteria for a clinically useful imaging test to replace diagnostic surgery included sensitivity ≥ 94% and specificity ≥ 79%. Criteria for triage tests were set at sensitivity ≥ 95% and specificity ≥ 50%, ruling out the diagnosis with a negative result (SnNout test - if sensitivity is high, a negative test rules out pathology) or at sensitivity ≥ 50% with specificity ≥ 95%, ruling in the diagnosis with a positive result (SpPin test - if specificity is high, a positive test rules in pathology).

Main Results

We included 49 studies involving 4807 women: 13 studies evaluated pelvic endometriosis, 10 endometriomas and 15 DIE, and 33 studies addressed endometriosis at specific anatomical sites. Most studies were of poor methodological quality. The most studied modalities were transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with outcome measures commonly demonstrating diversity in diagnostic estimates; however, sources of heterogeneity could not be reliably determined. No imaging test met the criteria for a replacement or triage test for detecting pelvic endometriosis, albeit TVUS approached the criteria for a SpPin triage test. For endometrioma, TVUS (eight studies, 765 participants; sensitivity 0.93 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87, 0.99), specificity 0.96 (95% CI 0.92, 0.99)) qualified as a SpPin triage test and approached the criteria for a replacement and SnNout triage test, whereas MRI (three studies, 179 participants; sensitivity 0.95 (95% CI 0.90, 1.00), specificity 0.91 (95% CI 0.86, 0.97)) met the criteria for a replacement and SnNout triage test and approached the criteria for a SpPin test. For DIE, TVUS (nine studies, 12 data sets, 934 participants; sensitivity 0.79 (95% CI 0.69, 0.89) and specificity 0.94 (95% CI 0.88, 1.00)) approached the criteria for a SpPin triage test, and MRI (six studies, seven data sets, 266 participants; sensitivity 0.94 (95% CI 0.90, 0.97), specificity 0.77 (95% CI 0.44, 1.00)) approached the criteria for a replacement and SnNout triage test. Other imaging tests assessed in small individual studies could not be statistically evaluated.TVUS met the criteria for a SpPin triage test in mapping DIE to uterosacral ligaments, rectovaginal septum, vaginal wall, pouch of Douglas (POD) and rectosigmoid. MRI met the criteria for a SpPin triage test for POD and vaginal and rectosigmoid endometriosis. Transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS) might qualify as a SpPin triage test for rectosigmoid involvement but could not be adequately assessed for other anatomical sites because heterogeneous data were scant. Multi-detector computerised tomography enema (MDCT-e) displayed the highest diagnostic performance for rectosigmoid and other bowel endometriosis and met the criteria for both SpPin and SnNout triage tests, but studies were too few to provide meaningful results. Diagnostic accuracies were higher for TVUS with bowel preparation (TVUS-BP) and rectal water contrast (RWC-TVS) and for 3.0TMRI than for conventional methods, although the paucity of studies precluded statistical evaluation.

Authors' Conclusions

None of the evaluated imaging modalities were able to detect overall pelvic endometriosis with enough accuracy that they would be suggested to replace surgery. Specifically for endometrioma, TVUS qualified as a SpPin triage test. MRI displayed sufficient accuracy to suggest utility as a replacement test, but the data were too scant to permit meaningful conclusions. TVUS could be used clinically to identify additional anatomical sites of DIE compared with MRI, thus facilitating preoperative planning. Rectosigmoid endometriosis was the only site that could be accurately mapped by using TVUS, TRUS, MRI or MDCT-e. Studies evaluating recent advances in imaging modalities such as TVUS-BP, RWC-TVS, 3.0TMRI and MDCT-e were observed to have high diagnostic accuracies but were too few to allow prudent evaluation of their diagnostic role. In view of the low quality of most of the included studies, the findings of this review should be interpreted with caution. Future well-designed diagnostic studies undertaken to compare imaging tests for diagnostic test accuracy and costs are recommended.

### A new validated screening method for endometriosis diagnosis based on patient questionnaires [^81f7f787]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

We are at a key stage regarding the diagnosis and management of endometriosis, both of which warrant being extensively reconsidered. As histological diagnosis is no longer required to initiate treatment(s), there is a high level of interest in non-invasive (i.e. non-surgical) ways to diagnose endometriosis. The selection of patients requiring a radiological evaluation based on a simple patient questionnaire is crucial for the medical care. Very high-risk patients need to be referred to a multidisciplinary specialized team (expert radiologists, multidisciplinary surgical team (gynecological, GI, urological, and thoracic surgeons), assisted reproductive technology (ART) specialists, gynecological endocrinologists, pathologists, physiotherapists, psychologists, etc.). If a patient is at high risk with a negative radiological examination, SPE cannot be excluded, and the patient is managed accordingly for suspected endometriosis. This new paradigm regarding endometriosis diagnosis, based on the patient's clinical history and imaging, allows use of a non-surgical procedure to devise an individualized therapeutic strategy (medical treatment, surgery, or ART) for each patient. In selected cases, medical treatment and ART can be satisfactory alternatives to surgery, which is usually proposed too often as the first therapeutic option.

In conclusion, we have developed two internally and externally validated scores based solely on 8 and 5 items, respectively, from a patient questionnaire that reliably predict the probability of endometriosis. These scores may have high clinical value, allowing the selection of patients at high-risk of endometriosis with a cost-effective procedure that can readily be performed by the patient herself. These scores will contribute to shortening the delay of the diagnosis and improvement of the management, wellbeing, and quality of life of patients. The accumulation of data is likely to help progressively improve the performance of this straightforward and cost-effective screening score.

### Surgical management of endometriosis-associated pain [^a2d25c7e]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

General surgical guidelines are reasonable, but treatment frequently must be individualized. Laparoscopic coagulation can be used for many cases of superficial endometriosis. Resection seems to be associated with an increased resolution of endometriosis. Resection increases the difficulty of the procedure, the time of the operation, and the cost, however. When endometriosis is found coincidentally, it may need no treatment because many women have endometriosis as a self-limited disease. Distinguishing patients who need no treatment from patients who need intermediate or extensive treatment can be difficult. Care is needed to attempt to ensure that patients are neither overtreated nor undertreated.
