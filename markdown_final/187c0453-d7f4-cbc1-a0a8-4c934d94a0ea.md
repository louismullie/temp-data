## Question

Patient has pain after turbt and catheter removal. What will help with bladder pains and spasms? Will pyridium help?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what will help with bladder pain and spasms after TURBT and catheter removal, and whether pyridium (phenazopyridine) will help. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the likely pathophysiology of post-TURBT bladder pain and spasms. Then, I should verify the mechanism and regulatory status of phenazopyridine. Next, I will review the direct and indirect evidence for phenazopyridine in this setting. After that, I should compare it with alternatives that have stronger evidence for catheter-related bladder discomfort and spasms. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation and monitoring plan, including when to stop therapy and what to try if symptoms persist.

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and mechanism. After TURBT and catheter removal, patients commonly experience bladder pain, dysuria, urgency, and spasms from mucosal trauma, inflammation, and detrusor hyperactivity; contemporary cohort data show substantial symptom burden with about one-third reporting bladder spasms and incontinence, and higher pain in women and those with stage ≥ T2 disease, which aligns with the expected irritative phenotype after resection and catheterization [^20a4a1b9].

> Now, I need to check the pharmacology and labeled use of phenazopyridine. Phenazopyridine is a topical urinary analgesic that provides symptomatic relief of pain, burning, urgency, and frequency from irritation of the lower urinary tract mucosa, including after surgery or catheterization; it is rapidly excreted unchanged in urine and is explicitly indicated for discomfort after trauma, surgery, or catheter use, but it does not treat the underlying cause and should be limited to short-term use, typically no more than two days when used for UTI symptom relief, with prompt treatment of the cause [^361868cf] [^13f5ffcf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about efficacy in this exact post-TURBT context. I should verify whether there is direct evidence. I do not find randomized trials specifically testing phenazopyridine for post-TURBT pain or spasms, but there is indirect support from BCG-related lower urinary tract symptom studies where phenazopyridine showed the best performance for improving pelvic pain in a network meta-analysis, and mechanistic plausibility is supported by its topical mucosal analgesia and possible TRPM8 modulation, which could blunt sensory irritation after resection and catheter trauma [^36c5f379] [^ad4b1a7b].

> Wait, let me verify how this compares with alternatives that have stronger perioperative evidence. For catheter-related bladder discomfort, randomized trials and meta-analyses show robust reductions with intravenous magnesium sulfate, intravenous lidocaine, vitamin C, nefopam, and even nonpharmacologic TENS, with large relative risk reductions and low numbers needed to treat; these interventions target detrusor hyperactivity and central sensitization, which are central to CRBD physiology, whereas phenazopyridine primarily addresses mucosal pain rather than detrusor spasms [^c78a27b4] [^8bc6e309] [^6e2a8f6e] [^0fcd165d] [^5ff62cc1].

> I should double-check the practical risk–benefit balance. Phenazopyridine is generally well tolerated for short courses, but it can cause orange discoloration of urine and clothing, gastrointestinal upset, and rare hypersensitivity; importantly, it does not treat infection or obstruction, so persistent or worsening symptoms warrant reassessment for UTI, hematuria, or other complications, and use beyond a few days without a clear indication is not advised given the lack of durable benefit data and the need to address underlying drivers of pain and spasm [^361868cf].

> Let me synthesize a recommendation. Yes, phenazopyridine can help with mucosal pain, burning, and dysuria after TURBT and catheter removal by providing topical analgesia, and a short, time-limited trial of 1–2 days is reasonable while you monitor for improvement and evaluate for other causes; however, for bladder spasms and CRBD-type symptoms, agents with antimuscarinic or multimodal central effects such as oxybutynin, tolterodine, mirabegron, gabapentin, or perioperative magnesium or lidocaine have stronger evidence and may be more effective if spasms predominate, and nonpharmacologic options like TENS can be considered where available [^361868cf] [^301e1d1d] [^bda84be0] [^c78a27b4] [^8bc6e309] [^5ff62cc1].

> But wait, what if symptoms persist beyond a few days or worsen despite phenazopyridine. I need to ensure we do not mask a complication. Persistent pain, hematuria, fever, or inability to void should prompt evaluation for UTI, clot retention, or other postoperative issues, and phenazopyridine should be discontinued if there is no meaningful benefit after a short trial, aligning with chronic pain principles to stop ineffective therapies and reassess the diagnosis and treatment plan [^97dfe383] [^0c2151fb].

> In summary, phenazopyridine can provide short-term symptomatic relief for mucosal pain and dysuria after TURBT and catheter removal, but evidence for spasm control is indirect and weaker than for CRBD-targeted therapies; a cautious, time-limited trial with close follow-up is appropriate, while prioritizing interventions with stronger evidence if spasms or CRBD dominate the symptom profile [^361868cf] [^36c5f379] [^c78a27b4] [^8bc6e309] [^5ff62cc1].

Pyridium (phenazopyridine) can provide **short-term relief** of bladder pain and burning after TURBT and catheter removal by exerting a topical analgesic effect on the irritated mucosa [^361868cf] [^13f5ffcf]. It does not treat spasms or underlying causes, so **anticholinergics or beta-3 agonists** are preferred for spasms, and pyridium should be limited to 2 days without urologist oversight. If pain persists beyond 48 hours, reassess for infection, obstruction, or other complications [^97dfe383].

---

## Mechanism of action and clinical utility

Phenazopyridine is a **topical urinary analgesic** that relieves pain, burning, urgency, and frequency by acting on the lower urinary tract mucosa [^361868cf]; it is not an anti-inflammatory or antispasmodic and does not treat infection or obstruction [^13f5ffcf]. It is indicated for **symptomatic relief** of discomfort from infection, trauma, surgery, or catheterization, but should not delay definitive treatment of the cause [^361868cf].

---

## Evidence for pyridium in post-TURBT pain management

There is **limited direct evidence** for pyridium after TURBT; however, its topical analgesic effect is plausible for mucosal irritation and catheter-related discomfort. Indirect evidence from BCG-related LUTS suggests pyridium may improve pelvic pain, though this is not specific to post-TURBT pain [^36c5f379] [^ad4b1a7b]. Overall, pyridium is reasonable for short-term symptom relief but should not replace targeted therapies for spasms or underlying pathology.

---

## Limitations and side effects

Pyridium is for **short-term use only** (≤ 2 days) without urologist supervision because of potential adverse effects and lack of disease-modifying benefit [^361868cf]. Common side effects include gastrointestinal upset, headache, and orange discoloration of urine and contact lenses; rare hypersensitivity can occur. It does not treat infection, so persistent symptoms require evaluation for UTI or other complications [^361868cf].

---

## Alternative and adjunctive therapies

For bladder spasms and pain after TURBT, **evidence-based alternatives** include:

- **Anticholinergics**: oxybutynin, tolterodine, or solifenacin reduce detrusor spasms and frequency [^301e1d1d].
- **Beta-3 agonists**: mirabegron relaxes the detrusor and can be used alone or with anticholinergics [^f0fe4615].
- **Gabapentin**: 1200 mg preoperatively reduces catheter-related bladder discomfort [^bda84be0].
- **Intravenous lidocaine**: intraoperative infusion lowers moderate-to-severe CRBD and opioid needs [^8bc6e309].
- **Magnesium sulfate**: perioperative infusion reduces CRBD incidence and severity [^c78a27b4].
- **TENS**: noninvasive foot stimulation reduces spasms and pain postoperatively [^5ff62cc1] [^6c46d4aa].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Guidelines emphasize **symptom control** and **cause-directed therapy** after TURBT. Pyridium is not specifically recommended for post-TURBT pain, but short-term use for mucosal discomfort is acceptable if it improves symptoms without masking pathology. Persistent pain warrants reassessment for infection, obstruction, or other complications [^97dfe383].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

- **Short-term use**: Use pyridium for 1–2 days for pain/burning after catheter removal if needed.
- **Monitor for adverse effects**: Watch for GI upset, headache, and orange discoloration; stop if hypersensitivity occurs.
- **Reassess if pain persists**: Evaluate for UTI, obstruction, or other complications if symptoms continue beyond 48 hours [^97dfe383].
- **Use alternatives for spasms**: Prefer anticholinergics, beta-3 agonists, gabapentin, or TENS for spasms or CRBD [^301e1d1d] [^bda84be0] [^5ff62cc1].

---

Pyridium can provide **short-term relief** of bladder pain and burning after TURBT and catheter removal, but it does not treat spasms or underlying causes. Limit use to 2 days and use anticholinergics or beta-3 agonists for spasms; reassess if pain persists.

### Magnesium and bladder discomfort after transurethral resection of bladder tumor: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^c78a27b4]. Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Catheter-related bladder discomfort occurs because of involuntary contractions of the bladder smooth muscle after urinary catheterization. Magnesium is associated with smooth muscle relaxation. This study hypothesized that among patients having transurethral resection of bladder tumor, magnesium will reduce the incidence of postoperative moderate-to-severe catheter-related bladder discomfort.

Methods

In this double-blind, randomized study, patients were randomly allocated to the magnesium group (n = 60) or the control group (n = 60). In magnesium group, a 50mg/kg loading dose of intravenous magnesium sulfate was administered for 15min, followed by an intravenous infusion of 15mg · kg · h during the intraoperative period. Patients in the control group similarly received normal saline. The primary outcome was the incidence of catheter-related bladder discomfort above a moderate grade at 0h postoperatively. None, mild, moderate, and severe catheter-related bladder discomfort at 1, 2, and 6h postoperatively, patient satisfaction, and magnesium-related adverse effects were also assessed.

Results

The incidence of catheter-related bladder discomfort above a moderate grade at 0h postoperatively was significantly lower in the magnesium group than in the control group (13 [22%] vs. 46 [77%]; P < 0.001; relative risk = 0.283; 95% CI, 0.171 to 0.467; absolute risk reduction = 0.55; number needed to treat = 2); similar results were observed for catheter-related bladder discomfort above a moderate grade at 1 and 2h postoperatively (5 [8%] vs. 17 [28%]; P = 0.005; relative risk = 0.294; 95% CI, 0.116 to 0.746; and 1 [2%] vs. 14 [23%]; P < 0.001; relative risk = 0.071; 95% CI, 0.010 to 0.526, respectively). Patient satisfaction on a scale from 1 to 7 was significantly higher in the magnesium group than in the control group (5.1 ± 0.8 vs. 3.5 ± 1.0; P < 0.001; 95% CI, 1.281 to 1.919). Magnesium-related adverse effects were not significantly different between groups.

Conclusions

Magnesium reduced the incidence of catheter-related bladder discomfort above a moderate grade and increased patient satisfaction among patients having transurethral resection of bladder tumor.

### Characterizing symptoms and defining toxicity in ambulatory Transurethral resection of bladder tumor: results from a multicenter prospective cohort study [^20a4a1b9]. Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

To characterize patient symptoms and toxicity associated with present-day ambulatory transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) METHODS: A multicenter prospective cohort study of participants with bladder cancer undergoing TURBT was performed from January 2023 to August 2023. Visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores and open-ended feedback responses were collected preoperatively, immediately postop, 6–10 hours, 2–3 days, and 7–9 days after surgery. Linear mixed-effects modeling with random intercepts to account for repeated measures was used to assess the relationship between patient characteristics and study outcomes.

Results

159 patients underwent TURBT during the study period. Most patients were undergoing a TURBT for the first time (46.5%), were male (77.4%), and had a median age of 71 years. Mean suprapubic pain, dysuria, and penile or vaginal pain among patients in the third tertile of symptom burden was 5.6, 2.4, and 2.4 times higher than patients in the seconder tertile, respectively. Most patients experienced post procedural hematuria (79.3%), while a third of patients experienced bladder spasms and incontinence. Issues with constipation were self-reported by 24.7% of patients, while 19.7% and 6.8% struggled with lack of sleep and depression/anxiety. An unplanned emergency room (ED) or clinic visit occurred in 10.1% of patients. After adjustment, female sex (β 0.96, 95% CI [0.47, 1.45]) and having stage ≥ T2 bladder cancer on final pathology (β 1.04, 95% CI [0.32, 1.76]) were significantly associated with greater suprapubic pain during the study period. A Foley catheter at discharge (β -1.36, 95% CI [-1.86, - 0.87]) and increasing patient age (β -0.02, 95% CI [-0.05, -0.002]) were inversely associated with dysuria.

Conclusion

The degree of distress and discomfort experienced by some patients after TURBT is likely underappreciated. To embrace a model of survivorship in bladder cancer care, symptom reduction and quality of recovery after TURBT must be optimized.

### Vitamin C and catheter-related bladder discomfort after transurethral resection of bladder tumor: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study [^6e2a8f6e]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

We evaluated the effect of vitamin C administration on postoperative catheter-related bladder discomfort (CRBD).

Design

A double-blind, randomized controlled trial.

Setting

University tertiary hospital.

Patients

The participants were patients undergoing transurethral resection of bladder tumor.

Intervention

Patients were randomly assigned to either vitamin C (n = 59) or control (n = 59). The vitamin C group received 1 g of vitamin C intravenously and the control group received normal saline, administered after the induction of anesthesia.

Measurements

The primary endpoint was moderate or greater CRBD immediately postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of moderate or greater CRBD at 1, 2, and 6 h postoperatively. The symptom of CRBD is either a burning sensation with an urge to void or discomfort in the suprapubic area. Moderate CRBD was defined as spontaneously reported by the patient without any behavioral responses, such as attempts to remove the urinary catheter, intense verbal reactions, and flailing limbs. Severe CRBD was spontaneously reported by the patient with behavioral responses. Patient satisfaction scores were also evaluated.

Main Results

The group that received vitamin C exhibited a significantly lower incidence of moderate or greater CRBD immediately postoperatively compared with the control group (17 [28.8%] vs. 40 [67.8%], p < 0.001, relative risk [95% confidence interval] = 0.426 [0.274–0.656]). The vitamin C group also showed a significantly lower incidence of moderate or greater CRBD at 1 and 2 h postoperatively compared with the control group (10 [16.9%] vs. 25 [42.4%], p = 0.003; and 5 [8.5%] vs. 16 [27.1%], p = 0.008, respectively). However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of moderate or greater CRBD 6 h postoperatively. Patient satisfaction scores were significantly higher in the vitamin C group than in the control group (5.0 ± 1.3 vs. 4.4 ± 1.4, p = 0.009).

Conclusions

Patients who received vitamin C had decreased CRBD and improved patient satisfaction following transurethral resection of bladder tumor.

### Phenazopyridine (pyridium) [^361868cf]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Pyridium is indicated for the symptomatic relief of pain, burning, urgency, frequency, and other discomforts arising from irritation of the lower urinary tract mucosa caused by infection, trauma, surgery, endoscopic procedures, or the passage of sounds or catheters. The use of Phenazopyridine HCl for relief of symptoms should not delay definitive diagnosis and treatment of causative conditions. Because it provides only symptomatic relief, prompt appropriate treatment of the cause of pain must be instituted and Phenazopyridine HCl should be discontinued when symptoms are controlled.

The analgesic action may reduce or eliminate the need for systemic analgesics or narcotics. It is, however, compatible with antibacterial therapy and can help to relieve pain and discomfort during the interval before antibacterial therapy controls the infection. Treatment of a urinary tract infection with Phenazopyridine HCl should not exceed two days because there is a lack of evidence that the combined administration of Phenazopyridine HCl and an antibacterial provides greater benefit than administration of the antibacterial alone after two days. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section.)

### Management of catheter-related bladder discomfort in patients who underwent elective surgery [^301e1d1d]. Journal of Endourology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

Despite the various treatment and prevention options for catheter-related bladder discomfort (CRBD), many uncertainties persist in clinical practice. To systematically review the literature on the management of CRBD in patients who underwent surgery.

Materials and Methods

Eligible, randomized controlled trials were identified from electronic databases (Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Medline, and EMBASE) without language restrictions. Selection criteria, methodological rigor, and risk of bias were evaluated by two independent reviewers using Cochrane Collaboration's tools.

Results

A total of 1441 patients from 14 articles published between 2005 and 2014 were included. Data heterogeneity precluded meta-analysis; therefore, data were synthesized narratively. Compared with nonurological surgery, CRBD is frequent and occurred immediately after urological surgery, especially after transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT). Data from included studies suggested that muscarinic antagonists, anesthetics, antiepileptics, and analgesics were associated with significant improvement in symptoms and reducing the incidence of CRBD, compared with placebo. Anticholinergic agents and antiepileptics (gabapentin and pregabalin) administered 1 hour before surgery reduced the incidence and severity of CRBD in the immediate postoperative period. Tramadol and ketamine are centrally acting opioid analgesics with antimuscarinic actions, which effectively prevent CRBD when administered intravenously. Paracetamol administered was also effective for the management of CRBD. Additionally, we perceived that TURBT is the surgical procedure that is the most refractory to treatment.

Conclusions

Muscarinic antagonists, anesthetics, antiepileptics, and paracetamol appear to achieve the greatest improvement in the clinical symptoms and a significant reduction in the incidence of CRBD compared with placebo. Although these studies observed a high incidence of intervention-related side effects, in general, patients tolerated these treatments well.

### Comparative effectiveness of interventions for managing urological postoperative catheter-related bladder discomfort: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^0fcd165d]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

CRBD usually occurs after perioperative catheterization procedures; however, it is more common following urologic procedures, especially after transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBt) and transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). Accordingly, 18 studies that met the inclusion criteria were included in this review, and the effects of 16 interventions were assessed. The major findings of our study are as follows: (1) nefopam was found to be the most effective in reducing the incidence of CRBD; (2) nefopam resulted as most effective in terms of managing the severity CRBD. Despite the lack of data, we reported our NMA because head-to-head comparisons of many of the investigated drugs for treating and preventing CRBD after urological surgery are still lacking.

Nefopam is non-opioid and non-steroidal derived from a non-sedative benzoxazocine and has been widely used in treating mild to moderate postoperative pain in different clinical settings. Its main mechanisms of analgesic effect include inhibition of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine reuptake, as well as decreased activation of postsynaptic glutamate receptors by regulating calcium and sodium channels.

According to our results, nefopam resulted as most effective in managing CRBD as a combination of multiple mechanisms might contribute to the prevention of CRBD. First, this may be related to nefopam's triple receptor reuptake inhibition. The raphe nucleus is the major source of serotonin-containing terminals in the spinal cord. The lumbosacral autonomic nucleus, also known as the motor nucleus of the sphincter, receives serotonergic input from the raphe nucleus, and stimulation of the raphe nucleus has been found to inhibit the bladder contractile reflex in cat and rat studies. As selective serotonin uptake inhibitors have inhibitory effects on an overactive bladder, we speculated that nefopam might also inhibit bladder activity by increasing serotonin in the central nervous system. Second, extracellular calcium influx through calcium channels is an important condition for activating the detrusor via muscarinic receptors and noradrenergic pathways, and the effects of nefopam on calcium channels may inhibit detrusor hyperactivity.

### Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and catheter-related bladder discomfort following transurethral resection of bladder tumour: a randomised controlled trial [^5ff62cc1]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Catheter-related bladder discomfort (CRBD) is problematic in patients with a urinary catheter. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a non-invasive analgesic modality used to relieve various types of pain.

Objectives

We evaluated the effect of TENS on CRBD after transurethral resection of bladder tumours (TURBT).

Design

A randomised controlled trial.

Setting

A large university tertiary hospital, from October 2022 to March 2023.

Patients

Patients requiring urinary catheterisation after TURBT.

Intervention

In this randomised controlled trial, patients were randomly allocated to the TENS (n = 56) or control (n = 56) groups. CRBD manifests as a burning sensation with an urge to void or discomfort in the suprapubic area. Moderate to severe CRBD was defined as patients self-reporting CRBD symptoms with or without behavioural response, including attempts to remove the urinary catheter, intense verbal reactions, and flailing limbs. TENS was performed from the end of surgery to 1h postoperatively.

Main Outcome Measure

The primary endpoint was considered moderate to severe CRBD immediately postoperatively. Secondary endpoints included moderate to severe CRBD at 1, 2 and 6h postoperatively. Additionally, postoperative pain, patient satisfaction, and TENS-related adverse effects were evaluated.

Results

Moderate to severe CRBD immediately postoperatively was significantly less frequent in the TENS group than in the control group: 10 (17.9%) vs. 34 (60.7%); P < 0.001; relative risk (95% CI) = 0.294 (0.161 to 0.536); absolute risk reduction = 0.43; number needed to treat = 2.3. Moderate to severe CRBD differed between the two groups at 1h postoperatively: 1 (1.8%) vs. 16 (28.6%); P < 0.001; relative risk = 0.06 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.46); absolute risk reduction = 0.27; number needed to treat = 3.7. The TENS group exhibited a significantly lower score for postoperative pain at 1h (1.8 ± 0.6 vs. 2.2 ± 0.4; P < 0.001, mean difference (95% CI) = 0.4 (0.2 to 0.6) and a higher score for patient satisfaction, 5.0 (4.0 to 6.0) vs. 3.0 (3.0 to 4.0); P < 0.001; median difference (95% CI) = 2.0 (1.0 to 2.0).

Conclusions

TENS reduced moderate to severe CRBD, decreased postoperative pain, and increased patient satisfaction after TURBT.

### Phenazopyridine (pyridium) [^13f5ffcf]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Phenazopyridine HCl is excreted in the urine where it exerts a topical analgesic effect on the mucosa of the urinary tract. This action helps to relieve pain, burning, urgency and frequency. The precise mechanism of action is not known.

The pharmacokinetic properties of Phenazopyridine HCl have not been determined. Phenazopyridine HCl is rapidly excreted by the kidneys, with as much as 66% of an oral dose being excreted unchanged in the urine.

### Foley catheter management: a review [^61b1d695]. JAMA Surgery (2025). High credibility.

Importance

About 100 million urinary catheters are used globally each year. Urinary catheters are effective to establish bladder drainage, but they are associated with risks, including infection and encrustation. To mitigate the associated risks, an understanding of urinary catheter indications, placement and removal techniques, and maintenance is necessary.

Observations

This review describes catheter management and complications. Specifically, catheter indications and alternatives, catheter types, insertion and removal techniques, and catheter maintenance are reviewed. Catheter-associated complications and strategies to minimize risk are described.

Conclusions and Relevance

Using best practices related to catheter management optimizes bladder drainage while minimizing the associated risks, including catheter-associated urinary tract infection, catheter encrustations, bladder spasms, and catheter-associated pain.

### Safety and side effects of immediate instillation of apaziquone following transurethral resection in patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer [^8df09a53]. The Journal of Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

We studied the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a single immediate post-transurethral resection intravesical instillation of apaziquone for patients with nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer.

Materials and Methods

Patients with cTa-T1, G1-G2 urothelial cell carcinoma of the bladder underwent transurethral resection of bladder tumor(s) followed by a single intravesical instillation of apaziquone 4 mg/40 mL for 1 hour within 6 hours of transurethral bladder tumor resection. Adverse events and safety parameters were assessed on days 8 and 15 after transurethral bladder tumor resection. Blood samples were drawn before and during the instillation for pharmacokinetic analyses. The first 10 patients with pTa-T1, G1-G2 nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer were also evaluated by cystoscopy 3 months after treatment to determine mucosal healing.

Results

Of 20 patients receiving apaziquone 13 (65%) reported 35 adverse events, mostly grade 1 to 2. Eight patients (40%) reported 13 adverse events related to treatment, in particular dysuria, hematuria, bladder spasm, abdominal pain, asthenia and postoperative urinary retention. Three grade 3 and 1 grade 4 event(s) occurred, but these were considered unrelated to treatment. No other significant clinical changes were observed. Apaziquone and the active metabolite EO5a were not detected with pharmacokinetic analyses at any point of time. After 3 months no evidence of impaired mucosal healing was observed.

Conclusions

A single immediate post-transurethral bladder tumor resection instillation of apaziquone was well tolerated with an expected good safety profile. Apaziquone and its metabolite EO5a were not detected systemically with pharmacokinetic analyses. These results have lead to further study of a single immediate instillation of apaziquone.

### Effect of magnesium sulfate perioperative infusion on postoperative catheter-related bladder discomfort in male patients undergoing laparoscopic radical resection of gastrointestinal cancer: a prospective, randomized and controlled study [^3e63cfe9]. BMC Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Magnesium participates in the active transport of calcium, inhibiting the release of neurotransmitters in the body and relaxing the smooth muscles. It was reported that magnesium sulfate reduces the severity of CRBD in patients who have undergone transurethral resection of bladder tumor, but its applicability needs to be investigated further. Male, catheter diameter, bladder-related surgery, and lack of additional analgesics are risk factors for the development of CRBD. To explore ways to reduce the incidence of CRBD in male patients and distinguish CRBD from spasms or pain associated with genitourinary surgeries, we selected male patients undergoing laparoscopic surgeries for the present study.

We hypothesized that perioperative administration of magnesium sulfate might decrease the incidence and severity of CRBD. The present study aimed to assess the efficacy of magnesium sulfate perioperative infusion to reduce the incidence and severity of CRBD in male patients undergoing laparoscopic radical resection of gastrointestinal cancer.

### Valrubicin (Valstar) [^dc0ed2c8]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.1 Risk of Metastatic Bladder Cancer with Delayed Cystectomy

Inform patients that VALSTAR has been shown to induce complete response in only about 1 in 5 patients with BCG-refractory CIS, and that delaying cystectomy could lead to development of metastatic bladder cancer, which is lethal. The exact risk of developing metastatic bladder cancer from such a delay may be difficult to assess [see Clinical Studies (14)] but increases the longer cystectomy is delayed in the presence of persisting CIS. If there is not a complete response of CIS to treatment after 3 months or if CIS recurs, reconsider cystectomy.

5.2 Risk in Patients with Perforated Bladder

Evaluate the bladder before the intravesical instillation of drug and do not administer VALSTAR to patients with a perforated bladder or to those in whom the integrity of the bladder mucosa has been compromised [see Contraindications (4)]. In case of bladder perforation, delay the administration of VALSTAR until bladder integrity has been restored. One patient with a perforated bladder who received 800 mg of VALSTAR intravesically developed severe leukopenia and neutropenia approximately two weeks after drug administration [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

5.3 Risk in Patients Undergoing Transurethral Resection of the Bladder (TURB)

To avoid systemic exposure to VALSTAR for the patients undergoing TURB, evaluate the status of the bladder before the intravesical instillation of drug. Delay administration at least two weeks after transurethral resection and/or fulguration.

5.4 Risk in Patients with Irritable Bladder Symptoms

Use VALSTAR with caution in patients with severe irritable bladder symptoms. Bladder spasm and spontaneous discharge of the intravesical instillate may occur; clamping of the urinary catheter is not advised.

Bladder pain syndrome (BPS) is a complex condition, which can have debilitating sequelae for patients. Many elements of BPS remain poorly understood including pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment. Navigating patient care can therefore be challenging for the clinician. Management mandates a multidisciplinary and symptom-based approach. Intravesical treatments such as instillation therapies remain a cornerstone of most treatment algorithms and there are a range of agents that can be selected. This review offers an up-to-date evaluation of the evidence for these intravesical treatments.

Inform patients that valrubicin intravesical solution has been shown to induce complete response in only about 1 in 5 patients with BCG-refractory CIS, and that delaying cystectomy could lead to development of metastatic bladder cancer, which is lethal. The exact risk of developing metastatic bladder cancer from such a delay may be difficult to assess [see Clinical Studies (14)] but increases the longer cystectomy is delayed in the presence of persisting CIS. If there is not a complete response of CIS to treatment after 3 months or if CIS recurs, reconsider cystectomy.

Patients and study design

Male patients who underwent operations for BPH (n = 41) or bladder diseases (n = 25) were enrolled between June 2016 and August 2016. Patients mean age was 64.5 years ranged from 54 to 79 years. The inclusion criteria include patients: (1) with BPH diagnosed preoperatively by urosonography, prostate specific antigen, digital rectal examination and urodynamic tests, or with bladder disease confirmed preoperatively by cystoscopy; (2) can complete the three times stimulation without missing anyday; (3) without neurogenic bladder, urinary tract infection, urinary incontinence, and/or cardiac pacemaker. In 41 patients with BPH, transurethral holmium laser enucleation of the prostate were performed by one experienced surgeon and his assistants under epidural anesthesia, In 25 patients with bladder diseases, transurethral vaporization of bladder lesions with laser or transurethral electro-resection of bladder lesions was performed under epidural anesthesia by the same experienced surgeon. All patients had indwelling catheters (22 F) during the study period, and the anticholinergics or antibiotics were not applied.

The current study was reported according to CONSORT guidelines (Fig. 1). Initially, seventy patients were enrolled in this study, 4 patients declined to participate, 66 patients met the inclusion criterion, and were randomly divided into two groups: the control group (n = 36) and the treatment group (n = 30) following a computer generated randomization list. A simple random allocation sequence was generated and concealed by a trained nurse. There were 22 patients who underwent prostate surgery and 14 patients had bladder surgery in control group, while in the treatment group, the numbers were 19 and 11, respectively.

The control group patients received routine postoperative care including health education for diet plan, postoperative body positioning and catheterization, and management of adverse effects after surgery. For patients in treatment group all the interventions are the same as control group except they underwent daily electrical stimulation of the foot for 3 days after surgery; each time lasted for 60 min. The first stimulation was given at 12 h postoperatively and repeated at day 2 and 3, respectively. After each stimulation, patients were evaluated by the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS, from 0 to 10) for pain, spasm frequency and total score of bladder spasms symptoms. Data were collected at the same time points in control group and treatment group, i.e. 12, 36 and 60 h after surgery in the patient bedside.

### Intravenous lidocaine for the prevention of postoperative catheter-related bladder discomfort in male patients undergoing transurethral resection of bladder tumors: a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial [^8bc6e309]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Male patients undergoing transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBT) are prone to suffer from catheter-related bladder discomfort (CRBD). Lidocaine administration has been widely performed to reduce postoperative pain. Here, the effect of intravenous lidocaine administration on moderate-to-severe CRBD was evaluated in male patients undergoing TURBT.

Methods

Patients were randomly allocated to receive intravenous lidocaine (1.5 mg/kg bolus dose followed by a 2 mg/kg/h continuous infusion during the intraoperative period, which was continued for 1 hour postsurgery; group L) or placebo (normal saline; group C). The primary outcome was moderate-to-severe CRBD at 0 hour postsurgery (on admission to the postanesthetic care unit), analyzed using the χ test. The secondary outcome was opioid requirement during the 24-hour postoperative period. None, mild, and moderate-to-severe CRBD at 1, 2, and 6 hours postsurgery, postoperative pain, patient satisfaction, side effects of lidocaine and rescue medications (tramadol and fentanyl), and surgical complications were also assessed.

Results

A total of 132 patients were included in the study (66 patients in each group). The incidence of moderate-to-severe CRBD at 0 hour postsurgery was significantly lower in group L than in group C (25.8% vs 66.7%, P < .001, relative risk: 0.386, 95% confidence interval: 0.248–0.602). Opioid requirements during the 24-hour postoperative period were significantly lower in group L than in group C (10.0 mg [interquartile range (IQR), 5.0–15.0 mg] vs 13.8 mg [IQR, 10.0–20.0 mg], P = 0.005). At 1 and 2 hours postsurgery (but not at 6 hours), the incidence of moderate-to-severe CRBD was significantly lower in group L than in group C (1 hour: 10.6% vs 27.3%, P = 0.026; 2 hours: 0.0% vs 15.2%, P = 0.003). Patient satisfaction was significantly greater in group L than in group C (5.0 [IQR, 4.8–6.0] vs 4.0 [IQR, 4.0–5.0], P < .001). No lidocaine-related side effects were reported. Rescue medication-related side effects and surgical complications did not differ significantly between the 2 groups.

Conclusions

Intravenous lidocaine administration resulted in lower incidence of moderate-to-severe CRBD, lower opioid requirement, and higher patient satisfaction in male patients undergoing TURBT without evidence of significant side effects.

### Comparison of treatments for preventing lower urinary tract symptoms after BCG immunotherapy of bladder tumors: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^36c5f379]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Phenazopyridine showed the best performance in improving pelvic pain. Celecoxib and prulifloxacin also had good therapeutic effects. Phenazopyridine is an over-the-counter available urinary analgesic that provides symptomatic relief of pain caused by LUTS. It is now generally accepted that phenazopyridine has no significant bactericidal activity. Despite the long and extensive use of phenazopyridine, the mechanisms underlying its analgesic effects of phenazopyridine are largely elusive and its molecular targets in the LUTS remain unknown. TRPM8 inhibition may underlie the analgesic activity of phenazopyridine according to the latest research. Although long-term follow-up results are lacking, phenazopyridine, owing to its mechanism of action not involving antimicrobial activity, should theoretically not affect the antitumor effects of the BCG bladder instillation. As the efficacy of BCG is tied to the development of inflammation, and the LUTS side effects of BCG are sensory, directly targeting the peripheral ends of bladder-innervating sensory nerves without impacting the critical components of BCG-induced inflammation is an attractive target for preventing BCG-induced LUTS. Nevertheless, there is a significant shortage of precisely managed studies that have examined the specific targeting of sensory nerves innervating the bladder, which become hyperresponsive during BCG-induced LUTS. The most extensively studied related drug at present is phenazopyridine exactly.

### Transcutaneous electrical stimulation of somatic afferent nerves in the foot relieved symptoms related to postoperative bladder spasms [^bcba9c25]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Discussion

The management modalities for post operative bladder spasms include opioids, anticholinergic medication, bladder smooth muscle relaxants, sedation and anaesthesia. This study examined the effects of transcutaneous foot stimulation on patients with bladder spasms after prostate or bladder surgeries. It showed that foot stimulation could significantly reduce pain sensation and alleviate the symptoms of bladder spasms. These results provided preliminary evidence suggesting beneficial effects of stimulating somatic afferent nerves in the foot after bladder or prostate surgeries.

Previous studies showed that bladder and posterior urethral injuries associated with invasive procedures, postoperative catheterization, and bladder irrigation could induce involuntary contraction of detrusor muscle. In consistent with these reports bladder spasms were noticed in patients who underwent resection of the prostate or bladder lesions in our study. The mechanism underlying bladder spasm still remains unclear. It is well known that bladder mucosa, especially at the trigone is extremely sensitive to temperature, pressure and mechanical stimulation. A higher VAS score was found in patients after bladder surgery than those after prostate surgery (Table 2), suggesting that bladder surgeries may result in more irritation of the bladder mucosa and trigone than prostate surgeries. There was a similar distribution of the bladder and prostate patients in the control and treatment groups. Therefore, the surgical effects on bladder spasm should be comparable between the two groups.

### Efficacy of gabapentin for prevention of postoperative catheter-related bladder discomfort in patients undergoing transurethral resection of bladder tumor [^bda84be0]. Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the effect of 600 mg and 1200 mg oral gabapentin pretreatment for the prevention of postoperative catheter-related bladder discomfort (CRBD) in patients undergoing catheterization after transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT).

Materials and Methods

One hundred adult patients undergoing elective TURBT under spinal anesthesia were randomly allocated into 3 groups. Group I patients received placebo, group II patients received 600 mg gabapentin, and group III patients received 1200 mg gabapentin 1 hour before surgery. Lumber subarachnoid block was administered with 2.5 mL 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine. The patients were observed for the incidence and severity of CRBD in the postoperative period.

Results

The incidence of CRBD was 90% in group I, 66% in group II, and 26% in group III. The incidence of bladder discomfort was significantly low in group III at all time points compared with group I and at 4, 6, 12, and 24 hours compared with group II. The severity of CRBD was also less in group II and III patients compared with group I. Fifteen patients in group I developed moderate discomfort, whereas 1 patient in group II and none in group III. None of the patient receiving gabapentin had severe discomfort. The duration and level of sensory and motor block was comparable among groups. One patient in group II and 2 patients in group III were complained of dizziness in postoperative period.

Conclusion

Gabapentin 1200 mg administered before surgery is more effective than gabapentin 600 mg in decreasing the incidence of postoperative CRBD.

Conclusion

In summary, electrical foot stimulation could relieve the symptoms of bladder spasms and pain after BPH or bladder surgeries. Since foot stimulation is non-invasive, convenient for patients to use, and has no side effect, it could be considered as an additional modality for the control of postoperative bladder spasms and/or pain.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^b7bfb466]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU Guideline on Overactive Bladder — indwelling catheters advises: "Clinicians should only recommend chronic indwelling urethral or suprapubic catheters to patients with OAB when OAB therapies are contraindicated, ineffective, or no longer desired by the patient and always in the context of shared decision-making due to risk of harm. (Expert Opinion)". Before choosing this approach, "Before deciding on this form of bladder management, it is essential to counsel the patient on the potential long-term risk, benefits, and alternatives", since "Chronic indwelling urethral catheters can cause urethral trauma, including erosion and, in severe cases, urethral loss, significant urinary incontinence, and need for reconstructive surgery", and ongoing monitoring is emphasized: "Therefore, individuals opting for urethral catheterization should be counseled on the importance of regular follow-up to detect and address potential signs of urethral trauma". For leakage around a catheter, patients "should be made aware that increasing the catheter size or balloon volume is not the recommended solution" because "Such adjustments may potentially exacerbate damage to the urethra and its sphincters". Regarding device choice, "Suprapubic tubes (SPT) are the preferred chronic indwelling catheter option due to the reduced likelihood of urethral damage", although "SPT placement is associated with potential risks, such as bowel perforation or vascular injury" and "Some of this risk can be mitigated with routine use of ultrasound guided SPT placement", with other SPT complications including "development of granulation tissue, bleeding, catheter site erosion, and loss of access during catheter changes". The guideline lists complications common to both approaches: "catheter associated UTI, bladder calculi, catheter obstruction, bladder spasms, pain, diminished bladder capacity, and urine leakage". A retrospective cohort of long-term catheter users found "a significantly increased hazard ratio of 4.8 (95% CI: 4.26–5.42) for bladder cancer compared to matched controls", and bladder cancer specific death, "though rare (0.3% over a median of ~ 9 years), was 8–7 fold higher than controls", while "Long term use of both catheterization methods is associated with a small but increased risk of squamous cell bladder carcinoma that is thought to be secondary to chronic inflammation".

### How can we improve the diagnosis and management of bladder pain syndrome? Part 2: ICI-RS 2018 [^cc31d01b]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

This paper summarises the discussion in a think tank at the International Consultation on Incontinence-Research Society (ICI-RS) 2018 about the treatment of bladder pain syndrome.

Aims

To review the treatments of bladder pain syndrome from behavioural treatments to surgical interventions.

Materials and Methods

Review the literature in the light of the think tank discussions.

Results

All guidelines recommend different levels of treatment starting with conservative behavioral treatments then introducing oral treatments followed by intravesical instillations. If these treatments fail then more invasive treatments such as botulinum toxin injections, neuromodulation, or surgery could be suggested.

Conclusion

Unfortunately for all treatments, the numbers are limited and, therefore, the evidence base is not strong. Further suggestions for research are suggested.

Literature search

The initial literature search identified a total of 630 articles: 96 from PubMed, 245 from Web of Science, 189 from the Cochrane Library and 101 from EMBASE. After removing 278 duplicates, we identified 352 citations. Through screening the titles and abstracts for eligibility, we retrieved 41 articles for full-text assessment. Of these, 12 articles were excluded because of unavailable data, 12 articles were excluded because different outcomes were assessed and 7 articles were conference abstracts or editorial comments. The research process is shown in Fig. 1. Finally, 6 studies met our review inclusion criteria and remained for qualitative synthesis and quantitative meta-analysis.

### Comparative effectiveness of interventions for managing urological postoperative catheter-related bladder discomfort: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^92e8b0ee]. BMC Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Results

As shown in Fig. 1, 565 articles were initially screened. Next, 304 overlapping articles were eliminated, and 19 articles were kept after reading their titles and abstracts. Among these, 1 study was eliminated as it was impossible to obtain complete data, and 18 studies were finally included after carefully reading the full text.

Figure 3 shows the risk of bias assessment of included studies based on the Cochrane Risk bias assessment tool. All included studies were reported to be randomized. However, one of these studies did not describe the randomization procedure in enough detail to allow for assessment of risk of bias and thus was considered as having an unclear risk. Another study did not use the right randomization procedure, so it was assessed as having a high risk. Eight studies were evaluated as having a high or unclear risk of bias for blinding of outcomes as authors failed to describe the blinding method, or most outcomes were assessed by self-report scales, thus making them subjective. However, 4 studies were rated as having high risk as they did not provide data about the flow of participants over the study period or due to failure to explain the imbalance in participants between the two groups. Seven studies were rated as having an unclear risk of bias due to a lack of information on the prediction of outcomes at the protocol stage and a lack of clarification on whether they were primary or secondary outcomes. Also, there were no other risks of bias among included studies. The low risk of bias was defined at > 50% in six assessment domains.

Figure 4 shows the OR and 95%CI calculated by ADDIS for the analysis of the effect on the efficacy of the Bayesian model. Most interventions reduced the incidence of moderate to severe CRBD at 1 h after surgery to varying degrees, with nefopam having the most significant effect [OR:0.05 (0.01,0.22)]. Next, we ranked the comparative effectiveness of the interventions according to outcomes, which were calculated by using ADDIS (Figs. 5 and 6); Rank 16 showed the best results in both figures. Figures 5 and 6 also showed that Rank16, i.e. nefopam was the largest in included studies (0.48 and 0.22), thus suggesting it was the most effective in managing CRBD in terms of severity or reducing incidence.

Guideline Statement 24 — intravesical bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG): Intravesical instillation of bacillus Calmette-Guerin should not be offered outside of investigational study settings. Standard (Evidence Strength: Grade B). Efficacy has been only non-significantly greater than placebo with potentially significant adverse events (AEs), including in randomized controlled trials (RCTs): one RCT reported a non-significantly higher response rate in 15 BCG-treated vs 15 placebo-treated patients (60% versus 27%) at eight months with all patients reporting one or more AEs; a second larger RCT (131 BCG, 134 placebo) found no differences in response (21% vs 12%) at seven months with 95% in each group reporting at least one AE. Non-responders given open-label BCG had an 18% response rate at seven months, and among responders followed for 17 months, 86% of BCG vs 75% of placebo responders remained improved — a nonsignificant difference. Life-threatening AEs are possible with exposure to BCG, and the Panel judged that the risks/burdens of BCG outweigh its benefits; BCG administration in this patient group should be restricted to investigational settings.

### Transurethral resection of the prostate provides more favorable clinical outcomes compared with conservative medical treatment in patients with urinary retention caused by benign prostatic obstruction [^a23d2b9b]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

In men with BPH, risk factors for UR include advanced age, severe LUTSs, increased prostate volume, decreased urinary flow rate, and prostate-specific antigen level > 2.5. Three factors predominate the pathophysiological mechanisms of UR: outflow obstruction, neurological impairment, and an inefficient detrusor muscle, among which outflow obstruction is the most common cause. Another urodynamic study on UR reported that outflow obstruction may develop secondary to the interruption of sensory or motor nerve supply to the detrusor muscle, incomplete relaxation of the urinary sphincter mechanism, or inefficient contraction of the bladder detrusor muscle.

Once acute UR occurs, the initial management includes immediate decompression of the urinary bladder through urethral Foley catheterization or indwelling suprapubic cystostomy if urethral catheterization is not possible. Although UR is one of the absolute indicators for surgical treatment in patients with BPH/BPO, TURP is not the first choice of treatment in daily practice because of its potential risks and complications. Instead, α-blockers, which improve BPO in men with LUTSs, are regarded as the first-line treatment for BPO. α-Blockers can result in a successful trial without catheter (TWOC) in patients with acute UR. Some urologists offer a trial of voiding to patients with acute UR, and one study reported that patients voided successfully by 12 weeks after TWOC without surgical treatment. Another study reported that 48% of patients with acute UR had a successful TWOC when they were administered an α-blocker (Tamsulosin), whereas only 26% of patients had a successful trial when no drug was administered. Elsewhere, researchers indicated that after initial catheterization, 72.8% of men had a successful TWOC after a median of 3 days of catheterization, of which 79% had received an α1-blocker (Alfuzosin) before catheter removal.

### Radical transurethral resection in the management of muscle-invasive bladder cancer [^3f095be6]. Journal of Endourology (2001). Low credibility.

The morbidity of radical cystectomy and early reports of good results have stimulated interest in radical transurethral resection of bladder tumors (TURBT) for muscle-invasive transitional-cell carcinoma of the bladder. Various investigators have used surgery alone or with adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation. Further research is necessary to define the indications, but at present, radical TURBT for muscle-invasive cancer appears to be appropriate for patients too ill to undergo radical cystectomy, those who decline the open operation, and those enrolled in clinical trials of this approach to bladder cancer.

### Transcutaneous electrical stimulation of somatic afferent nerves in the foot relieved symptoms related to postoperative bladder spasms [^9686a82c]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative bladder spasms are involuntary movements of the detrusor muscle that can cause a sudden onset of pain in the region of bladder, a sensation of urgency to void, intermittent abdominal cramps, perineal pain, and/or urinary leakage around a urethral catheter after surgical procedures. The intermittent bladder pain is usually short, lasting 30 s or more with an interval about several minutes or hours. Bladder spasm is a common side effect of urological surgery; it could result in not only postoperative pain but also hemorrhage and therefore may prolong bladder recovery. Current treatment modalities include opioids, anticholinergic medication, bladder smooth muscle relaxants and sedation. However, bladder spasms still occur even though the patients are treated by these interventions.

Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation is a non-pharmacological and non-invasive method that delivers electrical pulses to the nerve via skin surface electrodes and widely used for pain relief. Recent studies indicate that transcutaneous stimulation of the foot can result in more than 50% increase in bladder capacity in healthy adults, and inhibit bladder detrusor overactivity in spinal cord-injured patients. Therefore, we hypothesize that transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the foot might partially or completely relieve the symptoms caused by postoperative bladder spasms. To test this hypothesis, this study examined the effects of electrical stimulation of the foot in patients who underwent surgical procedures for benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) or bladder diseases.

### Interventions for treating people with symptoms of bladder pain syndrome: a network meta-analysis [^ed6fe6d9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Bladder pain syndrome (BPS), which includes the condition of interstitial cystitis, is a poorly understood clinical condition for which patients present with varying symptoms. Management of BPS is challenging for both patients and practitioners. At present, there is no universally accepted diagnosis and diverse causes have been proposed. This is reflected in wide-ranging treatment options, used alone or in combination, with limited evidence. A network meta-analysis (NMA) simultaneously comparing multiple treatments may help to determine the best treatment options for patients with BPS.

Objectives

To conduct a network meta-analysis to assess the effects of interventions for treating people with symptoms of bladder pain syndrome (BPS).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, in the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and handsearched journals and conference proceedings (searched 11 May 2018) and the reference lists of relevant articles. We conducted a further search on 5 June 2019, which yielded four small studies that were screened for eligibility but were not incorporated into the review.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of interventions for treating adults with BPS. All types of interventions (including conservative, pharmacological and surgical) were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed the risk of bias of included studies using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool. Primary outcomes were the number of people cured or improved, pain, frequency and nocturia. For each outcome, random-effects NMA models were fitted using WinBUGS 1.4. We monitored median odds ratios (ORs) for binary outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes with 95% credible intervals (Crls). We compared results of the NMA with direct evidence from pairwise meta-analysis of head-to-head trials. We used the CINeMA tool to assess the certainty of evidence for selected treatment categories.

Main Results

We included 81 RCTs involving 4674 people with a median of 38 participants (range 10 to 369) per RCT. Most trials compared treatment against control; few trials compared two active treatments. There were 65 different active treatments, and some comparisons were informed by direct evidence from only one trial. To simplify, treatments were grouped into 31 treatment categories by mode of action. Most studies were judged to have unclear or high risk of bias for most domains, particularly for selection and detection bias. Overall, the NMA suggested that six (proportion cured/improved), one (pain), one (frequency) and zero (nocturia) treatment categories were effective compared with control, but there was great uncertainty around estimates of effect. Due to the large number of intervention comparisons in this review, we focus on three interventions: antidepressants, pentosan polysulfate (PPS) and neuromuscular blockade. We selected these interventions on the basis that they are given 'strong recommendations' in the EAU Guidelines for management of BPS (EAU Guidelines 2019). We found very low-certainty evidence suggesting that antidepressants were associated with greater likelihood of cure or improvement compared with control (OR 5.91, 95% CrI 1.12 to 37.56), but it was uncertain whether they reduced pain (MD -1.27, 95% CrI -3.25 to 0.71; low-certainty evidence), daytime frequency (MD -2.41, 95% CrI -6.85 to 2.05; very low-certainty evidence) or nocturia (MD 0.01, 95% CrI -2.53 to 2.50; very low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence that PPS had improved cure/improvement rates (OR 0.14, 95% CrI 0.40 to 3.35; very low-certainty evidence) or reduced pain (MD 0.42, 95% CrI -1.04 to 1.91; low-certainty evidence), frequency (MD -0.37, 95% CrI -5.00 to 3.44; very low-certainty evidence) or nocturia (MD -1.20, 95% CrI -3.62 to 1.28; very low-certainty evidence). There was evidence that neuromuscular blockade resulted in greater cure or improvement (OR 5.80, 95% CrI 2.08 to 18.30) but no evidence that it improved pain (MD -0.33, 95% CrI -1.71 to 1.03), frequency (MD -0.91, 95% CrI -3.24, 1.29) or nocturia (MD -0.04, 95% CrI -1.35 to 1.27). The certainty of this evidence was always very low.

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain whether some treatments may be effective in treating patients with BPS because the certainty of evidence was generally low or very low. Data were available for a relatively large number of trials, but most had small sample sizes and effects of treatments often could not be estimated with precision. An NMA was successfully conducted, but limited numbers of small trials for each treatment category hampered our ability to fully exploit the advantages of this analysis. Larger, more focused trials are needed to improve the current evidence base.

### Preventing catheter related bladder discomfort (CRBD… [^b1ff1680]. ClinicalTrials (2021). Medium credibility.

Irrigation attached with three-way large bore urinary catheters is employed in order to avoid this clot retention. 2 Catheter related bladder discomfort is a consequence of these large bore urinary catheters irritating the bladder mucosa causing involuntary bladder contractions being mediated by urothelial muscarinic receptors. 3 The incidence of CRBD ranges from 47% to 90%. 4 CRBD induced by indwelling urinary catheter is characterized by supra-pubic discomfort and a burning sensation in the urethra accompanied by an intense urge to void and increased urinary frequency. 5 CRBD doesn't respond to the orthodox opioid pain medication and is greatly distressful to the patients postoperatively, adversely affecting the quality of recovery often requiring administration of additional pain medication thereby increasing treatment costs, patient dissatisfaction and longer hospital stays. 3–5 The sensory supply of urethra and bladder neck is carried by Pudendal nerve.

It originates from the ventral rami of the anterior nerve roots arising from sacral segments S2 to S4. Therefore theoretically, CRBD can be prevented by applying Pudendal Nerve Block. 5 Xiaoqiang et al in 2017 reported that pudendal nerve block significantly reduced incidence of post-operative CRBD with administration of pudendal nerve block as compared to controls. Beyond that time there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups. 5 RATIONALE: The rationale of this study is that there is no previous study on this specific topic in the Pakistan. Thus, the findings of my study will help to determine the efficacy of pudendal nerve block in preventing CRBD in our population and will help improve evidence-based practices in patients undergoing TURP and TURBT.

OBJECTIVES: "To compare between spinal anesthesia with pudendal nerve block versus spinal anesthesia alone in terms of frequency of post-operative CRBD and its severity in patients undergoing TURP and TURBT" OPERATIONAL DEFINITIONS:
- CATHETER RELATED BLADDER DISCOMFORT CRBD will be defined as presence of supra-pubic discomfort and a burning sensation in the urethra accompanied by an intense urge to void. HYPOTHESIS: Spinal anesthesia and Pudendal Nerve Block are better than spinal anesthesia alone in preventing post-operative CRBD in patients undergoing TURP and TURBT. MATERIAL AND METHODS:
- **STUDY DESIGN**: Randomized controlled clinical trial.
- **SETTING**: Armed Forces Institute of Urology, Rawalpindi.
- **DURATION OF STUDY**: 6 Months after approval of synopsis.

### Dimethyl sulfoxide (Rimso-50) [^d0ea23be]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Instillation of 50 mL of RIMSO-50®(dimethyl sulfoxide) directly into the bladder may be accomplished by catheter or asepto syringe and allow to remain for 15 minutes. Application of an analgesic lubricant gel such as lidocaine jelly to the urethra is suggested prior to insertion of the catheter to avoid spasm. The medication is expelled by spontaneous voiding. It is recommended that the treatment be repeated every two weeks until maximum symptomatic relief is obtained. Thereafter, time intervals between therapy may be increased appropriately.

Administration of oral analgesic medication or suppositories containing belladonna and opium prior to the instillation of RIMSO-50®can reduce bladder spasm.

In patients with severe interstitial cystitis with very sensitive bladders, the initial treatment, and possibly the second and third (depending on patient response) should be done under anesthesia. (Saddle block has been suggested).

### NCCN guidelines® insights: bladder cancer, version 3.2024 [^12e38b6d]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2024). High credibility.

Bladder cancer — clinical presentation and initial evaluation indicate that the most common presenting symptom is microscopic or gross hematuria, with urinary frequency due to irritation or reduced bladder capacity also possible, and less commonly a urinary tract infection; patients presenting with these symptoms should be evaluated with office cystoscopy to determine if a lesion is present, and enhanced cystoscopy may be used if available; if a lesion is documented, the patient should be scheduled for a transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of disease within the bladder, and urine cytology may also be obtained around the time of cystoscopy; because smoking is a major risk factor for bladder cancer, screening for smoking and initiation of treatment for smoking cessation, if appropriate, is recommended during the initial evaluation; TURBT with a bimanual examination under anesthesia (EUA) is performed to resect visible tumor and to sample muscle within the area of the tumor to assess invasion.

### Drugs for treatment of urinary retention after surgery in adults [^db651129]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Post-operative urinary retention, the inability to void following surgery despite a full bladder, is usually transitory but can be prolonged in some cases. It can lead to several complications including urinary tract infection, long term bladder dysfunction and kidney damage leading to chronic kidney disease. Catheterisation, generally regarded as the optimal management method, is associated with risks and so pharmacological treatment of post-operative urinary retention that could remove or reduce the need for catheterisation is desirable.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of drugs for treatment of post-operative urinary retention either alone or as an adjunct to catheterisation.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register (searched 10 February 2010), CENTRAL (2010, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1950 to Week 1 January 2010), EMBASE (January 1980 to 2010 Week 5) and the reference lists of relevant articles.

Selection Criteria

Randomised and quasi randomised controlled trials in which at least one arm of the study included a drug treatment for post-operative urinary retention.

Data Collection and Analysis

Published reports of all potentially eligible studies were evaluated by two reviewers independently. No language or other limitations were applied. Standardised data extraction forms were used by two reviewers independently and cross-checked. Where insufficient data were reported authors were contacted where possible for further information. The risk of bias in eligible trials was assessed independently by two reviewers using the Cochrane risk of bias tool.

Main Results

Seven studies including 494 participants formed the evidence base for this review. Drug treatments assessed in studies in the review included cholinergic agents, alpha-blockers, sedatives and prostaglandin on their own or in combinations. No statistically significant associations were reported between successful treatment or any other outcome and cholinergic agents, alpha-blockers and sedatives as monotherapies. A statistically significant association between intravesically administered prostaglandin and successful voiding was detected, Risk Ratio 3.07 (95% CI 1.22 to 7.72). A statistically significant association was detected between cholinergic agents combined with sedative and an improved likelihood of spontaneous voiding compared with placebo, Risk Ratio 1.39 (95% CI 1.07 to 1.82). Significant heterogeneity was identified between the two studies in this analysis, however.

Authors' Conclusions

Whilst it may appear that cholinergic agents and intravesically administered prostaglandin offer most promise in the treatment of post-operative urinary retention, the evidence is weak. There is a need for further research into pharmacological alternatives to catheterisation in the treatment of this common surgical complication.

Muscle invasive urothelial bladder cancer — imaging limits and treatment after transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) are noted. CT scans, ultrasound, and MRI cannot accurately predict the true depth of invasion. The overwhelming majority of muscle invasive tumors are high-grade urothelial carcinomas. Further treatment following initial TURBT is often required for muscle invasive tumors, although select patients may be treated with TURBT alone. Available modalities include radical cystectomy, partial cystectomy, neoadjuvant or adjuvant therapy, bladder-preserving approaches, and systemic therapy for advanced disease.

### Do functional changes occur in the bladder due to bladder outlet obstruction?-ICI-RS 2018 [^56b35029]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2019). Medium credibility.

7 WHEN AND UNDER WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES IS THE RECOVERY OF THE BLADDER POSSIBLE AFTER TREATMENT OF BOO?

Several studies have evaluated the effects of pharmacologic treatment for BPO on BWT. Treatment with α‐blockers has been shown to significantly reduce BWT in various studies. 37, 38, 39 De Nunzio et al 40 evaluated the effect of dutasteride add‐on therapy in patients with 27 "BPH" already being treated with α‐blockers. 40 After 24 weeks of treatment, they observed a significant reduction in DWT. Unfortunately, no correlation with the results of pressure‐flow studies and DWT measurements have been reported.

Regarding BWT and surgery, one study evaluated 51 patients with "BPH" who underwent transurethral resection of the prostate: a very small but statistically significant reduction in DWT 1 month after surgery was found. Patients with larger prostates and a high degree of obstruction showed the greatest reduction. 41

Functional changes in the bladder due to bladder outlet obstruction may not revert to normal after treatment: Thomas et al 42 could not demonstrate any long‐term symptomatic or urodynamic gains from TURP in men with both BPO and detrusor underactivity. On the other hand, decompensation was rare in this relatively small and selected group of untreated BPO patients with DU. 42 In the majority of older men presenting with large volume chronic retention and acute on chronic retention, bladder contractility may be beyond recovery as shown by a study that followed 228 men who were catheterized after going into acute retention: The cumulative rate of recurrent retention was 56% after 1 week and 68% after 1 year. 43

### The effect of intraoperative dexmedetomidine on postoperative catheter-related bladder discomfort in patients undergoing transurethral bladder tumour resection: a double-blind randomised study [^219ade0d]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Catheter-related bladder discomfort (CRBD) due to an indwelling urinary catheter causes postoperative distress. Dexmedetomidine is used as an anaesthetic adjuvant during general anaesthesia and has an antimuscarinic effect, which may be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of CRBD.

Objective

To determine the effect of intraoperative dexmedetomidine administration on the incidence of CRBD.

Design

A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised study.

Setting

A tertiary care teaching hospital.

Patients

One-hundred and nine patients undergoing transurethral bladder tumour excision (TURB).

Interventions

Patients were randomly allocated to two groups: control group (n = 55) received placebo and dexmedetomidine group (n = 54) received intraoperative dexmedetomidine (1 μg kg(-1) loading dose followed by 0.5 μg kg(-1) h(-1) continuous infusion).

Main Outcome Measures

The incidence and severity (mild, moderate, severe) of CRBD assessed at 0, 1, 6 and 24 h postoperatively.

Results

The incidence of CRBD was significantly higher in the control group at 0 (78 vs. 50%; P = 0.004), 1 (86 vs. 57%; P = 0.002) and 6 h (82 vs. 63%; P = 0.047) postoperatively. The incidence of moderate to severe CRBD was higher in the control group at 0 (38 vs. 11%; P = 0.002) and 1 h (29 vs. 7%; P = 0.006) postoperatively. The number of patients having CRBD treated with tramadol was higher in the control group (24 vs. 12; P = 0.006). The mean end-tidal desflurane concentration during the surgery was higher in the control group (4.5 vs. 3.9%; P = 0.04). The postoperative pain score (numerical rating scale: 0 to 10) was higher in the control group at 0 (4.6 vs. 2.7; P = 0.002), and 1 h (3.8 vs. 2.7; P = 0.041). The number of patients treated with opioids was higher in the control group (21 vs. 8; P = 0.011).

Conclusion

Intraoperative dexmedetomidine administration decreased the incidence and severity of early postoperative CRBD as well as intraoperative desflurane and postoperative opioid requirements in patients undergoing TURB.

### Diagnosis and treatment of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer: AUA / SUO guideline [^0ffee171]. The Journal of Urology (2016). Medium credibility.

TURBT/repeat resection — Incomplete initial resection in NMIBC: In a patient with non-muscle invasive disease who underwent an incomplete initial resection, a clinician should perform repeat transurethral resection or endoscopic treatment of all remaining tumor if technically feasible (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Strength: Grade B). Incomplete resection is linked to early recurrences, with tumors noted at first follow-up cystoscopy in up to 45% of patients. The Panel notes rare situations where transurethral resection may be omitted for incompletely resected disease, including large-volume, high-grade tumors not amenable to complete endoscopic resection when immediate radical cystectomy is planned and tumors in a bladder diverticulum planned for subsequent surgical resection; however, for the majority of patients, complete resection is essential for adequate staging and optimal clinical management.

### Transcutaneous electrical stimulation of somatic afferent nerves in the foot relieved symptoms related to postoperative bladder spasms [^6c46d4aa]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Bladder spasm is a common side effect of urological surgery. Main treatment modalities include opioids or anticholinergic medication; however, bladder spasms still occur even after these interventions. Recent studies indicate that transcutaneous stimulation of the foot can result in 50% increase in bladder capacity in healthy adults, and inhibit bladder detrusor overactivity in spinal cord injured patients. In this study, we examined the effects of transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the foot on bladder spasms related symptoms.

Methods

Sixty-six male patients who underwent prostate or bladder surgeries due to benign prostatic hyperplasia or bladder diseases were randomly divided into two groups: the control group (n = 36) and the treatment group (n = 30). The control group received the routine postoperative care. The treatment group received daily transcutaneous electrical stimulation of the foot during 3 days after surgery; each time lasted for 60 min. All patients were evaluated by the Visual Analogue Scale for pain sensation, frequency of bladder spasm episodes, and a total score of bladder spasms symptoms.

Results

In the control group, the patients with bladder surgery had a higher Visual Analogue Scale score than patients with prostate surgery (P = 0.024). In both treatment and control groups, the Visual Analogue Scale score, spasm frequency, and total score of bladder spasm symptoms decreased from day 1 to day 3 (P < 0.001). The Visual Analogue Scale score at day 2, total score of bladder spasm symptoms at day 2 and day 3 were significantly lower in the treatment group than in the control group (P < 0.05).

Conclusion

These results provided preliminary evidence suggesting beneficial effects of stimulating somatic afferent nerves in the foot on postoperative bladder spasms.

Trial Registration

The study was registered with Chinese Clinical Trial Registry on June 13 2016 (http://www.chictr.org.cn/) (Identifier: ChiCTR-INR-16008635).

### Postoperative urinary retention [^63c17fb0]. Urogynecology (2023). High credibility.

Postoperative urinary retention (POUR) — medications affecting risk were addressed, with all 5 statements on medication effects reaching consensus in the first Delphi survey and Q3, Q4, and Q5 reaching 100% consensus; for Q4, the writing group agreed there was insufficient evidence to guide recommendations around discontinuation of preoperative overactive bladder medications to reduce POUR risk.

### Intravesical instillation of ropivacaine reduces bladder spasms following paediatric ureteroneocystostomy [^e8f8f918]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Bladder spasms are a common cause of pain after surgical procedures that call for postoperative catheter drainage. Several therapeutic methods have been used to lessen these spasms but none have received widespread success.

Patients and Methods

Twenty-six children were included in a prospective randomized trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of daily intravesical instillation of ropivacaine as prophylactic treatment for bladder spasms following ureteroneocystostomy.

Results

Although six patients experienced mild transient pain during instillation, there was no systemic toxicity attributable to the ropivacaine. The average number of spasms per day fell by half in the instillation group (p < 0.01).

Conclusion

Intravesical instillation of ropivacaine is a feasible alternative prophylactic treatment for postoperative bladder spasms.
