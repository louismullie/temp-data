## Question

Treatment of skin itching and swollen eye after antibiotics

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about evaluating and managing skin itching and a swollen eye that developed after antibiotic exposure. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate triage for life-threatening hypersensitivity. Then, I should verify the likely etiologies linking antibiotics to skin and ocular symptoms. Next, I will outline a focused history and examination to refine the differential. After that, I need to check which diagnostic tests are appropriate and when to escalate care. Finally, I will construct a management plan tailored to severity, including drug cessation, supportive care, pharmacologic therapy, and follow-up, while ensuring antibiotic stewardship and patient counseling throughout.

> Let me first confirm the immediate priorities: any signs of anaphylaxis, angioedema, or severe cutaneous adverse reactions require urgent action, so I need to screen for airway compromise, facial/oral swelling, dysphagia, dyspnea, mucosal erosions, dusky erythema, or rapidly progressive skin pain, because these suggest IgE-mediated anaphylaxis or severe delayed hypersensitivity such as SJS/TEN or DRESS, which are emergencies [^112Yepbz] [^114AJmxz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should verify the temporal relationship to antibiotic exposure and the specific agent, since macrolides, fluoroquinolones, rifampin, and tetracyclines have distinct hypersensitivity profiles and timelines, and azithromycin and other macrolides can rarely cause serious allergic reactions including angioedema and rash, while rifampin carries explicit warnings for rash with fever or blisters and ocular discoloration, and fluoroquinolones can provoke severe hypersensitivity including angioedema and urticaria [^116KgWur] [^114U3ACp] [^112aW2Sz] [^111mHYy8].

> Wait, let me verify the ocular differential; a swollen eye with itching after antibiotics could reflect allergic conjunctivitis, contact dermatitis of the eyelids from topical antibiotics or preservatives, or even a systemic drug reaction with periorbital edema, so I should distinguish allergic from infectious conjunctivitis by discharge character and laterality, and remember that topical antibiotics and preservatives can cause sensitization with pruritus, erythema, and edema of the lids and conjunctiva [^112Hw1t1] [^111tk3Pa] [^1168VaHE].

> I need to check the skin findings carefully; a pruritic rash without primary lesions suggests a drug eruption, whereas excoriations and lichenification point to chronic atopic dermatitis, and I should also consider whether the itch is histaminergic or nonhistaminergic because that influences antihistamine responsiveness and the need for anti-inflammatory therapy [^1127zdJz] [^113Pb6ks].

> Next, I should review the focused history: which antibiotic, dose, route, and exact start/stop dates; prior antibiotic exposures and reactions; atopy or allergic history; ocular symptoms such as discharge, photophobia, pain, or visual changes; systemic features like fever, malaise, mucosal involvement, or lymphadenopathy; and any concomitant new topical or systemic drugs, because these details shape pretest probabilities for IgE versus T-cell mediated reactions and ocular surface disease [^112Yepbz] [^114qm3HF] [^112Hw1t1].

> I will now examine the skin and eyes systematically; for the skin, I should look for urticaria, morbilliform exanthem, vesicles or bullae, dusky targets, mucosal erosions, and Nikolsky sign, and for the eyes, I should inspect the lids for edema and dermatitis, the conjunctiva for chemosis and papillary response, the cornea with fluorescein if indicated, and document visual acuity, because mucosal involvement, dusky erythema, or skin pain raise concern for SJS/TEN and warrant emergent dermatology/ophthalmology co-management [^112Yepbz] [^112Hw1t1].

> Let me consider diagnostics pragmatically; if the presentation is classic for mild drug eruption or allergic conjunctivitis, no labs may be needed, but if severe or systemic features are present, I should obtain CBC, LFTs, and BUN/creatinine to screen for organ involvement, and if SJS/TEN is suspected, I should arrange urgent dermatology input and consider biopsy; if a topical antibiotic is suspected as the culprit for eyelid dermatitis, I should confirm by discontinuation and consider patch testing if reactions recur or persist, and if ocular surface disease is suspected, I should consider targeted cultures or evaluation for demodicosis when refractory [^113paMho] [^112Yepbz] [^1172tBbJ] [^112Hw1t1] [^113bvhEx].

> I should double-check the management hierarchy; for any suspected drug hypersensitivity, the offending antibiotic must be stopped immediately and avoided thereafter, and for severe cutaneous adverse reactions, supportive care in a burn center or ICU setting, wound care, fluid/electrolyte management, and infection prophylaxis are standard, with topical antibiotics such as moxifloxacin used prophylactically on the ocular surface when there is corneal involvement or ulceration risk [^115PmRSG] [^115hk8Pj].

> For mild to moderate pruritic drug eruptions without mucosal involvement, I should provide symptomatic therapy with medium-potency topical corticosteroids to the skin and oral second-generation antihistamines, while avoiding topical antibiotics on the skin to prevent sensitization; if eyelid dermatitis is prominent, I should prefer low-allergenic ophthalmic corticosteroids such as dexamethasone for the shortest effective course and avoid neomycin or bacitracin on the lids due to high contact allergenicity [^111sn4st] [^112EiWPf] [^1172tBbJ] [^111tk3Pa].

> For ocular symptoms, let me verify supportive measures; preservative-free lubricating drops can reduce irritation, cold compresses can lessen edema and itch, and for significant allergic conjunctivitis symptoms, topical antihistamine drops can be considered; if there is concurrent eyelid eczema, treating the periocular skin with low-potency topical corticosteroid or calcineurin inhibitor can reduce rubbing and secondary ocular surface damage, but I need to ensure steroid-sparing strategies for chronic use [^11546XoX] [^114bu1QN] [^1172tBbJ].

> But wait, what if the ocular surface disease is refractory or recurrent; I should reconsider etiologies such as demodicosis, meibomian gland dysfunction, or preservative allergy, and tailor therapy accordingly, including lid hygiene, tea tree oil for Demodex when indicated, and preservative-free formulations to minimize toxicity, while monitoring closely for steroid-induced ocular hypertension if corticosteroids are used [^113bvhEx] [^115aBxUi] [^1168VaHE].

> I need to ensure antibiotic stewardship; if the original infection still requires treatment, I should select an alternative agent with a different structure class when possible, document the adverse reaction clearly, and counsel the patient to avoid the culprit drug in the future; for patients with nonanaphylactic macrolide or fluoroquinolone reactions, a supervised one-step or two-step oral challenge may be reasonable in select scenarios after risk–benefit assessment, but this should be guided by allergy expertise [^112aW2Sz].

> Next, I should review follow-up and safety netting; I will arrange reassessment within 24 to 48 hours to confirm trajectory, provide clear return precautions for worsening rash, mucosal involvement, visual changes, or respiratory symptoms, and coordinate dermatology and ophthalmology follow-up for severe reactions or persistent ocular surface disease, emphasizing strict avoidance of the implicated antibiotic and reinforcing hand hygiene if infectious conjunctivitis was in the differential to prevent spread [^116J3g7h].

> In summary, I should confirm severity and stop the culprit antibiotic immediately, treat mild reactions with topical corticosteroids and antihistamines while avoiding sensitizing topical antibiotics, escalate rapidly for severe cutaneous adverse reactions with supportive care and ocular prophylaxis, and tailor ocular therapy to allergic versus infectious etiologies with lubricants, antihistamine drops, and judicious periocular anti-inflammatory therapy, documenting the reaction and planning future antibiotic choices to prevent recurrence [^115PmRSG] [^115hk8Pj] [^112Hw1t1] [^112EiWPf].

Itching and eye swelling after antibiotics most often reflect a **drug allergy** or **contact dermatitis** [^notfound]. Stop the antibiotic immediately and start **oral antihistamines** (e.g. cetirizine 10 mg daily) for itch and swelling [^112EiWPf]. For the eye, use **cool compresses** and preservative-free lubricating drops; if itching is severe, add a topical antihistamine (e.g. ketotifen) [^11546XoX]. Apply a low-potency topical corticosteroid (e.g. hydrocortisone 1%) to the skin for 5–7 days [^112EiWPf]. If symptoms persist or worsen, or if there is respiratory distress, seek urgent care; for future antibiotic needs, document the reaction and consider allergy testing [^112aW2Sz].

---

## Clinical evaluation and diagnosis

### Differential diagnosis

- **Allergic reaction**: Urticaria, angioedema, or anaphylaxis to the antibiotic [^111mHYy8].

- **Contact dermatitis**: Localized skin reaction from topical antibiotics or preservatives [^1172tBbJ].

- **Drug-induced ocular surface disease**: Conjunctivitis, blepharitis, or periorbital edema from systemic or topical antibiotics [^115sfXJ9].

- **Delayed hypersensitivity reaction**: Maculopapular rash or DRESS [^117K4Xby].

---

### Diagnostic approach

- **History**: Timing, antibiotic type, route, prior reactions, atopy [^notfound].

- **Physical exam**: Skin lesions, ocular involvement, mucosal changes [^114qm3HF].

- **Testing**: Consider patch testing for contact dermatitis; skin prick or intradermal testing for IgE-mediated allergy [^1172tBbJ] [^115RNr7c].

---

## Immediate management

### General measures

Immediate actions include **stopping the antibiotic** and avoiding further exposure [^112aW2Sz]. Cool compresses can reduce periorbital swelling and itching, and a short course of oral antihistamines (e.g. cetirizine 10 mg daily) helps control pruritus and swelling [^112EiWPf].

---

### Topical treatments

- **Skin**: Low-potency topical corticosteroids (e.g. hydrocortisone 1%) for 5–7 days [^notfound].

- **Eyes**: Preservative-free lubricating drops; topical antihistamines (e.g. ketotifen) for severe itching [^11546XoX].

---

### Systemic treatments

Systemic options include **oral corticosteroids** (e.g. prednisone 0.5–1 mg/kg/day for 5–7 days) for moderate-to-severe reactions, and **epinephrine** for anaphylaxis (0.3–0.5 mg IM).

---

## Preventive measures and patient education

- **Documentation**: Record the antibiotic and reaction details [^notfound].

- **Allergy testing**: Consider for future antibiotic selection [^notfound].

- **Patient education**: Recognize early signs of allergic reactions and seek prompt care [^114U3ACp].

---

## When to seek medical attention

Seek immediate care for **severe reactions** — such as anaphylaxis, respiratory distress, or angioedema — and for **progressive symptoms** that worsen or persist despite initial therapy. Also seek care for ocular involvement with vision changes, pain, or persistent swelling [^111mHYy8] [^114bu1QN].

---

## Long-term management and follow-up

Long-term care includes **allergy consultation** to guide future antibiotic choices and consideration of desensitization if the antibiotic is essential [^116LBeSN]. Maintain regular follow-up to monitor for recurrence or chronic complications [^notfound].

---

Itching and eye swelling after antibiotics are most often due to allergy or contact dermatitis; **stop the drug**, use antihistamines, cool compresses, and topical corticosteroids, and seek care if symptoms persist or worsen.

### Rifampin [^114U3ACp]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Information for Patients

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs including rifampin should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When rifampin is prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed. Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by rifampin or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

The patient should be told that rifampin may produce a discoloration (yellow, orange, red, brown) of the teeth, urine, sweat, sputum, and tears, and the patient should be forewarned of this. Soft contact lenses may be permanently stained.

Rifampin is a well characterized and potent inducer of drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters and might therefore decrease or increase concomitant drug exposure and impact safety and efficacy (see DRUG INTERACTIONS). Therefore, patients should be advised not to take any other medication without medical advice.

The patient should be advised that the reliability of oral or other systemic hormonal contraceptives may be affected; consideration should be given to using alternative contraceptive measures.

Patients should be instructed to take rifampin either 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal with a full glass of water.

Patients should be instructed to notify their physician immediately if they experience any of the following: rash with fever or blisters, with or without peeling skin, itching, or swollen lymph nodes, loss of appetite, malaise, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, darkened urine, yellowish discoloration of the skin and eyes, light-colored bowel movements, fever, headache, fatigue, myalgias, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, wheezing and pain or swelling of the joints.

Patients should be advised to seek medical advice immediately if their symptoms of mycobacterial disease, including, but not limited to, cough, fever, tiredness, shortness of breath, malaise, headache, pain, night sweats, swollen lymph nodes, loss of appetite, weight loss, weakness, skin ulcers or lesions, worsen (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

Advise patients to abstain from alcohol, hepatotoxic medications or herbal products while taking rifampin.

Compliance with the full course of therapy must be emphasized, and the importance of not missing any doses must be stressed.

### A primer on topical antibiotics for the skin and eyes [^1168rh6A]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

A thorough knowledge of all topical antibiotics treatment options is important as more pathogens become resistant to standard therapies. As resistance to mupirocin increases, it seems that triple antibiotic ointments and retapamulin (the newest FDA-approved agent) will have greater roles in treating impetigo and skin infections. Awareness of all these agents provides a dermatologist additional tools with which to treat skin infections. As a wide variety of topical antibiotics, combination antibiotics, and combination anti-inflammatory preparations used by ophthalmologists are not part of the therapeutic armamentarium of most dermatologists, this review will provide the knowledge needed to rationally use such ophthalmologic preparations. Finally, information related to the topical nadifloxacin for acne and skin infections, which is in clinical use in Japan, is summarized.

Scenario 2: Infective Conjunctivitis

Conjunctivitis, an inflammation or infection of the mucous membrane covering the anterior sclera and inside eyelid, has 2 infectious forms, viral and bacterial, as well as a noninfectious form induced by allergens. Acute conjunctivitis is a relatively common ailment, with an estimated incidence reported in primary care settings of approximately 1.5% to 2% in the developed world. Although viral and bacterial conjunctivitis present with differentiating characteristics (eTable 4 in the Supplement), some studies suggest that pathogenic ambiguity can lead to misdiagnoses in as high as half of all cases, meaning that many patients receive inappropriate treatment. However, the unnecessary provision of antibiotics to individuals with the viral rather than the bacterial form of conjunctivitis adds to the development of antimicrobial resistance from overprescription of antibiotics. In reality, most conjunctivitis cases are self-limiting within 1 to 2 weeks of presentation, with minimal risk of long-term vision loss, a spontaneous remission rate that has led to increasing encouragement of a "delayed prescription" or "delayed antibiotic" approach.

Because in our scenario the visual signs and symptoms for viral and bacterial conjunctivitis precluded the SPs from requesting treatment for themselves, the SPs requested treatment for a family member or partner. For case 2A, when symptoms indicate bacterial conjunctivitis, the ideal management specified in the guidelines is prescription of a topical ocular antibiotic or, for mild cases, antiseptic eye drops (Table 2). Ocular lubricants or saline solutions will not treat the infection, although they can relieve some discomfort. Case 2B describes the presentation of viral conjunctivitis for which antiviral drugs are not recommended; rather, treatment is symptomatic and includes saline solution or an ocular lubricant. Diagnostic ambiguity is present because of conspecific symptom overlap between viral conjunctivitis and the most common type of noninfectious conjunctivitis, allergic conjunctivitis, whose incidence is very high. In the empirical analysis, we controlled for the contradistinctive symptoms of itchy or burning eyes and/or a history of allergies by asking the SP (posing as a family member or partner) the following diagnostic questions: "Do they have any allergies?" (with an answer of "No") and "Do they have any other symptoms?" (with an answer of "Yes, they had a cold about a week ago") (eTable 4 in the Supplement).

### Interventions for pityriasis rosea [^1141ZovC]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Pityriasis rosea is a scaly, itchy rash that mainly affects young adults and lasts for 2 to 12 weeks. The effects of many available treatments are uncertain. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2007.

Objectives

To assess the effects of interventions for the management of pityriasis rosea in any individual diagnosed by a medical practitioner.

Search Methods

We updated our searches of the following databases to October 2018: the Cochrane Skin Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We searched five trials registers. We also checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies, contacted trial authors, scanned the abstracts from major dermatology conference proceedings, and searched the CAB Abstracts database. We searched PubMed for adverse effects to November 2018.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials of interventions in pityriasis rosea. Treatment could be given in a single therapy or in combination. Eligible comparators were no treatment, placebo, vehicle only, another active compound, or placebo radiation treatment.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by the Cochrane. Our key outcomes were good or excellent rash improvement within two weeks, rated separately by the participant and medical practitioner; serious adverse events; resolution of itch within two weeks (participant-rated); reduction in itch score within two weeks (participant-rated); and minor participant-reported adverse events not requiring withdrawal of the treatment.

Main Results

We included 14 trials (761 participants). In general, risk of selection bias was unclear or low, but risk of performance bias and reporting bias was high for 21% of the studies. Participant age ranged from 2 to 60 years, and sex ratio was similar. Disease severity was measured by various severity indices, which the included studies did not categorise. Six studies were conducted in India, three in Iran, two in the Philippines, and one each in Pakistan, the United States, and China. The included studies were conducted in dermatology departments and a paediatric clinic. Study duration ranged from 5 to 26 months. Three studies were funded by drug manufacturers; most studies did not report their funding source. The included studies assessed macrolide antibiotics, an antiviral agent, phototherapy, steroids and antihistamine, and Chinese medicine. None of the studies measured participant-rated good or excellent rash improvement. All reported outcomes were assessed within two weeks of treatment, except for adverse effects, which were measured throughout treatment. There is probably no difference between oral clarithromycin and placebo in itch resolution (risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47 to 1.52; 1 study, 28 participants) or rash improvement (medical practitioner-rated) (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.44; 1 study, 60 participants). For this comparison, there were no serious adverse events (1 study, 60 participants); minor adverse events and reduction in itch score were not measured; and all evidence was of moderate quality. When compared with placebo, erythromycin may lead to increased rash improvement (medical practitioner-rated) (RR 4.02, 95% CI 0.28 to 56.61; 2 studies, 86 participants, low-quality evidence); however, the 95% CI indicates that the result may also be compatible with a benefit of placebo, and there may be little or no difference between treatments. Itch resolution was not measured, but one study measured reduction in itch score, which is probably larger with erythromycin (MD 3.95, 95% CI 3.37 to 4.53; 34 participants, moderate-quality evidence). In the same single, small trial, none of the participants had a serious adverse event, and there was no clear difference between groups in minor adverse events, which included gastrointestinal upset (RR 2.00, CI 0.20 to 20.04; moderate-quality evidence). Two trials compared oral azithromycin to placebo or vitamins. There is probably no difference between groups in itch resolution (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.48) or reduction in itch score (MD 0.04, 95% CI -0.35 to 0.43) (both outcomes based on one study; 70 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence from two studies indicates there may be no difference between groups in rash improvement (medical practitioner-rated) (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.00; 119 participants). In these same two studies, no serious adverse events were reported, and there was no clear difference between groups in minor adverse events, specifically mild abdominal pain (RR 5.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 47.10; moderate-quality evidence). Acyclovir was compared to placebo, vitamins, or no treatment in three trials (all moderate-quality evidence). Based on one trial (21 participants), itch resolution is probably higher with placebo than with acyclovir (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.94); reduction in itch score was not measured. However, there is probably a significant difference between groups in rash improvement (medical practitioner-rated) in favour of acyclovir versus all comparators (RR 2.45, 95% CI 1.33 to 4.53; 3 studies, 141 participants). Based on the same three studies, there were no serious adverse events in either group, and there was probably no difference between groups in minor adverse events (only one participant in the placebo group experienced abdominal pain and diarrhoea). One trial compared acyclovir added to standard care (calamine lotion and oral cetirizine) versus standard care alone (24 participants). The addition of acyclovir may lead to increased itch resolution (RR 4.50, 95% CI 1.22 to 16.62) and reduction in itch score (MD 1.26, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.78) compared to standard care alone. Rash improvement (medical practitioner-rated) was not measured. The trial reported no serious adverse events in either group, and there may be no difference between groups in minor adverse events, such as headache (RR 7.00, 95% CI 0.40 to 122.44) (all results based on low-quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

When compared with placebo or no treatment, oral acyclovir probably leads to increased good or excellent, medical practitioner-rated rash improvement. However, evidence for the effect of acyclovir on itch was inconclusive. We found low- to moderate-quality evidence that erythromycin probably reduces itch more than placebo. Small study sizes, heterogeneity, and bias in blinding and selective reporting limited our conclusions. Further research is needed to investigate different dose regimens of acyclovir and the effect of antivirals on pityriasis rosea.

### Neomycin, polymyxin b sulfates and hydrocortisone [^111tk3Pa]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

NOT FOR INJECTION INTO THE EYE. Neomycin and Polymyxin B Sulfates
and Hydrocortisone Ophthalmic Suspension should never be directly introduced
into the anterior chamber of the eye.

Prolonged use of corticosteroids may result in ocular hypertension and/or
glaucoma, with damage to the optic nerve, defects in visual acuity and fields of
vision, and posterior subcapsular cataract formation.

Prolonged use may suppress the host response and thus increase the hazard of
secondary ocular infections. In those diseases causing thinning of the cornea or
sclera, perforations have been known to occur with the use of topical
corticosteroids. In acute purulent conditions of the eye, corticosteroids may
mask infection or enhance existing infection.

If these products are used for 10 days or longer, intraocular pressure should
be routinely monitored even though it may be difficult in uncooperative
patients. Corticosteroids should be used with caution in the presence of
glaucoma.

The use of corticosteroids after cataract surgery may delay healing and
increase the incidence of filtering blebs.

Use of ocular corticosteroids may prolong the course and may exacerbate the
severity of many viral infections of the eye (including herpes simplex).
Employment of corticosteroid medication in the treatment of herpes simplex
requires great caution.

Topical antibiotics, particularly, neomycin sulfate, may cause cutaneous
sensitization. A precise incidence of hypersensitivity reactions (primarily skin
rash) due to topical antibiotics is not known. The manifestations of
sensitization to topical antibiotics are usually itching, reddening, and edema
of the conjunctiva and eyelid. A sensitization reaction may manifest simply as a
failure to heal. During long-term use of topical antibiotic products, periodic
examination for such signs is advisable, and the patient should be told to
discontinue the product if they are observed. Symptoms usually subside quickly
on withdrawing the medication. Application of products containing these
ingredients should be avoided for the patient thereafter (see PRECAUTIONS:

General).

### Tacrolimus (Protopic) [^112KWHFb]. FDA (2010). Low credibility.

What should I avoid while using PROTOPIC Ointment?

Do not use ultraviolet light therapy, sun lamps, or tanning beds during
treatment with PROTOPIC Ointment.
Limit sun exposure during treatment with PROTOPIC Ointment even when the
medicine is not on your skin. If you need to be outdoors after applying PROTOPIC
Ointment, wear loose fitting clothing that protects the treated area from the
sun. Ask your doctor what other types of protection from the sun you should
use.
Do not cover the skin being treated with bandages, dressings or wraps. You
can wear normal clothing.
Avoid getting PROTOPIC Ointment in the eyes or mouth. Do not swallow
PROTOPIC Ointment. If you do, call your doctor.

What are the possible side effects of PROTOPIC
Ointment?

Please read the first section of this Medication
Guide.

The most common side effects of PROTOPIC Ointment at
the skin application site are stinging, burning, or itching of the skin treated
with PROTOPIC. These side effects are usually mild to moderate, are most common
during the first few days of treatment, and usually go away as your skin
heals.

Other side effects include acne, swollen or infected
hair follicles, headache, increased sensitivity of the skin to hot or cold
temperatures, or flu-like symptoms such as the common cold and stuffy nose, skin
tingling, upset stomach, muscle pain, swollen glands (enlarged lymph nodes), or
skin infections including cold sores, chicken pox or shingles.

### A review of the differential diagnosis of acute infectious conjunctivitis: implications for treatment and management [^112Hw1t1]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Medium credibility.

Bacterial Conjunctivitis

Approximately 32% of acute infectious conjunctivitis cases are caused by bacteria, according to an evaluation of the prevalence of positive bacterial culture in adult patients who presented to their general practitioner with a red eye and either (muco)purulent discharge or glued eyelids. Bacterial conjunctivitis is typically unilateral but can sometimes affect both eyes. The staphylococcal species are the most common pathogens for bacterial conjunctivitis in adults, followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. In children, the bacterial disease is responsible for 50–75% of conjunctivitis cases, often caused by S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis. The hyperacute form of bacterial conjunctivitis is caused by either Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis.

Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is characterized by a rapid onset of conjunctival redness and mucopurulent discharge. Symptoms may also include burning and itching, though these are less common. Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is self-limiting, resolving within 7–10 days. Use of broad-spectrum topical antibiotics should be delayed, and no evidence demonstrates the superiority of any topical antibiotic agent. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) conjunctivitis is the cause of an estimated 3–64% of ocular staphylococcal infectionsand requires management by an ophthalmologist with antibiotics that are active against MRSA, such as besifloxacin ophthalmic suspension.

The rapid onset and progression of hyperacute bacterial conjunctivitis (often caused by N. gonorrhoeae) warrants immediate ophthalmic management to prevent corneal involvement and potentially perforation. Symptoms include purulent discharge, diminished visual acuity, eye tenderness, and swollen lymph nodes. The increasing incidence of gonorrhea infection was recognized in 2015 as an urgent public health threat in the United States. From 2013 to 2017 the rate of reported gonorrhea cases increased by 67% (555,608 cases in 2017), with an 18.6% increase between 2016 and 2017. Gonococcal ocular infection can present in neonates after vaginal delivery by infected mothers. Treatment includes intramuscular ceftriaxone for adults, children, and neonates, and oral azithromycin or doxycycline for adults. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention treatment guidelines changed in 2015 to support the use of dual therapy with ceftriaxone and azithromycin due to the increased resistance of N. gonorrhoeae to the antimicrobials previously used for treatment. Bacterial conjunctivitis lasting more than 4 weeks is considered chronic.

### Systemic side effects of eye drops: a pharmacokinetic perspective [^1168VaHE]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2016). Low credibility.

Drug classes

The following sheds some light on the possible adverse systemic side effects for some drug classes that are frequently prescribed.

Antibiotics

Bacterial inflammations of the eye are indeed much less common than other causes of inflammation but, when present, can often result in more serious diseases. Most ocular bacterial infections are treated with antibiotics, which may also cause systemic reactions. Some antibiotics have a wide therapeutic range; therefore, it is possible to administer these compounds systemically at high doses and thus they are used for treating the posterior regions of the eye which are normally difficult to access. Dermatological side effects, such as skin irritation, itching, or rashes, may be triggered by topical medications, eg, sulfonamide and sulfacetamide. It is also possible that fluoroquinolone can affect taste. Discontinuation of therapy is usually not necessary, but patients should be informed and warned about these probable side effects before starting or continuing treatment. The most popular aminoglycosides in use are tobramycin and gentamicin, which are often used in combination with a corticosteroid and have a wide spectrum of activity against bacteria, as well as neomycin, which is less frequently used. Local intolerances have been reported after the application of the aminoglycoside antibiotic neomycin such as the contact allergic reactions previously described.

Corticosteroids

Ophthalmic steroids are therapeutically used for allergic or noninfectious conjunctivitis, to inhibit inflammation following cataract surgery, and in the treatment of acute anterior and chronic posterior uveitis. Moreover, they are also used in the fields of immunosuppression following transplantation and in the acute management of giant cell arteritis. Monotherapy administration of steroid drugs has a limited role in the therapy of bacterial ocular infections. Unfortunately, this group of drugs is often misused, leading to more severe infections and, possibly, permanent ocular damage. This group of drugs, especially when given over a prolonged time as a local or systemic therapy, can increase intraocular pressure. Therefore, the use of such drugs should be monitored closely to prevent the emergence of a so-called "cortisone glaucoma". Intraocular pressure should always be monitored in eyes receiving periocular corticosteroids. Furthermore complications of periocular corticosteroids include ocular hypertension, cataract, ptosis, inadvertent rupture of the globe, systemic toxicity, and uncontrolled hyperglycemia.–

### Interventions for chronic blepharitis [^115aBxUi]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Blepharitis, an inflammatory condition associated with itchiness, redness, flaking, and crusting of the eyelids, is a common eye condition that affects both children and adults. It is common in all ethnic groups and across all ages. Although infrequent, blepharitis can lead to permanent alterations to the eyelid margin or vision loss from superficial keratopathy (abnormality of the cornea), corneal neovascularization, and ulceration. Most importantly, blepharitis frequently causes significant ocular symptoms such as burning sensation, irritation, tearing, and red eyes as well as visual problems such as photophobia and blurred vision. The exact etiopathogenesis is unknown, but suspected to be multifactorial, including chronic low-grade infections of the ocular surface with bacteria, infestations with certain parasites such as demodex, and inflammatory skin conditions such as atopy and seborrhea. Blepharitis can be categorized in several different ways. First, categorization is based on the length of disease process: acute or chronic blepharitis. Second, categorization is based on the anatomical location of disease: anterior, or front of the eye (e.g. staphylococcal and seborrheic blepharitis), and posterior, or back of the eye (e.g. meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD)). This review focuses on chronic blepharitis and stratifies anterior and posterior blepharitis.

Objectives

To examine the effectiveness of interventions in the treatment of chronic blepharitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 1), MEDLINE (January 1950 to February 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to February 2012), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We searched the reference lists of included studies for any additional studies not identified by the electronic searches. There were no date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. The electronic databases were last searched on 9 February 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-randomized controlled trials (CCTs) in which participants were adults aged 16 years or older and clinically diagnosed with chronic blepharitis. We also included trials where participants with chronic blepharitis were a subset of the participants included in the study and data were reported separately for these participants. Interventions within the scope of this review included medical treatment and lid hygiene measures.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed search results, reviewed full-text copies for eligibility, examined risk of bias, and extracted data. Data were meta-analyzed for studies comparing similar interventions and reporting comparable outcomes with the same timing. Otherwise, results for included studies were summarized in the text.

Main Results

There were 34 studies (2169 participants with blepharitis) included in this review: 20 studies (14 RCTs and 6 CCTs) included 1661 participants with anterior or mixed blepharitis and 14 studies (12 RCTs and 2 CCTs) included 508 participants with posterior blepharitis (MGD). Due to the heterogeneity of study characteristics among the included studies, with respect to follow-up periods and types of interventions, comparisons, and condition of participants, our ability to perform meta-analyses was limited. Topical antibiotics were shown to provide some symptomatic relief and were effective in eradicating bacteria from the eyelid margin for anterior blepharitis. Lid hygiene may provide symptomatic relief for anterior and posterior blepharitis. The effectiveness of other treatments for blepharitis, such as topical steroids and oral antibiotics, were inconclusive.

Authors' Conclusions

Despite identifying 34 trials related to treatments for blepharitis, there is no strong evidence for any of the treatments in terms of curing chronic blepharitis. Commercial products are marketed to consumers and prescribed to patients without substantial evidence of effectiveness. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of such treatments. Any RCT designed for this purpose should separate participants by type of condition (e.g. staphylococcal blepharitis or MGD) in order to minimize imbalances between groups (type I errors) and to achieve statistical power for analyses (prevent type II errors). Medical interventions and commercial products should be compared with conventional lid hygiene measures, such as warm compresses and eyelid margin washing, to determine effectiveness, as well as head-to-head to show comparative effectiveness between treatments. Outcomes of interest should be patient-centered and measured using validated questionnaires or scales. It is important that participants be followed long-term, at least one year, to assess chronic outcomes properly.

Conjunctivitis — common features and field care: Among fluorescein‑negative medical eye conditions, conjunctivitis, blepharitis, and ultraviolet keratitis can usually be treated in the field and are typically not serious, and conjunctivitis is the most common cause of a red eye. Common etiologies include allergies, viruses, and bacteria; conjunctivitis always involves the palpebral conjunctiva and the examiner must look under the lid to evaluate for this inflammation. The hallmark of allergic conjunctivitis is itching; bacterial conjunctivitis gives a purulent discharge whereas viral conjunctivitis tends to give a watery discharge. Treatment of allergic and viral conjunctivitis is primarily supportive, and bacterial conjunctivitis is treated with antibiotics.

### Safety of hydroxychloroquine: what a dermatologist should know [^114AJmxz]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Cutaneous rash and pruritus are the most common skin reactions in up to 10% of patients receiving HCQ. The typical presentations are maculopapular, erythematous, or urticarial rashes, usually occurring within 4 weeks of treatment. Sometimes pruritus may be presenting as isolated, unresponsive to antihistamine therapy. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) is an acute adverse skin reaction to drugs, characterized by the development of edema and erythema followed by the eruption of multiple punctiform, non-follicular, sterile pustules, predominantly in intertriginous areas, associated with fever and leukocytosis. AGEP has been rarely described in association with HCQ. It occurs rapidly and has prompt resolution within a few weeks. Sometimes AGEP and Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) may occur simultaneously (overlapping), with a potentially severe mucosal involvement. SJS and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are highly life-threatening adverse drug reactions characterized by the local detachment of the epidermis and mucous membranes, with possible involvement of internal organs. The main drugs implicated are allopurinol, carbamazepine, different antibiotics, and also HCQ. SJS and TEN typically occur when the average cumulative dose exceeds 100 mg. The condition starts with fever and flu-like symptoms lasting 1–3 days, followed by photophobia, conjunctival itching, dysphagia, and skin pain. It manifests with atypical targetoid skin lesions characterized by a central opaque or dark erythematous maculo-papular component, indicative of epidermal necrosis, which evolve into vesicles or blisters within 1–3 days, causing skin detachment. Involvement with intermediate extension is termed SJS/TEN overlap. In most cases, erosions of the mucous membranes (oropharynx, eyes, and genitals) usually appear a few days before the skin lesions. Supportive therapy is recommended for the treatment of SJS/TEN, which may include systemic corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins, cyclosporine, and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-α) antagonists. Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a severe T cell-mediated delayed-type adverse reaction. It presents with fever, diffuse morbilliform rash, facial edema, lymphadenopathy, organ involvement, and hematological abnormalities (eosinophilia and lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes). Human herpesvirus 6 reactivation plays a role in the pathogenesis of DRESS. The mortality rate is up to 10%. It represents a rare HCQ adverse event, with a delayed onset.

What should I avoid while using tacrolimus ointment?

Do not use ultraviolet light therapy, sun lamps, or tanning beds during treatment with tacrolimus ointment.
Limit sun exposure during treatment with tacrolimus ointment even when the medicine is not on your skin. If you need to be outdoors after applying tacrolimus ointment, wear loose fitting clothing that protects the treated area from the sun. Ask your doctor what other types of protection from the sun you should use.
Do not cover the skin being treated with bandages, dressings or wraps. You can wear normal clothing.
Avoid getting tacrolimus ointment in the eyes or mouth. Do not swallow tacrolimus ointment. If you do, call your doctor.

What are the possible side effects of tacrolimus ointment?

Please read the first section of this Medication Guide.

The most common side effects of tacrolimus ointment at the skin application site are stinging, burning, or itching of the skin treated with tacrolimus ointment. These side effects are usually mild to moderate, are most common during the first few days of treatment, and usually go away as your skin heals.

Other side effects include acne, swollen or infected hair follicles, headache, increased sensitivity of the skin to hot or cold temperatures, or flu-like symptoms such as the common cold and stuffy nose, skin tingling, upset stomach, muscle pain, swollen glands (enlarged lymph nodes), or skin infections including cold sores, chicken pox or shingles.

### Moxifloxacin hydrochloride (moxifloxacin) [^115QtXHh]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

- Hepatotoxicity: Inform patients that severe hepatotoxicity (including acute hepatitis and fatal events) has been reported in patients taking moxifloxacin. Instruct patients to inform their physician if they experience any signs or symptoms of liver injury including: loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, fever, weakness, tiredness, right upper quadrant tenderness, itching, yellowing of the skin and eyes, light colored bowel movements or dark colored urine.

- **Diarrhea**: Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, instruct patients to contact their physician as soon as possible.

- **Prolongation of the QT Interval**: Instruct patients to inform their physician of any personal or family history of QT prolongation or proarrhythmic conditions such as hypokalemia, bradycardia, or recent myocardial ischemia; if they are taking any Class IA (quinidine, procainamide), or Class III (amiodarone, sotalol) antiarrhythmic agents. Instruct patients to notify their physician if they have any symptoms of prolongation of the QT interval, including prolonged heart palpitations or a loss of consciousness.

### Minocycline hydrochloride (minolira extended release) [^112ZiWmf]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

What should I avoid during treatment with MINOLIRA?

Avoid sunlight or artificial sunlight, such as sunlamps or tanning beds. You could get severe sunburn. Use sunscreen and wear loose-fitting clothes that cover your skin while out in sunlight. Stop taking MINOLIRA if you get sunburn.
You should not drive or operate dangerous machinery until you know how MINOLIRA affects you. MINOLIRA may cause you to feel dizzy or lightheaded, or have a spinning feeling (vertigo).

What are possible side effects of MINOLIRA?

MINOLIRA may cause serious side effects, including:

Harm to an unborn baby. See "What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking MINOLIRA?"
Permanent teeth discoloration. MINOLIRA may permanently turn a baby or child's teeth yellow-gray-brown during tooth development. You should not use MINOLIRA during tooth development. Tooth development happens in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, and from birth to 8 years of age.
Slow bone growth. MINOLIRA may slow bone growth in infants and children. Slow bone growth is reversible after stopping treatment with MINOLIRA.
Diarrhea. Diarrhea can happen with most antibiotics, including MINOLIRA. This diarrhea may be caused by an infection (Clostridium difficile) in your intestines. Call your healthcare provider right away if you get watery or bloody stools.
Liver problems. MINOLIRA can cause liver problems that may lead to death. Stop taking MINOLIRA and call your healthcare provider right away if you get any of the following signs or symptoms of liver problems:
loss of appetite
tiredness
diarrhea
yellowing of your skin or the whites of your eyes
bleeding more easily than normal
confusion
sleepiness
Increased pressure around the brain (intracranial hypertension). This condition may lead to vision changes and permanent vision loss. You may be more likely to get intracranial hypertension if you are a female of childbearing potential and are overweight or have a history of intracranial hypertension. Stop taking MINOLIRA and tell your healthcare provider right away if you have blurred vision, double vision, vision loss, or headaches.
Immune system reactions including a lupus-like syndrome, hepatitis, and inflammation of blood or lymph vessels (vasculitis). Call your healthcare provider right away if you get a fever, rash, joint pain, or body weakness.
Serious skin or allergic reactions that may affect parts of your body such as your liver, lungs, kidneys and heart. Sometimes these can lead to death. Stop taking MINOLIRA and go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you have any of the following signs or symptoms:
skin rash, hives, sores in your mouth, or your skin blisters and peels
swelling of your face, eyes, lips, tongue, or throat
trouble swallowing or breathing
blood in your urine
fever, yellowing of the skin or the whites of your eyes, dark colored urine
pain on the right side of the stomach area (abdominal pain)
chest pain or abnormal heartbeats
swelling in your legs, ankles, and feet

### Slowly progressive chest rash in an elderly woman [^113oWHJJ]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Question 2: What is the recommended treatment?
A. Hydrocortisone cream
B. Systemic hormonal or chemotherapy
C. Surgical Excision
D. Photodynamic therapy
E. Antibiotics
Answers:
A. Hydrocortisone cream – Incorrect. Symptomatic treatment may include emollients and hydrocortisone cream to reduce itching, but this treatment does not address the etiology of the patient's symptoms.
B. Systemic hormonal or chemotherapy – Correct. Characteristics of the primary tumor or visceral metastases generally guide systemic treatment; however, there has been a report of ER − /PR − /Her2 − breast cancer that progressed to estrogen receptor–positive skin metastases. Two patients have been reported with resolution of skin metastases for more than a year after treatment with capecitabine.
C. Surgical excision – Incorrect. Carcinoma en cuirasse typically cannot be treated surgically because of difficulty achieving negative margins and involvement of large skin areas that would require extensive skin grafting. Of note, however, in one patient with ulcerating tumors of her breasts, treatment with antibiotics and palliative split-thickness skin grafts was successful: the grafts remained intact through subsequent courses of chemotherapy, showing that skin graft survival is possible with active neoplastic disease with sufficient vascularity.
D. Photodynamic therapy – Incorrect. A small study of photodynamic therapy for cutaneous metastasis showed best response in patients with minimal and nodular skin involvement.
E. Antibiotics – Incorrect. Carcinoma en cuirasse may mimic cellulitis or mastitis, which would be appropriately treated with antibiotics.

### Oral antibiotics for chronic blepharitis [^115MWGew]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Posterior blepharitis is common and causes ocular surface and lid damage as well as discomfort. It affects 37% to 47% of all ophthalmology patients; its incidence increasing with age. It is a multifactorial disease associated with multiple other pathologies, such as rosacea, meibomianitis, and infections. Treatment usually focuses on reliefing the symptoms by using artificial tears, lid scrubs, and warm compresses. The condition may be notoriously difficult to manage adequately once it becomes chronic. One such management approach for chronic blepharitis is the use of oral antibiotics for both their antibacterial as well as anti-inflammatory properties. There are currently no guidelines regarding the use of oral antibiotics, including antibiotic type, dosage, and treatment duration, for the treatment of chronic blepharitis.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of oral antibiotic use for people with chronic blepharitis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2020, Issue 8); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS); ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 29 August 2020.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing oral antibiotics with placebo in adult participants with chronic blepharitis (including staphylococcal, seborrhoeic, or Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD)).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodology and graded the certainty of the body of evidence for six outcomes using the GRADE classification.

Main Results

We included two studies with 220 participants (numbers of eyes unclear). One parallel-group RCT comparing oral doxycycline (40 mg once a day) with placebo enrolled 70 participants with blepharitis and facial rosacea in the United States. Follow-up duration was three months. One three-arm RCT conducted in South Korea investigated the effect of high-dose (200 mg twice a day) and low-dose (20 mg twice a day) doxycycline versus placebo after one month of study medication. It enrolled 50 participants with chronic MGD in each study arm (i.e. 150 participants enrolled in total). The two studies did not evaluate the same outcome measurements, which precluded any meta-analysis. The evidence for the effect of oral antibiotics on subjective improvement in symptoms was very uncertain. One study suggested that there was little to no effect of oral doxycycline on subjective symptoms based on the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) scores ranging from 0 to 100 (higher score indicates worse condition) (mean difference (MD) 3.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) -4.61 to 11.71; n = 70) and bulbar conjunctival hyperemia ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe) (MD -0.01, 95% CI -0.38 to 0.36; n = 70) at 12 weeks. The three-arm RCT showed that oral doxycycline may slightly improve number of symptoms (MD -0.56, 95% CI -0.95 to -0.17; n = 93 (high-dose doxycycline versus placebo); MD -0.48, 95% CI -0.86 to -0.10; n = 93 (low-dose doxycycline versus placebo)) and proportion of participants with symptom improvement (risk ratio (RR) 6.13, 95% CI 2.61 to 14.42; n = 93 (high-dose doxycycline versus placebo); RR 6.54, 95% CI 2.79 to 15.30; n = 93 (low-dose doxycycline versus placebo)) at one month, but the evidence is very uncertain. We judged the certainty of evidence for subjective symptoms as very low. One study evaluated aqueous tear production by Schirmer's test (mm/5 min) (higher score indicates better condition) and tear film stability by measuring tear film break-up time (TBUT) in seconds (higher score indicates better condition) at one month. We found very low certainty evidence that oral doxycycline may improve these clinical signs. The estimated MD in Schirmer's test score after one month of treatment was 4.09 mm (95% CI 2.38 to 5.80; n = 93) in the high-dose doxycycline group versus the placebo group and 3.76 mm (95% CI 1.85 to 5.67; n = 93) in the low-dose doxycycline group versus the placebo group. The estimated MD in TBUT after one month was 1.58 seconds (95% CI 0.57 to 2.59; n = 93) when comparing the high-dose doxycycline group with the placebo group, and 1.70 seconds (95% CI 0.96 to 2.44; n = 93) when comparing the low-dose doxycycline group with the placebo group. Although there was a noted improvement in these scores, their clinical importance remains uncertain. One study suggested that oral doxycycline may increase the incidence of serious side effects: 18 (39%) participants in the high-dose doxycycline group, 8 (17%) in the low-dose doxycycline group, and 3 (6%) out of 47 participants in the placebo group experienced serious side effects (RR 6.13, 95% CI 1.94 to 19.41; n = 93 (high-dose doxycycline versus placebo); RR 2.72, 95% CI 0.77 to 9.64; n = 93 (low-dose doxycycline versus placebo)). Additionally, one study reported that one case of migraine headache and five cases of headache were observed in the oral doxycycline group, and one case of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was observed in the placebo group. We judged the certainty of evidence for adverse events as very low.

Authors' Conclusions

There was insufficient evidence to draw any meaningful conclusions on the use of oral antibiotics for chronic blepharitis. Very low certainty evidence suggests that oral antibiotics may improve clinical signs, but may cause more adverse events. The evidence for the effect of oral antibiotics on subjective symptoms is very uncertain. Further trials are needed to provide high quality evidence on the use of oral antibiotics in the treatment of chronic blepharitis.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^111z9oYr]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Cutaneous anthrax — clinical features, diagnostics, and treatment evidence: After an incubation period of 1–12 days, pruritus begins at the entry site followed by a papule, vesicles develop on top of the papule, and finally a painless ulcer with a black scab; the eschar generally separates and sloughs after 12–14 days. Cultures of untreated lesions are positive > 80% of the time; white blood cell counts are generally normal and blood cultures are almost always negative. For specimen collection, vesicles should be unroofed and 2 dry swabs soaked in fluid, and at later stages 2 moist swabs rotated in the ulcer base or beneath the eschar's edge. No randomized, controlled trials of therapy exist; penicillin is effective and will "sterilize" most lesions within a few hours to 3 days without accelerating healing, with value primarily in reducing mortality from as high as 20% to zero. The optimal duration of treatment is uncertain, but 7–10 days appears adequate in naturally acquired cases, whereas Sixty days of treatment is recommended when associated with bioterrorism; until susceptibilities are available, ciprofloxacin is rational empiric therapy for bioterrorism-related cases, and other fluoroquinolones such as levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, or moxifloxacin are also likely to be effective.

### Contrasting experimental rodent aftercare with human clinical treatment for cervical spinal cord injury: bridging the translational "Valley of death" [^113SyYaL]. Journal of Neurotrauma (2023). Medium credibility.

Antibiotics

Prophylactic treatment with antibiotics is not indicated for acute SCI alone according to clinical standards of care. Prophylaxis is recommended, however, in cases wherein spinal surgery is necessary and when there is polytrauma involving open fractures or penetrating thoracic wounds. After experimentally induced SCI in mice and rats, some laboratories initiate prophylactic antibiotic therapy and others do not. Responsive antibiotic treatment of complications that arise after SCI in the clinical setting often include respiratory and UTIs, but after experimentally induced SCI in mice and rats, obvious signs of infection are unusual and subjects displaying any unusual medical complications in the post-operative stage are usually excluded from the study. As a result, implementation of responsive antibiotic therapy for post-SCI rats and mice would be unnecessary in most cases.

Because all experimental animals in SCI studies undergo surgery to induce their SCI, it could be argued that prophylactic antibiotic treatment is merited according to clinical standards. There is no homogenous protocol for the specific antibiotic combination utilized for post-surgical prophylaxis, however, because such details are highly dependent on local prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains and both patient allergies and comorbidities affecting drug metabolism and toxicity. Overall, clinical guidelines for infection treatment and prophylaxis after SCI result in a high degree of variation in patient exposure to antibiotics such that even patients in the same hospital might be treated with distinct medications and other persons with SCI receive no antibiotics at all.

As a result, we suggest no change in individual research groups' antibiotic treatment protocol with respect to infection prophylaxis. The heterogeneity of antibiotic type and exposure currently present in experimental studies of SCI already seems to reflect the clinical variation of antibiotic treatment in the human population. Regardless, it remains of great importance to report all post-injury drug treatment used in pre-clinical studies and to conduct replications of experiments evaluating therapeutic strategies across various profiles of antibiotic exposure to more robustly support translation of promising treatments to the clinic.

Dermatological care

As discussed briefly in the anticoagulation section above, mice and rats usually have greater mobility after SCI than do spontaneously injured humans. As a result, animals are much less prone to the development of pressure sores. Veterinary aftercare already includes frequent monitoring of skin integrity, specifically at the surgical site and areas such as the nares, eyes, and mouth prone to porphyrin staining. The clinical protocols dedicated to dermatological care primarily describe techniques to shift the weight-bearing skin surface and considerations to keep dependent areas clean and dry to avoid breakdown. At the current stage, we suggest no additional modifications to veterinary standards of skin care to reflect the clinical setting.

### A comparison of postprocedural wound care treatments: do antibiotic-based ointments improve outcomes? [^111kWRHF]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Topical antibiotic ointments are commonly used for the postprocedural treatment of superficial wounds created during dermatologic procedures. We propose that antibiotics may not be necessary for healing these wounds, have the potential to cause allergic contact dermatitis, and may contribute to the development of antibiotic resistance.

Objective

We sought to compare the efficacy and safety of a nonantibiotic, petrolatum-based ointment (Aquaphor Healing Ointment [AHO], Beiersdorf Inc, Wilton, CT) and an antibiotic-based first-aid ointment (Polysporin [Poly/Bac], Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ) for the treatment of wounds created by removal of seborrheic keratoses.

Methods

In this double-blind study, 30 subjects each had two seborrheic keratoses removed from their trunk or abdomen; one wound was treated with AHO and one with Poly/Bac twice daily. Clinical grading of wound healing and subjective irritation was assessed at days 7, 14, and 28 postwounding. Adverse events were recorded.

Results

Clinical grading assessment showed no differences between wounds treated with AHO versus Poly/Bac for erythema, edema, epithelial confluence, crusting, and scabbing at any time point. Subjective irritation assessment showed wounds treated with Poly/Bac had a significant increase in burning at week 1, whereas no differences were seen between treatments for stinging, itching, tightness, tingling, or pain. One case of allergic contact dermatitis was reported after Poly/Bac treatment.

Limitations

This was a relatively small study.

Conclusions

This study demonstrated that the petrolatum-based skin protectant ointment AHO provided equivalent efficacy for wound healing as a combination antibiotic first-aid ointment. Antibiotics may not be necessary to achieve satisfactory wound healing and may cause allergic contact dermatitis.

Bullous dermatoses — workup and evaluation includes "Dermatology consultation for consideration of skin biopsy and direct immunofluorescence. Further serologic workup, such as ELISA testing or indirect immunofluorescence, may be pursued". The section advises to "Rule out any other etiology of the skin problem, such as an infection, an effect of another drug, or a skin condition linked to another systemic disease", and provides a review-of-systems list for severe reactions, including "skin pain (like a sunburn), fevers, malaise, myalgias, arthralgias, abdominal pain, ocular discomfort or photophobia" and additional mucosal and genitourinary symptoms. It specifies, "Physical examination includes vital signs and a full skin examination specifically evaluating all skin surfaces and mucous membranes (eyes, nares, oropharynx, genitals, and perianal area). Assess for lymphadenopathy, and facial or distal-extremity swelling (may be signs of DIHS/DRESS; see 1.3 Section). Assess for pustules or blisters or erosions in addition to areas of dusky erythema, which may feel painful to palpation".

6 ADVERSE REACTIONS

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in one clinical trial of a drug cannot be directly compared with the rates in the clinical trials of the same or another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice.

The data described below reflect exposure to AzaSite in 698 patients. The population was between 1 and 87 years old with clinical signs and symptoms of bacterial conjunctivitis. The most frequently reported ocular adverse reaction reported in patients receiving AzaSite was eye irritation. This reaction occurred in approximately 1 to 2% of patients. Other adverse reactions associated with the use of AzaSite were reported in less than 1% of patients and included ocular reactions (blurred vision, burning, stinging and irritation upon instillation, contact dermatitis, corneal erosion, dry eye, eye pain, itching, ocular discharge, punctate keratitis, visual acuity reduction) and non-ocular reactions (dysgeusia, facial swelling, hives, nasal congestion, periocular swelling, rash, sinusitis, urticaria).

Most common adverse reaction reported in patients was eye irritation (1 to 2% of patients). (6)

### The future: critical knowledge about anti-itch therapy [^1114qEmJ]. Dermatologic Therapy (2005). Low credibility.

Itch is an extremely frequent and enervating symptom of many diseases. Current anti-itch therapy, which is based almost exclusively on an "immunocentric" viewpoint, is often unsatisfactory. Recent studies show that this symptom is in fact the result of a complex interplay among skin, nervous system, endocrine system, and immune system. This explains the frequent failure of therapeutic strategies focused only on a single factor and suggests the usefulness of a polypharmacologic symptomatic treatment, designed on a case-by-case basis as a result of a multidisciplinary approach. We discuss the perspectives of anti-itch therapy in light of the new pathogenetic and pharmacologic acquisitions.

### Misdiagnosis of scrub typhus complicated by hemophagocytic syndrome [^112rZBUj]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

To reduce the rate of misdiagnosis and achieve early and timely diagnosis of scrub typhus requires clinicians to fully understand the specific signs of the disease. The eschar is one of the most important clinical clue to diagnose scrub typhus. The eschar is often difficult to find because it is painless and not itching, and it is more likely to be found when searching the vicinity of swollen lymph nodes. The presence of an eschar was reported in 46–92% of the cases in South Korea, but in < 10% in Taiwan and in 17% in India. All nine patients included were initially misdiagnosed, and one of the reasons for misdiagnosis was that the eschar was not found. In all nine patients, the eschar was found in difficult-to-observe places after a careful examination by different pairs of eyes. It is therefore possible that the eschar was also missed in many patients in the previous studies. On the other hand, skin lesions located on humid sites such as the perineum and axilla manifest as ulcers, which are prone to misdiagnosis and negligence. Improving the vigilance of first-line clinical staffs is an effective way to improve the early diagnosis. Clinicians and nurses should receive training to perform repeated and detailed examinations and targeted laboratory tests for children with fever who are suspected of scrub typhus with multiple organ involvement. All nine patients in the present study were recorded as suspected scrub typhus shortly after admission. After careful and detailed examination of the entire body, even in hidden folds of the skin, the skin lesions were found and the diagnosis was corrected to scrub typhus. They then received effective treatment.

### Seven common allergen groups causing eyelid dermatitis: education and avoidance strategies [^1172tBbJ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2021). Medium credibility.

Eyelid ACD Management

Accurate identification and proper avoidance of problematic allergens offers the most straightforward, effective cure for eyelid ACD, as continued rubbing and itching can worsen symptoms. Patch testing is widely regarded as the ACD gold standard, but is not always readily available. Even without it, patients can be instructed to access free, online allergen avoidance programs to find safe products, such as SkinSAFE and the Contact Allergen Management Program (CAMP). Specifically, health care providers can enter the top seven allergen groups into CAMP (with ACDS member registration), or patients can browse SkinSAFE "EyelidSAFE" products, to choose products (both prescription and over-the-counter) free of these ACD triggers.

From an eye care provider's prescribing perspective, ophthalmic products can contain three common categories of allergens: preservatives, antibiotics, and topical steroids. Therefore, empiric common allergen avoidance therapy includes prescription of ophthalmic products 1) free of the preservative BAK; 2) free of aminoglycoside antibiotics (neomycin, gentamycin, tobramycin) and bacitracin; and 3) although less commonly a source for contact allergy, free of steroids such as prednisolone, loteprednol, and fluorometholone, with preference for dexamethasone or rimexolone. From a cutaneous therapy perspective, cold compresses, antihistamines, and topical corticosteroids (such as dexamethasone, given its low rate of allergy) can be employed to reduce patient discomfort and, in the case of topical corticosteroids, expedite resolution of acute inflammation. When using topical ophthalmic or cutaneous eyelid corticosteroids, the lowest-dose, shortest course is recommended, given the potential for steroid addiction and side effects. Long-term use can result in eyelid skin atrophy, cataracts, glaucoma, tachyphylaxis, or even flaring erythema, so eye examinations and intraocular pressure monitoring are needed. Local compounding pharmacies can make preservative-free dexamethasone and other ophthalmic medications to assist patients reacting to commercially prepared drops with BAK. If patients continue to flare upon tapering topical steroids, despite empiric top common allergen avoidance, chronic topical immunosuppressive options to be considered include steroid-sparing calcineurin inhibitors (eg tacrolimus and pimecrolimus) and the novel non-steroidal anti-inflammatory phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor crisaborole. For eyelids, tacrolimus is the calcineurin inhibitor of choice, as pimecrolimus is currently only available as a cream containing the moderately frequent contact allergen propylene glycol. Of note, crisaborole (Eucrisa) also contains propylene glycol. Additionally, if a patient requires chronic topical immunosuppression, patch testing should be considered.

### Delphi panel consensus regarding current clinical practice management options for… [^111swohR]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Blepharitis

Lid and ocular surface diseases often share a constellation of signs, including lid margin erythema, meibomian gland inspissation, conjunctivitis, conjunctival erythema, tear film instability, and keratitis. Blepharitis is a common inflammatory ocular disease that affects the eyelid margin, frequently resulting in disruption of the ocular surface and tear film. When present, blepharitis can damage the ocular surface and exacerbate concurrent ocular surface disorders. Because of its chronic nature and frequent comorbidity with other ocular surface diseases, managing these patients can be difficult. There are no FDA-approved treatments specifically for blepharitis, so the goal is often palliative, providing short-term management of signs and symptoms, with strategies such as warm compresses and lid hygiene, topical anti-inflammatory agents, and topical and oral antibiotics. While these options may temporarily relieve patient symptoms, they rarely address the root cause of the disease.

### The ASAM clinical practice guideline on alcohol withdrawal management [^113mn9zA]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Alcohol withdrawal — benzodiazepine selection, monitoring, and hepatic impairment guidance — states that "no particular benzodiazepine agent is more effective than another, longer-acting benzodiazepines are the preferred agents due to the clinical benefits of their longer duration of action". Clinicians "should monitor patients taking benzodiazepines for signs of over-sedation and respiratory depression", since "Longer-acting agents can accumulate and lead to over-sedation and respiratory depression, particularly in older patients or those with compromised health". In hepatic impairment, "Benzodiazepine accumulation is more likely in patients with impaired hepatic function", and "Medication dose can be reduced or a benzodiazepine with less dependence on hepatic metabolism can be used", but "the start of treatment should not be delayed while waiting for lab test(s) results or if the test(s) are unavailable at the time of presentation". When tests are unavailable and "a patient has signs of significant liver disease, use a benzodiazepine with less hepatic metabolization", with listed signs: "Skin and eyes that appear yellowish (jaundice)… Swelling in the legs and ankles (edema)… Itchy skin… Dark urine color… Pale stool color, or bloody or tar-colored stool… Confusion… Chronic fatigue… Nausea or vomiting". For agitation or confusion, "A reduction in the benzodiazepine dose and the addition of a neuroleptic agent… can be considered if patients are not at an elevated risk of seizure", noting "Some neuroleptic agents have been shown to reduce the seizure threshold".

### Systemic and topical antibiotics for chronic rhinosinusitis [^115NsxWK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

This review is one of six looking at the primary medical management options for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. Chronic rhinosinusitis is common and is characterised by inflammation of the lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses leading to nasal blockage, nasal discharge, facial pressure/pain and loss of sense of smell. The condition can occur with or without nasal polyps. Systemic and topical antibiotics are used with the aim of eliminating infection in the short term (and some to reduce inflammation in the long term), in order to normalise nasal mucus and improve symptoms.

Objectives

To assess the effects of systemic and topical antibiotics in people with chronic rhinosinusitis.

Search Methods

The Cochrane ENT Information Specialist searched the Cochrane ENT Trials Register; CENTRAL (2015, Issue 8); MEDLINE; EMBASE; ClinicalTrials.gov; ICTRP and additional sources for published and unpublished trials. The date of the search was 29 September 2015.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with a follow-up period of at least three months comparing systemic or topical antibiotic treatment to (a) placebo or (b) no treatment or (c) other pharmacological interventions.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Our primary outcomes were disease-specific health-related quality of life (HRQL), patient-reported disease severity and the commonest adverse event - gastrointestinal disturbance. Secondary outcomes included general HRQL, endoscopic nasal polyp score, computerised tomography (CT) scan score and the adverse events of suspected allergic reaction (rash or skin irritation) and anaphylaxis or other very serious reactions. We used GRADE to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome; this is indicated in italics.

Main Results

We included five RCTs (293 participants), all of which compared systemic antibiotics with placebo or another pharmacological intervention. The varying study characteristics made comparison difficult. Four studies recruited only adults and one only children. Three used macrolide, one tetracycline and one a cephalosporin-type antibiotic. Three recruited only patients with chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps, one recruited patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and one had a mixed population. Three followed up patients for 10 to 12 weeks after treatment had finished. Systemic antibiotics versus placebo Three studies compared antibiotics with placebo (176 participants). One study (64 participants, without polyps) reported disease-specific HRQL using the SNOT-20 (0 to 5, 0 = best quality of life). At the end of treatment (three months) the SNOT-20 score was lower in the group receiving macrolide antibiotics than the placebo group (mean difference (MD) -0.54 points, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.98 to -0.10), corresponding to a moderate effect size favouring antibiotics (moderate quality evidence). Three months after treatment, it is uncertain if there was a difference between groups. One study (33 participants, with polyps) provided information on gastrointestinal disturbances and suspected allergic reaction (rash or skin irritation) after a short course of tetracycline antibiotic compared with placebo. We are very uncertain if antibiotics were associated with an increase in gastrointestinal disturbances (risk ratio (RR) 1.36, 95% CI 0.22 to 8.50) or skin irritation (RR 6.67, 95% CI 0.34 to 128.86) (very low quality evidence). Systemic antibiotics plus saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroids versus placebo plus saline irrigation and intranasal corticosteroids One study (60 participants, some with and some without polyps) compared a three-month course of macrolide antibiotic with placebo; all participants also used saline irrigation and 70% used intranasal corticosteroids. Disease-specific HRQL was reported using SNOT-22 (0 to 110, 0 = best quality of life). Data were difficult to interpret (highly skewed and baseline imbalances) and it is unclear if there was an important difference at any time point (low quality evidence). To assess patient-reported disease severity participants rated the effect of treatment on a five-point scale (-2 for "desperately worse" to 2 for "cured") at the end of treatment (three months). For improvement in symptoms there was no difference between the antibiotics and placebo groups; the RR was 1.50 (95% CI 0.81 to 2.79; very low quality evidence), although there were also slightly more people who felt worse after treatment in the antibiotics group. There was no demonstrable difference in the rate of gastrointestinal disturbances between the groups (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.16 to 7.10). General HRQL was measured using the SF-36. The authors stated that there was no difference between groups at the end of treatment (12 weeks) or two weeks later. Systemic antibiotics versus intranasal corticosteroids One study (43 participants, without polyps) compared a three-month course of macrolide antibiotic with intranasal corticosteroids. Patient-reported disease severity was assessed using a composite symptom score (0 to 40; 0 = no symptoms). It is very uncertain if there was a difference as patient-reported disease severity was similar between groups (MD -0.32, 95% CI -2.11 to 1.47; low quality evidence). Systemic antibiotics versus oral corticosteroids One study (28 participants, with polyps) compared a short course of tetracycline antibiotic (unclear duration, ˜20 days) with a 20-day course of oral corticosteroids. We were unable to extract data on any of the primary efficacy outcomes. It is uncertain if there was a difference ingastrointestinal disturbances (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.16 to 6.14) or skin irritation (RR 2.00, 95% CI 0.20 to 19.62) as the results for these outcomes were similar between groups (very low quality evidence).

Authors' Conclusions

We found very little evidence that systemic antibiotics are effective in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. We did find moderate quality evidence of a modest improvement in disease-specific quality of life in adults with chronic rhinosinusitis without polyps receiving three months of a macrolide antibiotic. The size of improvement was moderate (0.5 points on a five-point scale) and only seen at the end of the three-month treatment; by three months later no difference was found. Despite a general understanding that antibiotics can be associated with adverse effects, including gastrointestinal disturbances, the results in this review were very uncertain because the studies were small and few events were reported. No RCTs of topical antibiotics met the inclusion criteria. More research in this area, particularly evaluating longer-term outcomes and adverse effects, is required.

### The HER2-directed antibody-drug conjugate DHES0815A in advanced and / or metastatic breast cancer: preclinical characterization and phase 1 trial results [^1154z9Tb]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

All 14 patients were safety evaluable, and all experienced at least one treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE). Summaries of AEs are provided in Table 1. No DLT (dose-limiting toxicity) criteria were met during dose escalation for any cohort and the MTD was not reached. However, the onset of several dermatologic, ocular, and pulmonary adverse events presented in later cycles beyond the DLT window, limiting further dose escalation and eventually resulted in halting enrollment.

Table 1
Adverse events occurring in20% of patients regardless of attribution

Adverse events related to study drug by highest NCI CTCAE grade; safety-evaluable patients.

TEAEs reported in ≥ 20% of patients are shown in Table 1. Eleven patients (79%) experienced AEs considered related to DHES0815A; the most frequently reported (n ≥ 3 patients) included pruritus and rash (n = 5 each, 36%), fatigue (n = 4, 29%), skin hyperpigmentation, photophobia, and nausea (n = 3 each, 21%). Following three or more cycles at 4 and two or more cycles at 6 mg/kg, multiple safety events involving skin, eyes and lung emerged, often concurrently in a given patient; these events led to treatment discontinuation in all 5 patients treated at these doses. Dermatologic toxicities included pruritus, rash, and skin hyperpigmentation, and were managed with topical and oral antihistamines and corticosteroids. Ocular toxicities included photophobia, conjunctivitis, blepharitis, dry eye, eyelid/periorbital edema, punctate keratitis and eye pain. These toxicities manifested with clinical symptoms and were not identified with routine ophthalmic examinations that were required as part of the study. Management included antibiotics, ophthalmic lubricants, steroids, analgesics, topical anesthetics and other agents. Pneumonitis was reported in 2 patients dosed at or above 4 mg/kg and CT findings of ground glass opacities were reported for both patients. Management included systemic steroids. Due to the small number of patients, it was not clear if any medical intervention for the skin, eye, and lung toxicities improved the severity or duration of symptoms; all 5 patients had unresolved sequelae from some of these toxicities at the time of discontinuation from study follow-up. Supplementary Fig. 15 depicts rash and pulmonary findings and outlines the time course of AEs in a patient who was treated at 4.0 mg/kg for 3 cycles. Two patients assigned to lower doses (0.6 mg/kg and 1.2 mg/kg doses) received a higher cumulative dose compared to any patient enrolled at doses of ≥ 4.0 mg/kg over the course of 1.4 years and 2.6 years, respectively. At the time treatment was discontinued for these patients, one patient had developed rash and periorbital edema and the other had developed rash and skin hyperpigmentation. While patient numbers are limited, the higher cumulative doses tolerated by these two patients compared to the patients at doses of ≥ 4.0 mg/kg suggests that safety events are not only related to cumulative exposure but likely also related to the maximum dose administered in a single infusion.

### A phase III clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of combined azithromycin and dexamethasone in the treatment of blepharoconjunctivitis [^1179MSRJ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Blepharoconjunctivitis is characterized by inflammation of the outer eyelids and the conjunctiva that results in redness and swelling. It is associated with increased bacterial colonization, especially with Staphylococcus species. It is diagnosed when there is simultaneous occurrence of blepharitis and conjunctivitis, and there are both inflammatory and bacterial components to the disorder.–If left untreated, blepharoconjunctivitis may lead to scarring of the eyelid and loss of proper eyelid function over time with secondary damage to the ocular surface. Several subtypes of blepharoconjunctivitis have been identified, including anterior disease, posterior disease (similar to blepharitis), angular blepharoconjunctivitis, seborrheic blepharoconjunctivitis, and atopic blepharoconjunctivitis, and different subtypes may require different treatment strategies. In atopic blepharoconjunctivitis, for example, an allergic component may be treated successfully with steroids, while a bacterial load would necessitate both antibiotics and steroids for an optimal and quick resolution.

Blepharoconjunctivitis commonly presents as diffuse inflammation of both the anterior and posterior lid margins as well as the conjunctiva and is usually associated with an increase in the local bacterial load. Discharge secondary to blepharoconjunctivitis is not uncommon, and may result in patients reporting eye dryness with eyelids stuck shut in the morning and the presence of greasy and/or crusty eyelashes. Although blepharoconjunctivitis is more common among individuals of middle age or older, it also has been reported in childhood.

In its chronic form, acute onset blepharoconjunctivitis can lead to lid ulceration that results in malposition of tear duct and/or corneal sequelae. Although viral or bacterial microorganisms may cause blepharoconjunctivitis, toxins produced by the Staphylococcal spp. (in particular Staphylococcus epidermis and aureus) have been implicated as a major cause of blepharoconjunctivitis. In general, S. epidermis and S. aureus are found in both the staphylococcal and mixed seborrheic-staphylococcal manifestations. Other organisms found when culturing the lids and conjunctiva in patients with blepharitis include Propionibacterium acnes and Corynebacteria.–

### Widespread rash in a 45-year-old woman after moxifloxacin administration [^113Cvq12]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the first step in the management of this patient's condition?
A. Discontinuation of moxifloxacin
B. Initiation of systemic corticosteroids
C. Administration of intravenous immunoglobulin
D. Application of topical antibiotics
E. Referral to a dermatologist

Answers:

A. Discontinuation of moxifloxacin – Correct. The first step in managing the patient's condition is to discontinue moxifloxacin. In cases of TEN, it is essential to discontinue the culprit drug immediately to prevent further progression of the condition. This step is crucial because continuation of the drug may exacerbate immune-mediated destruction of keratinocytes, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality.
B. Initiation of systemic corticosteroids – Incorrect. Systemic corticosteroids may be considered, but they are not the initial step. The primary goal is to remove the trigger, which in this case is moxifloxacin, to stop the adverse reaction.
C. Administration of intravenous immunoglobulin – Incorrect. Also, intravenous immunoglobulins and other immunomodulatory treatments may be considered, but the primary goal is to stop moxifloxacin.
D. Application of topical antibiotics – Incorrect. The application of topical antibiotics is not relevant to the systemic nature of the TEN and does not address the underlying cause.
E. Referral to a dermatologist – Incorrect. Referral to a dermatologist is important for complete treatment but should follow immediate discontinuation of the drug.

### Treatment of ocular itching associated with ocular demodicosis by 5% tea tree oil ointment [^113bvhEx]. Cornea (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine whether ocular itching associated with ocular demodicosis can be treated by lid massage with 5% tea tree oil ointment (TTOO).

Methods

Twenty-four patients with ocular itching and ocular Demodex were treated with chlortetracycline hydrochloride eye ointment lid massage for 4 weeks and then treatment was switched to TTOO for another 4 weeks. They were examined every 2 weeks and their itching was graded as 0 (none), 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), or 3 (severe). Changes of itching scores and Demodex counts were compared.

Results

Before the treatment, all 24 patients reported itching graded as 1 (n = 3), 2 (n = 15), and 3 (n = 6) for a period of 2 weeks to 2 years despite previous topical antibiotics, antiinflammatory medications, or antiallergy medications. Demodex counts per 8 epilated lashes were 5.5 ± 1.6 for all patients but 4.6 ± 1.5, 4.8 ± 1.9, and 7.1 ± 2.1 for patients with grade 1, grade 2, and grade 3 itchiness, respectively (P < 0.05 between grade 2 and grade 3). After 4 weeks of chlortetracycline hydrochloride eye ointment treatment, little changes were observed regarding itching and Demodex counts in all patients (P > 0.05). In contrast, after 5% TTOO treatment, 16 patients were totally free of itching and the remaining 8 patients had different degrees of relief (P < 0.01). The Demodex count decreased to 0.7 ± 0.8 for total (P < 0.01).

Conclusions

There is a strong correlation between ocular itching and Demodex infestation and between symptomatic resolution and reduction of Demodex counts by daily lid massage with 5% TTOO.

### Strategies for using topical corticosteroids in children and adults with eczema [^1127zdJz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Clinical features

Eczema may be acute (short and severe) with weeping vesicles on red, swollen skin, or it may be chronic (long‐term) with inflammation, lichenification (thickening of the skin caused by repeated rubbing or scratching), excoriation (abrasion because of rubbing or scratching), hyperpigmentation, and exaggerated surface markings (Weidinger 2016). The typical distribution and type of lesions vary during different stages of life and between different ethnicities. In infants, the extremities and face are usually affected. By around two years of age, lesions mainly appear on the limbs, particularly in the creases of the elbows and knees, as well as the neck, wrists, and ankles. In adulthood, the lesions can become more widespread than those seen in childhood (Bieber 2008a).

The severity of eczema can vary enormously, ranging from dry skin with the occasional itchy inflamed patch, to involvement of the whole body with secondary infections. The course of eczema may also vary from a relapsing‐remitting one affecting a few areas recurrently to a continuous one with prolonged periods of inflamed skin covering most of the body (Berke 2012). Itching can induce a vicious cycle of scratching, leading to skin damage, which in turn causes itchiness — often referred to as the 'itch‐scratch cycle' (Pavlis 2017).

Treatment of eczema

There is currently no cure for eczema, so the treatment goal is control of the disease using the wide range of treatments available including emollients (NICE 2007; SIGN 2011). First‐line therapy is the daily application of emollients combined with anti‐inflammatory therapy. The most commonly used anti‐inflammatory therapy is topical corticosteroids, but topical calcineurin inhibitors are also used. These can be combined with bandages and phototherapy for those who do not respond sufficiently to topical treatment alone. Severe eczema may require systemic treatments such as oral ciclosporin, methotrexate or azathioprine. New biologic agents such as dupilumab are now available for cases of eczema that do not respond to other systemic treatments (Snast 2018). Although topical corticosteroids have been the mainstay of eczema treatment for over 60 years, there are still many unanswered questions about how best to use them (Batchelor 2013).

### Comparison of repeated doses of ivermectin versus ivermectin plus albendazole for the treatment of onchocerciasis: a randomized, open-label, clinical trial [^116Gk7nV]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

The proportion of individuals that completely cleared MF at 36 months were 63% in the IVM annual, 71% in the IVM semiannual, 61% in the IVM+ALB annual, and 81% in the IVM+ALB semiannual group. The addition of ALB did not improve or sustain MF clearance. However, the semiannual drug administration resulted in superior sustained MF clearance (annual 62%; semiannual 76%; p = 0.024). This result was confirmed by the multivariable analysis, where, in addition to the baseline MF/mg skin counts (P = 0.011), semiannual drug administration was significantly associated with the sustained clearance of MF (P = 0.029). A similar trend was seen in the PP analysis (MF/mg skin at baseline P = 0.006; annual/semiannual P = 0.064).

Adverse Events

A total of 617 adverse events were reported during the 5 treatment rounds; 415 (67.3%) of these occurred after the first treatment, with no differences between the 4 treatment groups. The adverse events included cutaneous itching (31.4%), different types of pain (14.1%), swollen limbs (10.4%), headache (8.8%), cutaneous rash (6.3%), fever (6%), swollen face (2%), and other conditions, such as nausea, dizziness, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, and ocular reactions (n = 7; blurred vision ± itching painful eyes, all resolved without any residues). During the conduct of the study, 6 study participants died. None of the deaths were related to the study drugs (IVM annual n = 1, IVM semiannual n = 3; IVM+ALB semiannual n = 2) and all deaths happened 7–10 months after the patients received their last verum treatment. No other serious adverse events were observed (Table 5; Supplementary Table 7).

Conjunctivitis (pink eye) — facility entry and precautions are severity based and emphasize hygiene: "Individuals who have conjunctivitis should be considered contagious until their symptoms have resolved". "Restrict individuals with severe conjunctivitis (i.e., copious eye discharge, eye irritation causing frequent eye rubbing or itching, or conjunctivitis accompanied by fever or respiratory symptoms) from entering the family-centered residential facility". "Allow individuals with mild conjunctivitis ("pink eye" with no active discharge, minimum eye irritation, and no fever) to enter the facility, but require such guests to stay in their personal room until their symptoms have resolved". "Allow individuals who were exposed to a person with conjunctivitis but who do not have symptoms of illness to enter the facility. No special precautions are required". Provide education: "frequent hand hygiene, avoidance of sharing personal items (e.g., towels and washcloths, eye drops, and contact lens solutions), and prompt removal and careful handling of contaminated items (e.g., tissues, towels, and linens)". Clinically, "Conjunctivitis does not necessarily require treatment with topical or oral antibiotics".

### Ocular hypersensitivitiy to topical vancomycin in a case of chronic endophthalmitis [^113c5mJW]. Cornea (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

To report a case of ocular allergy to topical vancomycin eye drops.

Methods

Interventional case report.

Results

A 76-year-old man presented with progressive itching, soreness, and burning sensations, photophobia, and tearing in his left eye 3 days after completing 2 weeks of treatment with 5% vancomycin eye drops. He had been suffering for the previous 2 years from chronic recurrent endophthalmitis and secondary glaucoma associated with cataract surgery in his left eye. He denied any history of drug or food allergy. Examination by slit-lamp microscope showed left periorbital skin erosive rash, marked hyperemia of conjunctiva, central epithelial defect, corneal stromal edema, and Descemet membrane striae. Vancomycin skin tests were positive. The patient's symptoms resolved after discontinuing vancomycin eye drops and responded well to systemic corticosteroids, antihistamines, and topical corticosteroid treatments. Teicoplanin treated his endophthalmitis successfully.

Conclusion

A case of hypersensitivity to topical vancamycin was reported. Patients who receive topical vancomycin should be informed of this possible adverse effect and instructed to contact their ophthalmologists if allergic reactions occur.

### The role of the microbiome and microbiome-derived metabolites in atopic dermatitis and non-histaminergic itch [^113Pb6ks]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis by Modification of the Microbiome

There are many ways in which we can intervene in AD by modification of the microbiome, including using prebiotics (small molecules that regulate the bacteria), probiotics (live bacteria that regulate host responses), postbiotics (metabolites from bacteria), and antibiotics (AMPs from commensal bacteria). Although previous treatments have concentrated primarily on the use of probiotics, future therapeutic interventions involving postbiotics may prove to be safer and provide more easily commercialized new-generation treatments for AD and other atopic skin diseases. However, further understanding of the mechanism of action of skin metabolites in inflammation is needed to enable these molecules to be used effectively in future treatments. In addition, treatments for chronic itch in AD could involve treatments targeted toward reducing the activation of proteases or toward receptors and ligands involved in the interaction between microbes and the peripheral nerve system to minimize activation of the non-histaminergic pathway.

### Antibiotics versus placebo for acute bacterial conjunctivitis [^116vUc9B]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Acute bacterial conjunctivitis is an infection of the conjunctiva. Both the palpebral and the bulbar ocular conjunctival surfaces are usually affected and typically become red and inflamed. Antibiotic therapy is widely used for the treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. This Cochrane Review was first published in The Cochrane Library in 1999; updated in 2006 and again in 2012.

Objectives

To assess the benefits and harms of antibiotic therapy in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (The Cochrane Library 2012, Issue 7), MEDLINE (January 1950 to July 2012), EMBASE (January 1980 to July 2012), OpenGrey (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) (www.opengrey.eu/), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 18 July 2012.

Selection Criteria

We included double-masked randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in which any form of antibiotic treatment had been compared with placebo/vehicle in the management of acute bacterial conjunctivitis. This included topical, systemic and combination (for example, antibiotics and steroids) antibiotic treatments.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors (UN and SM) independently checked and reviewed the titles and abstracts of identified studies. We assessed the full text of all potentially relevant studies. We graded the included RCTs for methodological quality using Cochrane methodology. We performed data extraction in a standardised manner. We performed random-effects meta-analyses using RevMan.

Main Results

We identified 11 eligible RCTs which randomised a total of 3673 participants. One further trial, which was published in abstract form in 1990 but has yet to be reported fully, is currently 'awaiting assessment'. Six of the 11 included studies have been included for the first time in this latest (2012) update. The trials were heterogeneous in terms of their inclusion and exclusion criteria, the nature of the intervention, and the outcome measures assessed. We judged two of the trials to be of high quality and graded the remainder as poor quality. Meta-analyses of data on clinical and microbiological remission rates revealed that topical antibiotics were of benefit in improving 'early' (days two to five) clinical (risk ratio (RR) 1.36, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.15 to 1.61) and microbiological (RR 1.55, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.76) remission rates. At the 'late' time point (days six to 10), antibiotics were found to still confer modest benefits in clinical remission (RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.33) and microbiological cure rates (RR 1.37, 95% CI 1.24 to 1.52). By days six to 10, 41% (95% CI 38 to 43) of cases had resolved in those receiving placebo. We found no data on the cost-effectiveness of antibiotics. No serious outcomes were reported in either the active or placebo arms of these trials, suggesting that important sight-threatening complications are an infrequent occurrence.

Authors' Conclusions

Although acute bacterial conjunctivitis is frequently self limiting, the findings from this updated systematic review suggest that the use of antibiotic eye drops is associated with modestly improved rates of clinical and microbiological remission in comparison to the use of placebo. Use of antibiotic eye drops should therefore be considered in order to speed the resolution of symptoms and infection.

### Antibiotic prophylaxis for skin toxicity induced by antiepidermal growth factor receptor agents: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115TKAoW]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Topical and systemic prophylactic measures, which are administered before the development of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-related acneiform rash, are appropriate interventions to mitigate the intensity of skin toxicity. We have performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate whether prophylactic antibiotics may reduce the occurrence and severity of anti-EGFR drug-related skin rashes. A systematic review was performed by searching Medline, Scopus, Embase, CINAHL, LILACS, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library from inception until March 2016 for publications regarding the pre-emptive role of antibiotics for EGFR-induced skin rashes. Fixed- or random-effects meta-analyses, according to heterogeneity, were used to summarize odds ratios of skin toxicity with antibiotic use. Of the 827 citations found in the search, 13 studies comprising 1073 patients were included in the analysis. In 12 studies, patients in the prophylactic antibiotic arms had a lower risk of developing a skin rash (odds ratio 0.53, 95% confidence interval 0.39–0.72, P < 0.01) than patients without antibiotic prophylaxis. In particular, moderate-to-severe toxicities (grades 2–4) were reduced by nearly two-thirds (odds ratio 0.36, 95% confidence interval 0.22–0.60, P < 0.01) in 13 studies. This translated to a 26% absolute difference of high-grade skin rash compared with the control arms (from 50% to 24%). The results of this meta-analysis show that the risk of skin rash after treatment with anti-EGFR agents for solid tumours was significantly lower in patients taking prophylaxis with antibiotics than in those who were not. Therefore, taking pre-emptive tetracyclines for several weeks at the start of anti-EGFR treatment can significantly reduce the incidence and severity of cutaneous acneiform rash.

A 38-year-old woman presented to casualty with bilateral red eyes associated with a recent upper respiratory tract infection. This was initially diagnosed as conjunctivitis, however systemic review revealed an erythematous facial and skin rash, mildly swollen lips and mild swallowing difficulties. The patient was referred for an urgent medical assessment, by which time she was found to have erythema affecting 54% of her body surface area and diagnosed with suspected toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). She rapidly deteriorated over 24hours with a spreading blistering skin rash and airway compromise requiring urgent intubation and admission to the intensive treatment unit (ITU). Subsequent skin biopsies confirmed the diagnosis of TEN, attributed to recent use of ibuprofen. Treatment included broad-spectrum antibiotics and high-dose corticosteroids. The patient had a prolonged hospital stay and developed severe scarring of the ocular surface. She was discharged home and remains under continuing outpatient follow-up with ophthalmology and dermatology teams.

Biopsy demonstrating a superficial and deep perivascular, periadnexal interstitial infiltrate with eosinophils

Despite only mildly elevated IgE levels, STAT3 ‐associated HIES was considered, given the clinical and histopathologic evidence for eosinophilic folliculitis, and other dysmorphic features including coarse facial features. Testing was positive for a known pathogenic STAT3 variant (1144 C > T, Arg382Trp), confirming the diagnosis of autosomal dominant HIES. The patient was started on immune globulin replacement therapy to prevent life‐threatening infection, but this did not improve her skin findings. She was also treated with topical steroids, topical tacrolimus, emollients, long‐acting antihistamines, and anti‐staphylococcal therapeutics including topical mupirocin, bleach baths, and a host of oral antibiotics including oral cephalexin, erythromycin, and trimethoprim‐sulfamethoxazole. Despite these therapeutic efforts, her skin continued to flare every 2–3 weeks, and she subsequently developed crusting of the eyes, nose, and external auditory canal, with significant impairment in quality of life due to itch and pain (Figure 3). Multiple cultures from these sites were negative for microorganisms. At this time, dupilumab was considered due to case reports demonstrating improvement in atopic manifestations of hyper‐IgE syndrome, likely mechanistic efficacy based on the known pathologic disruption of IL‐4, and failure of all other trialed therapies. Dupilumab was initiated with a loading dose of 600 mg followed by 300 mg every 4 weeks based on a weight 22 kg. At 2 months, she had excellent response with great improvement both clinically and symptomatically, with complete resolution of her recalcitrant itch and pain. Now, at 6 months after initiation of treatment at age 3 years, she continues to have durable response with no adverse effects, and no additional infections (Figure 4).

### Clinical practice guideline (update): adult sinusitis [^115RNr7c]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2015). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis guideline — action statements for diagnosis and management: The development group made a strong recommendation that clinicians recommend intranasal steroids for patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR whose symptoms affect their quality of life, and a strong recommendation that clinicians recommend oral second-generation/less sedating antihistamines for patients with AR and primary complaints of sneezing and itching. The panel further states that clinicians should make the clinical diagnosis of AR when patients present with a history and physical examination consistent with an allergic cause and 1 or more of the following symptoms: nasal congestion, runny nose, itchy nose, or sneezing, with findings that include, but are not limited to, clear rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, pale discoloration of the nasal mucosa, and red and watery eyes. For testing, clinicians should perform and interpret, or refer to a clinician who can perform and interpret, specific IgE (skin or blood) allergy testing for patients with a clinical diagnosis of AR who do not respond to empiric treatment, or where the diagnosis is uncertain, or when knowledge of the specific causative allergen is needed to target therapy. The panel adds that clinicians should assess associated conditions such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, sleep-disordered breathing, conjunctivitis, rhinosinusitis, and otitis media, and clinicians should offer, or refer to a clinician who can offer, immunotherapy (sublingual or subcutaneous) for patients with AR who have inadequate response to symptoms with pharmacologic therapy with or without environmental controls.

### Demeclocycline (demeclocycline hydrochloride) [^116nsxPd]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Information for Patients

Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema. Concurrent use of tetracyclines with oral contraceptives may render oral contraceptives less effective (see Drug Interactions). Patients should be informed that demeclocycline HCl tablets should be taken at least 1 hour before meals or 2 hours after meals (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION). Unused supplies of tetracycline antibiotics should be discarded by the expiration date. Patients who are experiencing headache, dizziness, light-headedness, vertigo, or blurred vision while on demeclocycline therapy, should be cautioned about driving vehicles or using hazardous machinery while receiving demeclocycline therapy (see WARNINGS).

Patients should be counseled that antibacterial drugs, including demeclocycline HCl tablets, should only be used to treat bacterial infections. They do not treat viral infections (e.g., the common cold). When demeclocycline HCl tablets are prescribed to treat a bacterial infection, patients should be told that although it is common to feel better early in the course of therapy, the medication should be taken exactly as directed.

Skipping doses or not completing the full course of therapy may (1) decrease the effectiveness of the immediate treatment and (2) increase the likelihood that bacteria will develop resistance and will not be treatable by demeclocycline HCl tablets or other antibacterial drugs in the future.

Diarrhea is a common problem caused by antibiotics which usually ends when the antibiotic is discontinued. Sometimes after starting treatment with antibiotics, patients can develop watery and bloody stools (with or without stomach cramps and fever) even as late as two or more months after having taken the last dose of the antibiotic. If this occurs, patients should contact their physician as soon as possible.

Laboratory Tests

In venereal diseases when coexistent syphilis is suspected, darkfield examination should be done before treatment is started and the blood serology repeated monthly for at least 4 months. In long-term therapy, periodic laboratory evaluation of organ systems, including hematopoietic, renal and hepatic, should be performed. All patients with gonorrhea should have a serologic test for syphilis at the time of diagnosis. Patients treated with demeclocycline HCl should have a follow-up serologic test for syphilis after 3 months.

WARNINGS

NOT FOR OPHTHALMIC USE.

NOT FOR INJECTION.

Serious and occasionally fatal hypersensitivity (anaphylactic) reactions, some following the first dose, have been reported in patients receiving systemic quinolones, including ofloxacin. Some reactions were accompanied by cardiovascular collapse, loss of consciousness, angioedema (including laryngeal, pharyngeal or facial edema), airway obstruction, dyspnea, urticaria, and itching. If an allergic reaction to ofloxacin is suspected, stop the drug. Serious acute hypersensitivity reactions may require immediate emergency treatment. Oxygen and airway management, including intubation, should be administered as clinically indicated.

Wilderness Medical Society — conjunctivitis in wilderness settings is common, as "Conjunctivitis is the most common cause of a red eye", with "Common etiologies includ[ing] allergies, viruses, and bacteria". Bacterial conjunctivitis "gives a purulent discharge whereas viral conjunctivitis tends to give a watery discharge". Management differs by cause: "Treatment of allergic and viral conjunctivitis is primarily supportive, and bacterial conjunctivitis is treated with antibiotics", and "studies have demonstrated that use of antibiotics results in faster clinical and microbiological remission", with "no studies showing superiority of any one antibiotic" so choice is based on availability; "Erythromycin ointment, 1-cm ribbon, placed in the lower conjunctival sac 3 or 4 times daily for 7 days is a reasonable option". Because "viral conjunctivitis is extremely contagious", "proper hand washing is essential… to avoid spread throughout a group or to the contralateral eye". "Topical anesthetic eye drops are diagnostically beneficial and provide acute relief…; however,… they should not be used chronically as they are toxic to the corneal epithelium". Recommendation ratings: Topical or systemic antibiotics: 1A; Hand washing: 1C.

### Doxy 100 (tm) doxycycline [^117K4Xby]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

If CDAD is suspected or confirmed, ongoing antibiotic use not directed against C. difficile may need to be discontinued. Appropriate fluid and electrolyte management, protein supplementation, antibiotic treatment of C. difficile, and surgical evaluation should be instituted as clinically indicated.

Severe skin reactions, such as exfoliative dermatitis, erythema multiforme, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported in patients receiving doxycycline (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). If severe skin reactions occur, doxycycline should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy should be instituted.

Intracranial hypertension (IH, pseudotumor cerebri) has been associated with the use of tetracyclines including doxycycline. Clinical manifestations of IH include headache, blurred vision, diplopia, and vision loss; papilledema can be found on fundoscopy. Women of childbearing age who are overweight or have a history of IH are at greater risk for developing tetracycline associated IH. Concomitant use of isotretinoin and doxycycline should be avoided because isotretinoin is also known to cause pseudotumor cerebri.

Although IH typically resolves after discontinuation of treatment, the possibility for permanent visual loss exists. If visual disturbance occurs during treatment, prompt ophthalmologic evaluation is warranted. Since intracranial pressure can remain elevated for weeks after drug cessation patients should be monitored until they stabilize.

Photosensitivity manifested by an exaggerated sunburn reaction has been observed in some individuals taking tetracyclines. Patients apt to be exposed to direct sunlight or ultraviolet light, should be advised that this reaction can occur with tetracycline drugs, and treatment should be discontinued at the first evidence of skin erythema.

The anti-anabolic action of the tetracyclines may cause an increase in BUN. Studies to date indicate that this does not occur with the use of doxycycline in patients with impaired renal function.

### A tale of two patients [^114ZrwGd]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2023). Medium credibility.

The first patient, Mr. A, presented to me in Summer 2017 in a village in north India, with complaints of redness, watering, and itching in the affected eye for 3 days. He was harvesting fruit in the field when something fell in his eye from a tree, leading to redness and watering in the affected eye. Being from a rural area where it was more difficult to obtain care, he ignored it. He thought that some dust fell in his eye and that it would improve in few days. When his symptoms worsened, he came to me at an eye camp. The eye camp was a rural clinic that our team set up for 5 days to address various eye issues for people who could not make it into the city or otherwise afford care. We primarily performed screening for common ophthalmic problems.

I was a mere first-year ophthalmology resident at that time, heading a team of two senior optometrists and one paramedic. We were screening about 150 patients per day, and our main aim was to do refraction and dispense appropriate glasses. We also screened for ophthalmic problems such as cataracts, dry eyes, and diabetic retinopathy. Appropriate medicines were advised for such pathologies, and patients requiring surgery or further evaluation were asked to go our tertiary hospital, which was about 100 km from our camp. I had only one slit-lamp and a direct ophthalmoscope with me.

When Mr. A told his history, I also thought that some dust particle might still be lingering in his eye, leading to these symptoms. But as I scanned his eye under the slit-lamp, I could see 10 to 12 worms wriggling around on his conjunctiva. As soon as the light of slit lamp reached them, they wriggled away from light. They were white, translucent, cylindrical, and 1 to 2 mm long. After application of topical anesthesia, I removed the worms from the eye with forceps with great difficulty. I advised a topical broad-spectrum antibiotic, a topical weak steroid, and a topical lubricant. The worms could penetrate deeper, so it was imperative to look carefully. I examined underneath the lid folds but found no evidence of deeper involvement. I put the worms in a sterile bottle, planning on examining them further when I returned to my parent hospital (a tertiary, multispecialty, government hospital/college), but alas the sample was lost in transportation.

### Comparison of a single-dose vectored thermal pulsation procedure with a 3-month course of daily oral doxycycline for moderate-to-severe meibomian gland dysfunction [^112WHSye]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

While this study demonstrates that the daily use of doxycycline for 3 months can improve the signs and symptoms of moderate-to-severe MGD, the use of doxycycline is not without complication. There are many known side effects which serve to decrease patient compliance and may result in the termination of treatment altogether. This was evidenced in the current study; two subjects (14%) in the doxycycline group discontinued their treatment regimen due to stomach upset/intolerance to study medication. Previous publications reporting on the use of doxycycline for dry eye have documented numerous side effects, such as gastrointestinal problems (esophagitis, nausea, dyspepsia, diarrhea, abdominal cramps and decreased appetite), dermatological effects (itchy skin, urticaria and erythematous papules), hypersensitivity reactions (allergy and fever), increased tendency to bleed and stomatitis. Doxycycline has also been linked to liver failure and teratogenicity. Depending upon the dose and duration of doxycycline treatment, side effects have been reported in as high as 40% of the subjects. In addition, medical literature outside ophthalmology has reported some rare side effects such as esophageal ulcers, light-sensitive eruptions, photo-onycholysis and hypersensitivity syndrome reactions, single organ dysfunction and serum sickness such as reaction with doxycycline treatment.–Its long-term use has been related to potential development of bacterial resistance and increased risk of secondary infections with other organisms (particularly Candida sp.). Sub-microbial dosing of doxycycline has been advocated to lessen side effects and risk of microbial resistance, but even at low doses nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, headache, hypertension, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation and abdominal pain have been reported.

### Atopic dermatitis: diagnosis and treatment [^116u6aUq]. American Family Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Atopic dermatitis (atopic eczema) is a chronic relapsing and remitting inflammatory skin disease affecting one in 10 people in their lifetime. Atopic dermatitis is caused by a complex interaction of immune dysregulation, epidermal gene mutations, and environmental factors that disrupts the epidermis causing intensely pruritic skin lesions. Repeated scratching triggers a self-perpetuating itch-scratch cycle, which can have a significant impact on the patient's quality of life. The American Academy of Dermatology has created simple diagnostic criteria based on symptoms and physical examination findings. Maintenance therapy consists of liberal use of emollients and daily bathing with soap-free cleansers. Use of topical corticosteroids is the first-line treatment for atopic dermatitis flare-ups. Pimecrolimus and tacrolimus are topical calcineurin inhibitors that can be used in conjunction with topical corticosteroids as first-line treatment. Ultraviolet phototherapy is a safe and effective treatment for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis when first-line treatments are not adequate. Antistaphylococcal antibiotics are effective in treating secondary skin infections. Oral antihistamines are not recommended because they do not reduce pruritus. Evidence is lacking to support the use of integrative medicine in the treatment of atopic dermatitis. Newer medications approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration, such as crisaborole and dupilumab, are effective in treating atopic dermatitis but are currently cost prohibitive for most patients.

### Drug-induced periocular and ocular surface disorders: an EAACI position paper [^11478uxv]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

Various systemic and topical medications can induce ocular and periocular cutaneous adverse effects (AEs), ranging from mild to severe. These AEs may lead to ocular surface (OS) damage and, in some cases, life-threatening complications. Drug-induced ocular adverse reactions are generally classified into two primary categories: toxic reactions and/or allergic hypersensitivity reactions, which can be IgE or non-IgE-mediated. Systemic antibiotics, antivirals, and anticonvulsants can trigger adverse reactions that may involve the OS. Drugs like antihistamines, beta-blockers, antipsychotics, antidepressants, and isotretinoin are linked to dry eye disease. Topical treatments-including antibiotics, antiglaucoma medications, preservatives, contact lens solutions, and cosmetics-may elicit allergic or toxic ocular diseases. Recent evidence implicates ocular surface AEs in patients undergoing biological treatments for oncological diseases and atopic dermatitis. Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, used in the treatment of several cancers, have been associated with conjunctivitis, meibomitis, dry eye, periocular skin changes, and trichomegaly. Similarly, dupilumab, the first biologic approved for treating moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, has also been linked to OS disease with blepharoconjunctivitis. This position paper provides a comprehensive overview of the clinical presentations, diagnostic approaches, and treatment strategies for drug-induced ocular AEs, integrating the latest literature and clinical guidelines.

### Pruritus: diagnosis and management [^113paMho]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Pruritus is the sensation of itching; it can be caused by dermatologic and systemic conditions. An exposure history may reveal symptom triggers. A thorough skin examination, including visualization of the finger webs, anogenital region, nails, and scalp, is essential. Primary skin lesions indicate diseased skin, and secondary lesions are reactive and result from skin manipulation, such as scratching. An initial evaluation for systemic causes may include a complete blood count with differential, creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, liver function tests, iron studies, fasting glucose or A1C level, and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test. Additional testing, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, HIV screening, hepatitis serologies, and chest radiography, may also be appropriate based on the history and physical examination. In the absence of primary skin lesions, physicians should consider evaluation for malignancy in older patients with chronic generalized pruritus. General management includes trigger avoidance, liberal emollient use, limiting water exposure, and administration of oral antihistamines and topical corticosteroids. If the evaluation for multiple etiologies of pruritus is ambiguous, clinicians may consider psychogenic etiologies and consultation with a specialist.

Do not apply to the eyes or mucous membranes. Avoid treating seborrheic keratoses within the orbital rim. Direct contact with the eye can cause corneal injury (erosion, ulceration, perforation, and scarring), chemical conjunctivitis, eyelid edema, severe eye pain, or permanent eye injury, including blindness.

If accidental exposure occurs, flush with water for 15 to 30 minutes and initiate monitoring, and further evaluation as appropriate.

5.2	Local Skin Reactions

Skin reactions occurred in the treatment area after application of ESKATA. Severe local skin reactions included erosion, ulceration, vesiculation and scarring. [See Adverse Reactions (6.1)]. Do not initiate a second treatment course with ESKATA until the skin has recovered from any reaction caused by the previous treatment.

### Atopic dermatitis (eczema) guidelines: 2023 American academy of allergy, asthma and immunology / American college of allergy, asthma and immunology joint task force on practice parameters GRADE-and institute of medicine-based recommendations [^114bu1QN]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2024). High credibility.

Dupilumab — conjunctivitis risk and management: Conjunctivitis can be an adverse effect of dupilumab, and prior history of conjunctivitis and more severe AD before start of dupilumab may be risk factors for conjunctivitis with dupilumab treatment. Some protocols suggest a baseline eye examination by an ophthalmologist and the use of lubricant eye drops (artificial tears) twice daily when dupilumab is initiated, but practice varies, and mild conjunctivitis may respond to warm compresses, lubricant eye drops, and if there is concomitant allergen exposure, antihistamine eye drops. Patients with symptoms of severe ocular disease, such as blurred vision, decrease in visual acuity, purulent eye discharge, photophobia, or eye pain, should be urgently or emergently evaluated by ophthalmology. Treatment with ophthalmic topical corticosteroids or other immunomodulatory (tacrolimus, cyclosporine, lifitegrast) eye drops may be needed to treat the conjunctivitis and prevent its potential complications, and treatment of any eczema around the eyes with topical cortisone ointment or pimecrolimus cream may help with reducing ocular itching and rubbing.

### Safety of tralokinumab in adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis: pooled analysis of five randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II and phase III trials [^116PwKFP]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

Safety areas of interest

Skin infections requiring systemic treatment and eczema herpeticum occurred less frequently with tralokinumab vs. placebo, in 2.6% vs. 5.5% (9.7 vs. 22.8 events per 100 PYE; RR 0.4, 95% CI 0.3–0.7) and 0.3% vs. 1.5% (1.2 vs. 5.2 events per 100 PYE; RR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1–0.7), respectively (Figure 2; and Tables S11 and S12; see Supporting Information).

Figure 2
Initial treatment period, event rates for safety areas of interest in the atopic dermatitis pool, safety analysis set. Adverse events collected during the exposure time in the initial treatment period are shown. The rate is calculated as the number of events divided by the patient‐years of exposure (PYE) multiplied by 100. Adjusted rates were calculated using Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel weights. AESI, adverse event of special interest; HLT, high‐level term; q2w, every 2 weeks; SMQ, standardized MedDRA query.

Severe infection; serious infection; any infection requiring parenteral antibiotics; any infection requiring oral antibiotics, antivirals or antifungals > 2 weeks; and any opportunistic infection occurred at lower rates with tralokinumab vs. placebo (Table S13; see Supporting Information). Most opportunistic infections in both treatment groups were herpes virus infections, which occurred in fewer patients in the tralokinumab vs. placebo groups (Table S14; see Supporting Information).

Eye disorder AESIs classified by the investigator as conjunctivitis, keratoconjunctivitis or keratitis occurred in more patients receiving tralokinumab than placebo, in 7.9 and 3.4%, respectively (31.1 and 12.9 events per 100 PYE; RR 2.6, 95% CI 1.7–4.1) (Tables S11 and S15; see Supporting Information). The most frequent eye disorder AESI overall was conjunctivitis. Most eye disorder AESIs (98%) were mild or moderate (Figure 2), none were serious and the majority resolved during the study; however, two eye disorder events led to permanent discontinuation of tralokinumab (Table S11). Previous literature presents a detailed analysis of conjunctivitis events.

### The therapeutic effect of IPL on children with refractory seasonal allergic conjunctivitis [^111rd16j]. BMC Ophthalmology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Seasonal allergic conjunctivitis (SAC) is prevalent in spring and autumn, with symptoms mainly including eye swelling, itching or a foreign body sensation, accompanied by mucous-like secretions. Children have poor tolerance to pain and itching. After the onset of SAC, they often rub their eyes vigorously, which aggravates the allergic symptoms. SAC belongs to Type I hypersensitivity reaction, with acute onset and strong discomfort. Currently, the commonly used treatment method is anti-allergic drug therapy, including local application of anti-allergic eye drops and oral anti-allergic drugs. Most of the children patients can have their symptoms relieved rapidly after taking the medicine, and allergy symptoms can be smoothly managed through drug maintenance treatment. However, there are still some patients whose eye symptoms do not reach relief after medication or whose disease recurs despite continuous medication, causing great physical and psychological burdens to the children. Intense pulsed light (IPL) was previously mainly used in skin beauty treatments, featuring short operation time, no trauma and low pain. In recent years, multiple studies have shown that IPL treatment has significant effects on some ocular surface diseases such as meibomian gland dysfunction, dry eye, blepharitis and related keratoconjunctivitis. For SAC with poor response to drug treatment and recurrent episodes, our research attempts to use IPL treatment as an adjuvant treatment for refractory SAC and observe its efficacy.

### Guidelines of care for the management of acne vulgaris [^112MY6x1]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Supplemental Table VIII — prescribing information for combination clindamycin and tretinoin indicates topical treatment of acne vulgaris in patients ≥ 12 years of age, with dosing to apply a pea-sized amount to the entire face once daily at bedtime. Contraindications include patients with regional enteritis, ulcerative colitis, or history of antibiotic-associated colitis. In clinical trials, 21–41% of patients using combined clindamycin and tretinoin topically demonstrated successful treatment (using Evaluator's Global Severity score). Adverse effects/toxicities include erythema, scaling, itching, burning, stinging, nasopharyngitis, pharyngolaryngeal pain, dry skin, cough, and sinusitis. Interactions state that concomitant use of topical medications with a strong drying effect can increase skin irritation. Should not be used in combination with erythromycin-containing products. Should not be used in combination with neuromuscular blocking agents. Other issues advise to avoid exposure to sunlight and sunlamps, and that weather extremes, such as wind or cold, may be irritating. Pregnancy category is C; it is not known whether clindamycin or tretinoin is excreted in human milk; and safety and effectiveness have not been established in pediatric patients < 12 years of age.

### Drug-induced periocular and ocular surface disorders: an EAACI position paper [^117QQHBt]. Allergy (2025). Medium credibility.

ABSTRACT

Various systemic and topical medications can induce ocular and periocular cutaneous adverse effects (AEs), ranging from mild to severe. These AEs may lead to ocular surface (OS) damage and, in some cases, life‐threatening complications. Drug‐induced ocular adverse reactions are generally classified into two primary categories: toxic reactions and/or allergic hypersensitivity reactions, which can be IgE or non‐IgE‐mediated. Systemic antibiotics, antivirals, and anticonvulsants can trigger adverse reactions that may involve the OS. Drugs like antihistamines, beta‐blockers, antipsychotics, antidepressants, and isotretinoin are linked to dry eye disease. Topical treatments — including antibiotics, antiglaucoma medications, preservatives, contact lens solutions, and cosmetics — may elicit allergic or toxic ocular diseases. Recent evidence implicates ocular surface AEs in patients undergoing biological treatments for oncological diseases and atopic dermatitis. Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, used in the treatment of several cancers, have been associated with conjunctivitis, meibomitis, dry eye, periocular skin changes, and trichomegaly. Similarly, dupilumab, the first biologic approved for treating moderate‐to‐severe atopic dermatitis, has also been linked to OS disease with blepharoconjunctivitis. This position paper provides a comprehensive overview of the clinical presentations, diagnostic approaches, and treatment strategies for drug‐induced ocular AEs, integrating the latest literature and clinical guidelines.

### Diagnosis and treatment of rosacea: state of the art [^1175GeV2]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2012). Low credibility.

Rosacea is a common disorder that is both under recognized and undertreated. Prevalence figures indicate that it may be present in 1 of every 10 adults in a primary care waiting room. Untreated, patients with rosacea can suffer significant emotional, workplace, and social impairments. While rosacea has been recognized since ancient times, only recently have investigators begun to identify the pathophysiologic elements responsible for the characteristic erythema, flushing, dysesthesias, and papulopustular manifestations of the disease. Although the etiology of rosacea is unclear, inflammation appears to be a central element. Experimental evidence suggests that abnormalities of the skin's innate and adaptive immune responses may play pivotal roles. Once recognized, effective topical and systemic therapies can be prescribed to lessen the impact of the disease on the patient's life. Although initially administered in an empiric fashion, it now seems clear that the role of antibiotics in patients with rosacea depends upon their anti-inflammatory rather than their antimicrobial properties. Consequently, practitioners have the opportunity to practice good antibiotic stewardship when treating the disease, particularly with systemic therapies. Therapy with subantimicrobial dosing and with topical treatments can modulate the inflammation of rosacea without exerting antibiotic pressure responsible for the emergence of antibiotic resistance.

### Beyond skin rash: alpelisib-induced anaphylactic reactions [^112nCV23]. The Oncologist (2023). Medium credibility.

Given the extensive reports of alpelisib-induced rash, we considered a (regular) toxicodermal skin rash the most likely diagnosis. Still, given the clinical finding of some edema in her face, we also considered an allergic reaction in our differential diagnosis. We treated her symptoms initially with levocetirizine 10 mg QD (histamine receptor antagonist) with lubricating skin and eye ointments to relieve itching and her dry eyes, topical/systemic steroids were considered but omitted. In the days thereafter, her symptoms demised and she soon recovered. Subsequently, we had to decide how to proceed, taking into account that the patient experienced a significant decrease in the vaginal tumor mass, suggesting clinical benefit.

Given the recommendations to rechallenge in case of rash, together with the signs of clinical benefit, we discussed the risks and benefits of a continuation/restart with alpelisib with levocetirizine as pre-medication. Given the mild edema during the initial reaction, we proposed an in-hospital observed rechallenge with a reduced dose of alpelisib, together with levocetirizine. The rechallenge was initiated 16 days after the start of the initial reaction, with complete resolution of the edema and rash. Ninety minutes after a reduced dose of alpelisib (150 mg) was administered, the patient developed an anaphylactic reaction with angioedema with (mildly) swollen lips, edema in her face, chills, fever, hypotension, and reappearance of skin rash. No evident airway edema or obstruction was observed. Symptomatic treatment with clemastine, hydrocortisone, and IV fluids for this serious anaphylactic reaction were promptly initiated, adrenaline was considered but not given (mean arterial pressure (MAP) was ≥ 65 mmHg and no airway edema/obstruction) and alpelisib was permanently discontinued. Mild hypotension persisted for ± 48 hours; however, urine production as sign of organ perfusion was sufficient, without significant laboratory abnormalities (Table 1). A skin reaction persisted wherefore levocetirizine and ointments (including topical steroids) were continued. At a follow-up visit 6 days later, two bullae were present (Figure 1) for which the dermatologist was consulted and prednisone 30 mg QD was started. In the days thereafter, no new bullae emerged, the steroids were tapered and stopped and the patient made a full recovery in the following weeks. Although the 8-week evaluation CT-scan showed stable disease, palliative radiotherapy was initiated for local pain of the vaginal mass, indicating local progression.

Question 3: What is the most common organism found in this condition?
A. Malassezia furfur
B. Group A Streptococcus
C. Candida albicans
D. Staphylococcus aureus
E. Pseudomonas aeruginosa

Answers:

A. Malassezia furfur – Incorrect. There are no reported cases of M furfur superinfection occurring in drug-induced papulopustular eruptions.
B. Group A Streptococcus – Incorrect. While Group A Streptococcus superinfection is a possibility, there are no reported cases.
C. Candida albicans – Incorrect. In a retrospective chart review of 88 patients, only 1 patient had C albicans superinfection of the skin. However, C albicans superinfection can occur in onychomycosis or paronychia seen in patients taking EGFR inhibitors.
D. Staphylococcus aureus – Correct. This is the most reported organism to cause superinfection in EGFR inhibitor-induced skin reactions. Methicillin and tetracycline resistance has been reported, so it is critical to obtain a culture and sensitivity to determine appropriate antibiotic therapy.
E. Pseudomonas aeruginosa – Incorrect. There are reported cases of superinfection with P aeruginosa in patients with EGFR inhibitor-induced skin reactions, but it is not the most common causative organism. However, this case highlights the importance of obtaining a bacterial culture and sensitivity, since this was the culprit pathogen in this patient.

### Practical guidance for the evaluation and management of drug hypersensitivity: specific drugs [^111Q8k9u]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2020). High credibility.

Antimicrobial agents — penicillins general epidemiology reports that penicillins are commonly used to treat infections caused by both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms. Penicillin allergy is one of the most commonly reported drug allergies, with a prevalence of 5% to 10%, and the reported prevalence is higher among hospitalized patients, at 11% to 15%. Individuals with a history of penicillin hypersensitivity are more likely to receive alternative antibiotic therapy, which can lead to added expense.

### Antibiotic hypersensitivity reactions and approaches to desensitization [^116LBeSN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Before initiating antibiotic therapy, drug hypersensitivity is an important consideration, and a common strategy is to avoid giving patients medications when a high likelihood of severe reactions exists. With an increase in antibiotic resistance and a decrease in novel antibiotics, there is greater pressure to consider antibiotics in patients with a history of adverse reactions. The major concerns include IgE-mediated, or type I, reactions, anaphylaxis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Some antibiotics with similar characteristics, such as cephalosporins and penicillins, may be given safely to patients with a certain allergy profile. There is still greater concern when considering antibiotics for patients with reported allergy. Desensitization is a strategy to safely induce drug tolerance to a specific drug to limit the possibility of a type I reaction.

This review looks at the main issues around immediate hypersensitivity and the role and limitations of testing. The majority of literature on antibiotic hypersensitivity relates to β-lactam antibiotics, mainly because of the heavy usage of this class of drugs. Concerns around cross-reactivity always worry clinicians, particularly in the emergency situation. Reasonable data now exist in relation to β-lactam antibiotics and derivatives, which enable appropriate risk management to be undertaken. The available literature for other classes of antibiotics is also discussed.

### Allergic rhinitis: rapid evidence review [^111jPXAB]. American Family Physician (2023). Medium credibility.

Allergic rhinitis, the fifth most common chronic disease in the United States, is an immunoglobulin E-mediated process. A family history of allergic rhinitis, asthma, or atopic dermatitis increases a patient's risk of being diagnosed with allergic rhinitis. People in the United States are commonly sensitized to grass, dust mites, and ragweed allergens. Dust mite-proof mattress covers do not prevent allergic rhinitis in children two years and younger. Diagnosis is clinical and based on history, physical examination, and at least one symptom of nasal congestion, runny or itchy nose, or sneezing. History should include whether the symptoms are seasonal or perennial, symptom triggers, and severity. Common examination findings are clear rhinorrhea, pale nasal mucosa, swollen nasal turbinates, watery eye discharge, conjunctival swelling, and allergic shiners (i.e., dark circles under the eyes). Serum or skin testing for specific allergens should be performed when there is inadequate response to empiric treatment, if diagnosis is uncertain, or to guide initiation or titration of therapy. Intranasal corticosteroids are first-line treatment for allergic rhinitis. Second-line therapies include antihistamines and leukotriene receptor antagonists and neither shows superiority. If allergy testing is performed, trigger-directed immunotherapy can be effectively delivered subcutaneously or sublingually. High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters are not effective at decreasing allergy symptoms. Approximately 1 in 10 patients with allergic rhinitis will develop asthma.
