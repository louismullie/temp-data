## Question

Hypertension management in CKD

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about hypertension management in chronic kidney disease. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiologic relationship between hypertension and CKD to anchor why BP control matters. Then, I should verify the evidence base and controversies around BP targets, especially the SPRINT-driven < 120 mmHg recommendation versus more conservative targets. Next, I will examine standardized BP measurement and monitoring, followed by lifestyle interventions. After that, I need to review pharmacologic strategies, including RAAS blockade, diuretics, CCBs, and SGLT2 inhibitors, and how to handle hyperkalemia and resistant hypertension. Finally, I should individualize targets by patient characteristics, reconcile guideline differences, and synthesize a practical, stepwise algorithm with safety checks and follow-up plans.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic foundation: hypertension and CKD form a vicious cycle in which reduced renal function promotes volume expansion and neurohormonal activation, while elevated BP accelerates glomerular injury and fibrosis. This bidirectionality explains why BP control is central to slowing CKD progression and reducing cardiovascular events, which are the leading cause of death in CKD [^116rkm6x] [^112drtUz].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about targets; I need to check the highest-quality evidence. The 2021 KDIGO guideline recommends a systolic BP target of less than 120 mmHg for most adults with CKD not on dialysis, largely based on SPRINT and ACCORD-BP subgroup analyses showing reduced cardiovascular events and mortality with intensive control, including in CKD subgroups, though the renal endpoint signal was mixed and the evidence strength is graded as weak in many areas [^11727Ntj] [^117CkTEd] [^111tdgrn].

> Wait, let me verify the counterarguments before I overcommit to < 120 mmHg. The 2023 ESH/ERA guidance cautions against lowering office BP below 120/70 mmHg in CKD and generally recommends < 130/80 mmHg for most patients if tolerated, citing concerns about generalizability, frailty, and adverse events. The 2024 ESC guidance aligns with a 120–129 mmHg SBP target if tolerated in moderate-to-severe CKD with eGFR > 30, and JNC 8 favored < 140/90 mmHg for CKD, reflecting older trial evidence and differing risk–benefit interpretations [^116V9WZP] [^1177p1vz] [^1126tHYP] [^1118rZC5].

> I should double-check the meta-analytic synthesis. A 2024 Cochrane review comparing lower versus standard BP targets in CKD found little to no difference in mortality, serious adverse events, or cardiovascular events, and low certainty for renal outcomes, reinforcing that the net benefit of intensive targets is uncertain across heterogeneous CKD populations and measurement contexts [^116bJBsk].

> Next, I should review how to measure BP, because target interpretation hinges on method. KDIGO 2021 emphasizes standardized office BP measurement with proper preparation and technique, and recommends supplementing with out-of-office monitoring (ABPM or HBPM) to detect white-coat or masked hypertension and to guide titration; I need to ensure we are not mixing routine clinic values with standardized values when judging targets [^111U1yHr] [^1154BG9o].

> Let me consider lifestyle therapy next, and I should confirm specifics. Sodium restriction to less than 2 g/day is foundational and synergizes with RAAS blockade, though I must avoid advising restriction in sodium-wasting nephropathies; moderate-intensity physical activity to at least 150 minutes/week is advised when tolerated, with individualized adjustments for frailty, falls risk, and cardiorespiratory fitness; weight loss and alcohol reduction are reasonable if safe, though CKD-specific evidence is limited [^114mUJqB] [^114KV17y] [^115QjqwW] [^1129XPoB].

> I will now examine pharmacologic first-line therapy, and I need to ensure I get RAAS blockade right. For CKD with albuminuria, ACE inhibitors or ARBs are indicated and should be titrated to the maximum tolerated dose; for CKD without albuminuria, RAAS blockade can still be considered, but the renal protective effect is less certain, so shared decision-making is key; never combine ACEi, ARB, and direct renin inhibitor due to harm [^113vfrPP] [^112LTfQZ] [^111HQ8YZ] [^112qKYMb].

> Hold on, I should verify monitoring after RAAS initiation. Check serum creatinine and potassium within 2–4 weeks of starting or up-titrating, and continue therapy unless creatinine rises by more than 30% from baseline. If hyperkalemia occurs, preferentially manage potassium rather than reflexively reducing RAAS therapy, using dietary counseling, medication review, and potassium binders as appropriate [^113tHCgg] [^11652hvH] [^111qsZWG].

> Next, I should review add-on therapy and diuretic selection. If BP remains uncontrolled on RAAS blockade, add a thiazide-like diuretic or a long-acting dihydropyridine CCB. In advanced CKD with eGFR < 30, favor loop diuretics over thiazides for volume control, and consider chlorthalidone in stage 4 CKD for resistant hypertension with close monitoring [^114JVgoG] [^117Corcw] [^115TfUpd].

> But wait, what if the patient has resistant hypertension? I need to ensure a structured approach. Confirm true resistance with standardized and out-of-office measurements, assess adherence and secondary causes, then consider adding a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist such as spironolactone or eplerenone with vigilant potassium monitoring, recognizing hyperkalemia risk. In selected cases, consider SGLT2 inhibitors for additional cardiorenal benefit and modest BP lowering when eGFR is at least 20–25 mL/min/1.73 m² [^113RrpeN] [^114EidhK] [^117ExuaL] [^112qgKSX].

> I should confirm how to individualize targets by patient characteristics. For frail older adults, those with high falls risk, very limited life expectancy, or symptomatic orthostatic hypotension, less intensive BP-lowering is reasonable; conversely, younger patients, those with heavy proteinuria, or very high cardiovascular risk may reasonably pursue more intensive targets if tolerated, with shared decision-making about trade-offs [^113k4R4p] [^1177p1vz] [^111tZe8b].

> Let me reconsider the guideline landscape to avoid overgeneralization. KDIGO 2021 leans toward < 120 mmHg SBP using standardized measurement, ESH 2023 recommends < 130/80 mmHg for most and cautions against < 120/70 mmHg, ESC 2024 supports 120–129 mmHg SBP if tolerated in moderate-to-severe CKD with eGFR > 30, and JNC 8 favored < 140/90 mmHg. These differences reflect varying interpretations of SPRINT, ACCORD, and meta-analyses, so local implementation and patient preference should guide the target chosen [^11727Ntj] [^116V9WZP] [^1126tHYP] [^1118rZC5].

> Next, I should review a practical, stepwise algorithm and make sure it aligns with evidence. Start with standardized office BP and out-of-office monitoring to phenotype hypertension. Initiate lifestyle measures and begin or optimize RAAS blockade if albuminuria is present. Titrate to effect and monitor renal function and potassium. Add a thiazide-like diuretic or CCB if needed. For persistent elevation, add an MRA with potassium surveillance. Consider SGLT2 inhibitors for cardiorenal benefit when appropriate. Throughout, reassess tolerance, orthostatic symptoms, and eGFR trends to adjust intensity [^111U1yHr] [^113vfrPP] [^114EidhK] [^117ExuaL].

> I should double-check safety and follow-up cadence. Reassess BP, adherence, and adverse effects every 3–6 months, and after any medication change recheck labs within 2–4 weeks. Maintain vigilance for hyperkalemia, AKI, and symptomatic hypotension, especially in older adults and those with autonomic dysfunction or polypharmacy [^113tHCgg] [^113k4R4p].

> Finally, let me synthesize the bottom line and ensure internal consistency. Intensive BP control likely improves cardiovascular outcomes in many CKD patients, but the optimal SBP target remains controversial: a pragmatic approach is to aim for < 130/80 mmHg in most patients if tolerated, consider < 120 mmHg in selected, higher-risk, nonfrail patients using standardized measurement, and accept < 140/90 mmHg when frailty, falls risk, or intolerance preclude lower targets. RAAS blockade with albuminuria, lifestyle therapy, and structured monitoring are the noncontroversial cornerstones, with add-on therapy tailored to resistance and comorbidity profile [^117CkTEd] [^1177p1vz] [^1126tHYP] [^1118rZC5].

Hypertension management in CKD requires **individualized BP targets** and **RAAS blockade** as first-line therapy. For most adults with CKD, target **SBP < 120 mmHg** using standardized office measurement [^11727Ntj] reduces cardiovascular events and mortality, but adjust to < 130/80 mmHg if not tolerated or in older/frail patients [^1177p1vz]. Initiate **ACEi/ARB** for patients with albuminuria [^1138SmpY] and titrate to the maximum tolerated dose [^112LTfQZ]; monitor creatinine and potassium within 2–4 weeks [^113tHCgg]. Add a CCB or thiazide/loop diuretic if needed [^117Corcw], and consider MRAs or SGLT2 inhibitors for resistant hypertension or additional cardiorenal benefit [^114EidhK] [^112qgKSX]. Lifestyle measures include sodium restriction, weight loss, and regular exercise [^112FLo5i] [^114mUJqB]; avoid dual RAAS blockade and NSAIDs [^112qKYMb] [^116TpWH4].

---

## Blood pressure targets in CKD

- **KDIGO 2021 guidelines**: Target SBP < 120 mmHg using standardized office BP measurement for most adults with CKD not on dialysis [^11727Ntj] [^117CkTEd].
- **Individualization**: Adjust targets based on tolerance, age, comorbidities, and frailty; consider less intensive targets in frail or elderly patients [^113k4R4p] [^1126tHYP].
- **Controversy**: Some guidelines (e.g. ESH 2023) recommend < 130/80 mmHg for most CKD patients, especially if SBP < 120 mmHg is not tolerated [^1177p1vz] [^116ExCuQ].

---

## Pharmacological management

### First-line therapy

First-line therapy is **RAAS blockade** with an ACE inhibitor or ARB for patients with albuminuria (UACR ≥ 30 mg/g) [^113vfrPP] to slow CKD progression and reduce cardiovascular risk [^116EmwEr]. Titrate to the **maximum tolerated dose** to achieve optimal BP control and cardiorenal protection [^112LTfQZ].

---

### Monitoring and adjustment

Check **serum creatinine and potassium** 2–4 weeks after initiating or adjusting RAAS inhibitors [^113tHCgg]; if creatinine rises > 30% or hyperkalemia occurs, reassess and adjust therapy [^11652hvH]. For **hyperkalemia**, manage with dietary changes, medication review, and potassium binders rather than automatically reducing RAAS inhibitor dose [^116EmwEr].

---

### Second-line and adjunctive therapies

- **Calcium channel blockers (CCBs)**: Effective adjuncts, especially in combination with RAAS inhibitors [^117Corcw].
- **Diuretics**: Thiazide or loop diuretics are recommended for volume control and resistant hypertension [^117Corcw] [^115TfUpd].
- **Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs)**: Consider spironolactone or eplerenone for resistant hypertension, with close monitoring for hyperkalemia [^114EidhK].
- **SGLT2 inhibitors**: Recommended for patients with CKD and eGFR > 20 mL/min/1.73 m², providing additional cardiorenal benefits and modest BP reduction [^112qgKSX] [^117ExuaL].

---

## Lifestyle modifications

- **Sodium restriction**: Dietary sodium intake < 2 g/day is recommended [^notfound].
- **Weight loss**: Encourage weight loss in overweight/obese patients [^1129XPoB].
- **Physical activity**: At least 150 minutes/week of moderate-intensity exercise, tailored to tolerance [^114mUJqB].
- **Alcohol moderation**: Limit alcohol intake [^1129XPoB].

---

## Special considerations

Avoid **dual RAAS blockade** — combining ACE inhibitors and ARBs — due to increased risk of hyperkalemia and renal dysfunction [^112qKYMb]. In **advanced CKD**, individualize BP targets and monitor closely for adverse effects [^111tZe8b]. For **resistant hypertension**, use a multidisciplinary approach, including MRAs, SGLT2 inhibitors, and careful monitoring [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

| **Recommendation** | **Details** |
|-|-|
| BP target | < 120 mmHg SBP (standardized office measurement) if tolerated; individualize if not tolerated |
| First-line therapy | ACE inhibitor or ARB for albuminuria |
| Monitoring | Creatinine and potassium 2–4 weeks after initiation or dose change |
| Second-line therapy | CCBs, thiazide/loop diuretics |
| Adjunctive therapy | MRAs, SGLT2 inhibitors |
| Lifestyle | Sodium restriction, weight loss, physical activity, alcohol moderation |
| Avoid | Dual RAAS blockade, NSAIDs |

---

Hypertension management in CKD centers on **RAAS blockade**, **individualized BP targets**, and **lifestyle interventions**, with therapy tailored to tolerance, comorbidities, and CKD stage.

### Optimal targets for blood pressure control in chronic kidney disease: the debate continues [^113pNdkq]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Because advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) is often an exclusion criterion for large randomized trials of the management of hypertension, clinical decision making for these patients has relied on a few small, specific studies and much extrapolation. Several blood pressure treatment guidelines have recently been reissued. This review explores the applicability of the revised recommendations to CKD.

Recent Findings

Many new publications are meta-analyses, guidelines and debates about guidelines. New data from trials are scant. Three revised guidelines (KDIGO, JNC8, KHA-CARI) recommend a target of less than 140/90. Most antihypertensive drugs are equally effective - but this rule may not apply to advanced CKD. Proteinuric renal disease is seen as an exception; all three guidelines set a target of 130/80 and the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker (but not both) is preferred.

Summary

There is no shortage of new commentary and advice, but evidence strength and generalizability diminish as the kidneys fail and the impact of calcified vessels and salt and water overload increases. A risk-based approach to intervention may be no less valuable than targets. Clinical trials of individuals with advanced CKD will be needed to identify effective treatments and may see a resurgence of the role of spironolactone.

### Protecting renal function in the hypertensive patient: clinical guidelines [^114RfV1r]. American Journal of Hypertension (2005). Low credibility.

Both the incidence and prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) are increasing in the United States and worldwide. Patients with both diabetes and hypertension have a dramatically increased risk of cardiovascular and renal events, particularly if both conditions are not effectively controlled. Failure to achieve the goals for blood glucose, blood pressure (BP), and lipids is associated with high morbidity from cardiovascular and renal events as well as the high costs of treating these morbid events. There is increasing evidence that cardiovascular events, renal failure, and premature death can be prevented or delayed by earlier identification and treatment of CKD, as well as by taking measures to prevent its onset. A large subgroup of hypertensive patients may be at increased risk for developing CKD and should be targeted for appropriate monitoring and treatment. Not all antihypertensive regimens are equally effective at preserving renal function. Clinical trials indicate that the primary clinical goal in the treatment of patients with CKD is to lower BP to the recommended goal as well as to reduce albuminuria and proteinuria to the lowest levels possible. This is achieved optimally by using agents that block the renin-angiotensin system in concert with other agents that reduce proteinuria and BP.

### Blood pressure targets in chronic kidney disease: an update on the evidence [^117GVShJ]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hypertension is the leading modifiable cause of cardiovascular events and of mortality and is generally considered as a direct cause of chronic kidney disease. Defining optimal blood pressure targets in patients with chronic kidney disease is therefore of critical importance.

Recent Findings

Over the recent years, results and post-hoc analyses of several important trials comparing blood pressure targets which included patients with chronic kidney disease have been published. Although these results provide important means to understand the consequences of high blood pressure and to improve the management of hypertension in chronic kidney disease, they led to remarkably different interpretations and recommendations in the current guidelines.

Summary

The present review summarizes the current evidence and areas of controversy for the definition of blood pressure targets in patients with chronic kidney disease.

Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2014). Low credibility.

Developing guidelines on a subject as broad as hypertension is difficult, especially when the guidance relates to hypertension in the chronic kidney disease (CKD) population. The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Guideline Development Group has applied a rigorous methodology in reviewing all available evidence, and their recommendations are consistent with the evidence-based approach. As a result, the European Renal Best Practice endorses most of its recommendations. However, the Work Group feels that some additional advice could help clinicians in daily practice: (i) individualization of treatment should be taken into account, especially (cardiovascular) co-morbidities, age, gender and race; (ii) side-effects, such as postural dizziness should be monitored closely, particularly in elderly, diabetics and patients with arterial stiffness; (iii) the importance of salt restriction should not be neglected; (iv) although angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) and angiotensin receptor blocker (ARBs) remain a cornerstone in the management of hypertension, and especially cardiovascular protection, in some particular situations such as in advanced CKD and in patients without proteinuria, their role is less well defined; (v) as most CKD patients need more than one antihypertensive drug to achieve blood pressure control, the specific (renal) (dis)advantages of other classes than ACE-I or ARB should be taken into account.

### The ideal blood pressure target for patients with chronic kidney disease… [^111KXw7z]. JAMA Network (2017). Excellent credibility.

Kovesdy CP. The Ideal Blood Pressure Target for Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease — Searching for the Sweet Spot. JAMA Intern Med. 2017; 177: 1506–1507. doi:
10. 1001/jamainternmed.
2017. 4467. Hypertension is the number 1 cardiovascular risk factor, and its treatment prevents major cardiovascular events and lowers mortality. Most patients with chronic kidney disease have hypertension, and CKD is characterized by extremely high cardiovascular disease rates. It is thus not surprising that antihypertensive therapy is a universal part of CKD management, and its benefits are broadly accepted. Notwithstanding the general consensus about the pathophysiologic relevance of hypertension, there has been controversy in the medical community regarding the ideal therapeutic blood pressure target in patients with CKD.

Fueling this controversy are concerns about the presence of a J-curve and the paucity of dedicated randomized clinical trials testing the effects of BP lowering to levels that approach physiologic normalcy. These uncertainties are further accentuated when assessing the effects of antihypertensive therapy on all-cause mortality, which includes deaths with causes entirely unrelated to hypertension.

### What should be the goal blood pressure in nondiabetic chronic kidney disease? [^11289RHG]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize the available evidence on whether a lower blood pressure (BP) treatment target can ameliorate the progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD), and prevent cardiovascular events in CKD patients.

Recent Findings

The three prospective, randomized controlled trials which addressed the question of progression of CKD suggest that a lower BP treatment goal (< 130/80mmHg) may lead to better preservation of renal function, but only in those patients with proteinuria of more than 300mg/day. However, the evidence is not conclusive. We are not aware of adequately powered, randomized trials that have assessed the efficacy of lower target BP levels for the prevention of cardiovascular events specifically in nondiabetic CKD patients. The available circumstantial evidence (e.g., subgroup analyses of CKD patients in cardiovascular trials) fails to reveal a clear benefit of a lower BP goal.

Summary

There is currently no convincing evidence to recommend a lower than standard BP treatment target of less than 140/90mmHg for all patients with nondiabetic CKD. A lower treatment target of less than 130/80mmHg may delay renal disease progression but only in patients with proteinuria.

### Clinical decision support for hypertension management in chronic kidney disease: a randomized clinical trial [^113N9V3d]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 37 million adults in the United States, and for patients with CKD, hypertension is a key risk factor for adverse outcomes, such as kidney failure, cardiovascular events, and death.

Objective

To evaluate a computerized clinical decision support (CDS) system for the management of uncontrolled hypertension in patients with CKD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This multiclinic, randomized clinical trial randomized primary care practitioners (PCPs) at a primary care network, including 15 hospital-based, ambulatory, and community health center-based clinics, through a stratified, matched-pair randomization approach February 2021 to February 2022. All adult patients with a visit to a PCP in the last 2 years were eligible and those with evidence of CKD and hypertension were included.

Intervention

The intervention consisted of a CDS system based on behavioral economic principles and human-centered design methods that delivered tailored, evidence-based recommendations, including initiation or titration of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors. The patients in the control group received usual care from PCPs with the CDS system operating in silent mode.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was the change in mean systolic blood pressure (SBP) between baseline and 180 days compared between groups. The primary analysis was a repeated measures linear mixed model, using SBP at baseline, 90 days, and 180 days in an intention-to-treat repeated measures model to account for missing data. Secondary outcomes included blood pressure (BP) control and outcomes such as percentage of patients who received an action that aligned with the CDS recommendations.

Results

The study included 174 PCPs and 2026 patients (mean [SD] age, 75.3 [0.3] years; 1223 [60.4%] female; mean [SD] SBP at baseline, 154.0 [14.3] mm Hg), with 87 PCPs and 1029 patients randomized to the intervention and 87 PCPs and 997 patients randomized to usual care. Overall, 1714 patients (84.6%) were treated for hypertension at baseline. There were 1623 patients (80.1%) with an SBP measurement at 180 days. From the linear mixed model, there was a statistically significant difference in mean SBP change in the intervention group compared with the usual care group (change, -14.6 [95% CI, -13.1 to -16.0] mm Hg vs -11.7 [-10.2 to -13.1] mm Hg; p = 0.005). There was no difference in the percentage of patients who achieved BP control in the intervention group compared with the control group (50.4% [95% CI, 46.5% to 54.3%] vs 47.1% [95% CI, 43.3% to 51.0%]). More patients received an action aligned with the CDS recommendations in the intervention group than in the usual care group (49.9% [95% CI, 45.1% to 54.8%] vs 34.6% [95% CI, 29.8% to 39.4%]; P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that implementing this computerized CDS system could lead to improved management of uncontrolled hypertension and potentially improved clinical outcomes at the population level for patients with CKD.

The 2020 Hypertension Canada guideline recommends 30–60 minutes of moderate-intensity dynamic exercise 4–7 days per week (grade D), and targets may be challenging in CKD due to comorbidities and frailty with potential risks such as falls; moderate physical activity within the daily living environment may be easiest to implement. While weight loss and reduction in alcohol consumption are recommended for hypertension in the general population, the KDIGO work group did not provide specific recommendations for these in CKD due to lack of evidence; the KDOQI work group recommends that these interventions should be discussed with patients with hypertensive CKD, with targets like those for the general population if they can be implemented safely as there is no specific evidence for harm in CKD.

### Canadian Society of Nephrology commentary on the 2012 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in CKD [^1154mcBH]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) 2012 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure (BP) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) provides the structural and evidence base for the Canadian Society of Nephrology (CSN) commentary on this guideline's relevancy and application to the Canadian health care system. While in general agreement, we provide commentary on 13 of the 21 KDIGO guideline statements. Specifically, we agreed that nonpharmacological interventions should play a significant role in the management of hypertension in patients with CKD. We also agreed that the approach to the management of hypertension in elderly patients with CKD should be individualized and take into account comorbid conditions to avoid adverse outcomes from excessive BP lowering. In contrast to KDIGO, the CSN Work Group believes there is insufficient evidence to target a lower BP for nondiabetic CKD patients based on the presence and severity of albuminuria. The CSN Work Group concurs with the Canadian Hypertension Education Program (CHEP) recommendation of a target BP for all non-dialysis-dependent CKD patients without diabetes of ≤ 140 mm Hg systolic and ≤ 90 mm Hg diastolic. Similarly, it is our position that in diabetic patients with CKD and normal urinary albumin excretion, raising the threshold for treatment from < 130 mmHg systolic BP to < 140 mm Hg systolic BP could increase stroke risk and the risk of worsening kidney disease. The CSN Work Group concurs with the CHEP and the Canadian Diabetic Association recommendation for diabetic patients with CKD with or without albuminuria to continue to be treated to a BP target similar to that of the overall diabetes population, aiming for BP levels < 130/80 mm Hg. Consistent with this, the CSN Work Group endorses a BP target of < 130/80 mm Hg for diabetic patients with a kidney transplant. Finally, in the absence of evidence for a lower BP target, the CSN Work Group concurs with the CHEP recommendation to target BP < 140/90 mm Hg for nondiabetic patients with a kidney transplant.

### Common questions about the initial management of hypertension [^115w1TWQ]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

Hypertension is the most common chronic condition treated by family physicians. Elevated blood pressure is associated with an increased risk of heart failure, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular disease, and death. Treatment of hypertension reduces the risk of these events. Several lifestyle modifications are associated with improvements in blood pressure, including the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, sodium restriction, regular exercise, and moderate weight loss. There is strong evidence that reducing diastolic blood pressure to less than 90 mm Hg is beneficial in adults older than 30 years. Although there is good evidence to support reducing systolic blood pressure to less than 150 mm Hg in adults older than 60 years, the evidence in younger adults is insufficient to recommend a specific goal. Black patients with chronic kidney disease who are treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker to a blood pressure of less than 140/90 mm Hg experience slower declines in glomerular filtration rates than patients treated with other medications. A blood pressure goal of less than 140/90 mm Hg is recommended in patients with chronic kidney disease and in those with diabetes mellitus. Thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and calcium channel blockers are the preferred medications in nonblack patients; thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers are preferred in black patients.

INTRODUCTION

In June 2023, the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) presented and published the new 2023 ESH Guidelines for the Management of Arterial Hypertension, a document that was endorsed by the European Renal Association (ERA). Following recent evidence, several novel recommendations relevant to the management of hypertension in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) appeared in these Guidelines. The present report is a synopsis of the sections of the ESH Guidelines that are relevant to the daily clinical practice of nephrologists, prepared by experts from ESH and ERA. The sections summarized are those referring to the role of CKD in hypertension staging and cardiovascular (CV) risk stratification, the evaluation of hypertension-mediated kidney damage and, most importantly, the management of hypertension in patients with CKD. Of note, the 2023 ESH Guidelines and the present document do not discuss issues relevant to hypertension in patients with CKD G5 on chronic dialysis treatment; this field is extensively discussed in a previous joint consensus statement of the two societies.

Strategies and interventions to improve health-related quality of life

Hypertension with CKD is often not prioritized on the World Health Organization (WHO) of non-communicable diseases, and only a few countries have clear policies or programs in place to prevent and treat CKD. This lack of prioritization is particularly evident in LMICs, where limited healthcare resources, competing health priorities, and a focus on infectious diseases often leave chronic conditions under-addressed. Recognizing the complexities involved, effective management of hypertension in CKD patients is critical due to the bidirectional relationship between the two conditions. Uncontrolled hypertension not only worsens kidney damage but also increases the risk of cardiovascular complications, making blood pressure control essential for slowing CKD progression and preventing ESKD.

In LMICs, these challenges are further exacerbated by limited access to essential medications, lack of diagnostic tools for regular monitoring, and a shortage of skilled nephrology personnel. Infrastructure gaps, particularly in rural areas, and financial constraints also hinder the implementation of standardized treatment protocols. Given the complexities of managing hypertension in CKD patients, individualized therapeutic strategies are required to mitigate these risks in LMICs. Such strategies must consider resource limitations and focus on cost-effective, scalable interventions, such as patient education, lifestyle modifications, and improving access to affordable medications (see Fig. 2).

Comprehensive Self-Management Approaches for Hypertension with CKD

Managing risk factors that can increase blood pressure and damage the kidneys is clinically important because it can prevent or minimize the likelihood of further blood pressure increases and kidney injury. Risk factors that can increase blood pressure include high sodium intake, low potassium intake, obesity, alcohol consumption, lack of physical activity, and unhealthy eating patterns. The Kidney Disease Improves Global Outcome (KDIGO) clinical practice guidelines advocate self-care as a model of CKD treatment, underscoring the integration of information, guidance, and education to promote self-management behaviors throughout all phases of CKD. Similarly, the National Institute of Care and Excellence (NICE) guidelines, there is a recommendation to develop structures that foster self-care and empower individuals with CKD to make informed decisions about their health.

### Practical approach to detection and management of chronic kidney disease for the primary care clinician [^116TpWH4]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

A panel of internists and nephrologists developed this practical approach for the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative to guide assessment and care of chronic kidney disease (CKD) by primary care clinicians. Chronic kidney disease is defined as a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 mL/min/1.73 m² and/or markers of kidney damage for at least 3 months. In clinical practice the most common tests for CKD include GFR estimated from the serum creatinine concentration (eGFR) and albuminuria from the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio. Assessment of eGFR and albuminuria should be performed for persons with diabetes and/or hypertension but is not recommended for the general population. Management of CKD includes reducing the patient's risk of CKD progression and risk of associated complications, such as acute kidney injury and cardiovascular disease, anemia, and metabolic acidosis, as well as mineral and bone disorder. Prevention of CKD progression requires blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg, use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers for patients with albuminuria and hypertension, hemoglobin A1c ≤ 7% for patients with diabetes, and correction of CKD-associated metabolic acidosis. To reduce patient safety hazards from medications, the level of eGFR should be considered when prescribing, and nephrotoxins should be avoided, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The main reasons to refer to nephrology specialists are eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m(2), severe albuminuria, and acute kidney injury. The ultimate goal of CKD management is to prevent disease progression, minimize complications, and promote quality of life.

### Summary of KDIGO guideline. what do we really know about management of blood pressure in patients with chronic kidney disease? [^1139xS8B]. Kidney International (2013). Low credibility.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes Clinical Practice Guideline for management of blood pressure (BP) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) supersedes the 2004 Kidney Disease Quality Outcomes Initiative document on this topic. The new guideline has been designed to assist clinical decision making in patients with CKD who are not receiving dialysis. The recommendations in the guideline acknowledge that no single BP target is optimal for all CKD patients and encourage individualization of treatment depending on age, the severity of albuminuria, and comorbidities. In general, the available evidence indicates that in CKD patients without albuminuria the target BP should be ≤ 140mmHg systolic and ≤ 90mmHg diastolic. However, in most patients with an albumin excretion rate of ≥ 30mg/24h (i.e., those with both micro- and macroalbuminuria), a lower target of ≤ 130mmHg systolic and ≤ 80mmHg diastolic is suggested. In achieving BP control, the value of lifestyle changes and the need for multiple pharmacological agents is acknowledged. Use of agents that block the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is recommended or suggested in all patients with an albumin excretion rate of ≥ 30mg/24h. Recommendations are almost identical in CKD patients with and without diabetes. Special considerations relevant to children and those of older age and those who have received a kidney transplant are included. Ongoing controversies in BP management in the context of CKD are highlighted along with key areas for future research.

### Chronic kidney disease as a situation of high added risk in hypertensive patients [^114ysDhe]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Recent guidelines for the management of hypertension have recognized the relevance of renal function on cardiovascular prognosis of hypertensive patients. In fact, growing evidences have confirmed that as soon as renal function exhibits minor derangements, cardiovascular risk starts a continuous rise until the development of end-stage renal disease. Both estimated glomerular filtration rate and urinary albumin excretion are associated with an increased incidence of cardiovascular events and death among hypertensive patients and in general population. Consequently, hypertensive patients presenting with chronic kidney disease are considered by guidelines as high-risk patients, and strict blood pressure control should be considered as a part of an integrative therapeutic approach, including correction of anemia, treatment of dyslipidemia, cessation of tobacco use, and antiplatelet therapy. This paper briefly reviews the most recent evidences about pharmacologic therapies in high-risk patients, focusing on benefits related to improvement of cardiovascular risk factors in hypertensive patients with chronic kidney disease.

### Management of blood pressure in patients with chronic kidney disease not receiving dialysis: synopsis of the 2021 KDIGO clinical practice guideline [^117CkTEd]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Description

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure (BP) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not receiving dialysis is an update of the KDIGO 2012 guideline on the same topic and reflects new evidence on the risks and benefits of BP-lowering therapy among patients with CKD. It is intended to support shared decision making by health care professionals working with patients with CKD worldwide. This article is a synopsis of the full guideline.

Methods

The KDIGO leadership commissioned 2 co-chairs to convene an international Work Group of researchers and clinicians. After a Controversies Conference in September 2017, the Work Group defined the scope of the evidence review, which was undertaken by an evidence review team between October 2017 and April 2020. Evidence reviews were done according to the Cochrane Handbook. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach was used to guide the development of the recommendations and rate the strength and quality of the evidence. Practice points were included to provide guidance when evidence was insufficient to make a graded recommendation. The guideline was revised after public consultation between January and March 2020.

Recommendations

The updated guideline comprises 11 recommendations and 20 practice points. This synopsis summarizes key recommendations pertinent to the diagnosis and management of high BP in adults with CKD, excluding those receiving kidney replacement therapy. In particular, the synopsis focuses on recommendations for standardized BP measurement and a target systolic BP of less than 120 mm Hg, because these recommendations differ from some other guidelines.

### Recent advances in the management of secondary hypertension: chronic kidney disease [^113LTjkB]. Hypertension Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertension in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the most commonly observed comorbidity and is a risk factor for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) as well as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality. Therefore, suitable blood pressure (BP) control in CKD patients is very important in preventing both CVD and ESRD. We herein describe the recommendations of target BP and the pharmacological drug options from the evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for CKD in 2018 by the Japanese Society of Nephrology (JSN CKD 2018) and recent advances in the management of hypertension in CKD, including sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 2 inhibitors, mineralocorticoid receptor blockers, and renal denervation. In particular, SGLT2 inhibitors are a new class of "antihypertensive drugs" that have a homeostatic mechanism that regulates body fluid volume in addition to diuretic action, which may be closely associated with their cardiorenal protective properties.

### Executive summary of the KDIGO 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in chronic kidney disease [^11727Ntj]. Kidney International (2021). Medium credibility.

The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2021 Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Blood Pressure in Chronic Kidney Disease for patients not receiving dialysis represents an update to the KDIGO 2012 guideline on this topic. Development of this guideline update followed a rigorous process of evidence review and appraisal. Guideline recommendations are based on systematic reviews of relevant studies and appraisal of the quality of the evidence. The strength of recommendations is based on the "Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation" (GRADE) approach. The scope includes topics covered in the original guideline, such as optimal blood pressure targets, lifestyle interventions, antihypertensive medications, and specific management in kidney transplant recipients and children. Some aspects of general and cardiovascular health, such as lipid and smoking management, are excluded. This guideline also introduces a chapter dedicated to proper blood pressure measurement since all large randomized trials targeting blood pressure with pivotal outcomes used standardized preparation and measurement protocols adhered to by patients and clinicians. Based on previous and new evidence, in particular the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) results, we propose a systolic blood pressure target of less than 120 mm Hg using standardized office reading for most people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) not receiving dialysis, the exception being children and kidney transplant recipients. The goal of this guideline is to provide clinicians and patients a useful resource with actionable recommendations supplemented with practice points. The burden of the recommendations on patients and resources, public policy implications, and limitations of the evidence are taken into consideration. Lastly, knowledge gaps and recommendations for future research are provided.

### Blood pressure targets for hypertension in people with chronic… [^111vH4Nj]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

CLINICAL QUESTION Is there a benefit to using a lower blood pressure target of 130/80 mm Hg for hypertension in people with chronic kidney disease compared with a higher BP target of 140 to 160/90 to 100 mm Hg. EVIDENCE-BASED ANSWER Having a lower BP target of 130/80 mm Hg for hypertension in people with CKD compared with a higher BP target of 140 to 160/90 to 100 mm Hg does not reduce total mortality, total serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, total cardiovascular mortality, or progression to end-stage renal disease.

1. PRACTICE POINTERS The prevalence of CKD is estimated to be 14% in the United States. 2 Systemic hypertension is the second leading cause of CKD in the United States behind diabetes and is an independent risk factor for adverse cardiovascular events.

1, 2 The authors of this Cochrane review aimed to identify the effects of lower vs higher BP targets on morbidity and mortality in people with CKD.

### 2018 ESC / ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension [^117Corcw]. European Heart Journal (2018). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) — therapeutic strategies for hypertension are as follows: In patients with diabetic or non-diabetic CKD, it is recommended that an office blood pressure (BP) of ≥ 140/90 mmHg be treated with lifestyle advice and BP-lowering medication, and it is recommended to lower systolic blood pressure (SBP) to a range of 130–139 mmHg; individualized treatment should be considered according to its tolerability and impact on renal function and electrolytes. Renin–angiotensin system (RAS) blockers are more effective at reducing albuminuria than other antihypertensive agents and are recommended as part of the treatment strategy in hypertensive patients in the presence of microalbuminuria or proteinuria; a combination of a RAS blocker with a calcium channel blocker (CCB) or a diuretic is recommended as initial therapy, whereas combinations of two RAS blockers are not recommended. In case of reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), specifically eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m², avoid thiazide/thiazide-like diuretics and consider using a loop diuretic if required.

### Updates to management of adults with chronic kidney disease… [^116EmwEr]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

RENIN-ANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM INHIBITORS Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, which include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, have a well-established history of reducing all-cause mortality and providing renal and cardioprotective benefits in adults who have CKD with or without diabetes. 4, 5 The KDIGO guideline recommends titrating the dosage of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors to achieve a systolic blood pressure less than 120 mm Hg in patients with high blood pressure and CKD. A higher goal is reasonable for patients with frailty, at risk for falls, or with limiting factors such as symptomatic postural hypotension. For patients with nonemergent hyperkalemia, the KDIGO guideline has shifted away from recommending reflexive discontinuation of renin-angiotensin system inhibitors.

Instead, management suggestions include reviewing modifiable factors such as dietary potassium intake, eliminating medications that increase serum potassium, and prescribing potassium-lowering medications such as diuretics when appropriate. The National Kidney Foundation provides a patient-friendly overview of high- and low-potassium foods in English and Spanish. Referral to a nephrologist may also be appropriate. Clinicians can initiate newer potassium-binding agents such as patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate. These are well-tolerated and safe for long-term use compared with earlier agents. STATINS Although cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of death in patients with CKD regardless of stage, older risk prediction models underestimated ASCVD risk in patients with CKD.

Another significant update in the KDIGO guideline is the recommendation for use of ASCVD risk estimators that either have been validated in cohorts of individuals with CKD or that incorporate eGFR and albuminuria. 1 Such tools include the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation CKD patch and the Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease Events calculator. The KDIGO guideline emphasizes use of statins in most patients with CKD. 1 Statins that do not require renal dosing adjustments include the high-intensity statin atorvastatin and moderate-intensity statins pravastatin and simvastatin. Rosuvastatin is a high-intensity statin requiring dosing adjustment, with a maximum recommended dose of 10 mg/day if the creatinine clearance is less than 30 mL/min/1.73 m².

### Self-management interventions for chronic kidney disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115rMqTN]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a progressive disease that leads to End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD: maintenance dialysis or kidney transplantation), cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Approximately 440,000 patients begin dialysis each year worldwide, and annual costs of dialysis and kidney transplants range between US $35,000 and 100,000. This can strain healthcare budgets. Clinical decision making for CKD is challenging due to the heterogeneity of kidney diseases, variability in rates of disease progression, and the competing risk of cardiovascular mortality, the most common cause of death worldwide. Furthermore, CKD is not included in the list of priorities for most non-communicable diseases (NCD), and few countries have clear policies or public programs to prevent and control CKD.

CKD management includes slowing the progression to ESRD and decreasing the risk of cardiovascular complications through management of kidney function and CKD progression risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes. In addition to medication, managing risk factors is important clinically because it can prevent, or at least minimize, the likelihood of further renal injury. Long-term CKD management requires a high level of patient involvement, both in decision-making and in the implementation of care. There is growing recognition that patients want to be involved as equal partners in their care. The goal of self-management is to identify strategies that can be used to help patients manage their condition(s) while leading active and productive lives. This includes goal setting, problem solving, symptom management, and shared decision-making, and these strategies are applicable for a diverse population. For patients with CKD, this encompasses a spectrum of behaviors ranging from adherence to medication, exercise, and diet recommendations (self-management maintenance) to recognition of early warning signs, and self-adjustment of home-care regimens.

Despite an established tradition of patient self-management of ESRD, and self-management being a well-established treatment strategy for other chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension, evidence to support its use for CKD non-dialysis is limited. To lighten the economic burden of ESRD, strategies must be implemented to prevent the progression from early-stage CKD. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we synthesized results from RCTs to evaluate the effects of self-management intervention on major renal outcomes and mortality in non-dialysis adults with CKD. We also assessed effect modification by proteinuria and blood pressure.

### Blood pressure lowering and major cardiovascular events in people with and without chronic kidney disease: meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^114aSREj]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Conclusions

These overviews provide clear evidence that a broad range of different blood pressure lowering regimens provide protection against cardiovascular complications in patients with and without chronic kidney disease. Specifically, blood pressure lowering per se, not the effects of a particular drug class (such as renin-angiotensin system blockade), seems to be significantly associated with lower cardiovascular risk in early stage chronic kidney disease, possibly suggesting the importance of blood pressure lowering as a driver of cardiovascular risk reduction. These findings should help to guide decision making for many physicians and their patients, given the absence of clear evidence to date supporting recommendations (for particular drug classes) to reduce the cardiovascular risk among people with early stage chronic kidney disease. As people with chronic kidney disease are at greatly increased cardiovascular risk, the benefits of blood pressure lowering in this population are large. The broader use of blood pressure lowering drugs, along with other proved treatments such as lipid lowering, will both improve outcomes for affected individuals and help to reduce the escalating global burden of cardiovascular disease.

### Hypertension in chronic kidney disease-treatment standard 2023 [^115TfUpd]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2023). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is very common and remains often poorly controlled in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Accurate blood pressure (BP) measurement is the essential first step in the diagnosis and management of hypertension. Dietary sodium restriction is often overlooked, but can improve BP control, especially among patients treated with an agent to block the renin-angiotensin system. In the presence of very high albuminuria, international guidelines consistently and strongly recommend the use of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker as the antihypertensive agent of first choice. Long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers and diuretics are reasonable second- and third-line therapeutic options. For patients with treatment-resistant hypertension, guidelines recommend the addition of spironolactone to the baseline antihypertensive regimen. However, the associated risk of hyperkalemia restricts the broad utilization of spironolactone in patients with moderate-to-advanced CKD. Evidence from the CLICK (Chlorthalidone in Chronic Kidney Disease) trial indicates that the thiazide-like diuretic chlorthalidone is effective and serves as an alternative therapeutic opportunity for patients with stage 4 CKD and uncontrolled hypertension, including those with treatment-resistant hypertension. Chlorthalidone can also mitigate the risk of hyperkalemia to enable the concomitant use of spironolactone, but this combination requires careful monitoring of BP and kidney function for the prevention of adverse events. Emerging agents, such as the non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist ocedurenone, dual endothelin receptor antagonist aprocitentan and the aldosterone synthase inhibitor baxdrostat offer novel targets and strategies to control BP better. Larger and longer term clinical trials are needed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of these novel therapies in the future. In this article, we review the current standards of treatment and discuss novel developments in pathophysiology, diagnosis, outcome prediction and management of hypertension in patients with CKD.

Hypertension in chronic kidney disease — blood pressure and renin–angiotensin system management are stated as follows: We suggest intensive blood pressure management to reduce mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate below 60 mL/minute/1.73 m2. In patients with hypertension and albuminuria (i.e., urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [UACR] > 30 mg/g), we recommend the use of either an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker to slow the progression of chronic kidney disease. We suggest the addition of a thiazide diuretic or calcium channel blocker to reduce blood pressure in patients with chronic kidney disease and hypertension not controlled on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker. In patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) currently on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker, we suggest continuing therapy, unless there is drug intolerance or other adverse event.

### Association of blood pressure with clinical outcomes in older adults with chronic kidney disease [^115mutop]. Age and Ageing (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common in older adults and is an established risk factor for mortality and cardiovascular events. Kidney disease: improving global outcomes (KDIGO) described the grading system used internationally for CKD, with Grade 3 representing moderate impairment, Grade 4 severe impairment and Grade 5 kidney failure. Global estimates of CKD3–5 prevalence for adults over 70 years range from 14.1% in the Netherlands to 56.6% in Ireland, higher in women. CKD and hypertension frequently co-exist and independently increase the risk of cardiovascular outcomes. Blood pressure (BP) management is a key aspect of CKD clinical care. However, studies incorporated into guidelines on BP in CKD largely exclude adults older than 70 years, despite comprising over half of the CKD population.

Debate continues about safe levels of BP reduction in older adults. Until recently, the consensus internationally for older adults with CKD without diabetes or significant proteinuria was to control BP to a target of < 140/90 mmHg. CKD guidelines do not specifically recommend adjustments for BP management in older adults. The recently published American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association hypertension guidelines suggest a 'team-based approach to risk/benefit' in older adults, but currently BP-associated prognosis in older adults with moderate to severe CKD is not known.

### Recognition and management of resistant hypertension [^113RrpeN]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

Despite improvements in hypertension awareness and treatment, 30%-60% of hypertensive patients do not achieve BP targets and subsequently remain at risk for target organ damage. This therapeutic gap is particularly important to nephrologists, who frequently encounter treatment-resistant hypertension in patients with CKD. Data are limited on how best to treat patients with CKD and resistant hypertension, because patients with CKD have historically been excluded from hypertension treatment trials. First, we propose a consistent definition of resistant hypertension as BP levels confirmed by both in-office and out-of-office measurements that exceed appropriate targets while the patient is receiving treatment with at least three antihypertensive medications, including a diuretic, at dosages optimized to provide maximum benefit in the absence of intolerable side effects. Second, we recommend that each patient undergo a standardized, stepwise evaluation to assess adherence to dietary and lifestyle modifications and antihypertensive medications to identify and reduce barriers and discontinue use of substances that may exacerbate hypertension. Patients in whom there is high clinical suspicion should be evaluated for potential secondary causes of hypertension. Evidence-based management of resistant hypertension is discussed with special considerations of the differences in approach to patients with and without CKD, including the specific roles of diuretics and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists and the current place of emerging therapies, such as renal denervation and baroreceptor stimulation. We endorse use of such a systematic approach to improve recognition and care for this vulnerable patient group that is at high risk for future kidney and cardiovascular events.

Principles for Algorithm Development

The following is a summary of principles recommended by the AHA, ACC, and CDC for creating an effective hypertension management algorithm:

Base algorithm components and processes on the best available science.
Format to be simple to update as better information becomes available.
Create feasible, simple implementation strategy.
Include patient version at appropriate scientific and language literacy level.
Consider costs of diagnosis, monitoring, treatment.
Develop algorithm in format easily used within a team approach to health care.
Develop algorithm in a format able to be incorporated into electronic health records for use as clinical decision support.
Include a disclaimer to ensure that the algorithm is not used to counter the treating healthcare provider's best clinical judgment.

The purpose of these principles is to establish a common platform for the development and implementation of hypertension management algorithms tailored to different practice settings and populations. We note the last principle supports the notion that treatment guidelines serve to facilitate a systematic approach to the management of hypertension, but provide appropriate modifications based on specific patient characteristics, preferences and other pragmatic factors (eg, cost, pill burden, risks of certain side effects) to optimize a personalized approach to the care of individual patients. In addition, ongoing randomized clinical trials (eg, SPRINT) are addressing optimal blood pressure targets for specific patient subgroups such as the elderly and patient with chronic kidney diseases to maximize net clinical benefit and avoid unnecessary complications.

### Representation of real-world adults with chronic kidney disease in clinical trials supporting blood pressure treatment targets [^1163Yp3y]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Clinical Perspective

Hypertension affects > 80% of adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and its treatment is a cornerstone of CKD management. The 2021 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines for high blood pressure (BP) management lowered thresholds for diagnosis and treatment of hypertension from a BP treatment target of < 130/80 or < 140/90 mm Hg, depending on level of albuminuria, to a systolic BP < 120 mm Hg for all adults with CKD. These recommendations were largely based on findings of SPRINT (Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial), which showed that intensive versus standard BP targets reduced mortality and cardiovascular events in nondiabetic participants with elevated cardiovascular risk. Additional support for this recommendation was based on the ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes) trial demonstrating a reduction in stroke with intensive versus standard BP targets and a meta‐analysis demonstrating that intensive versus standard control of blood pressure lowered mortality in participants with CKD.

A major challenge of translating evidence to clinical practice is the assessment of generalizability, or how well the studies supporting guidelines reflect the patients to whom the findings will be applied. The underrepresentation of individuals with CKD in cardiovascular clinical trials is widely documented; however, less is known about how well trial participants with CKD represent real‐world adults with CKD. This concept, the population representativeness of trial participants, is a measure of the study sample's coverage of the target population. As a quantifiable metric, population representativeness can be used to assess the relevance of evidence in clinical practice and can inform how evidence is implemented in communities, health systems, and populations.

We aimed to evaluate the population representativeness of clinical trials supporting the 2021 KDIGO BP guidelines using data from 2 large integrated US health care systems, the Veterans Affairs (VA) and Kaiser Permanente of Southern California (KPSC). We sought to (1) determine the proportion of real‐world adults with CKD who meet the definition for elevated BP by the KDIGO guideline and would be recommended additional pharmacotherapy, (2) determine the proportion who would be eligible for enrollment in the BP trials that informed the guidelines, and (3) describe major reasons for trial ineligibility.

### Managing kidney disease with blood-pressure control [^112W1F7M]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

The progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is largely independent of the underlying kidney disorder once renal function has fallen below a critical level. Hypertension is an independent risk factor for disease progression in both adult and pediatric patients with kidney disorders. Increasing evidence from clinical trials indicates that the rate of CKD progression can be lowered by pharmacological interventions. Nephroprotective strategies currently focus on the blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers provide efficient control not only of blood pressure, but also of proteinuria, an effect associated with improved long-term nephroprotection compared with other antihypertensive drug classes. In addition, evidence for an additional nephroprotective advantage of tight blood-pressure control towards the low-normal range in young patients and patients with proteinuria is emerging. In this Review, we describe the role of hypertension in CKD and discuss the therapeutic principle of the prevention of CKD progression with antihypertensive agents.

### Blood pressure targets in chronic kidney disease: still no consensus [^1141zur6]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Despite a strong consensus that treatment of hypertension is fundamental to strategies seeking to slow chronic kidney disease (CKD) progression and reduce the associated risk of cardiovascular events (CVE), controversy persists regarding optimal blood pressure (BP) targets. This article reviews the evidence for different targets, discusses associated controversies and suggests approaches to improve BP control.

Recent Findings

Landmark clinical trials established the principle that lower BP targets are associated with slower progression of CKD in people with a greater magnitude of proteinuria and previous guidelines recommended a target BP of < 130/80mmHg for those with proteinuria. However, the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial provided new evidence that a systolic BP target of < 120mmHg was associated with a reduced risk of CVE, though there was no impact on CKD progression and there was concern about an increase in renal adverse events. Nevertheless, 2021 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guidelines recommended systolic BP < 120 mmHg, though other updated guidelines did not follow this trend. All guidelines emphasise the importance of standardised BP measurement and a personalised approach.

Summary

An individualised and shared decision-making approach to BP target setting and management is recommended, guided by standardised BP measurement.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^115CjvEw]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately. Patients want to be assured that blood pressure (BP) treatment will reduce their disease burden, while clinicians want guidance on hypertension management using the best scientific evidence. This report takes a rigorous, evidence-based approach to recommend treatment thresholds, goals, and medications in the management of hypertension in adults. Evidence was drawn from randomized controlled trials, which represent the gold standard for determining efficacy and effectiveness. Evidence quality and recommendations were graded based on their effect on important outcomes. There is strong evidence to support treating hypertensive persons aged 60 years or older to a BP goal of less than 150/90 mm Hg and hypertensive persons 30 through 59 years of age to a diastolic goal of less than 90 mm Hg; however, there is insufficient evidence in hypertensive persons younger than 60 years for a systolic goal, or in those younger than 30 years for a diastolic goal, so the panel recommends a BP of less than 140/90 mm Hg for those groups based on expert opinion. The same thresholds and goals are recommended for hypertensive adults with diabetes or nondiabetic chronic kidney disease (CKD) as for the general hypertensive population younger than 60 years. There is moderate evidence to support initiating drug treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, calcium channel blocker, or thiazide-type diuretic in the nonblack hypertensive population, including those with diabetes. In the black hypertensive population, including those with diabetes, a calcium channel blocker or thiazide-type diuretic is recommended as initial therapy. There is moderate evidence to support initial or add-on antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker in persons with CKD to improve kidney outcomes. Although this guideline provides evidence-based recommendations for the management of high BP and should meet the clinical needs of most patients, these recommendations are not a substitute for clinical judgment, and decisions about care must carefully consider and incorporate the clinical characteristics and circumstances of each individual patient.

The commentary states that "evidence is strongest for recommendations related to management of diabetes and hypertension", and that "it would be justifiable to first devote effort to setting blood pressure and glycemic goals, tailor antihypertensive and hypoglycemic therapies to individual patients, and monitor for side effects of the medications". It also notes that "reduction in dietary sodium may facilitate achievement of blood pressure goals".

### Management of hypertension in chronic kidney disease [^112drtUz]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2015). Medium credibility.

Hypertension is a common comorbidity in patients with impaired kidney function. The kidney exerts a marked degree of control over blood pressure through various mechanisms, such as by regulating sodium balance and hormone secretion through the activity of the renin-angiotensin system. The kidney is susceptible to injury, and if already damaged can be at risk of further loss of function as a consequence of elevated blood pressure. Once elevated blood pressure is identified, a combination of sensible lifestyle measures, such as sodium restriction and weight loss, with pharmacological intervention to reduce blood pressure will usually achieve blood pressure goals. In this Review, we outline the importance of blood pressure control for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), the mechanisms that affect blood pressure control, and the basis for non-drug and drug therapies. We further discuss the rationale for < 140 mmHg systolic and < 90 mmHg diastolic targets for blood pressure in patients with CKD, with consideration for tighter targets in the setting of proteinuria.

### Is the KDIGO systolic blood pressure target [^1166ERae]. Hypertension (2022). Medium credibility.

Meticulous management of hypertension is important in chronic kidney disease (CKD) to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease, mortality, and progression of CKD. The recently published Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline on blood pressure (BP) management in CKD stresses the importance of standardized BP measurement and strict control of BP. This is a useful document that will help to improve the management of hypertension in CKD globally. However, the recommendation of systolic BP target of < 120 mmHg by KDIGO is controversial. It is based on weak evidence derived mainly from a single randomized controlled trial and its CKD subgroup analysis. Here, we review the current evidence surrounding BP target in CKD. We argue that the target recommended by KDIGO is not generalizable to the majority of people with CKD. Standardized BP measurements are challenging to implement outside specialist hypertension and research clinics, and the target of < 120 mmHg BP systolic cannot be extrapolated to routine clinic BP measurements. If applied to routine BP measurement, this target will expose the multimorbid and frail CKD patients to the risk of adverse events including falls and fractures. Furthermore, it will not be achievable in the majority of CKD patients. The target recommended by KDIGO is an outlier among contemporary major international hypertension guidelines and is likely to perplex clinicians. We believe the KDIGO-recommended target systolic BP < 120 mmHg for CKD is inappropriate in the majority of CKD patients and it may even be harmful for patients managed in routine clinical practice.

### Blood pressure management in hypertensive people with non-dialysis chronic kidney disease in queensland, Australia [^114vpgpz]. BMC Nephrology (2019). Medium credibility.

The WHO has established a specific target to reduce prevalence of elevated BP (≥ 140/90 mmHg) by 25% by 2025 and has recommended that healthcare professionals measure BP at all relevant clinical encounters. The World Hypertension League (WHL) expert committee also recommended a set of standardised performance indicators to improve BP control at both the population and healthcare organisation levels. The National Heart Foundation of Australia produced and updated "Guidelines for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in adults" for the information of health professionals in 2016. These guidelines have been endorsed by Kidney Health Australia, the National Stroke Foundation and the High Blood Pressure Research Council of Australia. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners has recommended the Guideline for approval as an Accepted Clinical Resource. There are strong recommendations for treatment strategies and treatment targets for people with hypertension, representing strong public policy approaches. Despite these, controlling elevated blood pressure in individual people and at a population level remains a large national challenge.

### Current issues in the management and monitoring of hypertension in chronic kidney disease [^112FLo5i]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review highlights recent developments in the management and monitoring of hypertension in adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD), not on dialysis.

Recent Findings

Ambulatory blood pressure (BP) monitoring and self-measured BP monitoring can classify abnormal BP patterns better than clinic BP readings. Self-measured BP monitoring lowers BP and allows tailoring of antihypertensive treatment. Dosing of antihypertensive medication at night improves nocturnal hypertension. Recent guidelines recommend a BP target less than 140/90mmHg for patients with CKD without proteinuria and less than 130/80mmHg for those with proteinuria. Lower salt intake is associated with a greater effect of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockage in CKD. Lifestyle modification resulting in weight loss reduces BP in individuals with CKD. Of overweight or obese CKD patients, 8% report taking weight loss medication, which is a potential safety concern. Weight loss from intensive lifestyle modification in individuals with diabetes prevents CKD.

Summary

Although we have effective tools to monitor and lower BP, we still need clinical outcome studies to inform BP targets for specific age groups, types of CKD disease, and comorbidities. How to treat obesity to improve hypertension and other comorbidities in patients with CKD remains another important area of research.

### Elucidating the complex interplay between chronic kidney disease and hypertension [^116rkm6x]. Hypertension Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension share a complex relationship, each exacerbating the progression of the other. CKD contributes to hypertension by decreasing renal function, leading to fluid retention and increased plasma volume, whereas hypertension exacerbates CKD by increasing glomerular pressure and causing renal damage. This review examines the intertwined nature of CKD and hypertension, exploring the factors driving hypertension in CKD and how hypertension accelerates CKD progression. It discusses the role of the renin-angiotensin system and inflammatory cytokines in this relationship, as well as the potential of blood pressure management to slow renal decline. While studies suggest that meticulous blood pressure control can help attenuate CKD progression, optimal management strategies remain unclear and require further investigation. This review also evaluates the evidence surrounding strict antihypertensive therapy in patients with CKD, considering both diabetic and non-diabetic cases. It recommends blood pressure targets based on CKD stage and presence of diabetes, emphasizing the importance of individualized treatment approaches. Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors are highlighted as a key pharmacological intervention due to their renal protective effects, particularly in patients with CKD with proteinuria. However, evidence regarding their efficacy in patients with CKD but without proteinuria is inconclusive. This review underscores the need for comprehensive approaches to effectively address the intertwined nature of CKD and hypertension and calls for further research to optimize clinical management strategies in this complex interplay.

### KDOQI US commentary on the 2021 KDIGO clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in CKD [^112yshRd]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) convened a work group to review the 2021 KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) guideline for the management of blood pressure in chronic kidney disease (CKD). This commentary is the product of that work group and presents the recommendations and practice points from the KDIGO guideline in the context of US clinical practice. A critical addition to the KDIGO guideline is the recommendation for accurate assessment of blood pressure using standardized office blood pressure measurement. In the general adult population with CKD, KDIGO recommends a goal systolic blood pressure less than 120 mm Hg on the basis of results from the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) and secondary analyses of the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes-Blood Pressure (ACCORD-BP) trial. The KDOQI work group agreed with most of the recommendations while highlighting the weak evidence base especially for patients with diabetes and advanced CKD.

### Hypertension and cardiomyopathy associated with chronic kidney disease: epidemiology, pathogenesis and treatment considerations [^1168LakM]. Journal of Human Hypertension (2023). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure target in chronic kidney disease

Prior to publication of the SPRINT trial results, most societies and guidelines recommend lowering blood pressure to below 140/90 mmHg with some suggesting higher thresholds for the elderly and lower thresholds for those at higher high risk including patients with diabetic mellitus and patients with CKD. It is now recognised that more intensive blood pressure reduction strategies are effective and safe. The SPRINT investigators reported a 25% lower risk of major cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction, heart failure and stroke and 27% lower risk of all-cause mortality when treating to a target systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mmHg compared to the standard target of 140 mmHg. This was associated with an increase in complications such as lower serum potassium, sodium, and syncopal episodes, but no increased risk of falls. Treatment of hypertension in those with CKD, which formed 28% of the SPRINT cohort, was associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes and all-cause mortality, with no adverse effects on kidney function or increased risk of dialysis. Elderly patients aged over 75 years old also sustained benefit from more intensive blood pressure control.

These data have resulted in lowering of both American and European blood pressure targets in their respective 2017 and 2018 hypertension guidelines. The recently published Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2021 guideline on the management of blood pressure in CKD also recommends an intensive systolic blood pressure target of 120 mmHg or less in patients with CKD (excluding those with a functioning kidney transplant) with an emphasis on standardised office blood pressure measurement and lifestyle interventions such as salt restriction and moderate-intensity exercise (Fig. 7).

### Blood pressure targets for hypertension in people with chronic renal disease [^116bJBsk]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, development of end-stage renal disease, and all-cause mortality. It affects around 10% of the population worldwide. The prevalence of hypertension in people with CKD ranges from 22% in stage 1 to 80% in stage 4. Elevated arterial blood pressure is one of the major independent risk factors for adverse cardiovascular events. Thereby, reducing blood pressure to below standard targets may be beneficial but could also increase the risk of adverse events. The optimal blood pressure target in people with hypertension and CKD remains unknown.

Objectives

Primary: to compare the effects of standard and lower-than-standard blood pressure targets for hypertension in people with chronic kidney disease on mortality and morbidity outcomes. Secondary: to assess the magnitude of reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, the proportion of participants reaching blood pressure targets, and the number of drugs necessary to achieve the assigned target.

Search Methods

We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. We searched the Cochrane Hypertension Specialized Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, one other database, and two trial registers up to 8 February 2023. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. We applied no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in people with hypertension and CKD that provided at least twelve months' follow-up. Eligible interventions compared lower targets for systolic/diastolic blood pressure (130/80 mmHg or lower) to standard targets for blood pressure (140 to 160/90 to 100 mmHg or lower). Participants were adults with CKD and elevated blood pressure documented in a standard way on at least two occasions, or already receiving treatment for elevated blood pressure.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methods. Our critical outcomes were: total mortality, total serious adverse events, total cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and progression to end-stage renal disease. Important outcomes were: participant withdrawals due to adverse effects, and number of participants with a doubling of serum creatinine level or at least a 50% reduction in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at the end of the study. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for the critical outcomes. This review received no funding.

Main Results

We included six RCTs that contributed data for meta-analysis, involving 7348 participants overall (range 840 to 4733 people per study). The mean follow-up was 3.6 years (range 1.0 to 8.0 years). Three studies were publicly funded, two were privately funded, and one had both public and private funding. All RCTs provided individual participant data. None of the included studies blinded participants or clinicians because of the need to titrate antihypertensive drugs to reach a specific blood pressure target. However, an independent committee blinded to group allocation assessed clinical events in all studies. Critical outcomes. Compared with standard blood pressure targets, lower targets likely result in little to no difference in total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76 to 1.06; 6 studies, 7348 participants), total serious adverse events (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.08; 6 studies, 7348 participants), and total cardiovascular events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.15; 5 studies, 6508 participants), all with moderate-certainty evidence. Compared with standard blood pressure targets, lower targets may result in little to no difference in cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.70 to 1.16; 6 studies, 7348 participants) and progression to end-stage renal disease (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.11; 4 studies, 4788 participants), both with low-certainty evidence. Important outcomes. We found little to no differences in: participant withdrawals due to adverse effects; and the number of participants with a doubling of serum creatinine level, or at least a 50% reduction in GFR at the end of the study. Exploratory outcomes. Compared to the standard blood pressure target groups, participants in the lower target groups achieved lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure values after one year, and required a higher number of antihypertensive drugs at the end of the studies. A higher proportion of participants in the standard blood pressure target groups achieved the targets they were assigned than did participants in the intensive target groups.

Authors' Conclusions

Compared to a standard blood pressure target, lower blood pressure targets probably result in little to no difference in total mortality, total serious adverse events, and total cardiovascular events, and may result in little to no difference in total cardiovascular mortality or in the progression to end-stage renal disease in people with hypertension and CKD. However, the evidence underpinning these conclusions has several limitations. All studies were open design, blood pressure measurement was performed at a medical office, and there was scant information about adverse events. Future research should include high-quality adverse event data, report results for people with different levels of proteinuria, and consider out-of-office blood pressure monitoring. Several studies are ongoing, and may provide new evidence for this topic in the near future.

### Diagnosis and management of non-dialysis chronic kidney disease in ambulatory care: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines [^1113mHLA]. BMC Nephrology (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is age-dependent and has a high prevalence in the general population. Most patients are managed in ambulatory care. This systematic review provides an updated overview of quality and content of international clinical practice guidelines for diagnosis and management of non-dialysis CKD relevant to patients in ambulatory care.

Methods

We identified guidelines published from 2012-to March 2018 in guideline portals, databases and by manual search. Methodological quality was assessed with the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II instrument. Recommendations were extracted and evaluated.

Results

Eight hundred fifty-two publications were identified, 9 of which were eligible guidelines. Methodological quality ranged from 34 to 77%, with domains "scope and purpose" and "clarity of presentation" attaining highest and "applicability" lowest scores. Guidelines were similar in recommendations on CKD definition, screening of patients with diabetes and hypertension, blood pressure targets and referral of patients with progressive or stage G4 CKD. Definition of high risk groups and recommended tests in newly diagnosed CKD varied.

Conclusions

Guidelines quality ranged from moderate to high. Guidelines generally agreed on management of patients with high risk or advanced CKD, but varied in regarding the range of recommended measurements, the need for referrals to nephrology, monitoring intervals and comprehensiveness. More research is needed on efficient management of patients with low risk of CKD progression to end stage renal disease.

### KDOQI clinical practice guidelines and clinical practice recommendations for diabetes and chronic kidney disease [^113cWuMb]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

NKF-KDOQI diabetes and chronic kidney disease — burden and costs note that chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects 11% of the US population, and those affected are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and kidney failure. Kidney failure represents about 1% of prevalent CKD, and the prevalence of kidney failure treated by dialysis or transplantation is projected to increase from 453,000 in 2003 to 651,000 in 2010. In Medicare, the CKD stage 5 population nearly doubled in the last 10 years and, together with the expanded CKD population, they account for 16.5% of Medicare expenditures, nearly double that of the Medicare diabetic population, which now approach 24% of Medicare expenditures. CKD is a worldwide public health problem affecting more than 50 million people, with more than 1 million receiving kidney replacement therapy, and some adverse outcomes of CKD can be prevented or delayed by preventive measures, early detection, and treatment. Existing NKF-KDOQI clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) presently offer strategies to manage hypertension, dyslipidemia, bone disease, anemia, nutrition, and CVD in patients with CKD.

### Revisiting resistant hypertension in kidney disease [^1133PgCn]. Current Opinion in Nephrology and Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

According to 2017 American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines, nearly half of US adults have hypertension (48.1%, 119.9 million) and this prevalence is even higher, approximately 60–90%, in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Hypertension is associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden and mortality as well as poor kidney outcome. Lowering of blood pressure (BP) in patients with CKD results in better CVD and all-cause mortality as well as CKD progression and is a core goal for the treatment in published guidelines. However, only one in four US adults with hypertension have their BP under control for several reasons, including lack of awareness, access to healthy lifestyle, healthcare and medications. Resistant hypertension is a phenomenon that identifies subset of hypertensive patients who have inadequately controlled BP despite intensive treatment with multiple antihypertensive medications and is associated with substantially higher risk of poor outcomes. Due to complex interplay of physiologic factors and more stringent systolic BP (SBP) goals in CKD (ACC/AHA guidelines' target < 130/80 mmHg and 2021 Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes [KDIGO] guidelines' target of < 120 mmHg), the prevalence of resistant hypertension is much higher in CKD and requires increasing involvement of nephrologists to manage this condition. This review discusses the pathophysiology, definition, identification and treatment strategies for resistant hypertension in individuals with CKD.
