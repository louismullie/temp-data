## Question

Treatment options and newest treatments

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about treatment options and the newest treatments across diseases. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to structure the analysis by disease area and evidence hierarchy. Then, I should verify which sources are most authoritative and recent. Next, I will extract key treatment options and explicitly identify what is genuinely new or updated in 2025. After that, I should appraise the strength of evidence and note uncertainties. Finally, I will synthesize cross-cutting themes and provide a concise, clinically oriented summary with citations.

> Let me first confirm the scope and framework so I don't miss anything important. I will organize by major disease domains where 2025 guidelines or high-impact reviews provide actionable updates, including oncology, infectious diseases, chronic respiratory disease, endocrinology/metabolism, neurology, and select surgical or procedural areas, and I will prioritize sources like NCCN, GOLD, ADA, HIV.gov, and peer-reviewed journals that explicitly flag "new" or "updated" content in 2025 [^8b93bd89] [^601f56c6] [^6f764b5d] [^56f1e754].

> I need to check which sources truly represent the newest guidance. The 2025 NCCN Breast Cancer Insights, 2025 GOLD COPD Strategy, 2025 ADA Standards of Care, and 2025 HIV.gov ART guidance are primary, with additional 2025 updates from ESMO melanoma, ASCO ovarian cancer, and CUA/CUOG prostate cancer guidelines, which collectively capture the most current, guideline-level changes clinicians will encounter [^8b93bd89] [^601f56c6] [^6f764b5d] [^56f1e754] [^5567f6d9] [^d5d6c567] [^3ab2ba81].

> Now, let me consider oncology first, and I should double-check what is genuinely new versus iterative. In breast cancer, NCCN continues to emphasize trial participation and individualized selection among complex options, but there is no single "new" 2025 drug approval highlighted in these guideline summaries, so I should avoid overclaiming novelty here [^8b93bd89]. In melanoma, ESMO 2025 formalizes neoadjuvant nivolumab–ipilimumab or pembrolizumab-based strategies for resectable stage III disease and details second-line systemic choices, reflecting maturation of immunotherapy sequencing rather than a brand-new agent launch [^5567f6d9] [^95b6767d] [^b8777779]. In prostate cancer, multiple 2025 guidelines converge on intensified upfront therapy, including darolutamide plus ADT with or without docetaxel, and recommend immediate ADT with antiandrogen flare prophylaxis in symptomatic metastatic disease, which operationalizes recent evidence rather than introducing a novel class [^3ab2ba81] [^005a4698] [^118e0925] [^82b28cf5] [^a734527f]. In ovarian cancer, ASCO 2025 updates endorse neoadjuvant chemotherapy for high perioperative risk and maintenance strategies with bevacizumab or PARP inhibitors, again consolidating existing paradigms [^afc64166] [^d5d6c567]. In bone sarcomas, NCCN adds consideration of comprehensive genomic profiling to identify targeted options in high TMB tumors and expands radiotherapy techniques for metastases, including radium-223 and SBRT, which are meaningful additions even if not entirely new molecules [^dd44d3d6] [^29c2462a] [^542b3304]. For gastric cancer, ASTRO highlights evolving roles for radiotherapy integrated with perioperative immunotherapy, citing MATTERHORN's signal for improved pCR and EFS, indicating practice shift rather than a new drug approval [^3a30b820]. In brain metastases, emerging guidance supports immune checkpoint inhibitors with or without radiotherapy to improve survival and local control in select breast cancer patients, which is a notable therapeutic expansion [^2c4d3c6f].

> Hold on, I should verify infectious disease updates next, especially HIV, where long-acting therapies are reshaping care. Lenacapavir, a first-in-class capsid inhibitor dosed every 26 weeks, is now available and represents a major innovation for treatment-experienced patients with multidrug resistance, while long-acting injectables like cabotegravir/rilpivirine are endorsed for adolescents and adults meeting criteria, and rapid ART initiation is reinforced to improve suppression and retention, with specific guidance for early HIV and pregnancy planning [^29d53977] [^a5ebf03a] [^56f1e754] [^b9f8a301] [^69fbf3ff] [^9c87552a]. For influenza, pediatric guidance emphasizes the need for new antivirals and better data in hospitalized children, reflecting ongoing gaps rather than newly approved pediatric agents in 2025 [^fb0f7928].

> Next, I should review chronic respiratory disease, and I need to ensure I capture the novel inhaled therapy. GOLD 2025 introduces ensifentrine, a first-in-class inhaled dual PDE3/PDE4 inhibitor, as a new option for stable COPD, particularly when added to LABA/LAMA in patients with persistent symptoms, and it refines device selection and follow-up algorithms to optimize adherence and outcomes, which is a concrete therapeutic addition clinicians can use [^e91db23c] [^79cd5051] [^a1e9c119] [^0d7e1895].

> I will now examine endocrinology and metabolism, and I should confirm which updates are truly 2025. The ADA Standards add a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (finerenone class) for type 2 diabetes with CKD and albuminuria on maximally tolerated ACEi/ARB, and they advise continuing weight-management pharmacotherapy chronically to maintain benefits, while also cautioning against compounded products during shortages, which are important practice changes for 2025 [^778dca62] [^1c9e5e60] [^6f764b5d]. For hypoparathyroidism, palopegteriparatide, a long-acting PTH analog, is newly available and offers a more physiologic alternative to calcium and active vitamin D, with additional agents like eneboparatide and calcilytics in phase 3, signaling a shift toward PTH replacement strategies [^945ffe01].

> Let me consider neurology, and I should be careful not to overstate approvals. Donanemab for early symptomatic Alzheimer disease is now available, but eligibility should not be based solely on blood biomarkers until FDA-cleared tests exist, reinforcing the need for PET- or CSF-confirmed amyloid positivity and careful patient selection, which is a key 2025 implementation nuance [^791b04eb]. In MS, while the field celebrates disease-modifying progress, the cited review frames future directions rather than listing 2025-specific new approvals, so I should avoid claiming new DMT launches here [^94cb1220]. For cavernous malformations, low-dose propranolol is noted as safe but with uncertain long-term efficacy, reflecting evolving off-label use rather than a new indication [^b0b0920d].

> But wait, what about emerging cross-cutting modalities that aren't disease-specific? I should double-check targeted radionuclide therapy and drug–radiotherapy combinations. High-level reviews emphasize TRT as a transformative, rapidly expanding class with new targets and radiopharmaceuticals, and early-phase drug–radiotherapy trials are proliferating, though many remain investigational and not yet standard of care, so I need to flag these as promising frontiers rather than established 2025 standards [^71cc0088] [^42dabc4a].

> I should confirm pediatric and rare disease signals as well. In pediatric AML, ongoing work in precision medicine, immunotherapy, and novel agents is highlighted, indicating pipeline momentum rather than a 2025-approved breakthrough in this summary set [^a6d83528]. In systemic sclerosis, CAR-T19 is being explored as a potential disease-modifying strategy targeting B cells, but this remains investigational and should not be misconstrued as current standard therapy [^57781ba0].

> Next, I should review the strength of evidence and grading so I don't overgeneralize. Many oncology recommendations are based on randomized trials and meta-analyses but still carry NCCN category 2A or ESMO strength grades, reflecting consensus and indirect evidence, whereas GOLD and ADA statements often carry Evidence A or AI ratings for core pharmacotherapies, and HIV guidance frequently uses AI/AII for ART initiation principles, which helps calibrate confidence when advising patients [^8b93bd89] [^5567f6d9] [^601f56c6] [^56f1e754].

> Hold on, I should verify cross-cutting themes that tie these updates together. Across diseases, there is a push toward intensified upfront combination therapy, personalization by biomarkers or risk stratification, expansion of long-acting or less frequent dosing to improve adherence, and explicit emphasis on shared decision-making and equitable access, including special populations such as pediatrics, pregnancy, and older adults, which are repeatedly emphasized in HIV, oncology, and chronic disease guidelines [^56f1e754] [^8b93bd89] [^601f56c6].

> Let me synthesize the genuinely "newest" treatments and practice changes for 2025 that clinicians will actually encounter. Ensifentrine for COPD is a clear new pharmacologic option with GOLD endorsement, lenacapavir expands long-acting HIV therapy for heavily treatment-experienced patients, palopegteriparatide offers a new PTH replacement for hypoparathyroidism, donanemab is available for early Alzheimer disease with biomarker caveats, and multiple oncology guidelines codify intensified upfront regimens and neoadjuvant immunotherapy strategies that, while not brand-new molecules, represent updated standards clinicians should adopt [^e91db23c] [^29d53977] [^945ffe01] [^791b04eb] [^3ab2ba81] [^5567f6d9].

> Finally, I need to ensure the practical takeaways are explicit. Clinicians should prioritize guideline-concordant care, screen for eligibility for new options like ensifentrine, lenacapavir, palopegteriparatide, and donanemab, consider clinical trials for patients with limited standard options, and use shared decision-making to align choices with patient preferences, comorbidities, and access constraints, recognizing that many "newest" advances are refinements of existing classes rather than entirely new drug classes [^8b93bd89] [^601f56c6] [^56f1e754].

## Challenges and considerations

Despite these advances, **key challenges remain**:

- **Access and affordability**: High costs and healthcare disparities limit access to novel therapies, particularly in underserved populations [^b01c9559].

- **Long-term safety**: Ongoing monitoring is essential to assess delayed adverse effects, particularly for gene and cell therapies [^notfound].

- **Regulatory hurdles**: Streamlined approval processes and international collaboration are needed to accelerate access while ensuring safety [^60d5af13].

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^e30f9438]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Breast cancer — care planning summary: The therapeutic options for patients with noninvasive or invasive breast cancer are complex and varied, and in many situations, the patient and physician have the responsibility to jointly explore and select the most appropriate option from among the available alternatives. With few exceptions, the evaluation, treatment, and follow-up recommendations in these guidelines are based on the results of past and present clinical trials. However, there is not a single clinical situation in which the treatment of breast cancer has been optimized with respect to either maximizing cure or minimizing toxicity and disfigurement. Therefore, patient/physician participation in prospective clinical trials allows patients to not only receive state-of-the-art cancer treatment but also to contribute to improving the treatment outcomes.

### A fast path from innovation to safe and effective medicines [^60d5af13]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Consistent progress in medicines development has allowed both for de novo treatment options and for the refinement of existing products that improve effectiveness or reduce harm. Nonetheless, unmet medical needs persist, particularly in rare diseases, pediatrics and underserved populations. The many promises of pharmacological, technological, and regulatory innovation spark new hope for patients and doctors searching for treatments, and it is therefore essential that progress made translates into the availability of new and improved medicines. We here present our vision for accelerating the path from innovation to safe and effective medicines. Our vision is driven by the continued and transparent collaboration between regulators, academia, industry, patients, and healthcare professionals. Through concrete examples and strategic initiatives, we illustrate how the EMA works with stakeholders to support continuous evolution of regulatory science, contribute to patient‐focused refinements in evidence generation and medicines assessments, and engage in forward‐looking initiatives that monitor and examine innovative developments. The ultimate goal is to future‐proof the regulatory ecosystem and ensure that scientific progress translates into meaningful health outcomes.

### The molecular blueprint of targeted radionuclide therapy [^71cc0088]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) is a cutting-edge treatment approach in oncology that combines the molecular precision of targeted agents with the effect of radiotherapy to selectively deliver cytotoxic radiation to cancer cells. Research efforts from the past few decades have led to a diverse molecular landscape of TRT and have provided lessons for further rational development of targeted radiopharmaceuticals and expansion of the clinical applications of this treatment modality. In this Review, we discuss TRT in the context of therapeutic approaches currently available in oncology, describe the broad range of established and emerging targets for TRT including innovative approaches to exploit vulnerabilities presented by the tumour microenvironment, and address the challenges for clinical translation and molecular optimization. By bridging technological innovation and preclinical discoveries with real-world clinical implementation, ongoing research on TRT is seeking to provide effective and safe treatment options for patients across a variety of cancer types and treatment settings. Overall, we emphasize the transformative potential of TRT and highlight how a comprehensive understanding of what constitutes an optimal target can redefine clinical practice, fostering the evolution of TRT as a highly individualized and adaptable therapeutic option that improves outcomes across a broad range of cancer types.

### Innovative, early-phase clinical trials of drug-radiotherapy combinations [^42dabc4a]. The Lancet: Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Over the past few decades, breakthroughs in cancer biology at the molecular level have revolutionised cancer treatment. Enhanced precision in radiotherapy has not only reduced patient side-effects, but also enabled the delivery of high-dose stereotactic extracranial irradiation with unprecedented accuracy. Simultaneously, the number of medical therapies available for clinical care continues to grow. Despite the progress made with combined chemoradiotherapy, only a few drug-radiotherapy combinations have received clinical approval, leaving a vast landscape of untapped opportunities for basic, translational, and clinical research, particularly in early-phase drug-radiotherapy trials. New and promising pharmaceutical therapies, paired with advanced radiotherapy technologies, are now being tested in innovative clinical trial designs. Moreover, the integration of biological and imaging markers-both tumour-specific and peripheral-holds the potential to personalise drug-radiotherapy combinations, thereby enhancing the therapeutic index for specific patient populations. In this Review, we highlight the latest developments and future directions for early-phase clinical trials that combine precision drug-radiotherapy strategies in adult patients, with the aims of improving outcomes and expanding treatment options.

### Hepatorenal syndrome: updates on definition, classification, pathophysiology and treatment options [^41fbee52]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) is a severe complication of advanced liver disease, characterized by renal dysfunction in the absence of intrinsic kidney disease. It is associated with high mortality, necessitating early recognition and prompt treatment. In this review, we summarize the latest in pathophysiology, diagnosis, classification and treatment of hepatorenal syndrome relevant to a consulting interventional radiologist. The diagnosis and classification of HRS has recently been updated by the International Club of Ascites (ICA) and kidney disease improving global outcomes (KDIGO) to include more subcategories that better reflect disease severity and prognosis. Greater insights have also been obtained into the pathophysiology of HRS, currently understood to be a complex manifestation of hemodynamic disturbances due to portal hypertension, systemic inflammation, oxidative stress, and biliary injury. We discuss the role of laboratory biomarkers in diagnosis and prognosis along with associated pitfalls. Treatment options are reviewed starting with first line medical management, adjunctive renal replacement therapy, and liver transplantation. Finally, we review the evidence to date investigating transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creation in this population, focusing on expected efficacy for specific subpopulations and current gaps in knowledge, all driving practical recommendations for when the procedure should be considered.

### Exploring new horizons in neovascular age-related macular degeneration: novel mechanisms of action and future therapeutic avenues [^c42f548e]. Eye (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion, nAMD continues to present a substantial global health challenge with a growing prevalence projected for the future. The advent of IVT administered anti-VEGF agents marked a breakthrough, significantly improving outcomes compared to previous modalities. However, the current standard of care for nAMD poses the previously mentioned practical limitations and efficacy issues.

The pursuit of therapies that address the multifaceted challenges of nAMD remains crucial. The development of longer-lasting drugs, gene therapy, and alternative pathways reflects a shift towards enhancing patient satisfaction and compliance and reducing the overall management burden associated with nAMD. While the investigational landscape for nAMD is promising (Table 2), it is essential to acknowledge the high standard set by current anti-VEGF therapies. Future advancements should aim not only for equivalent or superior efficacy but also for improved safety, tolerability, and convenience. The complexity of nAMD pathogenesis demands a multifaceted approach, and ongoing research holds the potential to redefine the treatment paradigm for this visually debilitating condition.

### Recommendations for prevention and control of influenza in children, 2025–2026: technical report [^fb0f7928]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Influenza antiviral treatment in children — research and access needs are emphasized: new antiviral drugs are in various development phases, given the need to improve options for the treatment and chemoprophylaxis of influenza. With limited data on the use of antivirals in hospitalized children and in children with underlying medical conditions, prospective clinical trials to inform optimal timing and efficacy of antiviral treatment in these populations are warranted, particularly as new antivirals or new indications for existing antivirals become available. Barriers to timely treatment of children at high risk for complications, especially hospitalized patients, must be explored.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^601f56c6]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Prevention and management of COPD — treatment goals and pharmacotherapy: The main treatment goals are to reduce symptoms and future risk of exacerbations, and the management strategy of stable COPD should be predominantly based on the assessment of symptoms and the history of exacerbations. Pharmacotherapy can reduce COPD symptoms, reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations, and improve health status and exercise tolerance, and data suggest beneficial effects on rates of lung function decline and mortality. Each pharmacological treatment regimen should be individualized and guided by the severity of symptoms, risk of exacerbations, side-effects, comorbidities, drug availability and cost, and the patient's response, preference, and ability to use various drug delivery devices, and inhaler technique needs to be assessed regularly.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^812e9e3a]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

HIV-2 infection — treatment guidance: To date, no randomized controlled trials that address when to start antiretroviral therapy (ART) or the choice of initial or subsequent ART for HIV-2 have been reported, and thus the optimal treatment strategy has not been defined. Existing data and extrapolation from HIV-1 indicate that ART should be started at or soon after HIV-2 diagnosis to prevent disease progression and transmission of HIV-2 to others (AIII). CD4 cell recovery in people with HIV-2 who are on ART is generally poorer than that observed in people with HIV-1.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^0fc57be8]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Introduction — antiretroviral therapy benefits and viral suppression: Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has dramatically reduced HIV-associated morbidity and mortality, has transformed HIV infection into a manageable chronic condition with life expectancy approaching that for people without HIV, and is highly effective at preventing sexual transmission in patients with adequately suppressed viral loads; lack of viral load suppression is mostly due to undiagnosed HIV infection and failure to link or retain patients with HIV in care.

### Principles for novel neurologic therapeutics: an AAN position statement [^8f2da481]. Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Principles for novel neurologic therapeutics — The statement provides guiding principles for the American Academy of Neurology's (AAN) approach when evidence is limited or there is no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved indication, and it does not provide clinical recommendations; the AAN recommends an approach in which the patient and neurologist carefully review all available evidence and discuss the potential risks and benefits of the therapy, including when patients are contemplating asserting their right to try. FDA review and approval remain the gold standard supporting the introduction and continued use of therapeutics for neurologic diseases, and potential novel treatments that have not been approved or even reviewed by the FDA may emerge from different sources, including government coordination-supported basic, translational, and clinical research; industry-sponsored investigations; patient advocacy groups; traditional medicines used in indigenous cultures; and other substances or approaches with variable levels of evidence favoring their possible roles as treatments or evaluating their risks. The underlying tenets include the critical role of high-quality evidence and the importance of the relationship between the patient and physician to inform decision making related to any contemplated therapy.

### New horizons in systemic sclerosis treatment: advances and emerging therapies in 2025 [^57781ba0]. RMD Open (2025). Medium credibility.

Methodology and literature search

This manuscript was developed as a narrative review with the objective of providing a comprehensive and clinically relevant synthesis of current organ-based management strategies and emerging therapeutic approaches in SSc. To inform the review, a targeted literature search was conducted in PubMed/MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and the proceedings of major international rheumatology congresses (EULAR, ACR) up to April 2025. Search terms included combinations of: "systemic sclerosis", "scleroderma", "interstitial lung disease", "pulmonary arterial hypertension", "Raynaud's phenomenon", "digital ulcers", "renal crisis", "gastrointestinal involvement", "skin fibrosis", "emerging therapies", "clinical trials" and "precision medicine".

Priority was given to phase II–III clinical trials, recent international guidelines (including the 2023 EULAR recommendations), and ongoing trials investigating novel therapeutic targets in SSc. Foundational or landmark studies published prior to this time frame were also included where they remain essential to guiding current clinical practice. Additional references were identified through citation chaining and based on the authors' expertise in SSc clinical care and research.

Emerging therapies and novel therapies in SSc

Current treatment approaches largely focus on managing individual organ manifestations — targeting inflammation, fibrosis and vascular dysfunction — rather than addressing the underlying disease mechanisms. Despite advances in immunosuppressive and antifibrotic therapies, the absence of truly disease-modifying treatments capable of altering the disease trajectory highlights a critical gap in care. Table 1 represents emerging and novel therapies in SSc.

Table 1
Emerging therapies in SSc

Given the pivotal role of B cells in SSc, chimeric antigen receptor T-cell (CAR-T19) therapy — a groundbreaking treatment originally developed for haematological malignancies — has emerged as a potential game-changer for autoimmune diseases, including SSc. CAR-T19 therapy selectively targets and depletes CD19+B cells, offering a more profound and potentially long-lasting immunomodulatory effect compared with conventional B-cell depletion therapies like RTX.

### Recent pathophysiological insights are advancing the treatment of venous thromboembolism [^6cc6a640]. JACC: Basic to Translational Science (2025). Medium credibility.

Concluding Remarks and Future Perspectives

Anticoagulation therapy continues to remain the standard of care for the treatment and prevention of thrombosis in VTE patients with the hope of better safety and efficacy through the development of factor XI inhibitors. Emerging thrombolytic approaches, including antagonists of fibrinolysis inhibitors, may offer improved safety and efficacy profiles in the dissolution of acute venous thromboemboli to further reduce long-term complications such as PTS, postpulmonary embolism impairment, and CTEPH, that occur despite anticoagulation. Advancements in preclinical animal models are illuminating basic mechanisms and leading to innovative composition- and time-based treatment approaches for VTE patients. More research insights are needed into the mechanisms responsible for the acute-to-chronic transition of venous thrombi to support treatment innovations that are appropriately targeted to thrombus age.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^a1e9c119]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) inhaler device choice — selection process and shared decision-making states that if a patient is currently taking inhaled therapy and able to use their current device correctly, new therapy is best prescribed in the same device. If a new device is required, either because the patient is not using their current device correctly or the drug is not available in the same device, a systematic iterative process should be used to select a delivery system and ensure the patient can use it. The choice of an inhaler device depends on drug availability, characteristics of the device, the patient's abilities and preferences, and the knowledge of healthcare professionals caring for the patient about devices and their correct usage. The final choice should be made jointly by the prescriber and the patient using a shared decision-making approach. Patients' beliefs, satisfaction with current and previous devices and preferences need to be assessed and considered. The number of different device types should be minimized for each patient, and device type should not be switched in the absence of clinical justification nor without proper information, education and medical follow-up. Physicians should prescribe only devices they (and the other members of the caring team) know how to use.

### Promising targeted therapies for hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis: a translational perspective based on immunopathology [^131bfaa4]. Clinical Reviews in Allergy & Immunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a severe and life-threatening hyperinflammatory disorder characterized by dysregulated immune activation, primarily driven by excessive stimulation of cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) and macrophages. This uncontrolled immune response leads to cytokine-induced tissue damage and multiorgan dysfunction. HLH presents a significant clinical challenge due to its rapid progression and high mortality rate. In adult patients, current first-line treatment strategies, adapted from pediatric protocols such as HLH-94 and HLH-2004, achieve complete disease resolution in only approximately 50% of cases. The urgent need for more effective therapeutic options is underscored by the lack of targeted treatments and the persistent high mortality associated with HLH. However, the pathophysiology of HLH remains complex and incompletely understood, involving multiple immune dysregulations, diverse etiologies, and variable clinical presentations, making drug development particularly challenging. Drawing from recent advancements, this review provides a translational perspective on the immunopathological mechanisms underlying HLH, highlighting emerging therapeutic targets and novel treatments currently under clinical investigation. By synthesizing these insights, we aim to identify key opportunities for the development of innovative therapies to improve patient outcomes.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^221e5ca5]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Multidrug resistance without fully active commonly used ARV drug options — "Maximal virologic suppression should remain the goal; however, if it cannot be achieved, the goals of ART will be to preserve immunologic function, prevent clinical progression, and minimize the development of further resistance that may compromise future regimens".

### Lenacapavir: playing the long game in the new era of antiretrovirals [^29d53977]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2025). Medium credibility.

Nearly 39 million people live with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) globally. Treatment for HIV, termed antiretroviral therapy (ART), has significantly improved the quality of life, health, and life expectancy for people with HIV (PWH). ART is recommended for all PWH and should be started rapidly following diagnosis to prevent HIV‐associated morbidity and mortality and to prevent HIV transmission by suppressing plasma HIV‐1 RNA below quantifiable limits of detection. ART is highly effective in suppressing and maintaining undetectable plasma HIV‐1 RNA levels, but adherence to the prescribed ART regimen is crucial to its effectiveness.

Generally, high adherence rates – usually 90% or greater – are necessary for sustaining viral suppression. However, a recent retrospective study demonstrated that over 40% of PWH in the United States report adherence below 80% over the previous 12 months. The consequences of nonadherence include the risk of HIV transmission, treatment resistance, and the emergence of HIV‐associated negative health effects.

Emerging options to address nonadherence are long‐acting injectable (LAI) formulations of antiretrovirals (ARVs).LAIs are administered via non‐oral extravascular routes, such as intramuscular (IM) and subcutaneous (SC) injections. Accompanying these routes of administration is unique pharmacokinetic (PK) properties that permit less frequent dosing schedules on the orders of weeks or months vs. daily dosing with conventional oral ART.

Exemplifying this evolution of ART is lenacapavir (LEN), a first‐in‐class capsid inhibitor dosed subcutaneously every 26 weeks. In this review of LEN, we discuss the preclinical and clinical studies supporting its approval, unique clinical pharmacology profile, current ongoing studies for treatment and prevention, pharmacologic research gaps, and concluding thoughts.

Pediatric acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous and aggressive hematological malignancy. Despite advances in treatment, the survival rates remain unsatisfactory, emphasizing the need for innovative therapeutic approaches. This narrative review presents a comprehensive overview of the current approach and likely future directions for pediatric AML. The distinct genetic, epigenetic, and molecular features of pediatric AML contribute to its complex pathophysiology and impact on prognosis. Current treatment practices involve a multifaceted approach combining chemotherapy, molecularly targeted therapies, and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. However, intensive treatment often leads to significant acute and long-term toxicity. Emerging strategies, including precision medicine, immunotherapy, and novel agents, hold promise for improving outcomes and minimizing adverse effects. Ongoing clinical trials are investigating the potential of these innovative approaches to transform pediatric AML care. By highlighting the evolving treatment paradigms and future perspectives, this review underscores the importance of continued research and development in pediatric AML to enhance the survival rates and quality of life of these young patients.

### New insights in the treatment of DKD: recent advances and future prospects [^5a685905]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Diabetes represents a significant global public health concern, with its prevalence steadily rising each year. According to the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), it is observed that by 2021, diabetes will affect 10.5% of the adult population worldwide, a figure that is anticipated to increase to 12.2% by the year 2045. DKD is a prevalent complication of diabetes, with approximately 40% of individuals with diabetes developing DKD. DKD is the primary etiology of ESKD in diabetic patients, accounting for 30–50% of ESKD cases globally. In the context of chronic kidney disease (CKD) burden, DKD represents approximately one third of cases. DKD not only poses a significant threat to public health, but also has implications for economic growth and development. In recent years, advancements in the understanding of the pathogenesis of DKD have led to the emergence of several new diabetes medications that have demonstrated promising efficacy in clinical settings. Consequently, the protective effects of these medications on kidney function and their underlying molecular mechanisms have garnered increasing attention in research. This review explores the pharmacological treatments currently employed in the management of DKD, elucidating their respective mechanisms of action. Additionally, potential strategies and therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of DKD that are currently undergoing investigation are discussed. The objective is to provide insights for early intervention through therapeutic combinations, with the potential to decelerate the progression of kidney disease.

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^05ddfb0d]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) group E — initial pharmacologic therapy favors dual bronchodilation, as LABA+LAMA is the preferred choice for initial therapy in group E patients provided there are no issues regarding availability, cost and side-effects. Use of LABA+ICS in COPD is not encouraged; if there is an indication for an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), then LABA+LAMA+ICS has been shown to be superior to LABA+ICS and is therefore the preferred choice. Consider LABA+LAMA+ICS in group E if eos ≥ 300 cells/μL (practical recommendation); although there are no direct data on initiating triple therapy in newly diagnosed patients, available studies performed mostly in treated patients provide a rationale for considering this option for patients with a high eosinophil count (≥ 300 cells/μL).

### Increasing access to antiretroviral therapy for the prevention and treatment of HIV in infants, children, and youth in the United States: policy statement [^20f6d2b0]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Priority 1 — optimal ARVs for neonatal and infant HIV prophylaxis and treatment — emphasizes limited options and complex prescribing. Most ARV use in neonates in the United States is for prevention of perinatal transmission of HIV, and high-risk perinatal exposures require multiple ARVs as prophylaxis or treatment. A limited number of ARVs are available for prophylaxis and treatment of HIV in neonates and infants. Practical challenges include rapid weight change necessitating frequent dosing changes and visits, limited neonatal dosing information, and that for some ARVs dosing is based on pharmacokinetic modeling studies. Some ARVs recommended by the World Health Organization may be off-label in the United States, and neonatal and infant HIV treatment may be complex and require expert consultation for prescribing optimal antiretroviral therapy (ART). Notably, because zidovudine is currently the only ARV with safety and dosing information for infants born before 30 weeks' gestation, there is inadequate safety and dosing information to inform a recommendation for a 2- or 3-drug regimen for extremely preterm neonates with high-risk HIV exposures.

Bronchodilator initiation and combination therapy in stable COPD — treatment selection and escalation are as follows: When initiating treatment with long acting bronchodilators the preferred choice is a combination of a LABA and a LAMA. In patients with persistent dyspnea on a single long-acting bronchodilator treatment should be escalated to two (Evidence A). Combination treatment with a LABA and a LAMA increases FEV₁ and reduces symptoms compared to monotherapy (Evidence A), and combination treatment with a LABA+LAMA reduces exacerbations compared to monotherapy (Evidence B). Combinations can be given as single inhaler or multiple inhaler treatment, and single inhaler therapy may be more convenient and effective than multiple inhalers.

### The urgent need for breakthrough therapies and a world without type 1 diabetes [^072f8434]. Diabetes Therapy (2025). Medium credibility.

Decades of research and innovation have made T1D increasingly manageable for the 2 million Americans and more than 9 million people globally who are living with T1D. However, T1D continues to impose a relentless physical and emotional burden. As the incidence of T1D increases worldwide, we cannot stop our march toward overcoming it. While we celebrate yesterday's progress, we must strive for more. A longer life, on its own, is not the final destination on the road to breaking through T1D.

We envision a world without T1D, where the disease progression is permanently disrupted, insulin independence is restored, and those with the disease lead lives indistinguishable from those without. Achieving this requires re-examining and evolving our current paradigms as well as continuing collaborations across the T1D community. Researchers, clinicians, patients, advocates, sponsors, and policymakers must all work together to accelerate breakthrough progress toward cures.

Management of virologic failure on modern regimens — genotyping and regimen resumption: When facing ART regimens failing to suppress viremia, "clinicians should order a genotype test to assess for drug resistance that might warrant a regimen change". Given that many regimens containing dolutegravir or bictegravir have a high resistance barrier, "resuming the most recent regimen will have high rates of virologic suppression, provided adherence is good", and therefore "resuming these treatments if people are amenable is recommended, even before the results of the resistance genotype test have been returned (evidence rating: AIIa)".

### NCCN guidelines® insights: testicular cancer, version 2.2025 [^3279a6dc]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

NCCN Guidelines — testicular germ cell tumors (GCTs) overview — Testicular GCTs are sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy and patients have high cure rates even with metastatic disease. Although the majority of metastatic testicular GCTs are cured with chemotherapy, 20% to 30% of patients will relapse after first-line chemotherapy and require additional treatment strategies. The ongoing international phase III TIGER trial aims to determine whether high-dose or conventional-dose chemotherapy is more effective in the second-line setting for patients with relapsed disease. Patients with platinum-refractory or relapsing tumors after second-line therapy have very poor outcomes despite subsequent-line treatments with no effective alternative therapies. Targeted therapies appear to have limited activity in this setting, and prognosis for patients with brain metastases remains poor. Therefore, the NCCN Panel encourages patients with metastatic, recurrent, or platinum-refractory testicular GCTs to participate in well-designed clinical trials investigating novel therapeutic strategies.

### Terazosin hydrochloride [^adb4d3d7]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment options for BPH

There are three main treatment options for BPH:

Program of monitoring or "Watchful Waiting". Some men have an enlarged prostate gland, but no symptoms, or symptoms that are not bothersome. If this applies, you and your doctor may decide on a program of monitoring including regular checkups, instead of medication or surgery.
Medication. There are different kinds of medication used to treat BPH. Your doctor has prescribed Terazosin Capsules for you. See "What Terazosin Capsules do to treat BPH" below.
Surgery. Some patients may need surgery. Your doctor can describe several different surgical procedures to treat BPH. Which procedure is best depends on your symptoms and medical condition.

What Terazosin Capsules do to treat BPH

Terazosin Capsules relax the tightness of a certain type of muscle in the prostate and at the opening of the bladder. This may increase the rate of urine flow and/or decrease the symptoms you are having.

Terazosin Capsules help relieve the symptoms of BPH. It does NOT change the size of the prostate, which may continue to grow. However, a larger prostate does not necessarily cause more or worse symptoms.
If Terazosin Capsules are helping you, you should notice an effect on your particular symptoms in 2 to 4 weeks of starting to take the medication.
Even though you take Terazosin Capsules and they may help you, Terazosin Capsules may not prevent the need for surgery in the future.

ART initiation timing and addressing reluctance — while delaying the initiation of ART is rarely indicated, some people may not be comfortable starting right away, and people expressing reluctance to initiate ART should be engaged to understand and overcome barriers to initiation. Although homelessness, substance use, and mental health problems are associated with poorer adherence, they are not predictive enough at the individual level to warrant withholding or delaying therapy given the simplicity, potency, and tolerability of contemporary ART; rapid ART initiation at the time of HIV diagnosis has been pursued to increase viral load suppression and retention in care, but safety data, intermediate or long-term outcomes, and randomized controlled trial data in high-resource settings are currently lacking.

### Academy of orthopaedic surgeons clinical practice guideline summary: management of acute isolated meniscal pathology [^7b9e75c6]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2025). High credibility.

Acute isolated meniscal pathology — advanced imaging considerations state that value to identify acute meniscal pathology will aid in accurate and appropriate treatment. Regarding cost effectiveness/resource utilization, recent cost and accessibility of MRI has allowed for reasonable cost associated with this advanced modality compared to other forms of advanced imaging, and more cost-effective treatment including ultrasound and CT scan are acceptable options. In terms of acceptability, MRI and other forms of advanced imaging are readily available and accessible to most modern medical communities, while ultrasound and CT scan may be more accessible in rural or underserved areas and are acceptable options. For feasibility, advanced imaging modalities are feasible, however, arthrography may be out of favor with routine assessment of acute meniscal pathology due to its invasiveness. Future research notes that abundant high-quality studies are available on this topic, and future research may focus on value based imaging modalities and minimizing risks.

### Radiation therapy for WHO grade 4 adult-type diffuse glioma: an ASTRO clinical practice guideline [^f8009a27]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions and future directions for WHO grade 4 diffuse glioma — The guideline notes that WHO grade 4 diffuse glioma remains one of the most challenging malignancies to treat, with a complex clinical course and limited survival, and underscores a multidisciplinary approach combining advanced surgical techniques, radiation therapy (RT), systemic therapy, alternating electric field therapy, and supportive care, alongside molecularly guided diagnoses, individualized image-guided RT planning and delivery, and patient-specific factors such as age and performance status (PS) guiding treatment recommendations. It states that tailored management of IDH-mutant WHO grade 4 tumors and other molecular WHO grade 4 diffuse glioma was beyond the scope, that circulating tumor DNA is emerging to better inform treatment and surveillance, that enrolling eligible patients in clinical trials focused on novel therapies and experimental RT techniques remains crucial, and that data on smaller margin expansions are not mature enough to include. Ongoing trials may address the use of protons versus photons (NCT02179086), management of molecular glioblastoma (GBM) (NCT04623931), and management of MGMT methylated GBM (NCT05095376) versus unmethylated GBM (RT sensitizers) (NCT03907447).

### ACG clinical guideline: management of Crohn's disease in adults [^66cdaf04]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Crohn's disease refractory therapy and precision medicine — nonresponse rates, alternative classes, monitoring, and strategic priorities: Despite existing treatments, approximately 20%–30% of patients experience primary nonresponse to anti-TNF therapies, and 30%–40% lose their response or become intolerant (secondary non-responders) within the first year of treatment. These secondary non-responders often require dose escalation, switching to another anti-TNF agent, or transitioning to a different therapeutic class, such as anti-integrins (vedolizumab), anti-IL-12/23 agents (ustekinumab), anti-IL-23 agents (guselkumab, mirikizumab or risankizumab), JAK inhibitors (upadacitinib), or novel mechanisms. Managing patients with refractory CD poses a considerable challenge because they often cycle through the available advanced therapies, and a therapeutic ceiling effect has been observed in some patients, limiting the efficacy of existing treatments. Routine monitoring of disease activity with biomarkers such as fecal calprotectin (FC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is recommended. Precision medicine is emerging as a solution for CD, seeking to integrate prognostic and predictive biomarkers into clinical decision-making, and key proposals to improve CD treatment strategies include the following: Disease Classification; Endpoints; and Longitudinal Assessment.

What is an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA)?

The United States FDA has made GOHIBIC available under an emergency access mechanism called an EUA. The EUA is supported by a Secretary of Health and Human Service (HHS) declaration that circumstances exist to justify the emergency use of drugs and biological products during the COVID-19 pandemic.

GOHIBIC, as a treatment for COVID-19 has not undergone the same type of review as an FDA-approved product for this indication. The FDA may issue an EUA when certain criteria are met, which includes that there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. In addition, the FDA decision is based on the totality of scientific evidence available showing that it is reasonable to believe that the product meets certain criteria for safety, performance, and labeling and may be effective in treatment of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

All of these criteria must be met to allow for the product to be used in the treatment of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The EUA for GOHIBIC as a treatment for certain people with COVID-19 is in effect for the duration of the COVID-19 declaration justifying emergency use of this product, unless terminated or revoked (after which the products may no longer be used under the EUA).

### Piroxicam [^b3fcd723]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of piroxicam and other treatment options before deciding to use piroxicam. Use the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals [see Warnings and Precautions (5)].

After observing the response to initial therapy with piroxicam, the dose and frequency should be adjusted to suit an individual patient's needs.

For the relief of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, the dosage is 20 mg given orally once per day. If desired, the daily dose may be divided. Because of the long half-life of piroxicam, steady-state blood levels are not reached for 7 to 12 days. Therefore, although the therapeutic effects of piroxicam are evident early in treatment, there is a progressive increase in response over several weeks and the effect of therapy should not be assessed for two weeks.

Use the lowest effective dosage for shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (2)
OA and RA: 20 mg once daily (2)

### Global strategy for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2025 report) [^3c8f4211]. GOLD (2025). High credibility.

Therapeutic interventions that reduce COPD mortality — chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of death worldwide, causing 3.23 million deaths in 2019, and a large clinical database study indicates the highest magnitude of risk of all-cause mortality, COPD- and CVD-related mortality in individuals with increased severity and frequency of COPD exacerbations, GOLD groups B and D, and those with lower FEV₁ (particularly GOLD 3 and 4). Demonstrating mortality benefits in randomized controlled trials has been difficult, requiring large populations and/or long follow-up duration and/or highly selected populations with a high but preventable risk of death during follow-up, and the low number of events makes the analysis of disease specific mortality in most trials difficult.

### Radiation therapy for gastric cancer: an ASTRO clinical practice guideline [^3a30b820]. Practical Radiation Oncology (2025). High credibility.

Radiation therapy (RT) for gastric cancer — RT is used in several clinical scenarios across the disease spectrum, and although phase 3 studies have not shown a benefit to preoperative or postoperative chemoradiation with perioperative chemotherapy and surgery, RT may be a therapeutic option depending on the stage, patient performance status, and adequacy and timing of surgery. For patients with locally unresectable and nonmetastatic gastric cancer, RT may have the potential to contribute to meaningful disease control, and RT has been long recognized as an effective tool in palliation of bleeding, pain and obstruction. Like surgery, RT may also play an important role in the treatment of oligometastases, and with innovations in RT (eg, stereotactic body RT, respiratory management, image guidance, adaptive planning, increases in safely deliverable dose) the indications for its use have extended, with robust study alongside novel systemic therapies, including immunotherapy, as well as surgery potentially identifying new therapeutic strategies. Related systemic therapy evidence includes that the MATTERHORN trial has shown that for patients with resectable disease, regardless of PD-L1 or microsatellite stability status, immunotherapy added to perioperative chemotherapy has improved pCR and event-free survival rates, and a trend towards improved OS in MATTERHORN suggests the possibility of statistical significance with longer follow-up.

### Socioeconomic value of treatments for chronic idiopathic constipation in Japan [^82aa5e3c]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

In Japanese clinical guidelines, all 3 study drugs are recommended equally, with no specific recommendations differentiating them. However, the drugs have slightly different unit prices (Table 1) and effectiveness, as reported in a previous study. Recently, there has been increasing focus on CIC-related symptoms, as CIC involves various symptoms that do not necessarily impose large medical costs but can significantly impact daily life and work productivity. Additionally, some symptoms that exacerbate CIC can be improved by new drugs. The latest Japanese guidelines recommend considering symptoms at diagnosis. Therefore, when selecting treatments for CIC, it is important to consider not only therapeutic effects, such as SBMs, but also other benefits, including improved QoL, reduced productivity loss, and reduced caregiver burden. In the present study, we considered an expanded socioeconomic burden beyond traditional value elements and found that elobixibat 10 mg was likely more cost-effective than the comparators. The cost-effectiveness of the subject drugs may change when considering their unique mechanisms of action (elobixibat: water secretion, promotion of colonic peristalsis, and restoration of the urge to defecate; linaclotide: activation of guanylate cyclase C, secretion of chloride ion and bicarbonate ion into the intestinal lumen, and concomitant fluid secretion; lubiprostone: activation of the type 2 chloride ion channel, promotion of the secretion of electrolytes and fluid into the intestinal tract), which are thought to influence CIC-related symptoms. Patients with CIC are often unaware of the broader socioeconomic burdens associated with their condition, but providing this information along with data on clinical efficacy may help guide treatment selection and encourage adherence through communication between patients and physicians. We focused on CIC-specific clinical values, which is narrow in terms of policy implications, but our results may have broader implications for therapeutic decision-making, similarly to other therapeutic areas where numerous treatment options exist for a given condition.

### Pouchitis unveiled: exploring clinical features, diagnosis, and cutting-edge treatments [^7aeb1a1a]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Advanced therapies

Current guidelines suggest, both for CARP and CADP, the use of advanced immunosuppressive therapies; in the case of CADP these therapies should be used in lieu of chronic, continuous antibiotic therapy, particularly in patients who are intolerant to antibiotics or when patients and/or providers are concerned about risks of long-term antibiotic therapy. While all therapies approved for UC may be used, including TNF-a antagonists (e.g. infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab pegol), vedolizumab, ustekinumab, mirikizumab, and small molecules (tofacitinib, upadacitinib, filgotinib, and ozanimod), vedolizumab is the only advanced therapy that received regulatory approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for CP itself.

It is worth noting that advanced therapies that patients have used before colectomy may be reconsidered, even if a retrospective study by Kayal et al.suggested that patients with anti-TNF exposure prior to colectomy were less likely to achieve clinical remission with a drug of the same class, compared to patients who were anti-TNF naïve preoperatively.

Treatment of Crohn's-like disease of the pouch

Even if there is a lack of evidence on the effectiveness of corticosteroids in patients with Crohn's-like disease of the pouch, given the experience and evidence on the efficacy in patients with luminal CD, these medications are likely to be effective in the management of Crohn's-like disease of the pouch. AGA therefore suggests the use of controlled ileal-release budesonide. Steroids should generally be used for a short duration (< 8 weeks) with consideration of steroid-sparing therapies for long-term use, such as advanced immunosuppressive therapies.

### Radiotherapy and surgery: can this combination be further optimized for patients with metastatic spine disease? [^3f5d4bf2]. The Oncologist (2025). Medium credibility.

Enhancing multidisciplinary collaboration

Recent advancements in the integrated use of radiotherapy and surgery for MSD have increased the need for collaborative treatment by spine surgeons and radiation oncologists. Furthermore, the expanded array of systemic oncologic therapies necessitates close collaboration with medical oncologists to further advance personalized care for patients with MSD. Multidisciplinary collaboration among radiation oncologists, spine surgeons, and medical oncologists plays a crucial role in timely referral, treatment decision-making, and managing patient expectations and satisfaction. A potentially crucial factor in improving multidisciplinary collaboration involves a better mutual understanding of ongoing technical advancements made within each other's respective domains. Having an idea of the advancements made in others' specialties might not only enhance clinical outcomes through more valuable multidisciplinary team meetings but also foster collaboration and further research on treatment integration. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of multidisciplinary collaboration and cross-domain awareness of technological advancements between radiation oncologists, spine surgeons and medical oncologists. This ensures prompt administration of optimal oncologic treatment, to allow for the best local control and quality of life for patients with spinal metastases.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^96616dbe]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Antiretroviral regimens for early HIV infection without prior CAB-LA PrEP — ART should be initiated with one of the combination regimens recommended for people with chronic HIV infection (AIII). For individuals who have not received CAB-LA as PrEP prior to diagnosis of acute HIV, one of the following INSTI-based regimens is recommended (AIII): BIC/TAF/FTC or DTG with (TDF or TAF) plus (3TC or FTC). Providers should inform individuals starting ART of the importance of adherence in achieving and maintaining viral suppression (AIII), and all women of childbearing potential should undergo a pregnancy test before initiating ART (AIII). DTG and BIC are good treatment options because transmitted resistance to second-generation INSTIs in the United States is rare at present and both have a high barrier to resistance.

### Increasing access to antiretroviral therapy for the prevention and treatment of HIV in infants, children, and youth in the United States: policy statement [^b01c9559]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

American Academy of Pediatrics policy statement on increasing access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in infants, children, and youth — background and disparities are summarized as follows: Without treatment, HIV infection is characterized by progressive immune suppression, leading to AIDS, with opportunistic infections (OIs) and other significant morbidities causing death. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has changed the prognosis and outcome in infants, children, and youth with HIV, and since the mid-1990s, when triple-drug ART became standard of care, children on ART have improved survival and are less likely to experience OIs, complications of HIV, or AIDS-related death. Although significant progress has been made, infants and children younger than 13 years have less access to optimal antiretroviral therapy compared with youth (13–24 years) and adults, which can negatively affect health outcomes for those with HIV; despite youth having nearly as many antiretroviral options for HIV management as adults, psychosocial and structural barriers result in poor access to HIV prevention and care, and significant barriers remain in providing equitable access to optimal HIV treatment and prevention services in the pediatric population.

### Guidelines for the use of antiretroviral agents in adults and adolescents with HIV [^9e1df72d]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) as a strategy to reduce inflammation — early HIV diagnosis combined with prompt ART initiation can effectively achieve a lower level of persistent immune activation, and most inflammatory markers decline during the first several months of ART and may achieve a stable "setpoint" within 1 to 2 years. In observational studies, people with HIV who initiated ART during acute HIV infection appeared to achieve a lower immune activation setpoint during ART-mediated viral suppression than those who started ART at later disease stages, and these data reinforce the recommendation to start ART as soon as possible after HIV diagnosis, regardless of CD4 count.

### Chronic hypoparathyroidism-current and emerging therapies [^945ffe01]. Endocrine Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Hypoparathyroidism (HypoPT) is a rare endocrine disorder characterized by low serum calcium due to insufficient parathyroid hormone (PTH) and results in significant complications. Conventional treatment for hypoparathyroidism with calcium salts and activated vitamin D has limitations such as inadequate control of symptomatic hypocalcemia and large pill burden. PTH replacement therapy offers a more physiologic alternative to conventional therapy. PTH (1–34) has a short half-life of 1 hour and is used off-label for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism. rhPTH (1–84) has a half life of 3 hours and improves symptom control but its production is being halted due to manufacturing issues. Palopegteriparatide has a 60-hour half life and results in an infusion like PTH release profile. This molecule is effective in lowering urinary calcium, maintaining serum eucalcemia, lowering serum phosphate and reducing pill burden and is now approved by the FDA and EMA. Emerging therapies include Eneboparatide which is currently being evaluated in phase 3 clinical trials. Encalaret is a calcilytic molecule which is in phase 3 clinical trials and is a promising molecule for autosomal dominant hypocalcemia type 1. New molecules include an oral PTH1receptor agonist which is in phase 1 clinical trials. A weekly PTH molecule is also being evaluated in phase 2 clinical trials.
