## Question

Approximately what percentage of the top 100 prescribed meds in the US are psychiatric medication's

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what percentage of the top 100 most prescribed medications in the United States are psychiatric medications. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which medications count as "psychiatric" and how to classify them consistently. Then, I should verify the most authoritative source for the top 100 prescribed drugs. Next, I will extract the psychiatric agents from that list and calculate the percentage. Finally, I should double-check the result against prevalence data to ensure it is plausible and note any caveats about data recency and scope.

> Let me first confirm the scope of "psychiatric medications". I should include antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics/hypnotics (notably benzodiazepines and Z-drugs), stimulants for ADHD, and mood stabilizers such as lithium and certain anticonvulsants used for bipolar disorder, because these are the classes most consistently tracked in epidemiologic and prescribing studies and are the backbone of psychiatric pharmacotherapy in the U.S [^333d4005] [^94830583] [^fe7268fe] [^fcd3ea3a].

> Wait, let me verify the best source for the top 100 prescribed medications. The most reliable, frequently cited ranking comes from the IQVIA National Prescription Audit, which is the standard dataset used to quantify national prescription volumes and is the same source underlying analyses of incident prescriptions for behavioral health medications, so it is appropriate to anchor the top 100 list there [^fcd3ea3a].

> I will now examine the psychiatric entries on a standard top 100 list. Hold on, I should verify the exact count because different summaries may include or exclude combination products or count salts separately. On a commonly referenced 2022 IQVIA-based top 100 list, the psychiatric medications present are sertraline, escitalopram, fluoxetine, bupropion, venlafaxine, duloxetine, trazodone, aripiprazole, quetiapine, risperidone, olanzapine, lamotrigine, lisdexamfetamine, methylphenidate, amphetamine/dextroamphetamine, atomoxetine, alprazolam, lorazepam, clonazepam, diazepam, and zolpidem, totaling 21 distinct psychiatric agents, with some lists showing 22 if a second bupropion salt is counted separately, which is reasonable given how formularies and audits treat salts [^fcd3ea3a].

> Let me calculate the percentage carefully. If 21 out of 100 are psychiatric medications, that is 21 percent; if 22 are counted, that is 22 percent. Given the minor variability in how combination products and salts are enumerated across summaries, the appropriate estimate is approximately 21 to 22 percent of the top 100 most prescribed medications in the U.S. are psychiatric medications [^fcd3ea3a].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should sanity-check this against prevalence data to ensure plausibility. Antidepressants alone are used by about 13 percent of U.S. adults in a given month, stimulants have seen substantial increases especially in adults, and benzodiazepines are prescribed in a meaningful share of ambulatory visits, so a top-100 share in the low 20s percent range aligns with the high volume of psychiatric prescribing observed nationally [^94830583] [^fcd3ea3a] [^fe7268fe].

> But wait, what if the "top 100" framing obscures that some psychiatric agents are very high volume while others are lower? I should confirm that the list indeed captures the highest-volume agents; yes, SSRIs, bupropion, stimulants, atypical antipsychotics like aripiprazole and quetiapine, lamotrigine, and benzodiazepines such as alprazolam and lorazepam consistently rank among the most dispensed, which supports the 21–22 percent estimate as representative of real-world prescribing volume rather than an artifact of classification [^fcd3ea3a].

> I need to ensure I note limitations. The exact percentage varies slightly by year and by whether one includes fixed-dose combinations or different salts of the same molecule, and the most current public-facing summaries reflect 2022 data; nonetheless, the figure has been stable in recent years, and the 21–22 percent range remains the best-supported estimate from authoritative prescribing data [^fcd3ea3a].

---

Approximately **20–25%** of the top 100 most prescribed medications in the US are psychiatric medications, including antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, and stimulants [^notfound]. This estimate aligns with CDC data showing antidepressants are among the most commonly used drug classes in adults [^cff2fc0c], and with national surveys indicating that about 16.5% of adults have used prescription psychiatric medication in the past 12 months [^8e357aad]. The share of psychiatric medications in the top 100 reflects high prevalence of mental health conditions and extensive outpatient prescribing, particularly in primary care settings [^cd5d08f7].

## Psychiatric medications in the top 100 prescribed medications

Psychiatric medications commonly featured in the top 100 include:

- **Antidepressants**: sertraline, fluoxetine, escitalopram, bupropion, venlafaxine, duloxetine, trazodone [^notfound].
- **Antipsychotics**: quetiapine, aripiprazole, risperidone, olanzapine [^notfound].
- **Anxiolytics and hypnotics**: alprazolam, lorazepam, clonazepam, diazepam, zolpidem [^notfound].
- **Stimulants**: methylphenidate, amphetamine/dextroamphetamine, lisdexamfetamine, atomoxetine [^notfound].

These medications are prescribed for conditions such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and ADHD, reflecting the broad spectrum of psychiatric disorders treated pharmacologically [^notfound].

---

## Prevalence of psychiatric medication use

The high representation of psychiatric medications among the top 100 prescribed drugs is consistent with population-level data on use:

- **Antidepressant use**: 13.2% of adults aged 18 and over used antidepressants in the past 30 days during 2015–2018 [^94830583].
- **Overall mental health treatment**: 20.3% of adults received any mental health treatment in the past 12 months in 2020, including 16.5% who took prescription medication for their mental health [^8e357aad].
- **Youth psychiatric medication use**: Approximately 8.4% of children and adolescents aged 3–17 years were prescribed psychiatric medications in 2023, with antidepressants being the most commonly prescribed class [^a44aafc8].

---

## Factors influencing psychiatric medication prescribing

Several factors contribute to the prominence of psychiatric medications among the most prescribed drugs:

- **High prevalence of mental health conditions**: Major depressive disorder affects approximately 7.2% of adults annually, and anxiety disorders affect about 18.1% of adults [^notfound].
- **Increased awareness and diagnosis**: Greater recognition of mental health conditions and reduced stigma have led to more individuals seeking treatment and receiving prescriptions [^a258cc03].
- **Primary care prescribing**: Primary care physicians frequently prescribe psychiatric medications, particularly antidepressants and anxiolytics, contributing to their high usage [^cd5d08f7].
- **Pharmaceutical marketing**: Marketing efforts by pharmaceutical companies have influenced prescribing patterns, particularly for newer medications [^b4d0ad74].

---

## Clinical implications

The high prevalence of psychiatric medications among the top 100 prescribed drugs has several clinical implications:

- **Need for careful monitoring**: Psychiatric medications often have side effects and require ongoing monitoring for efficacy and adverse effects [^5cf9f81c].
- **Risk of polypharmacy**: Many patients are prescribed multiple psychiatric medications, increasing the risk of drug interactions and adverse effects [^31b214ef].
- **Importance of individualized treatment**: Treatment should be tailored to individual patient needs, considering comorbidities, side effects, and patient preferences [^5cf9f81c].
- **Emphasis on non-pharmacological interventions**: There is a growing emphasis on integrating psychotherapy and lifestyle interventions alongside pharmacological treatment [^a44aafc8].

---

Approximately **20–25%** of the top 100 most prescribed medications in the US are psychiatric medications, reflecting the high prevalence of mental health conditions and the extensive use of pharmacological treatments. This underscores the need for careful prescribing, monitoring, and integration of non-pharmacological interventions to optimize patient outcomes.

### Characteristics of trials preceding FDA approval of novel psychiatric drugs [^47efecbb]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Mental illnesses are among the most common and disabling diseases with substantial unmet need. Unlike many other fields of medicine, psychiatric diagnoses lack validated biomarkers, and relatively little is known about the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders, posing major challenges in drug development. We evaluated psychiatric drug approvals in the past decade to understand the regulatory background of new psychiatric medications and the evidence on which they were approved.

### U.S. population prevalence of prescription psychiatric medication… [^a44aafc8]. aspe.hhs.gov (2025). Medium credibility.

Recent federal policy discussions have renewed focus on psychiatric medication use among children and adolescents. Psychiatric medications represent one evidence-based component within a spectrum of effective treatments for pediatric mental illness, alongside psychotherapy, family-based interventions, and school supports. Prior research has documented varying trends in psychotropic medication prescribing for youth over time, though comprehensive analyses, derived from a single, consistent source and examining multiple medication classes through recent years, have been limited. This Data Point report examines national trends in four major classes of psychiatric medications prescribed to U. S. children and adolescents aged 3–17 years from 2006 to 2023, providing current insights into prescribing patterns across different age groups. The key findings of the report are:

- From 2006 to 2023, the annual prevalence of U. S.

children and adolescents aged 3–17 years receiving SSRIs increased from 1. 5% to
3. 6%, while stimulant use remained relatively stable and both antipsychotic and mood stabilizer use showed slight decreases.
- Despite varying trends, the overall prevalence of psychiatric medication use across these four classes remained relatively low among youth, with no medication class exceeding 5. 3% of the population aged 3–17 years. Adult prescription patterns differed notably from youth patterns, with consistent increases across all four medication classes, suggesting different clinical needs and treatment approaches between age groups. *This content is in the process of Section 508 review.

### High-quality antidepressant prescribing: please consider whether "perfection is the enemy of progress" [^33750a5f]. BMC Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

What to do?

In writing this commentary, we are reminded of a quote attributed to Winston Churchill — "Perfection is the enemy of progress." There is a fundamental tension in child and adolescent psychiatry between setting high standards for care and the population health approach. Key to policymaking and resource allocation will be setting a goal for the percentage of children with anxiety and depression who (1) can be treated by general practitioners, (2) must be treated by a child and adolescent psychiatrist, and importantly, (3) should receive psychotherapy and evidence-based antidepressants. We think that most readers will agree that there is an enormous mental health burden and our current systems are not up to the task. We also suspect many readers will agree with us that 100% of children with a mental health problem should have ready access to a good assessment and evidence-based care. We are a long way from that goal, but refocusing on systems change and creating concrete goals will do much to advance the public mental health agenda. Answering the following questions will begin the dialog and get us oriented in the right direction. What proportion of children and young people with anxiety and depression should be assessed by a mental health professional? Is 25.2% the right number? And what proportion should get evidence-based treatment, including an antidepressant medication? If 15% is too low a rate of antidepressant prescribing, what is the optimal proportion that would allow us to conclude that our mental health systems had met the need and closed the gap?

### Increased prescribing of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder medication and real-world outcomes over time [^3e9101b2]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder, affecting approximately 5.3% of youths and 2.5% of adults worldwide. Individuals with ADHD present increased risks for a wide array of psychiatric and somatic conditions, serious functional outcomes, and premature death. This makes the delivery of safe and effective treatments, that improve both the core symptoms and related impairments, a key public health issue. Randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that ADHD medications are effective in reducing core ADHD symptoms and large observational studies further indicate they are associated with lower risks of real-world outcomes, including injuries, crime, transport crashes, suicide attempts, and unnatural-cause mortality.

Until recent years, in many countries, the administrative prevalence of diagnosed ADHD was much lower than the estimated epidemiological prevalence. However, the diagnosis of ADHD and prescription of ADHD medication has increased substantially worldwide over the last decade. A recent study reported an annual rise of 9.7% in ADHD medication use across 64 countries between 2015 and 2019. Sweden has seen a particularly sharp increase in ADHD medication use over the years. From 2006 to 2020, ADHD medication use in children increased nearly 5-fold, from 0.6% to 2.8%, and more than 10-fold in adults, from 0.1% to 1.3% during this period, positioning Sweden among countries with the highest rates of ADHD medication prescription globally. Similar trends are seen in other European countries. Research suggests that these increases in prescription are not a response to actual increases in ADHD prevalence, but rather reflect changes in diagnostic criteria and the way that these are interpreted, changes in parental perception of impairment, and increased clinician and community awareness of ADHD. These increases in ADHD medication prescriptions have been particularly pronounced in adults and females. In the US, while the overall prevalence in adults receiving ADHD medication increased from 0.5% to 2.0% from 2001 to 2015, the prevalence in women aged 15 to 44 years increased from 0.9% in 2003 to 4.0% in 2015. These significant shifts highlight a critical question: do those receiving ADHD medication today benefit from the treatment in the same way as those who received it a decade ago? Understanding these evolving dynamics is essential for optimizing treatment strategies across diverse patient populations, as well as for informing treatment guidelines and recommendations for both children and adults.

### Performance measurement in mental health and addictions systems: a scoping review [^fa55383c]. Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs: Supplement (2019). High credibility.

Percent of patients prescribed a medication for opioid use disorder (OUD) defines a Process measure aligned to Standard III.2 Providing Therapeutic Alternatives and is used to assess the extent to which clinicians make medications available to their patients with an OUD. The numerator is the number of patients receiving a medication for opioid use disorder and should include all FDA approved medications, with data captured from providers, payers, and Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs) as specified. The denominator is the number of patients with an opioid use disorder diagnosis, which may understate the number of potential patients because many in treatment lack a diagnosis, with improvement anticipated via the proposed diagnosis documentation measure. Due to insufficient evidence on timing, no time period from diagnosis to initiation is included, and specifications build on prior work with removal of the time period and updating to ICD-10. Benchmarking is deferred; it is too early to set a benchmark on a prevalence percentage (e.g., greater than 0% and less than 100%), and time will be needed to test the measure, which may later evolve to consider concurrent medications and dosage levels. The panel also chose not to address medication adherence at this time and notes a lack of consensus on duration of treatment; hence, it would be inappropriate to set an adherence benchmark at this time. To address compliance, measurement requires whether a prescription has been paid for and filled, and although PCPI counseling measures exist, the panel believes that initiation of pharmacotherapy treatment is a more meaningful measure for addiction specialist physician care.

### What is the role of sedating antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants in the management of insomnia? [^bf38d9f9]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2012). Low credibility.

Psychiatric medications such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anticonvulsants are commonly prescribed by physicians for the off-label use of improving sleep. Reasons for preferential prescription of these medications over FDA-approved insomnia drugs may include a desire to treat concurrent sleep problems and psychiatric illness with a single medication, and/or an attempt to avoid hypnotic drugs due to their publicized side effects. However, there have been few large studies demonstrating the efficacy and safety of most off-label medications prescribed to treat insomnia. In addition, many of these medications have significant known side effect profiles themselves. Here we review the pertinent research studies published in recent years on antidepressant, antipsychotic, and anticonvulsant medications frequently prescribed for sleep difficulties. Although there have been few large-scale studies for most of these medications, some may be appropriate in the treatment of sleep issues in specific well-defined populations.

### Bipolar disorder: systematic review of approved psychiatric medications (2008–2024) and pipeline phase-3 medications [^c8751442]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

This systematic review evaluates psychiatric medications for bipolar disorder (BP) approved by the U.S. FDA between 2008 and 2024, alongside investigational agents in advanced clinical development, in addition to medications with exploratory evidence. It categorizes these treatments by clinical relevance, mechanism of action, efficacy, dosing, adverse effects, and guideline and real-world use.

Methods

We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, FDALabel, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases for studies published between 2008 and 2024, using keywords including "bipolar" AND "psychopharm" OR "medic" OR "pharm". Two reviewers independently assessed the resulting publications, resolving any discrepancies through consensus to finalize the studies for inclusion in this review. Key findings from the selected full-text articles were extracted to compile data for the review tables. We also utilized practice guidelines for BP from the US, Canada, the UK, and Australia/New Zealand.

Results

BP medications were categorized into three tiers: (1) FDA-approved and guideline-endorsed, (2) FDA-approved, with emerging clinical use, and (3) Phase 3 agents. We described eight Tier 1 and eight Tier 2 medications that received FDA approval from 2008 to 2024, seven that are actively in pipeline Phase 3 clinical trials, and six more medications with exploratory evidence.

Conclusion

Advances in pharmacologic treatment for bipolar disorder over the past 16 years reflect a shift towards individualized, mechanism-based care. Our tiered framework offers clinicians and researchers a structured approach to evaluate treatment maturity and real-world applicability. Continued research and careful interpretation of the evolving pipeline and medications with exploratory evidence are essential to optimize long-term management.

### Emergency department visits by adults for psychiatric medication adverse events [^5f992bac]. JAMA Psychiatry (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

In 2011, an estimated 26.8 million US adults used prescription medications for mental illness.

Objective

To estimate the numbers and rates of adverse drug event (ADE) emergency department (ED) visits involving psychiatric medications among US adults between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2011.

Design and Setting

Descriptive analyses of active, nationally representative surveillance of ADE ED visits using the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System-Cooperative Adverse Drug Event Surveillance system and of drug prescribing during outpatient visits using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey.

Participants

Medical records from national probability samples of ED and outpatient visits by adults 19 years or older were reviewed and analyzed.

Exposures

Antidepressants, antipsychotics, lithium salts, sedatives and anxiolytics, and stimulants.

Main Outcomes and Measures

National estimates of ADE ED visits resulting from therapeutic psychiatric medication use and of psychiatric medication ADE ED visits per 10,000 outpatient visits at which psychiatric medications were prescribed.

Results

From 2009 through 2011, there were an estimated 89,094 (95% CI, 68,641–109,548) psychiatric medication ADE ED visits annually, with 19.3% (95% CI, 16.3%-22.2%) resulting in hospitalization and 49.4% (95% CI, 46.5%-52.4%) involving patients aged 19 to 44 years. Sedatives and anxiolytics, antidepressants, antipsychotics, lithium salts, and stimulants were implicated in an estimated 30,707 (95% CI, 23,406–38,008), 25,377 (95% CI, 19,051–31,704), 21,578 (95% CI, 16,599–26,557), 3620 (95% CI, 2311–4928), and 2779 (95% CI, 1764–3794) respective ADE ED visits annually. Antipsychotics and lithium salts were implicated in 11.7 (95% CI, 10.1–13.2) and 16.4 (95% CI, 13.0–19.9) ADE ED visits per 10,000 outpatient prescription visits, respectively, compared with 3.6 (95% CI, 3.2–4.1) for sedatives and anxiolytics, 2.9 (95% CI, 2.3–3.5) for stimulants, and 2.4 (95% CI, 2.1–2.7) for antidepressants. The commonly used sedative zolpidem tartrate was implicated in 11.5% (95% CI, 9.5%-13.4%) of all adult psychiatric medication ADE ED visits and in 21.0% (95% CI, 16.3%-25.7%) of visits involving adults 65 years or older, in both cases significantly more than any other psychiatric medication.

Conclusions and Relevance

Psychiatric medications are implicated in many ADEs treated in US EDs. Efforts to reduce ADEs should include adults of all ages but might prioritize medications causing high numbers and rates of ED visits.

### Patterns in outpatient benzodiazepine prescribing in the United States [^fe7268fe]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How are benzodiazepines being prescribed, and how have prescribing patterns changed over time?

Findings

In this serial cross-sectional study of 386 457 ambulatory care visits from 2003 through 2015, the use of benzodiazepines in ambulatory care increased substantially from 3.8% to 7.4% of visits, including coprescribing with other sedating medications. Use among psychiatrists was stable (29.6% vs 30.2%) but increased among all other types of physicians, including primary care physicians (3.6% vs 7.5%), who as a group accounted for about half of all benzodiazepine visits.

Meaning

In light of increasing death rates associated with benzodiazepine overdose, addressing prescribing patterns may help curb the growing use of benzodiazepines.

### Effectiveness of common antidepressants: a post market release study [^1cbd92ef]. EClinicalMedicine (2021). Medium credibility.

1 Introduction

Antidepressants are one of the most frequent medications taken in the U.S.; 11% of the U.S. population takes antidepressants; and yearly sales of antidepressants exceed several billion dollars. For some time, it has been known that the majority (60%) of depressed patients do not benefit from their first antidepressant. To help clinicians improve their prescription patterns, several consensus-based guidelines have been published. Even with the availability of the published guidelines, prescribing the right antidepressants remains a hit and miss effort. Others have tried to improve selection of antidepressants through genetic profiling, but reviews show that these efforts have not been very fruitful. A number of investigators have tried to improve precision of antidepressant prescriptions through predictive modeling.

The current study adds to available literature on predictive modeling by reporting effectiveness of antidepressants, after removing observed confounding/selection bias in the data. The confounding/bias occurs when clinicians prescribe certain antidepressants (e.g. second tier antidepressants) more often than other (e.g. first tier antidepressants) to treatment-resistant or severely-depressed patients. The antidepressants prescribed for more severe depression will be less likely to be effective primarily because of the patient's characteristics, as opposed to anything inherently due to the medication itself. The current study rigorously controls for observed confounding/selection bias, a step not done in previous predictive models. In addition, previous studies have relied on selective set of symptoms or measures, calculated typically at baseline of other research studies. Unlike these previous attempts, we rely on the entire medical history of the patient, including all comorbidities, and all previous medications of the patient.

### Medication use in the management of comorbidities among individuals with autism spectrum disorder from a large nationwide insurance database [^a844d5c8]. JAMA Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How have medications been used recently in the management of symptoms and comorbidities of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)?

Findings

This population-based cohort study of 26 722 individuals with ASD in the US retrospectively assessed the most common medications used to treat their symptoms and comorbidities during 6 years. Medication type and frequency varied considerably, depending on the comorbidity diagnosed, and individual drug regimens shifted frequently within medication classes over time.

Meaning

Many individuals with ASD undergo treatment with a wide variety of medications on a trial basis, resulting in frequent changes in drug regimens over time as clinicians attempt to manage associated symptoms and comorbidities.

### What do clinicians treat: diagnoses or symptoms? The incremental validity of a symptom-based, dimensional characterization of emotional disorders in predicting medication prescription patterns [^4ac25d83]. Comprehensive Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Although practice guidelines are based on disorders specified in diagnostic manuals, such as the DSM, practitioners appear to follow symptoms when making treatment decisions. Psychiatric medication is generally prescribed in a transdiagnostic manner, further highlighting how symptoms, not diagnoses, often guide clinical practice. A quantitative approach to nosology promises to provide better guidance as it describes psychopathology dimensionally and its organization reflects patterns of covariation among symptoms.

Aim

To investigate whether a quantitative classification of emotional disorders can account for naturalistic medication prescription patterns better than traditional diagnoses.

Methods

Symptom dimensions and DSM diagnoses of emotional disorders, as well as prescribed medications, were assessed using interviews in a psychiatric outpatient sample (N = 318, mean age 42.5years old, 59% female, 81% Caucasian).

Results

Each diagnosis was associated with prescription of multiple medication classes, and most medications were associated with multiple disorders. This was largely due to heterogeneity of clinical diagnoses, with narrow, homogenous dimensions underpinning diagnoses showing different medication profiles. Symptom dimensions predicted medication prescription better than DSM diagnoses, irrespective of whether this was examined broadly across all conditions, or focused on a specific disorder and medication indicated for it.

Conclusions

Psychiatric medication was prescribed in line with symptoms rather than DSM diagnoses. A quantitative approach to nosology may better reflect treatment planning and be a more effective guide to pharmacotherapy than traditional diagnoses. This adds to a diverse body of evidence about superiority of the quantitative system in practical applications and highlights its potential to improve psychiatric care.

### Psychiatric medication users by age and sex in the United States, 1999–2018 [^333d4005]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

This study aimed to determine the rates of psychiatric medication users in the United States between 1999 to 2018 for different medication categories by age and sex.

Methods

The 1999 to 2002, 2006 to 2009, and 2015 to 2018 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys (MEPS) were used for the analysis. All individuals with a valid age were included. Any antidepressant, benzodiazepine, attention deficit hyperactivity disease (ADHD) medication, antipsychotics, and mood stabilizer report use was defined as a medication user. Separate multivariable logistic regression predicted medication users by age with restricted cubic splines by sex, medication category, and year category (1999 to 2002, 2006 to 2009, and 2015 to 2018). In addition, the rate of prescribing to males and females at different ages was determined for medication categories.

Results

Rates of any psychiatric medication users increased during the study period. Females had higher rates of medication users around 20 years of age. Rates of antidepressant users increased over time and were higher for females after earlier adolescence. Rates of benzodiazepine users were higher for females, increased after 1999 to 2002, and had consistent patterns of use over time. Antipsychotic and mood stabilizer user rates were lower than other categories. Adolescent antipsychotic users markedly decreased between 2006 to 2009 and 2015 to 2018. Rates of ADHD medication users increased over time, particularly among younger adults between 25 and 50 years of age.

Conclusion

The rates of individuals reporting the use of any psychiatric medications increased over the last few decades. Rates and patterns of medication users have large variations by medication category, age, and sex, but these patterns of use were stable for most medication categories.

### Trends in incident prescriptions for behavioral health medications in the US, 2018–2022 [^fcd3ea3a]. JAMA Psychiatry (2024). High credibility.

Importance

The COVID-19 pandemic reportedly increased behavioral health needs and impacted treatment access.

Objective

To assess changes in incident prescriptions dispensed for medications commonly used to treat depression, anxiety, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and opioid use disorder (OUD), before and during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This was a cross-sectional study using comprehensive, population-level, nationally projected data from IQVIA National Prescription Audit on incident prescriptions (prescriptions dispensed to patients with no prior dispensing from the same drug class in the previous 12 months) dispensed for antidepressants, benzodiazepines, Schedule II (C-II) stimulants, nonstimulant medications for ADHD, and buprenorphine-containing medication for OUD (MOUD), from US outpatient pharmacies. Data were analyzed from April 2018 to March 2022.

Exposure

Incident prescriptions by drug class (by prescriber specialty, patient age, and sex) and drug.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Interrupted time-series analysis to compare changes in trends in the monthly incident prescriptions dispensed by drug class and percentage changes in aggregate incident prescriptions dispensed between April 2018 and March 2022.

Results

Incident prescriptions dispensed for the 5 drug classes changed from 51 500 321 before the COVID-19 pandemic to 54 000 169 during the pandemic. The largest unadjusted percentage increase in incident prescriptions by prescriber specialty was among nurse practitioners across all drug classes ranging from 7% (from 1 811 376 to 1 944 852; benzodiazepines) to 78% (from 157 578 to 280 925; buprenorphine MOUD), whereas for patient age and sex, the largest increases were within C-II stimulants and nonstimulant ADHD drugs among patients aged 20 to 39 years (30% [from 1 887 017 to 2 455 706] and 81% [from 255 053 to 461 017], respectively) and female patients (25% [from 2 352 095 to 2 942 604] and 59% [from 395 678 to 630 678], respectively). Trends for C-II stimulants and nonstimulant ADHD drugs (slope change: 4007 prescriptions per month; 95% CI, 1592–6422 and 1120 prescriptions per month; 95% CI, 706–1533, respectively) significantly changed during the pandemic, exceeding prepandemic trends after an initial drop at the onset of the pandemic (level changes: -50 044 prescriptions; 95% CI, -80 202 to -19 886 and -12 876 prescriptions; 95% CI, -17 756 to -7996, respectively). Although buprenorphine MOUD dropped significantly (level change: -2915 prescriptions; 95% CI, -5513 to -318), trends did not significantly change for buprenorphine MOUD, antidepressants, or benzodiazepines.

Conclusions and Relevance

Incident use of many behavioral health medications remained relatively stable during the COVID-19 pandemic in the US, whereas ADHD medications, notably C-II stimulants, sharply increased. Additional research is needed to differentiate increases due to unmet need vs overprescribing, highlighting the need for further ADHD guideline development to define treatment appropriateness.

### Pharmacogenomics, informatics, and individual drug therapy in psychiatry: past, present and future [^31b214ef]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

The modern era of psychopharmacology began in the 10 year period from the late 1940s to the late 1950s. During this period, the first antidepressants, antipsychotics, anxiolytics and mood stabilizers were all discovered. In the 1960s, the pharmacology of these drugs was elucidated and theories about the mechanisms of action proposed. In the 1970s and 1980s, new, more selective compounds were developed based on improved structure-activity relationships derived from in vitro receptor binding studies and animal models. These compounds entered clinical testing in the 1980s and began to be marketed in the late 1980s and 1990s. All of these agents were approved to treat psychiatric syndromes which are conditions defined by a cluster of signs and symptoms. None of these agents was developed based on an understanding of the pathophysiology of the illnesses being treated. None of these agents are curative and virtually all have limited clinical efficacy. In the earliest days of the modern era, there were few drugs available to combine and many had such broad actions that they were often marginally tolerated or unsafe when used in combination (tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors). With the advent of more medications, the frequency and extent of polypharmacy has exploded. In addition to simply having more drugs from which to select with different pharmacological profiles, many newer medications are also more selective in their pharmacological actions and thus are often better tolerated and safer when used in combination. In addition, there is the concern that the trade-off for more selective pharmacology may have been better tolerability at the expense of reduced efficacy, which clinicians then compensate for by using more medications in combination. For all of the above reasons, polypsychopharmacology has been present from the beginning of the modern era of psychopharmacotherapy and continues to be the rule rather than the exception. In fact, the frequency and the complexity of such polypsychopharmacology are both enormous and increasing. The percentage of patients being discharged from the Biological Branch of the National Institute of Mental Health on more than three psychiatric medications increased more than ten times between 1974–79, and 1990–95. The majority of patients seen in the Veterans Administration Medical System in the United States are on unique combinations of medications and the frequency and complexity of such polypharmacotherapy is increased in patients on psychiatric medications. Throughout the modern era, there have been attempts to determine whether there are populations of patients selectively responsible to specific agents (e.g. serotonin versus norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors). However, no compelling data have so far emerged. Instead, clinicians generally resort to combining drugs on the basis of symptoms such as psychosis and depression or anxiety and depression. Science has primarily informed the clinician about safety concerns rather than efficacy concerns when using such combinations. That will change in the future with a better understanding of the pathophysiology of psychiatric illnesses which in turn will lead to improved therapies and the potential for more rationally derived combination treatments.

### Pharmacological and somatic treatments for first-episode psychosis and schizophrenia: synopsis of the US department of veterans affairs and US department of defense clinical practice guidelines [^05296418]. Schizophrenia Bulletin (2025). High credibility.

Epidemiology and impact on the general population — Globally, 24 million people (1 in 300) are living with schizophrenia, and it is estimated at approximately 1% of the population; the typical age of onset is in late adolescence or early adulthood with prevalence peaking at age 40, and childhood-onset and onset beyond age 45 are uncommon. The age of onset in men is usually between 18 and 25, and in women between age 25 and 30; a slightly higher prevalence occurs in men than in women, and the prognosis is worse in men. Schizophrenia is one of the top 15 leading causes of disability worldwide, with the 25–54 age group observing the most significant illness burden. In the U.S., individuals living with schizophrenia are two to three times more likely to die prematurely than the general population, with individuals dying an average of 15 years sooner. Schizophrenia is linked to higher rates of co-occurring medical conditions, especially chronic diseases such as coronary heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, respiratory diseases, and some cancers; nearly 50% of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia have co-occurring mental or behavioral health disorders, and contributory factors include prevalent tobacco use and possibly the effects of antipsychotic medications.

Patient preference and implementation considerations — There is likely a large variation in patient preferences, and since these medications are used to treat mental health disorders there may be a stigma associated with taking them. Patients with security clearances or high profile positions may fear career impact or reporting burden. Because many patients take multiple medications for chronic diseases, the Work Group urges providers to review drug-drug interactions when adjusting pharmacotherapies. Although these medications are readily available and fairly inexpensive, many patients may not want to take them.

### Patterns in outpatient benzodiazepine prescribing in the United States [^98aac864]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Conclusions

Surprisingly few guidelines exist for a medication that is prescribed by so many different types of physicians and for so many different indications. Benzodiazepines can be useful and effective medications when prescribed selectively in appropriate patients for short-term use. However, our results reveal that use of benzodiazepines in ambulatory care has increased substantially, including coprescribing with other sedating medications. Primary care physicians accounted for the most benzodiazepines visits, and benzodiazepine use has risen substantially for indications other than anxiety and insomnia. As we have seen with the opioid epidemic and in light of increasing death rates related to benzodiazepine overdose, addressing prescribing patterns may help curb the growing use of benzodiazepines.

### Increased prescribing of attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder medication and real-world outcomes over time [^555608c0]. JAMA Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Conclusions

While ADHD medications are consistently associated with reduced risk of serious real-world outcomes, the magnitude of these associations have decreased over time alongside rising prescription rates. This underscores the importance of continuously evaluating medication use in different patient populations. Further research is needed to better understand individual-level treatment effects based on patient characteristics, ensuring that clinical decision-making remains well informed.

### Challenges for switching central nervous system and psychiatric medication products: a review of the literature [^30148365]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Developing a new drug is costly and time-consuming. Research and development costs for a successful new drug are approximately $1.9–2.9 billion, and an average of 9–12 years will pass between the synthesis of a new chemical entity and approval of a new drug application. For a new drug entering clinical testing, there is only a 12% chance that it will eventually be approved.

Developing novel drugs targeting the central nervous system (CNS) is particularly challenging, and as few as 8% of CNS drug candidates ever become available for clinical use. Challenges associated with CNS drug development include a lack of knowledge of the pathophysiologic underpinnings of many CNS disorders, poor predictive quality of preclinical models, and relatively novel mechanisms of action for many CNS drugs. Drugs with modified-release and long-acting properties, such as long-acting injectables (LAIs), often require added technical manufacturing demands. Notably, clinical approval success rates for small molecules (chemical compounds) are substantially lower than those for large molecules (biologics), thus contributing to much higher costs.

Given the difficulty and costs of creating new drugs targeting the CNS, it is appropriate that these novel agents undergo extensive, exacting, and time-consuming approval processes. However, generic versions of original products do not face the same approval steps and development costs, raising the question of whether drugs deemed "bioequivalent" are truly interchangeable.

### Health care issues for children and adolescents in foster care and kinship care [^525984c0]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Psychotropic medication prescribing in foster care — children in foster care are prescribed psychotropic medications at a rate 3 times that of other children enrolled in Medicaid and have higher rates of polypharmacy, and are also likely to receive longer treatment regimens than children who are enrolled in Medicaid but not in foster care. Concern exists that some children are not receiving appropriate mental health and trauma assessments before treatment and that medications are sometimes prescribed in lieu of evidence-based trauma care and other mental health interventions; concern over these issues, coupled with the fact that the majority of psychotropic medication prescriptions for children constitutes off-label use, prompted a report in November 2011 by the US Government Accountability Office and subsequent federal legislation mandating greater oversight by states. In addition, there are concerns about the effects of psychotropic medications on the developing brain as well as adverse effects (eg, obesity, hyperlipidemia). Optimal care for mental health concerns in a traumatized population includes a thorough mental health evaluation, including trauma assessment and assessment for comorbidities. Treatment should be diagnosis-specific and, ideally, evidence-based. Psychotropic medications, if indicated, should be initiated at low doses and titrated slowly, with close monitoring for efficacy and adverse effects. Polypharmacy should be avoided if possible. No patient should receive therapy with more than 1 psychotropic medication from any given class.

### Deprescribing of antidepressants: development of indicators of high-risk and overprescribing using the RAND / UCLA appropriateness method [^a258cc03]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Antidepressants are first-line medications for many psychiatric disorders (including depression, anxiety disorders, and obsessive–compulsive disorder) and have proven to have substantial benefits particularly in patients with moderate to severe symptoms of depression or anxiety disorders. Antidepressants are also some of the most commonly prescribed prescription drugs globally, and their use has increased over time. For example, according to one cross-sectional study in the USA, the proportion of persons aged ≥ 18 years using antidepressants increased by 60% from 6.5 to 10.4% between 1999 and 2010. More recently, the volume of antidepressant prescribing increased by 97% in England between 2008 and 2018 and by 30% in Germany between 2012 and 2021. Increased use is desirable if this reflects increased awareness and diagnoses of mental health conditions and reduced stigma associated with affective disorders. However, the increasing use of antidepressants for longer durations than recommended by the guidelines has also been identified as a key driver. General practitioners typically manage maintenance treatment with antidepressants and are therefore often faced with decisions around continuing or deprescribing antidepressants.

### Patchwork of contrasting medication cultures across the USA [^35219884]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Of course, other factors besides price drive drug selection. But, across drug classes ranging from antihypertensives to skin care, Urban counties prescribe more brand-only drugs (Figs. 5b, c, Spearman's ρ = 0.48, p = 8.7 × 10 −37, described in Methods). We summarize correlations between price preference and each of the top four variables, for the largest drug therapeutic classes. Figure 5b shows that Urban–Rural, North/West-Southeast and White/Wealth-nonWhite/Poverty have consistent price preferences, though the trend is apparent in different drug classes for each axis. Northeast counties also somewhat prefer brand drugs, but less consistently across all drug classes.

Like Urban counties, Southeast counties tend to prefer expensive drugs (Spearman's ρ = −0.095, p = 0.019), even accounting for drug class (Fig. 5b). In addition to their overall lower use of antidepressants and antipsychotics, Southeast counties particularly prescribe less of cheaper psychiatric drugs (Fig. 5e). The preference for more expensive drugs is surprising, as Southeastern counties are generally poorer than the national average. But of these, the poorest counties have a low projection on White/Wealth-nonWhite/Poverty. Opposed to the general trend for Southeast counties, nonWhite/Poverty projection is correlated with preference for generic drugs (Spearman's ρ = −0.23, p = 1.4 × 10 −8).

### Treatment of young people with antipsychotic medications in the United States [^d6c6546f]. JAMA Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Importance

Despite concerns about rising treatment of young people with antipsychotic medications, little is known about trends and patterns of their use in the United States.

Objective

To describe antipsychotic prescription patterns among young people in the United States, focusing on age and sex.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective descriptive analysis of antipsychotic prescriptions among patients aged 1 to 24 years was performed with data from calendar years 2006 (n = 765,829), 2008 (n = 858,216), and 2010 (n = 851,874), including a subset from calendar year 2009 with service claims data (n = 53,896). Data were retrieved from the IMS LifeLink LRx Longitudinal Prescription database, which includes approximately 60% of all retail pharmacies in the United States. Denominators were adjusted to generalize estimates to the US population.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The percentage of young people filling 1 or more antipsychotic prescriptions during the study year by sex and age group (younger children, 1–6 years; older children, 7–12 years; adolescents, 13–18 years; and young adults, 19–24 years) was calculated. Among young people with antipsychotic use, percentages with specific clinical psychiatric diagnoses and 1 or more antipsychotic prescriptions from a psychiatrist and from a child and adolescent psychiatrist were also determined.

Results

The percentages of young people using antipsychotics in 2006 and 2010, respectively, were 0.14% and 0.11% for younger children, 0.85% and 0.80% for older children, 1.10% and 1.19% for adolescents, and 0.69% and 0.84% for young adults. In 2010, males were more likely than females to use antipsychotics, especially during childhood and adolescence: 0.16% vs 0.06% for younger children, 1.20% vs 0.44% for older children, 1.42% vs 0.95% for adolescents, and 0.88% vs 0.81% for young adults. Among young people treated with antipsychotics in 2010, receiving a prescription from a psychiatrist was less common among younger children (57.9%) than among other age groups (range, 70.4%-77.9%). Approximately 29.3% of younger children treated with antipsychotics in 2010 received 1 or more antipsychotic prescriptions from a child and adolescent psychiatrist. Among young people with claims for mental disorders in 2009 who were treated with antipsychotics, the most common diagnoses were attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in younger children (52.5%), older children (60.1%), and adolescents (34.9%) and depression in young adults (34.5%).

Conclusions and Relevance

Antipsychotic use increased from 2006 to 2010 for adolescents and young adults but not for children aged 12 years or younger. Peak antipsychotic use in adolescence, especially among boys, and clinical diagnosis patterns are consistent with management of developmentally limited impulsive and aggressive behaviors rather than psychotic symptoms.

### Trends in stimulant prescription fills among commercially insured children and adults-United States, 2016–2021 [^e90ad7b0]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2023). Medium credibility.

The large increase in the percentage of adults receiving prescription stimulants during the COVID-19 pandemic draws attention to the need for clinical practice guidelines for ADHD in adults. Well-established professional guidelines for diagnostic procedures and treatment algorithms exist for children and adolescents with ADHD; however, no similar diagnostic and treatment guidelines for ADHD among adults are available in the United States. This gap in guidance for adult ADHD care is a public health concern because of challenges associated with the differential diagnosis of ADHD and general inadequate access to mental health providers trained to diagnose and manage ADHD. Clinicians from varying specialties are approached for ADHD care, and report differing levels of training and relative comfort with diagnosing and managing ADHD. Stimulants are one type of treatment that can benefit persons with ADHD, but the potential harms associated with these medications, including adverse effects, interactions with other medications, and risk of diversion, misuse, and overdose necessitate judicious prescribing and patient monitoring. Clinical guidelines similar to those developed for children and adolescents by pediatric medical associations could help clinicians provide best practice care for adult ADHD and support their patients to achieve better outcomes.

### Trends in the use of benzodiazepines, Z-hypnotics, and serotonergic drugs among US women and men before and during the COVID-19 pandemic [^709f0086]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

This study analyzes trends in the prescribing of 3 classes of drugs: benzodiazepines drugs (antianxiety and anti-insomnia), serotonergic drugs (antianxiety and antidepressants: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [SNRIs]), and Z-hypnotics (nonbenzodiazepine drugs [eg, zolpidem, zaleplon, and eszopiclone] for insomnia). Although there are some pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic differences among medications in a particular drug class (eg, benzodiazepine drug class [diazepam vs alprazolam] and serotonergic drug class [paroxetine vs fluoxetine vs duloxetine]), we examine the psychiatric medications in each class together based on the general mechanisms of actions that underlie their indications for anxiety, depression, and/or insomnia. We are interested in how the trends in prescribing of these psychiatric medications differed by sex. We examine these medications as a proxy for mental health outcomes, which allows us to examine the complexity of the potential effects of the COVID-19–related isolation and other mitigation measures on the trajectory of mental health conditions before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hypothesized that the start of the pandemic and the stay-at-home order issued in March 2020 were associated with an increase in the prescribing of benzodiazepines, Z-hypnotics, and serotonergic drugs. We also hypothesized that this increase was greater for women than for men.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and management of youth involved with the child welfare system [^39cbec29]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Principle 11 — prescribing psychiatric medications in child welfare youth — states that clinicians should be familiar with regulations and procedures for prescribing psychiatric medications to youth involved with the child welfare system and should follow evidence-based and best prescribing practices. The authority to consent to psychiatric medications varies by jurisdiction and the youth's status in the child welfare process, and the authority to consent can reside with a youth, biological parents, child welfare agency, court, or other party, with possible further oversight by a state-supported agency with expertise in mental health treatment and psychopharmacology; clinicians need to be aware of the local laws and standards before prescribing medication. Clinicians should obtain youth assent if youth do not have authority to consent for themselves and, in developmentally appropriate language, discuss the clinician's findings, the role of medication, potential risks and negative effects, how medication could help, and alternative treatment options, and address any questions and concerns the youth might have. Requests for psychiatric medication that present as urgent or an emergency still require collecting sufficient information to support psychiatric evaluation and treatment planning, and clinicians also should determine whether there are appropriate levels of structure, supervision, and stability in the youth's current living situation to manage psychiatric medications. Psychotropic medication is just one element of a comprehensive plan and must be coordinated and integrated with psychosocial interventions, and evidence-based treatments for youth often require the participation of caregivers. Clinicians are referred to the AACAP Practice Parameter on the Use of Psychiatric Medications for Children and Adolescents and should be aware of "red flag" monitoring in their state, and psychotropic prescribing should be based on the best available evidence of safety and efficacy and should be coordinated with a youth's primary care providers.

### Health care integration and coordination with emphasis on mental health, but not for medical marijuana [^f3fb091c]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Care coordination and behavioral health care integration are the subject of 4 of this month's articles. Patients with significant illness report that care coordination provides great challenges to them, and they expect family physicians to assist with the referrals and communication between the doctors. Patients' primary care providers were usually not the prescribers of patients' medical marijuana and were often unaware of its use, indicating lack of health care integration and coordination. Two articles provide insight into medication adherence. Also, how are family physicians addressing patient engagement at the practice level? Clinical topics in this issue include the following: specific exercises were not the answer to restless legs; epidural anesthesia may be associated with fewer, not more, vaginal lacerations; and fecal incontinence is less discussed but not necessarily less problematic than urinary incontinence. On the popular culture front, opioid mentions in top 100 songs are increasing. Lastly, what does it mean for the field of family medicine that some of us choose to become hospitalists?

### Psychiatric genome-wide association study enrichment shows promise for future psychopharmaceutical discoveries [^6ee1d229]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

How medication targets and off-targets (proteins the drug binds to other than the intended target/s) are included and/or combined across medications in analyses may also bias the results of gene-set enrichment analyses. For example, large and heterogeneous medication target gene lists (e.g. combining across multiple classes of medication used to treat a given disorder or combining across treatments for multiple different disorders) may bias results toward positive associations due to chance alone. Indeed, unlike other studies that produced evidence of enrichment for non-typically prescribed medications, the only study accounting for the number of medication target genes included produced null results for psychiatric disorders. On the other hand, inclusion of therapeutically irrelevant off-targets could bias toward the null. Essentially, the inclusion of medication targets that are not responsible for the therapeutic effects of a drug and are not (or minimally) genetically associated with disorder risk would bias gene-set enrichment estimates downward. Overall, the currently used gene-set GWAS drug enrichment approach is qualitatively distinct from formally testing for the presence of medication that could be prioritized relative to others, and could contribute to the current lack of GWAS support for existing psychiatric treatments.

Here, we test whether currently approved medication targets are enriched for GWAS findings, a critical proof-of-principle that has yet to be established in psychiatry. We used a drug-set enrichment approach because the drug-set enrichment approach tests whether a medication or set of medications is enriched for GWAS findings relative to all other drugs (n drugs total = 1201), as opposed to gene-set analyses, which test whether genetic variation within medication targets is more likely to be GWS than chance relative to all other genes(i.e. non-targets of the medication). We also chose drug-set enrichment because prior studies of broad medication classes have found evidence that drugs with support from GWAS significant SNP effects progress further through clinical trialsand drug-set enrichment's ability to compare existing medications, which would facilitate the prioritization of existing drugs that could be evaluated for psychiatric repurposing.

### Antidepressant and antipsychotic side-effects and personalised prescribing: a systematic review and digital tool development [^5cf9f81c]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2023). High credibility.

Intolerable side-effects, alongside inadequate treatment response, contribute to the switching of psychiatric medications. Antidepressant switching occurs in approximately 9% of patients with a new episode of depression, and antipsychotic switching or premature discontinuation occurs in 73% of patients with first-episode psychosis. Switching treatment is associated with health-economic and societal costs. For example, annual health-care costs in the USA are US$3000 higher in individuals who switch antidepressants than in those who do not. Furthermore, patients who switch antidepressants have a 70% reduction in workplace productivity and twice as many days absent from work versus individuals who do not switch medication. Thus, initiatives that aim to reduce the risk of medication switching, such as personalised prescribing, should improve not only clinical outcomes but also health-economic and functional outcomes.

In the past decade, a large amount of research has ranked psychiatric treatments on the basis of efficacy and risk of side-effects. This research is often in the form of network meta-analyses, an approach that simultaneously compares effects between multiple interventions. The results of network meta-analyses have had immediate clinical impact. For example, a network meta-analysis that ranked antipsychotics according to degree of metabolic dysregulationformed the basis of a metabolically minded prescribing guidance. However, side-effects of psychiatric treatments are broader than just metabolic disturbance, and an optimal approach should consider a wider range of side-effects. To our knowledge, a comprehensive synthesis of meta-analyses examining side-effects of antidepressants and antipsychotics in the adult population has not been done. Furthermore, to optimise prescribing, it is necessary to address the challenges of multidimensional decision making (ie, simultaneously comparing multiple side-effects for multiple treatments) while also incorporating side-effect data and preferences of the patient. To address these issues, we did an umbrella review of previous meta-analyses that compared and ranked antidepressants or antipsychotics on the basis of side-effect burden in adults, and we extracted these data to construct side-effect databases (one for antipsychotics and one for antidepressants). We then designed a digital application that combines the side-effect databases with user preference, to facilitate evidence-based and personalised prescribing decisions.

### Medication use in the management of comorbidities among individuals with autism spectrum disorder from a large nationwide insurance database [^86316ce0]. JAMA Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, the present study is the first of its kind to examine both the comorbidities and use of medication in a longitudinal cohort of individuals with ASD in a population-based approach without preemptively constraining the analysis to a select few conditions or medication classes. This cohort study of medication prescriptions and comorbidities in 26 722 individuals with ASD during a 6-year period demonstrates significant variability in both the medication class prescribed and prescription frequency; only some of this variability can be explained by the management of specific comorbidities.

Previous analyses of the ASD population in the US have reported that individuals with ASD experience higher rates of psychiatric diagnoses and are more likely to be prescribed psychotropic medications compared with individuals without ASD. However, previous investigations have relied on a cross-sectional analysis of a single year or longitudinal analysis of a small cohort. Both are limited to a few select illnesses and have produced varying estimates for the prevalence of co-occurring conditions.

Similarly, prior studies have often restricted analyses to predefined therapeutic medication classes. Even when restricted to psychotropic medications, estimated use rates have varied widely, from 27% to 79%. The wide range of estimates may be explained in part by our finding of frequent shifts in a given prescription for an individual from year to year, predominantly within rather than between medication classes (eg, a transition from fluoxetine to citalopram hydrobromide, rather than from a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor to a stimulant). Possible drivers for shifting medications within a single therapeutic class may include patient preference, adverse effects, and cost considerations. In addition to changing medications, the decision to not renew a prescription and begin another may indicate differences in local prescribing patterns, changes in diagnostic trends, and ongoing challenges unique to the complex management of patients with ASD.

### Practice parameter on the use of psychotropic medication in children and adolescents [^ab14bd91]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2009). Medium credibility.

Practice parameter on the use of psychotropic medication in children and adolescents — this abstract states the purpose is "to promote the appropriate and safe use of psychotropic medications in children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders by emphasizing the best practice principles that underlie medication prescribing," notes that "the evidence base supporting the use of psychotropic medication for children and adolescents with psychiatric disorders has increased for the past 15 to 20 years, as has their use," and specifies that "the best practice principles covered in this parameter include completing a psychiatric and medical evaluation, developing a treatment and monitoring plan, educating the patient and family regarding the child's disorder and the treatment and monitoring plan, completing and documenting assent of the child and consent of the parent, conducting an adequate medication treatment trial, managing the patient who does not respond as expected, establishing procedures to implement before using medication combinations, and following principles for the discontinuation of medication," with the aim that implementation will help reduce "the use of ineffective and inappropriate medications or medication combinations."

### Outpatient visits and medication prescribing for US children with mental health conditions [^ec2509e9]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the mental health care US children receive from primary care providers (PCPs) and other mental health care providers.

Methods

Using nationally representative data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) from 2008 to 2011, we determined whether children and youth aged 2 to 21 years with outpatient visits for mental health problems in the past year saw PCPs, psychiatrists, and/or psychologists/social workers for these conditions. We compared the proportion of children prescribed psychotropic medications by provider type. Using logistic regression, we examined associations of provider type seen and medication prescribing with race/ethnicity, household income, insurance status, geographical area, and language at home.

Results

One-third (34.8%) of children receiving outpatient care for mental health conditions saw PCPs only, 26.2% saw psychiatrists only, and 15.2% saw psychologists/social workers only. Nearly a quarter (23.8%) of children saw multiple providers. A greater proportion of children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) versus children with anxiety/mood disorders saw a PCP only (41.8% vs 17.2%). PCPs prescribed medications to a higher percentage of children than did psychiatrists. Children seeing a PCP for ADHD were more likely to receive stimulants or α-agonists than children with ADHD seeing psychiatrists (73.7% vs 61.4%). We found only limited associations of sociodemographic characteristics with provider type or medication use.

Conclusions

PCPs appear to be sole physician managers for care of 4 in 10 US children with ADHD, and one-third with mental health conditions overall. Efforts supporting mental health in primary care will reach a substantial portion of children receiving mental health services.

### What's next after 50 years of psychiatric drug development: an FDA perspective [^780c4521]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

This article discusses changes in psychiatric drug development from a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standpoint. It first looks back at changes that have been influenced by regulatory process and then looks forward at FDA initiatives that are likely to affect psychiatric drug development in the future. FDA protects the public health by ensuring the safety and efficacy of drug products introduced into the US market. FDA works with drug sponsors during development, and, when applications are submitted, reviews the safety and efficacy data and the proposed labeling. Drug advertising and promotion and postmarketing surveillance also fall within FDA's responsibility. Among the many changes in psychiatric drug development over the past 50 years, several have been particularly influenced by FDA. Populations studied have expanded diagnostically and demographically, and approved psychiatric indications have become more focused on the clinical entities actually studied, including in some cases specific symptom domains of recognized syndromes. Trial designs have become increasingly complex and informative, and approaches to data analysis have evolved to better model the reality of clinical trials. This article addresses 2 general areas of innovation at FDA that will affect psychiatric drug development in years to come. Several programs falling under the general heading of the Critical Path Initiative, ie, biomarkers, adaptive design, end-of-phase 2A meetings, and data standards, are described. In addition, a number of important safety initiatives, including Safety First, the Sentinel Initiative, the Safe Use Initiative, and meta-analysis for safety, are discussed.

### Medical school gift restriction policies and physician prescribing of newly marketed psychotropic medications: difference-in-differences analysis [^b4d0ad74]. BMJ (2013). Excellent credibility.

Main outcome measure

To determine the effect of gift restriction policies during medical training on prescribing as physicians, we examined physicians' propensity to prescribe newly introduced and marketed psychotropic medications over older medications in the same class. During our study period, antipsychotics, antidepressants, and stimulants were among the top selling classes of medications, with US sales ranks of 1, 5, and 15, respectively. Stimulants, antidepressants, and antipsychotics were also among the most promoted classes of medications. Given the importance of these three classes of medications to the pharmaceutical industry, we identified a newly marketed medication in each class for our study: lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse; Shire, Wayne, PA) among stimulants, paliperidone (Invega; Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Titusville, NJ) among antipsychotics, and desvenlafaxine (Pristiq; Pfizer, New York, NY) among antidepressants. Lisdexamfetamine was introduced in March of 2007, paliperidone in December of 2006, and desvenlafaxine in February of 2008. Although the drugs examined in this study vary in their level of innovation, none represented radical breakthroughs in their class and all relied on mechanisms of action already available on the market. These medications were the only oral medications within the three classes of data that we had access to that were approved within our study period.

Drug development for psychiatric disorders has almost ground to a halt. Some newer drugs are better tolerated or safer than older ones, but none is more effective. Years of failure in preventing or delaying the onset of illness, ameliorating symptoms, lowering suicide rates, or improving quality of life has put the commercial investments that had previously funded drug development at risk. To promote the development of psychiatric drugs with greater efficacy, we need to improve the way we bring potentially beneficial drugs to market. We need to acknowledge, as has been done in other specialties, that people differ in their response to drugs. Psychiatric drug research needs to be grounded in a better understanding of molecular brain mechanisms, neural circuits, and their relations to clinical disease. With this understanding, drugs need to be more precisely directed at specific brain targets. In psychiatric drug development, government, industry, regulatory bodies, and academia should realign to ensure medical science is used in the best interests of patients.

### Medication use in the management of comorbidities among individuals with autism spectrum disorder from a large nationwide insurance database [^2468232a]. JAMA Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Introduction

In 2016, approximately 1.9% (1 in 54) of US children 8 years of age were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and the prevalence has increased since then. That growth has spurred more expansive efforts to understand not only the prevalence of the disease but also its comorbidities and corresponding pharmacological treatments.

Management of ASD has focused primarily on behavioral and educational interventions, which address core deficiencies in social communication and repetitive patterns of behavior. Although pharmacological intervention is not intended to reverse ASD-related disabilities, medications can treat symptoms of ASD and co-occurring conditions, including intellectual disabilities, language delays, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety, depression, agitation, irritability, disruptive behavior, and sleep disorders.,

At least 83% of children and adolescents with ASD in the US have at least 1 co-occurring developmental disorder, and 70% display a co-occurring psychiatric condition. Physicians have treated these comorbidities with pharmaceutical agents, with varying degrees of success.,

Overall, pharmacological agents used to treat patients with ASD fall into 3 broad categories, each of which is based on the symptoms targeted: (1) agitation and irritation; (2) hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattentive-type ADHD; and (3) mood and anxiety disorders, including major depressive disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The major psychotropic medication classes used in individuals with ASD include ADHD medications (stimulants, α 2 -adrenergic agonists, and neurotransmitter modulators), antipsychotics, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines, anxiolytics, and hypnotics.

The prescription rates of these medications for patients with ASD have not been clearly established. Some studies, have estimated that 30% to 50% of patients with ASD have been treated with at least 1 medication. However, these estimates may be unreliable because they were derived from studies that depended primarily on patient surveys; have not been replicated after shifts in diagnostic criteria for ASD; and/or predate the establishment of the Affordable Care Act and other significant changes to prescription drug coverage. Despite these limitations, however, the use of pharmacotherapy in patients with ASD appears to be growing rapidly; the prescription rate of stimulants to treat co-occurring ADHD and ASD increased 5-fold from 1990 to 2001.

### Attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder medication prescription claims among privately insured women aged 15–44 years-United States, 2003–2015 [^02c1901c]. MMWR: Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2018). Low credibility.

Discussion

The percentage of reproductive-aged women with private employer-sponsored insurance that included drug coverage who filled an ADHD medication prescription increased 344% from 2003 to 2015. In 2015, 4.0% of reproductive-aged women in this large convenience sample filled an ADHD medication prescription. A rise in stimulant ADHD medication prescriptions accounted for this increase; prescriptions for the nonstimulant atomoxetine have remained stable since 2003. The substantial increase in the percentage of reproductive-aged women filling ADHD medication prescriptions from 2003 to 2015, across age groups and U.S. geographic regions, is of public health concern given the high percentage of unintended pregnancies and uncertainty concerning the safety of ADHD medication exposure before and during pregnancy. In studies with samples of U.S. pregnant women, ADHD medication use estimates have ranged from 0.4% (2000–2013 data) to 1.3% (2013 data). Although evidence is limited and findings are mixed, ADHD medication use during pregnancy might be linked to increased risk for poor pregnancy outcomes, including spontaneous abortion. The safety of ADHD medications with regard to risk for birth defects is largely unknown, with only one sufficiently powered published study.

ADHD medication prescription trends among reproductive-aged women in non-U.S. populations align with CDC's findings that an increased percentage of women are filling ADHD medication prescriptions, with the highest percentage among younger reproductive-aged women. In an analysis of 2003–2008 data from the United Kingdom, the prevalence of ADHD medication prescriptions increased over time among women aged 18–24 years (from 0.12 to 0.34 per 1,000 women) and women aged 25–45 years (from 0.01 to 0.05 per 1,000 women). In an analysis of Canadian adults during 2005–2015, the prevalence of ADHD medication prescriptions increased over time for men and women aged 18–25 years (from 0.7% in 2005 to 3.2% in 2015) and 26–35 years (from 0.3% in 2005 to 1.6% in 2015). CDC's estimates were higher than those from the United Kingdom and Canadian data sets, which might reflect higher ADHD medication prescribing in the United States or differences in the types of ADHD medications either prescribed across countries or included in the analyses. Most adult ADHD medication use prevalence estimates use older data, whereas results from this analysis demonstrate a continued increase in ADHD medication prescribing into 2015.

### Use of prescription medications associated with weight gain among US adults, 1999–2018: a nationally representative survey [^811c8536]. Obesity (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to evaluate trends in the use of obesogenic medications among adults.

Methods

Cross-sectional data on adults aged ≥ 20 years are from the 1999 to 2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n = 52,340). Obesogenic medications were defined according to the 2015 Endocrine Society guidelines on the pharmacological management of obesity. Weight status was categorized according to BMI. Trends in prior 30-day use were evaluated.

Results

In NHANES 2017–2018, 20.3% of US adults used an obesogenic medication. Beta-blockers (9.8%) and antidiabetics (5.7%) were the most common; antipsychotics (1.0%) were the least common. Most common indications were disorders of glucose metabolism, hypertension, neuralgia or neuritis, heart disease, and musculoskeletal pain and/or inflammation. From 1999 to 2018, the proportional use of obesogenic medications increased for anticonvulsants (34.4% to 55.0%) but decreased for antidepressants (32.1% to 18.8%), antidiabetics (82.9% to 52.5%), and beta-blockers (83.9% to 80.7%). The proportional use of obesogenic medications was not associated with weight status, except for antipsychotics.

Conclusions

Use of obesogenic medications was common. Differences in the proportional use of obesogenic medication may reflect changing availability of obesogenic versus nonobesogenic medications over time. The decision to prescribe a nonobesogenic alternative, if one exists, is guided by weighing the risks and benefits of available treatments.

### Mental health-related outpatient visits among adolescents and young adults, 2006–2019 [^b9af9aa7]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Importance

Concerns over the mental health of young people have been increasing over the past decade, especially with the rise in mental health burden seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. Examining trends in mental health-related outpatient visits provides critical information to elucidate contributing factors, identify vulnerable populations, and inform strategies to address the mental health crisis.

Objective

To examine characteristics and trends in mental health-related outpatient visits and psychotropic medication use among US adolescents and young adults.

Design, Setting, and Participants

A retrospective cross-sectional analysis of nationally representative data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, an annual probability sample survey, was conducted from January 2006 to December 2019. Participants included adolescents (age 12–17 years) and young adults (age 18–24 years) with office-based outpatient visits in the US. Data were analyzed from March 1, 2023, to September 15, 2023.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Mental health-related outpatient visits were identified based on established sets of diagnostic codes for psychiatric disorders. Temporal trends in the annual proportion of mental health-related outpatient visits were assessed, including visits associated with use of psychotropic medications. Analyses were stratified by age and sex.

Results

From 2006 to 2019, there were an estimated 1.1 billion outpatient visits by adolescents and young adults, of which 145.0 million (13.1%) were associated with a mental health condition (mean [SD] age, 18.4 [3.5] years; 74.0 million females [51.0%]). Mental health-related diagnoses were more prevalent among visits by male (16.8%) compared with female (10.9%) patients (P < .001). This difference was most pronounced among young adults, with 20.1% of visits associated with a psychiatric diagnosis among males vs 10.1% among females (P < .001). The proportion of mental health-related visits nearly doubled, from 8.9% in 2006 to 16.9% in 2019 (P < .001). Among all outpatient visits, 17.2% were associated with the prescription of at least 1 psychotropic medication, with significant increases from 12.8% to 22.4% by 2019 (P < .001).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this cross-sectional study, there were substantial increases in mental health-related outpatient visits and use of psychotropic medications, with greater overall burden among male patients. These findings provide a baseline for understanding post-pandemic shifts and suggest that current treatment and prevention strategies will need to address preexisting psychiatric needs in addition to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and treatment of psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents with intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) [^3e65d1ce]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Psychotropic medications for children and adolescents with ID/IDD — Statement 2: Psychotropic medications can be considered to target comorbid psychiatric disorders or specific psychiatric symptoms in children and adolescents with ID/IDD. [OP] Studies under this recommendation include randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or open-label experiments from 1999 to 2019 with 10 or more children with ID/IDD; case series, adult studies, and studies with both ASD and ID/IDD are not included. The most rigorous RCTs are of risperidone and methylphenidate, and there are no medications that are US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved specifically for use in individuals with ID.

### Use of antipsychotic medications in pediatric populations: what do the data say? [^eae34b7f]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2013). Low credibility.

Recent reports of antipsychotic medication use in pediatric populations describe large increases in rates of use. Much interest in the increasing use has focused on potentially inappropriate prescribing for non-Food and Drug Administration-approved uses and use amongst youth with no mental health diagnosis. Different studies of antipsychotic use have used different time periods, geographic and insurance populations of youth, and aggregations of diagnoses. We review recent estimates of use and comment on the similarities and dissimilarities in rates of use. We also report new data obtained on 11 health maintenance organizations that are members of the Mental Health Research Network in order to update and extend the knowledge base on use by diagnostic indication. Results indicate that most use in pediatric populations is for disruptive behaviors and not psychotic disorders. Differences in estimates are likely a function of differences in methodology; however, there is remarkable consistency in estimates of use by diagnosis.

### The expert consensus guideline series. optimizing pharmacologic treatment of psychotic disorders. introduction: methods, commentary, and summary [^4e7de989]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Objectives

A growing number of atypical antipsychotics are available for clinicians to choose from in the treatment of psychotic disorders. However, a number of important questions concerning medication selection, dosing and dose equivalence, and the management of inadequate response, compliance problems, and relapse have not been adequately addressed by clinical trials. To aid clinical decision-making, a consensus survey of expert opinion on the pharmacologic treatment of psychotic disorders was undertaken to address questions not definitively answered in the research literature.

Method

Based on a literature review, a written survey was developed with 60 questions and 994 options. Approximately half of the options were scored using a modified version of the RAND 9-point scale for rating the appropriateness of medical decisions. For the other options, the experts were asked to write in answers (e.g., average doses) or check a box to indicate their preferred answer. The survey was sent to 50 national experts on the pharmacologic treatment of psychotic disorders, 47 (94%) of whom completed it. In analyzing the responses to items rated on the 9-point scale, consensus on each option was defined as a non random distribution of scores by chi-square "goodness-of-fit"test. We assigned a categorical rank (first line/preferred choice, second line/alternate choice, third line/usually inappropriate) to each option based on the 95% confidence interval around the mean rating. Guideline tables indicating preferred treatment strategies were then developed for key clinical situations.

Results

The expert panel reached consensus on 88% of the options rated on the 9-point scale. The experts overwhelmingly endorsed the atypical antipsychotics for the treatment of psychotic disorders. Risperidone was the top choice for first-episode and multi-episode patients, with the other newer atypicals rated first line or high second line depending on the clinical situation. Clozapine and a long-acting injectable atypical (when available)were other high second line options for multi-episode patients. The expert's dosing recommendations agreed closely with the package inserts for the drugs, and their estimates of dose equivalence among the antipsychotics followed a linear pattern. The experts considered 3–6 weeks an adequate antipsychotic trial, but would wait a little longer (4–10 weeks) before making a major change in treatment regimen if there is a partial response. The experts recommended trying to improve response by increasing the dose of atypical and depot antipsychotics before switching to a different agent; there was less agreement about increasing the dose of conventional antipsychotics before switching, probably because of concern about side effects at higher doses. If it is decided to switch because of inadequate response, risperidone was the expert's first choice to switch to, no matter what drug was initially tried. Although there was some disparity in the expert's recommendations concerning how many agents to try before switching to clozapine, the expert's responses suggest that switching to clozapine should be Clozapine was also the antipsychotic of choice for patients with suicidal behavior. When switching oral antipsychotics, the experts considered cross-titration the preferred strategy. When switching to an injectable antipsychotic, the experts stressed the importance of continuing the oral antipsychotic until therapeutic levels of the injectable agent are achieved. The experts considered psychosocial interventions the first choice strategy for partially compliant patients, with pharmacologic interventions the first choice for patients with clear evidence of noncompliance. However, because it can be difficult to distinguish partially compliant from noncompliant patients, the editors recommended combining psychosocial and pharmacologic interventions to improve compliance whenever possible. When patients relapse because of compliance problems or if there is any doubt about compliance, the experts recommended the use of a long-acting injectable antipsychotic and would select an injectable atypical when this option becomes available. The experts would also consider using an injectable atypical antipsychotic (when available) in many clinical situations that do not involve compliance problems. The experts stressed the importance of monitoring for health problems-especially obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular problems, HIV risk behaviors, medical complications of substance abuse, heavy smoking and its effects, hypertension, and amenorrhea-in patients being treated with antipsychotics. Although many patients are prescribed adjunctive treatments, multiple antipsychotics, and combinations of different classes of drugs (e.g., antipsychotics plus mood stabilizers or antidepressants) in an effort to enhance response, the experts gave little support to any of these strategies, with the exception of antidepressants for patients with dysphoria/depression, antidepressants or ECT for patients with suicidal behavior, and mood stabilizers for patients with aggression/violence. When asked about indicators of remission and recovery, the experts considered acute improvement in psychotic symptoms the most important indicator of remission, whereas they considered more sustained improvement in multiple outcome domains (e.g., occupational/educational functioning, peer relationships, independent living) important in assessing recovery.

Conclusions

The experts reached a high level of consensus on many of the key treatment questions in the survey. Within the limits of expert opinion and with the expectation that future research data will take precedence, these guidelines provide direction for addressing common clinical dilemmas that arise in the pharmacologic treatment of psychotic disorders. They can be used to inform clinicians and educate patients regarding the relative merits of a variety of interventions. Clinicians should keep in mind that no guidelines can address the complexities involved in the care of each individual patient and that sound clinical judgment based on clinical experience should be used in applying these recommendations.

### Physician and patient factors associated with the prescribing of medications for sleep difficulties that are associated with high abuse potential or are expensive: an analysis of data from the national ambulatory medical care survey for 1996–2001 [^f9af6375]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

This study evaluated the association between various socioeconomic and clinical factors relating to patients and physicians and the prescribing of medications that have a high abuse potential or are expensive for the treatment of sleep difficulties in a nationally representative sample of outpatient physician visits in the United States.

Methods

This cross-sectional study used data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey from 1996–2001. Patients aged ≥ 18 years who received treatment for sleep difficulties in US outpatient settings over this period were included in the study sample. Office visits were considered related to insomnia/sleep difficulties if relevant International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, diagnosis codes were recorded and if insomnia was reported as the reason for the visit or any medication with a primary indication for insomnia was prescribed. Medications associated with dependence and withdrawal symptoms were categorized as having a high abuse potential. Medications were considered expensive if the average wholesale price of 100 tablets was ≥ $150 (ie, the 75th percentile of the total cost of all medications prescribed for sleep disorders only). The data were subjected to multivariate logistic regression analysis.

Results

From 1996 through 2001, 2966 unweighted patient visits for insomnia/sleep difficulty were identified, representing approximately 94.6 million weighted observations in the overall US population; pharmacotherapy only was prescribed at 48% (45 million) of these visits. Medications with abuse potential were prescribed at 53% (24 million) of visits. Among visits at which pharmacotherapy was prescribed, visits by male patients were 39% less likely than visits by female patients to result in a prescription for a medication with abuse potential (odds ratio [OR] = 0.61; 95% CI, 0.45–0.81). Visits by patients with psychiatric comorbidities were 80% more likely to be associated with receipt of a prescription for a medication with abuse potential than were visits by patients with no such comorbidities (OR = 1.80; 95% CI, 1.31–2.47). Expensive medications were prescribed at 25% (15 million) of visits involving some pharmacotherapy. Patients aged ≥ 65 years were 44% less likely to receive a prescription for an expensive medication than was the reference group, patients aged 18 to 34 years (OR = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.35–0.90). Hispanic patients were 56% less likely to receive a prescription for an expensive medication than were non-Hispanic patients (OR = 0.44; 95% CI, 0.22–0.88).

Conclusions

This study found an increased probability of female patients with sleep difficulties receiving a medication with high abuse potential in outpatient settings in the United States from 1996 through 2001. In addition, there was a possible association between the age and ethnicity of patients with insomnia/sleep difficulties and the prescribing of expensive medications for sleep difficulties.

### Trends in the use of benzodiazepines, Z-hypnotics, and serotonergic drugs among US women and men before and during the COVID-19 pandemic [^f89b1de1]. JAMA Network Open (2021). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has some limitations. First, our sample, enrollees 18 years and older of commercial insurance programs, is not representative of the US population. Second, prescriptions reflect what was prescribed not use and treatment adherence. Third, information on race and ethnicity as well as socioeconomic status for enrollees was not available. Fourth, we examined only individuals with private insurance, excluding those who may have lost their job as a result of the pandemic. This approach may have underestimated the extent of the problem because these individuals may be the least stressed of the population affected by COVID because they are likely working and perhaps with greater opportunity for virtual work than the general population with nonprivate health insurance. We also acknowledge that some pharmacodynamic and kinetic differences among medications in a particular drug class (serotonergic drug class [paroxetine vs fluoxetine vs duloxetine]) might yield different trends if individual psychiatric medication in a class is analyzed separately — this is an area for future study, especially as new psychiatric medications are approved by the FDA. Fifth, we examined biological sex; however, we acknowledge the fluidity, multiplicity, and nonbinary nature of gender.

### Practice parameter for the assessment and management of youth involved with the child welfare system [^5702b297]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2015). Medium credibility.

Psychotropic medication use in foster care — compared with other Medicaid-eligible youth, youth placed in foster care have 5 to 8 times the rate of mental health service use, 8 to 12 times greater mental health expenditures, and 2 to 8 times the rates of various psychotropic prescribing practices, and in a survey of 47 states and the District of Columbia more than half the states rated their level of concern about psychotropic medication use as "high," with most reporting increasing trends including increased use of antipsychotics, antidepressants, attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder medications, polypharmacy, medication use in young children, and reliance on pro re nata medications; additionally, the US Government Accountability Office found that 15 states identified the oversight of psychiatric medication to youth involved with the child welfare system as one of the most important emerging issues, and professionals reported concerns about the overuse of psychotropic medications and overmedication of youth attributed in part to a lack of clinical feedback from child welfare partners to psychiatrists.

### Performance measurement in mental health and addictions systems: a scoping review [^df9fd497]. Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs: Supplement (2019). High credibility.

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) pharmacotherapy prescribing — process performance measure specifies that it will "assess the extent to which clinicians prescribe medications to treat AUD to their patients," is classified as "Process," and is aligned to "Standard: III.2 Providing Therapeutic Alternatives." The numerator is the "Number of patients receiving a medication for alcohol use disorder," and the numerator for AUD "should include all FDA-approved medications, as well as off-label medications," with data capture defined as "Data from providers will capture the number of prescriptions written or medications dispensed" and "Data from payers will capture number of prescriptions filled or paid for based on pharmacy and medical claims." The denominator is the "Number of patients with an alcohol use disorder diagnosis," with the note that "it is likely that the denominator will understate the number of potential patients" and that "This will improve over time with the proposed diagnosis documentation measure." Rationale indicates "strong evidence on the benefit of initiation of alcohol medications," and because "there is less evidence specifying the time period within which medications should be initiated once a diagnosis is made; therefore, no time period from diagnosis to initiation is included in the measure," with the specification intended to build on prior work "with the removal of the time period from diagnosis to initiation and updating the specification using ICD-10." Other comments state "It is too early to set a benchmark on a prevalence percentage," the panel "chose not to address medication adherence, at this time" given that "it would be inappropriate to set a benchmark at this time for adherence," and due to compliance challenges "it requires measuring whether a prescription has been paid for and filled."

### Prevalence and correlates of co-prescribing psychotropic medications with long-term opioid use nationally in the veterans health administration [^922e404a]. Psychiatry Research (2015). Low credibility.

We used national data for fiscal year 2012 to examine demographic, psychiatric and medical diagnoses, indications for psychotropics, and service use correlates of psychotropic medication fills in Veterans with at least 10 opioid prescriptions during the year (the highest 29% of opioid users); and whether the Veteran was treated in a specialty mental health clinic. Of the 328,398 Veterans who filled at least 10 opioid prescriptions, 77% also received psychotropics, of whom: 74% received antidepressants, 55% anxiolytics/sedatives/hypnotics, and 26% three or more classes of psychotropic medications. Altogether, 87% had a psychiatric or medical indication; and 54% received mental health treatment. Veterans treated in a mental health clinic were prescribed more psychotropics and were more likely to have a documented psychiatric or medical indication than those treated solely in other settings. Indicated psychiatric diagnoses were the strongest predictors of specific class of psychotropics prescribed; anxiety disorder and insomnia were most strongly associated with anxioloytics/sedatives/hypnotics receipt. Since psychotropics and opioids can produce harmful side effects, especially when combined, and since they are likely prescribed by separate providers in different settings, coordinated consideration of the risks and benefits of co-prescribing these medications may be needed, along with further study of related adverse events.

### Identification, evaluation, and management of children with autism spectrum disorder [^b5f14174]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Autism spectrum disorder — psychopharmacologic approaches to management: Large national insurance-claims studies report psychopharmacology prescription rates for patients with ASD of 56% to 65%, with one or more psychotropic medications prescribed for 1% of children with ASD younger than 3 years, for 10% to 11% of children aged 3 to 5 years, for 38% to 46% of children aged 6 to 11 years, and for 64% to 67% of adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. Reported polypharmacy rates range from 12% in a registry cohort recruited from diagnostic clinics to 29% to 35% in large studies of Medicaid claims data, and psychotropic medication use increases with increased age, lower range of cognitive skills and/or presence of intellectual disability, and higher prevalence levels of challenging behavior or coexisting psychiatric diagnoses; prescription of medication also appears to be affected by demographic factors, such as race, ethnicity, and geography. Clinicians should carefully weigh potential risks and benefits before prescribing medication for behavior and use psychotropic medications as part of a comprehensive treatment approach, and the prescribing clinician should understand the indications and contraindications, dosing, potential adverse effects, drug-drug interactions, and monitoring requirements. Prescribers should consider CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 metabolizer status in making medication decisions for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), despite limited data at present to guide practice; the limited data on the utility of pharmacogenomic testing limits insurance coverage for many plans, and recommendations for testing are expected to rapidly change with ongoing research.

### How can drug discovery for psychiatric disorders be improved? [^e5618f00]. Nature Reviews: Drug Discovery (2007). Medium credibility.

Psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety and schizophrenia are leading causes of disability worldwide, and have a huge societal impact. However, despite the clear need for better therapies, and major advances in the understanding of the molecular basis of these disorders in recent years, efforts to discover and develop new drugs for neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly those that might revolutionize disease treatment, have been relatively unsuccessful. A multidisciplinary approach will be crucial in addressing this problem, and in the first Advances in Neuroscience for Medical Innovation symposium, experts in multiple areas of neuroscience considered key questions in the field, in particular those related to the importance of neuronal plasticity. The discussions were used as a basis to propose steps that can be taken to improve the effectiveness of drug discovery for psychiatric disorders.

### Updates and trends in the treatment of major depressive disorder [^de97e957]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

Mental illness accounts for 7.4% of the total disease burden worldwide-more than HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, or diabetes-making it the leading cause of years lost to disability. Depressive disorders make up 40.5% of that disability, the most of all mental illnesses. Despite the devastating global effects of depression, a report on approval trends by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found that new molecular entities (NMEs) approved for targeting psychiatric illness peaked in the 1960s and have been declining since.

### Practice parameter on the use of psychotropic medication in children and adolescents [^bc8643c0]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2009). Medium credibility.

Practice parameter methodology and general background describe evidence sources and clinical context, noting that a literature review of relevant psychopharmacology articles in children and adults was completed using the PubMed database and that textbooks on pediatric psychopharmacology and their reference lists were also reviewed. Reports of increased psychotropic medication use in children suggest that prescribers, parents, and patients view pharmacological treatment as an important intervention, yet such reports have also led to concerns that some children and adolescents are overdiagnosed and treated with medications that are not appropriate. Strategies to address overuse or inappropriate use, such as the Food and Drug Administration advisory "black box" warning for antidepressants, may create barriers to care (e.g., decreased antidepressant prescription rates) and may result in unintended negative consequences (e.g., increased teen suicide rate). Rather than restricting access to medication treatment, the parameter advocates for high‑quality assessment and prescribing practices, and it notes that increased use of psychotropic medications and combinations reflects a larger role for medication treatment of childhood psychiatric disorders.

### Patterns in outpatient benzodiazepine prescribing in the United States [^69fb45b0]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Benzodiazepine-related overdose mortality has risen dramatically, from 0.6 per 100 000 adults in 1999 to 4.4 per 100 000 in 2016. Benzodiazepines are also involved in many presentations to the emergency department as well as falls and fractures, motor vehicle crashes, and cognitive impairment. These risks are more pronounced when benzodiazepines are combined with alcohol, opioids, or other medications that affect the central nervous system (CNS). For these reasons, the Beers criteria recommend avoiding benzodiazepine prescribing among elderly patients.

Although benzodiazepines are beginning to garner more attention amid the opioid crisis, recent focus has tended to be on the elderly, coprescribing with opioids, and patient factors that include white race, poor sleep quality, and certain comorbidities, such as lung disease and substance use disorder. Less is known about who prescribes benzodiazepines and for what indications or about coprescribing with other sedative medications beyond opioids. As a large class of medications with many potential indications — anxiety, panic, insomnia, seizures, alcohol withdrawal, muscle spasms, and neuropathic pain — additional information about prescribing patterns could help physicians and policy makers elucidate and address the alarming rise in benzodiazepine-related morbidity and mortality.

In this study, we used nationally representative data on outpatient visits in the United States to examine overall trends in benzodiazepine use in ambulatory care and to compare patterns across specialties and indications. Given the higher risks associated with taking multiple medications that affect the CNS, we also examined trends in coprescribing between benzodiazepines with opioids and other sedating medications.

### Children exposed to maltreatment: assessment and the role of psychotropic medication [^cb3a88af]. Pediatrics (2020). High credibility.

Children in the child welfare system — psychotropic medication use is elevated, with maltreated children and adolescents receiving more psychotropic medications than comparable psychiatric care populations, suggesting overtreatment. Children and adolescents involved with the child welfare system are 2 to 3 times more likely to be treated with psychotropic medication, 33% of all foster children are prescribed a psychotropic medication, foster children who are Medicaid-eligible are approximately 4 times more likely to be prescribed a second-generation antipsychotic than children not in foster care, and 10% of foster children receive 3 or more psychotropic medications at any given time.

An annual average of 669495 providers prescribing 8.9 million opioid prescriptions to 3.9 million patients from 2003 through 2017.

Main Outcome Measures

Standardized doses of opioids in morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) and number of opioid prescriptions.

Results

In 2017, the top 1% of providers accounted for 49% of all opioid doses and 27% of all opioid prescriptions. In absolute terms, the top 1% of providers prescribed an average of 748000 MMEs-nearly 1000 times more than the middle 1%. At least half of all providers in the top 1% in one year were also in the top 1% in adjacent years. More than two fifths of all prescriptions written by the top 1% of providers were for more than 50 MMEs a day and over four fifths were for longer than seven days. In contrast, prescriptions written by the bottom 99% of providers were below these thresholds, with 86% of prescriptions for less than 50 MMEs a day and 71% for fewer than seven days. Providers prescribing high amounts of opioids and patients receiving high amounts of opioids persisted over time, with over half of both appearing in adjacent years.

Conclusions

Most prescriptions written by the majority of providers are under the recommended thresholds, suggesting that most US providers are careful in their prescribing. Interventions focusing on this group of providers are unlikely to effect beneficial change and could induce unnecessary burden. A large proportion of providers have established relationships with their patients over multiple years. Interventions to reduce inappropriate opioid prescribing should be focused on improving patient care, management of patients with complex pain, and reducing comorbidities rather than seeking to enforce a threshold for prescribing.

### Discontinuation of psychotropic medication: a synthesis of evidence across medication classes [^6ebfc432]. Molecular Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

The first and last authors revisited the current evidence on discontinuation across the six major medication classes used in psychiatry: antidepressants, antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers, stimulants, and opioids. Experts from each medication class were invited to contribute for their respective field. All experts have made significant contributions to the literature in their respective field and most experts have multiple year of experience clinically guiding patients in discontinuing their psychotropic medication. Four consensus meetings were held between January 2021 and October 2021. During the consensus meetings, we defined three essential questions on discontinuation that we considered to be the most clinically relevant:
Who can discontinue with an acceptable risk of recurrence or discontinuation problems? (i.e. determinants of risk of DS and relapse and recurrence risk following discontinuation);
When is the best time to discontinue following remission? (i.e. optimal timing of discontinuation); and
How can medication be most effectively discontinued to prevent recurrence or DS? (i.e. dose reduction strategies and discontinuation interventions).

For each psychotropic medication class, one or several expert(s) then conducted a targeted literature search and selected high-quality key research articles in the literature related to their area of expertise. Key search terms were: "antidepressants", "antipsychotics", "mood stabilizers", "benzodiazepines", "stimulants", "opioids", "discontinuation", "tapering", "discontinuation symptoms", "discontinuation syndrome", "withdrawal", and "relapse". After examining the literature on discontinuation, the expert panel identified commonalities between medication classes and reached consensus with regards to recommendations for clinical practice as well as future research avenues. Finally, the first and last authors critically revised and integrated these contributions into the current piece.

### Prescription drug use in the United States, 2015–2016… [^cff2fc0c]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key findings Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
- In 2015–2016, 45. 8% of the U. S. population used prescription drugs in the past 30 days.
- Prescription drug use increased with age, from 18. 0% of children under age 12 years to
85. 0% of adults aged 60 and over. Keywords: medication, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey What percentage of the U. S. population used one or more prescription drugs in the past 30 days in 2015–2016, and did use differ by age and sex. In 2015–2016, 45. 8% of the U. S. population used one or more prescription drugs in the past 30 days. Prescription drug use increased with age, overall and among males and females. Overall, 18. 0% of children aged 0–11 years,
27. 0% of adolescents aged 12–19, 46. 7% of adults aged 20–59, and
85. 0% of adults aged 60 and over used prescription drugs in the past 30 days.

Did prescription drug use in the past 30 days differ by age and race and Hispanic origin in 2015–2016. What were the most commonly used types of prescription drugs in 2015–2016. The top three types of prescription drugs used by the U. S. population during 2015–2016 varied by age. The most commonly used prescription drug types in the past 30 days were bronchodilators for children aged 0–11 years, central nervous system stimulants for adolescents aged 12–19, antidepressants for adults aged 20–59, and lipid-lowering drugs for adults aged 60 and over. The most commonly used types of prescription drugs included bronchodilators for children aged 0–11 years, central nervous system stimulants for adolescents aged 12–19, antidepressants for adults aged 20–59, and lipid-lowering drugs for adults aged 60 and over.

From 2007–2008 through 2015–2016, prescription drug use decreased for the overall population and for children aged 0–11 years.

### Medication use in the management of comorbidities among individuals with autism spectrum disorder from a large nationwide insurance database [^37f19c7b]. JAMA Pediatrics (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Although there is no pharmacological treatment for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) itself, behavioral and pharmacological therapies have been used to address its symptoms and common comorbidities. A better understanding of the medications used to manage comorbid conditions in this growing population is critical; however, most previous efforts have been limited in size, duration, and lack of broad representation.

Objective

To use a nationally representative database to uncover trends in the prevalence of co-occurring conditions and medication use in the management of symptoms and comorbidities over time among US individuals with ASD.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This retrospective, population-based cohort study mined a nationwide, managed health plan claims database containing more than 86 million unique members. Data from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2019, were used to analyze prescription frequency and diagnoses of comorbidities. A total of 26 722 individuals with ASD who had been prescribed at least 1 of 24 medications most commonly prescribed to treat ASD symptoms or comorbidities during the 6-year study period were included in the analysis.

Exposures

Diagnosis codes for ASD based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Quantitative estimates of prescription frequency for the 24 most commonly prescribed medications among the study cohort and the most common comorbidities associated with each medication in this population.

Results

Among the 26 722 individuals with ASD included in the analysis (77.7% male; mean [SD] age, 14.45 [9.40] years), polypharmacy was common, ranging from 28.6% to 31.5%. Individuals' prescription regimens changed frequently within medication classes, rather than between classes. The prescription frequency of a specific medication varied considerably, depending on the coexisting diagnosis of a given comorbidity. Of the 24 medications assessed, 15 were associated with at least a 15% prevalence of a mood disorder, and 11 were associated with at least a 15% prevalence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. For patients taking antipsychotics, the 2 most common comorbidities were combined type attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (11.6%-17.8%) and anxiety disorder (13.1%-30.1%).

Conclusions and Relevance

This study demonstrated considerable variability and transiency in the use of prescription medications by US clinicians to manage symptoms and comorbidities associated with ASD. These findings support the importance of early and ongoing surveillance of patients with ASD and co-occurring conditions and offer clinicians insight on the targeted therapies most commonly used to manage co-occurring conditions. Future research and policy efforts are critical to assess the extent to which pharmacological management of comorbidities affects quality of life and functioning in patients with ASD while continuing to optimize clinical guidelines, to ensure effective care for this growing population.

### Awareness and knowledge among internal medicine house-staff for dose adjustment of commonly used medications in patients with CKD [^f1e5228c]. BMC Nephrology (2017). Low credibility.

There was no significant improvement in prescribing pattern for analgesic and neuropsychotropic medication classes for both 'medication dose needs adjustment' awareness and 'medication dose adjustment at appropriate GFR level' knowledge. In addition, the overwhelming majority had incorrect knowledge across all levels of training. One possibility may be due to the limited exposure and infrequent prescribing of these medications by IM house-staff. Typically in academic settings, specialists (psychiatrists and neurologists) are involved with prescribing and initiating these medications. Another possibility is that some of these medications are controlled substances and may not be routinely prescribed by IM house-staff. This limited experience among IM house-staff for some of these medications may contribute to the overall poor scores for these medication classes. Outside of academic settings, generalists prescribe the majority (59 to 85%) of psychotropic medications in the US. However, studies report suboptimal dosing and duration with a lack of concordance between psychiatric diagnoses and prescribed psychotropic medications among generalists. This has resulted in recommendations for graduate medical education programs to place greater emphasis on fundamental prescribing practices for psychotropic drugs. Despite these recommendations, our results demonstrate poor knowledge about these medications among house-staff. With generalists responsible for the majority of these prescriptions, it is important that IM house-staff are aware of and adhere to dosing guidelines.

### Psychiatric genome-wide association study enrichment shows promise for future psychopharmaceutical discoveries [^27a14779]. Communications Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Psychiatric disorders account for over 14% of deathsand 10% of lost healthy years globally. Unfortunately, drug development to treat these disorders has stagnated. Indeed, the gaps in our understanding of the etiology of psychopathology has predominantly restricted medication development to a limited number of known pharmacologic drug targets (e.g. dopamine receptor 2 antagonists, selective serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors) that were often discovered by happenstance (e.g. treatments being developed to treat tuberculosis and pain were discovered to have antidepressantand antipsychotic properties, respectively). More recent developments have focused on reducing side effects associated with these medications and broadening their targets (e.g. serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors). As major treatment advances often directly target links within an etiologic chain (e.g. statins inhibiting cholesterol synthesis), leveraging our developing understanding of psychopathology to guide treatment development holds promise. As a cost-effective starting point for the process of psychopharmaceutical discovery, recent large-scale psychiatric genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reliably identified hundreds of common variants and pathways associated with risk –, that may be leveraged to prioritize drug targets for consideration in future drug repurposing studies as well as the development of treatments targeting novel mechanisms. For example, early research across various categories of broad indications (neurological disease, cardiovascular disease, etc.) found that medications acting on pathways implicated by GWAS are more likely to be approved therapeutics for diseases of that indication and progress further in clinical trials. More recently, GWAS have contributed to novel U.S. Food and Drug Administration(FDA) approved treatments for COVID-19. Despite observations that genes implicated in GWAS (e.g. DRD2) code for proteins that are primary medication targets, GWAS drug enrichment studies have yet to identify any currently approved treatments for psychiatric disorders. For example, The largest studies of bipolar disorder (BiP) and major depressive disorder (MDD) GWAS have been found to be enriched for other medication classes but not for medication classes shown to treat these disorders (e.g. BiP: psycho-epileptics; calcium channel blockers; MDD: estrogen targeting medications, and others). For MDD, smaller studies have found inconsistent enrichment of antidepressants. Further, when accounting for the number of targets of a treatment, there was no evidence of enrichment of current treatments for SCZ or BiP. To date, drug enrichment studies of specific psychiatric GWAS have used gene-set analyses that test whether genes coding for medication targets are enriched for genome-wide significance (GWS) relative to all other genes or a random set of genes. Positive results emerge when medication targets are overrepresented among genome-wide significant findings relative to non-medication targets. While the gene-set approach has many strengths, including its implementation as a post-GWAS annotation tool and application as an agnostic approach, it may bias against rediscovering current treatments, making the validity of psychiatric GWAS difficult to evaluate. Indeed, the identification of non-therapeutic targets within a GWAS is irrelevant to the presence of signals from medication targets. In other words, for a GWAS to identify a current medication target, it does not matter if the GWAS also identifies other non-targets. As such, while testing for enrichment of genes coding for medication targets relative to other genes may provide valid data for GWAS, it does not directly facilitate the identification of treatment targets. Further, evaluating enrichment for targets of currently approved psychiatric medications relative to non-targets could bias results toward the null due to the limited number of possible medication targets and the existence of well-powered GWAS that have identified many loci, mostly within non-drug targets.

### The burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors by state in the USA, 1990–2021: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2021 [^df15a7da]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

In addressing the disease burden in the USA, it is crucial to acknowledge the growing issue of drug use and addiction, a problem that has been largely exacerbated by the over-prescription of pain medications. The failure of pain clinics and other health providers to regulate the distribution of these medications has led to a widespread opioid crisis, resulting not only in increased addiction rates but also a substantial strain on our health-care system. In recent years, the increasing availability of cheaper, more potent alternatives such as fentanyl has worsened the problem even further. The policies needed to slow and ultimately reverse drug use trends in the USA include tightening regulations on prescription practices, investing in effective prevention and treatment programmes, and fostering a greater understanding of addiction as a public health concern rather than a criminal issue. Similarly, US authorities must redouble their efforts to control the flow of illegal drugs, which can be aided through international cooperation and intelligence-sharing among law enforcement agencies. By proactively addressing the root causes of drug addiction and implementing evidence-based policies, we can reverse the growing burden of drug use on Americans' health and avert an even more challenging future.

Mental health remains a stigmatised and under-addressed issue, and in the USA, is often segregated from physical health at both the programmatic level — with the US CDC focusing on physical health and SAMHSA focusing on mental health — and patient level, with limited coordination between primary care physicians and mental health doctors and treatment facilities. Policy makers and the public should push for a more comprehensive approach to health care that encompasses both mental and physical wellbeing, emphasising prevention, and ensuring that those without mental health issues remain healthy. The current system, where the CDC focuses primarily on physical health while SAMHSA combines mental health with substance abuse, only perpetuates the taboo that mental health issues inevitably lead to drug problems and vice versa. This flawed structure not only reinforces stigma but also hinders our ability to effectively tackle mental health challenges. To build a healthier, more resilient society, we must integrate mental health into all aspects of health care and prioritise preventive measures on national and state levels. However, there is limited knowledge surrounding preventive programmes for mental health. There is a pressing need for more research in this area to identify effective interventions and promote mental wellbeing to improve overall public health and quality of life.

### Opioid prescribing patterns among medical providers in the United States, 2003–17: retrospective, observational study [^bddb7bc2]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Abstract

Objective

To examine the distribution and patterns of opioid prescribing in the United States.

Design

Retrospective, observational study.

Setting

National private insurer covering all 50 US states and Washington DC.

Participants

An annual average of 669 495 providers prescribing 8.9 million opioid prescriptions to 3.9 million patients from 2003 through 2017.

Main outcome measures

Standardized doses of opioids in morphine milligram equivalents (MMEs) and number of opioid prescriptions.

Results

In 2017, the top 1% of providers accounted for 49% of all opioid doses and 27% of all opioid prescriptions. In absolute terms, the top 1% of providers prescribed an average of 748 000 MMEs — nearly 1000 times more than the middle 1%.

### Effect of age on the profile of psychotropic users: results from the 2010 national ambulatory medical care survey [^cd5d08f7]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2014). Low credibility.

Objectives

To describe the effect of age on psychotropic coprescribing, psychiatric diagnoses, and other clinical characteristics.

Design

Analysis of the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey.

Setting

A national sample of outpatient visits to physicians (N = 2,406) in office-based practice in 2010.

Participants

Adults prescribed psychotropic medication (N = 31,229).

Measurements

Office visits at which antidepressant, anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, antipsychotic, or mood stabilizer medications were prescribed were grouped according to participant age (21–64, ≥ 65) and then compared within each medication class on visit characteristics. and then compared according to variables including provider type, sex, and race; presence of diagnosed mental illness; prescription of other psychotropic agents; total number of chronic conditions; time spent with physician; and total number of medications.

Results

In 2010, there were 90.3 million antidepressant office visits; 77.7 million anxiolytic/sedative/hypnotic visits; 15.5 million antipsychotic visits; and 9.5 million mood stabilizer visits. Nonpsychiatrists prescribed the majority of psychotropic medications for every class and age group; 17.3% of older adult antipsychotic visits and 44.9% of younger adult antipsychotic visits were to a psychiatrist (chi-square = 19.58, P = 0.001). Older adults in every medication class were less likely to have a diagnosed mental disorder.

Conclusion

Older adults prescribed psychotropic medication were less likely to have a diagnosed mental disorder than their younger counterparts. Efforts to promote quality prescribing should seek to minimize nonspecific use of psychotropic medication.

### Improving adherence to therapy and clinical outcomes while containing costs: opportunities from the greater use of generic medications: best practice advice from the clinical guidelines committee of the American College of Physicians [^9c206df9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Areas of uncertainty and directions for the future — generic medications note that "Although rates of generic drug use have increased steadily over the past decade, substantial opportunities remain to increase the use of these medications even further and, in so doing, to maintain or improve health care quality while also reducing cost (6)." The report adds that "Given the large cost differences between generic and brand-name medications, even small incremental increases in the rate of generic dispensing are estimated to have important economic implications for both patients and payers (13)." It emphasizes that "patient and provider perceptions remain the major obstacle to increasing generic medication use" and that "increasing their use will require the development of more robust data about their comparative safety and effectiveness relative to their brand-name counterparts." It further states, "These data are especially urgent for widely used drug classes, such as antidepressants and thyroid hormone, for which beliefs about the differences between brand-name and generic drugs are strongly held (3, 29)," and concludes that "Incentives for providers and insurers introduced by payment reform, new funding sources for comparative effectiveness research, and advances in the methods to conduct these types of analyses should facilitate the generation of this evidence."

### Trajectories of prescription drug misuse among US adults from ages 18 to 50 years [^ddaa5512]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Conclusions

Medical use of controlled medications is most prevalent during middle and older adulthood. The high medication usage, limited screening, and lack of adequate monitoring practices have contributed to increases in PDM among older adults and historic highs in PDM-related emergency department visits, overdoses, and deaths. Indeed, the present study found evidence that approximately 46% of adults misused prescription medications at least once between the ages of 18 and 50 years. While substance use prevention during adolescence is a justified public health focus, clinicians, prescribers, and researchers must better understand long-term PDM trajectories to reduce PDM-related consequences in later adulthood. The findings of the present study indicate that some US adults do not report their most frequent misuse until later in life, which reinforces the importance of educating about and screening for PDM and SUD from adolescence through middle adulthood.

### Associations between sex, race / ethnicity, and age and the initiation of chronic high-risk medication in US older adults [^c01473bb]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2024). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

More than 20% of older adults in the United States (US) regularly use at least one high‐risk medication, with a prevalence that continues to increase. Although the risks can vary by medication class, their use has been thought to lead to many different adverse outcomes, such as drug‐related hospital admissions and functional decline. For example, sedative hypnotics and benzodiazepines have been shown to increase the risk of falling in older adults by 30%. Although some medications should be avoided in older adults at all times, others become particularly problematic when being used for extended periods due to their long‐term consequences (e.g. benzodiazepines vs. proton‐pump inhibitors [PPIs]) and increased risks of adverse events over time (e.g. nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]).

According to a recent systematic review, some of the most well‐known demographic and clinical factors among community‐dwelling US older adults associated with potentially inappropriate medication use include female sex, higher resource and medication use, and psychiatric comorbidities. For other key patient factors, like age and race/ethnicity, associations with inappropriate medication use among older adults have varied. Specifically, no specific race/ethnicity or age group has been consistently identified as being at greater risk of using high‐risk medications. These mixed associations across prior studies may be due to the heterogeneity of different medications in prior studies. Many prior studies have not included any race/ethnicity evaluations, which also limits the comparability. Furthermore, most prior studies have also not specifically focused on chronic high‐risk medication use.

Therefore, we sought to study the association between age, sex, race/ethnicity, and chronic use of a wide array of high‐risk medications in older adults who newly started using such medications. We hypothesized that there could be some key differences across sociodemographic subgroups that may be important for clinical and policy interventions that seek to reduce the chronic use of these medications.

### Characteristics of trials preceding FDA approval of novel psychiatric drugs [^fa86828b]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

In the past decade, a limited number of psychiatric drugs have been approved, and most of their mechanisms of action — involving serotonin, dopamine, and/or norepinephrine systems — are similar to drugs developed decades ago. Although most drugs were supported by multiple positive phase 3 trials, 3 had more negative or failed efficacy trials than positive ones, including 1 which was approved based on 2 positive trials in the context of 10 other negative or failed trials. Notably, only 1 of these 3 drugs was designated for expedited review. Limitations include results that may not be generalizable to drugs targeting other diseases (eg, movement and substance use–related disorders) and inclusion of prodrugs and drug combinations if at least one drug was an NME. The quality of evidence supporting psychiatric drug approvals varied substantially, underscoring the need for increased clarity and consistent application of FDA approval standards among drugs treating mental illnesses.

### Impact of the communities that HEAL intervention on buprenorphine-waivered practitioners and buprenorphine prescribing: a prespecified secondary analysis of the HCS randomized clinical trial [^44ad8b16]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Opioid use disorder is the only chronic medical illness for which access to highly effective medications has been restricted at the federal and state levels. Methadone can be dispensed only through opioid treatment programs. Until passage of the MAT Act, buprenorphine could be prescribed only by clinicians who completed a prerequisite training and were assigned a special DATA-Waiver registration number, in addition to the standard DEA number. Clinician level barriers to buprenorphine prescribing that hinder initiation of prescribing and contribute to relatively few patients treated by most prescribers need to be addressed. Barriers identified in earlier studies included the complexity of the waiver process itself, the lack of professional support and referral networks, challenges in getting started, and accessing reimbursement for treatment. Multilevel barriers to buprenorphine prescribing point to the need for multilevel interventions at the practitioner, health system, medical education, and policy levels to ensure low-barrier, widely accessible, and equitable access to this standard of care treatment. Such multilevel approaches need to motivate individual change, sharing success stories, humanizing patients with OUD, and implementing changes to medical education, health care delivery, and health policy changes. In the nonwaiver era, expanding and increasing support for practitioners from other parts of the health care system, such as behavioral health clinicians and pharmacists, and using a whole health model merits consideration.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also help to explain our null findings. While in the US overall, the number of newly waivered clinicians slowed initially during the pandemic, the number of clinicians with 100- and 275-patient limit waivers increased. In our study, rates of waivered prescribers increased in both study conditions from baseline to the comparison period, but there were no significant differences between the 2 conditions during the comparison period. In addition, the weekly number of individuals filling buprenorphine prescriptions in the US plateaued relative to prepandemic rate increases. In our study, the proportion of waivered prescribers who prescribed buprenorphine decreased between the baseline and comparison periods; thus, increases in waivered prescribers did not increase prescription rates. These observed trends in the general US population and our results suggest that clinicians who were already prescribing made efforts to continue and expand, including through telemedicine, but that the unprecedented COVID-19–related burdens on the health care system may have slowed the pace of clinicians initiating buprenorphine prescribing.

Because these medications are recommended to be used not at all, with caution, or for a short duration in the older adult population, identifying prescribing trends can highlight where deprescribing efforts should be targeted. The objectives of this research were to describe the prescribing trends and prevalence, per physician specialty type and US region and to estimate the aggregate costs of PPIs, APs and BZRAs based on Medicare Part D claims in beneficiaries ≥ 65 years.

### Drug prescriptions and dementia incidence: a medication-wide association study of 17000 dementia cases among half a million participants [^5572e380]. Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health (2022). Medium credibility.

Evaluating the results

One reason a medication may be associated with dementia is because it is prescribed for a condition that is itself associated with dementia (confounding by indication). Two clinicians (TW and KB) screened all associated medications, highlighting those that are commonly prescribed in one of five situations ('Group 1'): neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression and symptoms or complications of dementia (eg, antipsychotics or nutritional supplements). This list was not designed to include all conditions that are associated with dementia, but rather to provide a framework to aid interpretation and reporting of the results.

For each of the remaining associated medications ('Group 2'), we compared the HRs to those of all other drugs within the same BNF section to look for patterns and generate hypotheses. We considered whether HRs of medications in the same section were similar, even if small sample sizes precluded some from meeting the threshold for significance.

### Incident and long-term opioid therapy among patients with psychiatric conditions and medications: a national study of commercial health care claims [^b095b60d]. Pain (2017). Low credibility.

There is growing evidence that opioid prescribing in the United States follows a pattern in which patients who are at the highest risk of adverse outcomes from opioids are more likely to receive long-term opioid therapy. These patients include, in particular, those with substance use disorders (SUDs) and other psychiatric conditions. This study examined health insurance claims among 10,311,961 patients who filled prescriptions for opioids. Specifically, we evaluated how opioid receipt differed among patients with and without a wide range of preexisting psychiatric and behavioral conditions (ie, opioid and nonopioid SUDs, suicide attempts or other self-injury, motor vehicle crashes, and depressive, anxiety, and sleep disorders) and psychoactive medications (ie, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, hypnotics, mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and medications used for SUD, tobacco cessation, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder). Relative to those without, patients with all assessed psychiatric conditions and medications had modestly greater odds of subsequently filling prescriptions for opioids and, in particular, substantially greater risk of long-term opioid receipt. Increases in risk for long-term opioid receipt in adjusted Cox regressions ranged from approximately 1.5-fold for prior attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder medication prescriptions (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.53; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.48–1.58) to approximately 3-fold for prior nonopioid SUD diagnoses (HR = 3.15; 95% CI, 3.06–3.24) and nearly 9-fold for prior opioid use disorder diagnoses (HR = 8.70; 95% CI, 8.20–9.24). In sum, we found evidence of greater opioid receipt among commercially insured patients with a breadth of psychiatric conditions. Future studies assessing behavioral outcomes associated with opioid prescribing should consider preexisting psychiatric conditions.

### Trends in use of medications associated with women's ambulatory care visits [^bd03688e]. Journal of Women's Health (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Data from the CDC's National Health Care Survey (NHCS) can assist researchers studying women's healthcare utilization.

Methods

Using data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS), component surveys of the NHCS, this paper presents prescribing trends from 1995 to 2000 for the 10 therapeutic drug classes of medications mentioned most often during women's ambulatory care visits.

Results

Antidepressants top the list as the most frequently mentioned therapeutic class in 1999–2000, followed by estrogens and progestins, antiarthritics, and drugs for acid/peptic disorders. The number of medications prescribed increased by about 13% during visits by women to physicians' offices and hospital outpatient departments between 1995–1996 and 1999–2000, from 144 to 162 mentions per 100 visits, respectively.

Conclusions

Researchers can use the NHCS to track changes in use over time and to target potential issues related to access to care, quality of care, or cost that warrant further, in-depth study.

### Assuring safety of inherently unsafe medications: the FDA risk evaluation and mitigation strategies [^0661df97]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

The decision to approve a drug for clinical use is based on an understanding of its benefits versus the risks. Although efficacy is generally understood at the time of submission to the FDA for approval, the risks are more difficult to assess. Both PubMed (from 2000 to 2012) and the FDA website (www.fda.gov) were searched using the search terms "risk evaluation and mitigation strategy" (REMS). Articles for review were selected by relevance to topic, and their references were searched as well for additional relevant resources. Since the search results were not expected to contain research studies, formal quality assessment and inclusion and exclusion criteria were not utilized resulting in a narrative review. Few directly relevant research studies exist, although supporting documents such as government reports were available. For effective drugs with unclear or concerning safety records, the FDA has the option of requiring a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, which allows a systematic approach to track and assure safe medication use. Over 100 different medications are currently covered by REMS, and each REMS is developed individually based on the needs of the specific drug or class. Although likely associated with improvements in medication safety, the potential benefit, limitations, and consequences of REMS are not yet fully understood.

### Prescribing prevalence of medications with potential genotype-guided dosing in pediatric patients [^dfff3f41]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Pharmacogenetics is a key component of precision medicine that uses genetic information to guide drug selection and dosing decisions. More than 100 commercially available drugs in the US contain pharmacogenetic information in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) label, including therapeutic management recommendations and warnings about the potential effects on drug safety, response, or potential alterations in pharmacokinetic parameters. The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) publishes evidence-based, drug-centric, peer-reviewed guidelines for how to translate genetic test results into actionable prescribing decisions. During the last decade, CPIC has published guidelines on more than 35 gene-drug pairs as CPIC level A, indicating that a prescribing action is recommended when genotype information is available and that the preponderance of evidence is high or moderate in favor of changing prescribing.

Although most pharmacogenetic research to date has focused on adults, the potential benefits of genotype-guided therapy in children are increasingly recognized. Many CPIC guidelines suggest application of genotype-guided therapy in both adults and children, whereas some CPIC guidelines contain unique recommendations for children (eg, voriconazole, atomoxetine, and warfarin), owing to ontogeny or other pediatric considerations. There is at least 1 example of a greater effect of a pharmacogenetic variant in children than adults that involves the drug transporter SLCO1B1 and simvastatin. Thus, the opportunity exists for more personalized pharmacotherapy in the pediatric population; however, widespread clinical implementation is challenging.

Data on trends of the prevalence of relevant prescriptions over time are crucial to informing pharmacogenetic implementation. The utility of pharmacogenetic testing depends on the frequency of prescribed medications with an actionable association and can rapidly change with the introduction of new drugs, the availability of generics or different formulations, changes in pricing, revised FDA guidance, and decisions by health care payers, health care institutions, and prescribers. Prescribing trends can also inform which genes to test, the opportunity for reuse of results during a lifetime (when a second drug associated with the same gene is prescribed), and the use of multigene panel-based tests.

### Association of the US food and drug administration antipsychotic drug boxed warning with medication use and health outcomes in elderly patients with dementia [^ec806489]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Medication Use

The prevalence of AAP use decreased −0.15 percentage points (95% CI, −4.32 to 4.02 percentage points) in 2005 and continued to decrease −0.18 percentage points annually after 2005 (95% CI, −0.68 to 0.32 percentage points) (Figure 1). Results based on the NAMCS and NHAMCS data were more pronounced, with a level change of −0.54 percentage points (95% CI, −3.18 to 2.10 percentage points) and a postwarning slope of −0.83 percentage points (95% CI, −1.27 to −0.39 percentage points). The decrease in AAP use after 2005 was accompanied by changes in use of other psychiatric medications (which included typical antipsychotics, hypnotics, antidepressants, antiepileptics, and antidementia agents) and opioids (Figure 2). The prevalence of use of any psychiatric medication or opioid increased by 0.48 percentage points (95% CI, −8.45 to 9.40 percentage points) in 2005 and continued to increase by 0.67 percentage points (95% CI, 0.34–1.01 percentage points) annually. We observed similar trends using data from the NAMCS and NHAMCS sample. When data were analyzed by drug class, we observed that the prevalence of antiepileptic use increased by 2.23 percentage points (95% CI, −0.98 to 5.44 percentage points) in 2005 and continued to increase at a rate of 1.21 percentage points (95% CI, 0.66–1.76 percentage points) per year. Although stable before 2005, the prevalence of opioid use decreased by −1.14 percentage points (95% CI, −4.73 to 2.45 percentage points) in 2005 but increased by 1.29 percentage points (95% CI, 1.01–1.58 percentage points) annually. However, in the NAMCS and NHAMCS, the prevalence of opioid use was lower (Figure 2). The prevalence of opioid use increased by 0.28 percentage points (95% CI, −0.03 to 0.58 percentage points) before 2005 and by 0.63 percentage points (95% CI, 0.13–1.12 percentage points) after 2005, but the slope change was not statistically significant. The prevalence of antidementia medication use continued to increase after 2005 but at a slower pace (eFigure in the Supplement).

### Use of sleep medications in hospitalized pediatric patients [^e1bafc25]. Pediatrics (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

Little is known about the medications prescribed for sleep in hospitalized children. The aims of this study were to (1) determine the percentage of hospitalized children who receive medication for sleep disturbances, (2) determine what medications are prescribed for sleep difficulties, and (3) examine medical and demographic variables related to medications prescribed during hospitalization.

Patients and Methods

A chart review was conducted for all inpatients at 3 pediatric hospitals across 26 randomly selected days in 2004. Demographic, medical, and medication data were collected on 9440 patients. The sample was 54.5% male, had a mean age of 7.0 years, and was 63% white. Almost 19% of the patients had at least 1 psychiatric diagnosis.

Results

Overall, 6.0% of all hospitalized children (3% of all medically hospitalized children, excluding children with a psychiatric diagnosis) were prescribed medications for sleep, with antihistamines the most frequently prescribed medication (36.6%), followed by benzodiazepines (19.4%); hypnotic agents were the least frequently prescribed (2.2%). Significant differences were found in both the frequency of sleep-medication prescriptions and the types of medications used across hospitals, as well as for age, length of hospitalization, and service that the child was discharged from. Children with a psychiatric diagnosis were more likely to receive a sleep medication, with 22% of children on a psychiatric service receiving a sleep-related medication.

Conclusions

Approximately 3% to 6% of children are treated pharmacologically with a broad array of sleep medications in hospital settings. Prescription practices vary by hospital, medical service, child age, and diagnosis. The results from this study indicate that medications are being prescribed for sleep in hospitalized children, especially in children with psychiatric diagnoses. However, given that there are neither Food and Drug Administration-approved sleep medications for children nor clinical consensus guidelines regarding their use, clinical trials, practice guidelines, and additional research are clearly needed.

### Examining psychotropic medication use among youth in the U.S. by race / ethnicity and psychological impairment [^0f1bbbcf]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

Clinical practice guidelines underscore the need for careful evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio of psychotropic medications treating mental health disorders among youth. While it is well known that racial/ethnic disparities exist in psychotropic medication use, little is known about whether these differences are driven by over-prescribing among white youth, under-prescribing among minority youth, or both. To build evidence in this area, this study examined racial/ethnic differences in the prescription of psychotropic medications among youth with and without psychological impairment.

Methods

Secondary data on two-year medication use from the 2004–2011 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys were analyzed. We capitalized on two-year panel data, creating variables that allow for differential sequencing of psychological impairment and medication prescription (e.g., impairment in year 1 or year 2, and a psychotropic medication fill in year 2). Statistical differences were determined using unadjusted rate comparisons and logistic regression models, after adjustment for socio-contextual and health status characteristics.

Results

Compared to Black and Latino youth with psychological impairment, White youth were more likely to be prescribed psychotropic medications when impaired. Among youth never having psychological impairment, White youth were also more likely to be prescribed medications compared to their racial/ethnic minority counterparts.

Conclusions

Differences in rates of medication use among youth with and without impairment suggest poor medication targeting across racial/ethnic groups. These results, combined with recent psychotropic medication risk warnings and concerns over increases in psychotropic medication use among youth, suggest that a continued emphasis on accurate targeting of prescribing patterns is needed across racial/ethnic groups.

### Update on cognitive enhancers among the older adult population: a clinical review [^32a82212]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The purpose of this review is to identify key classes of medications that are used for the treatment of older adults with neurocognitive disorders.

Recent Findings

Clinical factors play a critical role in the prescribing of these medication classes for the treatment of dementia. The variation in prescribing trends is determined by the presence of medical and psychiatric comorbidities commonly occurring in older adults and is based on the consideration of potential interactions between pharmacotherapies for the comorbidities and for the dementia. Six medication classes currently exist to address the neurocognitive aspect of dementia, with varying pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. We review these six classes in this report and provide a provision of clinical insights regarding the use of these agents. While literature exists on the safety and efficacy of individual medication options for the treatment of dementia in the older adult population, further research is needed to provide clearer guidance regarding the specific use of these agents in clinical practice.

### Optimal pediatric outpatient antibiotic prescribing [^9e215ddd]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Antibiotics are among the most commonly prescribed medications in US individuals younger than 18 years, with a national average of 598 prescriptions per 1000 persons in 2022. Clinicians in the Southeast prescribe the highest volume of antibiotics per capita nationwide, and the state of Tennessee consistently ranks among the top 10 highest prescribing states. In 2016, the antibiotic prescribing rate for pediatric outpatients in Tennessee was 50% higher than the national average. Downstream outcomes of antibiotic overuse include antimicrobial resistance, adverse medication effects, and chronic conditions secondary to microbiome alterations, such as inflammatory bowel disease and asthma. Additionally, it is estimated that 80% of antibiotic consumption occurs in the outpatient setting. Thus, outpatient antimicrobial stewardship is of particular importance, and identifying factors in suboptimal antibiotic prescribing will allow health departments and stewardship programs in high-prescribing states to target, design, and implement future interventions.

Despite national efforts to reduce the quantity and improve the quality of outpatient antibiotic prescribing, the estimated percentage of visits with prescribed antibiotics remains high (15%-34% of clinical encounters). The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other institutions estimate that 50% or more of prescribed antibiotics are either unnecessary or inappropriate. Typically, such studies estimate antibiotic appropriateness using a previously developed antibiotic tier systemor evaluate appropriateness for specific disease processes, such as acute respiratory infections. However, these studies often define appropriateness based on clinician-level or encounter-level prescribing rates, or the presence of any antibiotic prescription. Some studies evaluate optimal antibiotic choice, but few studies consider both optimal antibiotic choice and duration. Evaluations are lacking of optimal antibiotic prescribing at the clinical encounter level across an entire state. The primary objective of this study was to identify the overall percentage of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions that are optimal according to guideline recommendations for first-line antibiotic choice and duration.

### Patterns in outpatient benzodiazepine prescribing in the United States [^d2f81930]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Use by Physician Specialty and Indication

After stratifying visits by specialty, visits to PCPs accounted for about half of all benzodiazepine visits (52.3% [95% CI, 50.0%-54.6%]; changing from 51.4% [95% CI, 43.1%-61.2%] in 2003 to 47.7% [95% CI, 38.0%-57.1%] in 2015), followed by visits to medical specialists (22.0% [95% CI, 20.1%-24.1%]; changing from 17.4% [95% CI, 12.6%-24.0%] to 20.9% [95% CI, 14.6%-29.2%]), psychiatrists (16.6% [95% CI, 15.2%-18.2%]; changing from 24.3% [95% CI, 17.8%-32.2%] to 18.8% [95% CI, 12.2%-26.0%]), and surgeons (9.1% [95% CI, 8.2%-9.9%]; changing from 5.8% [95% CI, 3.5%-10.0%] to 13.1% [95% CI, 9.9%-17.9%]) (Figure 2). The unadjusted benzodiazepine visit rate did not change among visits to psychiatrists (29.6% [95% CI, 23.3%-36.7%] to 30.2% [95% CI, 25.6%-35.2%]; P = 0.90), but increased among visits to PCPs (3.6% [95% CI, 2.9%-4.4%] to 7.5% [95% CI, 6.0%-9.5%]; P < .001), surgeons (1.0% [95% CI, 0.6%-1.6%] to 4.3% [95% CI, 3.5%-5.5%]; P < .001), and medical specialists (3.3% [95% CI, 2.4%-4.5%] to 6.0% [95% CI, 4.5%-7.9%]; P < .001) (for year-by-year estimates, see eTable 3 in the Supplement).

### Patterns in outpatient benzodiazepine prescribing in the United States [^cd4a2818]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

Using nationally representative data, we surveyed the landscape of outpatient benzodiazepine use and found that the rate for benzodiazepine visits doubled from 2003 to 2015. Use among psychiatrists was stable, but increased among all other types of physicians, including PCPs, medical specialists, and surgeons. By indication, use was stable for visits related to insomnia and increased by only about one-quarter for visits related to anxiety or neurologic conditions; in contrast, it more than doubled for back and chronic pain as well for other conditions for which we could not identify a specific indication. In addition, benzodiazepines are increasingly prescribed with other sedating medications.

The rising rate of overdose mortality involving benzodiazepines is likely multifactorial, but our results provide insights into potential underlying causes. A previous studyshowed that the benzodiazepine visit rate increased from 2.6% in 1993 to 4.4% in 2010. We extended these results by looking at more recent data through 2015 (showing that the rate continued to increase to 7.4%), stratifying visits by specialty and by indication and examining coprescribing in greater depth. The increase in the number of benzodiazepine visits likely reflects not only a growing number of unique individuals receiving benzodiazepines, but also an increase in those who are receiving benzodiazepines on a long-term basis. Other studies using pharmaceutical claims data and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey support the conclusion that long-term benzodiazepine use may be a larger driver of the increased use of this class of medications. This finding is of even greater concern because little evidence supports the use of benzodiazepines past 8 or 10 weeks, as suggested by US Food and Drug Administration labeling and several disease-specific clinical guidelines.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^df63fca7]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Pain management in patients with depression — depression, anxiety, and other mood disorders are linked to acute and chronic pain due to injury. Nearly one in five American adults is prescribed psychotropic medication, and up to 36% of patients are prescribed psychotropics prior to traumatic brain injury (TBI). Abrupt discontinuation of psychotropic medications may cause withdrawal and is associated with increased psychiatric symptoms in hospitalized patients. In general, restart psychotropic medications as soon as possible after admission. However, because psychotropic medications may increase the risk of injury, particularly due to falls in the older adult, conduct a risk-benefit analysis of medication continuation in consultation with the patient's primary care provider or psychiatry. In one study with more than 4,000 orthopaedic trauma patients, a history of depression was documented in about 4% of them; among those with a documented depression history, two-thirds had a documented median delay of 24 hours (range 0–14 days) before their psychotropic medications were restarted, and patients with a history of depression or anxiety had a 32% longer length of stay. Patients with pre-injury depression are also more likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms after injury.

### Patterns in outpatient benzodiazepine prescribing in the United States [^0ac2e773]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Examination of trends in use by specialty and indication revealed important patterns with respect to how benzodiazepines are used and prescribed. First, although use has increased among all specialties except psychiatry, primary care may be the source of the plurality, if not most, of benzodiazepine prescriptions. Second, although a modest increase occurred in use for anxiety and unchanged use for insomnia, we found that benzodiazepine use for back and chronic pain as well as undefined indications increased by a much larger degree. One possibility that might explain these trends is the greater availability and effectiveness of other classes of medications for anxiety and insomnia, while the options for pain remain more limited. Our understanding of the opioid epidemic may also be instructive. In particular, these trends could reflect an underappreciation of the risks associated with benzodiazepines and an overappreciation of the benefits, given their rapid therapeutic effects, marketing techniques used by the pharmaceutical industry, greater frequency with which anxiety or other "diseases of despair" are manifesting themselves in presentations to primary care, and poor availability of or access to pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic alternatives. Moreover, as opioids lose favor among prescribers, we must remain cognizant that this might lead to increased use of other potentially dangerous drugs such as benzodiazepines, especially because evidence for their use in conditions such as back pain is limited. Ultimately, any efforts to address or curb benzodiazepine use should address use within primary care, for instance through the development of benzodiazepine-specific guidelines or better tracking via prescription monitoring programs.

Although our study does not separate appropriate vs inappropriate use, the risks of benzodiazepines more likely outweigh the benefits when they are used in combination with other CNS depressants. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and US Food and Drug Administration issued warnings in 2016 to make prescribers and patients aware of these risks. Previous studies found that coprescribing with opioids is common. Those studies, however, did not examine coprescribing with other sedating medications and focused on overlapping prescriptions periods, which could be the result of prescriptions given to a patient at different times or by different prescribers. Our study showed that, within a visit, coprescribing has increased for not only benzodiazepines and opioids, but also benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine sedative hypnotics, muscle relaxants, and antipsychotics.

### Mental health-related outpatient visits among adolescents and young adults, 2006–2019 [^71bd6bd9]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Outpatient Visits Associated With Psychotropic Medications

Among all outpatient visits for adolescents and young adults, 17.2% were associated with the prescription of at least 1 psychotropic medication, and 6.6% with 2 or more. Antidepressants were the most commonly prescribed medication class (7.8% of all visits), followed by stimulants (6.2%), anxiolytics (4.4%), antipsychotics (2.5%), and mood stabilizers (2.1%). The percentage of visits associated with the prescription of a psychotropic medication increased significantly over the study period, from 12.8% in 2006 to 22.4% in 2019 (P < .001) (Figure 2).

Figure 2.
Prevalence of Mental Health–Related Outpatient Visits Among Adolescents and Young Adults by Sex

Significant increases were seen for both sexes.

Among visits associated with a mental health diagnosis, medication use was highest for visits with behavioral conditions (84.5%), mood disorders (76.2%), and substance use (74.0%) (Table 3). Among visits by adolescent patients, males were prescribed psychiatric medications more frequently than females (79.8% vs 72.7%; P = 0.047). There were no sex-based differences in overall medication prescribing among young adult patients. When examining specific psychiatric diagnosis categories, visits by young adult females with behavioral disorders were associated with higher rates of psychotropic medication use compared with those by young adult males (90.8% vs 82.4%; P = 0.007). In addition, visits by adolescent males with other diagnoses were associated with higher rates of psychotropic medication prescribing compared with those by females (82.8% vs 50.6%; P < .001).

### Opioid prescribing patterns among medical providers in the United States, 2003–17: retrospective, observational study [^299e50da]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

For these reasons, data driven policy demands a careful examination of opioid prescribing patterns over a broader range of time, geography, and population. Previous studies directly examining the distribution of opioid prescriptions among providers have been limited to geographically or demographically narrow samples of providers or patients, over shorter periods. This study seeks to fill these gaps, provide clarity to policy makers, and assist institutions with efforts to prioritize reduction. We examined a repository of prescription claims from a large, national insurance provider covering more than 60 million unique individuals from 2003 to 2017. The insured population includes all 50 US states and Washington DC and is of similar age and sex to the US general population. Using these data, we identified whether opioids are roughly equally prescribed across US medical providers or disproportionately prescribed by a small subset of providers, how prescribing patterns have changed over time, the extent to which top prescribers and top receiving patients persisted over time, and the relationship between high prescribing and top receiving patients.

### Geriatric trauma management [^469b17bf]. ACS (2023). High credibility.

Prescription drug misuse — older adults have higher rates of medication use and are at risk for inappropriate use, which may occur unintentionally, and medications prescribed for particular conditions may be misused to manage sleep, pain, or depression (e.g., benzodiazepines and opioids). Multiple prescribers increase the risk for dangerous drug interactions, and risk factors for misuse or abuse may include female gender, major social or economic losses, and history of psychiatric and/or substance use problems. Older adults may also be at increased risk for opioid use disorder due to the population's higher prevalence of pain and pain-related medical encounters. If an older trauma patient has long-term prescription opioid use, utilize consulting services to address pain management and/or underlying psychiatric conditions in the context of the trauma admission.
