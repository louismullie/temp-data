## Question

Differentials for a 2 year old with a chief complaint of "holding in his urine and crying when going to the bathroom"

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis for a 2-year-old who is holding in urine and crying with voiding. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core clinical problem and how to frame it diagnostically. Then, I should prioritize the differential by likelihood and severity, starting with infectious and inflammatory causes, followed by functional and behavioral etiologies, then mechanical or anatomic obstruction, and finally neurologic and systemic contributors. Next, I will outline the initial evaluation strategy, including history, exam, and targeted testing. Finally, I will consider red flags, management implications, and when to escalate to imaging or specialty referral, making sure I verify each claim against guidelines and key studies as I go.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. "Holding in urine" in a toddler often reflects dysuria or discomfort with voiding, and crying with urination points toward pain, which together suggest lower urinary tract irritation or obstruction. I should keep both infectious and noninfectious causes in mind, and I need to remember that in children, symptoms are often nonspecific and overlap with systemic illness, so I should not anchor prematurely on a single diagnosis [^9a9aff66] [^f2f7e532].

> I will now examine the most likely etiologies, starting with urinary tract infection. In verbal children, dysuria and frequency increase the likelihood of UTI, and in this age group, E. coli predominates. I should confirm with urinalysis and culture because diagnosis requires pyuria and bacteriuria at ≥ 50,000 CFU/mL of a single uropathogen, and I should avoid overcalling asymptomatic bacteriuria, which lacks pyuria and may not benefit from treatment [^f2f7e532] [^ce643685] [^2aa98caf]. Wait, let me verify the collection method: in non–toilet-trained toddlers, catheterization or suprapubic aspiration is preferred to avoid bag contamination, whereas midstream clean-catch is reasonable if reliably achieved [^75568559] [^d19bbcb1].

> Next, I should review balanoposthitis and other local inflammatory causes. In boys, inflammation of the glans and foreskin can cause significant dysuria and retention behaviors; this is a common cause of pediatric retention in some series, and I need to check the penis carefully for erythema, edema, and discharge. Gentle topical care and analgesia often suffice, but I should confirm there is no associated meatal stenosis or other obstruction before concluding it is purely inflammatory [^f76c195f].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about behavior without excluding constipation and bladder–bowel dysfunction. Chronic constipation and fecal impaction can compress the bladder outlet and precipitate retention or staccato voiding with pain; I should ask about stool frequency, consistency, and straining, and perform a careful abdominal and rectal exam. Treating constipation often resolves urinary symptoms, and this linkage is well described in pediatric urology and gastroenterology literature [^0e258bbf] [^4789972a] [^b8c0fbe3].

> I need to check for functional or behavioral voiding dysfunction, including "lazy voiders" and toilet-training–related withholding. Toddlers may hold urine due to anxiety, pain anticipation, or environmental stressors, leading to large residuals and urgency with discomfort. Timed voiding, positive reinforcement, and addressing constipation are foundational, and I should confirm there is no organic obstruction before labeling as functional [^c87295bd] [^acf559ab].

> But wait, what if the crying reflects mechanical obstruction rather than infection or behavior. I should consider urethral stricture, posterior urethral valves, or other congenital anomalies, especially if there is a weak stream, straining, or a history of UTIs. Urethral stricture belongs on the differential for decreased stream, incomplete emptying, dysuria, and rising post-void residual, and guidelines support including it early when symptoms fit, with uroflow and imaging as indicated [^18998d82] [^5b660a26]. In infants and toddlers, congenital obstructive lesions and even rare entities like Cowper's duct syringocele can present with retention and dysuria, so I should maintain a low threshold for urologic evaluation if the story is atypical or persistent [^b5864137].

> I should double-check for neurologic causes, even though they are less common at this age. Acute urinary retention in children can signal neurogenic bladder or spinal cord pathology; if there are gait changes, constipation, or recurrent retention, I need to consider MRI of the brain and spine to exclude entities like ADEM, transverse myelitis, or meningitis–retention syndrome, particularly when the presentation is atypical or refractory to simple measures [^5fc81c9e] [^1ce789b1].

> Let me consider systemic and metabolic contributors. Viral illnesses, including EBV, can rarely cause atonic bladder and retention; I should correlate with systemic symptoms and lymphadenopathy. Additionally, dietary extremes such as ketogenic or very-low-carbohydrate intake can induce osmotic diuresis and bladder irritability, so I should ask about recent dietary changes if polyuria or frequency is prominent, even though this is not classic for painful voiding [^a2cb0c4f] [^d37b118d].

> Next, I should review the initial evaluation strategy. I need a focused history of fever, dysuria, frequency, stooling pattern, toilet-training status, trauma, and medication exposures; on exam, I should assess hydration, abdominal tenderness, suprapubic distension, and perform a careful genital exam for balanoposthitis, meatal stenosis, or vulvovaginitis. I should obtain urinalysis and urine culture when UTI is suspected, using catheterization or suprapubic aspiration if needed, and consider renal and bladder ultrasound if symptoms persist, recur, or if there are red flags for obstruction or upper tract involvement [^75568559] [^ef07cae8].

> Hold on, I should verify red flags that mandate expedited imaging or specialty referral. These include recurrent retention, palpable bladder, weak or interrupted stream, failure to respond to initial therapy, concern for neurogenic bladder, or abnormal renal function. In such cases, renal and bladder ultrasound is appropriate, and VCUG is reserved for specific indications such as hydronephrosis, scarring, or recurrent febrile UTI rather than routine use after a first UTI [^f525ca38] [^8f689214].

> I will now examine management implications by likely diagnosis. If UTI is confirmed, I should treat with appropriate antibiotics guided by culture, ensure close follow-up, and consider imaging if the UTI is febrile, recurrent, or complicated. If balanoposthitis is present, topical hygiene and analgesia are first-line. If constipation is identified, aggressive bowel management is essential. If functional voiding dysfunction is suspected, behavioral strategies and constipation therapy are key. If obstruction is found, urologic intervention may be required, and I should coordinate timely referral [^ce643685] [^b8c0fbe3] [^18998d82].

> Let me reconsider the differential synthesis to ensure internal consistency. The most likely causes in a 2-year-old with crying and holding behaviors are UTI, local inflammatory balanoposthitis or vulvovaginitis, constipation with bladder–bowel dysfunction, and functional withholding related to toilet training. Less common but important considerations include urethral stricture or other congenital obstruction, neurogenic bladder, and systemic or viral etiologies. I should tailor testing to pretest probabilities and escalate promptly if red flags emerge [^f76c195f] [^9690fc90] [^18998d82].

In a 2-year-old with urine holding and crying during voiding, the most likely causes are **UTI** [^f2f7e532], **constipation-related bladder dysfunction** [^0e258bbf], and **meatal stenosis** [^notfound]. Other considerations include **balanoposthitis** [^f76c195f], **vulvovaginitis** [^f76c195f], **urethral stricture** [^18998d82], **neurogenic bladder** [^1ce789b1], and **behavioral withholding** [^c87295bd]. Evaluate with urinalysis and culture [^42244369], renal/bladder ultrasound [^ef07cae8], and a focused exam for constipation, meatal stenosis, or genital inflammation [^f76c195f]; treat the underlying cause and address constipation to relieve symptoms [^b8c0fbe3].

---

## Infectious and inflammatory causes

- **Urinary tract infection (UTI)**: Common in this age group; dysuria, frequency, urgency, and crying during voiding are typical [^f2f7e532]. UTIs are more frequent in girls and uncircumcised boys [^f2f7e532].

- **Balanoposthitis**: Inflammation of the glans and foreskin causing pain and reluctance to void; often due to poor hygiene or irritation [^notfound].

- **Vulvovaginitis**: Inflammation of the vulva and vagina causing dysuria and urinary retention; common in young girls [^notfound].

- **Urethritis**: Inflammation of the urethra causing dysuria and urinary retention; may be infectious or noninfectious [^acf2b09c].

---

## Structural and mechanical causes

- **Meatal stenosis**: Narrowing of the urethral meatus causing obstruction and painful urination; more common in boys [^notfound].

- **Urethral stricture**: Congenital or acquired narrowing of the urethra causing obstruction and painful urination [^18998d82].

- **Posterior urethral valves**: Congenital obstruction in boys causing urinary retention and difficulty voiding [^notfound].

- **Bladder diverticulum**: Congenital outpouching of the bladder causing urinary retention and recurrent infections [^95411e1d].

---

## Functional and behavioral causes

Functional and behavioral causes include **constipation-related bladder dysfunction**, in which chronic constipation causes bladder irritation and dysfunction, leading to urinary retention and painful urination [^0e258bbf]. Behavioral withholding occurs when children voluntarily hold urine due to pain, fear, or anxiety, often associated with toilet training [^c87295bd]. Dysfunctional voiding involves abnormal bladder and sphincter coordination, causing urinary retention and painful urination [^b8c0fbe3].

---

## Neurological causes

Neurological causes include **neurogenic bladder**, in which spinal cord abnormalities or neurological disorders cause bladder dysfunction, urinary retention, and painful urination [^1ce789b1]. Sacral agenesis is a congenital absence of the sacrum causing neurogenic bladder and urinary retention [^notfound].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A **systematic diagnostic approach** is essential:

| **Step** | **Evaluation** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Detailed history | Identify symptoms, duration, associated factors (constipation, fever, trauma), toilet training status [^9a9aff66] |
| 2 | Physical examination | Assess for abdominal distension, palpable bladder, constipation, genital abnormalities, meatal stenosis, balanoposthitis, vulvovaginitis [^f76c195f] |
| 3 | Urinalysis and urine culture | Detect UTI, pyuria, bacteriuria [^42244369] |
| 4 | Renal and bladder ultrasound | Identify structural abnormalities, hydronephrosis, bladder wall thickening, post-void residual urine [^ef07cae8] |
| 5 | Voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) | Detect vesicoureteral reflux, posterior urethral valves, urethral strictures [^notfound] |
| 6 | Urodynamic studies | Evaluate bladder function, neurogenic bladder [^b8c0fbe3] |

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **UTI**: Antibiotic therapy based on culture results [^4c1dd37b].

- **Constipation**: Dietary modifications, laxatives, bowel regimen [^notfound].

- **Meatal stenosis**: Topical steroids, meatotomy if severe [^notfound].

- **Neurogenic bladder**: Intermittent catheterization, anticholinergic medications, urology referral [^914b4a7e].

- **Behavioral withholding**: Behavioral therapy, bladder training, constipation management [^0d40318d].

---

## Conclusion

In a 2-year-old with urine holding and crying during voiding, the most likely causes are UTI, constipation-related bladder dysfunction, and meatal stenosis. A **structured evaluation** with history, exam, urinalysis, and imaging guides diagnosis and management, with treatment tailored to the cause and constipation addressed in all cases [^b8c0fbe3].

### A 16-year-old boy with acute urinary retention [^acf559ab]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Urinary retention can be described as the inability to void volitionally despite an adequate volume of urine in the bladder. It is a common complaint in adults, especially among elderly males with benign prostatic hyperplasia. Children, in contrast, are more likely to have voluntary retention of urine due to urethral irritation or dysuria. Gently massaging the suprapubic region while the child is in a warm bath often relieves the retention in these cases. Other patients described as lazy voiders can present with acute urinary retention. These patients are typically young girls who are embarrassed to void at school. Retraining or timed voiding is often successful managing lazy voiders. However, these benign disorders should only be diagnosed after anatomical or organic causes for their symptoms have been considered and ruled out.

We present an adolescent girl with a 1-day history of acute urinary retention and lower abdominal pain. She was admitted to the paediatric ward for ongoing treatment and investigations. Due to a myriad of factors including pain and anxiety, challenges posed included an incomplete initial abdominal and external genital examination. This case report highlights the importance of a focused history and performing an appropriate sensitive examination at the time of presentation. Furthermore, we explore the common causes of new onset urinary retention and unravel the case as it unfolds. We also highlight differential diagnoses (however, uncommon), which must be considered and not overlooked to avoid unnecessary investigations and to ensure timely management.

### Dysuria: evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults [^0ac166be]. American Family Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Dysuria, a feeling of pain or discomfort during urination, is often caused by urinary tract infection but can also be due to sexually transmitted infection, bladder irritants, skin lesions, and some chronic pain conditions. History is most often useful for finding signs of sexually transmitted infection, complicated infections, lower urinary symptoms in males, and noninfectious causes. Most patients presenting with dysuria should have a urinalysis performed. Urine culture should be performed for infection to guide appropriate antibiotic use, especially for recurrent or suspected complicated urinary tract infection. Vaginal discharge decreases the likelihood of urinary tract infection, and other causes of dysuria, including cervicitis, should be investigated. If a patient has persistent urethritis or cervicitis with negative initial testing, Mycoplasma genitalium testing is recommended. Clinical decision rules may increase the accuracy of diagnosis with and without laboratory analysis. Evaluation and treatment of dysuria through a virtual encounter without laboratory testing may increase recurrent symptoms and antibiotic courses. Persistent symptoms after initial evaluation and treatment require further workup for infectious and noninfectious causes.

There are only a few reports of recurrent acute urinary retention caused by obstruction from congenital paraureteral diverticulum. We review the literature and present a case of a 14-month-old boy with bilateral hutch diverticuli who had his first episode of acute urinary retention in the neonatal period caused by left-sided diverticulum. We emphasised the fact that hutch diverticulum should be considered as one of the possible differential diagnoses in a child presenting with acute urinary retention.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnostic policy considerations: Harms/risks/costs state that stringent diagnostic criteria may miss a small number of UTIs, the benefit-harms assessment is a preponderance of benefit over harm, and value judgments note that treatment of asymptomatic bacteriuria may be harmful; the role of patient preferences is that parents prefer no action in the absence of a UTI (avoiding false-positive results) over a very small chance of missing a UTI, with exclusions noted as none, intentional vagueness as none, and policy level as recommendation.

Acute urinary retention is unusual in childhood and when present is likely to have an identifiable cause. Although the evaluation is often performed by the urologic specialist after relief of the obstruction, it is imperative that some causes be identified in the Emergency Department. This is a case of a 9-year-old boy in acute urinary retention caused by a ruptured appendix with a periappendiceal abscess.

Context

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequently occurring pediatric illness that, if left untreated, can lead to permanent renal injury. Accordingly, accurate diagnosis of UTI is important.

Objective

To review the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms and signs for the diagnosis of UTI in infants and children.

Data Sources

A search of MEDLINE and EMBASE databases was conducted for articles published between 1966 and October 2007, as well as a manual review of bibliographies of all articles meeting inclusion criteria, 1 previously published systematic review, 3 clinical skills textbooks, and 2 experts in the field, yielding 6988 potentially relevant articles.

Study Selection

Studies were included if they contained data on signs or symptoms of UTI in children through age 18 years. Of 337 articles examined, 12 met all inclusion criteria.

Data Extraction

Two evaluators independently reviewed, rated, and abstracted data from each article.

Data Synthesis

In infants with fever, history of a previous UTI (likelihood ratio [LR] range, 2.3–2.9), temperature higher than 40 degrees C (LR range, 3.2–3.3), and suprapubic tenderness (LR, 4.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.6–12.4) were the findings most useful for identifying those with a UTI. Among male infants, lack of circumcision increased the likelihood of a UTI (summary LR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.9–4.3); and the presence of circumcision was the only finding with an LR of less than 0.5 (summary LR, 0.33; 95% CI, 0.18–0.63). Combinations of findings were more useful than individual findings in identifying infants with a UTI (for temperature > 39 degrees C for > 48 hours without another potential source for fever on examination, the LR for all findings present was 4.0; 95% CI, 1.2–13.0; and for temperature < 39 degrees C with another source for fever, the LR was 0.37; 95% CI, 0.16–0.85). In verbal children, abdominal pain (LR, 6.3; 95% CI, 2.5–16.0), back pain (LR, 3.6; 95% CI, 2.1–6.1), dysuria, frequency, or both (LR range, 2.2–2.8), and new-onset urinary incontinence (LR, 4.6; 95% CI, 2.8–7.6) increased the likelihood of a UTI.

Conclusions

Although individual signs and symptoms were helpful in the diagnosis of a UTI, they were not sufficiently accurate to definitively diagnose UTIs. Combination of findings can identify infants with a low likelihood of a UTI.

### Acute urinary retention in children [^9690fc90]. The Journal of Urology (2001). Low credibility.

Purpose

Acute urinary retention is relatively infrequent in children. There are a variety of causes that are poorly defined in the literature, and they differ greatly from those seen most frequently in adults. We review our experience with pediatric patients presenting with urinary retention to 2 major metropolitan children's hospitals.

Materials and Methods

Records from Egleston and Scottish Rite Hospitals for Children were reviewed for a 6-year period for the diagnosis of urinary retention. Urinary retention was defined as inability to empty the bladder volitionally for greater than 12 hours with a volume of urine greater than expected for age ([age in years + 2] × 30 cc) or a palpably distended bladder. All cases resulting postoperatively and believed secondary to surgical dissection, narcotic use or immobility, and children previously diagnosed with chronic neurological disorders and voiding dysfunction or with reduced mental status were excluded from study. The majority of these encounters were emergency department visits specifically for acute urinary retention.

Results

We identified 53 children meeting these criteria, including 37 boys 6 months to 17 years old and 16 girls 1 to 17 years old. Etiologies included neurological processes in 17%, severe voiding dysfunction in 15%, urinary tract infection in 13%, constipation in 13%, adverse drug effect in 13%, local inflammatory causes in 7%, locally invading neoplasms in 6%, benign obstructing lesions in 6%, idiopathic in 6%, combined urinary tract infection and constipation in 2%, and incarcerated inguinal hernia in 2% of cases. Adverse drug effects and dysfunctional voiding were implicated 3 times as often in males than females (16% versus 6% and 19% versus 6%, respectively). Urinary tract infections were 6 times more common in females (31% versus 5%). Constipation and local inflammatory processes were twice as common in females than males (19% versus 11% and 12% versus 5%, respectively). Local neoplasms, benign obstruction and idiopathic causes were found exclusively in males.

Conclusions

Urinary retention in children is a relatively rare entity but there is a significant incidence of neurological abnormalities in this population. If a clear reason for this condition cannot be delineated based on history, physical examination and laboratory assessment, these patients should undergo prompt neurological evaluation and appropriate imaging studies.

### Dysuria: evaluation and differential diagnosis in adults [^acf2b09c]. American Family Physician (2015). Low credibility.

The most common cause of acute dysuria is infection, especially cystitis. Other infectious causes include urethritis, sexually transmitted infections, and vaginitis. Noninfectious inflammatory causes include a foreign body in the urinary tract and dermatologic conditions. Noninflammatory causes of dysuria include medication use, urethral anatomic abnormalities, local trauma, and interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. An initial targeted history includes features of a local cause (e.g., vaginal or urethral irritation), risk factors for a complicated urinary tract infection (e.g., male sex, pregnancy, presence of urologic obstruction, recent procedure), and symptoms of pyelonephritis. Women with dysuria who have no complicating features can be treated for cystitis without further diagnostic evaluation. Women with vulvovaginal symptoms should be evaluated for vaginitis. Any complicating features or recurrent symptoms warrant a history, physical examination, urinalysis, and urine culture. Findings from the secondary evaluation, selected laboratory tests, and directed imaging studies enable physicians to progress through a logical evaluation and determine the cause of dysuria or make an appropriate referral.

### Urinary tract infection in children: when to worry [^914d7df5]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a frequent diagnosis in children who are referred to the urologist. Although most infections will resolve without complication after appropriate treatment, a wide array of potential complicating factors exists, which can make difficult the rapid resolution of a UTI. Clinical scenarios involving these factors require a high index of suspicion and prompt initiation of appropriate therapy.

### Pediatric urinary retention in the emergency department: a Concerning symptom with etiology outside the bladder [^5fc81c9e]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Urinary retention in an otherwise healthy adolescent is a concerning symptom, in which etiology can range from an extracystic mass to central nervous system involvement (CNS). One possibility is acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), a rare inflammatory autoimmune disease that affects the CNS via demyelination. The disease usually is preceded by an acute viral infection, and commonly presents with multifocal neurological deficits. The diagnosis for ADEM is made based on clinical presentation, correlating with findings characterized on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the CNS.

Case Report

Our case involves a 16-year-old boy who presented to the Emergency Department (ED) with urinary retention. The patient was an otherwise healthy adolescent who was experiencing intermittent fevers for 1 week, and was found to be monospot positive when seen by his pediatrician. When presenting to the ED, the patient's primary complaint was urinary retention, which he experienced acutely in the middle of the night. Due to the suspicious nature of the patient's symptoms and history of present illness, the patient received a thorough workup including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the patient's brain and spinal cord, which demonstrated findings consistent with ADEM. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? There is very little literature describing a case of ADEM in the ED where the primary manifesting symptom was urinary retention. In addition, it is important that clinicians address acute urinary retention in an otherwise healthy adolescent as a red flag, with the need to rule out concerning etiology.

### Why we need a higher suspicion index of urolithiasis in children [^86fdf543]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Most children with symptoms of urolithiasis and urinary solute excretion abnormalities leading to stone formation have no calculi revealed by ultrasound or X-ray plain film ("occult urolithiasis"). This covers a large group of children presenting with common symptoms such as abdominal pain, hematuria, and dysuria, often faced by general practitioners and pediatricians. However, half or more of children with urolithiasis could present with abdominal/flank pain without specific urinary symptoms.

Study Design

We review the current evidence about prevalence, clinical presentation, and radiological detection of overt and "occult" urolithiasis in children, aiming to give readers the instruments to suspect and diagnose urolithiasis while avoiding cost-ineffective and undue diagnostic procedures.

Conclusions

It is important to investigate for urolithiasis first by ultrasound and, in specific cases, by urinary metabolic and different imaging studies in the following groups: 1) in children with non-glomerular hematuria or/and dysuria not presenting inflammation of external genitalia; 2) in children with acute/sub-acute or infrequent recurrent abdominal pain and family history of urolithiasis in first or second degree relatives or being at higher risk of developing stones although hematuria and dysuria are lacking; 3) in children under 8 years old, even though pain is central or diffuse to the whole abdomen; and 4) in children presenting risk factors or conditions predisposing to urolithiasis. Finally, it seems reasonable to repeat ultrasound 1–2 years later also in children with "occult" urolithiasis and high risk of developing stones to detect any (re-)appearance of calculi.

### A rare cause of acute urinary retention in a male infant [^e9790f04]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Acute urinary retention is an uncommon entity in childhood, and is associated with a variety of causes. Congenital bladder diverticulae are a rare cause of this condition, and occur almost exclusively in boys. True congenital diverticulae are most often solitary. Acute urinary retention is an extremely rare complication of congenital bladder diverticulae. Voiding cystourethrography is considered the most reliable method for detection. We report a case of a 3-month-old male infant who was presented with several episodes of acute urinary retention caused by bilateral congenital bladder diverticulae. Clinical and radiological evaluation and surgical correction are discussed.

### Acute urinary retention in a child caused by a congenital bladder diverticulum [^31ecebba]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

Acute urinary retention is an uncommon diagnosis in childhood, and is associated with a variety of causes. Congenital bladder diverticula, occurring almost exclusively in boys, is not a rare entity. However, acute urinary retention is an extremely rare complication of congenital bladder diverticulum. A boy with acute urinary retention caused by obstructing bladder diverticula is presented, and the surgical approach is discussed.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^ce643685]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Conclusions — In infants and young children 2 to 24 months of age with UTI and unexplained fever, diagnosis is based on the presence of pyuria and at least 50 000 CFUs per mL of a single uropathogen in an appropriately collected specimen of urine; urinalysis alone does not provide a definitive diagnosis. Strategies for diagnosis and treatment depend on whether the clinician determines that antimicrobial therapy is warranted immediately or can be delayed safely until urine culture and urinalysis results are available. After 7 to 14 days of antimicrobial treatment, close clinical follow-up monitoring should be maintained with evaluation of the urine during subsequent febrile episodes to permit prompt diagnosis and treatment of recurrent infections.

### Cobb's collar: a rare cause of urinary retention [^78151f49]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Cobb's collar is a membranous stricture of the bulbar urethra, often misdiagnosed, potentially leading to acute urinary retention, upper urinary tract dilations, enuresis, infectious diseases, poor streaming and haematuria. A 14-year-old boy with a history of previous hospitalisations came to our attention. A Cobb's collar was diagnosed and successfully managed with a videoendoscopic one-step approach. Although extremely uncommon, paediatric urologists must be aware of this congenital anomaly. A correct and timely diagnosis and endoscopic management may affect positively the clinical onset of these patients avoiding major urethral surgery and preserving renal and bladder function.

### Urinary tract infections in children: an overview of diagnosis and management [^9a9aff66]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Diagnosis

Clinical features of paediatric UTI are remarkably non-specific, especially in younger children. Diagnosis can be challenging but is important to consider, especially for infants with fever without focus.

History

Younger preverbal children cannot report symptoms such as dysuria or abdominal pain. Parents often notice non-specific signs, such as lethargy, irritability, poor feeding and vomiting. These overlap with many common and benign viral infections, as well as serious bacterial infections. Fever is often present, may be the only feature present or the child may be afebrile. Malodorous or discoloured urine may be obscured in nappy-wearing children. Older children may report localising symptoms such as dysuria or flank pain.

Examination

Children with UTI may appear very well or very unwell. Fever, abdominal tenderness and dehydration may be identified. Localising signs are more likely in older children. As clinical diagnosis is unreliable, a urine sample is required for further evaluation.

Urine sample collection: continent children

Continent children can void on request to provide a midstream urine (MSU) sample into a sterile collection jar. The first voided urine flushes skin flora away from the urethral orifice, before sample collection from the middle of the urinary stream. Cleaning with soap and water before MSU further reduces contamination.

### International children's continence society's recommendations for initial diagnostic evaluation and follow-up in congenital neuropathic bladder and bowel dysfunction in children [^203a8946]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2012). Low credibility.

Purpose

The objective of this ICCS standardization document is to report the initial diagnostic evaluation and subsequent work-up of children with neuropathic bladder dysfunction.

Materials and Methods

Due to a paucity of level I or level II, "levels of evidence" publications, these recommendations are actually a compilation of best practices because they seem to be effective and reliable, although not with any control.

Results

Throughout the document, the emphasis is on promoting early, comprehensive evaluation of lower urinary tract function that is thorough but with a minimum of unnecessary testing. This includes what tests to order, when to order them and what to do with the results. Some of the recommendations may not be practical in various worldwide locations but the suggested testing should be considered the ideal approach to completely diagnosing and then promulgating treatments based on the full knowledge of the condition and its effect on urinary tract function. Once the findings are delineated, those lower urinary tract patterns of dysfunction that put the kidneys at risk for deterioration, that are barriers to attaining eventual continence, and that have long-term consequence to the lower urinary track can be obviated by specific management recommendations. The indications and timing of investigations to achieve these objectives are clearly defined in each diagnostic category and during follow-up.

Recommendations

This document should be used as a basis for appropriate evaluation and timely surveillance of the various neuro-urologic conditions that affect children.

Clinical Presentation

Stercoral colitis has a varied presentation that typically includes complaints of chronic constipation and abdominal pain. Chronic constipation and severe impaction may further present with urinary symptoms that include difficulty urinating, urinary retention, and dysuria secondary to a stagnation induced urinary tract infection. On physical examination, patients may have abdominal distension and tenderness, a palpable fecal mass in the lower abdominal quadrants and a palpable, hardened fecal mass in the rectal vault on digital rectal exam.

### Urinary retention [^ed95e5fd]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Urinary retention is a common problem encountered in the emergency department. Acute urinary retention (AUR) presents as a sudden inability to voluntarily void, and is typically associated with lower abdominal pain. Its etiology can be varied and multifactorial. Treatment of AUR aims to relieve the obstruction and mitigate the underlying cause of retention. This can generally be accomplished in the emergency department without immediate urologic consultation; however, certain clinical features may require specialist involvement. This article provides an overview of the common causes of urinary retention, as well as emergency department evaluation, treatment, and disposition of patients with acute retention.

### Urinary tract infections in children: an overview of diagnosis and management [^51cb737f]. BMJ Paediatrics Open (2019). High credibility.

Upper versus lower tract UTI

UTI can be categorised anatomically into upper tract and lower tract infection. Upper tract UTI involves infection and inflammation in the kidneys (pyelonephritis) and ureters (figure 2). This typically leads to abdominal pain and loin tenderness, with systemic features such as fever, anorexia, vomiting, lethargy and malaise. Lower tract UTI involves infection within the bladder (cystitis) and urethra, with localised symptoms such as lower abdominal or suprapubic pain, dysuria, urinary frequency and urgency. Older children may present with signs and symptoms suggesting the site of infection. In younger patients, these classical signs are often absent, and differentiating between upper and lower UTI is less obvious.

### Burkitt's lymphoma of the prostate presenting as acute urinary retention: a case report [^ed70813b]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Burkitt's lymphoma is a specific non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma which first was described by Denis Burkitt in 1958. It makes up less than 1% of all non-Hodgkin lymphomas but is the most common non-Hodgkin lymphoma in childhood.

It can be divided into three subtypes: endemic, sporadic and immunodeficiency-associated. The endemic type is associated almost always with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and occurs frequently in African children. In western countries the sporadic form is more common. The immunodeficiency-associated type is seen in patients with HIV infection.

Sporadic Burkitt's lymphoma most commonly presents as abdominal lymphadenopathy with abdominal pain and other gastrointestinal symptoms. It less commonly affects the head and neck region and only seldom occurs extranodally. Non-Hodgkin's lymphomas affect the prostate in only 0.1% of cases. A couple of case reports exists of prostatic Burkitt's lymphoma in childhood. In adults only four cases have been described.

We report another case of prostatic Burkitt's lymphoma in a young male whose initial clinical sign was urinary retention. This case report and review of the literature are indented to reintroduce Burkitt's lymphoma and lymphomas as a whole to the list of differential diagnoses for acute urinary retention. Thereby it is supposed to sharpen diagnostic and clinical skills of urologists, oncologists and pathologists with special regard to treating young adult patients.

### Accidental ketosis-induced polyuria in a toddler: a case report [^09b28e4a]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Polyuria refers to the excessive production of urine, generally defined as > 2000 mL/m 2 /24h in the pediatric population. Polyuria is differentiated from urinary frequency, which is the increased need to urinate without excessive urine volume production. While urinary frequency is a relatively common phenomenon in children, often occurring in the setting of lower genito-urinary tract infections, the causes of polyuria in pediatric patients are less common and require prompt recognition and diagnosis. Polyuria frequently presents in the setting of underlying conditions that result in either a water diuresis or solute diuresis. The differential diagnosis for new-onset polyuria in the pediatric population includes diabetes mellitus, central diabetes insipidus, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, in addition to other less common metabolic, endocrine, renal, and psychological causes (Table 1).

Asymptomatic bacteriuria in infancy — An important cause of bacteriuria without pyuria is asymptomatic bacteriuria, which can occur in infants. In a study of infants 2 to 24 months of age, 0.7% of afebrile girls had 3 successive urine cultures with 105 CFUs per mL of a single uropathogen; this condition can be confused with true UTI but should be distinguished because studies suggest antimicrobial treatment may do more harm than good, and the key discriminator is the presence of pyuria.

### Diagnosis and management of hymenal variants: ACOG committee opinion, number 780 [^d65bae3a]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2019). High credibility.

ACOG Committee Opinion — diagnosis of imperforate hymen at puberty highlights typical presentation and evaluation steps. At puberty, an imperforate hymen typically presents with a vaginal bulge of thin hymenal tissue with a dark or bluish hue caused by hematocolpos, and other findings may include an abdominal mass, urinary retention, dysuria, constipation, and dyschezia. On evaluation, the goal is to differentiate an imperforate hymen from other obstructing anatomic etiologies such as labial adhesions, urogenital sinus, transverse vaginal septum, or distal vaginal atresia. It is important to complete an abdominal and a perineal examination. If the physical examination reveals a bulging hymen and ultrasonography reveals hematocolpos, further imaging is not required. However, if the diagnosis is not certain or there is concern for a distal vaginal atresia, cervical atresia, an obstructed uterine horn, or transverse or longitudinal vaginal septum, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended. Typically, an imperforate hymen is an isolated issue and does not have long-term effects on fertility, sexual function, or obstetric outcomes.

### Further investigation of confirmed urinary tract infection (UTI) in children under five years: a systematic review [^1bfe20d0]. BMC Pediatrics (2005). Low credibility.

Methods

We assembled a database of published and unpublished literature from systematic searches of 16 electronic databases (inception to between October 2002 and February 2003), hand searching of 12 journals, consultation with experts in the field, and screening bibliographies of included studies. Update searches were conducted in May 2004. There were no language restrictions. Full details of the search strategy will be reported elsewhere.

We included controlled trials that compared different imaging strategies and reported patient based outcomes. We also included diagnostic cohort studies that included at least 20 children, some of whom were aged five years or under, and that reported sufficient information to construct 2 × 2 tables. Table 1 presents a summary of the tests evaluated in this review and details the potential advantages that these tests have over the current reference standards. Although other tests have been evaluated, this article will focus on those offering potential advantages over the current reference standard. Studies had to compare one of the index tests listed in this table to the listed reference standard, for each of the different aims.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^2aa98caf]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Pediatric urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnosis — urine culture thresholds and organism relevance: In infants and children, an appropriate threshold to consider bacteriuria significant is at least 50 000 CFUs per mL of a single urinary pathogen, and reducing the threshold from 100 000 CFUs per mL to 50 000 CFUs per mL may increase sensitivity but decrease specificity; laboratories that report categorical results (0 to 1000, 1000 to 10 000, 10 000 to 100 000, and more than 100 000 CFUs per mL) require contextual interpretation for results in the 10 000 to 100 000 CFUs per mL range, and organisms such as Lactobacillus spp, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and Corynebacterium spp are not considered clinically relevant urine isolates for otherwise healthy, 2- to 24-month-old children; infants with positive culture alone are recognized as having asymptomatic bacteriuria rather than a true UTI when pyuria is absent.

Imperforate hymen — neonatal and pubertal presentations and initial management are described as follows: the imperforate hymen may present in the neonatal period as a hydrocolpos or mucocolpos with a bulging, translucent, or yellow mass at the introitus, and surgical intervention is necessary only in symptomatic prepubertal patients with intervention usually deferred until pubertal estrogenization has occurred because the imperforate hymen may open spontaneously at puberty. At puberty, typical findings include a vaginal bulge of thin hymenal tissue with a dark or bluish hue caused by hematocolpos that distends further with the Valsalva maneuver; pain may be pelvic or abdominal, cyclic or acute, and other findings may include an abdominal mass, urinary retention, dysuria, constipation, and dyschezia.

### Can we improve our routine urological assessment to exclude neurogenic causes for lower urinary tract dysfunction? ICI-RS 2024 [^1ce789b1]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

Another risk area is failure to recognize the implication of an aspect of past medical history, specifically that healthcare professionals may not appreciate that a condition can be associated with neurogenic LUTD. This includes conditions that have improved substantially from a severe initial problem (e.g. transverse myelitis) or have remained static. Examples include children with so‐called "special needs" and intellectually and/or motor disabled people (notably Cerebral Palsy (CP), Down Syndrome, Rett Syndrome, Angelman Syndrome, Fragile‐X Syndrome, Williams Beuren Syndrome, X‐linked adrenoleukodystrophy), and those with rare diseases (e.g. Guillain–Barré Syndrome, Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis, Meningitis‐Retention Syndrome). In CP, LUTS are present in about a third of children, in proportion to the severity of motor and/or cognitive disabilities. Many adult CP patients also present in the second or third decade of life with LUTD, particularly with urinary retention. LUTS can start in the pediatric age range, but may be missed if parents and physicians are mainly focused on physical rehabilitation, or management of respiratory or nutritional concerns. Urinary incontinence might even be considered "normal" in some conditions, and hence not be evaluated. This means upper urinary tract evaluation may not be done, resulting in young adults presenting with avoidable renal impairment at first urological assessment.

Overall, missed pediatric NLUTD, or progression of a pediatric condition, is an important consideration in adolescents and young adults. NLUTD must be excluded in the presence of; recurrent or persistent incontinence, complicated incontinence (with pain and/or haematuria), recurrent UTIs, relapse of vesicoureteral reflux or presence of renal scarring, and LUTD with upper urinary tract impairment not responding to treatment.

Neither eosinophilic cystitis nor nephrogenic adenoma is often diagnosed in children, with few pediatric cases being reported in the literature. Although these maladies share the same predisposing conditions, namely, chronic irritation or injury to the urothelium and lower urinary tract and symptoms such as dysuria, hematuria, and urinary frequency, their concomitance is exceptional. Herein, we report the case of an 8-year-old boy with a previous history of bladder surgery presenting histologically diagnosed eosinophilic cystitis and nephrogenic adenoma.

### Pediatric urinary tract infection [^828167f7]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

UTIs are common in children. They may present with a range of severity from cystitis to febrile UTI or pyelonephritis. The presentation may be vague and have nonspecific symptoms. Therefore, a UTI should be considered in all children with a fever in whom other sources have been excluded. Treatment depends on the age, location of infection, and degree of illness in the child. Sick children and infants less than 3 months should be treated as inpatients, and healthy children and older infants may be treated as outpatients. Urinalysis provides presumptive evidence of infection, whereas urine culture is definitive. Close follow-up and outpatient evaluations are needed to prevent long-term consequences of infection.

### Acute urinary retention caused by an ovarian teratoma – A unique pediatric presentation and review [^3f7a68e7]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Acute urinary retention (AUR) is a rare diagnosis both in pediatric and adult female populations, especially when compared to adult males. AUR occurs in women at a rate of 7 in 100,000 per year in a 1:13 female to male ratio. Multiple studies have shown that within the pediatric population AUR is far less common in females and is caused by different pathologies than AUR in adult women.

Case Report

We report the case of an 11 year-old prepubescent female who presented to the emergency department with acute urinary retention found to be caused by a mature cystic ovarian teratoma. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Our case is unique in that it describes an ovarian mass leading to AUR which has not previously been described in the pediatric literature. We will review the causes of AUR in the pediatric female population and compare these to the causes of AUR in other populations.

Urinalysis general considerations — Urinalysis cannot substitute for urine culture to document the presence of UTI but needs to be used in conjunction with culture; because urine culture results are not available for at least 24 hours, there is considerable interest in tests that may predict the culture result and enable presumptive therapy, and urinalysis can be performed on any specimen, including one collected from a bag applied to the perineum, but the specimen must be fresh (< 1 hour after voiding with maintenance at room temperature or < 4 hours after voiding with refrigeration) to ensure sensitivity and specificity.

Urine dipstick tests (nitrite and leukocyte esterase) — Dipstick assays detect leukocyte esterase (LE) and urinary nitrite, and bacterial conversion of dietary nitrates to nitrites requires approximately 4 hours in the bladder; because infants void frequently, a nitrite test is not sensitive and negative results have little value in ruling out urinary tract infection (UTI), although a positive nitrite is highly specific. In clinically suspected UTI, LE sensitivity is 94%, with overall reported sensitivity 83% and specificity average 72% (range: 64%–92%); positive LE results should be interpreted with caution because false-positive results are common and pyuria is nonspecific.

### Fibroepithelial polyp of the prostatic urethra in an adolescent [^6054e446]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Benign fibroepithelial polyp of the prostatic urethra is a rare congenital lesion most commonly diagnosed in the pediatric population because of diverse urinary symptoms. We report a case of a 16-year-old adolescent boy who presented with urinary retention. Imaging and endoscopic studies confirmed the presence of a polypoid lesion at the bladder base/posterior prostatic urethra. Following transurethral resection of this polypoid mass, the diagnosis of a congenital fibroepithelial polyp of the prostatic urethra was rendered by pathologic evaluation. Although this is considered a benign lesion with no previous reports of recurrence or malignant behavior, it produces dramatic urinary symptoms in the pediatric population with a wide differential diagnosis. Imaging and endoscopic findings may suggest a malignancy and are not sufficient to render a precise diagnosis, which can only be made by pathologic examination.

Patients with this syndrome generally present after menarche with pelvic pain and mass and, rarely, primary infertility in later years. Strong suspicion and knowledge of this syndrome are mandatory for an accurate diagnosis. A 14-year-old female patient presented with acute retention of urine and abdominopelvic pain. Her condition was diagnosed with the use ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging as a case of HWW syndrome. She was treated with vaginal hemiseptal resection. The HWW syndrome should be considered among the differential diagnoses in girls with renal anomalies presenting with pelvic mass, symptoms of acute abdominal pain, and acute urinary retention.

An 11-year-old girl presented with poor urinary stream with vaginal voiding since childhood. She had palpable bladder and raised serum creatinine (671µmol/L). Suprapubic catheterisation was performed after a failed urethral attempt. Following catheterisation she improved symptomatically. She underwent cystoscopy through the suprapubic portal as a guide wire could be negotiated through bladder neck; external urethral meatus was found as a dimple higher up in anterior vaginal wall. Female hypospadias is usually an incidental diagnosis during catheterisation for various reasons. Diagnosis could be established only after antegrade cystoscopy. Anecdotal cases have been reported in the literature with similar presentation. Early diagnosis is essential as renal failure could be a late presentation if patients continue to void with stenosed meatus. Long-term follow-up is needed as these patients may need definitive management later on.

### Neuroblastoma causing acute urinary retention: a rare presentation [^f5302c85]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor in children under the age of 5 years and, after acute lymphoblastic leukemia, is the second most prevalent malignancy in childhood. Acute urinary retention is rare in children, especially due to a neuroblastoma.

Objectives

To present the potential complications of a pelvic neuroblastoma.

Case Report

A 9-month-old infant presented with urinary retention that had been attributed in the past to the infant's chronic constipation. She was catheterized and a large residual of urine was obtained; she was discharged home. She returned the following day with the same complaint. Plain radiographs suggested a soft tissue density in the pelvic region with no evidence of constipation. Rectal examination revealed a mass, and a computed tomography scan showed a large, solid mass. Pathological examination confirmed a pelvic neuroblastoma, which was resected.

Conclusions

The most common causes of acute urinary retention are urinary tract infections, lower urinary stones, neurologic processes, trauma, and constipation. A detailed and focused history and physical examination can be very helpful in diagnosing a pathological cause of urinary retention, such as a pelvic neuroblastoma.

### Urinary retention in children [^16fff6e1]. Urology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the causes and outcome of urinary retention in children and assess its prevalence by gender and age.

Methods

The medical records of all children (aged < 18 years) who presented to the emergency room with acute urinary retention from 2000 to 2012 were reviewed. Patients with postoperative urinary retention, a known neurologic disorder, and neonates were excluded. Data were collected on patient demographics and cause, treatment, and outcome of the urinary retention. Findings were evaluated and compared by age and gender.

Results

The study group comprised 42 boys (75%) and 14 girls (25%). Median follow-up time was 25 months. Causes of urinary retention were mechanical obstruction in 14 patients (25%), infection or inflammation in 10 (18%), fecal impaction in 7 (13%), neurologic disorders in 6 (11%), gynecologic disorders in 4 (7%), and behavioral processes in 3 patients (5%); 12 patients (21%) were idiopathic. All patients with mechanical obstruction were boys, of whom 5 had a pelvic tumor. Age distribution was bimodal: 29% of the events occurred between ages 3 and 5 years, and 32%, between ages 10 and 13 years. Fifteen children underwent surgery. Three children required continuous catheterization during follow-up.

Conclusion

Urinary retention in children is characterized by a variable etiology and bimodal age distribution. The high rate of severe underlying disease is noteworthy and should alert physicians to the importance of a prompt, comprehensive, primary evaluation of this patient population in a hospital setting to initiate appropriate treatment and avoid complications.

### Fifteen-minute consultation: why and how do children get urinary tract infections? [^f3590dd3]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2019). Medium credibility.

This paper describes urinary tract infections (UTI) from the perspective of a disturbed balance between bacterial virulence and host defence. In some children, a UTI is caused by a virulent Escherichia coli, while in other cases children with abnormal renal tracts can get infected by almost any bacteria. Such knowledge can help in guiding treatment, investigations and follow-up of a child with a UTI.

### Urinary tract infection: clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of the initial UTI in febrile infants and children 2 to 24 months [^8f689214]. Pediatrics (2011). Medium credibility.

Action statement 7 — After confirmation of urinary tract infection (UTI), the clinician should instruct parents or guardians to seek prompt medical evaluation (ideally within 48 hours) for future febrile illnesses, to ensure that recurrent infections can be detected and treated promptly (evidence quality: C; recommendation). Early treatment limits renal damage better than late treatment, and the risk of renal scarring increases as the number of recurrences increases; all infants who have sustained a febrile UTI should have a urine specimen obtained at the onset of subsequent febrile illnesses, so that a UTI can be diagnosed and treated promptly. After 7 to 14 days of antimicrobial treatment, close clinical follow-up monitoring should be maintained with evaluation of the urine during subsequent febrile episodes, and ultrasonography of the kidneys and bladder should be performed to detect anatomic abnormalities that require further evaluation. Routine VCUG after the first UTI is not recommended; VCUG is indicated if RBUS reveals hydronephrosis, scarring, or other findings that would suggest either high-grade VUR or obstructive uropathy, as well as in other atypical or complex clinical circumstances, and VCUG also should be performed if there is a recurrence of febrile UTI.

### Dysfunctional elimination syndrome in children without obvious spinal cord diseases [^0d40318d]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Elimination dysfunction is a functional disease that encompasses the urinary and GI tracts. Because the presentation is varied and ED is a disease of exclusion, a thorough history and physical examination are mandatory. Noninvasive management that includes the "fundamental four" and continuous engagement and encouragement of the patient and family are the pillars of treatment. For patients who are refractory to this approach, new research in children-directed biofeedback research shows promise.

### Accidental ketosis-induced polyuria in a toddler: a case report [^d37b118d]. BMC Pediatrics (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

In the pediatric population, parental concern of recent onset frequent or large volume urination in young children is common.

Case presentation

A 2-year-old male with no significant past medical history and unremarkable family history was brought to his pediatrician by his mother who reports that the child had been "soaking through his diapers" for the previous two to 3 days. Mother states that patient has not had an appreciable change in the number of wet diapers per day, just the perceived weight/volume of each diaper. The patient's mother denied any recent illness, apparent abdominal pain, dysuria, or recent changes in his bowel movements. She similarly denied polydipsia, polyphagia, or gross hematuria in the patient. Patient's diet consists of eating a low carbohydrate with mostly high protein and fat diet that was similar to the paleo-type diet consumed by her and her husband. Meals over the recent days were even lower in carbohydrates than usual as the family was actively trying to consume healthier food options.

On physical exam the child was found to be afebrile with a normal physical exam. A urine dipstick was performed and was positive for 2+ ketones and 1+ protein. Urine leukocytes and nitrites were negative, as was urinary glucose. A fingerstick blood glucose sample was 83 mg/dL.

Based on the patient's physical examination, laboratory findings, and the history which revealed a very-low carbohydrate diet, a preliminary diagnosis of ketosis-induced polyuria was made. The patient's mother was advised to incorporate a greater portion of carbohydrates into her son's diet, with a follow-up scheduled for the following week. At the follow-up appointment the mother reports that she had continued the patient's carbohydrate intake and the excessive urine amount per wet diaper has not returned. Repeat urine dipstick confirmed the resolution of the ketonuria and proteinuria.

Conclusion

This case illustrates the inadvertent consequences that can occur when parents impose new fad diets on their young children. The recent increase in the popularity of fad diets makes the consideration of alternative diets important to review in the patient history and subsequently include in the differential diagnosis of polyuria.

### OHVIRA syndrome (obstructed hemivagina and ipsilateral renal anomaly) with uterus didelphys, an unusual presentation [^b1364bb2]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Obstructed hemivagina and ipsilateral renal anomaly (OHVIRA), or Herlyn-Werner-Wunderlich syndrome, is a rare Mullerian duct anomaly with uterus didelphys, unilateral obstructed hemivagina, and ipsilateral renal agenesis. Patients with this anomaly usually present after menarche with pelvic pain and/or a mass and rarely, in later years, with primary infertility. Strong suspicion and knowledge of this anomaly are essential for a precise diagnosis.

Case

A 14-year-old female presented with acute retention of urine and was diagnosed as a case of OHVIRA syndrome with uterus didelphys. Acute retention of urine as the initial clinical presentation has been rarely reported in this syndrome. She was treated with hemivaginal septal resection.

Summary and Conclusion

OHVIRA syndrome should be considered among the differential diagnoses in young females with renal anomalies presenting with pelvic mass, symptoms of acute abdomen, and acute urinary retention.

### Pediatric stercoral colitis and acute kidney injury from chronic constipation [^9c6f303b]. Clinical Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Differential Diagnoses

Our patient first presented with hyponatremia, acute kidney injury (AKI), iron deficiency anemia, and hypoalbuminemia. A urine analysis from admission revealed a urinary tract infection with E. coli and E. feacalis likely due to a large rectal stool burden that obstructed the bladder and the kidneys bilaterally as demonstrated by CT imaging. Collectively, findings from admission along with the patient's history of chronic constipation quickly delineated diagnoses to a likely gastrointestinal etiology. Stagnation of fecal matter was likely at play and attempts at bowel cleanout were thereby quickly initiated. Differential diagnoses of chronic constipation leading to the buildup of large, stagnant, and hardened fecal mass, or a fecaloma, include functional causes like fecal retention, lack of fiber bulk in diet, and psychiatric conditions like depression or an eating disorder. Mechanical obstruction, as a broad category, is also on the differential and may be due to late presenting Hirschsprung disease, the presence of a pelvic mass, rectal stenosis, or postoperative stricture formation. Chronic constipation may be caused by pain on defection which may arise due to the presence of an anal fissure or foreign body, sexual abuse or perianal streptococcal infection.

### Acute urinary retention in children [^f76c195f]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute urinary retention is a common emergency in adult patients, foremost in older men. In childhood urinary retention is a rare entity with only sparse literature on the etiology.

Objective

To assess the etiology and treatment of acute urinary retention in the pediatric population and assess age and sex distribution.

Study Design

A retrospective analysis of all patients admitted to our emergency department with acute urinary retention between 2005 and 2019 was performed. Exclusion criteria were newborns (because of physiologic postnatal oliguria) and postoperative urinary retention during the same hospital stay.

Results

113 children with acute urinary retention (ICD: R33) meeting the above criteria were identified. 16 Patients were excluded because of incomplete medical charts. 97 children were included into the study (age 0.5–18.3 years, mean age 5.3 years). 89 patients had one episode, 8 patients two episodes. A peak around the third year of age was observed. Sex ratio showed a 2:1 male to female distribution. Most common etiology was balanoposthitis (15.5%) and acute constipation/fecal impaction (15.5%). Traumatic urinary retention was found in 11.4% of the cases. Urinary tract infection were found 7.2%. No underlying reason could be found in 12.4% (idiopathic urinary retention). Other causes included febrile non-urinary infection (8.2%), subvesical obstruction (4.1%), vulvovaginitis (3.1%) and urethritis (2.1%). In 50% of the cases of urinary retention under 1 year of age (2 out of 4) an underlying tumor (rhabdomyosarcoma, sacral teratoma) was identified.

Discussion

Age and sex distribution were similar to previously published series; however, this study shows a marked difference concerning the etiology: e.g. we identified a significantly higher proportion of functional disorders as a reason for acute urinary retention in childhood. It is hypothesized that this is partly because previously published studies originate from areas (USA, Israel, Iran) with different socio-demographic and cultural background.

Conclusion

AUR in children is a rare condition with very heterogeneous causes. Although the majority of cases exhibit mild underlying conditions, serious reasons, such as malignant diseases especially in the first year of life, must be excluded. AUR relief without catheterization is a child-friendly approach in cases of mild inflammatory or functional disorders and can help to minimize traumatization.

### Pediatric genitourinary infections and other considerations [^65253387]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2019). Medium credibility.

Pediatric patients pose a unique host of challenges to the emergency provider across all complaints and ages, but this is particularly notable in the genitourinary (GU) system. The pediatric GU system is different from that of the adult in its etiology of symptoms, complications, and treatments. Based on age, there are variations in the anatomy. These differences result in symptoms and diagnoses that must be managed differently. Although in many respects management is similar to GU emergency conditions in adults, there are, occasionally subtle, differences between the care of children and adults, which can greatly impact outcomes.

### Guideline 1: identify potential… [^2c7e96c7]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Various terms have been used to describe this problem, including functional encopresis, primary nonretentive encopresis and stool toileting refusal. These children may be further divided into at least four subgroups: those who fail to obtain initial bowel training, those who exhibit toilet "phobia, " those who use soiling to "manipulate" their environment and those who have irritable bowel syndrome. While the treatment of retentive encopresis has progressed substantially in the past 20 years, less attention has been paid to the 5 to 20 percent of cases in which constipation is not contributory, or where a child "refuses" the toilet-training process. The family physician is likely to be the first to identify this problem and to provide "front line" intervention. In either case, without active intervention, the "strong-willed" child may resist toilet training, create unnecessary stress on the parent-child relationship and increase the risk of abuse.

12 This article provides treatment guidelines for children with primary nonretentive encopresis or stool toileting refusal. The guidelines were developed from the literature on toilet training and encopresis, with a special emphasis on practicality and ease of implementation by the family physician. The illustrative case presented on page 2176 shows the efficacy and simplicity of these treatment guidelines. BEHAVIORAL The most important areas of behavioral assessment of toileting include ruling out the presence of disruptive behavior problems such as aggression, oppositional behavior, noncompliance and temper tantrums, establishing the child's compliance with adult instructions and obtaining a daily diary of toileting habits. Coexisting behavior problems are a predictor of poor outcome in toilet-training protocols. The following illustrative case demonstrates the efficacy of these treatment guidelines in a child with nonretentive encopresis and toileting refusal.

Within one-half hour of being diapered, he would usually walk behind the living room couch to defecate into the diaper. Immediately after defecation, he would return to his foster mother, who would remove the diaper, clean him and put him back into ordinary underpants. The child would defecate only while at home in the living room and only when diapered. In the event of a family outing, arrangements were made to return home to provide him the opportunity to defecate. On occasions when he was refused a diaper, he repeatedly requested a diaper and withheld defecation for up to three days.

### Exploring dysfunctional voiding in girls: a comprehensive literature review of assessment and management strategies [^b8c0fbe3]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Other considerations

There is a well-established connection between bladder and bowel dysfunction that should be considered when assessing and managing DV. Stool retention, with or without fecal incontinence, often coexists with DV due to pelvic floor muscle non-relaxation. Treatment of constipation in children with LUTD has been shown to improve voiding symptoms. This aspect is critical in the holistic management of children with DV and should be emphasized in treatment plans.

Lastly, all patients showing any signs of underlying bladder dysfunction [e.g. diurnal incontinence, repeated staccato uroflow patterns, post-void residual [PVR] on ultrasound exceeding 10% of expected bladder volume for age, small bladder capacity for age, recurrent UTIs, and absence of neurological signs] should undergo a urodynamic study [UDS] to confirm the diagnosis of DV.

### Imperforate hymen causing hematocolpos and urinary retention [^45dc8916]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute urinary retention is rare in the pediatric population and is typically caused by an obstructing entity. It may result from hematocolpos caused by imperforate hymen. Imperforate hymen is rare, with an associated incidence of 1 in 2000 people. Nonetheless, in a pediatric age female who presents with urinary retention and who has a history of primary amenorrhea or a history of cyclical pelvic pain an examination of the external genitalia should be performed to rule out this condition.

Case Report

A 12-year-old girl presented to the emergency department with urinary retention and was discharged with a diagnosis of urinary tract infection. She returned the following day to the emergency department with worsening abdominal pain. A computed tomography scan revealed a fluid-filled vagina measuring 12.5 cm. Her bladder measured 15.4 cm. The patient was taken to the operating room for further evaluation by the consulting gynecologist. At the time of surgery, 1000 mL of urine were evacuated after catheterization. Three hundred milliliters of chocolate-colored fluid, consistent with menstrual blood, were evacuated at time of hymenotomy. Hymenotomy was performed with a cruciate incision. No complications were encountered. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? To date, there have been > 40 reported cases of imperforate hymen causing hematocolpos and subsequent urinary retention. However, given the rarity of imperforate hymen, hematocolpos leading to acute urinary retention can still be missed. Untreated urinary retention can lead to a compromise in bladder function and subsequent kidney damage.

### Providing a primary care medical home for children and youth with cerebral palsy [^914b4a7e]. Pediatrics (2022). High credibility.

Voiding dysfunction in cerebral palsy (CP) — screening and management in primary care are outlined as follows: Voiding dysfunction occurs across Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels but is more common at higher levels, and upper urinary tract issues may be signaled by urinary retention, detrusor-sphincter dyssynergy symptoms, and febrile urinary tract infections. Conservative interventions (adequate fluid intake, timed voiding, avoiding caffeine, addressing constipation) are effective for many, and referral to urology for urodynamic evaluation can be considered for persistent symptoms or concerns about upper tract abnormalities. Some patients with urgency or leakage attributable to detrusor overactivity may benefit from anticholinergic therapy, which requires caution because of potential urinary retention and worsening constipation, and clean intermittent catheterization may be indicated for urinary retention or detrusor-sphincter dyssynergy.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is frequent in the first year of life with bowel and bladder dysfunction, GU tract abnormalities, neurogenic bladder, and the intact prepuce conveying an increased risk. Urine culture is the gold standard for diagnosis. Antibiotics are tailored to resistance patterns. Guidelines have been established to direct the evaluation for GU anomalies but differ significantly. Bladder and bowel dysfunction is important to screen for and treat in potty-trained patients. Circumcised boys with febrile UTIs are more likely to have anatomic abnormalities than uncircumcised boys.

### Urinary tract infection at the age extremes: pediatrics and geriatrics [^33930ff9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2002). Low credibility.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common and generally benign conditions among healthy, sexually active young women without long-term medical sequelae. In contrast, UTIs are more complicated among those individuals at either end of the age spectrum: infants/young children and geriatrics. UTI in children younger than 2 years has been associated with significant morbidity and long-term medical consequences, necessitating an extensive and somewhat invasive imaging evaluation to identify possible underlying functional or anatomic abnormalities. Pediatric UTI should be considered complicated until proved otherwise, and treatment should reflect the severity of signs and symptoms. Management in the acutely ill child frequently involves parenteral broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents, and less ill children can be treated with trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), beta-lactams, and cephalosporins.UTI among older patients (> 65 years) may be complicated by comorbidities, the baseline presence of asymptomatic bacteriuria, and benign urinary symptoms that can complicate diagnosis. The etiology of UTI encompasses a broader spectrum of infecting organisms than is seen among younger patients and includes more gram-positive organisms. Symptomatic UTI is generally more difficult to treat than among younger populations. Management should be conservative, of longer treatment durations, and cover a broad spectrum of possible uropathogens. Oral or parenteral treatment with a fluoroquinolone for 7 days is the preferred empiric approach. TMP-SMX can also be considered a first-line agent in women only, but only if the pathogen is known to be TMP-SMX sensitive.

The history of muscle weakness, failure to thrive, polydipsia, and polyuria prompted subsequent clinical and laboratory evaluations, leading to the correct diagnosis of cystinosis. Primary and persistent constipation as an initial manifestation of cystinosis has not been reported previously. Although rare, cystinosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of constipation if other suggestive signs or symptoms are present.

### Incidence of pediatric urinary tract infections before and during the COVID-19 pandemic [^88051ef6]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Did the incidence of pediatric urinary tract infection (UTI) diagnoses and outcomes change during the COVID-19 pandemic?

Findings

In this cohort study of 13 million children with private insurance, the incidence of UTI was 1.30 cases per 100 patient-years, with notable variation by age, sex, and circumcision status. Compared with prepandemic trends, UTI diagnoses decreased by 33% during the early pandemic without associated changes in disease severity.

Meaning

This investigation provides updated data on UTI incidence in children; while the mechanism for decreased UTI incidence during the pandemic is unknown, a decrease in misdiagnosis and overdiagnosis may play a role.
