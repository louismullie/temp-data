## Question

Diphenhydramine pediatric dose

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diphenhydramine pediatric dosing across routes and indications, with attention to safety, overdose thresholds, and evidence quality. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the core pediatric dosing frameworks by route and indication. Then, I should verify age-related restrictions and maximum daily doses. Next, I will review safety signals and overdose thresholds that change practice. After that, I need to check the strength and consistency of the evidence base. Finally, I will synthesize practical, route-specific dosing recommendations and highlight key caveats and monitoring needs, making sure I cite the best available sources throughout.

> Let me first confirm the overarching pediatric dosing principle. For parenteral use when oral therapy is impractical, the FDA-labeled pediatric dose is 5 mg/kg/24 hours or 150 mg/m²/24 hours, divided every 6 hours, with a maximum daily dose of 300 mg, and IV administration not exceeding 25 mg/min. This applies to children other than premature infants and neonates, and I should double-check that the same ceiling and infusion rate appear across multiple FDA sources, which they do [^a2d736db] [^754dfdd7] [^9982030f].

> Wait, let me verify the oral dosing framework because it differs from parenteral. For oral antihistamine use, the most consistently cited pediatric dose is 1 mg/kg per dose, typically repeated every 4 to 6 hours, with a common maximum single dose of 25 mg and a daily maximum of 300 mg. I should confirm that this 1 mg/kg figure aligns with authoritative guidance, and yes, it is supported by pediatric allergy and emergency care guidance as well as consensus statements for allergic reactions and CVS management, though some sources cap at 50 mg per dose in older children, so I need to keep that nuance in mind [^59cf0281] [^25610953] [^ffe57050].

> Hold on, I should verify age-related restrictions because they materially change use. For oral diphenhydramine, many OTC products advise do not use in children under 2 years, and some under 6 years unless directed by a clinician. For parenteral use, the FDA explicitly contraindicates use in neonates and premature infants, so I need to ensure I do not overgeneralize adult or older-child dosing downward to these groups [^28951c1e] [^49a3604e] [^8d93fdd1].

> Next, I should review indication-specific dosing where the route and context shift the target. For motion sickness, the CDC Yellow Book supports 0.5–1 mg/kg per dose up to 25 mg given 1–2 hours before travel, with caution about oversedation in young children. For premedication to prevent infusion reactions, pediatric protocols commonly use 1 mg/kg up to 50 mg given within an hour pre-infusion. For dystonia or extrapyramidal symptoms, emergency guidance supports 1–1.25 mg/kg IV/IM with a maximum of 25 mg per dose. And for CVS abortive sedation, NASPGHAN recommends 1.25 mg/kg/dose PO/IV every 6 hours, with adolescent fixed doses of 25–50 mg, so I should preserve these context-specific ranges [^06a03709] [^b7de69a8] [^f7eed912] [^25610953] [^ffe57050].

> I need to check overdose thresholds and toxicity signals because they inform safe upper bounds and when to seek care. Multiple sources converge on 7.5 mg/kg as a practical threshold above which evaluation is recommended, with observational data showing that doses below 7.5 mg/kg rarely lead to serious effects, and dose–response modeling suggesting increased risk of clinically significant reactions at or above roughly 7.5–8.2 mg/kg. I should confirm that these thresholds are supported by validation studies and poison center guidance, which they are, including AAPCC-aligned recommendations and a large case series showing 99.6% of children ingesting less than 7.5 mg/kg did not require critical treatment or have serious effects [^8a232918] [^ee2ae5c6] [^440a6610].

> But wait, what if the child is very young or the exposure is unintentional. I should double-check that toddlers can manifest anticholinergic toxicity and sodium channel blockade even at moderate exposures, and case reports document wide-complex tachycardia responsive to sodium bicarbonate in pediatric overdose, reinforcing the need for ECG monitoring when toxicity is suspected. This means that while 7.5 mg/kg is a useful triage threshold, clinical presentation and ECG findings should guide escalation, not dose alone [^14669648] [^393945c5].

> Let me consider the evidence quality so I do not overstate certainty. The parenteral 5 mg/kg/day framework is FDA-labeled and high-credibility. The oral 1 mg/kg/dose framework is supported by multiple pediatric guidelines and consensus statements, though many pediatric antihistamine indications have limited high-quality RCT data, which is a recognized gap in the literature. Overdose thresholds are supported by observational case series and modeling, which are lower on the evidence pyramid but consistent across studies, so I should flag them as strong practice patterns rather than definitive causality [^a2d736db] [^59cf0281] [^25610953] [^8e9a4eef] [^ee2ae5c6] [^440a6610].

> I should confirm practical administration details and safety caveats. For IV use, keep infusion rates at or below 25 mg/min to mitigate hypotension and QRS widening risks. Monitor for anticholinergic effects, excitation in young children, and additive CNS depression with other sedatives. Avoid use in neonates and premature infants. And counsel caregivers on storage and overdose risk, especially given the frequency of unintentional ingestions and the potential for serious toxicity at high doses [^a2d736db] [^49a3604e] [^7bede623] [^bab44287].

> Let me synthesize route-specific dosing succinctly, and I will double-check the caps as I go. Oral dosing: 1 mg/kg per dose every 4–6 hours, typically not exceeding 25 mg per dose in younger children, with a daily maximum of 300 mg; adolescents may receive 25–50 mg per dose in some protocols. Parenteral dosing: 5 mg/kg/24 hours or 150 mg/m²/24 hours divided every 6 hours, maximum 300 mg/day, IV rate ≤ 25 mg/min. Motion sickness: 0.5–1 mg/kg per dose up to 25 mg, 1–2 hours pre-travel. Infusion premedication: 1 mg/kg up to 50 mg within 1 hour pre-infusion. Dystonia: 1–1.25 mg/kg IV/IM, max 25 mg per dose. CVS sedation: 1.25 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours, adolescents 25–50 mg [^59cf0281] [^25610953] [^a2d736db] [^06a03709] [^b7de69a8] [^f7eed912] [^ffe57050].

> Hold on, I should verify the key safety takeaway so it is actionable. Doses below 7.5 mg/kg are generally associated with low risk of serious toxicity, but clinical judgment and ECG assessment remain essential when symptoms are present or the history is uncertain. If there is suspicion of overdose or significant anticholinergic or cardiotoxic effects, manage supportively and consider sodium bicarbonate for QRS widening, with early involvement of poison control and appropriate monitoring [^ee2ae5c6] [^14669648] [^8a232918].

### Diphenhydramine and dimenhydrinate poisoning: an evidence-based consensus guideline for out-of-hospital management [^8a232918]. Clinical Toxicology (2006). Low credibility.

In 2003, there were 28,092 human exposures to diphenhydramine reported to poison centers in the US. A related drug, dimenhydrinate, is a less frequent cause of poisonings. Between January 2000 and June 2004, there were 2,534 reported dimenhydrinate ingestions in children less than 6 years of age. An evidence-based expert consensus process was used to create this guideline. Relevant articles were abstracted by a trained physician researcher. The first draft was created by the primary author. The entire panel discussed and refined the guideline before distribution to secondary reviewers for comment. The panel then made changes based on the secondary review comments. The objective of this guideline is to assist poison center personnel in the appropriate out-of-hospital triage and initial management of patients with a suspected ingestion of diphenhydramine or dimenhydrinate, or a dermal exposure to diphenhydramine. This guideline is based on an assessment of current scientific and clinical information. The expert consensus panel recognizes that specific patient care decisions may be at variance with this guideline and are the prerogative of the patient and the health professionals providing care, considering all of the circumstances involved. This guideline does not substitute for clinical judgment. The panel's recommendations for dermal or oral exposures to diphenhydramine or oral exposures to dimenhydrinate follow. The grade of recommendation is in parentheses: 1) All patients with suicidal intent, intentional abuse, or in cases in which a malicious intent is suspected (e.g., child abuse or neglect) should be referred to an emergency department (Grade D). 2) In patients without evidence of self-harm, abuse, or malicious intent, poison center personnel should elicit additional information including the time of the ingestion or dermal exposure, determination of the precise dose ingested, and the presence of co-ingestants (Grade D). 3) Patients experiencing any changes in behavior other than mild drowsiness or mild stimulation should be referred to an emergency department. Examples of moderate to severe symptoms that warrant referral include agitation, staring spells, inconsolable crying, hallucinations, abnormal muscle movements, loss of consciousness, seizures, or respiratory depression (Grade D). 4) For patients referred to the emergency department, transportation via ambulance should be considered based on several factors including the condition of the patient and the length of time it will take the patient to arrive at the emergency department (Grade D). 5) If the patient has no symptoms, and more than 4 hours have elapsed between the time of diphenhydramine ingestion and the call to the poison center, referral to an emergency department is not recommended. For dermal exposures to diphenhydramine, if the patient has no symptoms and it has been more than 8 hours since the diphenhydramine was thoroughly removed from the skin, referral to an emergency department is not recommended (Grade D). 6) Patients with acute ingestions of less than a toxic dose of diphenhydramine, or chronic exposures to diphenhydramine and no or mild symptoms, can be observed at home with instructions to call the poison center back if symptoms develop or worsen. The poison center should consider making a follow-up call at approximately 4 hours after ingestion (Grade D). 7) Children less than 6 years of age who ingest at least 7.5 mg/kg of diphenhydramine should be referred to an emergency department (Grade D). 8) Patients 6 years of age and older who ingest at least 7.5 mg/kg or 300 mg of diphenhydramine (whichever is less), should be referred to an emergency department (Grade D). 9) If the patient has no symptoms, and more than 6 hours have elapsed between the time of dimenhydrinate ingestion and the call to the poison center, referral to an emergency department is not recommended (Grade D). 10) Patients with acute ingestions of less than a toxic dose of dimenhydrinate, or chronic exposures to dimenhydrinate and no or mild symptoms, can be observed at home with instructions to call the poison center back if symptoms develop or worsen. The poison center should consider making a follow-up call at approximately 6 hours after ingestion (Grade D). 11) Children less than 6 years of age ingesting at least 7.5 mg/kg of dimenhydrinate should be referred to an emergency department (Grade D). 12) Patients 6 years of age and older ingesting at least 7.5 mg/kg or 300 mg of dimenhydrinate (whichever is less), should be referred to an emergency department for evaluation (Grade D). 13) Following oral exposures of diphenhydramine or dimenhydrinate, do not induce emesis. Because of the potential for diphenhydramine or dimenhydrinate to cause loss of consciousness or seizures, activated charcoal should not be administered en route to an emergency department (Grade D). 14) For chronic dermal exposures of diphenhydramine, skin decontamination (with water or soap and water) should be attempted prior to transporting a patient to an emergency department unless moderate to severe symptoms are already present. In this circumstance, transportation should not be delayed, and EMS personnel should attempt skin decontamination en route to the emergency department (Grade D). 15) Intravenous sodium bicarbonate may be administered by EMS personnel if QRS widening (QRS > 0.10 msec) is present and if authorized by EMS medical direction (Grade D). 16) Physostigmine should be reserved for administration in a hospital (Grade D). 17) Benzodiazepines may be administered by EMS personnel if agitation or seizures are present, and if authorized by EMS medical direction (Grade D).

### Implications of diphenhydramine single-dose unintended ingestions in young children [^7f9f8817]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Diphenhydramine is frequently used in children, but the consequences of single unintended dose exposures in young children are unknown.

Methods

We evaluated 2000–2001 American Association of Poison Control Centers-Toxic Exposure Surveillance data on children exposed to diphenhydramine ingestions.

Results

Nine hundred twenty-six cases met the inclusion criteria; 49.1% were men, mean age was 29.7 ± 13.0 months (range, 1–72 months). Approximately 85% of unintentional exposures occurred in 1- to 3-year-old children. The mean dose ingested was 6.4 ± 6.1 mg/kg (median, 4.6 mg/kg). Thirty-two percent of patients were symptomatic: minor (29.4%), moderate (2.9%), and severe (0.11%). There was no relationship between dose and symptom severity. Diphenhydramine dose ingestion of 7.5 mg/kg or greater was not a predictor of severity (P = 0.47)

Conclusions

The relationship between ingested dose and severity of symptoms was insignificant.

### Adverse events associated with diphenhydramine in children, 2008–2015 [^11db120e]. Clinical Toxicology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction: Diphenhydramine (DPH) exposures in children may be the result of accidental unsupervised ingestions, caregiver error, and intentional misuse of DPH-containing cough and cold medications (CCM). We sought to understand the nature of pediatric ingestions of DPH, particularly the toxicity and outcome of a single product, single ingredient DPH (DPH-only) exposures, in order to derive ingredient-specific information about the clinical effects and course of such cases. Methods: As part of a U.S. multi-year safety surveillance program to assess the safety of over-the-counter (OTC) medications used in cough and cold preparations in children < 12 years of age, an expert panel reviewed cases involving symptomatic adverse events potentially related to oral exposures to these medications. After individual review, the cases were categorized by causal relationship of the reported ingredients to the adverse event, exposure intent (therapeutic, non-therapeutic, unknown intent), and dose (therapeutic, supratherapeutic, or unknown). Following panel review, any disagreement on classification was discussed until a consensus was reached. The data were then analyzed with respect to descriptive findings. Results: The panel reviewed 6618 eligible cases and determined 2802 were at least potentially related to oral exposure to DPH. Of these, 2028 were DPH-only cases (39.1% of all cases judged at least potentially related to a cough and cold medication). The majority (79.5%) of DPH-only cases occurred in children 2 to < 4 years of age and involved accidental unsupervised ingestions (74.7%). Liquid pediatric formulations were the most common (51.7%) products reported followed by solid pediatric formulations (24.0%). The most common adverse events were tachycardia (53.4%), hallucinations (46.5%), somnolence (34.7%), agitation (33.9%), and mydriasis (26.3%). Seizures occurred in only 5.5% of cases. Five (0.2%) deaths were reported; in the death cases, the DPH dose was judged supratherapeutic in one and unknown in the other four. Child abuse was reported in four of the five death cases and three of the five deaths were homicides. Conclusions: Exposures to DPH-only products were the most common type of exposure detected in our study of adverse events associated with CCM in children. The majority of the DPH-only cases were the result of accidental unsupervised ingestions. Most adverse events were relatively mild self-limited anticholinergic effects and few deaths occurred. Deaths involving DPH were often associated with child abuse or homicide. Interventions targeting the prevention of accidental unsupervised are likely to be impactful in preventing morbidity associated with DPH-only exposure.

### Validation of the American Association of Poison Control Centers out of hospital guideline for pediatric diphenhydramine ingestions [^ee2ae5c6]. Clinical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Context

In 2006, the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) published an out of hospital guideline for diphenhydramine overdoses in children. This guideline has not been validated.

Objective

Our objective was to determine the incidence of serious clinical effects or use of medical treatments after unintentional diphenhydramine ingestions in children. We sought to determine if patients with less than 7.5 mg/kg ingestions developed medical complications of diphenhydramine toxicity.

Materials and Methods

In our observational case series, we searched 7 years of data (2000–2006) in the Texas Poison Center Network for diphenhydramine using the AAPCC generic codes. We included only acute, single ingestions of diphenhydramine in children under 6 years old. We included only patients with a recorded weight, known amount of ingestant, and known follow-up. We defined "serious clinical effects" as hallucinations, seizure, wide QRS on electrocardiogram, wide complex dysrhythmia, any conduction block, hypotension, hypertension, rhabdomyolysis, pyrexia, dystonia, coma, respiratory depression, or death. One trained abstractor reviewed the data and entered it into an electronic data collection form. Twenty percent of the charts were audited for abstractor agreement.

Results

Our search resulted in 928 cases. Of these, 305 were included in our study. Of the patients who ingested doses less than 7.5 mg/kg, 99.7% (299/300) did not require critical treatments or were without serious clinical effects. One child was admitted. Five children ingested doses of more than 7.5 mg/kg. All five were observed in the emergency department and discharged home. Two patients had serious clinical effects of hallucinations, one of which ingested more than 7.5 mg/kg. No child required critical treatments. Our agreement on chart review for 20% of the cases was very good for "serious clinical effects" (kappa, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.39–1.0) and excellent for "critical treatments" (kappa, 1.0).

Conclusion

Based on our observational case series, 99.6% of patients who reportedly ingested doses less than 7.5 mg/kg did not develop serious clinical effects or require admission. Pediatric ingestions over 7.5 mg/kg were uncommon in our study population. Serious clinical effects, critical treatments, and admission from diphenhydramine were rare in children under 6 years old.

### Raxibacumab [^4527c5ea]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2.1 Dose and Schedule for Adults

Administer raxibacumab as a single dose of 40 mg/kg intravenously over 2 hours and 15 minutes after dilution in 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP (normal saline) to a final volume of 250 mL. Administer 25 to 50 mg diphenhydramine within 1 hour prior to the raxibacumab infusion to reduce the risk of occurrence and/or the severity of an infusion reaction. Diphenhydramine route of administration (oral or intravenous) should be based on the temporal proximity to the start of the raxibacumab infusion [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

2.2 Dose and Schedule for Pediatric Patients

The recommended dose for pediatric patients is based on weight as shown in Table 1.

Premedicate with diphenhydramine within 1 hour prior to the raxibacumab infusion to reduce the risk of occurrence and/or the severity of an infusion reaction. Diphenhydramine route of administration (oral or intravenous) should be based on the temporal proximity to the start of the raxibacumab infusion. Infuse raxibacumab over 2 hours and 15 minutes. No pediatric patients were studied during the development of raxibacumab. The dosing recommendations in Table 1 are derived from simulations designed to match the observed adult exposure to raxibacumab at a 40 mg/kg dose [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4)].

### Diphenhydramine dose-response: a novel approach to determine triage thresholds [^440a6610]. Clinical Toxicology (2010). Low credibility.

Context

It is unclear how much diphenhydramine (DPH) is toxic in humans. Previous dose-response studies have had conflicting results. Objective. We sought to evaluate DPH dose-response using a unique method that utilizes acetaminophen (APAP) serum concentrations to estimate DPH doses in patients ingesting APAP/DPH in a fixed-combination product.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed APAP/DPH-only exposures in patients 2–80 years of age using case data from 15 U.S. poison centers. DPH dose was extrapolated from measured serum APAP concentrations. A clinically significant response (CSR) was predefined in terms of eight specific manifestations (e.g., coma) that would warrant emergency department intervention. Nominal logistic regression was used to model the probability of each recorded manifestation across DPH dose ranges examining fits for mg, mg/kg, log10 mg, and log10 mg/kg DPH doses. The threshold value where patients reliably became symptomatic was determined by further examining receiver operating characteristic curves.

Results

There were 509 cases that met inclusion criteria. Forty-five patients (9%) developed CSRs. A higher percentage of patients developed CSR at ≥ 7.5 mg/kg DPH and ≥ 1 g total DPH cutoff points (p < 0.05, Fisher's exact test). The best model for predicting the probability of CSR was a logistic fit of log(10) mg/kg dose (p < 0.05). By this model, for every 1 log(10) unit increase of mg/kg DPH dose, the odds of developing a CSR increased 47-fold (95% CI 17, 154). Receiver operating characteristic analyses showed a dose-related progression of symptoms. The cut-point with greatest sensitivity (98%) versus 1-specificity (57%) corresponded to an extrapolated mg/kg DPH dose of 8.2 mg/kg (95% CI 5.6, 10.5).

Conclusion

Our findings support the current American Association of Poison Control Centers' guideline recommendation to refer patients to the hospital for evaluation if they have ingested greater than or equal to 7.5 mg/kg of DPH.

### Diphenhydramine hydrochloride (diphenhydramine) [^49a3604e]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

General

Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has an atropine-like action and, therefore, should be used with caution in patients with a history of bronchial asthma, increased intraocular pressure, hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease or hypertension. Use with caution in patients with lower respiratory disease, including asthma.

Information for Patients

Patients taking diphenhydramine hydrochloride should be advised that this drug may cause drowsiness and has an additive effect with alcohol.

Patients should be warned about engaging in activities requiring mental alertness, such as driving a car or operating appliances, machinery, etc.

Drug Interactions

Diphenhydramine hydrochloride has additive effects with alcohol and other CNS depressants (hypnotics, sedatives, tranquilizers, etc.)

MAO inhibitors prolong and intensify the anticholinergic (drying) effects of antihistamines.

Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility

Long-term studies in animals to determine mutagenic and carcinogenic potential have not been performed.

Pregnancy

Teratogenic Effects

Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at doses up to 5 times the human dose and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to diphenhydramine hydrochloride. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed.

Pediatric Use

Diphenhydramine should not be used in neonates and premature infants (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Diphenhydramine may diminish mental alertness, or in the young pediatric patient, cause excitation. Overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions or death (see WARNINGS and OVERDOSAGE).

### Retrospective review of unintentional pediatric ingestions of doxylamine [^0d71d210]. Clinical Toxicology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Doxylamine is a first-generation antihistamine similar in structure to diphenhydramine. Unlike diphenhydramine, however, there is a paucity of data regarding the risk of toxicity following unintentional exposures in pediatric patients.

Methods

We performed an observational case series with data collected retrospectively from a poison system database for all single-substance pediatric (5 years-old and younger) doxylamine ingestions for the period of 1997–2012. Data collected included age, gender, weight, reason for exposure, exact or estimated maximum dose, clinical effects and medical interventions.

Results

A total of 140 cases were identified; 74 (53%) involved males. Ages ranged 6 months to 5 years. In 30 cases (21%), the exact amount ingested was documented and ranged from 6.25–50 mg with a maximum weight-based dose of 6.2 mg/kg. In 76 cases, the estimated maximum dose ranged from 12.5 to 375 mg with a maximum weight-based dose of 37 mg/kg. All symptoms were mild and self-limiting. The only documented intervention was the administration of activated charcoal in 13 cases.

Conclusion

Unintentional isolated pediatric doxylamine ingestions did not result in significant toxicity in our 140 cases. Reported doses of up to 6.2 mg/kg resulted in only transient drowsiness and tachycardia.

WARNINGS

Antihistamines should be used with considerable caution in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma, stenosing peptic ulcer, pyloroduodenal obstruction, symptomatic prostatic hypertrophy or bladder-neck obstruction.

Local necrosis has been associated with the use of subcutaneous or intradermal use of intravenous diphenhydramine.

Use in Pediatric Patients

In pediatric patients, especially, antihistamines in overdosage may cause hallucinations, convulsions or death.

As in adults, antihistamines may diminish mental alertness in pediatric patients. In the young pediatric patient, particularly, they may produce excitation.

Use in the Elderly (approximately 60 years or older)

Antihistamines are more likely to cause dizziness, sedation and hypotension in elderly patients.

### Successful treatment of paroxysmal movement disorders of infancy with dimenhydrinate and diphenhydramine [^2d2beeed]. Pediatric Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Paroxysmal movement disorders including paroxysmal tonic upward gaze of infancy and paroxysmal dystonia of infancy are benign but uncommon movement disorders seen in young children. Although symptoms are intermittent and resolve spontaneously, they can cause discomfort and distress for the child. Current treatment options are limited to dopaminergic agents or anticonvulsants with limited efficacy.

Patient Description

The authors present a child with paroxysmal tonic upward gaze of infancy and another with paroxysmal dystonia of infancy, both of whom responded successfully to treatment with low-dose dimenhydrinate or diphenhydramine, respectively.

Discussion

Dimenhydrinate and diphenhydramine both exert anticholinergic activity and have limited toxicity at low doses. This property makes either compound an attractive therapeutic option for paroxysmal movement disorders in infancy. These agents are generally well tolerated.

### CDC yellow book 2026: health information for international travel. chapter 7 travel by air, land, and sea [^06a03709]. CDC (2025). High credibility.

Children and motion sickness — pediatric dosing and cautions: Behavioral countermeasures should be tried first, and anti-motion-sickness medication for children should be used with caution. For children aged 6–12 years, dimenhydrinate 12–25 mg per dose or diphenhydramine 0.5–1 mg/kg per dose up to 25 mg can be given 1–2 hours before travel. Some expert healthcare professionals in the United States advise against the use of diphenhydramine in children, note it is not approved for children in many countries, and encourage a test dose before departure. Over-sedating young children with antihistamines can be life-threatening, and scopolamine, including patches, can cause dangerous adverse effects such as hallucinations and mental confusion in children and should be avoided.

### FDA warns about serious problems with high doses of the allergy… [^bab44287]. FDA (2020). Medium credibility.

Drug Safety Communication 09-24-2020 FDA Drug Safety Communication The U. S. Food and Drug Administration is warning that taking higher than recommended doses of the common over-the-counter allergy medicine diphenhydramine can lead to serious heart problems, seizures, coma, or even death. We are aware of news reports of teenagers ending up in emergency rooms or dying after participating in the "Benadryl Challenge" encouraged in videos posted on the social media application TikTok. Consumers, parents, and caregivers should store diphenhydramine and all other OTC and prescription medicines up and away and out of children's reach and sight. FDA recommends you lock up medicines to prevent accidental poisonings by children and misuse by teens, especially when they are home more often due to the COVID-19 pandemic and may be more likely to experiment.

Always read the Drug Facts label included on all OTC medicines to find out if they contain diphenhydramine, how much and how often you should take them, and important safety information. Do not take more than the dose listed on the label, as doing so can cause serious problems. If someone takes too much diphenhydramine and is hallucinating, can't be awakened, has a seizure, has trouble breathing, or has collapsed, immediately get medical attention or contact poison control at 1-800-222-1222 or online. Health care professionals should be aware that the "Benadryl Challenge" is occurring among teens and alert their caregivers about it. Encourage teens and caregivers to read and follow the Drug Facts label. In the event of an overdose, health care professionals should attempt to determine whether a patient with a suspected overdose took diphenhydramine.

Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine used to temporarily relieve symptoms due to hay fever, upper respiratory allergies, or the common cold, such as runny nose and sneezing. It works by blocking histamine in the body, which is a substance that causes allergic symptoms. When used as recommended, it is a safe and effective medicine. Diphenhydramine is marketed under the brand-name Benadryl, store brands, and generics. It is also available in combination with pain relievers, fever reducers, and decongestants.

### Pediatric fatalities associated with over-the-counter cough and cold medications [^88fe3dd7]. Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

In 2008, over-the-counter cough and cold medications (CCMs) underwent labeling changes in response to safety concerns, including fatalities, reported in children exposed to CCMs. The objective of this study is to describe fatalities associated with exposures to CCMs in children < 12 years old that were detected by a safety surveillance system from 2008 to 2016.

Methods

Fatalities in children < 12 years old that occurred between 2008 and 2016 associated with oral exposure to one or more CCMs were identified by the Pediatric Cough and Cold Safety Surveillance System. An expert panel reviewed all cases to determine the causal relationship between the exposure and death, if the intent of exposure was therapeutic, and if the dose was supratherapeutic. Other contributing factors related to the child's death were also identified as part of a root cause analysis.

Results

Of the 180 eligible fatalities captured during the study period, 40 were judged by the expert panel to be either related or potentially related to the CCM. Of these, the majority (n = 24; 60.0%) occurred in children < 2 years old and involved nontherapeutic intent (n = 22; 55.0%). The most frequently involved index ingredient was diphenhydramine (n = 28; 70.0%). In 6 cases (n = 6; 15.0%), the CCM was administered to murder the child. In another 7 cases (n = 7; 17.5%), death followed the intentional use of the CCM to sedate the child.

Conclusions

Pediatric fatalities associated with CCMs occurred primarily in young children after deliberate medication administration with nontherapeutic intent by a caregiver.

### Deviation from national dosing recommendations for children having out-of-hospital emergencies [^e81e0297]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Previous evaluations of medication dosing variance for children in the prehospital setting have been limited regionally or to specific conditions. We sought to describe pediatric dosing deviations from nationally recommended guidelines for commonly administered medications from a registry of prehospital encounters.

Methods

We evaluated prehospital patient care records for children (< 18 years) from approximately 2000 emergency medical services agencies from 2020 to 2021. We investigated dosing deviations (defined as being ≥ 20% of the weight-appropriate dose from national guidelines) for the following: lorazepam, diazepam, and midazolam for seizures; fentanyl, hydromorphone, morphine, and ketorolac; intramuscular epinephrine and diphenhydramine for children with allergy or anaphylaxis; intravenous epinephrine; and methylprednisolone.

Results

Of 990497 pediatric encounters, 63963 (6.4%) received at least 1 nonnebulized medication. Among nonnebulized doses, 53.9% were for the studied drugs. Among encounters who received a study drug and which had a documented weight (80.3%), the overall consistency with national guidelines was 42.6 per 100 administrations. Appropriate dosing was most common with methylprednisolone (75.1%), intramuscular epinephrine (67.9%), and ketorolac (56.4%). Medications with the lowest consistency with national guidelines were diazepam (19.5%) and lorazepam (21.2%). Most deviations represented an underdose, which was greatest with lorazepam (74.7%) and morphine (73.8%). Results were similar when estimating dosages from weights calculated by age.

Conclusions

We identified variance in weight-based dosing from national guidelines for common pediatric medications in the prehospital setting, which may be attributable to protocol differences or dosing errors. Addressing these should be a target for future educational, quality improvement, and research activities.

### Ocrelizumab dose selection for treatment of pediatric relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: results of the OPERETTA I study [^9d17c46b]. Journal of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Trial design and procedures

OPERETTA I (NCT04075266) is an open-label, parallel-group, phase 2 study investigating the PK, PD, safety, and tolerability of OCR in children and adolescents with relapsing–remitting MS (RRMS) aged 10–17 years. The study consisted of four phases: screening (up to 8 weeks); a dose-exploration period (DEP; 24 weeks); an optional OCR extension period (OOE; 264 weeks); and safety follow-up (minimum 48 weeks; Fig. 1 A).

Fig. 1
OPERETTA I A study design and B patient disposition. a One patient discontinued study treatment and continued in the safety follow-up (~ 48 weeks since the date of last infusion). b Two patients switched to OCR 600 mg, one at Week 47.3 and one at Week 76.6. BW, body weight; OCR, ocrelizumab; PD, pharmacodynamic; PK, pharmacokinetic

Eligible patients were assigned to one of two cohorts based on their body weight (BW) at the time of enrollment. Patients with a BW ≥ 25 kg and < 40 kg were assigned to cohort 1 to receive 300 mg OCR IV every 24 weeks; patients with a BW ≥ 40 kg were assigned to cohort 2 to receive 600 mg OCR IV every 24 weeks. As per the adult prescribing information, the first dose of OCR was administered as two IV infusions of half the dose 14 days apart (i.e. 2 × 150 mg in cohort 1 and 2 × 300 mg in cohort 2). Subsequent IV doses were administered as single infusions every 24 weeks. Patients in cohort 1 who reached a stable BW of ≥ 40 kg during the study were switched to the 600 mg dosing regimen (with the first dose again administered as two IV infusions of 300 mg 14 days apart).

Two weeks before each infusion of OCR, a visit was required to collect blood samples and patient information. This enabled the study investigator to confirm that the patient met the retreatment criteria (see Supplementary Information for further information) at the time of infusion. All patients received mandatory prophylactic treatment with an antihistamine (e.g. diphenhydramine) and methylprednisolone dose adjusted to weight (patients < 40 kg received 2 mg/kg and patients ≥ 40 kg received 100 mg prior to the infusion).

Patients underwent regular safety monitoring during the study, including assessment of the nature, frequency, and severity of adverse events (AEs).

### Medication errors from over-the-counter cough and cold medications in children [^79648cca]. Academic Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Out of hospital medication-related adverse events (AEs) from cough and cold medications (CCMs) can have significant public health impact. The objective of this study was to characterize pediatric medication error AEs involving over-the-counter (OTC) CCMs to identify preventable factors.

Methods

Multisource national data surveillance system study using an expert panel evaluating CCM AEs related to medication errors.

Inclusion Criteria

age < 12 years, and at least 1 significant AE from at least 1 index ingredient from a CCM OTC product.

Results

From 2009 through 2016, 4756 cases were determined to have a significant AE related to an OTC CCM ingredient and 513 (10.8%) cases were due to a medication error. Nearly half of medication errors involved children 2 to < 6 years old (n = 235; 45.8%). Many involved administration by a parent (n = 231; 45.0%) or alternative caregiver (n = 148; 28.8%). In nearly all cases (93.2%), the medication error involved the wrong dose of the medication. Health care facility evaluation occurred in 381 (74.3%) cases. Diphenhydramine and dextromethorphan were responsible for most medication errors and medication errors involving health care facility evaluation. There were no deaths from medication errors.

Conclusion

In this multiyear surveillance study, medication errors most commonly occurred in children < 6 years old who received the wrong volume of a liquid product. Diphenhydramine and dextromethorphan dosing errors were the most common cause of medication errors resulting from CCM use. Continued standardization of measuring devices, concentrations, and units of measure along with consumer education are needed to further decrease medication errors from CCMs.

### Systematic review of outcome measures in trials of pediatric anaphylaxis treatment [^5b5018a8]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Results

In total, our combined searches yielded 1996 citations (see Figure 1). After screening, no studies were identified that met all inclusion criteria. The vast majority of references were not articles primarily relating to anaphylaxis, or anaphylaxis treatment. References relating to specifically to anaphylaxis treatment were reviews, systematic reviews, case reports, case series, and other types of observational (usually retrospective) studies. There were a number of controlled trials relating to anaphylaxis prevention, but none about treatment of pediatric anaphylaxis.

Figure 1
Search flow diagram.

The search of the UK National Research Register, Current Controlled Trials, and Clinical Trials using anaphylaxis as a keyword identified no useful proposed, ongoing, or completed studies.

One study registered in the Australia/New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry in March 2011 met inclusion criteria. This was an RCT of intravenous versus intramuscular (control) epinephrine treatment of acute anaphylaxis in an emergency department in patients 15 years of age and older. The status of the trial in the database indicated that the investigators were not yet recruiting as of April 2011. Attempts to contact the primary investigator via email were unsuccessful.

One additional study identified through the search was an RCT comparing the sedative properties of cetirizine versus diphenhydramine in the treatment of acute food-induced allergic reactions in children. The full text of this article was extracted and reviewed and, ultimately, excluded because the condition being studied was not anaphylaxis, but rather all allergic reactions.

### Increased rates of diphenhydramine overdose, abuse, and misuse in the United States, 2005–2016 [^ffbf5d42]. Clinical Toxicology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To describe trends in abuse, misuse, and suicide attempts involving diphenhydramine (DPH).

Methods

We analyzed intentional DPH exposures of individuals ≥ 10years old reported to U.S. Poison Control Centers using data from the National Poison Data System, 2005–2016.

Results

There were 158,774 intentional DPH exposures in our dataset. The rate of intentional exposures increased 63% over the 12-year study period for all ages combined. Suicide attempts involving DPH showed a bimodal distribution-increasing 263% among children 10-14years of age, and 126 and 143% among those 55–64 and ≥ 65years of age, respectively. Older adults in both the 55–64 and ≥ 65-year-old age groups had about a 230% increase in rates of misuse. Major adverse clinical effects increased by 91%. There were 745 total reported deaths with a 3.6% increase across all age groups.

Conclusions

Intentional DPH exposures among individuals ≥ 10years old have been increasing since 2005. Increasing rates of suicide attempts among children ages 10–14 and increasing misuse among individuals ≥ 65, coupled with a trend toward greater severity of overdoses, highlight the significant public health impact of this commonly available over-the-counter drug.

### Fifth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting: executive summary [^4532972f]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric PONV — combination therapy: Combination therapy in pediatric patients is often superior to single agent prophylaxis, with evidence particularly strong for dexamethasone with ondansetron (A1) and more limited for combinations such as dexamethasone with tropisetron and ondansetron with droperidol (A3); however, dexamethasone and droperidol are noted to be less effective than a dexamethasone and ondansetron pairing, and in high-risk pediatric groups (3+ risk factors) a single retrospective study suggests a benefit when adding a third agent (scopolamine or diphenhydramine) to ondansetron and dexamethasone, though this retrospective analysis using historical controls necessitates cautious interpretation and further evidence on three agent regimens is necessary.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Amphotericin B deoxycholate — pediatric adverse effects and infusion reactions are characterized by nephrotoxicity and time-limited febrile events. Adverse effects of amphotericin B are primarily nephrotoxicity, defined by substantial azotemia from glomerular damage, and can be accompanied by hypokalemia from tubular damage; nephrotoxicity is exacerbated by use of concomitant nephrotoxic drugs, related to cumulative dose, and can be ameliorated by hydration before amphotericin B infusion. Infusion-related fevers, chills, nausea, and vomiting occur less frequently in children than in adults, with febrile reactions usually beginning within 1 to 3 hours after the infusion is started and typically lasting for < 1 hour, decreasing in frequency over time. Pre-treatment with acetaminophen or diphenhydramine may alleviate febrile reactions, and other infusion reactions such as hypotension, arrhythmias, and dyspnea are less common in children; hepatic toxicity, thrombophlebitis, anemia, and rarely neurotoxicity also can occur.

Acute cough in children — symptomatic therapies: For children with acute cough, we suggest that the use of over the counter cough and cold medicines should not be prescribed until they have been shown to make cough less severe or resolve sooner (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). For children with acute cough, we suggest that honey may offer more relief for cough symptoms than no treatment, diphenhydramine, or placebo, but it is not better than dextromethorphan (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement). For children with acute cough, we suggest avoiding using codeine-containing medications because of the potential for serious side effects including respiratory distress (Ungraded Consensus-Based Statement).

### Clinical and patient characteristics associated with severe outcome in diphenhydramine toxicity [^02ca55b4]. Clinical Toxicology (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Diphenhydramine is frequently misused and ingested recreationally for its antihistaminergic and antimuscarinic effects and is often involved in both serious and fatal poisonings, either in isolation or in combination with other xenobiotics.

Objective

This analysis sought to determine which patient and encounter characteristics were associated with severe outcome after diphenhydramine overdose.

Methods

This is an analysis of the multi-center ToxIC registry (2010–2016). Descriptive analysis of all cases with diphenhydramine listed as the "primary agent" contributing to toxicity were included. Analysis sought to determine which patient and encounter characteristics were associated with severe outcome, defined as occurrence of seizure, ventricular dysrhythmia, or intubation. To determine which patient and encounter characteristics were individually associated with severe outcome, we performed chi-square tests. Fisher's exact tests were used in the case of sparse data. We also performed multivariable logistic regression to further determine independent risk factors for severe outcome in diphenhydramine overdose.

Results

Eight hundred and sixty-three cases remained after exclusion with 15.6% (n = 135) of all patients having one or more severe outcome. The most common severe outcome was seizures which occurred in 98 (11.6%) of all ingestions. Females comprised 59.1% (n = 510) of all ingestions. Most ingestions were intentional (86.0%, n = 742) with the most common known reason for an intentional ingestion being self-harm, accounting for 37.5% (n = 324) of all ingestions. Self-harm ingestions and ingestions in males were more commonly associated with intubation. When examining outcomes by age, there were no significant differences overall or in any individual outcome except intubation in which children 0–12 were less likely to be intubated as compared to teens and adults. Signs and symptoms most strongly associated with a severe outcome included acidemia (pH < 7.2), QRS prolongation (QRS > 120ms), and elevated anion gap (AG > 20).

Discussion

Acidemia, QRS prolongation, and elevated anion gap are associated with severe outcomes in diphenhydramine toxicity. Further research is warranted to determine their predictive characteristics.

### Intravenous ondansetron reduced nausea but not pruritus following intrathecal morphine in children: interim results of a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-control trial [^3212b657]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

2.3 study protocol

A two‐step rescue protocol for symptoms of nausea or pruritus was followed postoperatively (see Appendix A), designed with assistance from anesthesiology pharmacology experts to adhere to the institution's current standard of care for postoperative nausea and vomiting in pediatrics, whilst omitting ondansetron. The first‐line rescue agent for pruritus was nalbuphine (0.03 mg/kg q6H PRN), with second‐line rescue agent of diphenhydramine (0.3 mg/kg q6H PRN). The first‐line rescue agent for PONV was prochlorperazine (0.1 mg/kg q6H PRN), with the second‐line agent of promethazine (3.125 mg < 40 kg or 6.25 mg > 40 kg q6H PRN). Children who were still symptomatic following these rescue treatments were referred to the on‐call anesthesiologist for assessment; further treatment was at the provider's discretion, with a low‐dose naloxone infusion (dosing range 0.1–3 mcg/kg/min) being recommended. Naloxone bolus was ordered to be given as needed for the treatment of respiratory depression or over‐sedation, per the hospital standard of care for intrathecal morphine.

Trained research assistants, blinded to the intervention, interviewed subjects and sought input from parent or bedside nurse every 6 h for the first 24 h after surgery, with a rest break from 10 pm–7 am. Pruritus was scored as in previous pediatric studies, as 0 = none; 1 = mild/tolerable/not requiring treatment; 2 = severe/intolerable/requiring treatment. Nausea and vomiting was similar scored (0 = no nausea or vomiting; 1 = mild/tolerable nausea/vomiting not requiring treatment; 2 = severe/intolerable nausea/vomiting requiring treatment). The following data were also collected: all analgesics, anti‐emetic, and anti‐pruritic medications administered. Pain scores were collected at 6‐h intervals, using a 0–10 pain scale, or a rating on the pictorial pain "faces" scale, converted to a 1–10 score. Patients and parents were also asked an overall pain satisfaction (Yes/No) question as part of institutional protocol. Any recorded adverse events were noted and were additionally reviewed by the authors (EMP and RAH).

### Safety profile of cough and cold medication use in pediatrics [^36dbcac6]. Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

The safety of cough and cold medication (CCM) use in children has been questioned. We describe the safety profile of CCMs in children < 12 years of age from a multisystem surveillance program.

Methods

Cases with adverse events (AEs) after ingestion of at least 1 index CCM ingredient (brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine, dextromethorphan, diphenhydramine, doxylamine, guaifenesin, phenylephrine, and pseudoephedrine) in children < 12 years of age were collected from 5 data sources. An expert panel determined relatedness, dose, intent, and risk factors. Case characteristics and AEs are described.

Results

Of the 4202 cases reviewed, 3251 (77.4%) were determined to be at least potentially related to a CCM, with accidental unsupervised ingestions (67.1%) and medication errors (13.0%) the most common exposure types. Liquid (67.3%), pediatric (75.5%), and single-ingredient (77.5%) formulations were most commonly involved. AEs occurring in > 20% of all cases included tachycardia, somnolence, hallucinations, ataxia, mydriasis, and agitation. Twenty cases (0.6%) resulted in death; most were in children < 2 years of age (70.0%) and none involved a therapeutic dose. The overall reported AE rate was 0.573 cases per 1 million units (ie, tablets, gelatin capsules, or liquid equivalent) sold (95% confidence interval, 0.553–0.593) or 1 case per 1.75 million units.

Conclusions

The rate of AEs associated with CCMs in children was low. Fatalities occurred even less frequently. No fatality involved a therapeutic dose. Accidental unsupervised ingestions were the most common exposure types and single-ingredient, pediatric liquid formulations were the most commonly reported products. These characteristics present an opportunity for targeted prevention efforts.

### Comprehensive evidence-based review on European antitussives [^09f4b5fb]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2016). Medium credibility.

Diphenhydramine

Diphenhydramine is a first-generation H1 antihistamine approved in some countries as an OTC antitussive, including the USA and the UK. In Germany, diphenhydramine 50 mg is approved as a hypnotic or antiemetic only. First-generation antitussives in combination with oral decongestants are recommended by the American College of Chest Physicians Evidence Based Guidelines for the treatment of cough in common cold and in the so-called upper airway cough syndrome. However, despite the title of those guidelines, this recommendation is based on expert opinion. In cough challenge studies in healthy participantsand patients with acute viral respiratory infection (diphenhydramine combination syrup with decongestant) in adults efficacy could have been established. However, no symptom or objective cough monitoring-based studies are available for acute cough. There is a clear-cut discrepancy between evidence of efficacy and broad clinical use of diphenhydramine/decongestant combinations for acute cough — despite an important sedative effect (dizziness) — especially in the USA. Table 1 evaluates how European antitussives match up to the modern metrics in cough research.

### Atypical experience: a case series of pediatric aripiprazole exposures [^742b8745]. Clinical Toxicology (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Aripiprazole is a new psychotropic agent that possesses a unique pharmacologic profile. The drug demonstrates mixed dopamine and serotonin agonist-antagonist activity and has been labeled a third-generation antipsychotic and dopamine-serotonin system stabilizer. Overdose experience is limited, especially in pediatrics.

Case Series

Of five pediatric cases identified, toxicity was mainly evident in younger patients. A 2-year-old who ingested 40 mg experienced vomiting and significant lethargy lasting approximately 30 h. A 6-year-old who received two doses of aripiprazole therapeutically experienced lethargy, drooling, and flaccid facial muscles which improved with diphenhydramine. Two adolescents remained asymptomatic despite doses of 120 mg and 300 mg while a third adolescent with an unknown dose experienced transient lethargy.

Conclusion

Aripiprazole is capable of producing marked lethargy and gastrointestinal upset in pediatric patients. Adolescents in this series experienced only minor, if any, clinical effects. Major clinical effects, i.e., seizures, dysrhythmias, were not reported in this series.

Chemical restraint for agitation in children and adolescents — The most commonly used medications for agitation are antihistamines, benzodiazepines, and antipsychotics. Choice of medication(s) usually depends on many factors, including the severity and underlying cause of the agitated behavior, collaboration between ED, psychiatric, and pharmacy colleagues, and which medication(s), if any, the patient is currently taking. Diphenhydramine may be used for mild agitation. Benzodiazepines are common first-line drugs for medical causes of agitation. Either benzodiazepines or antipsychotics may be used.

### Oral sedation with midazolam and diphenhydramine compared with midazolam alone in children undergoing magnetic resonance imaging [^e4b87d37]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of oral midazolam and midazolam-diphenhydramine combination to sedate children undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Methods

We performed a prospective randomized double-blind study in 96 children who were randomly allocated into two groups. Group D received oral diphenhydramine (1.25 mg x kg(-1)) with midazolam (0.5 mg x kg(-1)), and Group P received oral placebo with midazolam (0.5 mg x kg(-1)) alone. Sedation scores, onset and duration of sleep were evaluated. Adverse effects, including hypoxemia, failed sedation, and the return of baseline activity, were documented.

Results

Diphenhydramine facilitated an earlier onset of midazolam sedation (P < 0.01), and higher sedation scores (P < 0.01). In children who received midazolam alone, 20 (41%) were inadequately sedated, compared with 9 (18%) children who received midazolam and diphenhydramine combination (P < 0.01). Time to complete recovery was not significantly different between the two groups.

Conclusions

Our study indicates that the combination of oral diphenhydramine with oral midazolam resulted in safe and effective sedation for children undergoing MRI. The use of this combination might be more advantageous compared with midazolam alone, resulting in less sedation failure during MRI.

### Oral immunotherapy for multiple foods in a pediatric allergy clinic setting [^3abd7308]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

Parent Instruction

Parents were advised to give OIT doses with a meal or snack at a time when (1) they would be available to monitor the child for 1 hour after the dose, (2) the child would not exercise or be in a hot environment (including hot bath or shower) just before or for 2 hours after the dose, and (3) the child was not sick with fever, malaise, or significant respiratory symptoms. Parents were instructed in management of OIT reactions at home, with appropriate doses of diphenhydramine (for mild itching or perioral hives) and ranitidine (for post-OIT abdominal pain or nausea) included in postvisit instructions. They were instructed to inject epinephrine if the patient had allergy symptoms that involved at least 2 organ systems, generalized hives, respiratory distress, or protracted abdominal symptoms. If epinephrine was administered, the patient was taken to the nearest ED immediately.

Adverse Events Monitoring

Adverse events were documented by parent report or observation during clinic visits and by telephone call or encrypted e-mail between visits. Parents were provided with the senior author's e-mail address and cell phone number and were asked to report any reactions. If allergic symptoms occurred with a dose, the patient was treated with appropriate medications, and the dose was reduced to the previously tolerated dose, then advanced more slowly as tolerated. All dose escalations were done in the clinic.

Lipid formulations of amphotericin B in children — infusion reaction pattern shows lower overall toxicity than deoxycholate but early-onset reactions in a subset. Lipid formulations of amphotericin B cause less acute and chronic toxicity than amphotericin B deoxycholate, yet in approximately 20% of children they can cause acute infusion-related reactions, including chest pain, dyspnea, hypoxia, severe pain in the abdomen, flank, or leg, or flushing and urticaria. Compared with conventional amphotericin B, most (85%) reactions to lipid formulations occur within the first 5 minutes after infusion and rapidly resolve with temporary interruption of the amphotericin B infusion and administration of IV diphenhydramine; premedication with diphenhydramine can reduce the incidence of these reactions.

Pediatric antipsychotic adverse effects — Risk factors for QTc prolongation and sudden death include coadministration of other QTc-prolonging medications; intravenous administration or high dosage; medically ill patients; electrolyte abnormalities; hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment; and congenital long QT syndromes. Because of this risk, thioridazine and, more controversially, droperidol carry Food and Drug Administration "black box" warnings. Acute dystonic reactions, the most commonly encountered extrapyramidal symptoms, often respond to diphenhydramine or benztropine. Hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia, and obesity are often associated with atypical antipsychotic use, with variable severity between medications. Agranulocytosis is a rare adverse effect most commonly associated with clozapine and less commonly with risperidone and olanzapine.

### Oral immunotherapy for multiple foods in a pediatric allergy clinic setting [^dd67aaa8]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2019). Medium credibility.

OIT Initiation

The starting dose for OIT was based on the highest tolerated dose at OFC, if available. In cases with clinical history suggestive of a higher threshold for reaction and no OFC, a graded series of doubling test doses starting fromtsp was given initially; the patient's daily home dose started with the highest tolerated dose in clinic. Patients with a history of reacting to trace amounts of the food had initial test dosing starting attsp of a 1:10 dilution of the food mixture (or in the case of peanut, with peanut powder diluted in water to give 1 mg/mL of peanut protein).

The parents purchased the foods and processed them at home if needed, per our instructions (eAppendix 1). Foods were brought to clinic the first OIT day and measured by allergy nurses with instructions to parents on how to measure the doses at home. Parents were provided with measuring spoon sets with increments down to tsp and/or syringes for measurement of liquid doses. Measurements were taken by volume (milliliters for liquids or fractions of teaspoons) rather than by weight because this was more practical for the parents to reproduce at home. eAppendix 2 gives the approximate milligram protein content for each food at a given volume measurement.

The OIT test doses were given in clinic, with injectable epinephrine and diphenhydramine oral suspension available; patients were monitored for 1 hour after the final dose. Once a safe starting dose was established, the patient was sent home with instructions to take this dose daily until the next visit. Up-dosing visits were at least 2 weeks and up to 4 weeks apart. At each visit, the dose was doubled, and the patient was observed in clinic for 1 hour after the dose and then sent home with the new dose.

OTC cough medications have little, if any, benefit in symptomatic control of acute cough in children and preparations containing anti-histamine and dextromethorphan were associated with adverse events, including reported death from toxicity in young children. CHEST advises that OTC use for chronic cough in children is the same as for acute cough due to the common cold. Consensus statements: 38) For children with acute cough, we suggest that the use of over the counter cough and cold medicines should not be prescribed until they have been shown to make cough less severe or resolve sooner; 39) For children with acute cough, we suggest that honey may offer more relief for cough symptoms than no treatment, diphenhydramine, or placebo, but it is not better than dextromethorphan; 40) For children with acute cough, we suggest avoiding using codeine-containing medications because of the potential for serious side effects including respiratory distress.

### Drug-induced movement disorders in children at paediatric emergency department:' dystonia' [^777985e1]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Aim

To examine cases with drug-induced dystonic reactions (DIDRs), to identify the complaints of the application, to classify the drugs causing those dystonic reactions (DRs) and to determine the treatment options and protective measures to prevent DIDRs.

Method

The authors retrospectively analysed 55 cases with DIDRs at paediatric emergency department (PED) in a 5-year period.

Results

The mean age of the patients was 145.07 ± 56.30 months, and of the 55 cases, 28 cases (50.9%) were boys. Antiemetics and antipsychotics were the most common causes of DIDRs. 35 (70%) patients developed DIDRs at therapeutic doses. Treatment side effect was the most common cause of the DIDRs (78.2%). The most common DIDRs were abnormal postures of the head and neck (56.6%). Laryngospasm was observed only in four cases (7.3%) that used either antipsychotics or psychostimulants. 51 (92.7%) children were treated with parenteral diphenhydramine successfully.

Conclusion

Dystonia is a common side effect of certain drugs, even when therapeutic doses are administered. Although the most common DIDRs were abnormal postures of the head and neck, rare life-threatening conditions, may develop particularly due to use of antipsychotics. In treatment, diphenhydramine could effectively be used through parenteral way to eliminate the cholinergic effects of those drugs. However, the easiest and the safest way to prevent the development of DRs is to avoid unnecessary drug usage. In conclusion, physicians should be aware that antiemetic and antipsychotic drugs are associated with DRs in normal doses and that those drugs should be prescribed with a correct indication.

### Wide complex tachycardia in a pediatric diphenhydramine overdose treated with sodium bicarbonate [^14669648]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine commonly implicated in overdose. It has many pharmacologic effects, including sodium channel blockade. Overdoses in toddlers causing QRS prolongation are only rarely reported and never with effective use of sodium bicarbonate. We report a diphenhydramine overdose in a toddler with multiple markers of sodium channel blockade effectively treated with sodium bicarbonate.

Methods

A 13-month-old infant girl was brought in by the emergency medical service for a witnessed tonic-clonic seizure. Two hours previously, the child had been found with an open bottle of 25-mg diphenhydramine tablets, 24 of which were missing. Midazolam was administered with seizure resolution. Examination revealed 4-mm reactive pupils; nystagmus; warm, dry, flushed skin; and altered mental status. Initial electrocardiograms revealed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 180 beats per minute, a prolonged QRS of 130 milliseconds (from a baseline of 65 milliseconds), and a positive terminal R wave in aVR, which later resolved after sodium bicarbonate treatment. The patient was discharged home the following day with no sequelae.

Results and Discussion

Diphenhydramine toxicity is a common poisoning in children. Toxicity typically presents with signs and symptoms of the anticholinergic toxidrome. Diphenhydramine also has sodium channel-blocking properties, and this can be shown in the form of prolonged QRS and a terminal R wave in aVR. QRS prolongation and aVR abnormalities from diphenhydramine ingestion in a toddler have been reported, but effective use of sodium bicarbonate has not.

Conclusions

Electrocardiographic finding consistent with sodium channel blockade should be recognized as a complication of pediatric diphenhydramine overdose, and they seem responsive to hypertonic sodium bicarbonate.

### Intravenous ondansetron reduced nausea but not pruritus following intrathecal morphine in children: interim results of a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-control trial [^3c016857]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

2.1 Study treatments

The treatment group received ondansetron 0.1mg/kg, administered as an intravenous 5ml bolus, administered at least 15 minutes prior to the intrathecal morphine injection. This was followed postoperatively by identical ondansetron doses, every 6 h (q6H) for 24 h (not to exceed a maximum of 64mg in 24 h or 16 mg/dose, the maximum dose recommended by the FDA). The placebo group received an intravenous 5ml bolus dose of saline and around‐the‐clock placebo doses for 24 h after surgery, administered in an identical fashion. Both drugs were prepared by pharmacy in identical 5ml syringes, to ensure the blinding of all clinicians and subjects.

2.2 Intraoperative study protocol

The study took place at a single pediatric university hospital. The induction and maintenance of general anesthesia and pain medications were at the anesthesiologist's discretion. Intrathecal morphine dose was 4–5 mcg/kg. All intrathecal injections were confirmed by aspiration of CSF at the start and end of the intrathecal morphine injection. Intraoperative anti‐emetics were given according to the study protocol (see Appendix A): dexamethasone 0.15 mg/kg (max 4 mg) and diphenhydramine 0.3 mg/kg (max 12.5 mg), delivering the standard of care using departmental anti‐emetic administration protocols. Patients deemed at high risk for postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) according to our institution's standard of care, were given aprepitant (2–3 mg/kg up to 80 mg), a fluid bolus of at least 30 ml/kg, and total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), or a sub‐hypnotic intraoperative dose of propofol of 1 mg/kg infused at 20 mcg/kg/min. Ondansetron was not used as part of routine care except in the blinded fashion as described above.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Amphotericin B deoxycholate (Fungizone) IV — For opportunistic infection treatment in HIV-infected children, more frequent toxicities include infusion-related reactions (fever/chills; nausea/vomiting; hypotension; anaphylaxis), anemia, hypokalemia, renal function impairment, and thrombophlebitis at the injection site; less frequent or rare events include blurred or double vision, cardiac arrhythmias (usually with rapid infusions), hypersensitivity (rash), leukopenia, polyneuropathy, seizures, and thrombocytopenia, while gastrointestinal disturbance (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain) and headache warrant medical attention if persistent or bothersome. Special instructions are to monitor BUN, Cr, CBC, electrolytes, LFTs; infuse over 1 to 2 hours and in patients with azotemia, hyperkalemia, or getting doses > 1 mg/kg infuse over 3 to 6 hours; require dose reduction in patients with impaired renal function; avoid other nephrotoxic drugs when possible; nephrotoxicity may be ameliorated by hydration with 0.9% saline IV over 30 minutes prior to the amphotericin B infusion; infusion-related reactions are less frequent in children than adults with onset usually 1 to 3 hours after infusion and duration 1 hour; and pre-treatment with acetaminophen and/or diphenhydramine may alleviate febrile reactions.

### Oral ulcerations in an immunosuppressed pediatric patient [^896f577c]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Question 2: What is the best initial management of the patient?
A. Topical corticosteroids and hematology consultation regarding sirolimus usage
B. Topical analgesics while maintaining sirolimus dose
C. "Miracle Mouthwash" (ie, lidocaine, diphenhydramine, antacid) and stop sirolimus
D. Biopsy
E. Observation

Answers:
A. Topical corticosteroids and hematology consultation regarding sirolimus usage – Correct. Topical corticosteroids provide relief of mIAS, specifically reducing associated pain and lesion duration. However, the causative agent of the oral ulcerations must also be addressed. Since post-transplant immunosuppressive therapy is still required, decreasing sirolimus dose or switching to a different GVHD prophylactic agent is most appropriate. Our patient's oral ulcerations resolved following sirolimus discontinuation recommended by her hematologist.
B. Topical analgesics while maintaining sirolimus dose – Incorrect. Analgesics may be useful adjuvants in some cases; however, analgesics do not address the underlying etiology of the mucosal lesions in this patient.
C. "Miracle Mouthwash" (ie, lidocaine, diphenhydramine, antacid) and stop sirolimus – Incorrect. This solution has been shown to be ineffective in improving the frequency or severity of sirolimus ulcerations as it provides only brief symptomatic relief. Additionally, it would be inappropriate to discontinue transplant GVHD prophylaxis without consulting the prescribing hematologist.
D. Biopsy – Incorrect. mIAS is a clinical diagnosis. Biopsy is not warranted, and there is a paucity of literature regarding specific histopathologic features of mIAS. One in vitro study demonstrated increased epithelial surface disruption, vacuole formation, and early dysplastic changes when oral mucosa was incubated in everolimus compared to control media.
E. Observation – Incorrect. The patient has pain affecting oral intake and quality of life; therefore, intervention is necessary. Use of topical corticosteroids and management of sirolimus therapy address both symptoms and etiology of the lesions. On literature review, permanent resolution of mIAS does not occur while the inciting dose of sirolimus is continued.

### Dose escalation and pharmacokinetics of pegylated liposomal doxorubicin (doxil) in children with solid tumors: a pediatric oncology group study [^326d3479]. Clinical Cancer Research (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

To determine the maximum tolerated dose and pharmacokinetics of Doxil in children with recurrent or refractory solid tumors. Doxil is pegylated doxorubicin.

Experimental Design

Eligible patients were children with refractory tumors who had received cumulative anthracycline doses < 300 mg/m(2). Cohorts of at least three patients each received escalating doses of Doxil starting at 40 mg/m(2) at 4-week intervals. If no dose-limiting toxicity occurred, dosages were escalated by increments of 10 mg/m(2) in subsequent cohorts. Originally, Doxil was administered over 60 min, but significant infusion reactions prompted longer infusion times of 4 h. Patients also received premedication with dexamethasone, ranitidine, and diphenhydramine 24 h before infusion, with ranitidine continued 24 h after infusion. Periodic blood samples were collected and plasma doxorubicin concentrations were quantified to characterize the pharmacokinetics of Doxil.

Results

Between January 1997 and June 2000, 22 children ages 4–21 years with refractory tumors were treated with Doxil. Most patients had received one to five prior chemotherapy regimens, and all but five had prior radiotherapy (two had no prior therapy). Doxil was escalated to a dosage of 70 mg/m(2). At that level, dose-limiting mucositis was seen during the first cycle in two of six patients, thus defining dose-limiting toxicity, and in one additional patient during a subsequent cycle. Grade 4 neutropenia lasting less than 7 days was documented in two of six patients. The dose-limiting toxicity among two of six patients at 70 mg/m(2) was grade 3 mucositis during the first cycle of therapy. Painful desquamating dermatitis of the hands and feet, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, occurred in six patients. In two of those patients, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia started as grade 1 and progressed to grade 2 during subsequent courses. Mean estimates of central volume of distribution, clearance, and elimination half-life were 1.45 liters/m(2), 0.03 liter/h/m(2), and 36.4 h, respectively.

Conclusion

The maximum tolerated dose of Doxil administered every 4 weeks to pediatric patients was 60 mg/m(2). The effect of Doxil on pediatric patients with malignancies remains to be determined and should be studied in pediatric Phase II trials.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^ac9a9f83]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Amphotericin B Lipid Complex — adverse effects and administration precautions include more frequent infusion-related reactions (fever/chills, and headache) and less frequent anemia, leukopenia, respiratory distress, thrombocytopenia, and renal function impairment, while gastrointestinal disturbance (loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain) indicates need for medical attention if persistent or bothersome. Special instructions state to monitor BUN, Cr, CBC, electrolytes, and LFTs, infuse diluted solution at a rate of 2.5 mg/kg/hour, and to minimize immediate infusion-related reactions premedicate 30 to 60 minutes prior to administration with acetaminophen, diphenhydramine, and/or hydrocortisone. Additional guidance notes that adequate hydration and pre-infusion administration of NS may decrease risk of nephrotoxicity, in-line filters should not be used, do not dilute with saline solutions or mix with other drugs or electrolytes, use with caution with bone marrow suppressants or other nephrotoxic drugs because renal toxicity is dose-dependent but less renal toxicity than seen with conventional amphotericin B, and consider dose reduction in children with impaired renal function.

### Low-dose propofol for the abortive treatment of pediatric migraine in the emergency department [^65d705a0]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

Limited progress has been made in the past decade for abortive treatment of migraine headache in the pediatric emergency department (PED). Propofol, a general anesthetic, has been reported to be effective in the treatment of refractory headaches in adults at subanesthetic doses but never in the pediatric population. The goal of this study was to review our institution's experience with subanesthetic doses of propofol for the abortive treatment of pediatric migraine and compare propofol with standard abortive therapy in the PED.

Methods

Retrospective review of all patients discharged from the Oregon Health and Science University PED with a diagnosis of migraine headache from January 2010 to July 2011. Patients treated with subanesthetic doses of propofol were compared with matched controls who received standard abortive migraine therapy, defined as the combined use of a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication, diphenhydramine, and prochlorperazine. Outcome variables of interest included reduction of pain as measured on a self-reported visual analog scale and length of stay after administration of initial abortive medication.

Results

Patients who received subanesthetic doses of propofol achieved significantly greater reduction in pain scores (80.1% vs 61.1%; P < 0.05) compared with matched controls as well as shorter stay (122 minutes vs 203 minutes; P = 0.2) after treatment. No adverse effects (hypotension, respiratory depression, or hypoxia) were recorded in either group.

Conclusions

Propofol seems to be effective for the abortive treatment of pediatric migraine headache in the PED. Further prospective trials are warranted to either support or refute these initial findings.

### Off-label, but on-evidence? A review of the level of evidence for pediatric pharmacotherapy [^13885916]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSION

Our data demonstrate that the overall level of evidence pertaining off‐label prescribing in the pediatric population is low. Because it is not feasible to study all off‐label drugs in children with a low level of evidence for all indications and all age groups, a tailored approach, including extrapolation of existing data and collection of missing PK data, safety, and/or efficacy data, could aid to close the information gap for pediatric prescribing. Our data identify the drugs and therapeutic areas for which clinical evidence is clearly missing and could therefore drive the global research agenda.

### Antihistamine use in children [^8953934c]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2015). Low credibility.

This review provides an overview of the use of antihistamines in children. We discuss types of histamine receptors and their mechanism of action, absorption, onset and duration of action of first-generation and second-generation H(1)-antihistamines, as well as elimination of H(1)-antihistamines which has important implications for dosing in children. The rationale for the use of H(1)-antihistamines is explored for the relief of histamine-mediated symptoms in a variety of allergic conditions including: non-anaphylactic allergic reactions, atopic eczema (AE), allergic rhinitis (AR) and conjunctivitis, chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) and whether they have a role in the management of intermittent and chronic cough, anaphylaxis, food protein-induced gastrointestinal allergy and asthma prevention. Second-generation H(1)-antihistamines are preferable to first-generation H(1)-antihistamines in the management of non-anaphylactic allergic reactions, AR, AE and CSU due to: their better safety profile, including minimal cognitive and antimuscarinic side effects and a longer duration of action. We offer some guidance as to the choices of H(1)-antihistamines available currently and their use in specific clinical settings. H(1)-antihistamine class, availability, licensing, age and dosing administration, recommended indications in allergic conditions and modalities of delivery for the 12 more commonly used H(1)-antihistamines in children are also tabulated.

### Pharmacogenetic gene-drug associations in pediatric burn and surgery patients [^446a5587]. Journal of Burn Care & Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Management of critically ill patients requires simultaneous administration of many medications. Treatment for patient comorbidities may lead to drug-drug interactions which decrease drug efficacy or increase adverse reactions. Current practices rely on a one-size-fits-all dosing approach. Pharmacogenetic testing is generally reserved for addressing problems rather than used proactively to optimize care. We hypothesized that burn and surgery patients will have one or more genetic variants in drug metabolizing pathways used by one or more medications administered during the patient's hospitalization. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of variants with abnormal function in the primary drug pathways and identify which medications may be impacted. Genetic (19 whole exome and 11 whole genome) and medication data from 30 pediatric burn and surgery patients were analyzed to identify pharmacogene-drug associations. Nineteen patients were identified with predicted altered function in one or more of the following genes: CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4. The majority had decreased function, except for several patients with CYP2C19 rapid or ultrarapid variants. Some drugs administered during hospitalization that rely on these pathways include hydrocodone, oxycodone, methadone, ibuprofen, ketorolac, celecoxib, diazepam, famotidine, diphenhydramine, and glycopyrrolate. Approximately one-third of the patients tested had functionally impactful genotypes in each of the primary drug metabolizing pathways. This study suggests that genetic variants may in part explain the vast variability in drug efficacy and suggests that future pharmacogenetics research may optimize dosing regimens.

### Management of primary herpetic gingivostomatitis in young children [^eddf9e99]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the treatment of primary herpetic gingivostomatitis at a children's hospital.

Methods

A review of charts from 1999 to 2003.

Results

Forty-eight cases were identified. They ranged in age from 8 months to 12 years, with a median age of 2 years 7 months. All children were treated with fluids and analgesics; 11 children were treated with fluids and analgesics exclusively. Thirty-five children were treated with a mixture of Maalox and diphenhydramine, 8 with acyclovir, and 7 with viscous lidocaine; 11 children were treated with 2 or more of these regimens. Both the Maalox and diphenhydramine mixture and the viscous lidocaine were administered as swish and swallow, swish and spit, or by application with a swab as frequently as every hour or as infrequently as every 8 hours.

Conclusions

Topical therapy with Maalox and diphenhydramine or viscous lidocaine was administered to 73% and 15% of the patients, respectively, whereas acyclovir was administered to only 17%. Dosing and administration of topical agents in the treatment of primary herpetic gingivostomatitis in preschoolers were problematic. Acyclovir was not being used as often as it could have been.

### Are antihistamines effective in children? A review of the evidence [^8e9a4eef]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Background and Aims

During the last decades, much attention has been paid to off-label and unlicensed prescriptions in paediatrics. However, on-label prescribing can also cause health issues. In this paper, the case of first-generation H 1 -antihistamines is investigated, notably the range of indications for which products are licensed in different European countries and the evidence base (or lack thereof) for each indication, as well as reported adverse drug reactions.

Methods

Review of the Summary of Product Characteristics of first-generation H 1 -antihistamines with a focus on paediatric use. This is plotted against the evidence available in the literature.

Results

This investigation shows a large variability in labelled indications and licensing ages when compared in five different European countries. Moreover, most of the indications are not based on clinical trials evaluating efficacy and safety of these drugs in children.

Conclusions

Many of the licensed indications of first-generation antihistamines do not appear to be evidence based.

### Adverse events related to accidental unintentional ingestions from cough and cold medications in children [^988429ba]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Previous research has demonstrated that accidental unsupervised ingestions (AUIs) were responsible for the majority of cough and cold medication (CCM) ingestions leading to significant adverse events (AEs) in children. The objective of this analysis was to characterize the role of AUIs in the morbidity associated with CCM exposure in children.

Methods

This surveillance study collected data from 5 United States data sources from 2009 to 2016, in children younger than 6 years with an AE from an AUI involving at least 1 CCM over-the-counter pharmaceutical ingredient. An expert panel reviewed each case to determine causality.

Results

From 4756 total cases reviewed, 3134 (65.9%) had an AE from an AUI determined to be at least potentially related to a CCM ingredient. The majority (61.3%) of cases occurred in children aged 2 to younger than 4 years. Most exposures occurred in the child's own residence (94.9%), and 43.8% were admitted to a health care facility (22.0% to a critical care unit). Dextromethorphan and diphenhydramine, when packaged alone or in combination products, contributed to 96.0% of AUIs. The most common specific products involved were single-ingredient pediatric liquid diphenhydramine (30.1%) and single-ingredient pediatric liquid dextromethorphan (21.4%). There were 3 deaths from solid diphenhydramine formulations.

Conclusions

There continues to be opportunities for the implementation of interventions to prevent AUIs of CCM in children. Additional emphasis on engineering controls, such as flow restrictors for liquid formulations targeting diphenhydramine and dextromethorphan products, represent additional opportunities to further reduce AEs from AUIs of CCM.

### Acute dystonic reactions in children treated for headache with prochlorperazine or metoclopramide [^7ca9b4d3]. Pediatric Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The incidences of dystonic reactions to metoclopramide and prochlorperazine have not been well characterized in children.

Methods

Medical record data were reviewed for patients at a tertiary care pediatric hospital who received metoclopramide or prochlorperazine for treatment of headache.

Results

A total of 4588 clinical encounters were identified, 2542 with prochlorperazine and 2046 with metoclopramide. One patient had a dystonic reaction with metoclopramide (0.049%). Eleven patients had a dystonic reaction with prochlorperazine (0.43%). The relative risk of a dystonic reaction with prochlorperazine over metoclopramide is 8.85 (95% confidence interval 1.15 to 68.5). There were differences between groups of patients who received metoclopramide versus prochlorperazine in terms of age, number of doses, and coadministration of diphenhydramine. In a logistic regression, administration of prochlorperazine over metoclopramide (P = 0.019) and greater number of doses (P < 0.001) remained associated with acute dystonic reactions.

Conclusions

Dystonic reactions are rare events among pediatric patients treated for acute headache, but are more common with prochlorperazine than metoclopramide.

### Abatacept GVHD prophylaxis in unrelated hematopoietic cell transplantation for pediatric bone marrow failure [^e84ec9f4]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

GVHD prophylaxis

All patients received Aba (study drug) in combination with standard 2-drug GVHD prophylaxis in an NMD cohort (cyclosporine [CSA] and mycophenolate mofetil [MMF]). CSA was initiated on day −3, with dose adjusted to maintain a level of 200 to 300 ng/mL (via mass spectrometry) and taper initiated between days +100 and +180. MMF was administered at 15 mg/kg per dose (maximum dose of 1000 mg) 3 times daily from days −2 to +30. Aba was administered IV at 10 mg/kg per dose based on actual weight, with a maximum dose of 1000 mg. In cases where the calculated dose was ≤ 110% of a simple multiple of a 250-mg vial, the dose could be rounded down to the nearest multiple. Aba was infused on days −1, +5, +14, and +28 over 1 hour, with diphenhydramine premedication.

Clinical end points

The primary objective of this study was to determine the tolerability of adding 4 doses of Aba (investigational) to standard 2-drug GVHD prophylaxis in pediatric patients undergoing URD HCT for a serious NMD. Tolerability was defined as success in administering all prescribed doses of Aba. Poor tolerability was defined as > 1 dose of Aba being withheld per protocol, death from an infection within 30 days of last dose of Aba (without preceding systemic immunosuppression for GVHD), or posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) within 100 days of last dose of Aba (without preceding systemic immunosuppression for GVHD). Overall tolerability was defined as ≥ 7 of 10 patients tolerating Aba. In addition, infusion reactions, grade ≥ 2 regimen-related toxicities (through day +42, according to Bearman criteria), graft failure (primary and secondary), graft loss, aGVHD and chronic GVHD (cGVHD) (using National Institutes of Health consensus criteria), and unexpected serious adverse events (SAEs) were captured.

### Current regulatory policies regarding pediatric indications and exclusivity [^a8574727]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2003). Low credibility.

Pediatric studies have resulted in changes in the dose of many medications given to children and an increased awareness of safety issues. An additional 6 months of pediatric exclusivity legislated under the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Modernization Act of 1997 for pediatric studies undertaken in response to written requests from the FDA have stimulated the conduct of a large number of studies.

### Manipulation of drugs to achieve the required dose is intrinsic to paediatric practice but is not supported by guidelines or evidence [^92c4d073]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Conclusion

In conclusion manipulations are intrinsic to contemporary paediatrics. The manipulations conducted in the UK are not supported by relevant data and raise important issues of safety, policy and practice. Our data indicates priorities for policy and research in a neglected but important area of medicines management.
