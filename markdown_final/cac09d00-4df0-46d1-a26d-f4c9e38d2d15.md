## Question

what does it mean if a patient scores 15/30 on MoCA test

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what a MoCA score of 15/30 means. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether to apply the one-point education adjustment to the raw score. Then, I should map the final score to validated severity bands. Next, I need to consider alternative cut-offs and crosswalks to verify robustness. After that, I will translate the number into likely cognitive domains affected and functional implications. Then, I should screen for confounders that can artifactually lower the score. Next, I must emphasize that the MoCA is a screening tool and not diagnostic by itself. Finally, I will outline concrete next steps and a concise bottom line, keeping in mind the MoCA's structure as a 30-point cognitive screen validated for detecting MCI and mild Alzheimer's disease [^114kaYxC].

> Let me first confirm the scoring convention and education adjustment, because misapplying this can misclassify severity; the MoCA adds 1 point if the patient has 12 or fewer years of education, capped at 30, so a raw 15 becomes 16 if that rule applies, whereas it stays 15 if education is greater than 12 years [^1179d69y] [^114BAZKQ]. Wait, I should double-check that the cap prevents scores exceeding 30 and that the one-point rule is the standard approach across versions; yes, both the general description and normative data reiterate the +1 point rule for ≤ 12 years without exceeding the 30-point maximum [^1179d69y] [^114BAZKQ].

> Next, I should review where 15 (or 16 if education-adjusted) falls on the commonly used MoCA severity spectrum; the original and subsequent descriptions consistently classify 10–17 as moderate impairment, 18–26 as mild impairment, and ≥ 26 as normal, so 15 sits squarely in the moderate range, well below the typical MCI band [^1179d69y] [^112xmFAf]. Hold on, I should verify that this interpretation aligns with the initial validation that set the widely adopted normal threshold at 26; the original study and later summaries support ≥ 26 as "normal" and document MoCA's superior sensitivity to subtle deficits, which reinforces that 15 is not near-normal performance [^114kaYxC] [^112xmFAf].

> I will now examine whether alternative cut-offs or scale crosswalks might shift the classification; equipercentile linking shows that MoCA 17 corresponds to MMSE 23, a dementia-range MMSE threshold, while MoCA 23 corresponds to MMSE 27, typically used for mild impairment, so a MoCA of 15 lies below those crosswalk demarcations [^114ZBA1p]. Wait, let me verify telephone and abbreviated variants as sensitivity checks; T-MoCA's optimal Youden cut-point can be as low as 17 in diverse samples, and the MoCA-30 remains the most balanced, which again places 15 well below even the lowest studied thresholds, supporting a robust classification of significant impairment across modalities [^1112oXCs] [^113ivmys]. I should also note that some cohorts propose lower "impaired" bands around 23/24 for MCI, but even under those schemes, 15 remains far below mild impairment territory [^113pkDfS] [^114SLmGg].

> Let me translate this number into a clinical picture; the MoCA surveys eight cognitive domains — visuospatial/executive, naming, memory, attention, language, abstraction, delayed recall, and orientation — so a total of 15 implies missed points across several domains, often prominently in attention/executive and delayed recall, consistent with MoCA's factor structure mapping onto standard neuropsychological constructs [^112xmFAf] [^112P7m6c]. Hmm, wait a minute, one perioperative study describes the "memory" line item as unscored with delayed recall capturing those points, which could sound conflicting, but standard MoCA scoring allocates points to delayed recall while the domain framework still covers memory processes, so the overall domain interpretation remains consistent [^1175E4bn] [^112xmFAf]. I need to ensure I also consider function; scores this low commonly correlate with problems in instrumental activities of daily living like managing medications or finances, strengthening concern for a dementia syndrome if functional decline is documented [^112zsqjg] [^114ZBA1p].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions before ruling out confounders that can artificially depress scores; older age and fewer years of education are associated with lower MoCA performance even among cognitively intact elders, and the +1 education correction only partially mitigates that effect, so I should contextualize the score by age and schooling [^113WbNM4] [^112zuBwn]. I should double-check mood, as depressive symptoms can impair attention and processing speed and reduce scores, so screening with a brief instrument like PHQ-9 is appropriate and can clarify whether affective factors contributed [^113qJXfH]. Let me consider language and cultural issues as well; non-native speakers or culturally discordant items can bias results, and validated adaptations like the MoCA-BC illustrate the need for education-stratified cut-offs in some settings [^112ocQ9k]. Next, I should review testing conditions such as fatigue, hearing or vision deficits, and administration modality; telephone and in-person versions show close equivalence when properly administered, but environmental or sensory barriers still matter and should be optimized on repeat testing [^113ivmys] [^117S1CiT].

> I need to ensure we frame the MoCA correctly as a screening tool rather than a definitive diagnostic test; although its sensitivity for MCI and mild AD is high, specificity is only moderate, so a low score rules in the need for comprehensive evaluation but does not by itself establish a dementia diagnosis [^114kaYxC] [^112xmFAf]. But wait, what if guidelines disagree about next steps; both neurology and primary care guidance converge on using brief screens like the MoCA to trigger a structured work-up and, when concern persists, referral for formal neuropsychological testing and evaluation of function and etiology [^1166gMsB] [^113i5AUT].

> Let me now outline the concrete next steps while I double-check for internal consistency; first, reconfirm the raw scoring and apply the one-point education adjustment if ≤ 12 years, then document that the final score lies in the moderate impairment band and communicate this clearly to the patient and family, ensuring teach-back [^1179d69y] [^112xmFAf]. Next, review reversible contributors and testing conditions: screen for depression, review anticholinergics and sedatives, check hearing and vision aids, assess sleep apnea risk, and order targeted labs such as B12, folate, and TSH based on guidelines, proceeding to neuroimaging when indicated and arranging neuropsychological testing with functional assessments to characterize the pattern and severity of deficits [^1166gMsB] [^113i5AUT]. Hold on, I should verify strategies for retesting; use alternate MoCA versions or complementary tools to minimize practice effects and confirm consistency across modalities, as practice effects and administration differences can influence repeat scores [^113ivmys] [^113FVeSN].

> I should confirm the implications for daily care and safety, because that often guides urgency; at a score near 15 with corroborated IADL decline, counseling on medication management, financial safeguards, driving risk, home safety, and caregiver support should begin in parallel with diagnostic clarification, while considering referral pathways to neurology, geriatrics, or memory clinics for timely intervention planning [^112zsqjg] [^113i5AUT]. Let me reconsider whether any disease-specific comorbidity standards alter the pathway; population guidelines outside neurology, such as diabetes care standards, also emphasize formal assessment when cognitive capacity appears suboptimal for self-management, reinforcing the value of early referral and support in multimorbidity contexts [^111z8ydn] [^112G7ziE].

> Bottom line, after I re-check all the above, a MoCA of 15/30 (16/30 if education-adjusted) falls within the validated 10–17 range indicating moderate cognitive impairment, far below the 18–26 band typically labeled mild and well beneath alternative MCI thresholds, which makes the finding robust across cut-points and crosswalks and strongly suggests clinically meaningful deficits across multiple domains with probable functional impact [^1179d69y] [^112xmFAf] [^114ZBA1p]. Therefore, while I must account for education, age, mood, language, and testing conditions, a score this low warrants prompt comprehensive evaluation to determine etiology and to initiate safety planning and supportive measures without delaying appropriate specialist referral [^114kaYxC] [^1166gMsB] [^113i5AUT].

---

A MoCA score of 15/30 indicates **moderate cognitive impairment** [^1179d69y] and is well below the **standard cutoff of 26/30** [^114kaYxC], signaling deficits across memory, executive function, attention, language, and orientation. This score warrants prompt, **comprehensive evaluation** to determine the cause, assess functional impact, and guide management, including neuropsychological testing, medical workup, and safety planning. When interpreting the score, consider education and language, and **add 1 point** if education is ≤ 12 years [^112xmFAf] [^114BAZKQ].

---

## Clinical interpretation of a MoCA score of 15/30

A MoCA score of 15/30 reflects **moderate cognitive impairment** and is well below the **26/30 cutoff for normal cognition** [^114kaYxC], with substantial deficits across multiple cognitive domains [^1137bCQa]. This level of impairment typically affects daily functioning, including memory, executive function, attention, language, and orientation.

---

## Cognitive domains assessed by the MoCA

The MoCA evaluates **several cognitive domains**, each of which contributes to the total score [^114kaYxC]:

| **Cognitive domain** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Visuospatial/executive | Assesses visuospatial skills and executive function (e.g. clock drawing, trail making) |
| Naming | Evaluates language and naming ability |
| Memory | Assesses short-term memory recall |
| Attention | Evaluates attention, concentration, and working memory |
| Language | Assesses language fluency and comprehension |
| Abstraction | Evaluates abstract reasoning |
| Delayed recall | Assesses delayed memory recall |
| Orientation | Evaluates orientation to time and place |

---

A score of 15/30 suggests **significant deficits** across these domains, particularly in memory, executive function, attention, and orientation [^115ao5BM].

---

## Clinical implications and recommended actions

A MoCA score of 15/30 warrants **immediate clinical attention** and further evaluation:

- **Comprehensive assessment**: Conduct a detailed clinical evaluation, including medical history, neurological examination, and neuropsychological testing, to identify the underlying cause of cognitive impairment.

- **Medical evaluation**: Rule out reversible causes of cognitive impairment, such as metabolic disturbances, medication side effects, depression, or delirium.

- **Functional assessment**: Evaluate the patient's ability to perform daily activities independently, including medication management, financial tasks, and driving safety.

- **Safety considerations**: Assess for safety risks, including fall risk, medication errors, and potential harm due to cognitive impairment.

- **Referral to specialists**: Consider referral to neurologists, geriatricians, or memory clinics for specialized evaluation and management.

---

## Factors influencing MoCA scores

Several factors can **influence MoCA scores** and should be considered when interpreting results:

- **Education level**: Lower education levels are associated with lower MoCA scores. A one-point adjustment is recommended for individuals with ≤ 12 years of education [^112xmFAf] [^114BAZKQ].

- **Language proficiency**: Language barriers can affect performance, particularly in language and abstraction domains.

- **Cultural factors**: Cultural differences may influence test performance and should be considered in interpretation [^112waFFX].

- **Age**: Older age is associated with lower MoCA scores, even in cognitively intact individuals [^113WbNM4].

---

## Prognostic significance of a MoCA score of 15/30

A MoCA score of 15/30 carries significant prognostic implications, including an **increased risk of progression to dementia** — particularly Alzheimer's disease [^114kaYxC]. Patients with moderate cognitive impairment face higher risks of functional decline, reduced independence, and increased caregiver burden. Regular follow-up and monitoring of cognitive function are essential to track progression and adjust management accordingly.

---

## Limitations of the MoCA test

While the MoCA is a valuable screening tool, it has **certain limitations**:

- **Not diagnostic**: The MoCA is a screening tool and does not provide a definitive diagnosis of cognitive impairment or dementia.

- **Influence of demographic factors**: Education, language, and cultural factors can influence test performance and may lead to false positives or negatives [^111waFuB].

- **Limited specificity**: The MoCA may have limited specificity in certain populations, necessitating further diagnostic evaluation [^112cq9Ep].

---

A MoCA score of 15/30 indicates **moderate cognitive impairment** with significant multi-domain deficits. It warrants **immediate clinical attention**, comprehensive evaluation, and ongoing monitoring to determine the underlying cause, assess functional impact, and guide appropriate management.

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is widely used for assessing cognitive function in older adults. It consists of eight aspects: visuospatial/executive function, naming, memory, attention, language fluency, abstraction, delayed recall, and orientation. The total score is 30 points, with higher scores indicating better cognitive function. MoCA scores above or equal to 26 are considered normal, scores between 18 and 26 indicate mild cognitive impairment, scores between 10 and 17 indicate moderate impairment, and scores below 10 indicate severe impairment. To account for the impact of education duration, one point is added to the total score for education levels of 12 years or less; if the total score exceeds 30 after adding, no additional points are given. The retest reliability of MoCA used in this study is 0.857.

The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) is the physical function test utilized, developed by American scholar Guralnik and colleagues in 1994. This assessment battery includes three components: the standing balance test, gait speed test (over a 4-meter distance), and chair stand test (five repetitions). These collectively reflect an older adult's individual standing balance, gait speed, and lower limb muscle strength. The SPPB total score is obtained by summing the scores from the three tests, with a scale range of 0 to 12 points. Scores from 0 to 6 indicate frailty, 7 to 9 suggest pre-frailty, and 10 to 12 indicate non-frailty.

Overall cognitive function test

The MoCA is commonly used to evaluate cognitive function. In this study, it was used to screen subjects in terms of overall cognitive function. The total score on the MoCA ranges from 0 to 30, and scores ≥ 26 are considered normal. Eight aspects of cognition are assessed: visuospatial skills, naming, memory, attention, language, abstraction, delayed recall, and orientation. The higher the score is, the better the overall cognitive function. The MoCA has a sensitivity of 0.93, specificity of 0.87, test-retest reliability of 0.92, and Cronbach's α of 0.86.

Measurements of physical fitness

Physical fitness was measured with China's National Physical Fitness Standard Manual (Seniors). This evaluation includes measurements of strength (hand grip strength; kg), speed (15-m shuttle run; s), flexibility (sit-and-reach test; cm), and balance (standing on one foot with the eyes closed; s).

### The Montreal cognitive assessment, MoCA: a brief screening tool for mild cognitive impairment [^114kaYxC]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2005). Low credibility.

To develop a 10-minute cognitive screening tool, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), was designed to assist first-line physicians in detecting mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a clinical state that often progresses to dementia. This validation study was conducted in a community clinic and an academic center.

Participants included ninety-four patients meeting MCI clinical criteria supported by psychometric measures, ninety-three patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score ≥ 17), and ninety healthy elderly controls (NC). The MoCA and MMSE were administered to all participants, and the sensitivity and specificity of both measures were assessed for detecting MCI and mild AD.

Results indicated that using a cutoff score of 26, the MMSE had a sensitivity of 18% to detect MCI, whereas the MoCA detected 90% of MCI subjects. In the mild AD group, the MMSE had a sensitivity of 78%, whereas the MoCA detected 100%. Specificity was excellent for both MMSE and MoCA (100% and 87%, respectively).

MCI as a diagnostic entity is evolving and somewhat controversial. However, the MoCA is a brief cognitive screening tool with high sensitivity and specificity for detecting MCI as currently conceptualized in patients performing in the normal range on the MMSE.

### The Montreal cognitive assessment: Creating a crosswalk with the mini-mental state examination [^114ZBA1p]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2015). Low credibility.

To establish Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) scores that correspond to well-established cut-points on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), a cross-sectional observational study was conducted. The setting was a general medical service of a large teaching hospital.

The study involved individuals aged 75 and older (N = 199; mean age 84, 63% female). The MoCA (range 0–30) and the MMSE (range 0–30) were administered within two hours of each other. Additionally, the Abbreviated MoCA (A-MoCA; range 0–22) was calculated from the full MoCA. Scores from the three tests were analyzed using equipercentile equating, a statistical method for determining comparable scores on different tests of a similar construct by estimating percentile equivalents.

Results showed that MoCA scores were lower (mean 19.3 ± 5.8) than MMSE scores (mean 24.1 ± 6.6). Traditional MMSE cut-points of 27 for mild cognitive impairment and 23 for dementia corresponded to MoCA scores of 23 and 17, respectively.

In conclusion, scores on the full and abbreviated versions of the MoCA can be linked directly to the MMSE. The MoCA may be more sensitive to changes in cognitive performance at higher levels of functioning.

### The use of subjective cognitive complaints for detecting mild cognitive impairment in older adults across cultural and linguistic groups: A comparison of the cognitive function instrument to the Montreal cognitive assessment [^112waFFX]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). High credibility.

This pilot study aims to explore the psychometric properties of the Cognitive Function Instrument (CFI) as a measure of subjective cognitive complaints (SCC) and its performance in distinguishing mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from normal control (NC) compared to an objective cognitive screen, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).

- **Methods**: One hundred ninety-four community-dwelling non-demented older adults with racial/ethnic diversity were included. Unidimensionality and internal consistency of the CFI were examined using factor analysis, Cronbach's alpha, and McDonald's omega. Logistic regression models and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were used to examine the performance of CFI.

- **Results**: The CFI demonstrated adequate internal consistency; however, the fit for a unidimensional model was suboptimal. The CFI distinguished MCI from NC alone or in combination with MoCA. ROC analysis showed comparable performance of the CFI and the MoCA.

- **Discussion**: Our findings support the use of CFI as a brief and easy-to-use screen to detect MCI in culturally and linguistically diverse older adults.

- **Highlight**: What is the key scientific question or problem of central interest of the paper? Subjective cognitive complaints (SCCs) are considered the earliest sign of dementia in older adults. However, it is unclear if SCCs are equivalent in different cultures. The Cognitive Function Instrument (CFI) is a 14-item measure of SCC. This study provides pilot data suggesting that CFI is sensitive for detecting mild cognitive impairment in a cohort of older adults.

### Age against the machine-susceptibility of large language models to cognitive impairment: Cross sectional analysis [^114XcF8w]. BMJ (2024). Low credibility.

To evaluate the cognitive abilities of the leading large language models and identify their susceptibility to cognitive impairment, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and additional tests were used.

- **Design**: Cross sectional analysis.
- **Setting**: Online interaction with large language models via text based prompts.
- **Participants**: Publicly available large language models, or "chatbots": ChatGPT versions 4 and 4o (developed by OpenAI), Claude 3.5 "Sonnet" (developed by Anthropic), and Gemini versions 1 and 1.5 (developed by Alphabet).
- **Assessments**: The MoCA test (version 8.1) was administered to the leading large language models with instructions identical to those given to human patients. Scoring followed official guidelines and was evaluated by a practising neurologist. Additional assessments included the Navon figure, cookie theft picture, Poppelreuter figure, and Stroop test.
- **Main outcome measures**: MoCA scores, performance in visuospatial/executive tasks, and Stroop test results.

ChatGPT 4o achieved the highest score on the MoCA test (26/30), followed by ChatGPT 4 and Claude (25/30), with Gemini 1.0 scoring lowest (16/30). All large language models showed poor performance in visuospatial/executive tasks. Gemini models failed at the delayed recall task. Only ChatGPT 4o succeeded in the incongruent stage of the Stroop test.

With the exception of ChatGPT 4o, almost all large language models subjected to the MoCA test showed signs of mild cognitive impairment. Moreover, as in humans, age is a key determinant of cognitive decline: "older" chatbots demonstrated greater susceptibility to cognitive impairment.

### Comparison of three cognitive exams in cardiac arrest survivors [^1151c9Mx]. Resuscitation (2017). Low credibility.

Cognitive deficits may detract from the quality of life after cardiac arrest; however, their pattern and prevalence are not well documented. We used the Computer Assessment of Mild Cognitive Impairment (CAMCI), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA), and the 41 Cent Test (41CT) to assess cognitive impairment in cardiac arrest survivors and examine the exams' diagnostic accuracy. We hypothesized that the scores of these exams would indicate the presence of cognitive impairment in arrest survivors, that the overall scores on the three study assessments would correlate with one another, and that the 41CT, MOCA, and executive function element of the CAMCI would vary independently from other non-executive CAMCI components, reflecting executive function impairment after cardiac arrest.

- **Methods**: Four researchers administered the CAMCI, MOCA, and/or the 41CT to cardiac arrest survivors after discharge from the intensive care unit between 2010 and 2015. Physicians screened patients with the Mini-Mental State Exam to determine when this cognitive testing was feasible, generally when the patient was able to score 20–25 points on the MMSE. We performed pairwise correlations between the different subscales' and tests' scores.

- **Results**: One hundred and fourteen participants completed the CAMCI, of which 38 (33.3%) participants additionally completed the MOCA and 41CT. The median (IQR) percentile score for CAMCI for all 114 participants was 33.5 (18.3, 49.8), which corresponds to a moderately low risk of impairment. The median (IQR) for the MOCA was 22.0 (19, 24.8) out of a possible 30.

### Association of mental demands in the workplace with cognitive function in older adults at increased risk for dementia [^113pkDfS]. BMC Geriatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Cognitive functioning was assessed using neuropsychological tests during an interview at the participants' homes. The assessment included the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) as a global assessment of cognitive function. The MoCA is a short screening tool designed to detect cognitive impairment, covering domains such as memory, visuospatial abilities, executive function, attention/working memory, language, reasoning, and orientation. Higher values indicate better cognitive performance, with the highest possible score being 30 points. The MoCA has demonstrated higher diagnostic accuracy in detecting cognitive deficits and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) compared to, for example, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE).

Baseline results revealed a mean MoCA score of 24.5 points in the AgeWell.de study population, indicating a mildly cognitively impaired sample, according to the cut-off suggested by the test developers. Test performance was ≥ 26 points in 39.4% of participants, indicating unimpaired cognitive function. However, recent studies of older memory clinic outpatients, as well as meta-analyses, suggest a cut-off of 23/24 points as a more accurate indicator of mild cognitive impairment.

### T-MoCA: A valid phone screen for cognitive impairment in diverse community samples [^1112oXCs]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2021). Low credibility.

The discriminative ability of the instruments for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) was assessed using ROC analysis. This analysis evaluated the diagnostic ability of the T-MoCA, MoCA-22, and MoCA-30 for MCI. The T-MoCA showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.71, which was significantly lower than the MoCA-22 (AUC = 0.79; P = 0.002) and MoCA-30 (AUC = 0.80; P = 0.003). The two in-person versions did not significantly differ from each other (P = 0.23).

- **Classification performance**: Comparisons of various cut scores to classify MCI are shown in Table 3, summarizing the operating characteristics of the three MoCA measures using three different cut scores (Youden's index, sensitivity ≥ 80%, and specificity ≥ 80%). Youden's index cut score, optimizing sensitivity and specificity, indicated that the MoCA-30 was the most balanced, followed by the MoCA-22. At the optimal cut point of 17 based on Youden's Index, the T-MoCA had a sensitivity of 72%, but specificity was only 60%. When setting sensitivity at ≥ 80%, the specificity of MoCA-30 was 57%, followed by the MoCA-22 (52%) and T-MoCA (49%). Setting specificity at ≥ 80%, the sensitivity of the MoCA-30 was 57%, compared to 50% for the MoCA-22 and 41% for the T-MoCA.

- **ROC curves**: See Figure 2 for the ROC curves to evaluate the diagnostic ability of the telephone Montreal Cognitive Assessment (T-MoCA), MoCA subset (MoCA-22), and full MoCA (MoCA-30) for mild cognitive impairment.

- **Operating characteristics**: Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for the MoCA-30, MoCA-22, and the T-MoCA are provided in Table 3.

Thus, the MoCA-30 provides the most balanced diagnostic capability among the three methods for identifying mild cognitive impairment.

### Underestimation of cognitive impairment by Mini-Mental State Examination versus the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in patients with transient ischemic attack and stroke: a population-based study [^115ao5BM]. Stroke (2010). Low credibility.

The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is insensitive to mild cognitive impairment and executive function. The more recently developed Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), an alternative brief 30-point global cognitive screen, might detect more cognitive abnormalities in patients with cerebrovascular disease. In a population-based study (Oxford Vascular Study) of transient ischemic attack and stroke, the MMSE and MoCA were administered to consecutive patients at 6-month or 5-year follow-up. Accepted cutoffs of MMSE are ≤ 27, whereas only 5 patients had MoCA ≥ 26 and MMSE ≤ 27. MoCA < 26 was associated with higher Rankin scores (P = 0.0003) and deficits in delayed recall, abstraction, visuospatial/executive function, and sustained attention. The MoCA identified substantially more cognitive abnormalities after transient ischemic attack and stroke than the MMSE, demonstrating deficits in executive function, attention, and delayed recall.

### T-MoCA: A valid phone screen for cognitive impairment in diverse community samples [^113ivmys]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2021).

The number of individuals at risk for cognitive impairment is growing rapidly as the population ages [1, 2]; yet, dementia often goes undiagnosed or is diagnosed in late disease stages [3]. Sensitive screening measures are essential to identify individuals at risk for future cognitive decline. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA‐30) [4] is a widely used, extensively studied, paper-and-pencil screening tool for distinguishing individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; average sensitivity 85%, average specificity 76%) and Alzheimer's disease (AD; average sensitivity 94%, average specificity 76%) from those who are cognitively unimpaired [5]. The MoCA‐30 has been translated and validated for use in various languages, cultures, and administration modalities [5]. Compared to another commonly used cognitive screen, the Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE) [6], the MoCA has been consistently recognized as more sensitive to mild cognitive changes with similar levels of specificity [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. The MoCA‐30 more comprehensively evaluates a broad range of cognitive domains and more closely aligns with neuropsychological test scores than does the MMSE [16].

Given the rapidly expanding older adult population [1, 2], remotely administered, validated screening tools for cognitive impairment are increasingly necessary and have far-reaching applications. These include use with rural-living individuals, ease of follow-up and disease monitoring, and continuity of care. Telephone [17, 18, 19] and videoconferencing-based versions of the MoCA‐30 have been developed and validated [20, 21, 22, 23, 24].

### T-MoCA: A valid phone screen for cognitive impairment in diverse community samples [^117S1CiT]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2021). Low credibility.

Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were summarized by clinical cognitive status (MCI, NC) and compared using the Wilcoxon rank sum tests for continuous variables, and Chi-square or Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Pearson correlation was used to examine the association between the T-MoCA and MoCA-22. Where appropriate, effect sizes are reported using Cohen's d statistic.

When making direct comparisons, the T-MoCA and MoCA-22 were examined because both instruments contained the same items. Linear regression models were applied to evaluate associations of the T-MoCA, MoCA-22, and the difference scores (T-MoCA minus MoCA-22) between them, controlling for demographic factors (age, gender, education, and race/ethnicity), depressive symptoms, cognitive concerns, and telephone administration difficulties.

To determine whether the T-MoCA and MoCA-22 were equivalent, we conducted formal equivalence paired t-tests. Using narrow equivalence bounds of −0.75 and 0.75 points on raw scores, we tested the equivalence between T-MoCA and MoCA-22 using the two one-sided tests (TOST). Equivalence testing was first introduced in pharmacokinetics to show that a generic drug has a profile equivalent to an existing drug. Subsequently recommended in many research areas, this approach was recently applied in the evaluation of different versions of cognitive tests. The T-MoCA and MoCA-22 would be deemed equivalent if their difference lies within equivalence bounds defined as −0.75 and 0.75 points on the 22-point scale.

### Effects of hypothermia vs normothermia on societal participation and cognitive function at 6 months in survivors after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: A predefined analysis of the TTM2 randomized clinical trial [^1137bCQa]. JAMA Neurology (2023). High credibility.

Global cognitive function by MoCA was assessed for 760 of 939 survivors (81%) and in 607 of 760 by the original face-to-face version (80%). There were no differences between the groups by the MoCA-30, neither in the first analyses including deceased nor in analyses of survivors only. While the median MoCA-30 score was within the normal range for both the hypothermia (27; IQR, 23–29) and the normothermia group (26; IQR, 23–28), 149 of 384 in the hypothermia group (39%) and 160 of 376 in the normothermia group (43%) had MoCA-30 scores below the cutoff indicating cognitive impairment. The most affected MoCA-30 items were verbal fluency and delayed recall. Results were similar between MoCA performed face-to-face and T-MoCA.

- **Secondary analyses of cognitive function for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survivors with hypothermia vs normothermia**: Mental processing speed/attention by the SDMT was assessed for 601 of 939 participants (64%). There were no differences between groups for SDMT in any of the analyses.

### Effect of interactive cognitive-motor training on eye-hand coordination and cognitive function in older adults [^114SLmGg]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Low credibility.

The study examined the secondary outcome of cognitive function using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to assess participants. According to previous research, the MoCA test more effectively screens for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in patients over 60 years of age compared to the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). The MoCA demonstrated higher sensitivity in detecting cognitive decline over time.

In addition to calculating the overall cognitive function score, scores for seven sub-items were evaluated: visuospatial/executive, naming, attention, language (language fluency), abstraction, delayed recall, and orientation. The test duration was approximately 10–15 minutes. For participants with less than 12 years of education, 1 point was added to their total score. The highest possible score is 30, with a higher score indicating better cognitive function.

To differentiate between normal cognitive aging and mild cognitive impairment, the discriminating power of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.91 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.86–1.00). Compared to the area under the curve (AUC) value of MMSE, which was 0.81 (95% CI = 0.72–0.89), the ROC curve showed higher discriminating power. For the Taiwanese version used in this study, a cut-off score of 23/24 has been suggested for individuals with mild cognitive impairment, offering a sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 78%, respectively.

The sample size was calculated using G-Power software. The F test, MANOVA test, repeated measures test, and between-factor tests were employed, with an effect size set at 0.32.

### Practice guideline update summary: Mild cognitive impairment [RETIRED]: Report of the Guideline Development, Dissemination, and Implementation Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology [^1166gMsB]. Neurology (2018). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for mild cognitive impairment, the 2018 guidelines from the American Academy of Neurology recommend assessing for MCI in situations where either the patient or a close contact raises concerns about memory or impaired cognition. This approach is advised rather than assuming such issues are part of normal aging.

### Montreal cognitive assessment reflects cognitive reserve [^114MDhgt]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). High credibility.

This study confirms that the MoCA reflects cognitive reserve (CR) and that CR is reflected more sensitively by the MoCA score than the MMSE score. The clinical use of the MoCA is expected to increase markedly because it provides an easy way to evaluate cognitive function and CR, without any additional tests or large-scale batteries. This study may provide valuable insight for future, large community-based studies of early cognitive decline and CR.

### Montreal cognitive assessment reflects cognitive reserve [^115eUaSV]. BMC Geriatrics (2018). Low credibility.

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is known to have discriminative power for patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Recently, cognitive reserve (CR) has been introduced as a factor that compensates for cognitive decline. We aimed to assess whether the MoCA reflects CR. Furthermore, we assessed whether there were any differences in efficacy between the MoCA and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) in reflecting CR.

- **Methods**: MoCA, MMSE, and the Cognitive Reserve Index questionnaire (CRIq) were administered to 221 healthy participants. Normative data and associated factors of the MoCA were identified. Correlation and regression analyses of the MoCA, MMSE, and CRIq scores were performed, and the MoCA score was compared with the MMSE score to evaluate the degree to which the MoCA reflected CR.

- **Results**: The MoCA reflected total CRIq score (CRI; B = 0.076, P < 0.001), CRI-Education (B = 0.066, P < 0.001), and CRI-Working activity (B = 0.025, P = 0.042), while MMSE reflected total CRI (B = 0.044, P < 0.001) and CRI-Education (B = 0.049, P < 0.001) only. The MoCA differed from the MMSE in the reflection of total CRI (Z = 2.30).

- **Conclusion**: In this study, we show that the MoCA score reflects CR more sensitively than the MMSE score. Therefore, we suggest that MoCA can be used to assess CR and early cognitive decline.

### Comparative sensitivity of the MoCA and Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-2 in Parkinson's disease [^116gUNu4]. Movement Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

Clinicians and researchers commonly use global cognitive assessments to screen for impairment. Currently, there are no published studies directly comparing the sensitivity and specificity of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-2 in Parkinson's disease (PD). The objective of this study was to identify the relative sensitivity and specificity of the MoCA and Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-2 in PD.

- **Methods**: The MoCA and Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-2 were administered to training and validation cohorts. Cutoff scores were determined within the training cohort (n = 85) to optimize sensitivity and specificity for cognitive impairment and were applied to an independent validation cohort (n = 521).

- **Results**: The MoCA was consistently sensitive across training and validation cohorts (90.0% and 80.3%, respectively), whereas the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-2 was not (87.5% and 60.3%, respectively). In individual domains, the MoCA remained sensitive to memory and visuospatial impairments (91.9% and 87.8%, respectively), whereas the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-2 was sensitive to executive impairments (86.2%).

- **Conclusion**: The MoCA and Mattis Dementia Rating Scale-2 demonstrated individual strengths. Future work should focus on developing domain-specific cognitive screening tools for PD.

### The Memtrax test compared to the Montreal cognitive assessment estimation of mild cognitive impairment [^114vZRyj]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2019). Low credibility.

The MemTrax test was provided by MemTrax, LLC (Redwood City, CA, USA) as a courtesy in its full version. The test displays a series of 50 images for up to three seconds each. Subjects are instructed to respond quickly by pressing the spacebar, indicated by a red tape, whenever an exact repeated image appears, which constitutes half of the images (25/50). Upon response, the subsequent image is shown immediately. After completing the test, the program provides the percentage of correct responses (MTX correct) and the average reaction time in seconds for repeated images. This average time reflects the duration needed to press the spacebar upon recognizing a repeated image. Reaction time is converted into reaction speed (MTX speed) by using the formula 1 divided by the reaction time (i.e. 1/MTX reaction time). Individual MTX scores and their validity history are stored online in the user's test account.

To ensure validity, tests needed to meet the following criteria: no more than five false positive responses, at least ten correct recognitions, and an average recognition time between 0.4 and 2 seconds. Only valid tests were considered in the analysis. Before the actual MTX test administration, detailed explanations and a practice test were provided. This preparation included an overview of the test, instruction, and count-down pages to help participants become familiar with the site's layout and the initial steps required before beginning the test.

### T-MoCA: A valid phone screen for cognitive impairment in diverse community samples [^115ssGM8]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2021). Low credibility.

The MoCA-30, included in the in-person cognitive battery, assesses aspects of memory, executive function, attention, concentration, language, abstract reasoning, and orientation, with a maximum score of 30. Two alternate forms of the MoCA-30 are available to decrease the likelihood of practice effects due to repeated administration of identical items. At baseline, version 7.2 was administered. Scoring details are shown in Table S1 in supporting information.

The MoCA-22 includes a subset of items from the in-person MoCA-30 (version 7.2), excluding items that require visual cues or drawing, with a maximum score of 22 points. The MoCA-22 was derived for comparison to the T-MoCA.

The T-MoCA is a modified version of the MoCA-30 (version 7.1) administered by phone, with minor modifications to scoring. Just as with the MoCA-22, this phone version excludes items that require visual stimuli and pencil and paper drawing, with the same maximum score. At baseline, two alternate versions of the MoCA were administered: version 7.1 was administered on the telephone and the alternate form (version 7.2) was administered in-person.

- **Covariates**: Demographic information included self-reported race/ethnicity as defined by the US Census Bureau in 1994, number of years of education, gender, and age. The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS, short form) was used to screen for depressive symptoms. The GDS ranges from 0 to 15 with scores of 6 or above suggestive of clinically significant depressive symptoms.

### Tracking cognition with the T-MoCA in a racially/ethnically diverse older adult cohort [^11457Sfs]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). High credibility.

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a widely used cognitive screening tool that evaluates various cognitive domains, including memory, executive functioning, attention, concentration, language, abstract reasoning, visuospatial construction, and orientation. The MoCA-30, the original version, is available freely and has a maximum score of 30, with higher scores denoting stronger cognitive performance. An adapted version, the MoCA-22, excludes items requiring visual input or drawing, thus having a maximum score of 22 points. This adaptation was derived for comparison with the T-MoCA.

The T-MoCA is a telephone-administered version of the MoCA-30. Similar to the MoCA-22, it omits items that require visual stimuli and drawing, maintaining the same maximum score. At baseline (wave 1) and during annual follow-ups (waves 2–5), the T-MoCA was administered on average 23.4 days before the MoCA-30, with a range from 1 to 106 days. Different versions of the MoCA were used across formats and waves to minimize practice effects. Specifically, version 7.1 was used during the phone interview at baseline, while version 7.2 was used during the in-person clinic visit. At the wave 2 follow-up, version 7.2 was administered via phone and version 7.1 in person; this rotation pattern was maintained throughout subsequent waves.

- **Race/ethnicity**: Self-reports were obtained and categorized based on the U.S. Census Bureau's 1994 designations, including non-Hispanic White (NH-W), non-Hispanic Black (NH-B), Hispanic (encompassing both White and Black), Asian, and multiracial participants.

### Montreal cognitive assessment performance in patients with Parkinson's disease with "normal" global cognition according to mini-mental state examination score [^113VypYH]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2009). Low credibility.

To examine Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) performance in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) with "normal" global cognition according to Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, a cross-sectional comparison of the MoCA and the MMSE was conducted. This study was set in two movement disorders centers at the University of Pennsylvania and the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical Center and involved a convenience sample of 131 patients with idiopathic PD who were screened for cognitive and psychiatric complications.

Subjects were administered the MoCA and MMSE, and only those with a normal age- and education-adjusted MMSE score were included in the analyses (N = 100). As previously recommended in patients without PD, a MoCA score less than 26 indicated the presence of at least mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

Mean MMSE and MoCA scores, plus/minus standard deviation, were 28.8 ± 1.1 and 24.9 ± 3.1, respectively. More than half (52.0%) of subjects with normal MMSE scores had cognitive impairment according to their MoCA score. Impairments were observed in numerous cognitive domains, including memory, visuospatial and executive abilities, attention, and language. Predictors of cognitive impairment on the MoCA using univariate analyses included male sex, older age, lower educational level, and greater disease severity. However, older age was the only significant predictor in a multivariate model.

Approximately half of patients with PD with a normal MMSE score have cognitive impairment based on the recommended MoCA cutoff score. These findings suggest…

### Aricept ODT [^115xC6AM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The effectiveness of Aricept as a treatment for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease is demonstrated by the results of two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical investigations in patients with Alzheimer's disease (diagnosed by NINCDS and DSM III-R criteria, Mini-Mental State Examination ≥ 10 and ≤ 26, and Clinical Dementia Rating of 1 or 2). The mean age of patients participating in Aricept trials was 73 years, with a range of 50 to 94. Approximately 62% of patients were women and 38% were men. The racial distribution was 95% white, 3% black, and 2% other races.

The higher dose of 10 mg did not provide a statistically significantly greater clinical benefit than 5 mg. There is a suggestion, however, based on the order of group mean scores and dose trend analyses from these clinical trials, that a daily dose of 10 mg of Aricept might provide additional benefit for some patients. Accordingly, whether or not to employ a dose of 10 mg is a matter of prescriber and patient preference.

- **Study outcome measures**: In each study, the effectiveness of treatment with Aricept was evaluated using a dual outcome assessment strategy. The ability of Aricept to improve cognitive performance was assessed with the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog), a multi-item instrument extensively validated in longitudinal cohorts of Alzheimer's disease patients. The ADAS-cog examines selected aspects of cognitive performance, including elements of memory, orientation, attention, and reasoning.

### Prolonged physical inactivity in older adult couples: A dyadic analysis using actigraphy [^112zsqjg]. Innovation in Aging (2021). Low credibility.

Cognitive function was measured by the MoCA, which assesses cognitive domains including short-term memory recall, visuospatial abilities, executive function, attention, concentration, working memory, language, and orientation. The MoCA consists of 30 items, with a total score ranging from 0 to 30, where a higher score indicates better cognitive function. It has excellent sensitivity (90%) and specificity (87%) for detecting mild cognitive impairment.

Functional independence was assessed using the Older Americans Resources and Services (OARS) Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) Scale. The OARS-IADL Scale, widely used with older adults, consists of 6 items related to functional independence in common household activities such as telephone use, shopping, meal preparation, housework, medication management, and financial management. Each item was rated on a 3-point Likert-like scale, from 0 "Without help" to 2 "Completely unable to". The total score ranges from 0 to 12, with a higher score indicating greater dependency in IADL. The OARS has demonstrated interrater reliability (0.67–0.87) and validity (0.60–0.83).

Illness and comorbidity were measured by the modified Cumulative Illness Rating Scale-Geriatric (CIRS-G). The modified CIRS-G includes 14 items, each rated on a 5-point Likert-like scale from 1 "None" to 5 "Extremely severe". The total score ranges from 14 to 70, where a higher score indicates more severe comorbidity. The CIRS-G has shown good interrater reliability with intraclass correlations between 0.78 and 0.88.

Gait speed was measured by a complete 15-foot out and back gait test.

### Relationship between the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and Mini-mental State Examination for assessment of mild cognitive impairment in older adults [^115SDNKK]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

This cross-sectional study analyzed 618 cases from the ADNI-GO and ADNI-2 databases where both MMSE and MoCA tests were performed within ± 90 days of the clinical diagnosis. Data were downloaded from the October 2012 release. ADNI is a multi-site, multi-study program funded by a public and private partnership to investigate whether the combination of neuroimaging, biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessments can accurately track progression in Alzheimer's disease. Data are publicly available to the scientific community for analyses. Informed consent is collected through the participating ADNI sites. The ADNI-GO and ADNI-2 studies were conducted according to Good Clinical Practice guidelines, US 21CFR Part 50 – Protection of Human Subjects, and Part 56 – Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)/Research Ethics Boards (REBs), and pursuant to state and federal HIPAA regulations. Study protocols were approved by each site's IRB/REB.

At the entry visit into ADNI, cohort subjects received an initial diagnosis according to specific criteria. AD dementia subjects had MMSE scores between 20–26 (inclusive), Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR) scores of either 0.5 or 1.0, and all met National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke/Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for probable AD. MCI subjects had a memory complaint, MMSE scores between 24–30, and objective memory loss as measured by education-adjusted scores on the Wechsler Memory Scale.

### Relationship between the Montreal cognitive assessment and Mini-mental state examination for assessment of mild cognitive impairment in older adults [^115jgbVc]. BMC Geriatrics (2015). Low credibility.

We found that MMSE scores exhibited a more pronounced ceiling effect than MoCA for HC and MCI cases. Using ADNI data, in order to detect a similar number of MCI cases using an MMSE cutoff of ≥ 24, the MoCA cutoff needs to be lowered to between ≥ 17 to ≥ 19, depending on the preference for more sensitivity or specificity versus dementia. The more difficult content in the MoCA may enhance its sensitivity to detect earlier symptoms when the upper MCI score is 30.

We recommend that the MoCA be used in conjunction with a functional scale such as the FAQ to distinguish dementia cases whose scores overlap in the MCI range, and a more sophisticated executive function or episodic memory test to distinguish milder MCI as it transitions from normal. Also, based on stepwise regression, testing the orientation or core domain on either the MMSE or MoCA may help distinguish HC from MCI cases, though this needs to be further evaluated in other samples.

### Defining and validating a short form Montreal cognitive assessment (s-MoCA) for use in neurodegenerative disease [^116WVUMh]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2016). Low credibility.

Screening for cognitive deficits is essential in neurodegenerative disease. Screening tests, such as the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), are easily administered, correlate with neuropsychological performance, and demonstrate diagnostic utility. Yet, the administration time is too long for many clinical settings.

- **Methods**: Item response theory and computerized adaptive testing simulation were employed to establish an abbreviated MoCA in 1,850 well-characterized community-dwelling individuals with and without neurodegenerative disease.

- **Results**: Eight MoCA items with high item discrimination and appropriate difficulty were identified for use in a short form (s-MoCA). The s-MoCA was highly correlated with the original MoCA and showed robust diagnostic classification; cross-validation procedures substantiated these items.

- **Discussion**: Early detection of cognitive impairment is an important clinical and public health concern, but the administration of screening measures is limited by time constraints in demanding clinical settings. Here, we provide an s-MoCA that is valid across neurological disorders and can be administered in approximately 5 minutes.

### The MoCA: well-suited screen for cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease [^113hkSjX]. Neurology (2010). Low credibility.

To establish the diagnostic accuracy of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) when screening externally validated cognition in Parkinson's disease (PD), a comparison was made with a PD-focused test, the Scales for Outcomes in Parkinson disease-Cognition (SCOPA-COG), and the standardized Mini-Mental State Examination (S-MMSE) as benchmarks.

A convenience sample of 114 patients with idiopathic PD and 47 healthy controls was examined in a movement disorders center. The 21 patients with dementia (PD-D) were diagnosed using Movement Disorders Society criteria, externally validated by detailed, independent functional and neuropsychological tests. The 21 patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) scored 1.5 SD or more below normative data in at least two measures in one of four cognitive domains. Other patients had normal cognition (PD-N).

Primary outcomes using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses showed that all three mental status tests produced excellent discrimination of PD-D from patients without dementia (area under the curve [AUC], 87%-91%) and PD-MCI from PD-N patients (AUC, 78%-90%). However, the MoCA was generally better suited across both assessments. The optimal MoCA screening cutoffs were < 21/30 for PD-D (sensitivity 81%; specificity 95%; negative predictive value [NPV] 92%) and < 26/30 for PD-MCI (sensitivity 90%; specificity 75%; NPV 95%). Further support that the MoCA is at least equivalent to the SCOPA-COG and superior to the S-MMSE was provided by the simultaneous classification of the three PD patient groups.

### Factors that indicate performance on the MoCA 7.3 in healthy adults over 50 years old [^112zuBwn]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Human aging is a physiological, progressive, heterogeneous global process that causes a decline of all body systems, functions, and organs. Throughout this process, cognitive function suffers an incremental decline with broad interindividual variability. The first objective of this study was to examine the differences in the performance on the MoCA test (version 7.3) per gender and the relationship between the performance and the variables age, years of schooling, and depressive symptoms. The second objective was to identify factors that may influence the global performance on the MoCA test (v. 7.3) and the domains of orientation, language, memory, attention/calculation, visuospatial and executive function, abstraction, and identification.

A cross-sectional study was carried out in which five hundred seventy-three cognitively healthy adults aged 50 years or older were included in the study. A sociodemographic questionnaire, the GDS-15 questionnaire to assess depression symptoms, and the Spanish version of the MoCA Test (v. 7.3) were administered. The evaluations were carried out between the months of January and June 2022. Differences in the MoCA test performance per gender were assessed with Student's t-test for independent samples. The bivariate Pearson correlation was applied to examine the relationship between total scoring of the MoCA test performance and the variables age, years of schooling, and depressive symptoms. Different linear multiple regression analyses were performed to determine variables that could influence the MoCA test performance. We found gender-related MoCA Test performance differences.

### Montreal cognitive assessment 5-minute protocol is a brief, valid, reliable, and feasible cognitive screen for telephone administration [^116N4yfW]. Stroke (2015). Low credibility.

The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Canadian Stroke Network Vascular Cognitive Impairment Harmonization working group proposed a brief cognitive protocol for screening of vascular cognitive impairment. We investigated the validity, reliability, and feasibility of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment 5-minute protocol (MoCA 5-minute protocol) administered over the telephone.

- **Methods**: Four items examining attention, verbal learning and memory, executive functions/language, and orientation were extracted from the MoCA to form the MoCA 5-minute protocol. One hundred four patients with stroke or transient ischemic attack, including 53 with normal cognition (Clinical Dementia Rating, 0) and 51 with cognitive impairment (Clinical Dementia Rating, 0.5 or 1), were administered the MoCA in clinic and a month later, the MoCA 5-minute protocol over the telephone.

- **Results**: Administration of the MoCA 5-minute protocol took 5 minutes over the telephone. Total score of the MoCA 5-minute protocol correlated negatively with age (r = -0.36; P < 0.05 for difference; Cohen d for group difference, 0.80–1.13). It differentiated cognitive impairment effectively.

### Is the Montreal cognitive assessment superior to the mini-mental state examination to detect poststroke cognitive impairment? A study with neuropsychological evaluation [^112cq9Ep]. Stroke (2011). Low credibility.

A screening test is required to improve the diagnosis of poststroke cognitive impairment. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), a newly designed screening test, has been found to be more sensitive than the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), but its clinical value has not been established via a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. This study was designed to assess the value of MoCA and MMSE in detecting poststroke cognitive impairment determined by a neuropsychological battery.

- **Methods**: Both screening tests and a neuropsychological battery were administered during the acute phase in 95 patients referred for recent infarct or hemorrhage. Raw MMSE and MoCA scores were used with published cutoffs. New cutoff scores for MMSE and MoCA were also computed after adjustment for age and education.

- **Results**: Using raw scores, MoCA was more frequently impaired (P = 0.0001) than MMSE. MoCA showed good sensitivity (sensitivity, 0.94) but moderate specificity (specificity, 0.42; positive predictive value, 0.77; negative predictive value, 0.76), whereas an inverse profile was observed for MMSE (sensitivity, 0.66; specificity, 0.97; positive predictive value, 0.98; negative predictive value, 0.58). Adjusted scores with new cutoffs (MMSE(adj) ≤ 24, MoCA(adj) ≤ 20) provided good sensitivity and very good specificity for both tests (MMSE(adj): sensitivity, 0.7, specificity, 0.97, positive predictive value, 0.98, negative predictive value, 0.61; MoCA(adj): sensitivity, 0.67, specificity, 0.9, positive predictive value, 0.93, negative predictive value, 0.57).

### T-moca: A valid phone screen for cognitive impairment in diverse community samples [^111waFuB]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2021). Low credibility.

Scores on the MoCA‐22 and T‐MoCA were significantly associated with education, race/ethnicity, depressive symptoms, and telephone administration difficulties. Age was significantly related to the MoCA‐22 only, while gender and self-reported cognitive concerns were significantly associated only with the T‐MoCA, although the associations of these factors with both modalities of the MoCA trended in the same direction.

Older age, Black or "All others" ethnicity (consisting of Hispanics and Others/more than one race), higher GDS scores, presence of telephone administration difficulties, and greater cognitive concerns were associated with worse MoCA performance on either instrument. In contrast, higher education and being a woman were associated with better performance.

- **Association of MoCA‐22, T‐MoCA, and the difference between the T‐MoCA and MoCA‐22 with demographics, depression, subjective concerns, and issues related to telephone administration**: The difference in scores between the T‐MoCA and the MoCA‐22 was also computed for each participant. The mean difference was −0.04, SD = 2.56, 95% (confidence interval [CI]: −0.28 to 0.21), and the difference in scores was not related to any demographic factor, GDS, cognitive concerns, or telephone issues. The difference between the T‐MoCA and the MoCA‐22 was not significantly different from zero (P = 0.76) using a paired t-test. The equivalence test concluded that the T‐MoCA and the MoCA‐22 were equivalent (P < 0.0001).

### The Montreal cognitive assessment in cognitively-intact elderly: A case for age-adjusted cutoffs [^113WbNM4]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2015). Low credibility.

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a widely used screening test for the evaluation of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), with a single cutoff for all ages. We examined whether it is associated with age in a sample of cognitively-intact elderly (CIE). The average MoCA score was negatively correlated with age and was significantly higher for younger than older CIE. Additionally, 42% of the older elderly fell below the proposed MCI cutoff score, although all subjects were CIE. Thus, cognitive abilities captured by the MoCA test decrease with age, even in CIE. Therefore, cutoff scores by age for the MoCA are needed.

### Subjective versus objective assessment of cognitive functioning in primary care [^113zmF21]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

This study examined the clinical utility of highly efficient subjective and objective screens of cognitive impairment.

- **Method**: Participants (N = 124, age ≥ 65, mean = 73.59, SD = 6.26) completed a 2-item questionnaire of subjective memory functioning, a brief computerized cognitive test, and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Participants were then assigned to one of four conditions based on their subjective (low/high) and objective (impaired/unimpaired) levels of cognitive functioning. Further analysis divided the sample into age-based groups (i.e. age < 75, age ≥ 75).

- **Results**: The proportion of participants in the impaired subsample (i.e. MoCA < 26) who reported a high level of subjective concern about their memory was low (i.e. 0.15). Among unimpaired participants, analysis detected significant group differences across subjective memory levels (P < .0003) and age (P < .005) categories on one of the three tasks of the computerized test (i.e. cognitive control). In contrast, the MoCA offered no differentiation between these groups.

- **Conclusion**: Screening protocols in which cognitive testing is administered subsequent to patient complaint are prone to underdiagnosis. Additionally, common dementia screens are insensitive to subjective deficits and healthy cognitive aging. Therefore, they may lead to dismissing valid concerns that deserve preventive attention. Primary care needs efficient screening tools that are sensitive to prodromal decline.

### My patient might be depressed - can I still screen for MCI? Exploring cognitive performance on the MoCA in older people screened for depressive symptoms with the PHQ-9 [^113qJXfH]. BMC Geriatrics (2025). Low credibility.

The **instruments** used in the study include the PHQ-9 and MoCA.

The **PHQ-9** is a short questionnaire consisting of nine items related to different depressive symptoms experienced over the past two weeks. Respondents can answer each item on a scale from 0 ("not at all") to 3 ("nearly every day"), resulting in a maximum possible total score of 27. Originally, to determine the severity of a depressive episode, several cut-offs were established: minimal (0–4), mild (5–9), moderate (10–14), moderately severe (15–19), and severe (20–27). However, a cut-off of ≥ 10 was identified as having the highest sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing between individuals with and without symptoms of a major depressive episode. Since cognitive impairments may already occur in individuals with a subsyndromal depressive episode, in accordance with Kroenke et al, the present study set the following cut-offs for depressive symptoms: "no–minimal" (0–4), "subclinical" (5–9), and "clinical" (≥ 10).

The **MoCA** is a screening tool with high sensitivity and specificity for differentiating between individuals with and without MCI. This instrument assesses multiple cognitive domains, including visuospatial and executive functioning, speech, attention, memory, and orientation. A total score of 30 can be achieved, with a score of ≤ 24 indicating MCI. It is unclear whether verbal fluency is part of the executive or language subscore. In the study by Nasreddine et al, verbal fluency was assigned to both subscores. However, in the MoCA, the task for verbal fluency is more of an assessment of…

### AriceptODT [^115EhiVc]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

The effectiveness of treatment with 23 mg/day was determined using a dual outcome assessment strategy that evaluated cognitive function, using an instrument designed for more impaired patients, and overall function through caregiver-rated assessment.

- **The Severe Impairment Battery (SIB)**: The ability of 23 mg/day to improve cognitive performance was assessed with the SIB. The SIB, a multi-item instrument, has been validated for the evaluation of cognitive function in patients with moderate to severe dementia. It evaluates selective aspects of cognitive performance, including elements of memory, language, orientation, attention, praxis, visuospatial ability, construction, and social interaction. The SIB scoring range is from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating greater cognitive impairment.

- **Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change (CIBIC-plus)**: The ability of 23 mg/day to produce an overall clinical effect was assessed using the CIBIC-plus, which incorporated caregiver information. This semi-structured instrument examines four major areas of patient function: general, cognitive, behavioral, and activities of daily living. It represents the assessment of a skilled clinician based on observations at an interview with the patient, combined with information supplied by a caregiver familiar with the patient's behavior over the rated interval. The CIBIC-plus is scored as a seven-point categorical rating, ranging from a score of 1, indicating "markedly improved", to 4, indicating "no improvement".

### Early postoperative neurocognitive complications in elderly patients: Comparing those with and without preexisting mild cognitive impairment- a prospective study [^1175E4bn]. BMC Geriatrics (2024). Low credibility.

Research assistants employed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test to evaluate patients' cognitive function. The test comprises several domains of a neurocognitive battery:

- **Visuospatial/executive**: Trail Making Test (1 point), Copy Cube (1 point), and Clock Drawing (3 points).
- **Naming**: (3 points).
- **Memory**: (no points).
- **Attention**: Digit Span (2 points), Vigilance (1 point), and Serial 7 Subtraction (3 points).
- **Language**: Sentence Repetition (2 points), and Verbal Fluency (1 point).
- **Abstraction**: (2 points).
- **Delayed recall**: (5 points).
- **Orientation**: (6 points).

The MoCA scores range between 0 and 30. All domains except memory are scored and summarized. The MoCA test has been identified as an especially apt tool for detecting mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a condition intermediate between intact cognition and dementia. Prior research has proposed an optimal MoCA score range of 18–24 for MCI detection, with scores ≥ 25 suggesting normal cognition. The MoCA test was applied preoperatively to determine baseline cognitive status and repeated between 5 and 9 days after surgery. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) was reported to present when there was a reduction of postoperative MoCA of ≥ 1 standard deviation (SD). According to the study conducted within the Thai population, an SD of MoCA was 2.14. Consequently, a reduction in the MoCA score of ≥ 2 from baseline indicated POCD.

### Concordance of the Montreal cognitive assessment with standard neuropsychological measures [^112P7m6c]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2015). Low credibility.

The concordance of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) with more comprehensive neuropsychological measures remains unclear. This study examined the individual MoCA domains in relation to more comprehensive and commonly used neuropsychological measures to determine the degree of overlap.

- **Methods**: Data included individuals seen in an outpatient neurology clinic specializing in neurodegenerative disease, who were administered the MoCA and also underwent neuropsychological assessment (n = 471). A principal component analysis with varimax rotation was completed using the MoCA domain scores and comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation measures.

- **Results**: Four factors emerged, accounting for 55.6% of the variance: (1) visuospatial/executive functioning; (2) memory; (3) attention; and (4) language. The individual MoCA domain scores demonstrated high factor loadings with standard neuropsychological measures purported to measure similar cognitive constructs.

- **Discussion**: These findings provide empirical validation for the MoCA domain classifications, lending further support for the use of the MoCA as a cognitive screen that reflects similar constructs as those measured by a comprehensive battery.

### Montreal cognitive assessment: Normative data for cognitively healthy Swedish 80- to 94-year-olds [^114BAZKQ]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Low credibility.

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a 13-item cognitive screening instrument assessing function in seven cognitive subdomains: visuospatial/executive, naming, attention, language, abstraction, delayed recall, and orientation. The test takes approximately 15 minutes to administer and yields a summed total score of a maximum of 30 points, with higher scores denoting better cognitive function. The present study used the official Swedish version published at MoCA - Cognitive Assessment (mocatest.org), administered and scored according to the manual. A standard procedure correction entails adding one point to the total score if the test taker has 12 or fewer years of education. Both raw scores and corrected scores were analyzed, but unless otherwise specifically stated, MoCA scores refer to raw scores.

- **Demographic factors**: Relevant diagnoses collected from medical records were coded as present or absent, and the number of diagnoses per participant was computed. Educational level was measured by the total number of years of formal education as stated by the participant. The Swedish version of the MMSE, MMSE-SR, was used in this study as a measure of global cognitive functioning to screen for cognitive impairment. It consists of 20 items assessing orientation to time and place, memory, attention, language, and visuospatial ability. The total score ranges from 0 to 30, with lower scores denoting more impaired cognition. Depressive symptoms were examined using the PHQ-9 self-rating scale of depression, a short version of the PHQ. Frequency of nine depressive symptoms over the past two weeks was reported together with a…

### Effect of a 12-mo intervention with whey protein powder on cognitive function in older adults with mild cognitive impairment: a randomized controlled trial [^112uzndv]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). High credibility.

Our previous animal study revealed that supplementation with milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) alleviated Alzheimer's disease pathology in mice. We hypothesized that supplementation with whey protein powder rich in MFGM, taurine, and B vitamins would improve cognitive function in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

- **Objectives**: We conducted a 12-month randomized controlled trial to investigate the effects of whey protein powder on cognitive function in older adults with MCI.

- **Methods**: Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the active intervention group (whey protein powder, 15 g/d) or the control group (placebo, 15 g/d). We performed comprehensive cognitive function tests at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. The primary outcome was global cognitive function determined by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Secondary outcomes included other cognitive subdomains and body composition. The data were analyzed using the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle.

- **Results**: A total of 107 participants [mean (standard deviation) age 62.94 (4.33) years] were randomly assigned to the active intervention group (n = 53), or control group (n = 54). In the ITT analysis, the mean change in MoCA score at 12 months was 3.23 [95% confidence interval (CI): 2.17, 4.30] in the active intervention group and 1.42 (95% CI: 0.36, 2.48) in the control group, with the mean difference between groups (group × time interaction) in change of MoCA score being 1.81 (95% CI: 0.32, 3.30). The modified ITT and per-protocol analyses showed similar results.

### Prospective comparison of the prognostic utility of the Mini Mental State Examination and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment in patients with brain metastases [^116UzN6q]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) is the most commonly chosen cognitive screening test (CST) in clinical practice and trials, despite its poor sensitivity, likely because of its prognostic utility. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is an alternative CST that is more sensitive and better correlated with quality of life.

Sixty-five patients with brain metastases were prospectively accrued and completed both the MMSE and MoCA. We compared the prognostic utility of both CSTs. The mean age of patients was 59.0 years, and 42.0% had single brain metastases. Median MMSE and MoCA scores were 28 and 22, respectively.

- **Results**: Median overall survival (OS) was worse for individuals with below-average versus above-average MMSE scores (10.4 versus 36.3 weeks, p = 0.007). Likewise, below-average versus above-average MoCA scores were prognostic (6.3 versus 50.0 weeks, p < 0.001). Moreover, survival times for MoCA scores < 18, 18 to 25, and > 26 were 6.3, 30.9, and 61.7 weeks, respectively (p < 0.001). On multivariable analysis, below-average MMSE scores were no longer prognostic (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.71 [0.90–3.26]), though below-average MoCA scores were (HR = 5.44 [2.70–10.94]). Furthermore, the MoCA demonstrated superior prognostic utility when comparing multivariable models with continuous CST scores.

Our results indicate that the MoCA is a superior prognostic indicator compared to the MMSE. Given its superior sensitivity and better correlation with quality of life, the MoCA should be preferentially chosen in clinical practice and trials.

### T-MoCA: A valid phone screen for cognitive impairment in diverse community samples [^111NU9Hd]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2021). Low credibility.

- **Cognitive classification**: In addition to the MoCA‐30, the in‐person clinic assessments included the Uniform Data Set Neuropsychological Battery (UDS), 47 additional neuropsychological measures (Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test [FCSRT], Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, Third Edition [WAIS III] Block Design, Wechsler Logical Memory I, and WAIS III Digit Symbol), 49 psychosocial measures, personal and family medical histories, demographics, indicators of activities of daily living, and self‐reports of cognitive concerns.

- **Dementia**: A diagnosis of dementia was an exclusion criterion for these analyses. During the initial telephone screen, the MIS telephone version was used to screen for severe cognitive impairment. Among those who passed the initial eligibility screen and who attended the in‐person clinic visit, dementia diagnosis was based on DSM‐IV standardized clinical criteria, which required impairment in memory and one other cognitive domain with evidence of functional decline. Diagnoses were assigned annually at consensus case conferences, where results of the neuropsychological and neurological examinations were reviewed along with relevant functional, social, and informant histories. Clinical judgment of cognitive decline, particularly with respect to pre‐morbid and baseline levels of cognition, age, and education, were routinely taken into account in making consensus diagnoses and in formal statistical analyses.

### Association between Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores and measures of functional mobility in lower extremity amputees after inpatient rehabilitation [^112GWCit]. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (2017). Low credibility.

To determine whether scores on a cognitive measure are associated with walking endurance and functional mobility of individuals with transfemoral or transtibial amputations at discharge from inpatient prosthetic rehabilitation, a retrospective cohort study was conducted at a rehabilitation hospital.

Consecutive admissions (N = 176; mean age ± SD, 64.27 ± 13.23 years) with transfemoral or transtibial amputation that had data at admission and discharge from an inpatient prosthetic rehabilitation program were included. Cognitive status was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). The L Test and the 2-minute walk test (2MWT) were used to estimate functional mobility and walking endurance.

The mean ± SD MoCA score was 24.05 ± 4.09 (range, 6–30), and 56.3% of patients had scores < 26. MoCA scores had a small positive correlation with the 2MWT (r = .29, p < 0.01) and a small negative correlation to the L Test (r = -.24, p < 0.01). In multivariable linear regression, compared with people with the highest MoCA score quartile, there was no difference on the 2MWT, but people in the lowest 2 quartiles took longer to complete the L Test.

Cognitive impairment was very prevalent. The association between MoCA and functional mobility was statistically significant. These results highlight the potential for differences on complex motor tasks for individuals with cognitive impairment but do not indicate a need to exclude them from rehabilitation on the basis of cognitive impairment alone.

### Tracking cognition with the T-MoCA in a racially/ethnically diverse older adult cohort [^114ezLbD]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2023). High credibility.

Participants' age at wave 1 ranged from 70 to 94 years (mean = 78.0, SD = 5.2). The sample was 65.3% female, with an average educational achievement of 15.0 ± 3.4 years. The racial/ethnic composition was 47% non-Hispanic White (NH-W), 39% non-Hispanic Black (NH-B), and 14% Hispanic. Among the 426 subjects at baseline, the average numbers of repeated measures were 1.8 for in-person MoCA-30 and 3.0 for the T-MoCA.

Baseline distributions among racial/ethnic groups showed significant differences in several categories:

- **Age distribution**: 78.6 ± 5.3 in NH-W, 78.0 ± 5.0 in NH-B, 76.1 ± 4.6 in Hispanic, p = 0.003
- **Percentage female**: 55% in NH-W, 76% in NH-B, 71% in Hispanic, p < 0.001
- **Years of education**: 15.9 ± 3.5 in NH-W, 14.3 ± 3.0 in NH-B, 14.0 ± 3.6 in Hispanic, p < 0.001
- **Score assessment**:
	- **T-MoCA scores**: 18.1 ± 2.8 in NH-W, 16.6 ± 2.6 in NH-B, 15.9 ± 2.9 in Hispanic, p < 0.001
	- **MoCA-22 scores**: 18.3 ± 2.7 in NH-W, 16.6 ± 2.9 in NH-B, 16.4 ± 2.6 in Hispanic, p < 0.001
	- **MoCA-30 scores**: 24.6 ± 3.5 in NH-W, 22.2 ± 3.6 in NH-B, 22.1 ± 3.2 in Hispanic, p < 0.001

There were no significant differences in GDS score and number of waves.

### Validation of the Chinese version of Montreal Cognitive Assessment Basic for screening mild cognitive impairment [^112ocQ9k]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2016). Low credibility.

To evaluate the effectiveness of the Chinese version of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Basic (MoCA-BC) as a screening tool for detecting mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in Chinese elderly adults, a cross-sectional study was conducted at Huashan Hospital in Shanghai, China. Participants included individuals with MCI (n = 264) and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) (n = 160) recruited from the Memory Clinic at Huashan Hospital, as well as cognitively normal controls from Jinshan Community, Shanghai (n = 280).

Measurements involved MoCA-BC scores. The MoCA-BC demonstrated good criterion-related validity, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.787 when compared to the MMSE, and reliable internal consistency, with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.807. The optimal cutoff scores for MCI screening were established as 19 for individuals with no more than 6 years of education, 22 for those with 7 to 12 years, and 24 for individuals with more than 12 years of education. The MoCA-BC was found to be superior to the MMSE for detecting MCI, offering optimal sensitivity and specificity across all education groups using these cutoff scores.

In conclusion, the MoCA-BC is a reliable cognitive screening test across all education levels in Chinese elderly adults, with high acceptance and good reliability.

### Utility of the MoCA for cognitive impairment screening in long-term psychosis patients [^11311naS]. Schizophrenia Research (2020). Low credibility.

Cognitive impairment is a key feature in patients with psychotic disorders. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a brief tool that has been shown to be effective in identifying mild cognitive impairment and early dementia. This study explores the usefulness of this instrument to detect cognitive impairment in long-term psychotic disorders. One hundred forty stabilized patients were re-evaluated more than 15 years following a First Episode of Psychosis (FEP). Patients were psychopathologically assessed, and the MoCA test and MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) were administered. Two cut-off scores for cognitive impairment using the MCCB were applied (T score < 40 and < 30).

Convalidation was found between the total scores of the MoCA and MCCB. We also found significant associations between 5 out of 7 MoCA subtests (visuospatial-executive, attention, language, abstraction, and delayed recall) and MCCB subtests, but not for the naming and orientation MoCA subtests. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis suggested a < 25 cut-off for cognitive impairment instead of the original < 26. Our results suggest that the MoCA test is a useful screening instrument for assessing cognitive impairment in psychotic patients and has some advantages over other available instruments, such as its ease of use and short administration time.

### Stability of Montreal cognitive assessment in individuals with mild cognitive impairment: Potential influence of practice effect [^113FVeSN]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2022). Low credibility.

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a standard test for screening and monitoring cognitive functions.

- **Objective**: This study explored the two-year changes in MoCA scores in older adults.

- **Methods**: Fifty-seven participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 87 participants with normal cognition completed the baseline and two-year follow-up assessments. Apart from MoCA, tests on visuospatial judgment, memory, and motor-related executive function were administered.

- **Results**: The results identified three MCI subgroups based on the differential changes in MoCA scores: consistently low, consistently high, and low-to-high between-time performances. These heterogeneous test performances are contrary to the significant deteriorations in executive function and finger dexterity across all subgroups. Repeated exposure to MoCA tests during the follow-up period was found to be a plausible indicator of the MCI subgroup categorization.

- **Conclusion**: Findings raise concerns over adopting brief clinical instruments for repeated testing, such as MoCA, for monitoring MCI conditions among older adults.

### Intravesical bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine affects cognition [^1121SYNF]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2024). Low credibility.

The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is a valuable assessment of the patient's awareness of time and place. We show that bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) significantly affects MoCA testing when administered by the intravesical route. MoCA scores were lower with increasing age and higher in more formally educated individuals. Patients receiving BCG tended to maintain their MoCA scores, whereas almost half the control cases tended to show reduced scores. This benefit is supported by reduced pre-amyloid biomarkers in BCG-injected healthy volunteers and a favorable effect on neuronal dendritic development in animal models. Our results suggest that BCG has a beneficial impact on the cognitive status of older individuals.

### Screening for mild cognitive impairment: Comparison of "MCI specific" screening instruments [^112HGjUZ]. Journal of Alzheimer's Disease (2016). Low credibility.

Sensitive and specific instruments are required to screen for cognitive impairment (CI) in busy clinical practice. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) is widely validated, but few studies compare it to tests designed specifically to detect mild cognitive impairment (MCI).

- **Objective**: Comparison of two "MCI specific" screens: the Quick Mild Cognitive Impairment screen (Qmci) and MoCA.

- **Methods**: Patients with subjective memory complaints (SMC; n = 73), MCI (n = 103), or dementia (n = 274) were referred to a university hospital memory clinic and underwent comprehensive assessment. Caregivers, without cognitive symptoms, were recruited as normal controls (n = 101).

- **Results**: The Qmci was more accurate than the MoCA in differentiating MCI from controls; area under the curve (AUC) of 0.90 versus 0.80, p = 0.009. The Qmci had greater (AUC 0.81), albeit non-significant, accuracy than the MoCA (AUC 0.73) in separating MCI from SMC, p = 0.09. At its recommended cut-off (< 62/100), the Qmci had a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 87% for CI (MCI/dementia). Raising the cut-off to < 65 optimized sensitivity (94%), reducing specificity (80%). At < 26/30 the MoCA had better sensitivity (96%) but poor specificity (58%). A MoCA cut-off of < 24 provided the optimal balance. Median Qmci administration time was 4.5 (± 1.3) minutes compared with 9.5 (± 2.8) for the MoCA.

- **Conclusions**: Although both tests distinguish MCI from dementia, the Qmci is particularly accurate in separating MCI from normal cognition and has shorter administration times, suggesting it is more useful in busy hospital clinics.

### Concordance of the Montreal cognitive assessment with standard neuropsychological measures [^114JTcHh]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2015). Low credibility.

The individual MoCA domain scores demonstrated high factor loadings with standard neuropsychological measures purported to measure similar cognitive constructs, providing empirical validation for the construct validity of the MoCA domain classifications. These findings lend further support for the use of the MoCA as a brief screen of cognition that reflects similar constructs as those gleaned from a more comprehensive battery. Most notably, the memory domain from the MoCA demonstrated a strong association with standard neuropsychological measures of memory and of the individual MoCA domain scores demonstrated the strongest loading. This is of particular relevance to practitioners working with neurodegenerative disease populations, as individuals demonstrating poor memory performance on the MoCA are likely to also demonstrate memory impairment on more comprehensive neuropsychological testing, validating the utility of the MoCA as a memory screening tool. What remains unclear is whether similar impairment profiles emerge on the MoCA as those on more standard neuropsychological measures (e.g. retrieval vs. encoding deficits), which could further aid in refining differential diagnoses; this reflects an empirical question of interest and target of future study.

A significant advantage of the MoCA over other cognitive screening measures is the breadth of cognitive domain coverage beyond memory, which increases its clinical utility, particularly for detection of individuals presenting with nonamnestic cognitive changes. As shown by the present findings, performance…

### Diagnosing Alzheimer's disease: Which dementia screening test to use in elderly Puerto Ricans with mild cognitive impairment and early Alzheimer's disease [^113TtuhE]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2024). High credibility.

Typically, Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis is not made at its earliest period, such as at mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early AD (E-AD). Our study aims to demonstrate a correlation between screening tools, including the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), and Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR), and the biological biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): amyloid beta 1–42 (Aβ42), phosphorylated tau (p-tau) proteins, and total tau (t-tau)/Aβ42 ratio in Puerto Ricans over 55 years old with MCI and E-AD.

We evaluated 30 participants, analyzing demographics, memory scales, and CSF biomarkers. Twenty-eight CSF biomarkers (Aβ42, p-tau protein, and t-tau/Aβ42 ratio) were analyzed using the Meso Scale Discovery Platform (MSD). Associations between memory scales (MoCA, MMSE, CDR) and CSF markers were performed using Spearman rho correlation.

Our study revealed a statistical association favoring a direct relationship between MMSE and MoCA with the t-tau/Aβ42 ratio in CSF (P = 0.022, P = 0.035, respectively). We found a trend toward significance with an inverse relationship with MMSE and Aβ42 (P = 0.069) and a direct relationship with MMSE and p-tau (P = 0.098). MMSE and MoCA screening tests were identified with a statistically significant association with the CSF biomarkers, specifically the t-tau/Aβ42 ratio, in elderly Puerto Ricans with MCI and E-AD. Puerto Ricans over 55 years old with MCI and E-AD could be screened confidently with MMSE and MoCA for a higher likelihood of earlier detection and, thus, initiation of disease-modifying treatment.
