## Question

Can naltrexone cause hepatotoxicity

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether naltrexone can cause hepatotoxicity. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the mechanistic plausibility and dose-response relationship. Then, I should verify what the FDA labeling and high-quality guidelines say about risk at therapeutic doses. Next, I will review clinical trial data, including meta-analyses and studies in patients with liver disease. After that, I need to check postmarketing and DILI registry signals. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation with monitoring and contraindications, making sure I reconcile any conflicting statements from different sources.

> Let me first confirm the mechanistic and dose-related risk signal. Naltrexone is hepatically metabolized and has documented hepatocellular injury at high doses, with the FDA noting a narrow margin between apparently safe doses and those causing hepatic injury, roughly fivefold or less, which explains why hepatotoxicity was observed in studies using 200–300 mg/day, far above the 50 mg/day therapeutic dose used for AUD and OUD [^117Gy1T5] [^114qR65T].

> Wait, let me verify how this translates to labeled therapeutic use. The FDA labeling for oral naltrexone states that outside of dose-related hepatotoxicity at very high doses, available evidence does not incriminate naltrexone at recommended doses as a cause of other serious adverse reactions in opioid-free individuals, which supports a dose-dependent hepatotoxicity profile rather than idiosyncratic injury at standard doses [^112zQdWJ].

> Next, I should review high-quality guideline syntheses. ASAM cautions that hepatotoxicity is a concern primarily at very high doses (for example, 200–300 mg/day) and advises baseline and periodic liver enzyme monitoring, with discontinuation if symptoms or signs of acute hepatitis occur; this aligns with a cautious but permissive stance at therapeutic doses in appropriate patients [^117CQfdo]. I should also confirm that major guidelines advise avoiding naltrexone in acute hepatitis or liver failure, which they do, reinforcing that severe active liver disease is a contraindication rather than a blanket prohibition in all liver disease [^111idaHM] [^11192Yys].

> I will now examine randomized trial safety data. A large systematic review and meta-analysis of 89 RCTs with 11,194 participants found no increase in serious adverse events with oral naltrexone versus placebo, supporting overall safety at therapeutic doses across diverse conditions, although individual studies variably captured liver-specific outcomes [^1115WhpP] [^113NnPCt]. In alcohol-dependent populations, extended-release naltrexone trials did not show clinically significant mean changes in AST/ALT over 24 weeks, further suggesting no overt hepatotoxic signal at 380 mg monthly dosing, although I should note that patients with marked baseline transaminase elevations were excluded from some studies [^113oGHQo] [^117BmwV7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions in patients with chronic liver disease. I need to check studies specifically in compensated cirrhosis and heavy drinkers. A randomized trial in adults experiencing homelessness with high daily alcohol consumption showed no difference in liver enzyme elevations between XR-NTX and placebo, supporting safety even in a high-risk, heavy-use population, albeit with careful baseline screening and monitoring [^1159iiVm]. Observational data also suggest that medical addiction therapy, including naltrexone, is associated with reduced hepatic decompensation in cirrhosis, though causality is not definitive and product labeling still advises caution in severe hepatic impairment [^112dbb9g] [^117Gy1T5].

> But wait, what about postmarketing and DILI signals. I should double-check DILI registries and case series. The DILIN prospective study identified only a single high-confidence naltrexone DILI case among 1,975 cases, and it was mild and self-limited, contrasting with frequent and sometimes severe disulfiram DILI, which helps calibrate absolute risk for naltrexone in real-world use [^113u2Yoi]. Overdose case reports likewise suggest that even very large single ingestions may not produce clinically significant liver injury, though this is low-quality evidence and should not be overinterpreted [^112Dt8eD].

> Let me consider special populations and formulations. For cholestatic pruritus, naltrexone is recommended as a third-line agent with slow titration and monitoring, reflecting that hepatotoxicity is uncommon but possible and that baseline liver disease is common in this group, so vigilance is prudent [^115RuMHf] [^113EEoo6]. For obesity, the naltrexone/bupropion combination carries a labeled hepatotoxicity warning, but this largely reflects the naltrexone component's known dose-related risk and the absence of dedicated hepatic impairment studies; in practice, dose limitations in moderate hepatic impairment are advised, and ALT improvements with weight loss have been observed in pooled analyses, which likely offset modest transaminase changes in many patients [^112VaXub] [^111F1wcY] [^114nYzsn].

> I should confirm monitoring recommendations and contraindications to synthesize a practical approach. Baseline liver enzymes are advised before starting naltrexone, with repeat testing at 6 and 12 months and annually thereafter in routine care, and more frequent checks if clinically indicated; avoid use in acute hepatitis or liver failure, and use caution with dose escalation or in patients with significant hepatic impairment, discontinuing if symptoms of hepatitis emerge or if ALT/AST rise to more than three times the upper limit of normal without an alternative explanation [^117AZ1U8] [^114xukme] [^11192Yys] [^113uicn2]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with FDA guidance; yes, the labeling advises warning patients about hepatic injury risk and discontinuing if acute hepatitis is suspected, which fits this monitoring and discontinuation framework [^113uicn2].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the bottom line is precise. Yes, naltrexone can cause hepatotoxicity, but the risk is dose-related and uncommon at therapeutic doses of 25–50 mg/day; clinically significant liver injury is rare at recommended dosing, whereas risk rises meaningfully at doses around 200–300 mg/day, explaining the historical boxed warning that was later removed for standard-dose oral therapy [^112zQdWJ]. In patients with compensated liver disease, emerging data and guidelines support that naltrexone can be used safely with appropriate monitoring, while acute hepatitis, liver failure, or marked transaminase elevations remain contraindications to initiation or continuation [^117LP6Ah] [^1159iiVm] [^111idaHM].

---

Naltrexone can cause hepatotoxicity, but the risk is **dose-related and low at therapeutic doses** (25–50 mg/day) [^117CQfdo]. Hepatotoxicity is rare at recommended doses, with most cases linked to **high doses (≥ 100 mg/day)** or prolonged use [^112zQdWJ] [^111wcJyy]. Clinically significant liver injury is uncommon, and routine liver function monitoring is advised, especially in patients with pre-existing liver disease or those on higher doses [^113u2Yoi] [^117CQfdo]. Naltrexone is contraindicated in acute hepatitis or liver failure, and should be discontinued if liver enzymes rise significantly [^111idaHM] [^11192Yys].

---

## Evidence of hepatotoxicity

### Clinical trials and observational studies

- **High-dose hepatotoxicity**: Clinical trials at doses of 100–300 mg/day showed hepatocellular injury, including elevated transaminases and jaundice, in a substantial proportion of patients [^112zQdWJ] [^117CQfdo].

- **Therapeutic-dose safety**: At 25–50 mg/day, hepatotoxicity is rare; most cases involve mild, transient transaminase elevations without clinical symptoms [^117CQfdo] [^113scjvV].

- **Meta-analysis findings**: A large meta-analysis of 89 RCTs (11,194 participants) found no increased risk of serious adverse events, including hepatotoxicity, with oral naltrexone versus placebo [^1115WhpP].

---

### Post-marketing surveillance

Post-marketing reports include **rare cases of hepatitis and clinically significant liver dysfunction**, often with confounders such as alcohol use, hepatitis B/C, or other hepatotoxins [^113uicn2] [^116834G8]. DILI data show that among medications for alcohol use disorder, **disulfiram accounts for most DILI cases**, whereas naltrexone-related DILI is rare and usually mild and self-limited [^113u2Yoi].

---

## Risk factors for hepatotoxicity

Several factors **increase the risk** of naltrexone-related hepatotoxicity:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Dose | Higher doses (≥ 100 mg/day) significantly increase risk [^notfound] |
| Duration | Prolonged use may increase risk, though data are limited [^notfound] |
| Pre-existing liver disease | Patients with chronic liver disease, hepatitis B/C, or alcohol-related liver disease have higher risk [^116pmLc8] |
| Concomitant medications | Other hepatotoxic drugs (e.g. acetaminophen, methotrexate) may increase risk [^113uicn2] [^1116SuCJ] |
| Genetic predisposition | Genetic factors may influence susceptibility, but evidence is limited [^notfound] |

---

## Clinical manifestations and laboratory findings

Naltrexone-induced hepatotoxicity typically presents with **elevated liver enzymes (ALT, AST)** and may include jaundice, fatigue, and abdominal pain [^113uicn2]. Severe cases can progress to hepatitis or liver failure, though this is rare at therapeutic doses [^117CQfdo].

---

## Monitoring and management

- **Baseline assessment**: Obtain liver function tests (ALT, AST, bilirubin) before starting therapy [^114xukme].

- **Routine monitoring**: Check liver enzymes periodically during treatment, especially in patients with liver disease or on higher doses [^117AZ1U8].

- **Discontinuation criteria**: Stop naltrexone if ALT/AST rise to > 3 times the upper limit of normal or if symptoms of hepatitis develop [^113uicn2] [^11192Yys].

- **Patient education**: Advise patients to report symptoms of liver injury (jaundice, dark urine, fatigue, abdominal pain) promptly [^1125jNfY].

---

## Comparison with other medications

Compared with other medications for alcohol use disorder, naltrexone has a **favorable hepatotoxicity profile**:

| **Medication** | **Hepatotoxicity risk** | **Notes** |
|-|-|-|
| Naltrexone | Low at therapeutic doses | Rare hepatotoxicity at 25–50 mg/day |
| Disulfiram | High | Significant risk of severe hepatotoxicity [^113u2Yoi] |
| Acamprosate | Minimal | No significant hepatotoxicity reported [^114FAhop] |

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize cautious use in patients with liver disease, recommending baseline and periodic liver function tests and avoidance in acute hepatitis or liver failure [^111idaHM] [^117CQfdo]. For compensated cirrhosis, **naltrexone may be used with caution and monitoring** [^117LP6Ah].

---

## Conclusion

Naltrexone can cause hepatotoxicity, but the risk is **low at therapeutic doses** and rises with higher doses or pre-existing liver disease. Routine liver function monitoring and patient education are essential to safe use, and naltrexone should be avoided in acute hepatitis or liver failure [^113uicn2] [^111idaHM].

Known safety issues for naltrexone

Naltrexone is contra-indicated in those currently using opioids due to the possibility of serious adverse events (SAEs) of either over-rapid opioid withdrawal or overdose of opioids, which can be life-threatening. These SAEs are of a different nature from those occurring in non-opioid users.

Concerns about naltrexone causing liver toxicity originated from several high-dose studies (up to 300 mg) in the 1980s. Because of these results, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) initially required a "black-box warning" about hepatotoxicity in the package insert for naltrexone; the FDA specifies such warnings to call attention to serious or life-threatening risks. However, because there are no known cases of hepatic failure due to naltrexone, the warning was eventually removed in 2013. The British National Formulary cautions avoidance in cases with acute hepatitis, hepatic failure or severe impairment, and in severe renal impairment. Known side effects include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, dizziness, lethargy, headaches and sleep disorders.

Drug safety in clinical trials

The quality of recording and reporting of harms in clinical trials has historically been less rigorous than that of efficacy. Progress has been aided by the introduction of standard definitions for adverse events (Box 1); the requirement to keep detailed records of adverse events (AEs) in clinical trials, introduced in 2001; the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors' endorsement of the reporting standards suggested in the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) extension for harms published in 2004, and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) harms checklist published in 2016; and the requirement to record outcomes, including AEs and SAEs, for RCTs registered on clinical trials registries since 2014 in the European Union (EU) and 2017 in the United States. An evidence synthesis of harms (SAEs and AEs) would help to yield a more accurate safety profile of naltrexone.

Hepatoxicity

Naltrexone has the capacity to cause hepatocellular injury when given in excessive doses.

Naltrexone is contraindicated in acute hepatitis or liver failure, and its use in patients with active liver disease must be carefully considered in light of its hepatotoxic effects.

The margin of separation between the apparently safe dose of naltrexone and the dose causing hepatic injury appears to be only five-fold or less. Naltrexone implants do not appear to be a hepatotoxin at the recommended doses.

Patients should be warned of the risk of hepatic injury and advised to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms of acute hepatitis. Use of Naltrexone implants should be discontinued in the event of symptoms and/or signs of acute hepatitis.

Implant Site Reactions

Infection and pellet extrusion are possible. Patients should be advised to avoid bath tubs and hot tubs, swimming, or exercise for 7 days after implantation to minimize extrusion risks. Infections must be reported to physicians and be treated with antibiotics.

Unintended Opiate Withdrawal

To prevent occurrence of an acute abstinence syndrome (withdrawal) in patients dependent on opioids, or exacerbation of a pre-existing subclinical abstinence syndrome, opioid-dependent patients, including those being treated for alcohol dependence, must be opioid-free for a minimum of 7–10 days before starting Naltrexone Implant treatment. Since the absence of an opioid drug in the urine is often not sufficient proof that a patient is opioid-free, a naloxone challenge test should be employed if the prescribing physician feels there is a risk of precipitating a withdrawal reaction following administration of Naltrexone Implants. Patients treated for alcohol dependence with Naltrexone Implants should be assessed for underlying opioid dependence and for any recent use of opioids prior to initiation of treatment with Naltrexone Implants. Precipitated opioid withdrawal has been observed in alcohol-dependent patients in circumstances where the prescriber had been unaware of the additional use of opioids or dependence on opioids.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

During two randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled 12-week trials to evaluate the efficacy of naltrexone hydrochloride as an adjunctive treatment of alcohol dependence, most patients tolerated naltrexone hydrochloride well. In these studies, a total of 93 patients received naltrexone hydrochloride at a dose of 50 mg once daily. Five of these patients discontinued naltrexone hydrochloride because of nausea. No serious adverse events were reported during these two trials.

While extensive clinical studies evaluating the use of naltrexone hydrochloride in detoxified, formerly opioid-dependent individuals failed to identify any single, serious untoward risk of naltrexone hydrochloride use, placebo-controlled studies employing up to five fold higher doses of naltrexone hydrochloride (up to 300 mg per day) than that recommended for use in opiate receptor blockade have shown that naltrexone hydrochloride causes hepatocellular injury in a substantial proportion of patients exposed at higher doses (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS, Laboratory Tests).

Aside from this finding, and the risk of precipitated opioid withdrawal, available evidence does not incriminate naltrexone hydrochloride, used at any dose, as a cause of any other serious adverse reaction for the patient who is "opioid-free". It is critical to recognize that naltrexone hydrochloride can precipitate or exacerbate abstinence signs and symptoms in any individual who is not completely free of exogenous opioids.

Patients with addictive disorders, especially opioid addiction, are at risk for multiple numerous adverse events and abnormal laboratory findings, including liver function abnormalities. Data from both controlled and observational studies suggest that these abnormalities, other than the dose-related hepatotoxicity described above, are not related to the use of naltrexone hydrochloride.

Among opioid-free individuals, naltrexone hydrochloride administration at the recommended dose has not been associated with a predictable profile of serious adverse or untoward events. However, as mentioned above, among individuals using opioids, naltrexone hydrochloride may cause serious withdrawal reactions (see CONTRAINDICATIONS, WARNINGS, DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Reported Adverse Events

Naltrexone hydrochloride has not been shown to cause significant increases in complaints in placebo-controlled trials in patients known to be free of opioids for more than 7 to 10 days. Studies in alcoholic populations and in volunteers in clinical pharmacology studies have suggested that a small fraction of patients may experience an opioid withdrawal-like symptom complex consisting of tearfulness, mild nausea, abdominal cramps, restlessness, bone or joint pain, myalgia, and nasal symptoms. This may represent the unmasking of occult opioid use, or it may represent symptoms attributable to naltrexone. A number of alternative dosing patterns have been recommended to try to reduce the frequency of these complaints.

Why is it important to do this review?

There have been several descriptive, non-systematic safety reviews of naltrexone recently, but none to date have concentrated on AEs and SAEs in clinical trials of naltrexone. Including studies from a wide range of conditions and concentrating only on a specific adverse outcome that has a regulatory definition should enable a large quantity of high-quality harms data to be collected. People with addictions are reluctant to take, and therapists to prescribe, one drug to overcome addiction to another drug, including alcohol, and practitioners remain concerned about the risk for liver toxicity with naltrexone. Hence, evidence about the safety of naltrexone is needed. Patients taking naltrexone and LDN may do so for prolonged periods of time; therefore, establishing the longer-term safety of naltrexone is particularly important. It may only be possible to discover increased or decreased rates of some SAEs, particularly cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events or cancers in meta-analyses, owing to their generally low background rates.

The primary aim of this review was to examine SAEs occurring in clinical trials of oral naltrexone, given for any condition apart from opioid or ex-opioid use, compared to placebo. Our focus on SAEs accords with the recent emphasis on understanding and preventing enduring or permanent patient harm (rather than examining every AE), as highlighted, for example, in the Dalton review of duty of candour. Further aims were to investigate possible confounders of risk of SAEs for naltrexone by subgroup analyses of disease group, dosage and length of study; to examine specific SAEs (deaths, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events and cancers); and to examine withdrawals and withdrawals due to AEs in the same clinical trials. A secondary aim was to examine AEs for naltrexone compared to placebo.

Hepatotoxicity

Cases of hepatitis and clinically significant liver dysfunction were observed in association with naltrexone hydrochloride exposure during the clinical development program and in the postmarketing period. Transient, asymptomatic hepatic transaminase elevations were also observed in the clinical trials and postmarketing period. When patients presented with elevated transaminases, there were often other potential causative or contributory etiologies identified, including pre-existing alcoholic liver disease, hepatitis B and/or C infection, and concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Although clinically significant liver dysfunction is not typically recognized as a manifestation of opioid withdrawal, opioid withdrawal that is precipitated abruptly may lead to systemic sequelae, including acute liver injury.

Patients should be warned of the risk of hepatic injury and advised to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms of acute hepatitis. Use of naltrexone hydrochloride should be discontinued in the event of symptoms and/or signs of acute hepatitis.

Depression and Suicidality

Depression, suicide, attempted suicide and suicidal ideation have been reported in the postmarketing experience with naltrexone hydrochloride used in the treatment of opioid dependence. No causal relationship has been demonstrated. In the literature, endogenous opioids have been theorized to contribute to a variety of conditions.

Alcohol- and opioid-dependent patients, including those taking naltrexone hydrochloride, should be monitored for the development of depression or suicidal thinking. Families and caregivers of patients being treated with naltrexone hydrochloride should be alerted to the need to monitor patients for the emergence of symptoms of depression or suicidality, and to report such symptoms to the patient's healthcare provider.

Ultra Rapid Opioid Withdrawal

Safe use of naltrexone in ultra rapid opiate detoxification programs has not been established (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

### Things we Do for No reason ™: avoiding naltrexone for alcohol use disorder in liver disease [^117KS9v7]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Hospitalizations related to alcohol use disorder (AUD) are common. Yet, few patients receive pharmacotherapy consistent with guideline recommendations. Previous concerns over the potential hepatotoxicity of naltrexone have been disproven and recent studies have shown its safety and efficacy in patients with cirrhosis. Naltrexone is an effective therapy to reduce heavy alcohol consumption, however, lack of knowledge among prescribers inhibits greater uptake. Hospitalization is an opportune time for change-naltrexone can promote the reduction or cessation of unhealthy alcohol consumption, as well as subsequent readmissions or progression of alcohol-related liver disease. Hospitalists should stop avoiding naltrexone in the treatment of AUD.

5.7 Hepatotoxicity

Cases of hepatitis and clinically significant liver dysfunction were observed in association with naltrexone exposure during naltrexone clinical trials and in postmarketing reports for patients using naltrexone. Transient, asymptomatic hepatic transaminase elevations were also observed. When patients presented with elevated transaminases, there were often other potential causative or contributory etiologies identified, including pre-existing alcoholic liver disease, hepatitis B and/or C infection, and concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Although clinically significant liver dysfunction is not typically recognized as a manifestation of opioid withdrawal, opioid withdrawal that is precipitated abruptly may lead to systemic sequelae, including acute liver injury.

Patients should be warned of the risk of hepatic injury and advised to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms of acute hepatitis. Use of CONTRAVE should be discontinued in the event of symptoms and/or signs of acute hepatitis.

In CONTRAVE clinical trials, there were no cases of elevated transaminases greater than three times the upper limit of normal (ULN) in conjunction with an increase in bilirubin greater than two times ULN.

5.8 Activation of Mania

Bupropion, a component of CONTRAVE, is a drug used for the treatment of depression. Antidepressant treatment can precipitate a manic, mixed, or hypomanic episode. The risk appears to be increased in patients with bipolar disorder or who have risk factors for bipolar disorder. Prior to initiating CONTRAVE, screen patients for a history of bipolar disorder and the presence of risk factors for bipolar disorder (e.g., family history of bipolar disorder, suicide, or depression). CONTRAVE is not approved for use in treating bipolar depression. No activation of mania or hypomania was reported in the clinical trials evaluating effects of CONTRAVE in obese patients; however, patients receiving antidepressant medications and patients with a history of bipolar disorder or recent hospitalization because of psychiatric illness were excluded from CONTRAVE clinical trials.

5.9 Angle-Closure Glaucoma

The pupillary dilation that occurs following use of many antidepressant drugs including bupropion, a component of CONTRAVE, may trigger an angle-closure attack in a patient with anatomically narrow angles who does not have a patent iridectomy.

Information for Patients

It is recommended that the prescribing physician relate the following information to patients being treated with naltrexone hydrochloride:

You have been prescribed naltrexone hydrochloride as part of the comprehensive treatment for your alcoholism or drug dependence. You should carry identification to alert medical personnel to the fact that you are taking naltrexone hydrochloride. A naltrexone hydrochloride medication card may be obtained from your physician and can be used for this purpose. Carrying the identification card should help to ensure that you can obtain adequate treatment in an emergency. If you require medical treatment, be sure to tell the treating physician that you are receiving naltrexone hydrochloride therapy. You should take naltrexone hydrochloride as directed by your physician.

Advise patients that if they previously used opioids, they may be more sensitive to lower doses of opioids and at risk of accidental overdose should they use opioids after naltrexone hydrochloride treatment is discontinued or temporarily interrupted. It is important that patients inform family members and the people closest to the patient of this increased sensitivity to opioids and the risk of overdose.
Advise patients that because naltrexone hydrochloride can block the effects of opioids, patients will not perceive any effect if they attempt to self-administer heroin or any other opioid drug in small doses while on naltrexone hydrochloride. Further, emphasize that administration of large doses of heroin or any other opioid to try to bypass the blockade and get high while on naltrexone hydrochloride may lead to serious injury, coma or death.
Patients on naltrexone hydrochloride may not experience the expected effects from opioid-containing analgesic, antidiarrheal, or antitussive medications.
Patients should be off all opioids, including opioid-containing medicines, for a minimum or 7 to 10 days before starting naltrexone hydrochloride in order to avoid precipitation of opioid withdrawal. Patients transitioning from buprenorphine or methadone may be vulnerable to precipitation of withdrawal symptoms for as long as two weeks. Ensure that patients understand that withdrawal precipitated by administration of an opioid antagonist may be severe enough to require hospitalization if they have not been opioid-free for an adequate period of time, and is different from the experience of spontaneous withdrawal that occurs with discontinuation of opioid in a dependent individual. Advise patients that they should not take naltrexone hydrochloride if they have symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Advise all patients, including those with alcohol dependence, that it is imperative to notify healthcare providers of any recent use of opioids or any history of opioid dependence before starting naltrexone hydrochloride to avoid precipitation of opioid withdrawal.
Advise patients that naltrexone hydrochloride may cause liver injury. Patients should immediately notify their physician if they develop symptoms and/or signs of liver disease.
Advise patients that they may experience depression while taking naltrexone hydrochloride. It is important that patients inform family members and the people closest to the patient that they are taking naltrexone hydrochloride and that they should call a doctor right way should they become depressed or experience symptoms of depression.
Advise patients that naltrexone hydrochloride has been shown to be effective only when used as part of a treatment program that includes counseling and support.
Advise patients that dizziness may occur with naltrexone hydrochloride treatment, and they should avoid driving or operating heavy machinery until they have determined how naltrexone hydrochloride affects them.
Advise patients to notify their physician if they:
become pregnant or intend to become pregnant during treatment with naltrexone hydrochloride.
are breastfeeding.
experience other unusual or significant side effects while on naltrexone hydrochloride therapy.

Naltrexone — drug interactions to consider before initiation: "Significant medication interactions to consider before starting naltrexone include the following:" "Naltrexone should not be used with methylnaltrexone or naloxegol". Because it is an opioid antagonist, "Naltrexone blocks the effects of opioid analgesics", and "Glyburide may increase serum concentration of naltrexone", warranting monitoring for increased toxicity effects such as liver enzyme elevations.

Naltrexone in OUD — perioperative management and safety notes that patients on naltrexone may not respond to opioid analgesics in the usual manner, and it is recommended that mild pain be treated with nonopioid analgesics and moderate to severe pain be treated with higher potency NSAIDs (e.g., ketorolac) on a short-term basis. Oral naltrexone should be discontinued 72 hours before surgery and extended-release injectable naltrexone should be discontinued 30 days before an anticipated surgery. Naltrexone's blockade of the mu-opioid receptor can often be overcome, when necessary, with high potency full agonist opioids, and in these instances patients should be closely monitored in an emergency department or hospital setting. After discontinuation of naltrexone therapy an increased susceptibility to overdose may occur, and physicians need to be vigilant and inform the patients of this increased risk of opioid sensitivity after using an opioid antagonist. There is a concern about a potentially higher overdose risk following discontinuation of XR-NTX due to loss of tolerance, and the medication guide for XR-NTX explicitly warns about this "rebound risk" of overdose but does not describe a particular period of risk. This risk may also be present for oral naltrexone, which is cleared from the system after just 24h and may leave patients with low opioid tolerance. Due to known hepatotoxicity in high doses, liver enzymes should be monitored before initiation and cautiously monitored throughout therapy; naltrexone is contraindicated in acute hepatitis or liver failure, and its use in patients with active liver disease must be carefully considered. The margin of separation between the apparently safe dose of naltrexone and the dose causing hepatic injury appears to be five-fold or less, VIVITROL does not appear to be a hepatotoxin at the recommended doses, and these warnings may not apply in low dose treatment with naltrexone specifically for neuropathic pain.

5.4 Hepatotoxicity

Cases of hepatitis and clinically significant liver dysfunction were observed in association with VIVITROL exposure during the clinical development program and in the postmarketing period. Transient, asymptomatic hepatic transaminase elevations were also observed in the clinical trials and postmarketing period. Although patients with clinically significant liver disease were not systematically studied, clinical trials did include patients with asymptomatic viral hepatitis infections. When patients presented with elevated transaminases, there were often other potential causative or contributory etiologies identified, including pre-existing alcoholic liver disease, hepatitis B and/or C infection, and concomitant usage of other potentially hepatotoxic drugs. Although clinically significant liver dysfunction is not typically recognized as a manifestation of opioid withdrawal, opioid withdrawal that is precipitated abruptly may lead to systemic sequelae including acute liver injury.

Patients should be warned of the risk of hepatic injury and advised to seek medical attention if they experience symptoms of acute hepatitis. Use of VIVITROL should be discontinued in the event of symptoms and/or signs of acute hepatitis.

Alternative Dosing Schedules

A flexible approach to a dosing regimen may need to be employed in cases of supervised administration. Thus, patients may receive 50 mg of naltrexone hydrochloride every weekday with a 100 mg dose on Saturday, 100 mg every other day, or 150 mg every third day. The degree of blockade produced by naltrexone hydrochloride may be reduced by these extended dosing intervals.

There may be a higher risk of hepatocellular injury with single doses above 50 mg, and use of higher doses and extended dosing intervals should balance the possible risks against the probable benefits (see WARNINGS).

Patient Compliance

Naltrexone hydrochloride tablets should be considered as only one of many factors determining the success of treatment. To achieve the best possible treatment outcome, appropriate compliance-enhancing techniques should be implemented for all components of the treatment program, including medication compliance.

### The need for integrating addiction medicine and hepatology [^111tZFmm]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Excessive alcohol use is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity. Among the medical consequences of unhealthy alcohol use, a cardinal one is ALD. Parallel to the increase in alcohol use and AUD, the rates of ALD continue to increase, especially among young people and women. The number of deaths with an underlying cause of ALD increased between 2019 and 2020, from 24 106 to 29 504 (relative change, 22.4%).

The treatment of AUD includes psychosocial and/or pharmacological interventions. Acamprosate, disulfiram, and naltrexone (oral and intramuscular), are approved by the FDA for AUD treatment, and a meta-analysis has found support for the effectiveness of naltrexone and acamprosate in patients with AUD. Furthermore, recent guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases highlight and recommend the use of acamprosate in patients with AUD and ALD. This endorsement is consistent with the lack of reported cases of hepatotoxicity in patients who were treated with acamprosate and with the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug given that acamprosate is not metabolized by the liver and is excreted unchanged by the kidneys.

Alcohol — management of unhealthy alcohol use in people with HIV: Ongoing alcohol use is not a contraindication for a person to receive antiretroviral therapy (ART), but treatment for unhealthy alcohol use may improve HIV treatment outcomes. Behavioral treatments for unhealthy alcohol use among people with HIV demonstrate a small but significant reduction in alcohol use. Pharmacotherapy also can reduce alcohol use among people with HIV, and the FDA has approved three pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorder (AUD): naltrexone, disulfiram, and acamprosate. Clinical trials have demonstrated the efficacy of naltrexone in reducing the number of heavy drinking days among those with HIV, naltrexone appears to be safe to use in people with HIV and is not associated with significant drug–drug interactions or irreversible hepatotoxicity, but it is not recommended for individuals with decompensated liver disease and should be used with caution in individuals with elevated transaminase levels. Use of naltrexone in people with HIV and AUD can improve HIV treatment outcomes.

Relapse-prevention agents in ALD — Disulfiram and naltrexone undergo hepatic metabolism and can cause liver damage, whereas acamprosate has no hepatic metabolism; none of these medications have been studied in patients with AH and AC. Several medications with some benefit in relapse prevention have not been FDA-approved for AUD treatment, including gabapentin, baclofen, topiramate, ondansetron, and varenicline. Based on limited data and without an RCT demonstrating efficacy, acamprosate does not appear to be toxic to the liver and is probably safe.

### Practical strategies for pruritus management in the obeticholic acid-treated patient with PBC: proceedings from the 2018 expert panel [^113XeBuJ]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

If bile acid sequestrants are inappropriate for a patient, or if they are insufficient in addressing the symptoms of pruritus, the recommended second-line treatment is rifampicin, a pregnane X receptor agonist. Rifampicin is associated with hepatotoxicity in some patients and should be initiated at a quarter dose and titrated slowly with careful monitoring of liver biochemistries. Rifampicin can be given at doses of 150–300 mg twice daily as tolerated; however, rifampicin should not be used in patients with bilirubin levels > 2.5 mg/dL. The recommended third-line treatment for pruritus is naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, which should also be initiated at a quarter dose and titrated up based on tolerability. Naltrexone should be initiated at a dose of 12.5 mg daily, and uptitrated every 3–7 days to reach the full dose of 50 mg per day. Although uncommon, there is a potential for naltrexone-related hepatotoxicity, and patient liver biochemistries should be monitored with naltrexone use. However, several experts on the panel expressed uncertainty about prescribing rifampicin and naltrexone due to potential side effects of liver toxicity. Although these medications are recommended by the clinical practice guidelines, they should be used with caution and with careful follow-up.

### Extended-release naltrexone is not linked to hepatotoxicity in adults experiencing homelessness and alcohol use disorder [^1159iiVm]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The use of extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) as treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD) has been limited by a prior black box warning for hepatotoxicity. We performed a secondary analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial to compare serum liver enzyme levels for those randomized to XR-NTX versus placebo.

Methods

The parent study aimed to test the efficacy of combined pharmacobehavioral harm-reduction treatment in improving alcohol and quality-of-life outcomes for adults experiencing homelessness and AUD. We compared the 2 arms that received intramuscular injections of either 380 mg XR-NTX (n = 74) or placebo (n = 77). Outcomes included (a) liver enzyme levels and (b) liver enzyme values categorized as normal (< 1× upper limit of normal [ULN]), elevated (1–3× ULN), or high (> 3× ULN). We performed multinomial logistic regression and negative binomial generalized estimating equations modeling to assess the effects of treatment group and the time × treatment group interaction on liver enzyme outcomes.

Results

The mean age was 47.9 ± 9.9 years, and the mean baseline alcohol consumption was 23.2 ± 14.0 drinks per day. There were no significant differences in the development of liver enzyme elevations 1 to 3× ULN or more than 3× ULN (all P s > 0.25) or in the change in liver enzyme values (all P s > 0.41) between the placebo and the XR-NTX groups over the treatment course.

Conclusions

In our study of adults experiencing homelessness and AUD, receipt of XR-NTX was not associated with hepatotoxicity. These findings support the use of XR-NTX to treat AUD even in patients who are drinking heavily and physiologically dependent on alcohol.

Laboratory Tests

Hepatic Enzymes

In short-term, controlled trials, in alcohol-dependent patients, the incidence of AST elevations associated with Naltrexone Injection treatment was similar to that observed with oral naltrexone treatment (1.5% each) and slightly higher than observed with placebo treatment (0.9%).

In the 6-month controlled trial conducted in opioid dependent subjects, 89% had a baseline diagnosis of hepatitis C infection, and 41% had a baseline diagnosis of HIV infection. There were frequently observed elevated liver enzyme levels (ALT, AST, and GGT); these were more commonly reported as adverse events in the naltrexone injection 380 mg group than in the placebo group. Patients could not enroll in this trial if they had a baseline ALT or AST value that was more than three times the upper limit of normal. More patients treated with naltrexone injection in this study experienced treatment-emergent elevations in transaminases to more than three times the upper limit of normal than patients treated with placebo. Shifts to more than three times the upper limit of normal occurred in 20% of patients treated with naltrexone injection as compared with 13% of placebo patients. Shifts in values of AST to more than three times the upper limit were also more common in the naltrexone injection (14%) arm compared with the placebo (11%) arm.

Opioid-dependent patients treated with naltrexone injection experienced a mean maximal increase from baseline ALT levels of 61 IU/L compared with 48 IU/L in placebo patients. Similarly for AST, opioid-dependent patients treated with naltrexone injection experienced a mean maximal increase from baseline AST levels of 40 IU/L compared with 31 IU/L in placebo patients.

### Clinical safety of 1500 mg oral naltrexone overdose [^112Dt8eD]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Medium credibility.

This case represents a clinical overdose of the largest known dose of oral naltrexone, equivalent to the taking of a whole bottle of the oral naltrexone preparation. The patient's intention was to control craving for alcohol and opiates. The patient quickly settled with expectant management. As such it demonstrates that earlier concerns that have been voiced in this area, particularly relating to naltrexone-related hepatotoxicity and depression, may have been overstated, at least in the experience of this patient. This patient's course was marked only by gastric irritation, of which she had some history. As such the present profile provides case report evidence consistent with more robust views of the patient safety of naltrexone itself, and opposing more cautious views. Her polydrug craving was suppressed for a period of 2 weeks, which raises the important question of the mechanism of action of naltrexone's generalised suppression of refractory hedonic consumptive addictive behaviours.

### Weak evidence on nalmefene creates dilemmas for clinicians and poses questions for regulators and researchers [^111dcnYm]. Addiction (2016). Low credibility.

Investigators on the Lundbeck trials refer to the 'different biochemical profile' of nalmefene and naltrexone 57; however, differences in in‐vitro receptor actions cannot be assumed to be clinically important 58. Although naltrexone is associated with a risk of hepatotoxicity at very high doses (> 300 mg/day), it is considered 'very unlikely' with doses of 25–50 mg per day (52, p. 417); the risk is so low that routine liver function test monitoring is not recommended 52. Thus, the clinical significance of any difference between the two drugs is unclear. The Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Healthcare (the German equivalent of NICE) concluded that any added benefit of nalmefene over naltrexone is unproven 59. The lack of comparative effectiveness data prevented the NICE ERG from commenting on the relative cost‐effectiveness of nalmefene and naltrexone 24. Even if naltrexone plus psychosocial support is not widely used, as the NICE appraisal committee was informed (15, p. 27), naltrexone is a very similar, much cheaper drug. There is also good evidence for acamprosate 60, 61 and accumulating evidence for topiramate, both also generic drugs 62.

No data are available on the adequacy of the psychosocial intervention 'BRENDA' 40 used in both arms in the Lundbeck trials. NICE guidelines 52 recommend more intensive psychosocial support over 12 weekly sessions (of cognitive–behavioural therapy, for example) in harmful drinking and mild dependence before pharmacotherapy is considered. A more intensive psychosocial intervention than BRENDA would also therefore seem an appropriate comparator, and there is a range of possible uses and combinations of medication and psychosocial interventions that could merit evaluation within more patient‐centred approaches to care 63. The NICE ERG reported that 'it believes it probable that delayed [nalmefene] treatment reserved for those who do not respond' to this optimal support 'is more cost‐effective than immediate treatment for all patients' (24, p. 118). The one published clinical trial which used a more strongly evidence‐based psychosocial intervention (motivational enhancement therapy) found no added benefit of nalmefene 33.

Opiate antagonists for cholestatic pruritus — naltrexone, nalmefene, and naloxone — were evaluated in a meta-analysis including five trials with a reported total of 84 participants and were significantly more likely to decrease pruritus compared with placebo; patients may experience an opiate withdrawal-like reaction, so the dosage should be gradually introduced, for example starting naltrexone at 12.5 mg daily and increasing by 12.5 mg every 3 to 7 days until pruritus is ameliorated, with an alternative of hospital intravenous infusions of naloxone followed by conversion to oral naltrexone, and drug-induced liver injury from naltrexone is uncommon but possible, so follow-up of liver biochemistries is recommended.

Relapse prevention medications in alcoholic liver disease — dosing, mechanisms, and ALD considerations are summarized as follows: Naltrexone is dosed 50 mg/d orally or 380 mg monthly sq, is an opioid receptor antagonist, is not studied in patients with ALD, and has hepatotoxicity concerns. Acamprosate is dosed 666 mg tid, is an NMDA receptor antagonist, is not studied in patients with ALD, and has no reported instances of hepatotoxicity. Gabapentin is dosed 600–1,800 mg/d, has E: Renal 75%, fecal 25%, modulates GABA activity through action at presynaptic calcium channels, is not studied in patients with ALD, and requires monitoring for renal dysfunction and worsening mental status/sedation. Baclofen is dosed 30–60 mg/d, is a GABA-B receptor agonist, and a single RCT in patients with ALD showed benefit. Topiramate is dosed 75–400 mg/d, is not extensively metabolized, and is not studied in patients with ALD. The table notes that disulfiram is not recommended for use in patients with ALD.

Methods

The review followed the Cochrane Handbook for guidance throughout and the PRISMA harms extension. The protocol was registered on the PROSPERO website in January 2017, registration number CRD42017054421. This can be accessed at.

Selection criteria

Any parallel-designed RCT longer than 4 weeks, in participants of any age and for any condition, in which oral naltrexone was compared to placebo was included. Studies in which opioid or ex-opioid use was specified in the protocol were excluded owing to the possibility of opioid/opioid antagonist interactions occurring. Only studies published after 1 January 2001 were included, owing to the widespread introduction of regulations requiring the recording of AEs and reporting of SAEs in RCTs from that year.

Outcomes

The primary outcome measure was the number of participants with an SAE recorded in the naltrexone arm compared to the placebo arm. The investigator's judgement as to whether an SAE had occurred and any causality was followed, as suggested by the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) (Box 1). Where no definition was given, the definition(s) from the detailed guidance CT-3 for the EU and by the FDA for the United States as summarised in Box 1 was used to support our judgement. The secondary outcome was the type of AEs reported in either treatment arm.

Search methods for identifying studies

The following electronic databases were searched: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed MEDLINE, EMBASE (via OVID), Web of Science Core Collection, PsycINFO (via OVID) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts via OVID (Additional file 1). There were no language restrictions. No terms for AE or side effects were included to avoid over-restrictive selection of studies with the potential risk of outcome reporting bias. The final date of searches was May 2018.

Further sources were relevant systematic reviews containing clinical trials of naltrexone, and journal articles being assessed for inclusion in this review. The World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry, the US clinical trials registry, and the European Union Clinical Trials Registry EudraCT were searched using the word "naltrexone". These are good sources of unpublished but completed clinical trials. Where a study appeared unpublished, the lead investigator was contacted to confirm this was so. Ongoing studies were recorded, to enable future updating of this systematic review. Grey literature was included in the review from clinical trial registries, conference abstracts listed within CENTRAL, regulatory submissions to the US FDA for drug licences and unpublished studies located from previous systematic reviews.

### Serious adverse events reported in placebo randomised controlled trials of oral naltrexone: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114cr2Jn]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

The ICH differentiates seriousness, as defined above, from severity, which relates to the intensity of an event. AEs may be severe but relatively minor, for example, a severe headache. Regulations, and this systematic review, are only concerned with serious events.

ADR: Adverse drug reaction. All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product related to any dose.

Side effect: Negative (unfavourable) or positive (favourable) effects of a drug.

In randomised controlled trials, such definitions are best avoided as they require an assessment of causal link between an AE and the drug and hence could result in biased data collection.

### Serious adverse events reported in placebo randomised controlled trials of oral naltrexone: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1143nMwq]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Box 1 Definitions of harms connected to the use of drugs in clinical trials

The International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) developed definitions for use in clinical trials which were then incorporated into EU and US law. The ICH (1994) gave the following definitions:

AE: Adverse event. An AE is defined as "Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical trial subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product".

SAE: Serious adverse event. An SAE is defined as "Any untoward medical occurrence or effect that at any dose results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation, results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity, or is a congenital anomaly or birth defect".

These characteristics/consequences have to be considered at the time of the event. For example, regarding a life-threatening event, this refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe.

Some medical events may jeopardise the subject or may require an intervention to prevent one of the above characteristics/consequences. Such events (hereinafter referred to as 'important medical events') should also be considered as 'serious' in accordance with the definition. (US regulations state "… and may require… " rather than "… or may require… ").

The regulations state that "the judgement as to whether the event is serious is usually made by the reporting investigator" and that "the assessment of whether there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship is usually made by the investigator". In this systematic review all judgements on seriousness and causality by study authors were therefore accepted.

Patients who were initially too intoxicated to consent for study participation were reassessed for sobriety and ability to consent by the CRC throughout the course of their ED stay. Patients displaying symptoms of alcohol withdrawal were treated according to a standardized ED protocol and were offered admission to a medically managed detoxification program or hospital, depending on the severity of their withdrawal symptoms. Patients with a history of withdrawal who did not wish to undergo medically managed detoxification but were still interested in reducing their alcohol intake were eligible for study participation.

Patients were excluded from study participation if they (1) had a history of self‐reported opioid use disorder or scored greater than zero on the DAST‐10 where the primary drug reported was an opioid, (2) had a present or anticipated need for opioid medications for pain, (3) were being admitted for alcohol detoxification or other medical and/psychiatric reasons, (4) were too intoxicated to consent, or (5) were pregnant or breastfeeding. Patients were also excluded if they had cirrhosis by past medical history or self‐report because FDA labeling of oral naltrexone indicates that hepatic impairment can significantly alter naltrexone bioavailability and dose‐related hepatotoxicity.

### ACG clinical guideline: primary sclerosing cholangitis [^113m1C23]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Medium credibility.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis — pruritus management states that "The management of pruritus should be directed to the underlying cause of cholestasis. In PSC, therapeutic intervention for patients with a dominant stricture should be considered". Symptomatic care includes "Mild pruritus may be treated with skin emollients and possibly antihistamines", and "More severe pruritus is best managed by bile acid sequestrants, such as cholestyramine", with "A total daily dose of cholestyramine of 4–16 g is needed to maintain symptom control (124)". Second-line options are specified: "Second-line therapies include rifampin, at a dose of 150–300 mg twice daily (liver tests and serum bilirubin should be monitored during rifampin therapy to evaluate for hepatotoxicity), naltrexone (up to 50 mg/day), sertraline (75–100 mg per day) or phenobarbital (90 mg at bedtime) (125,126)".

Laboratory Tests

Naltrexone hydrochloride does not interfere with thin-layer, gas-liquid, and high pressure liquid chromatographic methods which may be used for the separation and detection of morphine, methadone or quinine in the urine. Naltrexone hydrochloride may or may not interfere with enzymatic methods for the detection of opioids depending on the specificity of the test. Please consult the test manufacturer for specific details.

Drug Interactions

Studies to evaluate possible interactions between naltrexone hydrochloride and drugs other than opiates have not been performed. Consequently, caution is advised if the concomitant administration of naltrexone hydrochloride and other drugs is required.

The safety and efficacy of concomitant use of naltrexone hydrochloride and disulfiram is unknown, and the concomitant use of two potentially hepatotoxic medications is not ordinarily recommended unless the probable benefits outweigh the known risks.

Lethargy and somnolence have been reported following doses of naltrexone hydrochloride and thioridazine.

Patients taking naltrexone hydrochloride may not benefit from opioid containing medicines, such as cough and cold preparations, antidiarrheal preparations, and opioid analgesics. In an emergency situation when opioid analgesia must be administered to a patient receiving naltrexone hydrochloride, the amount of opioid required may be greater than usual, and the resulting respiratory depression may be deeper and more prolonged (see PRECAUTIONS).

### Drug-induced liver injury due to medications for alcohol use disorder: results from the DILIN prospective study [^113u2Yoi]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Concerns about drug-induced liver injury (DILI) may deter physicians from prescribing medications for alcohol use disorder (MAUD). We aim to explore DILI due to MAUD in Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) prospective study.

Methods

High-confidence DILI cases (ie, definite, highly likely, or probable) due to MAUD in DILIN prospective study (2004–2024) were included. Demographic, clinical, laboratory data, and 6-month outcomes were analyzed. HLA allele frequency (AF) of disulfiram cases was compared to matched controls with DILI due to non-MAUD (DILI controls).

Results

Among 1975 high-confidence cases, 13 were attributed to MAUD (11 disulfiram; 1 naltrexone and 1 baclofen; and none from acamprosate). Median age was 45years, with 77% female and 85% White. All had hepatocellular injury. In disulfiram group, the median time for DILI occurrence was 34days. Eight patients developed jaundice, with 3 fatal or near-fatal cases (2 liver transplantation and 1 liver-related death). Five (71%) patients with severe or fatal disulfiram DILI had underlying liver disease. AF for HLA-C✱01:02 (OR, 6.29; P = 0.02) and DRB1✱09:01 (OR, 10.16; P = 0.02) were significantly higher in disulfiram cases than in DILI controls. DILI from baclofen and naltrexone was mild and self-limited with no chronic DILI.

Conclusions

Disulfiram is the leading cause of DILI among MAUD and is most common in women. Disulfiram can cause severe DILI and is associated with HLA-C✱01:02 and DRB1✱09:01. Baclofen and naltrexone can cause mild to moderate self-limited DILI. There were no cases of acamprosate. These findings suggest DILI due to MAUD are less frequent.

### British society of gastroenterology best practice guidance: outpatient management of cirrhosis-part 1: compensated cirrhosis [^116pmLc8]. Frontline Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Alcohol

Patients with cirrhosis should be routinely asked about alcohol intake as part of their clinical review. It is recommended that patients with cirrhosis from any cause should abstain from alcohol. Abstinence is a critical goal for people with ARLD, since it improves outcomes at all stages of disease.

Pharmacotherapy for relapse prevention should be considered for people with ARLD in combination with psychosocial/behavioural interventions. NICE recommends use of disulfiram, naltrexone or acamprosate to manage AUDs following successful alcohol withdrawal. However, none of these medications have specifically been studied in patients with cirrhosis. Disulfiram and naltrexone undergo hepatic metabolism, increasing the risk of hepatotoxicity in those with hepatic dysfunction — they are therefore not recommended by the European Association for the Study of the Liver for use in patients with cirrhosis. Acamprosate does not undergo hepatic metabolism, and based on limited data, is probably safe in Child-Pugh A and B cirrhosis. To date, baclofen is the only pharmacotherapy for AUD for which there are RCT data in people with cirrhosis; a single RCT demonstrated the safety and efficacy of baclofen in promoting alcohol abstinence in patients with ARLD and cirrhosis (including decompensated disease, but excluding patients with hepatic encephalopathy), but confirmatory studies are warranted as subsequent study results have been conflicting. The role of baclofen in the management of AUD is currently being evaluated in a further RCT.

Those who continue to drink alcohol, in a harmful or dependent pattern, are at risk of developing alcohol-related brain damage, in part due to thiamine deficiency. Prophylactic parenteral thiamine followed by oral thiamine (100 mg two times per day) should be given to those at risk who attend an emergency department or are admitted to hospital with an acute illness, including decompensated chronic liver disease.

People diagnosed with ongoing alcohol misuse or alcohol dependence (indicators of which include alcohol-withdrawal symptoms including seizures and the need for medically assisted withdrawal/detoxification) must be advised not to drive until after 6 (alcohol misuse) to 12 (alcohol dependence) months of controlled drinking or abstinence, and to notify the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. This advice extends to those with any chronic cognitive impairment due to alcohol and those diagnosed with hepatic encephalopathy due to any cause of cirrhosis (see guidelines on decompensated cirrhosis).

### Opioid therapies and cytochrome p450 interactions [^1126i3Yj]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2012). Low credibility.

Adverse drug reactions are common and associated with substantial economic and human costs. Particularly among older adult populations, preventable adverse drug reactions are often caused by drug-drug interactions. All analgesics have side effect profiles and many have known drug-drug interactions. Opioids are recognized as a necessary option for managing moderate-to-severe pain, yet many opioid side effects can be enhanced by metabolic interactions within the liver, involving other drugs, diseases, or genetics.

### Incidence and progression of alcohol-associated liver disease after medical therapy for alcohol use disorder [^112dbb9g]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

We found that patients exposed to acamprosate had a higher likelihood of developing ALD. Acamprosate is widely prescribed to patients with AUD and liver disease given its favorable liver safety profile. However, compliance with acamprosate may be lower than with other medical addiction therapy medications because of its complex and frequent dosing regimen. In the present study, although noncompliance with acamprosate may diminish its potential benefit for the patient population, noncompliance alone would not explain its observed association with increased risk for ALD. It is possible that, given the favorable hepatotoxic profile of acamprosate, it is prescribed to patients who are deemed more likely to develop liver disease or have evidence of mild hepatic injury from alcohol. Furthermore, in our practice, acamprosate is reserved for use in patients with more severe AUD. Consistent with this explanation, more patients who received acamprosate had a diagnosis of severe AUD (defined as having both ICD-10 diagnosis codes for conditions termed as alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence), compared with patients who received any other medication for AUD. Although the preponderance of evidence suggests that acamprosate may be beneficial for patients with AUD, a recent study found potential harm. A randomized clinical trial is needed to further elucidate this association between acamprosate and ALD development in well-matched patients with AUD.

In addition, we found that patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis were less likely to experience a hepatic decompensating event if exposed to medical addiction therapy, even when such treatment was initiated only after their index cirrhosis diagnosis. This result is consistent with findings from previous studies of medical addiction therapy in patients with liver disease. Rogal and colleaguesfound that veterans with cirrhosis who were treated with FDA-approved medical addiction therapy had a 40% reduction in hepatic decompensation at 6 months. Similarly, Mellinger et alfound reduced odds of hepatic decompensation at 1 year in patients with cirrhosis who received FDA-approved medical addiction therapy medications. Naltrexone is currently contraindicated in severe liver diseasegiven the concern for hepatotoxicity and the precipitation of liver failure in these vulnerable patients. The results of this study suggest a benefit of naltrexone: it is a factor in not only preventing ALD but also limiting hepatic decompensation in patients with established cirrhosis. The data that support the risk of hepatotoxicity and liver failure in patients receiving naltrexone are limited. Accordingly, further studies examining the benefits and risks of naltrexone for the treatment of AUD in patients with ALD are needed.

### Are recommended doses of acetaminophen hepatotoxic for recently abstinent alcoholics? A randomized trial [^114AUbTd]. Clinical Toxicology (2008). Low credibility.

Although acetaminophen overdose is a leading cause of fulminant hepatic failure, it is controversial whether therapeutic doses of acetaminophen can cause hepatotoxicity in alcoholics, especially those rendered most vulnerable by recent abstinence. We performed a randomized, triple-blind, parallel-group trial comparing sustained-release acetaminophen, 1300 mg orally q8h for 11 doses, against placebo. We enrolled chronic alcohol abusers (defined as ≥ 6 drinks daily for ≥ 6 weeks) who had discontinued alcohol consumption 12 to 72 hours prior to enrollment. Individuals with self-reported viral hepatitis, HIV or intravenous drug use, baseline AST or ALT > 120 IU/L, or INR > 1.5 were excluded. Hepatic function tests were drawn daily for 5 days. The primary outcome was change in serum alpha-GST, a sensitive experimental biomarker of hepatocellular injury; secondary outcomes were changes in serum AST, ALT, INR, and study withdrawal for a doubling of aminotransferases to > 120 IU/L. Of 52 subjects randomized, 40 completed at least four days of intervention. Subjects receiving acetaminophen had 32% [95% CI 7%, 50%] and 29% [6%, 46%] lower serum alpha-GST concentrations on days 2 and 3, respectively, compared to placebo, but these differences disappeared by day 4. No subjects were withdrawn for safety reasons. In conclusion, therapeutic doses of sustained-release acetaminophen cause a measurable decrease in serum alpha-GST during the first days of abstinence from chronic alcohol use. While the mechanism is unclear, these observations do provide some reassurance that short courses of acetaminophen are unlikely to cause subclinical hepatocellular injury in recently abstinent alcoholics.

### Serious adverse events reported in placebo randomised controlled trials of oral naltrexone: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114Hrf6j]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Implications for researchers, clinicians and policy makers

The results of this review are supportive of the wider use of naltrexone and have the realistic potential to impact on clinical guidelines. Policy makers (e.g. US Preventative Task Force and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence) are encouraged to use the findings of this review in conjunction with other studies focussed on benefits and cost-effectiveness of naltrexone to draw/revise evidence-based recommendations regarding the licensed use of naltrexone in a broader range of conditions. Treatment of AUDs, for which naltrexone is currently under-utilised, is a key area of consideration. Estimates suggest that about 58% of alcohol-dependent people in England want to reduce their drinking. The increased use of pharmacotherapy for AUDs has been shown to be cost-effective and could reduce deaths.

This review shows the advantages of examining both benefit and risk profiles for drugs and the need for consistent and adequate recording of AEs and SAEs in reports of RCTs. Recent studies included in this review still did not consistently report harms to the standard suggested in the CONSORT extension for harms, and differences in judgements on what constituted an SAE were evident between studies. Research on the efficacy of naltrexone for most diseases apart from AUDs and opioid abuse is currently lacking; naltrexone would seem an excellent candidate for repurposing given it is both safe and cheap, being long out of patent. It is also possible that naltrexone could be associated with changes in the rates of cancers and cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events given the complex interactions of opioids in the body. Thus, both large-scale pragmatic clinical trials of potentially new indications for naltrexone, and systematic evaluations through pharmaco-epidemiological studies using long-term safety data (e.g. the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink are needed.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^117ST9XK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Hepatic and Renal Impairment

Naltrexone appears to have extra-hepatic sites of drug metabolism and its major metabolite undergoes active tubular secretion (see Metabolism above). Adequate studies of naltrexone in patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment have not been conducted (see PRECAUTIONS, Special Risk Patients).

Alcoholism

The efficacy of naltrexone hydrochloride as an aid to the treatment of alcoholism was tested in placebo-controlled, outpatient, double blind trials. These studies used a dose of naltrexone hydrochloride 50 mg once daily for 12 weeks as an adjunct to social and psychotherapeutic methods when given under conditions that enhanced patient compliance. Patients with psychosis, dementia, and secondary psychiatric diagnoses were excluded from these studies.

In one of these studies, 104 alcohol-dependent patients were randomized to receive either naltrexone hydrochloride 50 mg once daily or placebo. In this study, naltrexone hydrochloride proved superior to placebo in measures of drinking including abstention rates (51% vs. 23%), number of drinking days, and relapse (31% vs. 60%). In a second study with 82 alcohol-dependent patients, the group of patients receiving naltrexone hydrochloride were shown to have lower relapse rates (21% vs. 41%), less alcohol craving, and fewer drinking days compared with patients who received placebo, but these results depended on the specific analysis used.

The clinical use of naltrexone hydrochloride as adjunctive pharmacotherapy for the treatment of alcoholism was also evaluated in a multicenter safety study. This study of 865 individuals with alcoholism included patients with comorbid psychiatric conditions, concomitant medications, polysubstance abuse and HIV disease. Results of this study demonstrated that the side effect profile of naltrexone hydrochloride appears to be similar in both alcoholic and opioid dependent populations, and that serious side effects are uncommon.

In the clinical studies, treatment with naltrexone supported abstinence, prevented relapse and decreased alcohol consumption. In the uncontrolled study, the patterns of abstinence and relapse were similar to those observed in the controlled studies. Naltrexone hydrochloride was not uniformly helpful to all patients, and the expected effect of the drug is a modest improvement in the outcome of conventional treatment.

Risk of relapse and subsequent opioid overdose is emphasized: patients maintained on naltrexone may have diminished tolerance and may be unaware of increased sensitivity if they stop taking naltrexone; patients who discontinue antagonist therapy should be made aware, because if they stop naltrexone and resume use at doses not reflecting lost tolerance there is risk of opioid overdose, with a similar dynamic after withdrawal management without meaningful follow-up or after dropping out of methadone or buprenorphine treatment.

### Efficacy and safety of oral naltrexone treatment for pruritus of cholestasis, a crossover, double blind, placebo-controlled study [^112xWJza]. Journal of Hepatology (2002). Low credibility.

Background/Aims

To assess the efficacy and safety of naltrexone for the short and long term treatment of pruritus of cholestasis.

Methods

Twenty patients with pruritus and cholestasis were included. A baseline pruritus score was obtained over 1 week. Patients were then randomized to receive 50 mg/day of naltrexone or placebo for 2 weeks. Subsequently, a 1-week washout period ensued and patients were crossed over to the other therapy for 2 additional weeks. Pruritus was assessed daily with a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 to 10. Patients whose pruritus decreased > 50% of basal with naltrexone received naltrexone 50 mg/day for 2 additional months.

Results

Mean basal VAS was similar in both groups. VAS showed greater and more significant changes with naltrexone than with placebo (P < 0.0003). In nine out of 20 patients (45%) receiving naltrexone, pruritus decreased > 50% compared to basal value, including five whose pruritus disappeared completely. No significant changes were observed in serum biochemistry. Most of the adverse events that occurred during the first 48 h of naltrexone therapy were consistent with opioid withdrawal-like phenomena and spontaneously disappeared 2 days after starting treatment.

Conclusions

Naltrexone can be considered as an alternative option to treat pruritus of cholestasis. In the current study, side effects were transient and did not require specific medication.

### Naltrexone (Vivitrol) [^112nWACy]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

8.2 Lactation

Risk Summary

Naltrexone and its major metabolite, 6β-naltrexol, are present in human milk. There are no data on the effects on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. The developmental health benefits of breastfeeding should be considered along with the mother's clinical need for naltrexone and any potential adverse effects on the breastfed infant from naltrexone or the mother's underlying maternal condition.

8.4 Pediatric Use

The safety and efficacy of VIVITROL have not been established in the pediatric population. The pharmacokinetics of VIVITROL have not been evaluated in a pediatric population.

8.5 Geriatric Use

In trials of alcohol-dependent subjects, 2.6% (n = 26) of subjects were > 65 years of age, and one patient was > 75 years of age. Clinical studies of VIVITROL did not include sufficient numbers of subjects age 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. No subjects over age 65 were included in studies of opioid-dependent subjects. The pharmacokinetics of VIVITROL have not been evaluated in the geriatric population.

This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, it may be useful to monitor renal function.

8.6 Renal Impairment

Pharmacokinetics of VIVITROL are not altered in subjects with mild renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance of 50–80 mL/min). Dose adjustment is not required in patients with mild renal impairment. VIVITROL pharmacokinetics have not been evaluated in subjects with moderate and severe renal insufficiency. Because naltrexone and its primary metabolite are excreted primarily in the urine, caution is recommended in administering VIVITROL to patients with moderate to severe renal impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

8.7 Hepatic Impairment

The pharmacokinetics of VIVITROL are not altered in subjects with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Groups A and B of the Child-Pugh classification). Dose adjustment is not required in subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. VIVITROL pharmacokinetics were not evaluated in subjects with severe hepatic impairment [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Emergency department-initiated oral naltrexone for patients with moderate to severe alcohol use disorder: a pilot feasibility study [^116ZsSN3]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

As found in other studies of oral naltrexone, we did not identify any safety concerns in participants taking oral naltrexone nor is there any reason to believe ED patients differ in any physiological way to patients receiving oral naltrexone in other settings that could increase risk. While our study is too small to identify rare safety events, we did not identify any serious adverse events related to oral naltrexone and participant‐reported side effects tended to be mild. Of note, one patient was withdrawn from the study due to elevated LFTs. While recent literature has challenged the warnings of oral naltrexone in patients with significant liver disease, we chose to be conservative and exclude those with aspartate transaminase and alanine aminotransferase elevations 5× normal.

Other measured secondary outcomes are more challenging to interpret. The population's baseline health care utilization was low and did not change over the study period. This was unexpected given the fact that patients with AUD have high rates of ED visits and admissions. Participant‐reported responses to the baseline stigma questionnaire are interesting and warrant further study. Their relatively high self‐perceived stigma toward people with AUD could impact their engagement in follow‐up care as previously demonstrated in large epidemiological studies. A strong association between self‐perceived stigma and engagement in care could indicate a need to integrate sigma reducing interventions into ED‐based care for patients with AUD.

Regarding the significance of this feasibility study, it is valuable to first characterize the current landscape of ED‐initiated AUD medical therapy. Despite the increasing rate of AUD among ED patients, less than 15% of EDs have formal screening and intervention policies in place for AUD. The reported barriers to implementing ED‐initiated naltrexone programs include factors such as high staff turnover, insufficient training, and high patient acuity, though there are resources available for mitigating these challenges. Regarding the viability of our screening protocol, 62% of our patients found the screening to not be difficult, 67% found it to be convenient, and 74% were satisfied with the screening. Given the available resources for training ED staff and the subjective patient assessment of the screening as convenient, there is potential for more EDs to implement similar approaches. Regarding the long‐term benefits of such training, one study saw that staff training increased naltrexone prescription rates from 0.66% to 3.96% among patients with AUD over 2 years. As a whole, both our study and those described show the potential viability of ED‐initiated naltrexone, but significant gaps in our understanding of the implementation barriers remain and must be addressed by further study.

### Injectable extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) for opioid dependence: long-term safety and effectiveness [^1127G2xi]. Addiction (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

To describe drug use and safety with intramuscular injectable extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) in opioid dependence during a 1-year open-label extension phase.

Design

Following 6 months of randomized, double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled injections given every 28 days, patients receiving XR-NTX 380mg continued and PBO patients were switched to open-label XR-NTX, with monthly individual drug counseling, for a further year.

Setting

Thirteen clinical sites in Russia.

Participants

Adult opioid-dependent outpatients.

Measurements

Monthly urine samples; reports of craving and functioning; adverse events.

Findings

For the open-label extension (n = 114), 67 continued on XR-NTX and 47 switched from PBO during the double-blind phase to XR-NTX during the open-label phase. Overall, 62.3% (95% CI: 52.7%, 71.2%) completed the extension. Discontinuation occurred most commonly because of withdrawal of consent (18.4%) and loss to follow-up (11.4%); two patients discontinued as a result of lack of efficacy and one because of adverse events. Urine testing revealed that 50.9% (41.5%, 60.4%) were abstinent from opioids at all assessments during the 1-year open-label phase. Adverse events reported by 21.1% of patients were judged to be study drug-related. Injection site reactions were infrequent (6.1%) and the majority were mild. Elevations in liver function tests occurred for 16.7% of patients, but none of these elevations was judged to be clinically significant. No patients died, overdosed or discontinued as a result of severe adverse events.

Conclusions

During a 1-year open-label extension phase of injectable XR-NTX for the prevention of relapse in opioid dependence, 62.3% of patients completed the phase and 50.9% were abstinent from opioids. No new safety concerns were evident.

### Naltrexone for cholestatic itch: a systematic review [^116canvz]. BMJ Supportive & Palliative Care (2021). High credibility.

Background

Cholestatic itch is caused by intrahepatic liver diseases, such as primary biliary cirrhosis and extrahepatic obstruction of the biliary tree, often caused by tumours. The pathophysiology of cholestatic itch is complex and no single treatment has proved definitive. Naltrexone is an opioid receptor antagonist, which reduces central opioidergic tone, believed to be raised in patients with cholestatic pruritus.

Aim

To review and assess the efficacy of oral naltrexone for the treatment of cholestatic itch.

Methods

Search of electronic databases, grey literature, clinical trials registries and handsearching for studies including naltrexone for cholestatic itch. Full papers were obtained if relevant and studies graded.

Results

Thirteen papers were included in the analysis, including three randomised controlled trials, one controlled clinical trial, one open-label pilot study, seven case reports and one retrospective notes review. All studies found naltrexone to be effective in relieving pruritus. In all five studies performing statistical analysis, naltrexone significantly reduced pruritus compared with baseline. 37% of patients reported side effects, notably opioid withdrawal-type reactions and recurrence of previous pain, from all pathologies.

Conclusions

Oral naltrexone therapy helps relieve cholestatic itch and although it should be used with caution in patients using exogenous opioids for analgesia, it should be considered when treating refractory pruritus in patients with end-stage liver disease.

### Removal of opioid / acetaminophen combination prescription pain medications: assessing the evidence for hepatotoxicity and consequences of removal of these medications [^116FuZRU]. Pain Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Opioid/acetaminophen combination products are widely prescribed for the management of moderate to moderately severe pain. Acetaminophen, when improperly used, can lead to liver damage and even acute liver failure. In June 2009, an FDA advisory committee recommended elimination of prescription acetaminophen combination products because of the risk of hepatotoxicity associated with use of these medications. The FDA advisory committee reviewed numerous observational studies and adverse event reporting data. The aims of this article are to: 1) provide a summary and epidemiologic critique of the studies and evidence the FDA advisory committee reviewed; 2) examine the potential consequences, such as poorly managed pain or a shift to treatment with other medications with greater potential toxicity and/or restricted availability, if the FDA follows the advisory committee vote; and 3) outline alternate strategies the FDA should consider for reducing hepatotoxicity associated with opioid/acetaminophen combination products.

### Incidence and progression of alcohol-associated liver disease after medical therapy for alcohol use disorder [^1158qdPy]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) is among the most common and devastating complications of excessive alcohol use. Alcohol-associated liver disease represents a wide spectrum, ranging from the relatively benign hepatic steatosis to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The most aggressive form of ALD is severe alcohol-associated hepatitis, which has a 30% 3-month mortality rate. A surge in the incidence of ALD is expected with the COVID-19–related increase in alcohol use. It is, therefore, critical to prevent the development of ALD to limit the morbidity and mortality associated with excessive alcohol use.

Some medical treatments for alcohol use disorder (AUD) exist. Disulfiram, acamprosate, and naltrexone are 3 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved medical addiction therapy medications for AUD that have been associated with improved rates of abstinence, reduced binge drinking, and decreased rate of AUD-related hospitalizations. Furthermore, in patients with AUD, gabapentin and topiramate have been associated with a decreased number of days of heavy drinking, whereas baclofen has shown promise as a factor in achieving abstinence.

Data are limited on the use of medical addiction therapy for AUD in patients with ALD. Baclofen has been the most well examined in this context, with multiple studies showing its favorable safety profile and potential benefit in patients with ALD. More recent studies found that patients with cirrhosis who received FDA-approved therapies for AUD were less likely to experience hepatic decompensation over a 6- to 12-month period.

Despite these intriguing findings, certain questions remain. First, does medical addiction therapy play a role in preventing the development of ALD in patients with AUD? Second, do off-label medications for medical addiction therapy (gabapentin, topiramate, and baclofen) provide a benefit for patients with ALD-associated cirrhosis? Third, is there a long-term benefit (> 1 year) with regard to protection against hepatic decompensation in patients with cirrhosis receiving medical addiction therapy?

In this study, we leveraged a well-characterized cohort of patients with AUD who had long-term follow-up data to ascertain whether medical addiction therapy was associated with an altered risk of developing ALD. In addition, we sought to ascertain whether medical addiction therapy was associated with reduced risk of hepatic decompensation in patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis. We analyzed both FDA-approved and off-label pharmacotherapy for AUD.

### Serious adverse events reported in placebo randomised controlled trials of oral naltrexone: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115E9xZE]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Prevalence and nature of serious adverse events

In events ascribed to a particular study arm, naltrexone or placebo, a total of 315 SAEs were recorded among 260 participants. The number of participants having at least one SAE was 119 in the naltrexone arms and 141 in the placebo arms. Among the 315 SAEs, nine deaths were reported, three in the naltrexone arms and six in the placebo arms. Although examining the nature and causality of SAEs was beyond the scope of this study, wherever such data were provided, they were extracted. Our descriptive review of these limited data suggested that there were no differences between the two treatment arms in terms of the nature of SAEs. Among the included studies, AEs were reported across 20 independent comparisons. A total of 7,017 AEs (involving 188 MedDRA preferred-term events) were identified: 3,938 in the naltrexone arm and 3,079 in the placebo arm (Additional file 5: Table S3). All AEs were reported as being mild-moderate in nature.

Results

Trial flow: flow diagram and numbers

The electronic searches identified 7873 citations, and a further 995 records identified from clinical trials websites (821), systematic reviews (157) and references in other papers (17). Deleting duplicate references reduced this to 4738 records, of which 4390 were excluded on the basis of examining the abstracts. Full-text articles were obtained for 348 citations. From these, 96 citations were excluded and 163 were subsidiary papers. Thus, 89 primary studies were identified (Additional file 2). The numbers identified at each stage through from initial searching to quantitative analyses, and the reasons for excluding studies, are given in a PRISMA 2009 flow diagram (Fig. 1).

Characteristics of included studies

Eighty-nine studies (11,194 participants) were found that fulfilled the review criteria, including publication after 1 January 2001. Three studies were excluded because they only gave total participant numbers, leaving 86 studies (10,957 participants) from which data could potentially be extracted for analysis. Table 1 summarises the characteristics of included studies by broad categories, while Additional file 3: Table S1 provides the details of each study. The target dose of naltrexone varied from 3 mg to 250 mg. The most frequent conditions were AUDs (36 studies). In a further 21 studies, including studies of HIV infection, psychiatric disorders, addictions and smoking, participants had a dual diagnosis including AUDs. Other studies were of various psychiatric disorders, impulse control disorders, other addictions, obesity, Crohn's disease, fibromyalgia and cancers. The patient groups in many of the studies tended to have complex problems, multi-morbidity, present or past multiple addictions or illnesses and to be taking multiple drugs as well as the trial drugs.

### Serious adverse events reported in placebo randomised controlled trials of oral naltrexone: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1165Xdk1]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

This review was limited to studies of oral naltrexone, excluding studies involving current or prior opioid addiction or use. Our assessment of SAEs by disease group should only be considered as exploratory because classifying the populations into specific disease groups was not clear-cut owing to the predominance of AUDs even in studies of other disorders.

While the primary aim of this study was to examine SAE data from RCTs, we did examine AEs in a secondary analysis, but this analysis was based on limited data identified in the journal publication and the registry report. Previous evidence has also shown that the assessment and reporting of AEs is often inconsistent and incomplete across the studies. For example, a large safety review of 44 studies of naltrexone for AUDs found that AEs were often not collected using standardised measures, that the methods for systematically capturing AEs were often not reported, and the reporting of AEs was highly selective.

Recording of AEs can be hampered by the presence of nocebo (harmful) effects (i.e. worsening symptoms during placebo treatment), which can vary disease by disease. Particularly in alcohol and drug addiction, placebo and nocebo mechanisms could impact on the therapeutic outcomes and side effects of treatments. Although less likely in the recording of SAEs owing to their seriousness, this may have also impacted our results.

Finally, a few refinements to the protocol were necessary, but these occurred as recommended before any data collection occurred. The main change was the exclusion of laboratory-based studies, studies of less than 4 weeks duration and cross-over studies from the review. The initial scoping exercise had not revealed the large numbers of such studies and attempting an analysis of all these would have exceeded available resources.

Comparison with the existing literature

To our knowledge, this is the first large systematic review of SAEs in people taking naltrexone, excluding only those people taking opioids. Two large previous systematic reviews of naltrexone in AUDs were conducted by Rösner et al. for the Cochrane Collaboration and Jonas et al. for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Both examined AEs, but in fewer studies. Rösner et al. analysed nine studies including two using injectable naltrexone, and calculated the RD of experiencing SAEs as −0.02 (95% CI −0.05–0.00). By using a wider range of studies and inclusion criteria and limiting the publication dates after the 1 st of January 2001, this review was able to provide a more accurate assessment of the risk of SAEs than any previous review.

### The British society of gastroenterology / UK-PBC primary biliary cholangitis treatment and management guidelines [^112SP6KN]. Gut (2018). Low credibility.

Rifampicin is a useful second-line agent probably acting through its pregnane X receptor (PXR) agonist function. Several prospective randomised placebo-controlled trials have shown rifampicin to be effective in the management of cholestatic pruritus. This effect has been confirmed in meta-analyses. There are concerns over potential side effects with rifampicin (including hepatotoxicity and haemolysis), so patients commenced on treatment need regular blood tests. It is also important to remember that rifampicin affects vitamin K metabolism and can lead to an increase in the international normalised ratio (INR), most notably in icteric patients. Additionally, appropriate consideration should be given to balancing benefits against risks of antimicrobial resistance.

Opiate antagonists (oral naltrexone and parenteral naloxone) are increasingly used as third-line therapy as they reduce the sensation of itching and scratching activity. Naltrexone should be started at a low dose to avoid opiate withdrawal-like reactions in the first few days of treatment. Long-term tolerability can be an issue, with many patients having ongoing opiate withdrawal-like reactions or reduced threshold to pain.

Other drugs which are used empirically in the management of cholestatic itch, typically in patients with pruritus unresponsive to other agents, are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; eg, sertraline) and gabapentin. SSRIs presumably act via altering the concentrations of neurotransmitters within the central nervous system. There are some reports of efficacy in the literature, but only a single small placebo-controlled trial. Side effects of SSRIs include dry mouth and patients should be warned about this. Gabapentin has been suggested as a potential treatment due to the theoretical benefit of increasing the threshold to experience nociception. However, a small trial failed to show benefit over placebo. Further evaluation of gabapentin may be warranted given the clinical experience. Antihistamines sometimes have a non-speciﬁc anti-pruritic effect which may be due to their sedative properties but are not recommended as specific therapy; they are, however, useful adjuncts for some. Table 2 shows an approach to the treatment of cholestatic pruritus.

### Extended-release naltrexone / bupropion and liver health: pooled, post hoc analysis from four randomized controlled trials [^111F1wcY]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Sustained weight loss improves liver histology in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. This post hoc analysis of four phase III, 56-week, randomized controlled trials investigated if extended-release naltrexone and bupropion (NB) affects alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index in adults with overweight or obesity. Two thousand and seventy-three subjects (NB = 1310; placebo = 763; 79.0% female; 81.6% Caucasian) had baseline mean weight 101kg, body mass index 36.2 kg/m 2, ALT 26.9 IU/L and FIB-4 0.79. At 56weeks, NB-treated subjects experienced more weight loss than placebo (8.7 vs. 3.2kg, respectively, P < .0001). Weight loss, independent of treatment, was associated with improved ALT and FIB-4 (P < .0001). There was a significant independent effect of NB on change from baseline for FIB-4 (P < .0001), but not for ALT (P = 0.54). Categorical ALT response (from above to within normal ranges: 10–40IU/L for men; 7–35IU/L for women) and achievement of 25% and 50% reduction in ALT were greater for NB versus placebo, and independently affected by weight loss (P < .0001), but not treatment. NB-associated weight loss may improve liver health by normalizing ALT values for those with high baseline levels.

### Circumstances of death of opioid users being treated with naltrexone [^114ckh97]. Addiction (2019). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist used as a maintenance drug for the treatment of opioid dependence and in opioid withdrawal regimens. The current study aimed to: (1) determine the clinical characteristics and circumstances of death of people undergoing naltrexone treatment for opioid dependence; and (2) determine the blood toxicology of cases including naltrexone concentrations, the presence of other drugs and a comparison of morphine concentrations in the presence and absence of naltrexone.

Design

Retrospective study of all deaths among people undergoing naltrexone treatment for opioid dependence retrieved from the National Coronial Information System, 2000–17.

Setting

Australia-wide.

Cases

Seventy-four cases, with a mean age of 32.5 years; 81.1% male.

Measurements

Information was collected on demographics, manner of death, naltrexone treatment history, toxicology and major organ pathology.

Findings

Death was attributed to opioid toxicity in 86.5% of cases: accidental (79.7%), deliberate (6.8%). In 55.4% of all cases the decedent was maintained on oral naltrexone and 32.4% had a recent naltrexone implant. In five cases the decedent was undergoing opioid detoxification. Among those screened for naltrexone, naltrexone was present in the blood or urine of 52.5% (15.8% of oral maintenance cases, 85.7% of implant cases). Fourteen cases were known to have died from opioid toxicity with naltrexone present in their blood or urine. The median blood naltrexone concentrations were within the reported therapeutic range.

Conclusions

The primary cause of death among people undergoing naltrexone treatment for opioid dependence in Australia from 2000 to 2017 was opioid toxicity, the majority of cases having been maintained on oral naltrexone. Cases in which naltrexone was not detected indicate the importance of treatment compliance. Deaths due to opioid toxicity where naltrexone was present indicates the possibility of overdose while naltrexone medication is maintained.

### Serious adverse events reported in placebo randomised controlled trials of oral naltrexone: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1115WhpP]. BMC Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist used in many different conditions, both licensed and unlicensed. It is used at widely varying doses from 3 to 250 mg. The aim of this review was to extensively evaluate the safety of oral naltrexone by examining the risk of serious adverse events and adverse events in randomised controlled trials of naltrexone compared to placebo.

Methods

A systematic search of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, Embase, other databases and clinical trials registries was undertaken up to May 2018. Parallel placebo-controlled randomised controlled trials longer than 4 weeks published after 1 January 2001 of oral naltrexone at any dose were selected. Any condition or age group was included, excluding only studies in opioid or ex-opioid users owing to possible opioid/opioid antagonist interactions. The systematic review used the guidance of the Cochrane Handbook and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses harms checklist throughout. Numerical data were independently extracted by two people and cross-checked. Risk of bias was assessed with the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. Meta-analyses were performed in R using random effects models throughout.

Results

Eighty-nine randomised controlled trials with 11,194 participants were found, studying alcohol use disorders (n = 38), various psychiatric disorders (n = 13), impulse control disorders (n = 9), other addictions including smoking (n = 18), obesity or eating disorders (n = 6), Crohn's disease (n = 2), fibromyalgia (n = 1) and cancers (n = 2). Twenty-six studies (4,960 participants) recorded serious adverse events occurring by arm of study. There was no evidence of increased risk of serious adverse events for naltrexone compared to placebo (risk ratio 0.84, 95% confidence interval 0.66–1.06). Sensitivity analyses pooling risk differences supported this conclusion (risk difference −0.01, 95% confidence interval −0.02–0.00) and subgroup analyses showed that results were consistent across different doses and disease groups. Secondary analysis revealed only six marginally significant adverse events for naltrexone compared to placebo, which were of mild severity.

Conclusions

Naltrexone does not appear to increase the risk of serious adverse events over placebo. These findings confirm the safety of oral naltrexone when used in licensed indications and encourage investments to undertake efficacy studies in unlicensed indications.

### Alcohol use disorder medication coverage and utilization management in medicaid managed care plans [^112QPV3d]. JAMA Network Open (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is an underrecognized, significant public health issue with adverse effects on individuals and society. An estimated 28.1 million adults in the US have AUD, which is associated with substantial morbidity, including increased rates of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and injuries. Alcohol-related deaths increased 70% from 2012 to 2022, with sharp increases observed during the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 178 000 individuals in the US died in 2020 and 2021 from excessive alcohol use, a 23% increase from 2016 and 2017. An estimated 1 in 5 deaths among people aged 20 to 49 years are attributable to alcohol. Furthermore, alcohol-related morbidity and mortality are increasing rapidly among Black and Hispanic individuals, women, and people living in rural areas of the US.

Evidence-based treatments for AUD include behavioral therapies and medications. The 4 US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)–approved medications for AUD (MAUD), acamprosate, disulfiram, and naltrexone (oral and extended-release injectable), are safe, relatively inexpensive, and cost-effective. Oral naltrexone and acamprosate have the strongest evidence for AUD treatment and are recommended by the American Psychiatric Association as first-line treatments for moderate to severe AUD. Naltrexone may help with reducing heavy drinking and cravingand has been associated with reduced progression of alcohol-related liver disease. Acamprosate is associated with maintenance of abstinence from alcohol. Disulfiram may be less effective than other MAUD but can help decrease the likelihood of relapse among individuals adherent to the medication regimen; American Psychiatric Association clinical guidelines recommend disulfiram for patients with a goal of abstinence from alcohol. MAUD regimens differ based on route of administration (oral or injectable), dosing schedules, contraindications, adverse effect profiles, and the individual's ability to initiate medication while still drinking alcohol. Given these differences, true patient-centered care requires access to the range of medications. These medications are relatively low cost (< $50 for a 1-month supply), with the exception of injectable naltrexone, which is not available as generic (> $1000 per monthly injection). Despite clinical guideline recommendations, among the estimated 28.1 million adults identified in a community sample as meeting criteria for having AUD, less than 3% received MAUD in 2023 and less than 2% of Black and Hispanic individuals with AUD received MAUD.

### Opioid antagonists for alcohol dependence [^112ap8yK]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Alcohol dependence belongs to the globally leading health risk factors. Therapeutic success of psychosocial programs for relapse prevention is moderate and could be increased by an adjuvant treatment with the opioid antagonists naltrexone and nalmefene.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and tolerability of opioid antagonists in the treatment of alcohol dependence.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group (CDAG) Specialized Register, PubMed, EMBASE and CINAHL in January 2010 and inquired manufacturers and researchers for unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

All double-blind randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which compare the effects of naltrexone or nalmefene with placebo or active control on drinking-related outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted outcome data. Trial quality was assessed by one author and cross-checked by a second author.

Main Results

Based on a total of 50 RCTs with 7793 patients, naltrexone reduced the risk of heavy drinking to 83% of the risk in the placebo group RR 0.83 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.90) and decreased drinking days by about 4%, MD -3.89 (95% CI -5.75 to -2.04). Significant effects were also demonstrated for the secondary outcomes of the review including heavy drinking days, MD - 3.25 (95% CI -5.51 to -0.99), consumed amount of alcohol, MD - 10.83 (95% CI -19.69 to -1.97) and gamma-glutamyltransferase, MD - 10.37 (95% CI -18.99 to -1.75), while effects on return to any drinking, RR 0.96 (95 CI 0.92 to 1.00) missed statistical significance. Side effects of naltrexone were mainly gastrointestinal problems (e.g. nausea: RD 0.10; 95% CI 0.07 to 0.13) and sedative effects (e.g. daytime sleepiness: RD 0.09; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.14). Based on a limited study sample, effects of injectable naltrexone and nalmefene missed statistical significance. Effects of industry-sponsored studies, RR 0.90 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.05) did not significantly differ from those of non-profit funded trials, RR 0.84 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.91) and the linear regression test did not indicate publication bias (P = 0.765).

Authors' Conclusions

Naltrexone appears to be an effective and safe strategy in alcoholism treatment. Even though the sizes of treatment effects might appear moderate in their magnitudes, these should be valued against the background of the relapsing nature of alcoholism and the limited therapeutic options currently available for its treatment.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^113exgX4]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Buprenorphine — indications, tapering guidance, contraindications, cautions, interactions, and regulatory warnings: Buprenorphine is a partial mu opioid receptor agonist available in a variety of formulations and is recommended for pharmacological treatment of opioid use disorder, and it is also an effective treatment for opioid withdrawal with efficacy similar to methadone and superior to lofexidine or clonidine in opioid withdrawal management. Opioid withdrawal management (i.e. detoxification) on its own, without ongoing treatment for opioid use disorder, is not a treatment method for opioid use disorder and is not recommended; ongoing maintenance medication, in combination with psychosocial treatment appropriate for the patient's needs, is the standard of care for treating opioid use disorder. If tapering is chosen, patients should be advised about the risk of relapse and other safety concerns, including increased risk of overdose and overdose death, and insufficient evidence is available on the relative effectiveness of different rates of tapering the buprenorphine dose; one trial found that longer courses of buprenorphine with gradual tapering were superior to rapid tapering for withdrawal. Buprenorphine is contraindicated for patients with hypersensitivity to buprenorphine or any component of the formulation and patients with severe liver impairment are not good candidates for office-based treatment, while patients with hepatitis C infection who do not have severe liver impairment may be considered for office-based buprenorphine treatment. Buprenorphine should be used with caution for patients with current or past hepatic dysfunction, noting a direct comparison with methadone found no difference in incidence of hepatotoxicity or drug-induced liver damage during the initial 6 months in either treatment groups and that monitoring liver enzymes may be considered, and caution also applies to patients who, at present, have an alcohol use or sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic use disorder and to those with hypovolemia, severe cardiovascular disease, or taking drugs that may exaggerate hypotensive effects because buprenorphine may cause hypotension, including orthostatic hypotension and syncope. Significant interactions include that alcohol and sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics may enhance the central nervous system (CNS) depressive effect of buprenorphine and that buprenorphine is metabolized to nor-buprenorphine primarily by cytochrome CYP3A4, so concomitant use with CYP3A4 inhibitors should be monitored and may require dose reduction of one or both agents. In 2016, based on literature reviews and reported adverse events, the FDA required the addition of warnings on all opioid product labels, including methadone and buprenorphine.

### Medications for alcohol use disorder are increasingly being prescribed in American patients with advanced liver disease [^116XtFdU]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

The number of alcohol use disorder patients with mild (n = 101) and severe alcoholic liver disease (n = 112) increased between 2013 and 2023 (P = 0.06). Naltrexone was prescribed in 65%, acamprosate in 26%, and disulfiram in 9%. Internal medicine providers were the most frequent prescribers (51%), followed by psychiatry (30%) and gastroenterology/hepatology (9%) (P = 0.001). Duration of use was longest with naltrexone compared with acamprosate and disulfiram (360 vs 251 vs 190 days, P = 0.032). The rate of alcohol use disorder medication discontinuation for adverse events was similar in both groups (14% vs 12%). Naltrexone, acamprosate, and disulfiram are increasingly being prescribed in American patients with mild and severe alcohol-related liver disease with similar tolerability and efficacy.

### Unintentional rapid opioid detoxification [^115Vv5j7]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Naltrexone is a long acting opioid antagonist that is used in rehabilitation programmes to maintain heroin abstinence. It is a relatively new drug prescribed by specialists in substance misuse. Its actions and effects may not be familiar to many accident and emergency doctors or even to the people who take it. A case report is described where accidental ingestion of naltrexone results in a medical emergency by precipitating acute withdrawal in a heroin addict.

### Pain as a complication of use of opiate antagonists for symptom control in cholestasis [^115L5tni]. Gastroenterology (2003). Low credibility.

Controlled trials have suggested that opiate antagonist therapy may be effective for the treatment of the symptoms of cholestasis. The oral opiate antagonist naltrexone in particular has started to enter into routine clinical use for amelioration of cholestatic itch. Attention regarding the side effects of opiate antagonist therapy has, to date, largely focused on an opiate withdrawal-type reaction (which can be controlled effectively by titrated therapy introduction regimens). Here we describe 3 cases of a further clinically important side effect, loss of control of pain resulting from other pathologies, which in each case necessitated the withdrawal of hitherto clinically effective opiate antagonist therapy. Of the 14 patients treated by our unit with opiate antagonist agents for the control of cholestatic symptoms, 13 (93%) showed resolution of, or significant improvement in, symptoms. Of the 13 patients showing a clinical response, 7 (54%) subsequently had to discontinue therapy because of side effects (including the 3 patients with uncontrolled pain). It is our experience that in the routine clinical setting, opiate antagonists are highly effective for the treatment of cholestatic symptoms. In practice, however, their usefulness is limited by their side-effect profile.

### Heroin overdose: causes and consequences [^114J5jez]. Addiction (2001). Low credibility.

Over the past decade fatal opioid overdose has emerged as a major public health issue internationally. This paper examines the risk factors for overdose from a biomedical perspective. While significant risk factors for opioid overdose fatality are well recognized, the mechanism of fatal overdose remains unclear. Losses of tolerance and concomitant use of alcohol and other CNS depressants clearly play a major role in fatality; however, such risk factors do not account for the strong age and gender patterns observed consistently among victims of overdose. There is evidence that systemic disease may be more prevalent in users at greatest risk of overdose. We hypothesize that pulmonary and hepatic dysfunction resulting from such disease may increase susceptibility to both fatal and non-fatal overdose. Sequelae of non-fatal overdose are recognized in the clinical literature but few epidemiological data exist describing the burden of morbidity arising from such sequelae. The potential for overdose to cause persisting morbidity is reviewed.

### AASLD practice guidance on primary sclerosing cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma [^113EEoo6]. Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

Pruritus in primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) — Many patients with PSC (30%–60%) suffer from pruritus, which can be severe and disabling; there is no approved treatment for cholestasis-associated pruritus, and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has not been shown to be effective. After obstruction is ruled out by MRI/MRCP, patients should be advised to avoid the heat and hot baths and use topical emollients and antihistamines; if these measures are ineffective, bile acid sequestrants such as cholestyramine (4–16 mg/day) are described, taken approximately 20 min before a meal for optimal effect. Second-line therapies for refractory symptoms include sertraline (100 mg/day), naltrexone (50–100 mg/daily), and rifampin (150–300 mg/day), noting rifampin has been associated with hepatotoxicity, hemolytic anemia, renal failure, and thrombocytopenic purpura. In a randomized controlled trial of 74 patients (46 PSC) with cholestatic itch, bezafibrate 400 mg daily resulted in 45% achieving the primary endpoint of ≥ 50% reduction of pruritus versus 11% with placebo; however, bezafibrate is not currently approved for use in the United States. For patients unresponsive to these regimens, phenobarbital (60–100 mg/day), phototherapy, and plasmapheresis have been reported in small case series as being effective; and in rare cases, liver transplantation (LT) may be indicated.

### Naltrexone: not just for opioids anymore [^114PSZGQ]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2016). Low credibility.

Naltrexone is a semi-synthetic opioid with competitive antagonist activity at mu opioid receptors. Its efficacy has been demonstrated in the treatment of alcohol and opioid dependence, but adherence to daily dosing has been recognized as a factor limiting long-term effectiveness. Recently, a long-acting injectable formulation of naltrexone has received FDA-approval for treating alcohol and opioid dependence. This article reviews the pharmacology of naltrexone, the current evidence supporting the use of extended-release naltrexone, and the clinical challenges in the induction of patients to this medication.

### Liver transplantation for intractable pruritus is contraindicated before an adequate trial of opiate antagonist therapy [^112iQnJ5]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2001). Low credibility.

A woman with stage III (pre-cirrhotic) primary biliary cirrhosis was referred for liver transplantation because of intractable pruritus. Oral administration of 50 mg naltrexone precipitated a severe opioid withdrawal-like reaction. Subsequently, when oral naltrexone therapy was reintroduced following a cautious infusion of naloxone, no reaction occurred and the pruritus resolved completely. Liver transplantation should not be considered for apparently intractable pruritus of cholestasis before an adequate trial of opiate antagonist therapy.

### Efficacy and tolerability of long-acting injectable naltrexone for alcohol dependence… [^113oGHQo]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

*The most common reasons for screening failures included a clinically significant medical condition, active hepatitis, failure to meet an average of 2 episodes of heavy drinking per week for the 30 days. Exclusion criteria included evidence of liver failure; alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase levels greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal; any clinically significant medical condition that in the opinion of the investigator would adversely affect safety or study participation;. the large majority of these episodes occurred only during the first month of treatment. Nausea and decreased appetite occurred more frequently in patients treated with long-acting naltrexone 380 mg. The most common injection site reaction was tenderness, occurring after 15. 9% of 380-mg and
13. 6% of 190-mg naltrexone doses and after 17. 6% of 4-mL.

vs 190 mg and placebo; the group difference being accounted for by a greater number of adverse events of nausea, injection site reaction, and headache). The percentage of patients who experienced SAEs during treatment was similar among the treatment groups: 11 for 380-mg and 10 for 190-mg. pneumonia) were judged by the investigator to be possibly related to study medication. Both events occurred in patients treated with naltrexone 380 mg and resolved with treatment. These complications have not been reported previously with either naltrexone or the PLG microspheres. Mean AST and ALT levels did not change significantly over the course. significant, whereas the treatment effect was not significant in women. Significant treatment effects were observed with long-acting naltrexone 380 mg vs placebo irrespective of whether. patients with alcohol dependence.

Treatment effects were influenced by sex and prerandomization abstinence from alcohol. The efficacy of the 380-mg dose was evident within the first month after the initial injection and was maintained over the 24-week treatment period. Naltrexone injections were well tolerated, few serious adverse events were reported, and there was no evidence of hepatotoxicity.
