## Question

What is the diagnostic evaluation for nipple discharge?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for the diagnostic evaluation of nipple discharge. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about how to frame the initial clinical assessment to distinguish physiologic from pathologic discharge. Then, I should verify the malignancy risk and when imaging is warranted. Next, I will confirm the age- and sex-specific imaging algorithm, followed by what to do when imaging is positive versus negative. After that, I need to evaluate second-line modalities like MRI, CEM, MBI, and the selective role of ductography. I should then reassess the limited role of cytology, outline surgical indications, and finally address special populations and summarize a pragmatic algorithm with supported metrics.

> Let me first confirm the foundation: thorough history and physical examination are essential to classify discharge characteristics and guide testing, focusing on spontaneous versus provoked, unilateral versus bilateral, single-duct versus multiduct, color and duration, associated mass or skin changes, pregnancy/lactation, medications that raise prolactin, and overall breast cancer risk factors including age and family history, while on exam assessing the breast and axilla, and if needed gently expressing discharge to determine uniductal versus multiductal origin and color, because this classification strongly predicts the need for imaging and the risk of malignancy [^1155BXy7] [^116hjWW4] [^112oGkEa] [^113MM9mn].

> Hold on, I should verify the classification thresholds I am using. Physiologic discharge is typically bilateral, multiductal, non-spontaneous and often white, yellow, or green, and generally does not require diagnostic imaging, whereas pathologic nipple discharge is characteristically unilateral, uniductal, spontaneous, and serous, clear, or bloody, and it mandates imaging because malignancy is found in roughly 8–15% overall and can be as high as 3–23% across series, with bloody discharge carrying the highest risk signal [^1155BXy7] [^112oGkEa] [^117Knfeo] [^113MM9mn].

> Next, I should review the overarching imaging appropriateness based on discharge type. If the clinical picture fits physiologic discharge, reassurance and avoidance of imaging is appropriate; but if it meets criteria for pathologic discharge, age- and sex-appropriate breast imaging should proceed to exclude malignancy, acknowledging that small retroareolar intraductal lesions without calcifications can elude mammography and sometimes ultrasound, keeping pretest suspicion meaningfully elevated despite normal initial studies [^1155BXy7] [^112oGkEa] [^1124mgL3].

> I need to ensure I am applying the ACR-based algorithm correctly by age and gender. For women aged 40 years and older, diagnostic mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis should be performed and paired with targeted retroareolar ultrasound; for ages 30–39 years, institutions may start with mammography/DBT or ultrasound, noting that ultrasound tends to have higher sensitivity in this group; for women younger than 30 years, ultrasound is first-line, with mammography added when findings are suspicious or risk is high; in men, because malignancy rates are markedly higher with pathologic discharge, mammography/DBT is recommended from age 25 with ultrasound as indicated, and a similar risk-adapted approach applies to transgender patients [^1155BXy7] [^111AtwfA] [^1156WNSp].

> Wait, let me verify performance metrics for initial imaging so I do not overstate or understate expectations. Contemporary data show that combining mammography with ultrasound achieves about 93% sensitivity with a negative predictive value around 98% for malignancy in nipple discharge cohorts, and CE-MRI can reach 100% sensitivity and NPV in some series, which is important context when counseling patients about the implications of a negative workup and when deciding on escalation to MRI if MG/US are negative but clinical suspicion persists [^116iELbS].

> If imaging identifies a suspicious target, I should confirm the next best step. Targeted image-guided core needle biopsy provides tissue diagnosis and directs management; intraductal papilloma, the most common benign cause of pathologic discharge, often appears on ultrasound as a solid mass within a dilated duct and may show a fibrovascular stalk on Doppler, features that, when present, support proceeding to percutaneous tissue sampling rather than empiric surgery [^111AtwfA] [^113nSHWF].

> But what if initial mammography and ultrasound are negative or inconclusive while the discharge remains pathologic. I should double-check escalation pathways: breast MRI is the preferred second-line test because 3.0 Tesla MRI demonstrates very high sensitivity, improved specificity compared with ductography, excellent correlation with histopathology for lesion size, and a negative predictive value that can approach 100%, meaning a negative MRI can often obviate surgery when clinical suspicion is otherwise low to moderate [^11621fJR] [^113MM9mn] [^116iELbS].

> I will now examine alternatives when MRI is contraindicated or unavailable. Contrast-enhanced mammography can serve as a viable substitute in this problem-solving context, and molecular breast imaging with Tc-99m sestamibi shows sensitivity comparable to MRI with higher specificity in multiple series, making it particularly useful for patients with dense breasts, implants, claustrophobia, or renal impairment precluding MRI contrast, and in selected discharge cohorts it has reclassified cases and identified malignancies missed by conventional imaging [^113MM9mn] [^116Ff2xC].

> Hold on, I should verify the residual role for ductography so I neither overuse nor prematurely discard it. While MRI has largely supplanted ductography, ductography remains valuable when there is persistent pathologic discharge with negative mammography/ultrasound and MRI is contraindicated or unavailable, when MRI is equivocal or falsely negative, or when multiple MRI findings require precise ductal localization; it can guide targeted ultrasound by dilating ducts and reveal filling defects for same-session biopsy, though its specificity is limited, so results must be integrated carefully with clinical and imaging context to avoid over- or under-excision [^1124mgL3] [^11621fJR] [^111eTsj7].

> Let me consider the role of nipple discharge cytology, and I should be cautious not to overinterpret it. Meta-analyses and programmatic data show limited diagnostic accuracy with variable sensitivity and notable false negatives, especially for malignancy, making cytology an adjunct at best; wait, I initially recalled sensitivity around 62% for cancer, but I need to check more granular data showing even lower sensitivity, sometimes 11–34.6% for malignancy, which underscores why cytology should not replace imaging or surgical evaluation when suspicion remains high, despite its occasional utility within a broader triple assessment [^116jmMMf] [^114MPd1r] [^112SB6mu] [^114VQmZs].

> Next, I should review indications for surgical evaluation when discharge persists. Surgery, typically microdochectomy or central duct excision, is indicated for persistent pathologic discharge despite negative or non-diagnostic imaging, when clinical suspicion remains high, or when a lesion is identified but not amenable to percutaneous biopsy; preoperative ductography or intraoperative ductoscopy can localize the pathologic duct and reduce blind excisions, and long-term data after central duct excision show effective diagnosis and treatment with low missed-malignancy risk, though delayed ipsilateral cancers can still occur years later and warrant continued surveillance [^112sA3vV] [^1124mgL3] [^112dpbEi].

> But wait, what about risk stratification in special populations where my threshold for surgery might shift. In postmenopausal women, the cancer rate with pathologic discharge is around 9–12% and many experts recommend a low threshold for duct excision, with some series mandating surgery for bloody discharge in women aged 55 or older; in men, pathologic discharge carries a malignancy risk of roughly 23–57% and warrants prompt, thorough evaluation; in infants and young children, bloody discharge is usually due to benign duct ectasia and resolves spontaneously, so conservative management with ultrasound confirmation and reassurance is preferred; and during pregnancy and lactation, most discharge is physiologic but persistent pathologic features should prompt an imaging workup prioritizing ultrasound and MRI to avoid ionizing radiation [^115uhVhr] [^113ioJ4R] [^11536fFs] [^116rBJvZ] [^1141cK5Z] [^116WGQaw] [^116hjWW4].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I should reconcile one more apparent discrepancy about ultrasound utility. Older narratives sometimes minimized ultrasound's contribution in nipple discharge, yet contemporary single-institution series demonstrate that targeted retroareolar ultrasound, especially when combined with mammography, substantially improves sensitivity and NPV, aligning with ACR guidance to pair modalities in patients 40 and older and to favor ultrasound first in younger women, which supports using current evidence rather than legacy assumptions when counseling and ordering tests [^116iELbS] [^1155BXy7] [^111AtwfA].

> To conclude, let me synthesize a practical, evidence-aligned algorithm and confirm it is coherent. First, classify discharge clinically into physiologic versus pathologic, reserving imaging for pathologic features; second, apply age- and sex-specific initial imaging with mammography/DBT plus targeted ultrasound as appropriate; third, biopsy any imaging-detected lesion; fourth, if initial imaging is negative but suspicion persists, escalate to MRI as preferred secondary imaging, with CEM or MBI as alternatives and ductography reserved for select localization or problem-solving scenarios; fifth, for persistent pathologic discharge with negative imaging or non-biopsiable targets, proceed to surgical duct excision with selective use of ductoscopy; and throughout, use cytology sparingly as an adjunct, recognizing its limitations and high false-negative potential, to minimize missed malignancies while avoiding unnecessary procedures [^1155BXy7] [^116iELbS] [^11621fJR] [^116Ff2xC] [^1124mgL3] [^116jmMMf].

The workup for nipple discharge begins with a **focused history and exam** to classify the discharge as physiologic or pathologic [^1155BXy7]. Physiologic discharge (bilateral, multiductal, non-spontaneous) generally requires no imaging [^1155BXy7], whereas **pathologic discharge** (unilateral, uniductal, spontaneous, bloody, or associated with a mass) warrants age- and gender-specific imaging: mammography/DBT plus ultrasound for women ≥ 40 years; ultrasound first for women < 30 years; and mammography/DBT plus ultrasound for men ≥ 25 years [^1155BXy7] [^111AtwfA]. If initial imaging is negative or inconclusive, **MRI is the next step** [^116iELbS] [^11621fJR]; galactography or ductoscopy are reserved for persistent cases when MRI is unavailable or inconclusive [^1124mgL3] [^113MM9mn]. Nipple discharge cytology is not recommended because of low sensitivity; biopsy is indicated for suspicious imaging or persistent pathologic discharge [^116jmMMf] [^114MPd1r] [^112sA3vV].

---

## Clinical history and physical examination

A thorough clinical history and physical examination are **essential first steps** in evaluating nipple discharge [^116VBFXx]. Key history elements include:

- **Discharge characteristics**: color (bloody, serous, milky, green, yellow), consistency, spontaneity, unilateral vs. bilateral, single vs. multiple ducts.

- **Associated symptoms**: breast mass, pain, skin changes, systemic symptoms.

- **Medical history**: pregnancy, lactation, medications (e.g. antipsychotics, antidepressants, hormonal therapies), endocrine disorders (hyperprolactinemia, hypothyroidism), prior breast surgery or trauma [^116hjWW4].

- **Family history**: breast cancer or other malignancies.

Physical examination should include:

- **Inspection**: nipple-areolar complex for skin changes, retraction, inversion, or visible discharge [^1112Bfzt].

- **Palpation**: breasts and axillae for masses or lymphadenopathy.

- **Expression**: gentle compression to assess discharge characteristics and duct involvement.

---

## Classification of nipple discharge

Nipple discharge is **classified** as physiologic or pathologic based on clinical features [^1155BXy7]:

| **Physiological discharge** | **Pathological discharge** |
|-|-|
| Bilateral | Unilateral |
| Multiductal | Single duct |
| Non-spontaneous | Spontaneous |
| Milky, green, yellow | Bloody, serous, clear |
| Associated with pregnancy, lactation, medications, endocrine disorders | Associated with breast mass, skin changes, or systemic symptoms |

---

Physiologic discharge typically requires no further imaging or intervention, whereas **pathologic discharge** warrants further evaluation to exclude malignancy [^116iELbS].

---

## Imaging modalities

Imaging is essential for evaluating **pathologic nipple discharge**; the modality is guided by patient age, gender, and clinical presentation [^1155BXy7]:

| **Patient group** | **Initial imaging modality** | **Additional imaging** |
|-|-|-|
| Women ≥ 40 years | Mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) | Ultrasound |
| Women 30–39 years | Mammography/DBT or ultrasound | Based on clinical suspicion |
| Women < 30 years | Ultrasound | Mammography/DBT if suspicious findings or high risk |
| Men ≥ 25 years | Mammography/DBT | Ultrasound |

- **Mammography/DBT**: Useful for detecting calcifications and masses, particularly in older patients [^111AtwfA].

- **Ultrasound**: Effective for identifying intraductal masses, duct ectasia, and guiding biopsies [^113nSHWF].

- **MRI**: High sensitivity and negative predictive value, useful when initial imaging is inconclusive or negative [^116iELbS] [^11621fJR].

- **Galactography**: Reserved for persistent pathological discharge with negative conventional imaging or when MRI is unavailable [^1124mgL3] [^111eTsj7].

- **Ductoscopy**: Direct visualization of intraductal lesions, useful for targeted excision [^112dpbEi].

---

## Laboratory tests

Laboratory evaluation is **indicated** in select clinical scenarios and should be tailored to the suspected etiology. Specifically, obtain a pregnancy test in premenopausal women with milky discharge; measure serum prolactin when hyperprolactinemia or galactorrhea is suspected; order thyroid function tests if hypothyroidism is a concern; and assess renal function when chronic renal failure is suspected [^116VBFXx].

---

## Nipple discharge cytology

Nipple discharge cytology has limited diagnostic accuracy, with low sensitivity and a high false-negative rate [^116jmMMf]. Routine use is **not recommended**, but it may be considered in select cases when malignancy is strongly suspected and other diagnostic methods are inconclusive [^114MPd1r] [^114VQmZs].

---

## Indications for biopsy or surgical intervention

Biopsy or surgical intervention is **indicated** in the following scenarios [^1155BXy7]:

- **Suspicious imaging findings**: Masses, calcifications, or intraductal lesions identified on mammography, ultrasound, or MRI [^116iELbS].

- **Persistent pathological discharge**: Despite negative imaging results [^1124mgL3].

- **High-risk clinical features**: Bloody discharge, unilateral single-duct discharge, palpable mass, or abnormal skin changes [^1155BXy7].

- **Male patients**: Due to higher malignancy risk [^11536fFs].

Biopsy options include **core needle biopsy, fine-needle aspiration, or excisional biopsy**, selected based on lesion characteristics and clinical suspicion [^112sA3vV].

---

## Follow-up and management

Management and follow-up depend on the underlying diagnosis. Benign conditions are managed conservatively with reassurance and routine follow-up [^113yeWnQ]. Malignant conditions warrant surgical excision, oncologic evaluation, and appropriate cancer therapy. Persistent discharge requires ongoing surveillance with repeat imaging and consideration of surgical intervention if symptoms persist [^116iELbS].

---

## Special considerations

Special considerations include **pregnancy and lactation**, for which ultrasound is the initial imaging modality of choice; mammography can be performed with shielding if necessary [^1155BXy7]. Male patients have a higher malignancy risk and therefore require thorough evaluation and imaging [^11536fFs]. In pediatric patients, conservative management is preferred, with ultrasound as the initial imaging modality [^116rBJvZ].

---

The workup for nipple discharge follows a **structured approach**: begin with clinical assessment, then proceed to imaging and targeted laboratory tests. Pathologic discharge requires further evaluation to exclude malignancy, whereas **physiologic discharge** typically needs no intervention [^111AtwfA].

### Breast ductography: To do or not to do? A pictorial essay [^1124mgL3]. Insights into Imaging (2023). High credibility.

Ductography remains useful in specific scenarios. When a patient has pathological nipple discharge and multiple lesions detected on conventional imaging or MRI, such as multiple papillomas, ductography can help identify the offending lesion and target it for biopsy or preoperative localization.

In cases of diffuse small intraductal cancers without microscopic invasive components, patients might present with bloody nipple discharge. Often, palpable abnormalities are absent, and conventional imaging results like mammography and ultrasound are mostly negative or nonspecific.

Ductography proves valuable when pathological nipple discharge occurs alongside negative conventional imaging and contraindications for MRI or unavailability of MRI. In falsely negative MRI cases, such as marked background parenchymal enhancement or low-grade DCIS, ductography can reveal the nature and extent of lesions.

If imaging results are negative but ductal discharge persists, performing ductography before surgery can prevent under or over-excision from blind central duct excision, reducing the risk of leaving the underlying lesion unaddressed.

With negative conventional images and findings like filling defects in ductography, a targeted ultrasound can be performed immediately after ductography. The contrast-induced dilatation of the duct enhances lesion conspicuity in ultrasound, allowing for an ultrasound-guided biopsy in the same session.

Ductography-guided procedures might be needed in cases of persistent pathological nipple discharge without an apparent lesion on conventional imaging.

### An update on multimodal imaging strategies for nipple discharge: from detection to decision [^113MM9mn]. Insights into Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

Nipple discharge affects over 80% of women at some point in their lives, with malignancy detected in up to 23% of cases. This review highlights the shift from traditional surgical approaches to advanced imaging techniques, which enhance diagnostic accuracy and reduce unnecessary procedures. Diagnosis begins with a thorough medical history and physical examination to assess the need for imaging.

Physiological nipple discharge, which is bilateral, multiductal, and non-spontaneous, typically requires no imaging. Conversely, pathological nipple discharge (PND), characteristically unilateral, uniductal, and spontaneous, requires imaging to rule out malignancy. Bloody PND is frequently associated with breast cancer, and up to 12% of non-bloody PND cases also involve malignancy.

For women over 40 years, the first-line imaging modality is full-field digital mammography (FFDM) or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), usually combined with ultrasound (US). Men with PND undergo FFDM/DBT starting at age 25 years due to their higher risk of breast cancer. For women aged 30–39 years, US is the first assessment tool, with FFDM/DBT added if necessary, while US is preferred for younger women and men.

When initial imaging is negative or inconclusive, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful, often replacing galactography. With its high sensitivity and negative predictive value of almost 100%, a negative MRI can often obviate the need for surgery. Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) offers a viable alternative when MRI is not feasible. Although invasive, ductoscopy helps identify issues accurately.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® evaluation of nipple discharge: 2022 update [^1155BXy7]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Low credibility.

The type of nipple discharge dictates the appropriate imaging study. Physiologic nipple discharge is common and does not require diagnostic imaging. Pathologic nipple discharge in women, men, and transgender patients necessitates breast imaging. Evidence-based guidelines were used to evaluate breast imaging modalities for appropriateness based on patient age and gender.

- **Age 40 and above**: For adult females or males 40 years of age or greater, mammography or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is performed initially. Breast ultrasound is usually performed at the same time, with rare exceptions.

- **Age 30 to 39**: For males or females aged 30 to 39 years, mammography/DBT or breast ultrasound is performed based on institutional preference and individual patient considerations.

- **Age under 30**: For young women less than 30 years of age, ultrasound is performed first, with mammography/DBT added if there are suspicious findings or if the patient is at elevated lifetime risk for developing breast cancer.

There is a high incidence of breast cancer in males with pathologic discharge. Men 25 years and older should be evaluated using mammography/DBT, with ultrasound added when indicated. In transfeminine (male-to-female) patients, mammography/DBT and ultrasound are useful due to the increased incidence of breast cancer.

The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals.

### Breast ductography: To do or not to do? A pictorial essay [^112oGkEa]. Insights into Imaging (2023). Low credibility.

Nipple discharge is a commonly seen presentation in breast clinics and represents 4.8% of the presenting symptoms in all women with breast-related complaints. In most cases, nipple discharges are non-pathological and are not associated with breast neoplasms. Physiological discharges are commonly white, yellow, or green and occur from several ducts bilaterally. The etiology of physiological discharges includes hypothyroidism, pituitary prolactinoma, and medication side effects.

Pathological nipple discharge is described as uniorifice, spontaneous, bloody, clear, or serosanguinous. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and papillary lesions are the most common etiology for pathological nipple discharge. Since 8–15% of pathological nipple discharges are related to malignant neoplasms, it necessitates investigation.

Some specialists believe that ductography is a time-consuming and challenging procedure that can be substituted by other methods, such as sonography or MRI. However, in many cases, conventional imaging such as mammography and sonography fails to detect the underlying causes of pathological nipple discharge since the lesions are small and prove to be completely intraductal. Although contrast-enhanced MRI demonstrates high sensitivity for detecting malignancy when there is a pathological discharge, there are some limitations: low specificity, MRI cost, time-consuming exam, availability, gadolinium allergy, and severe claustrophobia.

If there is persistent pathologic nipple discharge with negative conventional imaging, the surgeon may proceed with ductal exploration.

### Bloody nipple discharge in infancy: A case report and recommendations for management [^1141cK5Z]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2013). Low credibility.

We report a 5-month-old male infant with benign unilateral bloody nipple discharge, and we present a brief review of 20 previously described cases of bloody nipple discharge in infancy. Based on our case and previous reports, we offer recommendations for the management of bloody nipple discharge in the first year of life:

- **Diagnosis should be based**: on noninvasive diagnostic procedures, in the absence of dubious ultrasound or cytological diagnostic findings.
- **The condition resolves**: spontaneously, and surgical intervention should be avoided.
- **Manipulation of the nipple**: can prolong the bleeding.
- **Antibiotics should be given**: only in the presence of clear clinical and cytological signs of infection.
- **Parent reassurance is**: an important part of infantile bloody nipple discharge management.

### Breast ductography: To do or not to do? A pictorial essay [^115Ao5Z1]. Insights into Imaging (2023). Low credibility.

Nipple discharge is a frequent clinical presentation in breast disease. Although most cases of nipple discharge are physiological, pathological nipple discharge is not uncommon and is associated with malignancy in 8 to 15% of cases, requiring investigation. Some specialists argue that ductography is a challenging procedure better substituted by other methods, such as MRI. However, an experienced physician can perform ductography quickly and easily, still playing an essential role in certain clinical scenarios. Conventional imaging techniques, such as mammography and sonography, often fail to detect the underlying causes of pathological nipple discharge. MRI has limitations, including low specificity, cost, lengthy exam duration, accessibility, and patient factors such as claustrophobia. By coupling ductography with other methods, such as ultrasound-guided or stereotactic biopsy, we can achieve specific diagnosis and appropriate treatment. This study aims to present the ductography technique, explore possible findings, and identify the clinical settings where ductography is useful.

- **Critical relevance statement**: Although ductography is currently less used in breast imaging, it still plays an essential role in certain clinical scenarios. These include pathological nipple discharge with negative conventional imaging, contraindicated or unavailable MRI, unremarkable MRI results, and multiple MRI findings.

- **Key points**:
	- Conventional imaging commonly fails to detect the underlying causes of pathological nipple discharge.
	- MRI in the setting of nipple discharge…

### An update on multimodal imaging strategies for nipple discharge: from detection to decision [^116hjWW4]. Insights into Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

The first step in determining whether nipple discharge is physiological or pathological is a thorough medical history and physical examination. A detailed history helps assess the patient's health status, medications, and risk factors for breast cancer, such as age and a personal and/or family history of the disease. The physical examination includes inspecting and palpating both breasts and axillary regions. For non-spontaneous discharge, breast compression is required to assess the color of the discharge and whether it is uniductal or multiductal. The clinical examination may also reveal other associated signs, such as palpable lumps, glandular asymmetry, or changes in the nipple-areolar complex. On examination, the presence of palpable suspicious lumps has also been related to a higher risk of breast cancer.

Physiological nipple discharge is usually bilateral, multiductal, and non-spontaneous. The discharge can be white, green, or yellow. Lactational discharge, which occurs during pregnancy, lactation, or even after the first year post-weaning, is considered normal and distinct from galactorrhoea. The most common cause of physiological nipple discharge is drug-induced hyperprolactinemia (particularly due to antipsychotics). When hyperprolactinemia is medication-related, discontinuing the drug, if possible, is recommended. Other causes include pregnancy, chronic renal failure, cirrhosis, pituitary adenomas, hypothalamic lesions, and unidentifiable causes.

### Diagnostic accuracy of nipple discharge fluid cytology: A meta-analysis and systematic review of the literature [^116jmMMf]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

Nipple discharge is the third most frequent complaint of women attending rapid diagnostic breast clinics. Nipple smear cytology remains the single most used diagnostic method for investigating fluid content. This study aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of nipple discharge fluid assessment.

- **Methods**: The study incorporated searches for studies interrogating the diagnostic data of nipple discharge fluid cytology compared with the histopathology gold standard. Data from studies published from 1956 to 2019 were analyzed. The analysis included 8,648 cytology samples of women with a presenting complaint of nipple discharge. Both hierarchical and bivariate models for diagnostic meta-analysis were used to attain overall pooled sensitivity and specificity.

- **Results**: Of 837 studies retrieved, 45 fulfilled the criteria for inclusion. The diagnostic accuracy of the meta-analysis examining nipple discharge fluid had a sensitivity of 75% (95% confidence interval, 0.74–0.77) and a specificity of 87% (95% CI, 0.86–0.87) for benign breast disease. For breast cancer, it had a sensitivity of 62% (95% CI, 0.53–0.71) and a specificity of 71% (95% CI, 0.57–0.81). Furthermore, patients presenting with blood-stained discharge yielded an overall malignancy rate of 58% (95% CI, 0.54–0.60) with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 27% (95% CI, 0.17–0.36).

- **Conclusions**: Pooled data from studies encompassing nipple discharge fluid assessment suggest that nipple smear cytology is of limited diagnostic accuracy. The authors recommend further investigation into alternative diagnostic methods for more results that are reliable.

### Management of nipple discharge and the associated imaging findings [^113yeWnQ]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Nipple discharge is commonly encountered by health care providers, accounting for 2% to 5% of medical visits by women. Because nipple discharge is the presenting symptom in 5% to 12% of breast cancers, it causes considerable anxiety for both patients and providers. Furthermore, the work-up and management of nipple discharge can be confusing.

Fortunately, the cause of nipple discharge is usually benign. The primary goal of evaluation and management is the separation of patients with pathologic causes of discharge from those with benign or physiologic causes. The evaluation of nipple discharge requires a thorough history, careful physical examination, and an informed approach that selects the most suitable diagnostic modality. Primary care providers, working with their radiologists and surgeons, are well positioned to design appropriate diagnostic and management protocols to assess and treat nipple discharge. A thoughtful and prudent approach to nipple discharge should alleviate patient anxiety by efficiently and effectively defining the underlying etiology.

### Infant bloody nipple discharge: Diagnostic approach in primary healthcare [^116WQMu4]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

This case details a female infant who presented with unilateral bloody nipple discharge during a primary healthcare visit, a rare but typically benign condition. The infant, exclusively breastfed and healthy, showed no signs of trauma or infection. A small, mobile nodule was found beneath the affected nipple. Investigations conducted within primary healthcare, including blood tests and a breast ultrasound, confirmed benign findings with no signs of malignancy. The case was managed entirely within primary healthcare, and the symptoms resolved spontaneously over a 2-month follow-up.

This case underscores the importance of healthcare professionals being familiar with such presentations to confidently adopt a conservative management approach. This reduces unnecessary interventions and alleviates parental anxiety. The findings align with existing literature, emphasizing that such cases are usually benign and self-limiting, reinforcing the value of a cautious, informed approach.

### Multimodality approach to the nipple-areolar complex: A pictorial review and diagnostic algorithm [^113dmxG9]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Pathological enhancement in the nipple-areolar complex is demonstrated in a 71-year-old woman. Axial contrast-enhanced T1-weighted spoiled gradient-echo (subtracted) images show asymmetric irregular nodular early enhancement, which is maintained in late phases due to involvement by invasive ductal carcinoma. An irregular-shaped mass-like enhancement is observed in the middle third of the junction of the outer quadrants in the right breast, with linear uptake and segmental distribution to the nipple-areolar complex, indicating an intraductal component.

MRI is useful to complement mammography and ultrasound in the diagnostic management of pathological nipple discharge and to guide percutaneous biopsy.

- **Galactography**: This procedure is indicated for patients with pathological discharge from the nipple (unilateral, from a single duct, spontaneous, and persistent with a clear, serous, or bloody appearance) and negative findings on mammography and ultrasound. To perform the canalization of the secreting orifice, the nipple must be gently but firmly secured between the thumb and forefinger to inject undiluted iodinated contrast material using a 30-gauge cannula. With the cannula fixed in place, a magnified craniocaudal projection is obtained. Patients may experience local pain if contrast material extravasates.

### Diagnostic accuracy of nipple discharge fluid cytology: A meta-analysis and systematic review of the literature [^112SB6mu]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

Despite the challenges associated with nipple cytologic analysis, and notwithstanding the small proportion of patients presenting with pathological nipple discharge (PND) who will go on to receive a breast cancer diagnosis, it may be the only presenting clinical symptom of a breast cancer and therefore cannot be dismissed. Although cytology is no longer used in some centers, nipple smear cytology continues to be used in clinical practice globally. The rationale behind its use is that the majority of breast cancers arise from the epithelial lining of the terminal ducts and thus are denoted as invasive ductal carcinomas. Therefore, it is accepted that nipple discharge fluid directly reflects the tumor microenvironment and, for high-risk individuals, indicates the lead-up to cancer. However, it has also been shown that not all ducts drain to the nipple surface, suggesting that even if adequate, cytologic analysis could miss a proportion of breast cancers.

A further challenge is the range of cellular findings and whether this is representative of benign or malignant disease. For example, papillary clusters can be a cytologic finding of both benign and malignant pathologies.

Because the reviewed diagnostic methods have limited ability to confirm or exclude a breast cancer diagnosis for patients presenting with PND, surgical intervention in the form of a microdochectomy or total duct excision is required for a definitive diagnosis or adequate reassurance. Indeed, the findings of this meta-analysis might suggest that such patients could undergo imaging to exclude mass lesions, possibly including MRI.

### Breast ductography: To do or not to do? A pictorial essay [^112aNH2v]. Insights into Imaging (2023). Low credibility.

Mammography and ultrasound are indicated for all women with pathological nipple discharge. Calcifications are the most important finding that we look for in mammography. In pathological nipple discharge, mammography is positive in 50–90% of patients with malignancy but less than 50% with benign papillomas. Ultrasound (US) by an experienced sonologist may detect intraductal masses. In standard practice, the US is seldom helpful in establishing the cause of nipple discharge.

In the study by Srinivasan, similar sensitivities were reported for ductography and conventional breast imaging in patients with breast cancer, while in high-risk lesions, ductography was significantly more sensitive. In patients with intraductal benign papilloma, ductography was more sensitive than non-invasive imaging but with a minimal difference. The same study showed that conventional imaging had better specificity in distinguishing benign and malignant lesions.

In the recent study by Younjung Choi, ductography was combined with US and showed higher sensitivity (94.1% [16/17]) for detecting malignancy in patients with pathological nipple discharge and negative mammography than initial ultrasound (47.1% [8/17], p = 0.013).

### Diagnostic accuracy of abnormal galactographic and sonographic findings in the diagnosis of intraductal pathology in patients with abnormal nipple discharge [^111eTsj7]. Clinical Imaging (2015). Low credibility.

The purpose of the study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the combination of galactography and ultrasound in patients with pathologic nipple discharge. Fifty-six patients with pathologic nipple discharge were included in the study. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) for each method and the combination of both were calculated. Both methods together had a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 91%, 17%, 61%, and 57% respectively. The combined sensitivity of galactography and ultrasound for intraductal pathologies is higher than either modality alone, although it exhibits low specificity. There are no specific signs that can predict benign or malignant lesions.

### Diagnosis and management of a herpes nipple infection that resulted in neonatal HSV encephalitis [^117PBZQH]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

Nipple dermatitis and pain are common postpartum issues with several aetiologies. Symptoms may be due to modifiable factors such as improper latch techniques or flange size. Other causes include dermatitis, eczema, psoriasis, or infectious aetiologies such as HSV, bacterial infections, or candida. After a thorough history is obtained, a complete physical exam, including a breast exam, is necessary to identify any swelling, erythema, ulcers, fissures, vesicles, or masses.

The most common cause of nipple fissure is poor latch technique, which includes suboptimal infant positioning and either excessive or inadequate sucking by the neonate. Similarly, incorrect use of a breast pump or a poorly fitted flange can cause nipple trauma and pain, which can be addressed with the help of lactation specialists. Our patient had preterm infants and attempted direct breastfeeding during her hospital course but was primarily pumping to express breastmilk, putting her at increased risk of nipple trauma.

Pre-existing skin breakdown at the nipple can serve as the entry point for pathogens. Conversely, inflammation and irritation due to infection can precipitate nipple cracking. Our patient had some erythema at the site of the fissure, but in the absence of streaking erythema, purulent discharge, or systemic symptoms, secondary or bacterial infection was lower on the differential. Further, her symptoms were not consistent with candidiasis since the patient did not have burning or constant breast pain, no recent antibiotic use, and no history of recent vaginal thrush.

### Twenty-year outcome following central duct resection for bloody nipple discharge [^112dpbEi]. Annals of Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Patients with pathologic nipple discharge present a diagnostic dilemma to surgeons. No single diagnostic test, including cytology or radiologic imaging, has proved superior in differentiating between benign and malignant sources of pathologic nipple discharge. Ductoscopy has been introduced as a method to assist in identifying potential sources of pathologic nipple discharge. It is also useful in the resection of deep or peripheral masses that may be missed with standard blind resection. This report evaluates the risk of missed malignancy following central duct resection (CDR).

- **Methods**: Records of 56 patients who underwent CDR for pathologic nipple discharge more than 15 years prior were reviewed. Data, including type of nipple discharge, future biopsy, and pathology reports, were examined.

- **Results**: Of the 56 patients, 36 had bloody discharge, 18 serous, and 2 green initial discharges. Fifty-seven percent were found to have intraductal papilloma as the source of discharge, with fibrocystic disease and ductal ectasia as the next most common causes. One woman was found to have ductal cancer and another lobular carcinoma in situ at the time of CDR. Patients were followed for a mean period of 22 years. Fourteen women required future biopsy; of these, 10 had benign disease and 4 had cancer, with 3 on the ipsilateral side. The 3 women with breast cancer were 9, 13, and 17 years from initial resection.

- **Conclusions**: CDR for pathologic nipple discharge is an effective method to diagnose and treat pathologic nipple discharge without missing underlying conditions.

### Can molecular breast imaging with Tc-99m sestamibi safely rule out malignancy in pathologic nipple discharge [^116Ff2xC]? Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2025). High credibility.

The SNMMI Procedure Standard/EANM Practice Guideline for Molecular Breast Imaging with Dedicated Gamma-Cameras, published in 2022, states that the common indications for MBI are the evaluation of indeterminate imaging findings, local staging, monitoring response to neoadjuvant therapy, screening, surveillance for breast cancer recurrence, and problem-solving in cases of dense breasts, implants, free silicone, claustrophobia, or when breast MRI is contraindicated or unavailable. Several studies showed similar sensitivity between MBI and MRI (89%–97%) but higher specificity rates of MBI compared with MRI (77%–89% vs. 40%–68%).

In a retrospective work performed in our institution, we evaluated MBI conducted in 226 patients with equivocal breast abnormalities after conventional diagnostic imaging with mammography and ultrasound (CD). We found discordant findings between MBI and CD imaging, enabling correct adjustment of treatment in 20% of patients, mostly due to the detection of malignant lesions by MBI not identified by other modalities. We also verified that in the subgroup of patients with nipple discharge, MBI correctly adjusted imaging classification in 21%, in particular, by identifying breast cancer in 19% of patients (none had been depicted on mammography and ultrasound).

Considering the limited knowledge of breast imaging in nipple discharge and the clinical importance of accurately differentiating benign from malignant disease in a noninvasive way in the case of pathologic nipple discharge, the study was conducted.

### An update on multimodal imaging strategies for nipple discharge: From detection to decision [^117Knfeo]. Insights into Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

Nipple discharge is the third most common breast complaint after breast pain and palpable breast masses, with a prevalence ranging from 4.8% to 7.4%. More than 80% of women experience nipple discharge at some point in their lives.

Based on its characteristics and clinical context, nipple discharge can be classified as either physiological or pathological, with the latter requiring breast imaging assessment. Although most causes of pathological nipple discharge (PND) are benign, malignancy is detected in 3% to 23% of cases. Consequently, the key challenge in managing this complaint is to exclude malignant lesions while minimizing unnecessary surgical interventions.

This article reviews the diagnostic approach and management of nipple discharge in the era of multimodal imaging and proposes a diagnostic algorithm. The article also discusses the main breast diseases causing PND, and their radiological and histological correlations.

### Breast ductography: To do or not to do? A pictorial essay [^11223kVq]. Insights into Imaging (2023). Low credibility.

A 82-year-old woman with a history of resected DCIS in the right breast presented with a 3-week history of serous sanguineous spontaneous nipple discharge. Post-surgical changes were observed in the right upper outer quadrant, including a known seroma, which appeared slightly decreased compared to previous images. The right breast ultrasound detected no suspicious lesions. During ductography, multiple ducts were opacified and extended into the upper outer breast towards the lumpectomy site, with a cut-off at the seroma site. No filling defects within the ducts were identified. The nipple discharge was suspected to originate from a seroma, possibly due to fistulization of the seroma within the ducts. A short-term follow-up ultrasound was recommended. After a few months, the discharge stopped.

- **Ducts communicating with cysts**: Communication between ducts and cysts can cause nipple discharge due to decompression of cyst fluid into the ducts. Normal or dilated ducts communicating with cysts may suggest fibrocystic changes in ductography.

A 48-year-old woman presented with right breast brown color nipple discharge. Ductography radiographs showed adequate opacification of the ducts with no evidence of a filling defect to suggest the cause of nipple discharge. Areas of mild ductal dilatation, some anterior pruning, and mild dilation of the terminal ductal lobular unit were suggestive of fibrocystic change. The nipple discharge resolved within 6 months.

### Nipple discharge: When is it worrisome [^115baDCe]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

Nipple discharge is the third most common breast-related complaint seen in breast clinics. Although the majority of cases are due to a benign etiology, 5%-12% of cases with pathological nipple discharge may harbor an underlying malignancy. Therefore, a thorough radiological workup in cases of pathological nipple discharge is of utmost importance, with the initial imaging modality depending on the age of the patient. The imaging modalities include mammogram (MG) and ultrasound (US), with the addition of breast MRI if the nipple discharge is clinically suspicious and no MG or US correlate is identified. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) also holds promise in demonstrating the exact extent of pathology detected on US, thus aiding in the planning of further management.

### Bilateral bloody nipple discharge in a male infant: sonographic findings and proposed diagnostic approach [^113SHqtR]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Bloody nipple discharge is an uncommon finding in the pediatric population, without clear diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines established. We noted a case of a 3-month-old male infant who presented with bilateral blood-stained nipple discharge, with an unremarkable medical history. Sonographic findings revealed bilaterally dilated ducts and cysts with mixed iso- and hypoechoic intraductal content. Possible causes of this condition include hyperlaxity syndrome with decreased function of elastic fibers and fibrocystic changes in breasts, as well as an unusual response to maternal hormones transferred to the neonate either transplacentally or through breastfeeding. Given the most probable benign etiology and self-limiting nature of the described condition, a conservative approach is suggested. Unnecessary invasive procedures should be avoided.

### Is chronic nipple piercing associated with hyperprolactinemia [^111mHCGW]. Pituitary (2013). Low credibility.

Literature on hyperprolactinemia in the context of nipple piercing is limited to individuals with concomitant breast or chest wall infection. It is unclear if chronic nipple stimulation from piercing alone can cause sustained elevations of serum prolactin. Nipple piercing is becoming a more mainstream societal form of body art, and answering this clinical question could potentially alter patient management.

Our aim was to assess serum prolactin levels in subjects with nipple piercings. Inclusion criteria were: men and women aged 18 years or older with nipple piercings present for more than six months. Exclusion criteria included: women who are pregnant, lactating, or less than six months postpartum; subjects on medications known to increase prolactin levels; those with chest wall or breast infection at the time of phlebotomy; or conditions known to be associated with hyperprolactinemia.

Three men and eight women were enrolled. The median ages for men and women were 33 (range 24–42) and 27 years (range 23–42), respectively. All except one subject had bilateral piercings. The median interval from nipple piercing to blood draw was 4.0 years (range 2.0–12.0). None of the subjects had hyperprolactinemia. The median prolactin levels were 5.6 ng/mL (range 3.8–7.4) for men and 8.0 ng/mL (range 2.8–10.9) for women. Our results suggest that in the absence of any concomitant infection, chronic nipple piercing is not associated with hyperprolactinemia.

### Accuracy of cyst versus solid diagnosis in the breast using quantitative transmission (QT) ultrasound [^114ZW7Pz]. Academic Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

When XRM identifies a lesion, or when a patient has symptoms such as a palpable lump, focal pain, or nipple discharge, handheld ultrasound (HHUS) is used as an adjunct to XRM for further evaluation. Additionally, HHUS or automated ultrasound may be used for secondary screening in patients with a normal, dense mammogram to improve the lower sensitivity for breast cancer detection seen with XRM alone in this subset of patients. However, when ultrasound is used to evaluate dense breasts, Gerson and Berg reported on the "risks of additional testing" and found that "two to six in 100 women who undergo screening sonography will require a breast aspiration or biopsy because of the sonogram". Additionally, "in as many as one out of 10 women, additional short-interval follow-up sonography (usually in 6 months) may be recommended because of the screening sonogram". In Daly et al, only 1 out of 243 lesions (complicated cysts) was found to be malignant. These studies highlight the problem that using adjunctive ultrasound in these situations identifies more benign lesions, without providing the specificity required to prevent these benign lesions from requiring additional imaging and procedures. Because cysts are the most common breast lesion, with estimated frequency between 50% and 90%, and because they are benign with only a 0.23% risk of malignancy for complicated cysts, no further work-up is needed. Berg et al. also indicated that false positives will be substantially increased with the addition of ultrasound screening.

### Identification of microRNAs in nipple discharge as potential diagnostic biomarkers for breast cancer [^115x2PX1]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2015). Low credibility.

Intraductal breast cancer is generally difficult to diagnose due to the lack of efficient detection methods. This study aimed to reveal and validate the differential expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) in nipple discharge from patients with intraductal papilloma and identify miRNAs as novel potential biomarkers for primary breast cancer.

- **Methods**: Nipple discharge samples were collected from three intraductal carcinoma patients and three intraductal papilloma patients. Initial screening of miRNA expression was performed using an Axon GenePix 4000B microarray scanner with a novel miRNA labeling approach. The expression levels of miRNAs selected from the initial screening were further examined using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) in 21 validation samples, comprising 8 carcinomas and 13 benign tumors. An independent t-test was used to detect significant correlations between miRNA expression levels and breast cancer.

- **Results**: Microarray profiling demonstrated that three miRNAs were markedly up-regulated and three miRNAs down-regulated in intraductal carcinoma patients compared to the papilloma group. The qRT-PCR analysis further verified that four miRNAs (miR-4484, miR-K12–5–5p, miR-3646, and miR-4732–5p) might serve as potential tumor biomarkers for breast cancer detection.

- **Conclusion**: The novel approach of using a microarray scanner is applicable for studying biomarkers in nipple discharge containing small amounts of miRNA. miRNAs could serve as potential tumor biomarkers that can assist in the diagnosis of breast cancer.

### Aso authors reflection: Diagnostic accuracy of nipple discharge fluid cytology: A meta-analysis and systematic review of the literature [^116VVYAU]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

Nipple discharge is the third most frequent complaint of women attending a breast clinic. Spontaneous single-duct, blood-stained discharge is widely accepted as a clinical sign warranting further investigation, in the form of imaging, cytology, and often diagnostic surgery. Nipple smear cytology remains the single most utilized diagnostic modality for the investigation of fluid content, although little is known about its overall diagnostic accuracy.

### Can molecular breast imaging with Tc-99m sestamibi safely rule out malignancy in pathologic nipple discharge [^114umWbK]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Nipple discharge is the third most common breast-related complaint, after pain and palpable breast mass. Nipple discharge can be characterized as physiological or pathologic. Physiological nipple discharge is often provoked, originates from multiple ducts, is bilateral, and may present with white, green, or yellow colors. It is rarely associated with cancer (0.3%). On the other hand, pathologic nipple discharge (PND) has at least one of the following features: spontaneous, unilateral secretion, discharge from a single duct, being persistent, and sometimes serous or bloody. Generally, PND has a benign cause, such as intraductal papilloma/papillomatosis (35%–48%) and duct ectasia (17%–36%). The rate of malignancy in PND is around 11%–16%.

The clinical workup in patients with nipple discharge should include a detailed clinical history and physical examination that directs the need for breast imaging. Usually, both mammography (MG) and ultrasound (US) are used to rule out an underlying malignancy. Lesions are often retroareolar, small, completely intraductal, and lack calcification, which impedes the mammographic detection of pathologies in these patients, leading to decreased sensitivity, around 20–25%, compared with patients presenting with a palpable mass. The sensitivity and specificity of US for the detection of malignancy in patients presenting with PND ranges from 63%-100% and 73%–84%, respectively. Some practices also perform cytologic examination, ductography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the added value of MRI is uncertain in patients with PND.

### An update on multimodal imaging strategies for nipple discharge: from detection to decision [^114MPd1r]. Insights into Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

Nipple discharge cytology is performed by gently squeezing the areola and nipple to collect the discharge, which is then spread onto a glass slide. Although the procedure is simple, it may not yield results if there is no discharge during the examination.

Currently, there is no international classification system for nipple smear cytology, unlike breast fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). Patients with nipple discharge usually undergo a triple assessment consisting of clinical examination, breast imaging, and pathological analysis, often involving nipple discharge cytology. However, nipple smear cytology has limited diagnostic accuracy in ruling out malignancy, demonstrating poor sensitivity (11%–34.6%) but high specificity (81%–100%) in detecting malignancy in patients with nipple discharge. In addition, some studies report a false-negative rate of up to 65%. As a result, some experts advise against the routine use of cytology in the workup of nipple discharge.

### Multimodality approach to the nipple-areolar complex: A pictorial review and diagnostic algorithm [^116jNFgU]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

The nipple-areolar complex is a region of the breast with unique characteristics. It is composed of diverse cells and specific tissues whose main function is to facilitate the drainage and secretion of breast milk during lactation. A wide variety of abnormal conditions can affect the nipple-areolar complex, including developmental abnormalities, benign processes (e.g. inflammation, infection, tumors), and invasive and noninvasive cancers.

Many of these conditions have nonspecific clinical and radiological presentations that can delay diagnosis, so evaluating the nipple-areolar complex represents a challenge for radiologists. A detailed history and clinical examination are essential to guide the radiological management of the nipple-areolar complex. Recognizing the different clinical signs that can manifest in the nipple-areolar complex (e.g. skin involvement, pathological nipple discharge, retraction, inversion, palpable mass, etc) is the first step in ensuring effective radiological management.

Imaging studies play an important role in diagnosing conditions of the nipple-areolar complex. Since this is a mobile, superficial region, it requires a specific approach to imaging evaluation. A meticulous radiological technique is fundamental to avoid artifacts and pitfalls. Furthermore, a multimodality approach is essential. The retroareolar region is difficult to evaluate in mammograms, so disease often goes undetected. For this reason, other techniques such as ultrasound (US) and even magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are necessary to reach the diagnosis.

### High-risk lesions of the breast: Concurrent diagnostic tools and management recommendations [^113nSHWF]. Insights Into Imaging (2021). Low credibility.

Diagnosis: Papillomas can be asymptomatic and detected at routine breast screening. However, when symptomatic, they can present as a palpable mass near the nipple or with bloody nipple discharge in up to 20–50% of cases, often due to pedicle torsion.

Mammography is limited due to poor sensitivity and specificity. When visible, mammographic findings are represented by asymmetric areas of increased density, dilated ducts, or solitary lesions with associated microcalcifications. Since the features of papillary lesions at mammography can be non-specific, the main role of this technique is the detection of microcalcifications that can be suspicious and related to papillary malignant lesions.

- **Breast ultrasound**: A valuable tool in the diagnosis of papillomas, whether using conventional ultrasound, Doppler ultrasound, or elastography. Ultrasound may demonstrate a solid, round mass; a mass with well-defined borders; an intra-cystic mass; or a hypo-echoic, well-defined mass in a dilated duct. The fibrovascular stalk of papillomas can be further assessed with color or power Doppler ultrasound.

- **Elastography**: Employed to show increased stiffness of the papillomas.

The utility of these concurrent diagnostic tools underscores their significance in determining the nature and management of high-risk breast lesions.

### Unilateral nipple discharge in a man without a palpable mass diagnosed as breast cancer [^116Jv2M3]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

A 69-year-old man without a family history of breast cancer presented to his primary care physician with a 1-year history of clear, unilateral nipple discharge (ND) without an associated palpable breast mass. His laboratory findings were significant for hyperprolactinemia at 28 ng/mL. Diagnostic work-up, including mammography, ultrasound, and core needle biopsy, ultimately revealed a ductal carcinoma in situ and a rare papillary variant of invasive ductal carcinoma. The patient was referred to a multidisciplinary oncology team and underwent a right total mastectomy followed by adjuvant hormonal therapy. The patient made a good postoperative recovery and remains without evidence of recurrence 6 months from surgery. Male breast cancer is rare, but its incidence is increasing. Male breast cancer presenting as ND without a palpable mass is uncommon. Early recognition of breast symptoms in men can lead to earlier diagnoses and improved outcomes.

### An update on multimodal imaging strategies for nipple discharge: from detection to decision [^116tAPkj]. Insights into Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

- **Causes of pathological nipple discharge**: Nipple discharge is usually attributed to benign conditions, with the main causes being intraductal papilloma and duct ectasia. Other benign entities that may present as pathological nipple discharge are periductal or plasma cell mastitis, fibrocystic changes, nipple adenoma, epidermal inclusion cysts in the areolar region, syringomatous tumours of the nipple, and retroareolar cysts in adolescents.

- **Intraductal papilloma**: Papillary lesions are a heterogeneous group that includes both benign and malignant lesions. The most frequent cause of nipple discharge is intraductal papilloma (IP), accounting for 36.8% to 57% of cases. Pathologically, IP is a benign mass-like projection consisting of papillary fronds attached to the inner mammary duct wall by a fibrovascular core, lined by epithelial and myoepithelial cells.

	- IP can be classified as solitary or multiple and as central or peripheral. Solitary papillomas are usually central, arising in the ducts in the retroareolar region. These tumours commonly affect perimenopausal women and are usually associated with nipple discharge. In contrast, peripheral papillomas are usually multiple, arise in the terminal ductal lobular units, and occur in younger patients. Peripheral papillomas are more often associated with malignancy than solitary IP.

### 3.0 tesla breast magnetic resonance imaging in patients with nipple discharge when mammography and ultrasound fail [^11621fJR]. European radiology (2015). Low credibility.

To compare 3.0 Tesla breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with galactography for detection of benign and malignant causes of nipple discharge in patients with negative mammography and ultrasound, we prospectively evaluated 56 breasts of 50 consecutive patients. These patients, who exhibited nipple discharge, had inconspicuous mammography and ultrasound results. The study employed 3.0 Tesla breast MRI utilizing a dedicated 16-channel breast coil and subsequently compared the findings with results from galactography. Histopathological diagnoses and follow-ups were used as the reference standard. The lesion size estimated via MRI was compared with the size determined by histopathology.

Sensitivity and specificity of MRI versus galactography for detecting pathological findings were 95.7% versus 85.7% and 69.7% versus 33.3%, respectively. For the supposed concrete pathology based on MRI findings, the specificity was 67.6% and the sensitivity 77.3% (PPV 60.7%, NPV 82.1%). Eight malignant lesions were detected, accounting for 14.8% of cases. The estimated size of lesions determined by breast MRI showed excellent correlation with the size obtained from histopathology (Pearson's correlation coefficient 0.95, p < 0.0001).

MRI of the breast at 3.0 Tesla is an accurate imaging test and can replace galactography in the workup of nipple discharge in patients with inconspicuous mammography and ultrasound.

- **Key points**: Breast MRI is an excellent diagnostic tool for patients with nipple discharge. MRI of the breast reveals malignant lesions despite inconspicuous mammography and ultrasound. MRI of the breast has greater sensitivity and specificity than galactography. The modality shows excellent correlation with histopathological findings.

### Surgical decision making and factors determining a diagnosis of breast carcinoma in women presenting with nipple discharge [^112sA3vV]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2003). Low credibility.

There is no consensus about the use of the various diagnostic tests and surgical procedures available to confirm or rule out breast cancer in patients presenting with nipple discharge. This study was designed to identify patient and nipple-discharge characteristics associated with the diagnosis of breast cancer, and to determine the utility of mammography, sonography, ductography, and cytology in surgical decision-making in patients presenting with pathologic nipple discharge.

- **Study design**: We reviewed the medical records of all patients who presented with nipple discharge at our institution between August 1993 and September 2000. Patient and nipple-discharge characteristics and findings on imaging studies and cytologic examination were analyzed.

- **Results**: A total of 146 patients presented at our institution with nipple discharge during the study period. Of these, 52 had clinically benign discharge and were managed without surgical intervention; 94 patients had pathologic discharge and underwent a biopsy procedure for histologic diagnosis, treatment, or both. Logistic regression analysis identified mammographic (relative risk [RR] = 10.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.36 to 46.39, p = 0.0002) and sonographic (RR = 5.54, 95% CI 1.27 to 25.40, p = 0.028) abnormalities as independent factors associated with a malignant diagnosis. Nineteen cancers, 62 papillomas, and 13 other benign lesions were identified among the patients with pathologic discharge. In three patients with cancer (15.8%) and 30 patients with a papilloma (48.4%), ductography was the only means of identification.

### Differences in diagnosis and treatment of nipple conditions of reproductive-age women at a tertiary health system [^114SMGKc]. Journal of Women's Health (2023). Low credibility.

Nipple-areolar complex (NAC) conditions affect reproductive-age women, yet it is not known how care of NAC complaints is distributed among medical specialties. There is a need to characterize all NAC conditions, including their treatment and the care team involved in their clinical management, of nonlactating and lactating patients to determine care gaps.

- **Materials and methods**: This was a retrospective cohort study of reproductive-age females who presented to a large tertiary health system with an NAC complaint between 2015 and 2020. Data about the symptoms, diagnosis, specialty providing care, diagnostic considerations, and treatments were collected.

- **Results**: Nipple pain, dermatitis, and thrush were the most common diagnoses among 407 encounters (215 patients). Lactating patients represented half (204, 50%) of the study sample. Benign breast conditions like obstructed ductal openings, accessory nipples, nipple growth, inverted nipples, and chronic and bacterial infections represented a third of all encounters. Primary care physicians (167, 41%) and obstetricians (105, 26%) provided most of the care and referred a third and a quarter of patients, respectively, to another provider. The care of patients with NAC complaints is not limited to obstetricians. Internal medicine, family medicine, emergency medicine, and obstetrician-gynecology, dermatology, and surgery resident physicians should receive training in benign breast conditions and clinical lactation.

### Pathologic nipple discharge: Surgery is imperative in postmenopausal women [^115uhVhr]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2005). Low credibility

A total of 10% to 15% of pathologic nipple discharge in women is due to malignant lesions of the breast. The purpose of this study was to discover the rate of breast cancer in women who present with this symptom and undergo ductal excision, to evaluate the different diagnostic methods used before surgery, and to discover whether there are specific factors with regard to dignity.

- **Methods**: We analyzed 118 ductal excisions in 116 patients performed at the women's hospital of the University of Rostock, Germany, between 1995 and 2002. The discharging duct was identified by preoperative galactography.

- **Results**: The rate of cancer in these patients was 9.3% (n = 11). The most frequent benign lesion was intraductal papillomatous proliferation (36.4%; n = 43). Solitary papillomas were shown in 21.2% (n = 25), and other specific benign histologic findings were shown in 27.1% (n = 32). Women with malignancies were significantly older (P = 0.009) and were more often postmenopausal (P = 0.095) compared with patients with benign histology. Galactography was the method that reached the highest sensitivity (73%), and clinical examination showed the highest specificity (85%) in distinguishing between benign and malignant lesions.

- **Conclusions**: Because 94.1% of all cases presented with specific histological findings causing pathologic nipple discharge, ductal excision combined with preoperative galactography was proven to be a sufficient method for diagnosis and therapy. This procedure should be performed in all postmenopausal women with this symptom because of a cancer rate of 12%.

### An update on multimodal imaging strategies for nipple discharge: From detection to decision [^11536fFs]. Insights into Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

Malignant causes associated with nipple discharge are mainly due to ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), which accounts for up to 86% of cases. Most patients with breast carcinoma who present with pathological nipple discharge (PND) have early-stage cancer, usually DCIS or stage I disease. Paget disease associated with DCIS may also present as nipple discharge.

Although nipple discharge is uncommon in men, it is associated with breast cancer in 23%–57% of cases. Therefore, nipple discharge in men should always be considered a suspicious finding.

- **Figure 8**: Breast cancer in a man with nipple discharge:
	- A 73-year-old man with gynecomastia and right bloody PND.
	- Craniocaudal low-energy contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) images showing diffuse bilateral gynecomastia.
	- Craniocaudal recombined CEM images revealing a non-mass-like enhancement distributed segmentally in the retroareolar region of the right breast (discontinuous lines).
	- Ultrasound identifies an intraductal solid mass (arrowheads). Initial ultrasound-guided biopsy showed a fibroepithelial lesion without atypia, leading to surveillance. One year later, persistent discharge prompted re-evaluation.
	- Right craniocaudal low-energy CEM image shows a displaced post-biopsy clip (arrow).
	- Recombined CEM image shows a slight enlargement of the pathological enhancement (discontinuous lines).
	- Ultrasound reveals duct wall irregularity associated with the intraductal lesion (arrowheads). An ultrasound-guided vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB) confirmed malignancy. The patient underwent mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Final histological analysis revealed invasive ductal carcinoma with DCIS and encapsulated papillary carcinoma.

### Primary squamous cell carcinoma of the nipple: A diagnosis of suspicion [^113xiFJt]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

There has been only one documented case in the English literature with the diagnosis of primary squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the nipple; we present a further case of a primary SCC of the nipple, thus raising awareness among skin or breast specialists of this possible presentation for SCC. We present the case of a 34-year-old lady who presented to our plastic surgery unit with an erythematous, scaly lesion on her right nipple areola complex (NAC). The lesion was histologically confirmed on biopsy to be an SCC and was subsequently formally excised. Histology confirmed complete excision of the lesion with adequate margins, with no lymphovascular or perineural invasion.

This case report describes a rare presentation of a primary moderately differentiated SCC of the nipple. Although SCC of the nipple is a rare diagnosis, in view of its similar presentation to Paget's disease of the nipple, it must be considered, and careful examination of the histology must be performed to ascertain a definitive diagnosis. Patients presenting with lesions of the NAC cannot be assumed to have either Paget's disease or SCC, and a biopsy should be performed before arranging further investigations or treatment, as the pathways for the two conditions can be very different.

### Diagnostic accuracy of nipple discharge fluid cytology: A meta-analysis and systematic review of the literature [^117RbDvE]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

For the initial review, 837 studies were retrieved from the databases (PRISMA diagram; Supplement 1; Fig. 1). After reviewing abstracts and titles, 213 studies met the inclusion criteria for a full-text review; 168 studies were excluded. The main reasons for exclusion were: no English translation of the article (n = 70), lack of nipple discharge cytology data (n = 45), abstract only (n = 15), nipple discharge cytology data without gold standard comparison (n = 14), duplication of the dataset (n = 12), and merging of fine-needle aspirate cytology and nipple smear cytology (n = 7). Other exclusions ruled out patients not presenting exclusively with nipple discharge (n = 2), ductal lavage cytology with no simple nipple discharge cytology (n = 2), paper not available (n = 2), nipple aspirate fluid cytology rather than nipple discharge cytology (n = 2), case report (n = 1), and heterogeneous analysis of both male and female cytology data (n = 1).

### Bloody nipple discharge in a 7-month-old boy [^116WGQaw]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Isolated bloody nipple discharge is rare in infancy and is typically idiopathic. The discharge commonly resolves spontaneously, and ultrasonography is a useful diagnostic technique to detect the cause of the discharge. The authors report a case of a 7-month-old boy who presented with unilateral spontaneous bloody nipple discharge for one month without signs of infection or mass.

### Diagnostic accuracy of nipple discharge fluid cytology: A meta-analysis and systematic review of the literature [^114V4Mkr]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

Pooled data from the included studies demonstrated that the diagnostic accuracy of nipple discharge cytology is limited and has poor sensitivity for symptomatic women. The color of nipple discharge fluid, although yielding a high positive malignancy rate, demonstrated a poor positive predictive value (PPV). Emerging technologies for the analysis of nipple fluid must have a higher diagnostic accuracy than nipple cytology while offering advantages in terms of cost, reproducibility, user dependency, and turnaround time.

### Common breast problems [^116VBFXx]. American Family Physician (2019). Low credibility.

Palpable breast masses, mastalgia, and nipple discharge are commonly encountered symptoms in outpatient practice, causing significant patient anxiety and precipitating medical consultation. The initial workup includes a detailed clinical history and physical examination. Women presenting with a breast mass require imaging and further assessment to exclude cancer. Diagnostic mammography is usually preferred, but ultrasonography is more sensitive in women younger than 30 years. Any suspicious mass detected on physical examination, mammography, or ultrasonography should undergo biopsy. In most cases, a core needle biopsy is performed with imaging guidance for evaluation of a suspicious mass.

Mastalgia is usually not an indication of underlying malignancy. Oral contraceptives, hormone therapy, some psychotropic drugs, and some cardiovascular agents have been associated with mastalgia. Focal breast pain should be evaluated with diagnostic imaging. Targeted ultrasonography localized to discrete areas of the breast can be used alone to evaluate focal breast pain in women younger than 30 years and as an adjunct to mammography in women 30 years and older. Topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as diclofenac, are a first-line treatment option.

The first step in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with nipple discharge is the classification of the discharge as pathologic or physiologic. Nipple discharge is classified as pathologic if it is spontaneous, bloody, unilateral, or associated with a breast mass.

### Cytology of spontaneous nipple discharge — is it worth it? Performance of nipple discharge preparations in the College of American Pathologists Interlaboratory Comparison Program in nongynecologic cytopathology [^114VQmZs]. Archives of Pathology & Laboratory Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The usefulness of spontaneous nipple discharge analysis is controversial. Nipple discharge preparations are rare in clinical practice, and malignant cases are exceptional. The College of American Pathologists Interlaboratory Comparison Program in Nongynecologic Cytopathology has included nipple discharge preparations since its inception.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate participant responses in the College of American Pathologists Interlaboratory Comparison Program in Nongynecologic Cytopathology to assess the accuracy of cytologic interpretation of nipple discharge preparation.

- **Design**: General diagnostic category (benign, suspicious, malignant), participant type (pathologist, cytotechnologist), stain (Papanicolaou, modified Giemsa), and program year (2005–2009) were analyzed using χ² and a nonlinear mixed model for slide factor correlation structure.

- **Results**: Of 2506 responses, 1280 (51%) were malignant, 171 (7%) were papillary, and 1055 (42%) were benign. There were 222 discordant general category responses with a false-positive/suspicious rate of 12.8% and a false-negative rate of 3.4%. The most common false-negative diagnosis was mastitis/abscess (125 of 1272 responses; 9.8%). The most common false-positive response was papillary lesion (26 of 457 responses; 5.7%). There were no differences between stains or years. Cytotechnologists performed better than pathologists; pathologists had a higher false-negative rate than cytotechnologists (15.3% versus 7.9%, P < .001).

- **Conclusions**: There is poor accuracy in evaluating nipple discharge preparation in the College of American Pathologists Interlaboratory Comparison Program.

### Bloody nipple discharge in an infant and a proposed diagnostic approach [^116rBJvZ]. Pediatrics (2006). Low credibility.

Bloody nipple discharge is a rare finding in infants and is associated most often with benign mammary duct ectasia. The rarity of this symptom in infants and its association with breast carcinoma in adults can lead to unnecessary investigation and treatment. Here we describe a 4-month-old boy with bilateral bloody nipple discharge that resolved spontaneously without treatment by 6 months of age. Furthermore, we propose a strategic method for the evaluation of such infants.

### Breast ductography: To do or not to do? A pictorial essay [^1179kNir]. Insights into Imaging (2023). Low credibility.

Nipple discharge is a frequent clinical presentation of breast disease. Although most cases are physiologic, pathologic nipple discharge is not uncommon. Eight to 15% of pathological nipple discharge is associated with malignancy, requiring investigation. Some specialists believe that ductography is a challenging procedure better substituted by other methods, such as MRI. However, an experienced physician can perform ductography quickly and easily, and it still plays an essential role in certain clinical scenarios.

Conventional imaging, such as mammography and sonography, commonly fails to detect the underlying causes of pathological nipple discharge. Meanwhile, MRI has limitations in terms of specificity, cost, lengthy exam duration, and patient factors like claustrophobia. Combining ductography with other methods, such as ultrasound-guided or stereotactic biopsy, can lead to specific diagnoses and appropriate treatment.

The study aims to present the ductography technique, possible findings, and the clinical settings where it is useful:

- **Critical relevance statement**: Although ductography is currently less used in breast imaging, it still plays an essential role in certain clinical scenarios. These scenarios include pathological nipple discharge with negative conventional imaging, contraindicated MRI, unavailable MRI, unremarkable MRI results, and multiple MRI findings.

- **Key points**: Conventional imaging commonly fails to detect the underlying causes of pathological nipple discharge. MRI, in the setting of nipple discharge, also presents challenges.

### Diagnostic accuracy of nipple discharge fluid cytology: A meta-analysis and systematic review of the literature [^112QgaGW]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

Methods:

An electronic search using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and SCOPUS was performed until March 2020. Multiple methods were used to retrieve papers, including submitting requests through the authors' academic institution and the British Library, writing to the editor of the journal, contacting the corresponding author, and placing requests through ResearchGate.

Search terms included "nipple discharge fluid" and "cytology" in all their forms. The following Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and keywords were used in combination with AND/OR operators: "nipple discharge" OR "breast" adjacent to "discharge" by up to three words OR "nipple" adjacent to "discharge" by up to three words AND cytodiagnosis OR cytoproliferation OR cytolog* OR cytodiagnos* OR papanicolaou. Title and abstract review was performed according to the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria defined in the following sections.

- **Inclusion criteria**: Only clinical studies with primary data on the diagnostic accuracy of nipple discharge fluid cytology versus ductal histology were included. Foreign language studies were included if an English language translation was retrievable. Studies were included if they yielded diagnostic information on benign and/or malignant diagnoses from cytology and on pathologic nipple discharge of all clinical descriptions (i.e. single duct, blood-stained, clear). Regarding acquisition of fluid, studies that included direct expression of discharge as well as ductoscopy to retrieve a fluid sample were included if patients presented with pathologic nipple discharge.

- **Exclusion criteria**:

### Charged with discharge: A case-based review of nipple discharge using the American College of Radiology's appropriateness guidelines [^111AtwfA]. Journal of Breast Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Nipple discharge, a relatively common presenting symptom for women of all ages, may be due to both benign and malignant conditions. Men can also present with nipple discharge, and when they do, they have a higher likelihood of malignancy than women. Radiologists vary in their evaluation of patients with nipple discharge. However, the American College of Radiology practice guidelines for nipple discharge provide data-driven appropriate algorithms.

In patients with physiologic discharge, imaging is not typically indicated. For those with pathologic nipple discharge, imaging typically starts with diagnostic mammography and retroareolar ultrasound for women over 40 years of age; a diagnostic mammogram or ultrasound is recommended for women aged 30–39 years, and ultrasound for women younger than 30 years. Finally, contrast-enhanced breast MRI or galactography is usually reserved for identifying the cause of discharge when initial imaging with mammography and ultrasound is unrevealing.

### An update on multimodal imaging strategies for nipple discharge: From detection to decision [^1156WNSp]. Insights into Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

- **Imaging techniques**: Diagnostic breast imaging is not necessary for physiological nipple discharge. However, when pathological nipple discharge (PND) is suspected, an initial imaging evaluation with full-field digital mammography (FFDM) and ultrasound (US) is normally carried out.

- **Mammography**: According to the American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria for the evaluation of nipple discharge, the first-line imaging technique in women aged 40 years or older is either FFDM or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), usually complemented by US. For women aged 30 to 39 years, the ACR supports the use of either FFDM/DBT or US as the initial imaging modality, depending on institutional preference and individual patient factors. While the incidence of breast cancer before the age of 40 years is low — approximately 7% — some experts recommend US as the initial imaging assessment in this age group to minimize the cumulative risk of malignancy from ionizing radiation. FFDM/DBT may be added only if risk factors for breast cancer are present or if malignancy is suspected based on US findings. Furthermore, in symptomatic women aged 30 to 39 years, US has higher sensitivity than FFDM (95.7% versus 60.9%).

### Diagnostic accuracy of nipple discharge fluid cytology: A meta-analysis and systematic review of the literature [^113ye9MB]. Annals of Surgical Oncology (2022). Low credibility.

Moreover, our review suggests that no single diagnostic technique can be used in isolation, even amid these changing times, with the need to minimize hospital appointments and unnecessary surgery. It does, however, suggest scope for the development of a more comprehensive diagnostic tool to assess nipple discharge. With the explosion of metabolomics during the last decade yielding promising results, the interrogation of tiny amounts of fluid such as nipple discharge fluid using newer technology must be investigated, with awareness of the need for high diagnostic accuracy, fast turnaround time, and reproducibility.

The great strength of this meta-analysis was its comprehensive review of nipple cytology diagnostics toward pooled diagnostic accuracy. The decision to include cytology papers from such a large time span was intended to reflect the longevity of the technique's use and its diagnostic accuracy in the context of evolving diagnostic practices. Moreover, this is the first review to interrogate the use of nipple smear cytology to detect both benign and malignant breast disease and to compare its performance with that of other breast imaging methods.

The most recently published comparable review by Filipe et al. considers only malignant diagnostics and independently compares other imaging methods for which only histopathology is available. In addition, their study overlooked literature from which guidelines were drawn. Comparing other imaging methods and cytology within the same patient cohorts reduces patient selection bias and therefore reflects more accurately on the diagnostic processes.

### An update on multimodal imaging strategies for nipple discharge: from detection to decision [^115F1Da9]. Insights into Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

Multiple intraductal papillomas with malignant upgrade to DCIS are presented. A 48-year-old woman with a personal history of right breast intraductal papilloma surgery and bloody PND in the same breast was subject to investigation. Her cytology was negative. The synthesised 2-dimensional mammogram showed retroareolar coarse heterogeneous calcifications (square) and a clip from a prior benign biopsy (circle). Recombined CEM images displayed differential contrast enhancement near the calcifications (square) and segmental non-mass-like enhancement (NME) in the outer quadrants (discontinuous lines). An ultrasound demonstrated a retroareolar solid intraductal lesion with calcifications; ultrasound-guided VAB was negative. Tomosynthesis-guided VAB of the retroareolar calcifications and CEM-guided VAB of the NME revealed multiple intraductal papillomas and atypical ductal hyperplasia in the latter. The patient underwent a right mastectomy. The histology of the specimen showed several papillomas (stars), consisting of benign intraductal proliferations with branching fibrovascular cores lined by epithelial and myoepithelial cells, and DCIS (arrow), a neoplastic intraductal epithelial proliferation with cytological and architectural atypia.

Central IP is usually occult on mammography, unless the lesion is sufficiently large to be visualised or contains calcifications. On US, it may appear as an intraductal mass, usually associated with duct dilatation, an intracystic mass, or a solid mass with well-defined margins.

### Male ductal carcinoma (DCIS) at a young age [^112zW3w8]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

In this case, a man in his late 20s visited his general practitioner with unilateral left nipple discharge. Initially, he was treated with antibiotics, and the nipple discharge stopped. When the discharge recurred following a few weeks, the patient was referred to the multidisciplinary breast centre in UZ Leuven. Clinical examination revealed an otherwise healthy but obese man (body mass index of 31 kg/m²). On examination, we were able to evacuate bloody discharge from a single duct by mild compression of the left nipple. The bilateral mammography and ultrasound showed an irregular retroareolar density of 40×50 mm with adjacent, multiple clustered microcalcifications over a total distance of 20 mm on the left side. The histopathological report after core needle biopsy revealed a poorly differentiated ductal carcinoma in situ. Genetic testing for hereditary breast-ovarian cancer genes was negative. A simple left mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy was performed. There was no indication for adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy, nor for adjuvant endocrine therapy.

### Bloody nipple discharge due to intraductal papilloma in an adolescent girl [^117N3BPz]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

An early adolescent girl was referred to our breast surgery clinic with multiple right-sided breast masses and several months of unilateral bloody nipple discharge. MRI demonstrated multiple enhancing masses in the right breast with intrinsic hypertensive T1 signal of the ducts extending to the nipple. A biopsy showed partially sclerosed intraductal papillomas without atypia or malignancy. Following extensive counselling with the patient and her family, two palpable breast masses and a single central breast duct responsible for bloody nipple discharge were fully excised. Histopathological analysis showed unique overlapping features resembling intraductal papilloma, nipple adenoma, and fibroadenomas. The patient has had resolution of her bloody nipple discharge and excellent cosmetic outcomes post-surgery. Intraductal papilloma is rare in the adolescent population, and the risk of future malignancy is not well established. Thus, a tailored approach to the work-up and management of paediatric breast masses is essential.

### Skin diseases of the breast and nipple: Inflammatory and infectious diseases [^1112Bfzt]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2019). High credibility.

Certain dermatologic conditions are unique to the breast and nipple, whereas others may incidentally involve these structures. All require a nuanced approach to diagnosis and treatment because of the functional, sexual, and aesthetic importance of this area. The lactating patient requires special management because certain treatment options are contraindicated. All dermatologic conditions involving the breast and nipple require careful evaluation because malignancy of the breast can be mistaken for a benign condition or may trigger the development of certain dermatologic conditions.

The second article in this continuing medical education series reviews common and uncommon inflammatory and infectious conditions of the breast and nipple, and provides insight into both the diagnosis and treatment of this heterogeneous group of diseases. For the purposes of this article, these conditions are divided into four distinct categories:

1. **Dermatitis**: This encompasses a variety of inflammatory conditions affecting the breast and nipple.
2. **Radiation-induced changes**: These changes occur due to previous treatments and may impact the skin's appearance and function.
3. **Mastitis**: An infection often seen in lactating women but not limited to them.
4. **Miscellaneous dermatologic conditions of the breast and nipple**: This category includes various other conditions that do not fit into the previous categories.

Each category requires specific attention and a tailored treatment approach.

### Multimodality approach to the nipple-areolar complex: A pictorial review and diagnostic algorithm [^116Zw7gv]. Insights into Imaging (2020). Low credibility.

Syringomatous tumor of the nipple, also called infiltrating syringomatous adenoma, is an extremely rare benign lesion originating in the eccrine glands of the skin of the nipple and areola. Clinically, it presents as a subareolar nodule, occasionally painful. It can cause nipple discharge or retraction, and in rare cases, is associated with ulceration and erosion of the nipple. Although benign, syringomatous adenomas are locally invasive and often mimic a malignant lesion on imaging tests.

On mammography, it is usually seen as an irregular hyperdense mass in the subareolar region, although it can also present as pleomorphic calcifications in the nipple. Ultrasound reveals an ill-defined subareolar mass with heterogeneous echoes inside (Fig. 27).

- **Fig. 27**: Syringomatous tumor of the nipple. A 47-year-old woman with retraction and hardening of the left nipple.
	- a. Mammogram shows retraction of the left nipple and asymmetric retroareolar density.
	- b. On ultrasound, the lesion is solid and hypoechogenic with ill-defined borders and increased peripheral color-Doppler signal.
	- c. Contrast-enhanced coronal T1-weighted MRI (subtracted image obtained 120 s after contrast injection) shows mass-type uptake with pronounced early enhancement in a lesion with hazy borders that retracts the nipple-areolar complex.
	- d. Hematoxylin-eosin stain (×4) shows a proliferation of elongated glandular structures like strings of cells in the dermis, with the formation of keratin cysts (star).

The diagnosis of syringomatous adenomas is based on the histologic appearance of the lesion and its restriction to the dermis.

### Nipple discharge imaging evaluation with mammography, ultrasound, galactography, and MRI [^116iELbS]. Academic Radiology (2023). High credibility.

To determine the diagnostic yield of various imaging tests used to evaluate nipple discharge, a single institution, IRB-approved, retrospective study was performed on 320 consecutive patients presenting with nipple discharge. Imaging and pathology were reviewed to determine the yield for malignancy, atypical high-risk lesions (HRLs), and intraductal papillomas (IDPs).

- **Results**: Of the 320 patients, pathology or follow-up confirmed 40 breast malignancies (40/320, 12.5%), 14 atypical HRLs (14/320, 4.4%), 71 IDPs (71/320, 22.2%), 48 other benign pathologies (48/320, 15.0%), and 147 unknown but benign cases (147/320, 45.9%). Physiologic discharge characteristics were observed in a minority of malignant cases: nonspontaneous (4/40, 10.0%); neither bloody nor clear (4/40, 10.0%); bilateral (3/40, 7.5%). Malignancy was associated with older age (p < 0.001) and bloody discharge (odds ratio 6.5, p < 0.0001). The combination of digital mammography and ultrasound had a 93% sensitivity and a 98% NPV, while contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) had a 100% sensitivity and a 100% NPV for malignancy. Only three galactography examinations were performed among the malignant cohort, with minimal contribution (1 of 3) to the diagnostic evaluation. In this case, galactography findings helped determine imaging-pathology discordance, prompting a recommendation for surgical excision and subsequently a malignant diagnosis.

- **Conclusion**: The combination of mammography and ultrasonography detected 93% of breast malignancies associated with nipple discharge.

### Indicators of breast cancer in patients undergoing microdochectomy for a pathological nipple discharge in a middle-income country [^113ioJ4R]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2017). Low credibility.

The management of a pathological nipple discharge often involves surgery to exclude a malignant etiology. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of cancer in patients who had microdochectomy for pathological nipple discharge in a South African population and to evaluate patients' demographics and clinical characteristics as indicators of underlying cancer, making recommendations for management in resource-limited settings.

- **Materials and methods**: Clinical, radiological, and histological data from 153 patients who underwent a microdochectomy for a pathological nipple discharge at two South African breast clinics were collected.

- **Results**: Invasive or in situ cancer was found in 12 patients (7.84%), and in all cases, cancer was associated with a bloody nipple discharge. Bloody discharge had a sensitivity of 100% in indicating cancer, a specificity of 55.32%, a positive predictive value of 16%, and a negative predictive value of 100%. Patients with breast cancer were also more likely to be aged 55 years or older (P = 0.04). Preoperative mammogram and ultrasound were poor in detecting cancer (0/12).

- **Conclusions**: In our population, a bloody discharge in women aged 55 years or older should mandate a microdochectomy, with selective surgery for younger women and those with nonbloody discharges. Thorough clinical examination to determine the true color and nature of the discharge is vital in the initial assessment of these patients. Preoperative radiology is not helpful in determining the presence of cancer in an isolated pathological nipple discharge.
