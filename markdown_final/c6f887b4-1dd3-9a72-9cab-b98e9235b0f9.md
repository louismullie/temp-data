## Question

Best med for acute anxiety

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medication is best for acute anxiety. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "acute anxiety" means clinically and in different settings. Then, I should verify the highest-quality guideline recommendations. Next, I will review comparative efficacy and safety data across classes, including benzodiazepines, SSRIs/SNRIs, and alternatives. After that, I need to consider special populations and contexts. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk–benefit recommendation and note what would change my conclusion if new evidence emerges.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame: "acute anxiety" can mean an acute episode of an anxiety disorder, severe situational anxiety (e.g., panic attack, trauma-related distress), or anxiety in medical settings such as the ICU, perioperative care, or acute coronary syndromes. The "best" choice depends on onset needed, duration of use, comorbidities, and safety context, so I should not jump to a single answer without anchoring to setting and goals [^2754805d] [^7dfb64fd] [^2981cf14] [^00fe1b21].

> Next, I should review the highest-credibility guidance. The WHO mhGAP update recommends SSRIs as first-line pharmacotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder, and advises against routine benzodiazepine use, reserving them for severe, acute anxiety symptoms for 3–7 days only, which signals a strong default toward SSRIs/SNRIs for sustained treatment and a very restricted role for benzodiazepines acutely [^2754805d] [^7dfb64fd]. The British Association for Psychopharmacology similarly lists SSRIs and SNRIs as first-line for acute treatment of GAD, with benzodiazepines as options for short-term relief, reinforcing the same hierarchy [^addff970] [^3f7c75f5]. The VA/DoD PTSD guideline recommends against benzodiazepines for PTSD due to lack of efficacy and potential harms, which cautions against reflex benzodiazepine use even when anxiety is severe [^746bdd13].

> Hold on, let's not conflate speed with superiority. Benzodiazepines work rapidly and can reduce somatic symptoms quickly, which is why they are used short-term in severe presentations, but I need to ensure I weigh dependence, withdrawal, cognitive effects, and misuse risk, especially with repeated dosing beyond a few days [^2754805d] [^82298f4e]. The FDA labeling for alprazolam and diazepam supports short-term use for acute anxiety, but explicitly notes that long-term effectiveness has not been established, which aligns with guideline cautions rather than endorsing routine use [^f240c0a7] [^fcb78ad5] [^f50d9391].

> I will now examine comparative efficacy. SSRIs and SNRIs have robust evidence for anxiety disorders with small-to-moderate effect sizes versus placebo, and meta-analytic data show no clear superiority among SSRIs/SNRIs, supporting class-based selection tailored to comorbidity and tolerability [^88e0f2df] [^0c773101]. For panic disorder, a network meta-analysis found benzodiazepines and several antidepressants outperform placebo, with benzodiazepines showing strong efficacy but also the highest risk of adverse events, whereas SSRIs like sertraline and escitalopram offered a better benefit–harm balance, which is clinically meaningful when choosing beyond the first week [^3bb02b23]. Wait, let me verify the tolerability claim: the same analysis noted benzodiazepines had lower dropout rates than some comparators, yet were associated with more adverse events, so the "balance" still favors SSRIs/SNRIs for ongoing care despite short-term tolerability trade-offs [^3bb02b23].

> Let me consider alternatives for rapid relief when benzodiazepines are undesirable. Ketamine shows rapid, transdiagnostic anxiolytic effects within hours with sustained benefit for 1–2 weeks in randomized trials, but the evidence base is smaller, risk of bias is high in many studies, and practical issues (monitoring, dissociation, abuse potential) limit routine use to specialized settings or research contexts rather than first-line community practice [^082bedbe] [^e919ac42]. Hydroxyzine has evidence for short-term GAD symptom reduction versus placebo, but sedation limits utility and guideline prominence, so it remains a niche option rather than a best-in-class acute agent [^51e5ef46]. Beta-blockers have not shown robust efficacy for anxiety disorders in meta-analyses, so they should not be considered first-line for acute anxiety beyond performance-related somatic symptoms [^e310c044].

> I should double-check special populations and contexts. In older adults, antidepressants are effective and generally safer than benzodiazepines, which carry higher risks of falls, cognitive impairment, and dependence; thus, SSRIs/SNRIs are preferred when medication is indicated, with careful dosing and monitoring [^f81b7fa7]. In children and adolescents, SSRIs are first-line pharmacotherapy for pediatric anxiety, and benzodiazepines are not recommended due to lack of supportive evidence and safety concerns, so the "best" acute strategy emphasizes SSRIs plus CBT rather than benzodiazepines [^c86a7d8c] [^7faf44c0]. In the ICU, contemporary guidelines conclude there is insufficient evidence to recommend benzodiazepines for anxiety, underscoring the need to prioritize nonpharmacologic measures and alternative sedatives with lighter cognitive footprints when possible [^00fe1b21] [^b9be08e3]. In acute coronary syndromes, cardiology guidance allows short-term benzodiazepines for severe anxiety, but this is a monitored, exceptional context rather than a generalizable approach [^2981cf14].

> But wait, what if the anxiety is a panic attack or trauma-related acute distress? For panic disorder, SSRIs remain first-line for sustained treatment, while short-course benzodiazepines can be used judiciously for immediate relief while initiating definitive therapy, with attention to withdrawal and functional impairment risks [^3bb02b23] [^2754805d]. For acute stress reactions, evidence for early pharmacologic prevention of PTSD is limited and uncertain, so benzodiazepines should be avoided outside of exceptional, short-term symptomatic use, and SSRIs are not preventive in this context based on current data [^dba2364a] [^746bdd13].

> Let me synthesize a practical answer, and I will keep checking for internal consistency. For most adults with an acute anxiety episode or the acute phase of an anxiety disorder, the best default is to start an SSRI or SNRI for definitive treatment while using nonpharmacologic strategies (CBT-based techniques, grounding, breathing) for immediate coping, recognizing onset is 2–4 weeks and that dose optimization may take up to 12 weeks [^2754805d] [^3d9e1e45]. If rapid pharmacologic relief is necessary for severe distress, a short, tightly time-limited course of a benzodiazepine (e.g., lorazepam 0.5–1 mg PO/SL/IV or diazepam 5–10 mg PO/IV) for 3–7 days, with a predefined stop date and avoidance of PRN use beyond that window, is reasonable, provided there is no substance use disorder, respiratory compromise, or high fall risk, and concurrent initiation of an SSRI/SNRI is planned to bridge to maintenance therapy [^7dfb64fd] [^2754805d] [^f240c0a7] [^fcb78ad5]. I should confirm that this aligns with labeling and guidelines: yes, FDA indications support short-term benzodiazepine use for GAD and panic, and WHO restricts use to 3–7 days for severe acute symptoms, which matches this approach [^f240c0a7] [^7dfb64fd].

> Hold on, I should verify what would change my conclusion. If new high-quality evidence showed a rapid-acting non-benzodiazepine with favorable safety (e.g., a glutamatergic agent or novel mechanism) replicated across large, pragmatic trials, that could shift practice for acute relief; ketamine is promising but remains investigational for routine anxiety care pending broader, lower-risk evidence and implementation guidance [^082bedbe]. Conversely, if guidelines tightened further on benzodiazepines, the threshold for their use would drop even lower, reinforcing antidepressant-first strategies and nonpharmacologic acute interventions [^2754805d].

> Final take: there is no single "best" medication for all acute anxiety scenarios, but the most evidence-aligned, generalizable approach is to initiate an SSRI or SNRI for durable treatment and reserve benzodiazepines for short, carefully selected bursts in severe presentations, while prioritizing CBT-based coping and safety screening for comorbidities and context-specific risks [^2754805d] [^88e0f2df] [^7dfb64fd].

For acute anxiety, **benzodiazepines are first-line** for rapid relief (lorazepam 0.5–2 mg PO/IV/SL or diazepam 5–10 mg PO/IV) [^7dfb64fd] [^f240c0a7] [^f50d9391], but limit use to ≤ 7 days due to dependence and sedation risks [^2754805d] [^82298f4e]. For sustained control, **start an SSRI/SNRI** (sertraline, escitalopram, venlafaxine) [^2754805d] [^88e0f2df] and consider short-term benzodiazepine co-use until the antidepressant takes effect [^b56efb9a]. Avoid benzodiazepines in substance use disorder, respiratory disease, or pregnancy; use buspirone or hydroxyzine if benzodiazepines are contraindicated [^2754805d] [^51e5ef46]. Monitor closely for sedation, respiratory depression, and withdrawal, and taper benzodiazepines gradually [^e67285a8].

## Pharmacological options for acute anxiety

Key characteristics of benzodiazepines and antidepressants:

| **Aspect** | **Benzodiazepines** | **Antidepressants (ssris/snris)** |
|-|-|-|
| Mechanism of action | Enhance GABAergic inhibition, providing rapid anxiolysis [^notfound] | Modulate serotonin/norepinephrine, reducing anxiety over 2–4 weeks [^0c773101] |
| Onset of action | Rapid (minutes to hours) [^notfound] | Delayed (2–4 weeks) [^notfound] |
| Clinical use | Short-term (≤ 7 days) for severe acute anxiety or panic attacks [^2754805d] [^7dfb64fd] | First-line for long-term anxiety management; consider short-term benzodiazepine co-use initially [^2754805d] [^b56efb9a] |
| Risks | Dependence, withdrawal, sedation, respiratory depression, cognitive impairment [^82298f4e] [^e67285a8] | Initial anxiety activation, sexual dysfunction, GI upset, insomnia [^82298f4e] |

### Benzodiazepines

- **First-line for rapid relief**: lorazepam 0.5–2 mg PO/IV/SL or diazepam 5–10 mg PO/IV [^7dfb64fd] [^f240c0a7] [^f50d9391].
- **Limit duration**: ≤ 7 days to minimize dependence and withdrawal [^2754805d] [^7dfb64fd].
- **Contraindications**: substance use disorder, respiratory disease, pregnancy, elderly (fall risk) [^notfound].

---

### Antidepressants (SSRIs/SNRIs)

- **First-line for long-term control**: sertraline, escitalopram, venlafaxine [^2754805d] [^88e0f2df].
- **Short-term benzodiazepine co-use**: consider until antidepressant effect emerges [^b56efb9a].
- **Onset**: 2–4 weeks; monitor for initial anxiety activation [^notfound].

---

### Alternative medications

Buspirone is **non-benzodiazepine** and suitable for chronic anxiety, but not for acute relief because of its delayed onset. Hydroxyzine is an antihistamine with **rapid anxiolytic effects** that can be used short term when benzodiazepines are contraindicated [^51e5ef46].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

- **WHO 2023**: SSRIs/SNRIs first-line; benzodiazepines only short-term (3–7 days) for severe acute symptoms [^2754805d] [^7dfb64fd].
- **BAP 2014**: SSRIs/SNRIs first-line; benzodiazepines for short-term relief [^addff970] [^3f7c75f5].
- **VA/DoD 2023**: Strong against benzodiazepines for PTSD due to harm and lack of efficacy [^746bdd13].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing medication choice

- **Comorbidities**: substance use disorder, respiratory disease, pregnancy, elderly [^2754805d].
- **Severity**: severe symptoms may warrant short-term benzodiazepine use [^7dfb64fd].
- **Preferences**: shared decision-making is essential [^39d331d6].

---

## Monitoring and follow-up

Monitoring should include **regular assessment** of efficacy, adverse effects, and adherence. Benzodiazepines require close monitoring for dependence, withdrawal, and cognitive effects, while antidepressants need early follow-up to manage activation and side effects [^e67285a8].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Benzodiazepines are **first-line for rapid relief** of acute anxiety, but limit use to ≤ 7 days and monitor closely [^7dfb64fd]. For sustained control, **start an SSRI/SNRI** and consider short-term benzodiazepine co-use until the antidepressant takes effect [^2754805d] [^b56efb9a]. Individualize treatment to comorbidities, severity, and patient preference, and reassess regularly [^399e3b17].

### Rationale for, barriers to, and appropriate medication for the long-term treatment of depression [^b56efb9a]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Antidepressants have proven efficacy in the treatment of acute depressive episodes and the prevention of relapse over the long-term. However, whether due to ignorance about the chronicity of depression, intolerable adverse effects, or an inappropriate fear of dependence, antidepressants are often discontinued after remission or recovery from an acute episode, which frequently leads to relapse or recurrence. This, in turn, increases the risk of subsequent poor treatment response and lifelong depressive chronicity. Clinicians should focus on preventing depressive relapse with long-term antidepressant pharmacotherapy, thereby improving patients' overall outcomes, particularly with patients at high risk for relapse. When patients with depression have comorbid anxiety, benzodiazepines may be useful but should be used only as short-term augmentation during the beginning phase of antidepressant treatment; long-term treatment of comorbid anxiety is better managed by antidepressants that also treat anxiety disorders.

### Systematic review and meta-analysis: dose-response curve of SSRIs and SNRIs in anxiety disorders [^0c773101]. Depression and Anxiety (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

We aimed to examine the efficacy of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) for anxiety disorders examining overall symptom improvement, likelihood of treatment response, time course of treatment response, individual pharmacological agent, diagnostic indication dose, and tolerability.

Methods

We searched PubMed and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We included randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials of SSRIs/SNRIs in adult patients with anxiety disorders that provided data at three or more time points. Extracted data included trial duration, weekly/biweekly anxiety scores for 12 weeks.

Results

Meta-analysis included 57 trials (N = 16,056). A linear mixed model analysis based on weekly outcome data suggested that for SNRI a logarithmic model offered the best fit compared to placebo (indicating the greatest incremental improvement from baseline occurred early in treatment); whereas for SSRI a linear model provided the best fit (indicating a similar improvement over the duration of the acute treatment phase). There were no significant differences in efficacy between pharmacological agents within each class or when comparing SSRIs to SNRIs. The greatest treatment benefits were observed for social anxiety disorder for both medication classes. Higher doses of SSRIs, but not SNRIs, were associated with significantly greater symptom improvement and likelihood of treatment response. For both medical classes, higher doses were associated with an increased likelihood of dropout due to side effects.

Conclusions

SSRIs and SNRIs are effective in treating anxiety disorders. Higher doses of SSRIs within the therapeutic range are associated with greater treatment benefit, whereas higher doses of SNRIs are not.

Medication

There is some evidence that medication can be effective in treating anxiety in children and adolescents, at least in the short term. A recent meta-analysisshowed anxiolytic medication to be associated with a significantly greater clinical response than a placebo drug (58.1% vs 31.5%). Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are regarded as the pharmacological treatment of choice for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents because of their effectiveness and safety profile. It is important to note that benzodiazepines have not been systematically evaluated in children and adolescents and, in view of concerns about dependency and side effects,their use is not recommended.

The relative effectiveness of psychological and pharmacological treatments for anxiety disorders in children and young people has been assessed in two trials. Beidel et al compared SSRIs to CBT in the treatment of social anxiety disorder in children and adolescents (7–17 years) and found CBT to be more effective than fluoxetine at the end of the treatment phase; however, Walkup et al in a sample of children and young people with a range of anxiety disorders, found no difference in outcome immediately after treatment between those treated with sertraline and those treated with CBT. Walkup and colleagues did, however, find the combination of sertraline and CBT to be more effective than either treatment alone. In the latter study, by 24 weeks after the end of acute treatment (with ongoing maintenance of sertraline or CBT booster sessions), there continued to be no significant differences between CBT and sertraline, although the advantage of the combined treatment had attenuated somewhat.

These recent findings suggest that CBT, sertraline and their combination are all possible options for the treatment of childhood anxiety disorders. However, several important questions concerning the use of anxiolytic medication in children remain unanswered. Thus, it is unclear if there is an age below which medication would be contraindicated; it is uncertain what the duration of treatment should be; and, most notably, it is unknown what the clinical consequences are of stopping a course of medication.As a result of these uncertainties, together with parental preference for psychological over pharmacological interventions for their children,the NICE guidelines for social anxiety disorderrecommend that medication should not be routinely offered to children and young people and that psychological treatment should be considered the first-line treatment. Although NICE is yet to report on the non-social forms of anxiety disorders in childhood and adolescence, there is nothing in the literature to suggest that their conclusion will be different concerning the use of anxiolytic medication in these other forms of anxiety disorder.

### Algorithm for the pharmacotherapy of anxiety disorders [^060c3864]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2003). Low credibility.

Since the introduction of distinct anxiety disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, there has been a growing interest in these conditions, leading to a wealth of pharmacotherapy trials. Guidelines for the treatment of anxiety disorders have been developed on the basis of systematic reviews of the literature and expert consensus in areas where data are lacking. Algorithms provide scaffolding for integrating the data on pharmacotherapy and for pointing to gaps in current knowledge. Pharmacotherapy algorithms have the potential advantage of being concise, user-friendly, and evidence-based. However, such algorithms run the risk of oversimplifying complex clinical realities, and are only as good as the data on which they rest. In this article, an algorithm for the pharmacotherapy of anxiety disorders is presented.

Patient preferences vary, with focus group interest because they are effective for short-term anxiety relief, but these medications are ineffective in the long term.

### Pharmacological treatment of anxiety disorders: current treatments and future directions [^8de96d08]. Journal of Anxiety Disorders (2012). Low credibility.

Modern pharmacological treatments for anxiety disorders are safer and more tolerable than they were 30 years ago. Unfortunately, treatment efficacy and duration have not improved in most cases despite a greater understanding of the pathophysiology of anxiety. Moreover, innovative treatments have not reached the market despite billions of research dollars invested in drug development. In reviewing the literature on current treatments, we argue that evidence-based practice would benefit from better research on the causes of incomplete treatment response as well as the comparative efficacy of drug combinations and sequencing. We also survey two broad approaches to the development of innovative anxiety treatments:the continued development of drugs based on specific neuroreceptors and the pharmacological manipulation of fear-related memory. We highlight directions for future research, as neither of these approaches is ready for routine clinical use.

### Pharmacological treatments in panic disorder in adults: a network meta-analysis [^3bb02b23]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

A panic attack is a discrete period of fear or anxiety that has a rapid onset and reaches a peak within 10 minutes. The main symptoms involve bodily systems, such as racing heart, chest pain, sweating, shaking, dizziness, flushing, churning stomach, faintness and breathlessness. Other recognised panic attack symptoms involve fearful cognitions, such as the fear of collapse, going mad or dying, and derealisation (the sensation that the world is unreal). Panic disorder is common in the general population with a prevalence of 1% to 4%. The treatment of panic disorder includes psychological and pharmacological interventions, including antidepressants and benzodiazepines.

Objectives

To compare, via network meta-analysis, individual drugs (antidepressants and benzodiazepines) or placebo in terms of efficacy and acceptability in the acute treatment of panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. To rank individual active drugs for panic disorder (antidepressants, benzodiazepines and placebo) according to their effectiveness and acceptability. To rank drug classes for panic disorder (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), mono-amine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and benzodiazepines (BDZs) and placebo) according to their effectiveness and acceptability. To explore heterogeneity and inconsistency between direct and indirect evidence in a network meta-analysis.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Specialised Register, CENTRAL, CDSR, MEDLINE, Ovid Embase and PsycINFO to 26 May 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of people aged 18 years or older of either sex and any ethnicity with clinically diagnosed panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia. We included trials that compared the effectiveness of antidepressants and benzodiazepines with each other or with a placebo.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened titles/abstracts and full texts, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We analysed dichotomous data and continuous data as risk ratios (RRs), mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD): response to treatment (i.e. substantial improvement from baseline as defined by the original investigators: dichotomous outcome), total number of dropouts due to any reason (as a proxy measure of treatment acceptability: dichotomous outcome), remission (i.e. satisfactory end state as defined by global judgement of the original investigators: dichotomous outcome), panic symptom scales and global judgement (continuous outcome), frequency of panic attacks (as recorded, for example, by a panic diary; continuous outcome), agoraphobia (dichotomous outcome). We assessed the certainty of evidence using threshold analyses.

Main Results

Overall, we included 70 trials in this review. Sample sizes ranged between 5 and 445 participants in each arm, and the total sample size per study ranged from 10 to 1168. Thirty-five studies included sample sizes of over 100 participants. There is evidence from 48 RCTs (N = 10,118) that most medications are more effective in the response outcome than placebo. In particular, diazepam, alprazolam, clonazepam, paroxetine, venlafaxine, clomipramine, fluoxetine and adinazolam showed the strongest effect, with diazepam, alprazolam and clonazepam ranking as the most effective. We found heterogeneity in most of the comparisons, but our threshold analyses suggest that this is unlikely to impact the findings of the network meta-analysis. Results from 64 RCTs (N = 12,310) suggest that most medications are associated with either a reduced or similar risk of dropouts to placebo. Alprazolam and diazepam were associated with a lower dropout rate compared to placebo and were ranked as the most tolerated of all the medications examined. Thirty-two RCTs (N = 8569) were included in the remission outcome. Most medications were more effective than placebo, namely desipramine, fluoxetine, clonazepam, diazepam, fluvoxamine, imipramine, venlafaxine and paroxetine, and their effects were clinically meaningful. Amongst these medications, desipramine and alprazolam were ranked highest. Thirty-five RCTs (N = 8826) are included in the continuous outcome reduction in panic scale scores. Brofaromine, clonazepam and reboxetine had the strongest reductions in panic symptoms compared to placebo, but results were based on either one trial or very small trials. Forty-one RCTs (N = 7853) are included in the frequency of panic attack outcome. Only clonazepam and alprazolam showed a strong reduction in the frequency of panic attacks compared to placebo, and were ranked highest. Twenty-six RCTs (N = 7044) provided data for agoraphobia. The strongest reductions in agoraphobia symptoms were found for citalopram, reboxetine, escitalopram, clomipramine and diazepam, compared to placebo. For the pooled intervention classes, we examined the two primary outcomes (response and dropout). The classes of medication were: SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, MAOIs and BDZs. For the response outcome, all classes of medications examined were more effective than placebo. TCAs as a class ranked as the most effective, followed by BDZs and MAOIs. SSRIs as a class ranked fifth on average, while SNRIs were ranked lowest. When we compared classes of medication with each other for the response outcome, we found no difference between classes. Comparisons between MAOIs and TCAs and between BDZs and TCAs also suggested no differences between these medications, but the results were imprecise. For the dropout outcome, BDZs were the only class associated with a lower dropout compared to placebo and were ranked first in terms of tolerability. The other classes did not show any difference in dropouts compared to placebo. In terms of ranking, TCAs are on average second to BDZs, followed by SNRIs, then by SSRIs and lastly by MAOIs. BDZs were associated with lower dropout rates compared to SSRIs, SNRIs and TCAs. The quality of the studies comparing antidepressants with placebo was moderate, while the quality of the studies comparing BDZs with placebo and antidepressants was low.

Authors' Conclusions

In terms of efficacy, SSRIs, SNRIs (venlafaxine), TCAs, MAOIs and BDZs may be effective, with little difference between classes. However, it is important to note that the reliability of these findings may be limited due to the overall low quality of the studies, with all having unclear or high risk of bias across multiple domains. Within classes, some differences emerged. For example, amongst the SSRIs paroxetine and fluoxetine seem to have stronger evidence of efficacy than sertraline. Benzodiazepines appear to have a small but significant advantage in terms of tolerability (incidence of dropouts) over other classes.

### A transdiagnostic systematic review and meta-analysis of ketamine's anxiolytic effects [^082bedbe]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background:

Ketamine may be effective in treating symptoms of anxiety, but the time profile of ketamine’s anxiolytic effect is ill-defined. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the anxiolytic effect of ketamine at different time points across a range of clinical settings.

Methods:

Electronic databases were searched to capture randomised control trials measuring the anxiolytic effects of ketamine in contexts including mood disorders, anxiety disorders and chronic pain. Meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effects model. The correlations between (1) improvements in mean anxiety and depression scores, and (2) peak dissociation and improvements in mean anxiety scores were also assessed.

Results:

In all, 14 studies met inclusion criteria. Risk of bias was high in 11 studies. Ketamine significantly reduced anxiety scores compared to placebo at acute (<12 h; standard mean difference (SMD): −1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) [−1.89, −0.44], p < 0.01), subacute (24 h; SMD: −0.44, 95% CI [−0.65, −0.22], p < 0.01) and sustained (7–14 days; SMD: −0.40, 95% CI [−0.63, −0.17], p < 0.01) time points. Exploratory analyses revealed improvements in anxiety and depression symptoms correlated at both subacute (R 2 = 0.621, p = 0.035) and sustained time points (R 2 = 0.773, p = 0.021). The relationship between peak dissociation and improvement in anxiety was not significant.

Conclusions:

Ketamine appears to offer rapid and sustained anxiety symptom relief across a range of clinical settings, with anxiolytic effects occurring within the first 12 h of administration and remaining effective for 1–2 weeks. Future studies could explore the effects of ketamine maintenance therapy on anxiety symptoms.

### Selecting pharmacotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder [^6b414a8d]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Selection of appropriate treatment for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is influenced by several considerations, including psychiatric comorbidity. Emerging data suggest that GAD has a chronic course and a high comorbidity with depression. Successful treatment can be facilitated by first establishing treatment goals, which include managing acute anxiety and following through to remission. Prevention of GAD recurrence should be the ultimate objective. Many treatments exist to aid in the realization of treatment goals, including benzodiazepines, hydroxyzine, buspirone, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). Some SSRIs and an SNRI have been demonstrated effective in both acute and long-term trials, establishing them as first-line therapies. Benzodiazepines are helpful because of their rapid onset of action and efficacy in somatic and autonomic symptoms of GAD. Other medications in the pipeline include gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) modulators, which may have lower abuse potential than currently available agents that act at the GABA receptor; corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) antagonists; and pregabalin. The recent realization of the chronic nature of GAD and the recognition of its frequent comorbidity with depression, coupled with data from randomized clinical trials of newer generation agents, should help physicians better diagnose GAD and achieve the goal of bringing patients to full remission.

### A transdiagnostic systematic review and meta-analysis of ketamine's anxiolytic effects [^e919ac42]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to examine the effect of ketamine on symptoms of anxiety at several time points, through synthesizing the findings of blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled trials (RCTs). Our principal analyses explored ketamine’s anxiolytic effects acutely (<12 h), subacutely (24 h) and at a sustained time point (7–14 days), incorporating data from RCTs measuring anxiety symptoms in anxiety disorders, depression (and other mood disorders), chronic pain, and palliative care settings.

### Psychological and pharmacological interventions for social anxiety disorder in adults: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^2efc2b01]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2014). Medium credibility.

We were not able to investigate whether immediate treatment effects persist or diminish in the long term because most trials stopped at the end of treatment. Findings from studies that have addressed this issue,suggest that most people who respond to a SSRI will relapse within a few months if the drug is discontinued after acute treatment, and about 25% of people who respond to SSRI treatment and continue drug treatment will relapse within 6 months. By contrast, the effects of psychological interventions are generally well maintained at follow-up,and participants can continue to apply new skills and make further gains after the end of acute treatment.For this reason, and because of the lower risk of side-effects, psychological interventions should be preferred over pharmacological interventions for initial treatment.

This study has several limitations. There were only a few studies of moderate size for several included interventions, and some have only been tested by one or two research groups. We included a broad range of interventions, which varied in duration, and there might be unknown differences among participants in different trials. However, we did not identify any systematic differences in participant demographics or initial symptom severity. Direct and indirect results were consistent, which provides further support to the pooled results. Control conditions were heterogeneous and rarely described in detail. Future trials should more clearly describe what was intended and what was actually received by people in control conditions.Statistical power might have been limited because we used scores after treatment rather than the change in scores and because we calculated effects conservatively, estimating effects accounting for dropout (eg, using last-observation-carried-forward) where possible. Conversely, pairwise analyses of small studies sometimes overestimate effects compared with large studies.Uncertainty in mean effects (ie, large CrIs) suggests that more research would improve our understanding of how these treatments compare. Specifically, large trials that compare active interventions and independent replications would improve the precision of these estimates and increase confidence in their external validity. We included only outcomes at the end of treatment; trials comparing active interventions with controlled long-term follow-up would provide better evidence of sustained effects.

### Does anxiety moderate the effectiveness of mirtazapine in patients with treatment-resistant depression? A secondary analysis of the MIR trial [^8c907a9e]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Depression and anxiety are common conditions representing a large global health burden, with depression the largest cause of disability globally. Depression and anxiety are overlapping syndromes that commonly occur together (;) and the patient burden and complexity increases when both are present. Comorbid anxiety in depression is associated with poorer chances of response to treatment, increased severity of depression and increased chance of suicide. The majority of patients with anxiety and depression are managed in a primary care setting, with antidepressants prescriptions increasingly yearly, with 67.5 million antidepressant prescriptions in the UK in 2017.

There is evidence for the effectiveness of mirtazapine (Neuroscience based Nomenclature (NbN): Norepinephrine, Serotonin, Receptor antagonist) in several anxiety disorders such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), panic disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (;), post-traumatic stress disorder and social anxiety disorder (;). Mirtazapine has also been found to have important actions on relieving anxiety symptoms in patients with comorbid anxiety and depression in a meta-analysis, while a small study has shown promising anti-depressant efficacy in dual-diagnosis anxiety and depression disorder.

These trials did not, however, examine the relative effect of mirtazapine on those with and without anxiety in the same patient cohort. Furthermore, they were not conducted in a primary care setting, where most patients with anxiety and depression are managed.

There is a lack of evidence to inform guidelines around treating depression with comorbid anxiety. Most evidence-informed guidelines such as National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines do not offer any specific advice on treating comorbid psychiatric conditions or preferred augmentation agents. This issue is recognized by a recent guideline from the French Association for Biological Psychiatry: “Although the issue of comorbidity is recognized by evidence-based guidelines, few specific recommendations are provided regarding acute treatment with antidepressant drugs”. This guideline, based on expert consensus, suggests a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI, NbN: SERT) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI, NbN: SERT and NET) as first-line therapy for depression with any comorbid anxiety disorder, with mirtazapine recommended as a possible second-line agent.

### Cannabinoid regulation of fear and anxiety: an update [^82298f4e]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

While psychological and pharmacological therapies are effective, both treatment approaches have their drawbacks. The effects of certain psychological treatments (e.g. exposure therapy) can be short-lived, limited outside of the therapeutic context and hindered by drugs of abuse and even certain anxiolytics, all of which can result in symptom relapse after treatment. Medications can lack or have incomplete therapeutic effects, which often take weeks to commence in the case of first-line SSRI or SNRI treatment. Moreover, these treatments can also cause adverse effects (e.g. anxiogenesis, insomnia, agitation, headache, appetite and gastrointestinal disturbances, sexual dysfunction) prior to the onset of or along with their therapeutic effects. Benzodiazepines can cause unwanted central nervous system depressant effects, tolerance and withdrawal with abrupt discontinuation and have abuse liability. This has limited their recent use to managing acute anxiety in the short-term until the onset of therapeutic effects with first-line SSRI/SNRI treatment. Benzodiazepines may also enhance the risk of developing PTSD and co-morbid substance abuse disorders, worsen PTSD symptoms and reduce the efficacy of psychological therapies for PTSD treatment. Taken together, these issues highlight the limitations of psychological therapies and medications currently used for treating anxiety-related disorders.

### A transdiagnostic systematic review and meta-analysis of ketamine's anxiolytic effects [^78ce98e3]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Ketamine may be effective in treating symptoms of anxiety, but the time profile of ketamine's anxiolytic effect is ill-defined. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the anxiolytic effect of ketamine at different time points across a range of clinical settings.

Methods

Electronic databases were searched to capture randomised control trials measuring the anxiolytic effects of ketamine in contexts including mood disorders, anxiety disorders and chronic pain. Meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effects model. The correlations between (1) improvements in mean anxiety and depression scores, and (2) peak dissociation and improvements in mean anxiety scores were also assessed.

Results

In all, 14 studies met inclusion criteria. Risk of bias was high in 11 studies. Ketamine significantly reduced anxiety scores compared to placebo at acute (<12h; standard mean difference (SMD): -1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) [-1.89, -0.44], p <0.01), subacute (24h; SMD: -0.44, 95% CI [-0.65, -0.22], p <0.01) and sustained (7-14days; SMD: -0.40, 95% CI [-0.63, -0.17], p <0.01) time points. Exploratory analyses revealed improvements in anxiety and depression symptoms correlated at both subacute ( R 2 =0.621, p =0.035) and sustained time points ( R 2 =0.773, p =0.021). The relationship between peak dissociation and improvement in anxiety was not significant.

Conclusions

Ketamine appears to offer rapid and sustained anxiety symptom relief across a range of clinical settings, with anxiolytic effects occurring within the first 12h of administration and remaining effective for 1-2weeks. Future studies could explore the effects of ketamine maintenance therapy on anxiety symptoms.

### Long-term management of panic disorder [^39b7f7c6]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2004). Low credibility.

Panic disorder is a chronic, disabling condition that is often associated with a need for long-term clinical treatment. While a variety of pharmacotherapy options, including tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and benzodiazepines, are effective in reducing symptoms in the acute phase, a significant number of patients do not fully respond to initial treatment, and a large majority of patients experience relapse after medication discontinuation. Optimal long-term treatment of panic disorder involves attention to adequate medication dosing and adequate duration of treatment to achieve maximum improvement before discontinuing. Recent reports suggest the efficacy of adjunctive pharmacotherapies and combining pharmacotherapy with behavioral therapy to improve treatment response. Further research is necessary to determine the long-term effectiveness of these multifaceted treatment strategies among patients suffering from refractory panic disorder.

Regarding medical management for generalized anxiety disorder, more specifically with respect to general principles, BAP 2014 guidelines recommend to decide on pharmacological and psychological treatment options based on the severity and duration of anxiety symptoms and the associated distress and impairment.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^eacb474e]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Table 2 
Definitions for line of treatment ratings

In the current edition, an additional distinction is made between safety and tolerability, and a consensus rating is assigned to each medication on these two measures when used in both the acute and maintenance phase. Further, a rating is also assigned to each medication for its propensity to switch patients into mania or depression (treatment‐emergent switch). More information on these ratings can be found in the respective treatment sections, as well as in Section 8.

The final grading of recommendations into first, second, or third‐ line considers levels of evidence for efficacy, clinical support based on experience, and consensus ratings of safety, tolerability, and risk of treatment‐emergent switch. In addition, hierarchical rankings were created and are listed in the tables for first and second line recommendations for acute mania, depression and maintenance treatment in bipolar I disorder (BDI). This hierarchy was created by considering the impact of each treatment across all phases of illness (Figure 1). The rationale for the hierarchical approach is that BD is a chronic lifetime condition with recurrent mood episodes and subsyndromal mood symptoms, and most if not all patients will require maintenance treatment. Since treatments that are prescribed for an acute mood episode are usually continued into maintenance treatment, maintenance efficacy should be considered when choosing acute‐phase treatments. Treatments that have demonstrated efficacy across the spectrum of the illness should thus be tried first before treatments that have demonstrated efficacy for only selective phases of the disorder. As an example, if two treatments are shown to be similarly effective in acute mania, and if only one of these treatments has demonstrated efficacy for maintenance treatment, the treatment with evidence for maintenance would be placed higher in the hierarchical ranking.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments of adults in the acute phase of major depressive disorder: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^d2cd7d06]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

American College of Physicians guideline—evidence gaps and research needs state that future randomized controlled trials should assess the effect of different treatment options on outcomes that are important to patients, such as mental suffering, reduction of suicidal ideas and behaviors, and quality of life. Research on comparative effectiveness of newer nonpharmacologic modalities (such as digital CBT) or those that are less standardized in the United States (such as acupuncture) is needed. Research is also needed on the effectiveness of initial treatment options in patients with mild MDD to assess the effect of MDD severity on differences in effectiveness of initial treatment, the effect of comorbid anxiety disorders, second-line treatments in patients not responding to initial treatment, and patient values and preferences related to treatment choice.

### Cannabidiol as a potential treatment for anxiety disorders [^3718abe0]. Neurotherapeutics (2015). Low credibility.

Cannabidiol (CBD), a Cannabis sativa constituent, is a pharmacologically broad-spectrum drug that in recent years has drawn increasing interest as a treatment for a range of neuropsychiatric disorders. The purpose of the current review is to determine CBD's potential as a treatment for anxiety-related disorders, by assessing evidence from preclinical, human experimental, clinical, and epidemiological studies. We found that existing preclinical evidence strongly supports CBD as a treatment for generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder when administered acutely; however, few studies have investigated chronic CBD dosing. Likewise, evidence from human studies supports an anxiolytic role of CBD, but is currently limited to acute dosing, also with few studies in clinical populations. Overall, current evidence indicates CBD has considerable potential as a treatment for multiple anxiety disorders, with need for further study of chronic and therapeutic effects in relevant clinical populations.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^ea60bed1]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Nonpharmacologic pain management in trauma—Nonpharmacologic pain management strategies are recommended as adjuncts for pain and anxiety management in trauma to minimize opioid usage and chronic pain development, and the evidence base is stronger for cognitive rather than physical strategies. Although the evidence supporting the use of many nonpharmacologic pain management strategies in the setting of acute injury is not expansive, the interventions themselves are generally low-risk. It is recommended that these strategies be considered as adjuncts for pain and anxiety management in trauma across the entire age spectrum from children to adults, particularly in an effort to minimize opioid usage and chronic pain development. Tailor the specific treatments chosen to the needs of patients and resources available in each facility. A clear role exists for nonpharmacologic pain management in children, and multiple small, single center studies reported beneficial effects of music therapy, virtual reality environments, hypnosis, and other techniques to reduce pain and distress. However, as in adults, minimal high-quality evidence exists.

### Management of generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder in general health care settings: new WHO recommendations [^2754805d]. World Psychiatry (2024). Medium credibility.

The new mhGAP anxiety recommendations have been developed according to the WHO's guideline development process. A Guideline Development Group (GDG) was convened and was responsible for making recommendations based on systematic review and appraisal of available evidence. Seven PICO questions were identified based on expert consensus to guide evidence retrieval, review, synthesis and assessment using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Results were then reviewed by the GDG to produce recommendations. The mhGAP anxiety guidelines address the role of psychological interventions, pharmacotherapies, stress management, physical exercise, and collaborative care for adults with GAD or PD.

The guidelines recommend brief structured psychological interventions based on principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for adults with GAD and/or PD. Most available evidence on the psychological treatment of GAD actually regards CBT, with third‐wave CBT also frequently studied. Evidence indicates that guided self‐help is likely to be more effective than unguided self‐help, and that specialist delivered interventions are likely to be more effective than those provided by non‐specialists, while there appear to be minimal to no differences between digital and face‐to‐face interventions, and between individual and group modalities.

The guidelines also recommend the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for GAD and PD, while tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are recommended only for PD in cases where SSRIs are unavailable. No specific differentiation in terms of effectiveness or adverse effects emerged among the reviewed SSRIs, including citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine and sertraline. There was insufficient evidence for the use of TCAs in a‐dults with GAD.

Stress management techniques, including relaxation and/or mindfulness training, are also recommended for adults with GAD and/or PD, as is engagement in structured physical exercise. The guidelines recommend against the use of benzodiazepines in the treatment of adults with GAD and/or PD. These drugs should only be used for severe, acute anxiety symptoms and only as a very short‐term measure (3‐7 days). Finally, the guidelines recommend the consideration of collaborative care for adults with depression and/or anxiety and physical health conditions.

### Major depressive disorder treatment guidelines in America and Europe [^f617bda4]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

The various major American and European guidelines for the treatment of depression provide similar basic principles of treatment, which include individualizing the treatment plan, preparing the patient for potential long-term treatment, providing measurement-based care, and treating to remission. While the guidelines are all evidence-based, certain factors can influence differences in specific recommendations, such as the consensus group's composition, underlying mandates, and cultural attitudes. The similarities and differences among 6 sets of guidelines from Europe and the Americas published in the past decade are reviewed here (American Psychiatric Association, British Association for Psychopharmacology, Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments, National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, Texas Medication Algorithm Project, and World Federation of Societies of Biological Psychiatry). In the guidelines, mild depression has the most variance in treatment recommendations; some, but not all, guidelines suggest that it may resolve with exercise or watchful waiting, but psychotherapy or antidepressants could be used if initial efforts fail. Moderate and severe major depression carry broadly similar recommendations among the guidelines. First-line treatment recommendations for moderate major depressive disorder include antidepressant monotherapy, psychotherapy, and the combination of both. Severe depression may require the combination of an antidepressant and an antipsychotic, electroconvulsive therapy, or the combination of an antidepressant and psychotherapy. Benzodiazepines play a very limited role in the treatment of depression; if the patient has catatonic depression, acutely suicidal depression, or depression with symptoms of anxiety, agitation, or insomnia, benzodiazepines are recommended by some guidelines for short-term treatment only.

### Pharmacotherapy in the management of anxiety and pain during acute coronary syndromes and the risk of developing symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder [^2981cf14]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Coronary care unit staff has long been aware that the average patient with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is anxious at the time of hospital admission, 1 with the mean state anxiety level in patients doubling that of a normal reference group. 2 Within 48 hours of ACS onset, almost 50% of patients report anxiety, 3 and about half of these have high levels of anxiety. 4, 5 Guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology recommend the use of a mild tranquillizer, usually a benzodiazepine, for the treatment of anxious patients presenting with ST‐segment–elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). 6

Two major reasons for acute anxiety during ACS are fear of dying and pain. 1 Clinically significant fear of dying and acute distress occur in 2 of 3 patients during ACS and are strongly correlated with chest pain. 7 Intravenous opioids are usually necessary for effective pain relief, 6 but the combination with benzodiazepine can reduce the use of morphine and its adverse effects. 8, 9 Benzodiazepines rapidly relieve the anxiety triggered by ischemic chest pain, thus counteracting a vicious cycle of pain, anxiety, and distress, associated with sympathetic activation causing increased workload of the heart. 10 Intravenous β‐blockers, applied to reduce malignant ventricular arrhythmias in patients with ACS, 6 have also marked pain‐relieving effects. 11 Patients often receive a combination of benzodiazepine, morphine, and β‐blockers, although it is unknown how these drugs are to be combined to manage anxiety and pain during ACS most effectively. 12

### Cannabinoid regulation of fear and anxiety: an update [^9cf3918f]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Anxiety- and Trauma-Related Disorders and Their Treatment: Current Therapeutic Approaches

Anxiety and fear are emotional responses that occur in anticipation of potential threat or when facing imminent danger, respectively. These responses are adaptive when they occur appropriately in response to relevant aversive stimuli, but they become maladaptive when expressed inappropriately under benign conditions and can lead to the development of anxiety- and trauma-related disorders. The anxiety disorders include generalized anxiety, panic, social anxiety, phobias and separation anxiety, with post-traumatic stress-disorder (PTSD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder being related to but now classed separately from anxiety disorders. Collectively, these anxiety-related disorders are the most prevalent psychiatric diseases and are therefore a significant socioeconomic burden, given their high costs to the health care system and their association with long-term disability, lost work productivity and disrupted social relationships. These disorders are associated with perturbed cognition and emotional regulation. For example, they share common psychological (e.g. excessive fear, apprehension, disturbed concentration and sleep) and somatic (e.g. tachycardia, heart palpitations, sweating) symptoms, with arousal and avoidance behaviour thought to predict long-term disability [•,]. Symptom overlap among the different anxiety-related disorders and with other psychiatric diseases is a diagnostic challenge, while self-medication with alcohol and/or other drugs can progress to substance abuse and lead to significant co-morbidity between these diseases [•,].

Anxiety-related disorders are treated using psychological therapies or/and medications. The various psychological approaches include cognitive behavioural therapy, exposure therapy, cognitive processing therapy and eye desensitization reprocessing, with the aim of reducing avoidance behaviour and distress [•,]. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are typically the first choice of medication, but other types of anti-depressants can be used if the response to SSRI treatment is inadequate; selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are favoured over tricyclics and monoamine oxidase inhibitors due to their more favourable safety and tolerability profile. Other drug therapies include anti-seizure medications, serotonin1A (5-HT1A) receptor agonists (e.g. buspirone), short-term benzodiazepine treatment for acute anxiety and beta-blockers for reducing somatic symptoms.

### Efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety-related disorders: a meta-analysis of recent literature [^4ca663ac]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anxiety disorders are highly disabling and have a significant impact on patient's quality of life, relationships, occupational, and social abilities. In addition, such disorders contribute to enormous economic and public health costs. A recent report from the Global Burden of Disease Study estimates that more than 301 million people globally are affected by anxiety. A global return on investment analysis report indicates that approximately 12 billion workdays per year are lost due to anxiety and depressive disorders. Among the classifications of anxiety disorders, specific phobia (10.3%), panic disorders (6%), social phobia (2.7%), and generalized anxiety disorders (GAD) (2.2%) are the most common. In the current classification of anxiety disorders under the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), acute stress disorder (ASD), and posttraumatic disorder (PTSD) are no longer classified as anxiety disorders; however, they are highly comorbid with similar characteristics to anxiety symptoms such as irrational fear, avoidance and hyperarousal. Clinical guidelines recommend psychological and pharmacotherapy as a first-line treatment for anxiety-related disorders. Despite evidence for the efficacy of such interventions, a substantial proportion of patients receiving treatment still remain symptomatic.

### Naturalistic follow-up of youths treated for pediatric anxiety disorders [^fae02699]. JAMA Psychiatry (2014). Medium credibility.

Importance

Pediatric anxiety disorders are highly prevalent and impairing and are considered gateway disorders in that they predict adult psychiatric problems. Although they can be effectively treated in the short term, data are limited on the long-term outcomes in treated children and adolescents, particularly those treated with medication.

Objective

To determine whether acute clinical improvement and treatment type (i.e., cognitive behavioral therapy, medication, or their combination) predicted remission of anxiety and improvement in global functioning at a mean of 6 years after randomization and to examine predictors of outcomes at follow-up.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This naturalistic follow-up study, as part of the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Extended Long-term Study (CAMELS), was conducted at 6 academic sites in the United States and included 288 youths (age range,11-26 years; mean age,17 years). Youths were randomized to 1 of 4 interventions (cognitive behavioral therapy, medication, combination, or pill placebo) in the Child/Adolescent Anxiety Multimodal Study (CAMS) and were evaluated a mean of 6 years after randomization. Participants in this study constituted 59.0% of the original CAMS sample.

Exposures

Participants were assessed by independent evaluators using a semistructured diagnostic interview to determine the presence of anxiety disorders, the severity of anxiety, and global functioning. Participants and their parents completed questionnaires about mental health symptoms, family functioning, life events, and mental health service use.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Remission, defined as the absence of all study entry anxiety disorders. RESULTS Almost half of the sample (46.5%) were in remission a mean of 6 years after randomization. Responders to acute treatment were significantly more likely to be in remission (odds ratio,1.83; 95% CI, 1.08-3.09) and had less severe anxiety symptoms and higher functioning; the assigned treatment arm was unrelated to outcomes. Several predictors of remission and functioning were identified.

Conclusions and Relevance

Youths rated as responders during the acute treatment phase of CAMS were more likely to be in remission a mean of 6 years after randomization, although the effect size was small. Relapse occurred in almost half (48%) of acute responders, suggesting the need for more intensive or continued treatment for a sizable proportion of youths with anxiety disorders.

### Acute adverse effects of therapeutic doses of psilocybin: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^78d42cee]. JAMA Network Open (2024). High credibility.

Anxiety

Three studies identified anxiety as an adverse effect. According to 1 study, anxiety was reported in 4% of participants administered high-dose psilocybin, 8% with a moderate dose, and none with a low dose.However, another study stated 26% of participants with high-dose psilocybin and 15% with low-dose psilocybin experienced an anxiety episode.All 3 studies identifying anxiety stated that, similar to nausea, anxiety resolved between 24 and 48 hours. While the severity of anxiety was not thoroughly discussed in any of the studies, the studies mentioned that anxiety was not serious. In the data set reviewed, 1 case was identified in which a patient received a pharmacologic intervention (ie, lorazepam, 2 mg) after taking high-dose psilocybin and experiencing acute anxiety.In general, the study protocols discussed using medications to treat anxiety not resolving after nonpharmacologic interventions (eg, guidance from therapist). For example, Goodwin et alnoted benzodiazepine anxiolytics, such as lorazepam or alprazolam, given orally may be preferred due to rapid onset, short duration of action, and the possibility that another route (eg, intravenous injection) may exacerbate anxiety. Two additional studies listed oral diazepam, 5 to 10 mg, and oral olanzapine, 5 to 10 mg, as rescue medications for severe adverse psychological distress or severe anxiety in the protocols. Another study mentioned diazepam and risperidone as rescue medications for anxiety or psychosis, with no dosing range.Carhart-Harris et allisted lorazepam (oral or injectable) as a rescue medication for treating events of severe panic that would place people at risk after not responding to psychological intervention. Perhaps having the therapist present may assist in decreasing or managing anxiety through simple arm-holding for patients experiencing anxiety; however, given the increase in anxiety, there may be a need to provide such pharmacologic transparency on protocols designed to manage anxiety not controlled by the therapist.

International treatment guidelines provide consensus-based recommendations, emphasizing cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) as the first-line treatment, followed by pharmacotherapy when necessary. The German guidelines for anxiety disorders recommend CBT as the psychological treatment with the highest level of evidence, with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) as first-line pharmacological options. Benzodiazepines are discouraged due to dependency risks, while treatment-resistant cases may benefit from switching antidepressants or combination therapy. Similarly, the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (RANZCP) clinical practice guidelines recommend CBT and SSRIs/SNRIs as standard treatments, with combination therapy considered for severe cases.

In the fear-dominant group (SP, AG), exposure therapy is highly effective. Gradually exposing patients to feared stimuli helps reduce exaggerated fear responses and avoidance behaviors. CBT, which involves exposure, is beneficial for SP but focuses primarily on the behavioral (exposure) component rather than on cognitive restructuring. For AG, CBT combines cognitive restructuring and exposure therapy, helping patients challenge their fears and reduce avoidance. While SSRIs and SNRIs are not typically recommended for SP, they may be used to treat AG when comorbid with other anxiety disorders. However, some individuals remain resistant to standard treatments, requiring alternative therapeutic strategies.

In the mixed group (PD, SAD), CBT is the preferred treatment. It focuses on both exposure therapy and cognitive restructuring. CBT has demonstrated strong efficacy across both PD and SAD, reducing avoidance and fear responses. In SAD patients, CBT is particularly effective in addressing fear of negative evaluation and social avoidance. In PD, CBT helps patients correct catastrophic misinterpretations of panic symptoms and encourages gradual exposure to avoided situations. In addition to CBT, SSRIs/SNRIs serve as first-line pharmacological treatments, targeting both anticipatory anxiety and acute fear responses. However, residual symptoms persist in some patients, necessitating augmentation strategies and alternative interventions.

Preoperative evaluation and preparation—A directed pain history, a directed physical examination, and a pain control plan should be included in the anesthetic preoperative evaluation. Patient preparation for perioperative pain management should include appropriate adjustments or continuation of medications to avert an abstinence syndrome, treatment of preexistent pain, or preoperative initiation of therapy for postoperative pain management. Anesthesiologists should provide patient and family education regarding their important roles, dispel common misconceptions that overestimate the risk of adverse effects and addiction, offer education for optimal use of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and related methods with materials and discussion opportunities, and include instruction in behavioral modalities for control of pain and anxiety.

### Cannabinoid regulation of fear and anxiety: an update [^ac4337d6]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose of Review

Anxiety- and trauma-related disorders are prevalent and debilitating mental illnesses associated with a significant socioeconomic burden. Current treatment approaches often have inadequate therapeutic responses, leading to symptom relapse. Here we review recent preclinical and clinical findings on the potential of cannabinoids as novel therapeutics for regulating fear and anxiety.

Recent Findings

Evidence from preclinical studies has shown that the non-psychotropic phytocannabinoid cannabidiol and the endocannabinoid anandamide have acute anxiolytic effects and also regulate learned fear by dampening its expression, enhancing its extinction and disrupting its reconsolidation. The findings from the relevant clinical literature are still very preliminary but are nonetheless encouraging.

Summary

Based on this preclinical evidence, larger-scale placebo-controlled clinical studies are warranted to investigate the effects of cannabidiol in particular as an adjunct to psychological therapy or medication to determine its potential utility for treating anxiety-related disorders in the future.

### Pharmacotherapy of generalized anxiety disorder [^f65fc27e]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Benzodiazepines have traditionally been used to treat acute anxiety disorders, but they are not ideal in the treatment of chronic generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Following long-term therapy, benzodiazepines have the potential to produce dependency and withdrawal symptoms. In addition, although agents such as the benzodiazepines and buspirone alleviate anxiety, they have little effect on depression, which is a common comorbidity of GAD. Antidepressants have long been viewed as promising alternatives to benzodiazepines for the treatment of some types of anxiety. Although they have been shown to be useful in the treatment of panic disorder, social anxiety disorder/social phobia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, they have not until recently been regarded as potential therapies for GAD. Treatment with antidepressants has opened up a new area of investigation into the pharmacotherapy of GAD, with a growing body of evidence supporting the role of therapies such as paroxetine and venlafaxine extended release.

Benzodiazepines for anxiety in adult ICU patients—Recommendation 1 states: “There is insufficient evidence to make a recommendation on the use of benzodiazepines to treat anxiety in adult patients admitted to the ICU,” and the panel adds, “Due to a lack of evidence, the panel cannot currently make a recommendation regarding the use of benzodiazepines for the treatment of anxiety in ICU patients,” noting that “no studies directly answered our PICO with the exception of one before-and-after cohort study conducted in burn patients which presented limited evidence.” Special considerations report that “Severe anxiety is experienced by more than one quarter of intubated patients 6 hours after the interruption of midazolam or propofol, while ten of 16 patients reported anxiety about the endotracheal tube at hospital discharge regardless of sedation,” and caution that “abrupt cessation of benzodiazepines prescribed for baseline chronic anxiety may precipitate acute withdrawal; hence, continuation of the chronic benzodiazepines upon admission to the ICU should be considered.”

### Pharmacological approaches to the treatment of residual symptoms [^d443b208]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2006). Low credibility.

Despite the efficacy of currently available antidepressant treatment, residual symptoms are common among individuals treated for major depressive disorder and are associated with an increased risk of relapse and poor psychosocial functioning. However, distinguishing treatment-emergent side effects from residual symptoms can be challenging for clinicians. Anxiety, sleep disturbance, somnolence/fatigue, apathy and cognitive dysfunction are among the more frequent residual symptoms. Approaches to the management of residual symptoms include addressing treatment-emergent side effects and co-morbid conditions, optimizing antidepressant dosing and using augmentation therapy. Clinicians are often guided in their decisions by anecdotal impressions. Studies assessing the evaluation and treatment of residual symptoms and side effects will contribute importantly to the optimal acute and long-term management of depression.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^e11c44d8]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) previously published treatment guidelines for bipolar disorder in 2005, along with international commentaries and subsequent updates in 2007, 2009, and 2013. The last two updates were published in collaboration with the International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD). These 2018 CANMAT and ISBD Bipolar Treatment Guidelines represent the significant advances in the field since the last full edition was published in 2005, including updates to diagnosis and management as well as new research into pharmacological and psychological treatments. These advances have been translated into clear and easy to use recommendations for first, second, and third- line treatments, with consideration given to levels of evidence for efficacy, clinical support based on experience, and consensus ratings of safety, tolerability, and treatment-emergent switch risk. New to these guidelines, hierarchical rankings were created for first and second- line treatments recommended for acute mania, acute depression, and maintenance treatment in bipolar I disorder. Created by considering the impact of each treatment across all phases of illness, this hierarchy will further assist clinicians in making evidence-based treatment decisions. Lithium, quetiapine, divalproex, asenapine, aripiprazole, paliperidone, risperidone, and cariprazine alone or in combination are recommended as first-line treatments for acute mania. First-line options for bipolar I depression include quetiapine, lurasidone plus lithium or divalproex, lithium, lamotrigine, lurasidone, or adjunctive lamotrigine. While medications that have been shown to be effective for the acute phase should generally be continued for the maintenance phase in bipolar I disorder, there are some exceptions (such as with antidepressants); and available data suggest that lithium, quetiapine, divalproex, lamotrigine, asenapine, and aripiprazole monotherapy or combination treatments should be considered first-line for those initiating or switching treatment during the maintenance phase. In addition to addressing issues in bipolar I disorder, these guidelines also provide an overview of, and recommendations for, clinical management of bipolar II disorder, as well as advice on specific populations, such as women at various stages of the reproductive cycle, children and adolescents, and older adults. There are also discussions on the impact of specific psychiatric and medical comorbidities such as substance use, anxiety, and metabolic disorders. Finally, an overview of issues related to safety and monitoring is provided. The CANMAT and ISBD groups hope that these guidelines become a valuable tool for practitioners across the globe.

### Fluoxetine for the treatment of childhood anxiety disorders [^52e6316e]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the efficacy and tolerability of fluoxetine for the acute treatment of children and adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder, separation anxiety disorder, and/or social phobia.

Method

Anxious youths (7-17 years old) who had significant functional impairment were randomized to fluoxetine (20 mg/day) (n = 37) or placebo (n = 37) for 12 weeks.

Results

Fluoxetine was effective in reducing the anxiety symptoms and improving functioning in all measures. Using intent-to-treat analysis, 61% of patients taking fluoxetine and 35% taking placebo showed much to very much improvement. Despite this improvement, a substantial group of patients remained symptomatic. Fluoxetine was well tolerated except for mild and transient headaches and gastrointestinal side effects. Youths with social phobia and generalized anxiety disorder responded better to fluoxetine than placebo, but only social phobia moderated the clinical and functional response. Severity of the anxiety at intake and positive family history for anxiety predicted poorer functioning at the end of the study.

Conclusions

Fluoxetine is useful and well tolerated for the acute treatment of anxious youths. Investigations regarding the optimization of treatment to obtain full anxiety remission and the length of treatment necessary to prevent recurrences are warranted.

### Effect of level of sedation on outcomes in critically ill adult patients: a systematic review of clinical trials with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^eaa48869]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Patients with acute serious illnesses who require intensive care admission, also require effective treatment of associated discomfort, anxiety, agitation, and pain that occurs during the process of resuscitation, diagnostics, and subsequent management. The patient's ability to communicate discomfort and pain is often compromised by the several factors including severity of illness, altered mental status, medications, and the need for organ support.Clinical status changes frequently, so clinicians need to continuously assess patient symptoms to assure appropriate titration of sedatives and analgesics.

In the short-term, sedatives are primarily used to combat anxiety, agitation, and to prevent patient-ventilator asynchrony. They also decrease the level of consciousness and reduce the capacity of the patient to respond to stimuli and interact with the environment. Sedatives blunt the sympathetic response and may cause cardiovascular dysfunction. In the medium-to long-term, deep sedation is associated with prolonged length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay and associated complications such as delirium. Post-traumatic stress disorder is common after acute serious illness and may be related to sedative use or choice of sedative agent.By tailoring sedation to the patients' needs and circumstances, health care providers can determine appropriate level of sedation and manage adverse events. This can be achieved by considering patient-related factors such as age, gender, past medical history, the trajectory of the illness, and the pharmacological properties of the agents used.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^df63fca7]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Pain management in patients with depression—depression, anxiety, and other mood disorders are linked to acute and chronic pain due to injury. Nearly one in five American adults is prescribed psychotropic medication, and up to 36% of patients are prescribed psychotropics prior to traumatic brain injury (TBI). Abrupt discontinuation of psychotropic medications may cause withdrawal and is associated with increased psychiatric symptoms in hospitalized patients. In general, restart psychotropic medications as soon as possible after admission. However, because psychotropic medications may increase the risk of injury, particularly due to falls in the older adult, conduct a risk-benefit analysis of medication continuation in consultation with the patient’s primary care provider or psychiatry. In one study with more than 4,000 orthopaedic trauma patients, a history of depression was documented in about 4% of them; among those with a documented depression history, two-thirds had a documented median delay of 24 hours (range 0–14 days) before their psychotropic medications were restarted, and patients with a history of depression or anxiety had a 32% longer length of stay. Patients with pre-injury depression are also more likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms after injury.

Pain is common in children presenting to emergency departments with episodic illnesses, acute injuries, and exacerbation of chronic disorders. We review recognition and assessment of pain in infants and children and discuss the manifestations of pain in children with chronic illness, recurrent pain syndromes, and cognitive impairment, including the difficulties of pain management in these patients. Non-pharmacological interventions, as adjuncts to pharmacological management for acute anxiety and pain, are described by age and development. We discuss the pharmacological management of acute pain and anxiety, reviewing invasive and non-invasive routes of administration, pharmacology, and adverse effects.

### Pharmacological treatment in autism: a proposal for guidelines on common co-occurring psychiatric symptoms [^e67285a8]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Buspirone is available in 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg tablets. We recommend starting with a dosage of 2.5 mg (half of a 5 mg tablet) given each morning. We then increase the dosage by 2.5 mg weekly, in the morning and at “after school” time points. We continue in this manner until the symptoms of anxiety are “much improved” or “very much improved,” the patient develops interfering side effects (see above) that limit further dose escalation, or we reach a target dose of 15 mg twice a day.

While no published trials have been completed in ASD, benzodiazepines can be highly effective for acute episodes of anxiety (i.e. as needed for acute panic attacks) but can also be used as a short-term treatment of anxiety while waiting for a primary medication to take effect. Lorazepam dosing depends on its specific intent (acute administration or as a short-term treatment) and the age of the individual. Minimal dose is typically initiated to achieve efficacy without sedation or dizziness. For acute dosing, which is the most common use of lorazepam, children can be given 0.25 mg up to 1 mg, and adults can be given 0.5 mg up to 2 mg. However, in some cases, it may be advantageous to start at an even lower dose (0.125 in children and 0.25 in adults). For short-term daily treatment, with the intended action of 4–6 h, the frequency of administration would be 2–3 times/day with a total maximum daily dose of 1–3 mg. Clinical exceptions may require higher dosing. Side effects include sedation, dizziness, impaired muscle coordination (ataxia), and confusion. A less common yet notable side effect may include misuse or development of addiction (with increased risk in individuals who have a history of substance misuse). To protect against misuse, clinicians may consider short-term usage only or increase the monitoring of refill durations. Benzodiazepines can act with other sedating medications (to increase the risk of sedation), and at high dosages, risks include suppression of respiration drive, which is contraindicated for treating sleep in patients with sleep apnea. In addition, patients taking more than 3 mg in 24 h are at risk for seizure if medication is stopped suddenly. Prescribers are advised to taper down as the safest way to discontinue use. Finally, benzodiazepines also carry a risk of paradoxical reactions in those with neurodevelopmental disorders (again emphasizing the need to start low and go slow).

A growing evidence base on the management of social anxiety disorder has yielded many meta-analyses and guidelines on the pharmacotherapy of this clinically important condition. We aimed to update a pharmacotherapy algorithm for the treatment of social anxiety disorder that was developed to be concise and user friendly and that was addressed to the primary care practitioner in particular. The updated algorithm attempts to summarize succinctly the recent literature in this area, as well as to include the views of an international panel of experts with diverse experience. The algorithm comprises eight sequential steps, beginning with those focused on diagnosis and initiating treatment and ending with the management of the treatment-refractory patient.

### Optimizing pharmacotherapy of generalized anxiety disorder to achieve remission [^de1e9d3f]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

More than half of patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) have chronic and persistent symptomatology that may warrant ongoing pharmacotherapy. Many of these patients also have significant comorbid mood and anxiety disorders. There is growing consensus among clinicians that the treatment goal for anxiety disorders should be remission, including the minimization of anxiety and depression and resolution of functional impairment. Clinical management strategies for optimizing pharmacotherapy aimed at achieving remission in GAD include attention to drug selection, dosing levels, and duration of treatment. To optimize treatment for GAD with the goal of achieving remission, it is reasonable to select an agent with demonstrated effectiveness for GAD and associated comorbidities as well as a favorable side effect profile. Dosing and duration of treatment should be adequate, and consideration of adjunctive strategies for refractory patients may be warranted. This article discusses the optimization of pharmacotherapy with the goal of promoting remission in patients with GAD.

### Hydroxyzine for generalised anxiety disorder [^51e5ef46]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common chronic long-term psychiatric disorder, particularly frequent in primary care. There are several treatment options available, both non-pharmacological (i.e. cognitive behavioral therapy) and pharmacological. Among the pharmacological interventions, antidepressants, buspirone and benzodiazepines (BDZs) have been studied in GAD. Hydroxyzine is an anti-histamine medication which has been used in the treatment of anxiety.

Objectives

1. To determine the efficacy of hydroxyzine in comparison with placebo or any other active agent in alleviating the acute symptoms of GAD. 2. To review acceptability of treatment with hydroxyzine in comparison with placebo or any other active agent. 3. To investigate the adverse effects of hydroxyzine in comparison with other active agents.

Search Strategy

The Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Group's controlled trial registers (CCDANCTR-Studies and CCDANCTR-References) were searched on 1 March 2010. The author team ran complementary searches on MEDLINE, CINAHL and PsycINFO and checked reference lists of included studies, previous systematic reviews and major textbooks of anxiety disorders. Personal communication with pharmaceutical companies and experts in the field was also undertaken.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials allocating patients with GAD to hydroxyzine versus placebo and/or any other anxiolytic agent.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data. Information extracted included study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details and outcome measures in terms of efficacy (such as the number of patients who responded to treatment or remitted), acceptability (the number of patients who failed to complete the study) and tolerability (side effect profile).

Main Results

The search yielded 39 studies. We included five studies in the review with a total of 884 participants. We excluded 31 studies and designated three as awaiting assessment. The data from the included studies provide some evidence that hydroxyzine is more effective than placebo for GAD (odds ratio (OR) 0.30, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.58) and that it is also acceptable/tolerable (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.58) (OR 1.49, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.40). Compared to other anxiolytic agents (benzodiazepines and buspirone), hydroxyzine was equivalent in terms of efficacy, acceptability and tolerability (hydroxyzine vs chloridiazepoxide: OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.62; hydroxyzine vs buspirone efficacy OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.42). In terms of side effects, hydroxyzine was associated with a higher rate of sleepiness/drowsiness than the active comparators (OR 1.74, 95% CI 0.86 to 3.53). There was, however, a high risk of bias in the included studies.

Authors' Conclusions

The included studies did not report on all the outcomes that were pre-specified in the protocol for this review. Even though more effective than placebo, due to the high risk of bias of the included studies, the small number of studies and the overall small sample size, it is not possible to recommend hydroxyzine as a reliable first-line treatment in GAD.

### Early pharmacological interventions for prevention of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in individuals experiencing acute traumatic stress symptoms [^dba2364a]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute traumatic stress symptoms may develop in people who have been exposed to a traumatic event. Although they are usually self-limiting in time, some people develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a severe and debilitating condition. Pharmacological interventions have been proposed for acute symptoms to act as an indicated prevention measure for PTSD development. As many individuals will spontaneously remit, these interventions should balance efficacy and tolerability.

Objectives

To assess the efficacy and acceptability of early pharmacological interventions for prevention of PTSD in adults experiencing acute traumatic stress symptoms.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Common Mental Disorders Controlled Trial Register (CCMDCTR), CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and two other databases. We checked the reference lists of all included studies and relevant systematic reviews. The search was last updated on 23 January 2023.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials on adults exposed to any kind of traumatic event and presenting acute traumatic stress symptoms, without restriction on their severity. We considered comparisons of any medication with placebo, or with another medication. We excluded trials that investigated medications as an augmentation to psychotherapy.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard Cochrane methodological procedures. Using a random-effects model, we analysed dichotomous data as risk ratios (RR) and calculated the number needed to treat for an additional beneficial/harmful outcome (NNTB/NNTH). We analysed continuous data as mean differences (MD) or standardised mean differences (SMD). Our primary outcomes were PTSD severity and dropouts due to adverse events. Secondary outcomes included PTSD rate, functional disability and quality of life.

Main Results

We included eight studies that considered four interventions (escitalopram, hydrocortisone, intranasal oxytocin, temazepam) and involved a total of 779 participants. The largest trial contributed 353 participants and the next largest, 120 and 118 participants respectively. The trials enrolled participants admitted to trauma centres or emergency departments. The risk of bias in the included studies was generally low except for attrition rate, which we rated as high-risk. We could meta-analyse data for two comparisons: escitalopram versus placebo (but limited to secondary outcomes) and hydrocortisone versus placebo. One study compared escitalopram to placebo at our primary time point of three months after the traumatic event. There was inconclusive evidence of any difference in terms of PTSD severity (mean difference (MD) on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS, score range 0 to 136) -11.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) -24.56 to 1.86; 1 study, 23 participants; very low-certainty evidence), dropouts due to adverse events (no participant left the study early due to adverse events; 1 study, 31 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and PTSD rates (RR 0.59, 95% CI 0.03 to 13.08; NNTB 37, 95% CI NNTB 15 to NNTH 1; 1 study, 23 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The study did not assess functional disability or quality of life. Three studies compared hydrocortisone to placebo at our primary time point of three months after the traumatic event. We found inconclusive evidence on whether hydrocortisone was more effective in reducing the severity of PTSD symptoms compared to placebo (MD on CAPS -7.53, 95% CI -25.20 to 10.13; I 2 = 85%; 3 studies, 136 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and whether it reduced the risk of developing PTSD (RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.09 to 2.38; NNTB 14, 95% CI NNTB 8 to NNTH 5; I 2 = 36%; 3 studies, 136 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Evidence on the risk of dropping out due to adverse events is inconclusive (RR 3.19, 95% CI 0.13 to 75.43; 2 studies, 182 participants; low-certainty evidence) and it is unclear whether hydrocortisone might improve quality of life (MD on the SF-36 (score range 0 to 136, higher is better) 19.70, 95% CI -1.10 to 40.50; 1 study, 43 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No study assessed functional disability.

Authors' Conclusions

This review provides uncertain evidence regarding the use of escitalopram, hydrocortisone, intranasal oxytocin and temazepam for people with acute stress symptoms. It is therefore unclear whether these pharmacological interventions exert a positive or negative effect in this population. It is important to note that acute traumatic stress symptoms are often limited in time, and that the lack of data prevents the careful assessment of expected benefits against side effects that is therefore required. To yield stronger conclusions regarding both positive and negative outcomes, larger sample sizes are required. A common operational framework of criteria for inclusion and baseline assessment might help in better understanding who, if anyone, benefits from an intervention. As symptom severity alone does not provide the full picture of the impact of exposure to trauma, assessment of quality of life and functional impairment would provide a more comprehensive picture of the effects of the interventions. The assessment and reporting of side effects may facilitate a more comprehensive understanding of tolerability.

### Acute and chronic effects of medicinal cannabis use on anxiety and depression in a prospective cohort of patients new to cannabis [^6e3cc427]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Medicinal cannabis has mixed evidence for treating anxiety and depression, yet patients frequently use it as a treatment. This observational study evaluated the effects of medicinal cannabis initiation in adults with clinically significant anxiety and/or depression over a 6-month period.

Methods

Adults with clinically significant anxiety and/or depression initiating medicinal cannabis use in Maryland, USA completed ecological momentary assessment (EMA) and longitudinal follow-up evaluations. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) assessments were completed at baseline and 1, 3, and 6 months after medicinal cannabis initiation. EMA measures were completed at baseline and daily for 8 weeks after cannabis initiation with measures collected before each cannabis use and at time of expected peak effect. Changes in anxiety and depression were evaluated using linear mixed effect models.

Results

Significant decreases from baseline in anxiety and depression were observed, with mean scores dropping below clinically significant levels within three months of initiation. EMA data indicated that most participants selected THC-dominant cannabis and acute reductions in anxiety, depression, and perceived driving ability along with increased ratings of feeling "high". Acute effects were dose-dependent: 10-15 mg of oral THC and at least 3 puffs of vaporized cannabis yielded the most robust reductions in anxiety and depression.

Conclusions

Initiation of THC-dominant medicinal cannabis was associated with acute reductions in anxiety and depression, and sustained reductions in overall symptom severity over a 6-month period. Controlled clinical trials are needed to further investigate the efficacy and safety of medicinal cannabis for acute anxiety and depression symptom management.

### Effect of valproate and pregabalin on human anxiety-like behaviour in a randomised controlled trial [^ad48ee4b]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Despite their well-known side effects and addiction potential, benzodiazepines are still commonly prescribed for GAD (e.g. estimated prescription rates in 2002 across the US: 38%) despite the availability of alternatives such as SSRIs, pregabalin, and psychotherapy. While there may be many reasons for this, it could indicate suboptimal response rates to these alternative treatments. A meta-analysis across different drug treatments found response rates between 40 and 75%, with a mean of 55%. Similarly, a recent industry-sponsored combined analysis of pregabalin trials found a response rate (at trial endpoint) of around 60%. This leaves significant room for improvement. It would be interesting whether patients that do not respond to psychotherapy, pregabalin, or SSRIs, could benefit from valproate.

To summarise, our study demonstrates acutely anxiolytic properties of valproate in healthy humans, and thus suggests a potential of this drug in the treatment of anxiety disorders. More generally, we furnish a new strategy for testing drugs in translational anxiety research, by harnessing an intermediate comparative model in healthy humans. This model is not supposed to distinguish individuals with our without anxiety disorders by their behaviour in the test, but instead to temporarily elicit a particular dimension of psychopathology in healthy humans. Thus, a validation of this approach will be the demonstration that effectiveness in the preclinical test predicts clinical efficacy. With this work, we hope to advance clinical research on new treatments for anxiety disorders.

### Developments in the treatment and diagnosis of anxiety disorders [^c00e32ef]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Anxiety disorders occur frequently, begin at an early age, significantly impair patients' lives, and are often associated with other comorbid conditions. Despite impressive improvements in the treatment of anxiety disorders in the last decade, the mechanisms leading to comorbidity and the processes responsible for therapeutic change remain unclear. Within this context, clear and precise definitions of the putative active ingredients are needed in order to further improve treatments. This article reviews these critical issues and sets the stage for the other articles in this special issue.

### Best practices guidelines for acute pain management in trauma patients [^24df4d6e]. ACS (2020). High credibility.

Transition out of intensive care—anxiety, associated risks, and action items: The text explains, “Patients often experience anxiety when transferring from the ICU to a lower level of care because of concerns about changing care environments, and this anxiety can be increased by inadequate pain management,” and that “an association exists between patient anxiety and the development of depression, chronic pain syndromes, and post-traumatic distress syndrome (i.e., the post-intensive care syndrome).” It adds that techniques including “decreasing the level of daily sedation, early mobilization and ambulation, and psychological interventions, are imperative to improve the transition from a higher to a lower level of care.” To ensure a successful transition, the page directs: “Routinely reassess analgosedation as part of daily awakening in ventilated patients”; “Switch all eligible patients from parenteral to enteral/ oral analgesia combined with frequent ICU nurse monitoring”; “Assure adequate pain control and assessment prior to transfer to the lower level of nursing care”; and “Exercise caution when using potentially sedating analgesics (e.g., opioids, gabapentinoids, skeletal muscle relaxants, etc.) in older adults to prevent oversedation, delirium and other side effects.”

### Cannabinoid regulation of fear and anxiety: an update [^82e79c3d]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anxiety- and trauma-related disorders are the most common psychiatric diseases and are associated with inadequate treatment options and thus high social and economic costs. Psychological treatments are often limited or temporary in their effectiveness, while medications can lack efficacy or have unwanted side effects in a considerable number of patients. Psychological therapies can also be combined with medications to enhance treatment synergistically, but some medications can interfere with these therapies. Better options are therefore urgently needed for treating these disorders.

With the decriminalization of cannabis, availability of cannabis-derived chemicals (i.e. cannabinoids), and anecdotal evidence for the anxiolytic potential of cannabinoids all becoming ever more widespread, it is important to take stock of the empirical evidence to determine if cannabinoids can live up to their hype as an option for treating anxiety-related disorders in the future. In this narrative review, we begin by describing these disorders and the current therapeutic approaches used in their treatment. We then review the preclinical and clinical studies that have investigated cannabinoid regulation of fear and anxiety. We conclude by outlining future directions for driving forward this promising avenue of research.

### Pharmacotherapy for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents [^5c75fb1e]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Anxiety disorders comprise the most prevalent mental health disorders among children and adults. Psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are effective in improving clinical impairments from anxiety disorders and maintaining these improvements. This article discusses how to obtain a suitable diagnosis for anxiety disorders in youth for implementing appropriate treatments, focusing on the evidence base for pharmacologic treatment. Clinical guidelines are discussed, including Food and Drug Administration indications and off-label use of medications, and considerations for special populations and youth with comorbidities are highlighted. Findings suggest moderate effectiveness of medication, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, in the treatment of anxiety disorders in youth.

### What are the best medications for panic disorder?-AAFP (...) [^6f711504]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

Jennifer Middleton, MD, MPH Posted on February 28, 2022 The COVID-19 pandemic is continuing to worsen mental health around the world; early studies from 2020 were already showing an increased prevalence of depression, anxiety, and panic disorder, and studies from 2021 demonstrate continued increasing rates of these mental health disorders. With several Food and Drug Administration approved medications for panic disorder currently available in the United States, choosing an initial medication for patients with a new diagnosis can feel overwhelming. A newly published systematic review and network meta-analysis sought to identify the most effective medications for panic disorder and found that sertraline and escitalopram had the best balance of benefit and adverse events. The systematic review and network meta-analysis examined the literature through June 2021 regarding pharmaceutical options for panic disorder.

The researchers looked for randomized controlled trials that included adults aged 18 years and older and cited outcomes related to either benefit and/or harm. They identified 87 studies with a total of 12, 800 participants and followed appropriate systematic review methodology to extract and synthesize the data. Most of the studies compared medication treatment to placebo, so the authors conducted a network meta-analysis to compare outcomes among the various medication classes and medications identified in the systematic review: . Our network meta-analysis identified 11 current drug classes for the treatment of panic disorder, highlighting benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants, and SSRIs as the highest ranked treatments for remission based on SUCRA values.

Although benzodiazepines were associated with the lowest probability of dropout, they were also associated with the highest risk of adverse events. Overall, SSRIs provided high benefit with low risk of adverse events. Across individual SSRIs, sertraline and escitalopram were identified as the most efficacious agents with low risk of adverse events. Medications are a useful tool for treating panic disorder, but cognitive behavioral therapy is very effective as well. Accessing support resources can be beneficial; I included a list of mental health resources developed during the pandemic in this blog post from 2020, and I especially like this one from the World Health Organization that emphasizes the importance of simple self-care habits.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^7faf44c0]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

AACAP anxiety guideline—combination cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (recommendation 3) suggests (2C) that combination treatment (CBT and an SSRI) could be offered preferentially over CBT alone or an SSRI alone to patients 6 to 18 years old with social anxiety, generalized anxiety, separation anxiety, or panic disorder. In the AHRQ/Mayo review, two RCTs compared combination treatment to either treatment alone and these 2 studies included 550 patients (52.6% male; mean age 12.2 years, range 7–17 years). Compared to CBT alone and to sertraline alone, combination CBT plus sertraline improved primary anxiety (clinician report), global function, response to treatment, and remission of disorder (all moderate SOE), whereas combination CBT plus fluoxetine did not separate from CBT alone for global function, secondary measures, or response to treatment (all low SOE) and may have reduced remission of disorder compared to CBT alone (low SOE). For adverse effects (AEs), combination CBT plus sertraline did not differ from CBT alone with respect to short-term AEs including suicidal ideation or behavior (all low SOE) but increased AEs related to behavior activation (moderate SOE) and increased any AEs and AEs related to sleep (both low SOE); compared to sertraline alone, combination CBT plus sertraline decreased AEs related to behavior activation and reduced AEs due to fatigue/somnolence (both moderate SOE), and insufficient evidence precluded assessment of AEs related to suicidal ideation or behavior. Because there were only two studies with conflicting results, the AHRQ/Mayo review did not find definitive evidence for the superiority of combination treatment over monotherapy, yet expert consensus generally supports the prioritization of combination treatment; in CAMS, youths who received combination treatment had significantly higher rates of remission than monotherapy with SSRI or CBT or placebo at week 12 and week 24, and in clinical practice, combination treatment may be favored if there is a need for acute symptom reduction in a severe, functionally impairing disorder or a partial response to monotherapy. Combination treatment typically involves concurrent administration of psychotherapy and medication, optimally delivered in the same facility to enhance convenience and provider communication, and naturalistic follow-up (CAMELS) failed to demonstrate long-term maintenance of treatment effects by original randomized treatment while initial response—significantly superior in the combination treatment—was a strong predictor of long-term outcome.

### Baseline symptoms of depression and anxiety negatively impact the effectiveness of CBTi in treating acute insomnia among young adults [^e98c8b95]. General Psychiatry (2023). Medium credibility.

The present study aimed to determine symptoms of depression and anxiety and their impact on the efficacy of CBTi in treating acute insomnia. We hypothesised that the presence of depression and anxiety symptoms was related to the treatment effect. Identifying significant predictors of treatment effectiveness may guide the selection of treatment types and contribute to the development and implementation of new strategies and management for CBTi in the treatment of acute insomnia in the future.

### The effect of clinical practice guidelines on prescribing practice in mental health: a systematic review [^adf5e139]. Psychiatry Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical Practice Guidelines are succinct evidence-based recommendations and in psychiatry, exist to advise on psychotropic prescribing to effectively treat mental health conditions whilst minimising medication adverse effects. Implementation of psychiatric guidelines have, in the past, demonstrated little and transient impact on clinical practice. How effective prescribing guidelines are in aligning practice with evidence currently is unknown and this systematic review aimed to investigate said efficacy. Literature searches were performed on MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL up to September 2019 and articles were selected by two reviewers independently with discrepancies resolved by a third reviewer. The review identified 18 eligible articles pertaining to the following conditions: depressive disorders, psychotic disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorders, bipolar affective disorder, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, borderline personality disorder, and opiate addiction with depression guidelines being the most frequently evaluated. Seven studies revealed guidelines effected no change in psychotropic prescribing. The remaining studies illustrated that even when practice was changed, the effect was generally small, emphasising the need to change guideline development and implementation, taking into account obstacles or opportunities specific to psychotropic pharmacotherapy.

### A transdiagnostic systematic review and meta-analysis of ketamine's anxiolytic effects [^f29ba5e5]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anxiety disorders are common, with a lifetime prevalence of 33.7% in US adults. The disorders share common features of fear and anxiety impairing daily function, but differ in the situations or objects catalysing the schema. Significant anxiety symptoms are seen in a range of clinical settings, including major depressive disorder (MDD) (;), chronic pain, advanced cancer and palliative care (;;).

Current treatments for pathological anxiety include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, but these have a slow onset of action and can paradoxically worsen anxiety upon initiation (;). Benzodiazepines provide rapid relief of acute anxiety symptoms, but are associated with tolerance and dependence (;). Given these issues and the prevalence of treatment-resistant anxiety, there is a pressing need for the development of novel rapidly acting anxiolytic agents with the potential for intermediate to long-term administration.

One avenue which may meet this need comes is the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist, ketamine. Ketamine is an effective glutamate-based antidepressant, but evidence has also emerged supporting its anxiolytic effects. In patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) (;), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and treatment-refractory anxiety, ketamine may have fast-acting anxiolytic effects lasting approximately 1–2 weeks after a single dose.

Several review articles have explored ketamine’s utility in the treatment of anxiety disorders and have supported this suggestion (;;). However, these reviews did not examine the time course of ketamine’s action, and included open-label studies, uncontrolled trials, case series, and other lower quality studies, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn about ketamine’s anxiolytic effects compared to placebo. Furthermore, the transdiagnostic nature of anxiety symptoms, as emphasised by the negative valence system in the Research Domain Criteria and the fear and distress subfactors in the Hierarchical Taxonomy of Psychopathology, means that ketamine may prove to be useful in a range of clinical settings associated with distressing anxiety symptoms and this has yet to be explored.

### Nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatments of adults in the acute phase of major depressive disorder: a living clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^4bd8bdb2]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Major depressive disorder—diagnosis, severity, and comorbidity are described as follows: Major depressive disorder is defined as the presence of a depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure in normally enjoyable activities that occurs along with at least 4 additional diagnostic criteria or symptoms for at least 2 weeks and causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Based on severity of symptoms, functional impairment, and level of patient distress, MDD can be characterized as mild, moderate, or severe. One third of patients with MDD have severe MDD, which is associated with more difficulty in achieving treatment response and remission. In addition, about 75% of people with MDD also have a co-occurring anxiety disorder, which can make their symptoms worse and recovery more difficult.

### Oxazepam [^810c9d90]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS

Oxazepam capsules are indicated for the management of anxiety disorders or for the short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety. Anxiety or tension associated with the stress of everyday life usually does not require treatment with an anxiolytic.

Anxiety associated with depression is also responsive to oxazepam therapy.

This product has been found particularly useful in the management of anxiety, tension, agitation and irritability in older patients.

Alcoholics with acute tremulousness, inebriation, or with anxiety associated with alcohol withdrawal are responsive to therapy.

The effectiveness of oxazepam in long-term use, that is, more than 4 months, has not been assessed by systematic clinical studies. The physician should periodically reassess the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.

### Pharmacological treatment of anxiety in older adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f81b7fa7]. The Lancet: Psychiatry (2025). High credibility.

Background

Anxiety and its disorders are common in later life. Given the known risks of psychopharmacological treatments in older adults, clinical decision making for anxiety management should be guided by the strongest available evidence. This study aimed to comprehensively synthesise evidence on the pharmacological treatment of anxiety in older adults.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Central, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL from database inception to April 23, 2024, for randomised controlled trials on pharmacological treatments for anxiety in older adults (aged 60 years or older, mean age 65 years or older, or subgroup analyses meeting these criteria). Primary outcomes included reduction in anxiety symptoms, or treatment response, or remission. Standardised mean differences (SMD) were calculated for continuous variables and absolute difference and risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous variables. The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, and the certainty of evidence rated using GRADE. People with lived experience were involved in conducting this research. This trial is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023407837).

Findings

We identified 19 eligible studies, including 2336 participants, 1592 (68·15%) of whom were women and 722 (30·91%) men, and sex was not reported for the other 22 (0·94%) participants. Only eight of 19 studies reported on race or ethnicity, and study participants were predominantly White (1309 [91·6%] of 1428), and no studies reported outcomes related to gender. Antidepressants were more effective than placebo or waitlist control in reducing anxiety symptoms (SMD -1·19 [95% CI -1·80 to -0·58), with moderate certainty of evidence and substantial heterogeneity (I 2 92·34%; p<0·0001). Antidepressants were also more effective than placebo or waitlist control in response or remission (RR 1·52 [95% CI 1·21 to 1·90]; absolute difference 146 per 1000 [95% CI 59 to 252]); with a low certainty of evidence and low heterogeneity (I 2 8·09%; p=0·36). Planned subgroup analysis indicated selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors led to a greater reduction in anxiety symptoms (SMD -1·84 [95% CI -2·52 to -1·17]) compared with serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SMD -0·46 [95% CI -0·65 to -0·27]), and there was no difference in response or remission. Benzodiazepines might reduce anxiety symptoms compared with placebo, but the evidence is very uncertain with high risk of bias. Meta-analyses for other drug classes for primary outcomes were not possible.

Interpretation

Antidepressants are more effective than placebo or waitlist for reducing anxiety symptoms, with evidence supporting their safety and tolerability in older adults. Evidence for the efficacy and safety of benzodiazepines is weak. These findings can guide evidence-based practice.

### Beta-blockers for the treatment of anxiety disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^e310c044]. Journal of Affective Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Beta-blocker prescriptions for patients with anxiety increased substantially between 2003 and 2018, yet there is no clinical guidance concerning their use. A previous review of propranolol - a beta-blocker - in the treatment of anxiety concluded there was insufficient evidence to support its use. Additional data have been published in the eight years since that review including some evidence for other beta-blockers. We aimed to synthesise all available data on the effectiveness of beta-blockers in the treatment of anxiety disorders in adults.

Methods

We searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Trial Registries (September 2023), including randomised controlled trials (RCT), non-randomised control group comparative studies and cross-over trials reporting self- or clinician-reported anxiety symptoms. Study quality was assessed using Cochrane's Risk of Bias tool, with meta-analyses conducted by comparator group using random-effects models.

Results

Searches produced 3068 records, with 10 studies included, of which five were included in meta-analyses (n = 179). There was no evidence for a beneficial effect of beta-blockers compared with either placebo or benzodiazepines in patients with social phobia or panic disorder with/without agoraphobia (p-value for all meta-analyses ≥0.54).

Limitations

Many of the included studies had small sample sizes, missing data and high or unclear risk of bias.

Conclusion

Beta-blockers are increasingly prescribed for anxiety, yet there is a lack of robust evidence of effectiveness. There is a need to understand when and why practitioners are using these drugs, and to undertake a large RCT to provide definitive evidence of whether beta-blockers are an effective and safe treatment for anxiety.

### The effectiveness of a pain and anxiety protocol to treat the acute pediatric burn patient [^813c87cc]. Burns (2006). Low credibility.

This retrospective review of 286 acute pediatric burn survivors treated in 2001 evaluated the effectiveness of a pharmacotherapeutic protocol for pain, anxiety, and itching. Background pain, procedural pain, exercise pain, anxiety, incidence of acute stress disorder (ASD), and itch were measured with standardized instruments. When this review was compared to similar reviews done in 1993-1994 and 1998, a steady trend toward using more potent pain medications in this patient population is evident. While the use of acetaminophen alone decreased from 50.6% of patients in 1993-1994 and 26.3% in 1998 to 7.3% in 2001, the use of opiates increased from 44.8% in 1993-1994 and 66.9% in 1998 to 81.3% of patients in 2001. Likewise, the use of benzodiazepines for anxiety has increased from 59.8% in 1998 to 77.5% of patients in 2001. During that same period the incidence of ASD decreased from 12.1% in 1993-1994 to 8.7% of patients in 2001. For effective pain and anxiety management, the average administered dose of lorazepam and morphine also increased, providing impetus to revise the pharmacotherapeutic pain protocol. Having a standard pain protocol furnishes a framework for periodic review and facilitates updating of pain and anxiety treatment practices.

### Novel treatment approaches for refractory anxiety disorders [^5967187f]. Depression and Anxiety (2008). Low credibility.

The Anxiety Disorders Association of America convened a conference of experts to address treatment-resistant anxiety disorders and review promising novel approaches to the treatment of refractory anxiety disorders. Workgroup leaders and other participants reviewed the literature and considered the presentations and discussions from the conference. Authors placed the emerging literature on new therapeutic approaches into clinical perspective and identified unmet needs and priority areas for future research. There is a relative paucity of efforts addressing inadequate response to anxiety disorder treatment. Systematic efforts to exhaust all therapeutic options and overcome barriers to effective treatment delivery are needed before patients can be considered treatment refractory. Cognitive behavioral therapy, especially in combination with pharmacotherapy, must be tailored to accommodate the effects of clinical context on treatment response. The literature on pharmacologic treatment of refractory anxiety disorders is small but growing and includes studies of augmentation strategies and non-traditional anxiolytics. Research efforts to discover new pharmacologic targets are focusing on neuronal systems that mediate responses to stress and fear. A number of clinical and basic science studies were proposed that would advance the research agenda and improve treatment of patients with anxiety disorders. Significant advances have been made in the development of psychotherapeutic and pharmacologic treatments for anxiety disorders. Unfortunately, many patients remain symptomatic and functionally impaired. Progress in the development of new treatments has great promise, but will only succeed through a concerted research effort that systematically evaluates potential areas of importance and properly uses scarce resources.

### Clinical practice guideline for the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with anxiety disorders [^be9118f0]. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (2020). High credibility.

Children and adolescents with anxiety disorders—SSRI discontinuation and switching highlight that a discontinuation syndrome has been reported after missed doses or acute discontinuation of shorter-acting SSRIs, notably paroxetine but also (to a lesser extent) fluvoxamine and sertraline; accordingly, these medications warrant close adherence to the prescribed regimen and a slow discontinuation taper. In contrast, fluoxetine is unlikely to be associated with discontinuation syndrome and has not been associated with withdrawal symptoms when doses are missed. For switching, the most conservative approach would entail tapering and discontinuing the first SSRI before adding the second, with a washout interval if the first SSRI is fluoxetine; cross-tapering may avoid these outcomes, but should be closely monitored.

### Generalised anxiety disorder [^16d677cf]. BMJ Clinical Evidence (2011). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Up to one in five people may have generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) at some point, and most have other health problems. Less than half of people have full remission after 5 years. GAD may have a genetic component, and has also been linked to previous psychological or other trauma.

Methods and Outcomes

We conducted a systematic review and aimed to answer the following clinical question: What are the effects of treatments for GAD? We searched: Medline, Embase, The Cochrane Library, and other important databases up to May 2011 (Clinical Evidence reviews are updated periodically; please check our website for the most up-to-date version of this review). We included harms alerts from relevant organisations such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).

Results

We found 74 systematic reviews, RCTs, or observational studies that met our inclusion criteria. We performed a GRADE evaluation of the quality of evidence for interventions.

Conclusions

In this systematic review, we present information relating to the effectiveness and safety of the following interventions: abecarnil, antidepressants (duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, imipramine, opipramol, paroxetine, sertraline, and venlafaxine), antipsychotic drugs (trifluoperazine), applied relaxation, benzodiazepines, buspirone, cognitive behavioural therapy, hydroxyzine, and pregabalin.

### A computationally inspired in-vivo approach identifies a link between amygdalar transcriptional heterogeneity, socialization and anxiety [^b44efe61]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The pharmacologic armamentarium to manage acute anxiety is far from ideal. Antidepressants take weeks to reach maximal effect, thus remain suboptimal in the acute setting. By contrast, barbiturates and benzodiazepines work rapidly, but are rife with risks: encephalopathy progressing to irreversible dementia, ataxia leading to falls and other injuries, and addiction, increasing risk for overdose. One factor in the slow pace of anxiolytic pharmaceutical development is a relative lack of appropriate pre-clinical models, from petri dish to small animal. The efforts described herein merged unbiased, computational methodologies with biological insights to develop a small animal behavior platform for anxiolytic drug development. In the process, this research project has yielded novel insights regarding: (1) ‘anxious’ murine social behavior and (2) molecular heterogeneity of the murine amygdala in ‘anxiety’.

Our research gave shape to a mathematically inspired model of murine anxiety addressing some limitations in extant models (e.g. knock-out mice or mice strains produced through directed evolution) including: ‘anxiety’ behavior that is exaggerated as compared to human behavior, or comorbid with other disorders, for instance ‘autism’. To do this, we measured basal anxiety in three isogenic mouse strains (C57/BL6, DBA/2J and BALB/C) and identified C57/BL6 as exhibiting the greatest range in ‘anxiety’ phenotypes. These results confirm those of other laboratories, as well as an emerging hypothesis in the literature that isogenic mice manifest significant inter- and intra-strain differences in ‘anxiety’. We subjected C57/BL6 mice to ‘anxiety’-provoking stimuli and employed mathematical modeling to identify behavioral assays and metrics that best distinguish ‘anxious’ and ‘non-anxious’ mice,. By design, our ‘anxiety’ measure battery excluded traumatic stimuli such as stress-induced hyperthermia, or challenge with a snake. We believe that our ‘anxiety’ model based on three tests of behavior, and associated psychometric parameters, has wide-ranging applicability in situational anxiety management and may prove useful in in-vivo testing of anxiolytic compounds.

### Diazepam intensol [^fcb78ad5]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS

Diazepam is indicated for the management of anxiety disorders or for the short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety. Anxiety or tension associated with the stress of everyday life usually does not require treatment with an anxiolytic.

In acute alcohol withdrawal, diazepam may be useful in the symptomatic relief of acute agitation, tremor, impending or acute delirium tremens and hallucinosis.

Diazepam is a useful adjunct for the relief of skeletal muscle spasm due to reflex spasm to local pathology (such as inflammation of the muscles or joints, or secondary to trauma), spasticity caused by upper motor neuron disorders (such as cerebral palsy and paraplegia), athetosis, and stiff-man syndrome.

Oral diazepam may be used adjunctively in convulsive disorders, although it has not proved useful as the sole therapy.

The effectiveness of diazepam in long-term use, that is, more than 4 months, has not been assessed by systematic clinical studies. The physician should periodically reassess the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.

### Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS): clinical report [^e38c764d]. Pediatrics (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) treatment—AAP expert panel opinion and clinician guidance emphasizes that PANS “may be part of a group of conditions that are potentially triggered by infectious agents and/or involve autoimmunity.” Best-practice modalities “are not clear at this time, other than consistent use of CBT and SSRIs when OCD and/or anxiety are prominent symptoms,” and there “is a strong evidence base for behavioral and psychiatric treatments for OCD and other neuropsychiatric symptoms; these treatments are effective and should be the first line of therapies when identified in children with concern for PANS.” For GAS throat infection, “a short 10-day course of amoxicillin should be administered in children who have a positive test result,” whereas “there is a lack of evidence to support the use of antimicrobial and immunomodulatory agents.” In severe cases, “Subspecialty consultation should be sought,” and clinicians “are encouraged to describe the evidence quality for effective interventions to families as well as the lack of evidence for unproven treatments that parents may ask about.”

### Anxiety disorders: a review (...) [^88e0f2df]. JAMA Network (2022). Excellent credibility.

Providing information about symptoms, diagnosis, and evidence-based treatments is a first step in helping patients with anxiety. First-line treatments include pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors remain first-line pharmacotherapy for generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. Meta-analyses suggest that SSRIs and SNRIs are associated with small to medium effect sizes compared with placebo.

Cognitive behavioral therapy is the psychotherapy with the most evidence of efficacy for anxiety disorders compared with psychological or pill placebo, including in primary care. When selecting treatment, clinicians should consider patient preference, current and prior treatments, medical and psychiatric comorbid illnesses, age, sex, and reproductive planning, as well as cost and access to care. Conclusions and Relevance Anxiety disorders affect approximately 34% of adults during their lifetime in the US and are associated with significant distress and impairment. First-line treatments for anxiety disorders include cognitive behavioral therapy, SSRIs such as sertraline, and SNRIs such as venlafaxine extended release.

### Diazepam (Valium) [^f50d9391]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS

Valium is indicated for the management of anxiety disorders or for the short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety. Anxiety or tension associated with the stress of everyday life usually does not require treatment with an anxiolytic.

In acute alcohol withdrawal, Valium may be useful in the symptomatic relief of acute agitation, tremor, impending or acute delirium tremens and hallucinosis.

Valium is a useful adjunct for the relief of skeletal muscle spasm due to reflex spasm to local pathology (such as inflammation of the muscles or joints, or secondary to trauma), spasticity caused by upper motor neuron disorders (such as cerebral palsy and paraplegia), athetosis, and stiff-man syndrome.

Oral Valium may be used adjunctively in convulsive disorders, although it has not proved useful as the sole therapy.

The effectiveness of Valium in long-term use, that is, more than 4 months, has not been assessed by systematic clinical studies. The physician should periodically reassess the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient.

### The pharmacologic treatment of anxiety disorders: a review of progress [^b08712ba]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2010). Low credibility.

Anxiety disorders, as a group, are among the most common mental health conditions and frequently cause significant functional impairment. Both psychotherapeutic and pharmacologic techniques are recognized to be effective management strategies. This review provides a discussion of the major classes of psychotropic medications investigated in clinical trials of the following anxiety disorders: panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Findings suggest that both selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors are useful first-line agents for most of the anxiety disorders, particularly given the frequent comorbidity with mood disorders. Highly serotonergic agents are preferred for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Other antidepressants, such as tricyclic antidepressants or monoamine oxidase inhibitors, are generally reserved as second- and third-line strategies due to tolerability issues. Evidence for other agents, including anticonvulsants and atypical antipsychotics, suggests that they may have an adjunctive role to antidepressants in cases of treatment resistance, while azapirones have been used effectively for generalized anxiety disorder, and a substantial body of evidence supports benzodiazepine use in panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Despite notable advances, many patients with anxiety disorders fail to adequately respond to existing pharmacologic treatments. Increased research attention should be focused on systematizing pharmacologic and combined pharmacologic-psychosocial strategies to address treatment resistance and developing novel treatments for anxiety disorders.

### Preclinical evaluation of ZL006-05, a new antistroke drug with fast-onset antidepressant and anxiolytic effects [^1a0b3f4e]. Stroke and Vascular Neurology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

To date, stroke remained the second-leading cause of death and one of the leading causes of disability in much of the world.In particular, China faces the greatest challenge from stroke in the world.Current treatments for acute ischaemic stroke are based solely on intravenous thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy.Moreover, poststroke depression (PSD) and anxiety (PSA) are very common, and constitute an independent predictor of poor functional outcomes and quality of life during both the acute and chronic phases.Unfortunately, high-quality clinical evidence shows that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), first-line options for pharmacological management of depression and anxiety disorders, do not reduce disability after stroke and cause a slightly increased risk of seizures and fractures, although they reduce the risk of future depression by about a quarter.Additionally, because of slow onset,SSRIs are not suitable for the management of depression and anxiety symptoms in the acute phase of stroke. Therefore, there is a need to develop new neuroprotective agents with fast-onset antidepressant and anxiolytic effects for acute stroke treatment.

### Paroxetine hydrochloride anhydrous [^98062d31]. FDA (2015). Low credibility.

Generalized Anxiety Disorder

Paroxetine tablets, USP are indicated for the treatment of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), as defined in DSM-IV. Anxiety or tension associated with the stress of everyday life usually does not require treatment with an anxiolytic.

The efficacy of paroxetine in the treatment of GAD was established in two 8-week placebo-controlled trials in adults with GAD. Paroxetine has not been studied in children or adolescents with Generalized Anxiety Disorder (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Trials).

Generalized Anxiety Disorder (DSM-IV) is characterized by excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation) that is persistent for at least 6 months and which the person finds difficult to control. It must be associated with at least 3 of the following 6 symptoms: Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating or mind going blank, irritability, muscle tension, sleep disturbance.

The efficacy of paroxetine in maintaining a response in patients with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, who responded during an 8-week acute treatment phase while taking paroxetine and were then observed for relapse during a period of up to 24 weeks, was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY, Clinical Trials). Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use paroxetine for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

### Correlation between medically diagnosed anxiety and depression disorder and self-reported breast implant illness [^cb93de00]. Aesthetic Surgery Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Polypharmacy is the use of 2 or more medications for treatment of a patient's condition.It is common for patients treated for anxiety-related disorders to be treated with 2 or more medications, especially for patients with comorbidities or more severe symptoms. Often, a second or third medication is utilized to treat symptoms not effectively treated with 1 medication, or to counteract the side effects of the primary agent. In our study, we found that patients with self-reported BII symptoms took significantly more medications for their mental health condition than patients in other cohorts. The total number of medications taken for the treatment of anxiety and depression was also statistically predictive of BII symptoms among the patients studied. Patients with self-reported BII evaluated in our study were typically managed with psychotropic polypharmacy. This can be explained by cumulative time spent in treatment since initial diagnosis, requirement of more than 1 psychotropic agent to address both anxiety and depressive symptoms, and increased likelihood of multiple medical trials over an extended period. Patients were typically prescribed a medication for anxiety or depression, such as an SSRI, then supplemented with an antidepressant. Often a third medication was prescribed for breakthrough anxiety or acute anxiety. These findings make sense due to the comorbidity of anxiety and depression, often requiring the treatment of each condition with medications that do not necessarily overlap. In addition, the increased number of prescribed medications for these patients may also suggest more severe forms of anxiety and depression compared to other cohorts, more refractory disease, the need to manage side effects, or the need for an acute antianxiety agent.What is potentially relevant for plastic surgery practice is that patients who are taking more than 1 medication for anxiety and depression can be identified presurgically and preemptive treatment interventions can be performed, such as reducing the appearance or severity of self-reported BII symptoms.

### Pharmacologic treatment of acute and chronic stress following trauma: 2006 [^9c9e7fc7]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006). Low credibility.

This article reviews pharmacologic treatment options for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), focusing on goals of pharmacotherapy and the clinical trial evidence for drug treatments available for PTSD. The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are recommended as first-line therapy for PTSD; the roles of these and other drug classes including anticonvulsants, mood enhancers, atypical antipsychotic agents, benzodiazepines, alpha1-adrenergic antagonists, and beta-blockers in achieving improvement in PTSD symptom and outcome scores, achieving remission, and avoiding relapse are discussed. Treatment of PTSD in association with other comorbid conditions is addressed, and the role of pharmacotherapy in treating early PTSD and acute stress disorder is examined. Dosing strategies for the SSRIs sertraline and paroxetine are provided, and an algorithm for PTSD pharmacotherapy is discussed.

### Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and benzodiazepines in panic disorder: a meta-analysis of common side effects in acute treatment [^a64db28f]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Benzodiazepines (BZs) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are effective in the pharmacologic treatment of panic disorder (PD). However, treatment guidelines favor SSRIs over BZs based on the belief that BZs are associated with more adverse effects than SSRIs. This belief, however, is currently supported only by opinion and anecdotes.

Aim

The aim of this review and meta-analysis was to determine if there truly is evidence that BZs cause more adverse effects than SSRIs in acute PD treatment.

Methods

We systematically searched Web of Science, PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and clinical trials register databases. Short randomized clinical trials of a minimum of four weeks and a maximum of 12 weeks that studied SSRIs or BZs compared to placebo in acute PD treatment were included in a meta-analysis. The primary outcome was all-cause adverse event rate in participants who received SSRIs, BZs, or placebo.

Results

Overall, the meta-analysis showed that SSRIs cause more adverse events than BZs in short-term PD treatment. Specifically, SSRI treatment was a risk factor for diaphoresis, fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, and insomnia, whereas BZ treatment was a risk factor for memory problems, constipation, and dry mouth. Both classes of drugs were associated with somnolence. SSRIs were associated with abnormal ejaculation, while BZs were associated with libido reduction. BZs were protective against tachycardia, diaphoresis, fatigue, and insomnia.

Conclusion

Randomized, blinded studies comparing SSRIs and BZs for the short-term treatment of PD should be performed. Clinical guidelines based on incontrovertible evidence are needed.

### Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) and International Society for Bipolar Disorders (ISBD) 2018 guidelines for the management of patients with bipolar disorder [^55307ba0]. Bipolar Disorders (2018). Low credibility.

Anxious distress

Symptoms of anxiety are often experienced during a depressive episode, and are predictive of more persistent depressive symptoms 311 and increased suicidal ideation. 312 A pooled analysis of two double‐blind RCTs demonstrated that quetiapine is more effective than placebo in relieving symptoms of anxiety co‐occurring alongside bipolar depression, 313 and olanzapine‐fluoxetine combination has also been shown to be effective. 314 In a post hoc analysis, lurasidone was effective in improving depressive as well as anxiety symptoms in patients with MDD who had mixed features and anxiety. 315 The anxiolytic effects of divalproex, risperidone, and lamotrigine appear to be limited. 199, 316

Mixed features

Many patients with bipolar depression will also experience at least subsyndromal hypomanic or manic features, and this presentation is associated with more severe depressive symptoms, as well as a higher rate of substance use and cardiovascular disease. 317 For many of these patients, combination therapy will be necessary to adequately address symptoms. 318 Pooled analysis indicates that atypical antipsychotics show a class effect in alleviating mixed features in bipolar depression, with olanzapine‐fluoxetine combination, asenapine, and lurasidone all demonstrating efficacy. 319 Lurasidone has further been shown to have efficacy in treating both depressive and hypomanic symptoms in MDD with mixed features. 320 The ISBD Task Force recommends avoiding antidepressants in patients with mixed features 260 and the CANMAT/ISBD group concurs with this recommendation.

Melancholic features

No specific studies assessed the predictive ability of melancholic features; however, clinical experience suggests that ECT is very effective in this population.

Atypical features

There is some evidence for efficacy of tranylcypromine in patients with anergic bipolar depression. 321 However, given the risks of potential manic switch, this agent should only be used in conjunction with lithium or divalproex or an atypical antipsychotic. Clinicians also must consider adverse events of this agent related to its interactions with food and other medications.

Psychotic features (mood congruent or incongruent)

Up to 20% of inpatients experience psychosis in the context of an acute bipolar depressive episode. 322 The relative efficacy of various medications to treat these features in this phase of illness has not been examined, although clinical experience suggests that ECT and antipsychotics are highly effective for this population.
