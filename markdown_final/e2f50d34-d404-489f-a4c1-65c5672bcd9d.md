## Question

Is normal for a large amount of fluid left in a body after back surgery

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether it is normal for a large amount of fluid to remain in the body after back surgery, and how to interpret and manage this situation. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "fluid" means in this context and the major differential diagnoses after spine surgery. Then, I should verify what volumes are considered "normal" versus "large" and how to quantify them. Next, I will examine the pathophysiology that explains why fluid accumulates and whether this is expected or pathologic. After that, I need to check which clinical features distinguish benign collections from dangerous ones. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, reference-based management approach and give a clear bottom-line answer with caveats and follow-up recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the terminology so I don't conflate different entities. "Fluid" after back surgery can mean seroma, hematoma, pseudomeningocele (CSF leak), lymphocele, abscess, or simply postoperative edema; each has different implications and management, so I need to ensure I'm precise about which collection we're discussing before calling it "normal" or "abnormal" [^111kmJcy] [^113gopNa].

> Wait, let me verify what constitutes a "large" amount. Quantitatively, drain outputs exceeding roughly 50–100 mL per day are often considered high and may delay removal, and a postoperative weight gain exceeding about 2.5 kg in the first 24–48 hours signals clinically meaningful fluid retention. Similarly, a positive fluid balance beyond roughly 1,000 mL at the end of surgery is associated with more complications, so I should anchor "large" to these thresholds rather than vague descriptors [^111ZA5kN] [^112H8SkR].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — some fluid is expected. Small seromas and modest hematomas are common after spine surgery and often resolve spontaneously. For example, pediatric spinal deformity series show seromas in about 3% that typically resolve with observation, and imaging studies suggest that even sizable epidural hematomas can be seen without new neurologic deficits, though the threshold for intervention is low if symptomatic. Likewise, liberal perioperative fluid strategies predict weight gains up to about 10 kg, reflecting interstitial accumulation that is physiologic but potentially harmful if excessive [^114sCAyi] [^1142eNvS] [^117S2mAt].

> I will now examine the pathophysiology to ensure I'm attributing fluid correctly. Surgical trauma increases capillary permeability and creates dead space, promoting seroma. Blood loss plus crystalloid replacement drives interstitial sequestration because crystalloids distribute predominantly to the interstitium rather than remaining intravascular. General anesthesia further accelerates interstitial fluid distribution into slow-exchange compartments that can persist for days. And specific spine complications like incidental durotomy can produce pseudomeningoceles, while anterior approaches risk lymphatic injury and lymphoceles, all of which can present as "fluid" collections [^113uiNQY] [^111ZLahk] [^115ZEwhi] [^113W4JbU] [^116qj42x].

> But wait, what if the "fluid" is actually a complication masquerading as normal postoperative change? I need to check for red flags: rapid enlargement, severe pain, neurologic deficits, fever, or wound breakdown suggest hematoma, CSF leak, or infection; imaging is decisive — MRI best characterizes seroma versus hematoma and detects pseudomeningoceles, while CT can help with urinomas or lymphoceles and is less affected by metal artifact; if the nature remains uncertain, image-guided aspiration provides diagnostic clarity and can be therapeutic [^111kmJcy] [^113gopNa] [^116ZQ7jq].

> Let me think about how to manage this pragmatically. For small, asymptomatic collections, observation with compression and activity modification is reasonable. For symptomatic or larger seromas, ultrasound-guided aspiration and compression can be effective. For suspected infection, prompt imaging and drainage with antibiotics are indicated. For epidural hematoma with neurologic compromise, emergent surgical evacuation is standard. For pseudomeningocele, conservative measures including bed rest, caffeine, and an epidural blood patch are first-line, with surgical repair reserved for persistent leaks. And for lymphocele, sclerotherapy or surgical drainage may be needed if conservative measures fail [^113gopNa] [^111kmJcy] [^116ZQ7jq] [^116bm7mh] [^114sCAyi] [^116qj42x].

> Hmm, wait a minute — do drains prevent these collections or just move the fluid outside the body? I should double-check that. Routine closed-suction drainage does not reliably prevent hematoma or neurologic complications after thoracolumbar spine surgery and may increase infection risk with prolonged use; in single-level decompression, drains have not reduced hematoma or infection rates, so I should avoid assuming drains equate to better outcomes and instead individualize their use [^113Ae87h] [^116fsUNE].

> Next, I should review how to prevent excessive fluid accumulation in the first place. Individualized, goal-directed fluid therapy that avoids both hypovolemia and fluid overload reduces postoperative complications in major spine surgery. Using balanced crystalloids, limiting maintenance fluids once oral intake is feasible, and incorporating hemodynamic monitoring to deliver fluids only when there is a measurable response are sensible strategies aligned with contemporary guidance [^115EAoE6] [^116U4cMN] [^113E4Dpa].

> Let me reconsider the original question and synthesize. A small to moderate amount of fluid after back surgery is expected and often benign, but a "large" amount — quantified by high drain output, substantial weight gain, or sizable imaging collections — should prompt evaluation for complications such as hematoma, CSF leak, lymphocele, or infection. The key is to correlate symptoms, exam, and imaging rather than relying on volume alone, and to escalate care promptly if neurologic deficits, infection, or progressive swelling emerge [^111kmJcy] [^113gopNa] [^112H8SkR].

> Bottom line, I should confirm the following: small seromas and modest hematomas are common and frequently self-limited, but "large" fluid collections are not "normal" and warrant diagnostic clarification with imaging and, if needed, aspiration. Individualized fluid management and vigilant surveillance for red flags help mitigate both the occurrence and the consequences of postoperative fluid accumulation after spine surgery [^111kmJcy] [^115EAoE6] [^113E4Dpa].

It is **not normal** for a large amount of fluid to remain in the body after back surgery. While small, transient collections are common and usually resolve spontaneously, **persistent or large fluid collections** (seroma, hematoma, pseudomeningocele, or infection) are abnormal and may cause pain, delayed healing, or neurologic compromise [^111kmJcy] [^113gopNa]. Management depends on the cause and size: small seromas may be observed, whereas larger or symptomatic collections often require aspiration, drainage, or surgical intervention [^111kmJcy]. Persistent or increasing fluid warrants **clinical evaluation and imaging** to guide treatment and prevent complications [^111kmJcy].

---

## Types of fluid collections after back surgery

Several types of fluid collections can occur after back surgery, each with distinct characteristics and clinical implications:

| **Type of fluid collection** | **Description** | **Clinical significance** |
|-|-|-|
| Seroma | Clear, serous fluid from disrupted lymphatics or tissue planes | Common, usually benign; large or persistent collections may delay healing or become infected [^114sCAyi] [^113gopNa] |
| Hematoma | Collection of blood from surgical bleeding | Risk of compression, pain, infection, and neurologic compromise if large [^113gopNa] [^1142eNvS] |
| Pseudomeningocele | CSF leak from dural tear forming a CSF-filled cavity | Risk of headache, neurologic deficits, and infection; may require surgical repair [^113W4JbU] [^116mpgEe] |
| Infection (abscess) | Purulent fluid from bacterial infection | Serious complication requiring urgent treatment [^notfound] |

---

## Normal versus abnormal fluid accumulation

Small, transient fluid collections are common after back surgery and typically resolve spontaneously. However, **large or persistent fluid collections** are abnormal and may indicate complications such as infection, ongoing bleeding, or CSF leak [^111kmJcy] [^113gopNa].

---

## Clinical significance of persistent fluid accumulation

Persistent or large fluid collections can lead to **significant clinical consequences**, including:

- **Delayed wound healing**: Persistent fluid can prevent tissue apposition, impairing healing and increasing infection risk [^113gopNa] [^1167J6Pn].
- **Infection**: Fluid collections can become infected, leading to abscess formation and systemic infection [^116bm7mh].
- **Neurologic compromise**: Hematomas or pseudomeningoceles can compress neural structures, causing pain, weakness, or paralysis [^113gopNa] [^1142eNvS].
- **Pain and discomfort**: Large collections can cause significant pain and reduce mobility [^116qj42x].

---

## Management strategies for persistent fluid accumulation

Management depends on the **type, size, and clinical impact** of the fluid collection:

- **Observation**: Small, asymptomatic seromas may resolve spontaneously with close monitoring [^114sCAyi].
- **Aspiration**: Ultrasound-guided aspiration can relieve symptomatic seromas or hematomas [^116ZQ7jq].
- **Drainage**: Persistent collections may require surgical drainage or placement of a drain [^116ZQ7jq].
- **Surgical intervention**: Large hematomas, pseudomeningoceles, or infected collections may require surgical exploration and repair [^113W4JbU] [^113gopNa].

---

## Preventive measures

Surgeons employ several strategies to **minimize fluid accumulation**:

- **Meticulous hemostasis**: Careful control of bleeding during surgery [^111Dg91z].
- **Closed-suction drains**: Commonly used to prevent hematoma formation, though evidence for their effectiveness is mixed [^113Ae87h] [^116fsUNE].
- **Minimally invasive techniques**: Reduced tissue disruption may lower fluid accumulation risk [^notfound].
- **Postoperative care**: Early mobilization and compression garments may help reduce fluid buildup [^112ngot6].

---

## Conclusion

It is **not normal** for a large amount of fluid to remain in the body after back surgery. While small, transient collections are common, persistent or large fluid collections are abnormal and may lead to significant complications. Appropriate management, including observation, aspiration, drainage, or surgical intervention, is essential to prevent complications and promote healing [^111kmJcy].

### Chylous fistula: management of a rare complication following right anterior cervical spine approach [^116NdiQJ]. European Spine Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Chylorrhea resulting from injury of the lymphatic system during neck dissection is a well-known complication. It is an uncommon occurrence in spinal surgery, and only one case after right anterior cervical spine surgery has been described so far. Despite its rarity, chylous leakage deserves a particular attention since it may become a serious and occasionally fatal complication if not detected early and managed appropriately.

Methods

We report the case of a 42-year-old man who underwent a standard anterior cervical discectomy and fusion according to Cloward approach for a C6-C7 disk herniation. The patient developed a delayed prevertebral chyle collection on postoperative day 5, presenting with mild breathing and swallowing difficulties.

Results

He was managed with conservative care, including bed rest, low-fat diet and drainage pouch positioning, which led to the complete resolution of the fluid collection.

Conclusions

Knowledge of the normal anatomy of the lymphatic system and of its variations is essential when planning an anterior spinal procedure, and represents the first measure to be adopted in order to avoid such complication. The prompt identification of a postoperative chylous fistula and the applicability of an individually based management's protocol may help in the majority of the cases to reduce the potential morbidity, without significant long-term effects.

### Seromas following pediatric spinal deformity surgery: is operative management necessary? [^114sCAyi]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Seromas are known complications after pediatric spinal deformity surgery. Although many surgeons perform an early debridement to prevent deep surgical site infections (SSIs), a less invasive approach to seroma management has not been studied. We hypothesized that a conservative approach to seroma management would be safe and yield equivalent outcomes.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of patients who developed a postoperative seroma with or without nonpurulent drainage. Inclusion criteria were patients below 21 years who underwent primary posterior spinal fusion from 1996 to 2016 and developed a postoperative wound seroma. Seromas were clinically defined as an afebrile patient with a fluid collection that was soft and nontender to palpation and without induration or erythema. Growing spine surgeries and revision procedures were excluded from this study.

Results

Twenty-five of 790 total patients with a mean follow-up of 57.8 months (± 48.5mo) developed a seroma. Seromas were identified at a mean of 13.6 days postoperatively and resolved after a mean of 12.2 days following the presentation. Seromas occurred in 12 patients with idiopathic scoliosis, 12 with neuromuscular scoliosis, and 1 patient with Scheuermann kyphosis. All cases were managed conservatively with monitoring of the incision without an operative procedure. In cases of spontaneous drainage, a sterile dressing was applied to the wound and changed as needed until drainage ceased. Two patients underwent bedside needle aspiration and 5 patients received prophylactic antibiotics at the treating surgeon's discretion. All cases resolved spontaneously without development of an acute SSI. Three cases subsequently developed a late SSI (range, 18 to 38mo postoperatively). Two had idiopathic scoliosis and 1 had neuromuscular scoliosis. None of these seromas drained spontaneously.

Conclusions

Conservative management of postoperative seromas after pediatric spinal deformity surgery is appropriate. It is unclear if seromas contributed to the development of the 3 late infections. Further studies are needed regarding the relationship of late infections in seroma patients.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® radiologic management of infected fluid collections [^116bm7mh]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Infected fluid collections are common and occur in a variety of clinical scenarios throughout the body. Minimally invasive image-guided management strategies for infected fluid collections are often preferred over more invasive options, given their low rate of complications and high rates of success. However, specific clinical scenarios, anatomic considerations, and prior or ongoing treatments must be considered when determining the optimal management strategy. As such, several common scenarios relating to infected fluid collections were developed using evidence-based guidelines for management. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

E. Wound drains — drain use and infection risk after single level procedures is addressed as follows: The use of drains is not recommended as a means to reduce infection rates following single level surgical procedures (Grade of Recommendation: I [Insufficient Evidence]). In a randomized controlled trial of drain use in 205 patients undergoing a single level laminectomy without fusion, the patients were randomized to determine whether they would receive a wound drain and there was no difference between the groups in terms of infection rates, and it was downgraded to Level II because it was substantially underpowered.

### Sodium chloride, soldium lactate, potassium chloride and calcium chloride (lactated Ringer's) [^1178wVdY]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

WARNINGS

Absorption of large volume of irrigation fluids through a perforation or open wound may result in circulatory overload, cardiac failure, or electrolyte disturbances and acid-base imbalance.

Patients and fluid balance should be monitored accordingly. If absorption of clinically relevant amounts of fluid is suspected, the fluid administration should be interrupted, and the patient evaluated for possible adverse consequences.

Particularly close monitoring is required in patients with:

Severely impaired renal function
Impaired cardiac function, or
Clinical states in which there is edema with sodium retention as a fluid overload syndrome may develop in these patients following absorption of even small quantities of irrigation fluid.

Appropriate therapy should be initiated, as indicated.

Lactated Ringer's Irrigation must not be used when types of electrocautery are used that are not safe and effective when performed in the presence of electrolyte solutions.

Excessive volume or pressure during irrigation may cause excessive fluid absorption, undue distention of cavities, and/or disruption of tissue.

### Seroma development following body contouring surgery for massive weight loss: patient risk factors and treatment strategies [^11772kyy]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The most common complications following body contouring surgery for massive weight loss include delayed wound healing and seroma. The authors investigated risk factors for seroma in this patient population and describe treatment strategies.

Methods

A retrospective review of 222 patients who underwent body contouring surgery for massive weight loss from March of 1997 to December of 2005 was performed. Risk factors assessed included age, sex, medical conditions, tobacco use, body mass index, weight of skin excised, and surgery performed.

Results

Within this group, there were 187 women and 35 men, with a mean age of 42 years. Weight loss was achieved by open (n = 167) or laparoscopic (n = 35) gastric bypass surgery, or diet (n = 20). Average body mass index at contouring was 33, ranging from 20 to 69. Surgical areas addressed alone or in combination included the abdomen (n = 205), thigh (n = 71), arm (n = 69), back (n = 59), and chest (n = 57). Average weight of skin excised at surgery was 9.6 lb, ranging up to 49 lb. Seroma occurred in 31 patients, placing the risk at 14 percent in this series. Seroma risk in abdominal panniculectomy was 12 percent; in circumferential belt lipectomy, the risk was 18 percent; and in thigh lift, the risk was 4 percent. On multivariate statistical analysis, the major risk factor for seroma formation was weight of skin excised, with seroma risk increasing 9 percent for each additional pound of skin excised.

Conclusions

The most important risk factor for seroma is weight of skin excised at the time of surgery. Treatment strategies include aspiration, drain placement, sclerosis, and surgery.

### 154 compared to 54 mmol per liter of sodium in intravenous maintenance fluid therapy for adult patients undergoing major thoracic surgery (TOPMAST): a single-center randomized controlled double-blind trial [^112am28K]. Intensive Care Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Maintenance fluid therapy is prescribed to cover hospitalized patients' daily needs for water and electrolytes when they are unable to ingest food or fluids. They are routinely used in the daily care of hospitalized patients around the world. Evidence shows maintenance fluids are a more important source of potentially harmful fluid and electrolyte administration than resuscitation fluids, whose detrimental effects have received much more scientific attention. Maintenance fluid therapy should also be viewed separately from replacement solutions, which are used to substitute lost fluids or ongoing losses and need to contain as much sodium as the fluids lost.

For many years, guidelines have advised that maintenance solutions be hypotonic, reflecting dietary reference values, despite being based on low-quality evidence. This view was later challenged, most convincingly in a large-scale pediatric trial pointing out the increased risk of hyponatremia under hypotonic maintenance fluid therapy. Pediatric guidelines were subsequently adapted and even clinicians treating adult patients were soon called upon to change their practice accordingly, even in the absence of data in this population. The matter remains highly controversial, especially as the focus on hyponatremia detracts from the fact that also the choice of isotonic maintenance fluids comes at a price. It has been shown that even healthy adults with a normal kidney function need several days to realign renal sodium excretion with an abruptly increased sodium intake, causing fluid retention and body weight gain. The perioperative gain of 2–3 kg of body weight due to positive salt and water balance has been associated with detrimental effects and also in critically ill adult (and pediatric) patients a positive cumulative fluid balance is a risk factor for morbidity and mortality.

We designed the Tonicity Of Perioperative MAintenance SoluTions trial (TOPMAST) to test the hypothesis that maintenance fluid therapy containing 154 mmol per liter of sodium (as in the ubiquitous NaCl 0.9%) compared to 54 mmol per liter leads to increased fluid retention in adult patients undergoing major surgery. We also sought to evaluate different specific potential harms: the occurrence of sodium and chloride disturbances, renal injury and fluid-related clinical adverse events. Finally, we aimed to explore the study fluids' physiological behavior by measuring markers of volume status and capillary leakage.

### A prospective, randomized, multicenter trial assessing a novel lysine-derived urethane adhesive in a large flap surgical procedure without drains [^116RJcVB]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

The risk of fluid-related complications after large flap surgical procedures such as abdominoplasty is well documented, with incidences ranging from 15 to 52%. In this subset of patients, subcutaneous fluid continues to accumulate in the wound, leading to persistent seroma formation. The term seroma is inconsistently defined, but in general is considered to be a palpable collection of excess fluid between the tissue layers that cannot be fully absorbed. Seroma formation is regulated by the balance of secretion and reabsorption of fluid, and in cases where reabsorption cannot keep up with fluid output, the patient may require repeated aspirations to remove fluid from the wound. Excess fluid secretion leading to seroma formation is believed to result from the dead space created between the tissue layers during surgery, as well as from shearing forces between the underlying tissue and the abdominal flap after surgery.

### Retained surgical items and minimally invasive surgery [^112UUY3C]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Even though small incisions are made and few surgical items are used, minimally invasive surgery (MIS) cases are not immune to the problem of inadvertent surgical item retention. In the US and the UK, unintended retention of a surgical item in a patient after surgery is a reportable event. Retained surgical item (RSI) is now the preferred term (rather than retained foreign body or object) because foreign bodies can be any object found or left in a patient, e.g. bullets, coins, bottles, and shrapnel. RSI refers specifically to the surgical material (tools, supplies, and equipment) that is used by surgical providers to heal, but when inadvertently left in patients, can cause harm. An RSI is a surgical patient safety problem.

The minimal requirements for retention are a case in which an incision is made and surgical items are used inside the patient. This is true for all four classes of surgical items, i.e. sponges, needles, instruments, and miscellaneous small objects which must be accounted for before the patient leaves the operating or procedure room. RSI cases have been reported from around the world for decades, and surgical paraphernalia have been left in practically every body cavity after any kind of case. While reports in the early 2000s indicated there were patient-specific (obesity) and case-specific characteristics (emergencies) that increased the risk of retention, we now know that retention has very little to do with specific patients or the time of an operation and everything to do with the operating room culture and environment in which the patient has the operation. For example, more retained sponge cases occur in ordinary elective surgery cases. Retention has occurred in cases where only ten sponges were used, the surgical counts were performed, and the final count was called correct. When a sponge or item is recognized as missing (the final count was called incorrect) yet the patient leaves the OR with the item still inside occurs in the minority of cases.

### Closed-suction drainage in thoracolumbar spinal surgery-clinical routine without evidence? a systematic review [^113Ae87h]. European Spine Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The considered benefit of surgical drain use after spinal surgery is to prevent local accumulation of a haematoma by decompressing the closed space in the approach of the surgical site. In this context, the aim of the present systematic review was to prove the benefit of the routine use of closed-suction drains.

Methods

We conducted a comprehensive systematic review of the literature according to the Preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) checklist and algorithm.

Results

Following the literature search, 401 potentially eligible investigations were identified. Eventually, a total of 24 studies with 8579 participants were included. Negative suction drainage led to a significantly higher volume of drainage fluid. Drainage duration longer than 72 h may be associated with a higher incidence of Surgical side infections (SSI); however, accompanying antibiotic treatment is unnecessary. Regarding postoperative haematoma and neurological complications, no evidence exists concerning their prevention. Hospital stay length and related costs may be elevated in patients with drainage but appear to depend on surgery type.

Conclusions

With regard to the existing literature, the use of closed-suction drainage in elective thoracolumbar spinal surgery is not associated with any proven benefit for patients and cannot decrease postoperative complications.

### Delayed seroma formation secondary to docetaxel [^116ZyySg]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Docetaxel (Taxotere; Aventis, Bridgewater, NJ) binds to tubulin, leading to the stabilization of microtubules, resulting in interference with mitosis in the S phase. This antitumor drug has been instrumental in the treatment of metastatic and node-positive breast cancer. Although it can produce several undesirable side effects, many of these are tolerable and reversible. Of the more significant toxicities, neutropenia is dose-limiting but also resolves with drug cessation, and fluid retention is chronic and cumulative. The occurrence of edema in patients may be mitigated by premedication with antihistamines and corticosteroids. However, recurrence or appearance of localized fluid collections several years after surgery have not been previously reported in the literature. The authors describe a case of seroma formation 4 years postoperatively in a patient who was treated with docetaxel (Aventis) years after her breast reconstructive procedure. Although the development of a seroma in the immediate or acute postoperative period is a fairly common consequence after latissimus dorsi harvest, it is unusual for a fluid collection to recur several years after the procedure. Although, indeed, the authors have not established a definite causal relationship between seroma formation and docetaxel (Aventis), the authors believe it important to consider the possibility of such an occurrence in the management of this subset of patients.

### Artificial intelligence in the detection of non-biological materials [^1125kkDS]. Emergency Radiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Retained surgical bodies

Retained surgical bodies (RSB), such as sponges, sutures, needles, and other instruments, can engender dire consequences for patients and cause severe financial and legal ramifications for the involved medical institution. These reportable "never events" are rare, with certain studies estimating an incidence of 1 in every 5,500–7,000 procedures, with higher rates with abdominal surgeries of up to 1 RSB per 1000 surgeries. The actual number of cases with RSB is most likely underestimated due to low reporting rates of these incidents, and patients can be asymptomatic and, thus, unaware of their occurrence. Many authors note that the risk of this complication decreases if institutions follow the recommended perioperative and postoperative checklists and guidelines. Yet over 80% of operations noted to have RSB reported correct counts at the end of the case. As most RSB have standardized shapes and sizes, computer-aided detection (CAD) systems can be highly effective for identification.

Regarding the current imaging techniques to evaluate RSB, plain radiographs represent the gold standard imaging modality. On X-ray, retained objects often present as radiopacities with associated mass effect, mottled air, or density over surrounding soft tissues. One benefit of this modality is that most sponges have radiopaque markers that make them detectable on X-ray. However, these markers can become disfigured within the patient's body, so they are not a reliable detection source. Sponges without these markers are often visualized through cross-sectional imaging or radiographic visualization of radiolucency secondary to air trapping. Yet it is essential to note that false-negative radiographs can exist, with certain authors reporting that intraoperative radiographs can miss up to one-third of RSB (Fig. 1). Further, obtaining and reading a radiograph can be time-consuming, particularly after a surgical case. Thus, AI techniques can play a prominent role in quickly and accurately detecting RSB.

### Epidural cerebrospinal fluid collection after lumbar puncture [^116mpgEe]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2009). Low credibility.

Lumbar puncture is a common procedure in the emergency department. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak through a dural tear can cause transient side effects including headache and backache, although more severe symptoms may occur. These CSF collections can be managed nonoperatively without any neurologic sequelae. We report a patient with a symptomatic epidural CSF collection after diagnostic lumbar puncture, followed by a brief review of the literature including discussion of techniques that can reduce CSF leak.

### Risk factors for retained instruments and sponges after surgery [^116GQVtS]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

Risk factors for medical errors remain poorly understood. We performed a case-control study of retained foreign bodies in surgical patients in order to identify risk factors for this type of error.

Methods

We reviewed the medical records associated with all claims or incident reports of a retained surgical sponge or instrument filed between 1985 and 2001 with a large malpractice insurer representing one third of the physicians in Massachusetts. For each case, we identified an average of four randomly selected controls who underwent the same type of operation during the same six-month period.

Results

Our study included 54 patients with a total of 61 retained foreign bodies (of which 69 percent were sponges and 31 percent instruments) and 235 control patients. Thirty-seven of the patients with retained foreign bodies (69 percent) required reoperation, and one died. Patients with retained foreign bodies were more likely than controls to have had emergency surgery (33 percent vs. 7 percent, P < 0.001) or an unexpected change in surgical procedure (34 percent vs. 9 percent, P < 0.001). Patients with retained foreign bodies also had a higher mean body-mass index and were less likely to have had counts of sponges and instruments performed. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with a significantly increased risk of retention of a foreign body were emergency surgery (risk ratio, 8.8 [95 percent confidence interval, 2.4 to 31.9]), unplanned change in the operation (risk ratio, 4.1 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.4 to 12.4]), and body-mass index (risk ratio for each one-unit increment, 1.1 [95 percent confidence interval, 1.0 to 1.2]).

Conclusions

The risk of retention of a foreign body after surgery significantly increases in emergencies, with unplanned changes in procedure, and with higher body-mass index. Case — control analysis of medical-malpractice claims may identify and quantify risk factors for specific types of errors.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of selected ultrasound-guided procedures [^116ZQ7jq]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

Ultrasound-guided fluid aspiration — definition and indications — is defined as procedures in which real-time ultrasound visualization is used to guide a needle or catheter into a fluid collection (eg, cyst, seroma, ganglion, or abscess) for diagnostic or therapeutic aspiration, with general indications for placing a needle or catheter into a fluid collection including diagnostic aspiration for fluid analysis to exclude infection, metallosis, crystal disease, and other etiologies of abnormal fluid collections; therapeutic aspiration for symptomatic relief or to facilitate resolution of the fluid collection; installation of a catheter for therapeutic drainage of a fluid collection; and installation of therapeutic agents such as corticosteroids and sclerosing agents.

### Retained surgical items and minimally invasive surgery [^113uaHvL]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Ten years ago in a World Journal of Surgery review on intraperitoneal retained sponges, the authors brought attention to this unique surgical problem by pulling together the world's literature of cases and showed readers that these events were not rare and that they were preventable. They offered straightforward advice which ten years later we would consider individual vigilance actions: perform repeated sponge counts before and after each part of the operative procedure and use large radiopaque sponges one by one. These recommendations are not wrong but they reflect a predominant view of that time that through individual vigilance and individual effort retained sponges could be prevented. We now know that retained surgical items are system problems and cannot be prevented with just the effort of a single individual. System problems require system solutions, and while we still need our nursing colleagues to count sponges, we need even more for them to have in place a safe and reliable system that can account for the sponges. We need surgical technologists to know about the multiple parts of the equipment and devices we use and speak up if something is missing. We need radiology technologists to take high-quality and complete intraoperative films, and we need radiologists to interpret the images and share their findings expeditiously. We need anesthesiologists to monitor the use of the nonradiopaque sponges they use and keep the patient sedated if we need to prolong the operation a bit to find something that is missing. Most importantly we need surgeons to do their best to perform a methodical wound exam in every case before they ask for closing suture, and to create an operating room environment that promotes the exchange of knowledge and information. To ensure the safety of our surgical patients, together we must make sure there is "NoThing Left Behind".

### Outcome impact of individualized fluid management during spine surgery: a before-after prospective comparison study [^114Jv59B]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In patients undergoing major spine surgery, the implementation of IFM was associated with a significant decrease in postoperative complications that, however, did not impact hospital length of stay. Further studies are required to assess the economic impact.

### The intravascular volume effect of Ringer's lactate is below 20%: a prospective study in humans [^111ZLahk]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Introduction

Fluid homeostasis within the human body is the result of complex interactions between compartments and barriers and the prerequisite of stable hemodynamics. Severe intravascular hypovolemia is undesirable, being associated with a decreased cardiac output and leading to tissue hypoperfusion and organ dysfunction. Therefore, perioperative infusion therapy should avoid these complications by replacing blood and fluid losses as timely and adequately as possible. However, discussions on the adequate type, composition and amount of fluids are ongoing. While replacement of crystalloidal extracellular losses, such as urinary output and insensible perspiration, using isotonic crystalloids seems rational, there are controversial opinions for maintaining or restoring cardiac preload. Theoretical physiological considerations on vascular barrier properties may suggest a possible advantage of artificial colloids or natural proteins: iso-oncotic preparations are believed to remain within the intravascular space while crystalloids should distribute evenly across the whole extracellular compartment, that is, to 80% interstitially. Surprisingly, a prospective randomized trial on 6,997 critically ill patients showed no differences in mortality or organ dysfunction when using either human albumin or crystalloids for resuscitation guided by common hemodynamical surrogates. Furthermore, the authors observed only a slight difference of the total infused amount of the respective solutions. Despite the fact that these patients might have had, at least partly, an altered vascular barrier, one important question increasingly arose: is our historical belief in a superior volume effect of colloids in comparison to crystalloids just a physiological myth that should urgently be adapted to clinical reality?

This study assessed, in the highly standardized setup of preoperative acute normovolemic hemodilution combined with repeated direct blood volume assessments, the actual volume effect of an isotonic crystalloid when applied as a substitute of artificial acute blood loss in patients. Presumably, the vascular barrier primarily was sufficient and endothelial and capillary functioning was normal in our model. We hypothesized a relevant (> 10%) and significant decrease in blood volume when using Ringer's lactate for this indication, the primary study endpoint being blood volume (ml) after hemodilution. Beyond that, the capacity of hyperoncotic (20%) human albumin to recruit interstitially lost fluid for cardiac preload was investigated.

### Evaluation and management of abdominal lymphoceles after anterior lumbar spine surgery [^116qj42x]. Spine (2008). Low credibility.

Study Design

Case report.

Objective

To examine the management of abdominal lymphoceles after anterior spine surgery and to review the existing literature on lymphoceles after access to the spine.

Summary Of Background Data

Abdominal lymphoceles are a rare complication of anterior spinal approaches.

Methods

Case report and review of the literature.

Results

In this article, we describe the management of 2 lymphoceles. In the first case, immediate operative drainage was required because of worsening abdominal pain and distention. In the second patient, conservative management was attempted, but the lymphocele ultimately persisted and required surgical intervention.

Conclusion

Lymphoceles are often difficult to distinguish from ureteral injury, cerebrospinal fluid-leaks and hematomas using conventional imaging techniques. Although surgery remains the gold standard for the treatment of lymphoceles, expectant observation may be reasonable in some situations.

### Clinical practice guidelines for enhanced recovery after colon and rectal surgery from the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons and the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons [^112H8SkR]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2023). High credibility.

Fluid management — fluid administration should be tailored to avoid excessive fluid administration and volume overload or undue fluid restriction and hypovolemia. Grade of recommendation: strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence, 1A. The overall goal of fluid management should typically be a positive fluid balance at the end of surgery of ~1 L to avoid hypovolemia and AKI while limiting substantial postoperative weight gain (> 2.5 kg/d), which is associated with increased morbidity and prolonged hospital stay. Although a zero-balance approach might improve postoperative GI function, it is associated with a slightly increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI) (8.6% versus 5.0% in an RCT of 300 patients undergoing major abdominal surgery).

### Postoperative urinary retention [^112k6i9d]. Urogynecology (2023). High credibility.

Postoperative urinary retention (POUR) in women — risk factors and clinical impact are characterized by evidence that anesthetic type, lack of intraoperative bladder drainage, and postoperative medication use are common contributors, that patient factors (medical history, prolapse stage, preexisting urinary symptoms, preoperative urodynamics) are associated with POUR, and that perioperative factors (surgical route, concomitant procedures, surgical length, blood loss, anesthesia type, perioperative medications, intraoperative fluid management, postoperative pain control) may contribute. Although POUR in women is common, temporary, and often inconsequential to the surgical outcome, POUR interventions can increase the risk of urinary tract infections and decrease patient satisfaction; therefore, clinical actions around POUR should be standardized and guided by the available evidence and supplemented by expert opinion where needed.

### An international consensus statement on the management of postoperative anaemia after major surgical procedures [^113pJkoV]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

What are the confounding factors?

In the setting of postoperative care, a number of confounding factors may impact on accurate haemoglobin measurement. Volume overload and haemodilution after major surgery are potential causes for low haemoglobin levels, despite normal and stable red cell mass. Therefore, the diagnosis of anaemia based on simple haemoglobin concentration may be misleading, and is confounded by plasma volume derangements, resulting in significant overdiagnosis 37. Potential volume overload should be taken into account, and may improve after diuresis.

Similar conditions may be present in the peri‐operative setting where prevention of intravascular volume deficit is a cornerstone of peri‐operative management. Here, intravascular volume and fluid therapy are fundamental whenever fasting is indicated for medical reasons; in the event of high‐fluid turnover rates during major surgery, or in cases of reduced enteral resorption due to sustained vomiting, severe diarrhoea or gastro‐intestinal dysfunction following circulatory shock. The primary aim of intravenous fluid therapy (crystalloid and colloid solutions) is the restoration of plasma and blood volume to ensure appropriate cardiac output and tissue perfusion.

Unfortunately, appropriate assessment of volume status is complex. The diagnosis or quantification of moderate‐to‐severe volume deficit and volume responsiveness remains difficult, and may be attempted using laboratory variables (e.g. lactate, base excess), positional manoeuvres (passive lifting of legs), new monitoring devices (measuring pulse variability and stroke volume indexes or other preload variables) or echocardiography. Recent guidelines highlight the importance of avoiding hypervolaemia 7. During postoperative recovery, redistribution and excretion of fluids may lead to rapid recovery of haemodilution‐induced low haemoglobin concentrations.

Urogynecology (2022). High credibility.

AUGS-IUGA ERAS intraoperative management for urogynecologic surgery includes a standard anesthetic protocol with Use of short-acting anesthetic agents, Complete reversal of neuromuscular blockade, Lung-protective ventilatory management, and Intraoperative multimodal analgesia. Perioperative fluid management specifies that the goal of intraoperative fluid administration should be euvolemia; 2 mL/kg/hr is an approximate volume for intraoperative fluid replacement with boluses of crystalloid or colloid when needed, balanced salt solutions should be used over normal saline, and IV fluids should be discontinued once the patient is tolerating oral hydration.

### A rational approach to perioperative fluid management [^117S2mAt]. Anesthesiology (2008). Low credibility.

Replacement of assumed preoperative deficits, in addition to generous substitution of an unsubstantiated increased insensible perspiration and third space loss, plays an important role in current perioperative fluid regimens. The consequence is a positive fluid balance and weight gain of up to 10 kg, which may be related to severe complications. Because the intravascular blood volume remains unchanged and insensible perspiration is negligible, the fluid must accumulate inside the body. This concept brings into question common liberal infusion regimens. Blood volume after fasting is normal, and a fluid-consuming third space has never been reliably shown. Crystalloids physiologically load the interstitial space, whereas colloidal volume loading deteriorates a vital part of the vascular barrier. The endothelial glycocalyx plays a key role and is destroyed not only by ischemia and surgery, but also by acute hypervolemia. Therefore, undifferentiated fluid handling may increase the shift toward the interstitial space. Using the right kind of fluid in appropriate amounts at the right time might improve patient outcome.

### Postoperative spinal hematoma and seroma [^113gopNa]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2023). Medium credibility.

Fluid collections after spine surgery are rare complications, although potentially grave, and may be broadly grouped into two major categories. Symptomatic postoperative epidural hematomas have some known risk factors and can present with a widely variable profile of signs and symptoms. Treatment involves emergent surgical evacuation to reduce the risk of permanent neurologic deficit. Postoperative seroma may lead to disruption of wound healing and deep infection and has been associated with the use of recombinant human bone mineral protein. These diagnoses may present diagnostic challenges; thorough understanding of the involved pathophysiology, meticulous clinical evaluation, and radiographic interpretation are critical to appropriate management and optimal outcome.

### Incidental durotomy in lumbar spine surgery; risk factors, complications, and perioperative management [^113W4JbU]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2021). Medium credibility.

Incidental durotomy (ID) can occur in up to 14% of all lumbar spine surgeries. The risk of this complication is markedly higher among elderly patients with advanced spinal pathology. In addition, revision cases and other more invasive procedures increase the risk of ID. When unrepaired, IDs can increase the risk of developing meningitis and can lead to the formation of cerebrospinal fluid fistulas and pseudomeningoceles. Intraoperative recognition and repair are essential to ID management, although repair techniques vary considerably. Although primary suture repair is considered the "benchmark", indirect repair alone has shown comparable outcomes. Given the concern for infection after ID, many have indicated for prolonged prophylactic antibiotic regimens. However, there is little clinical evidence that this is necessary after adequate repair. The addition of subfascial drains have been shown to promote wound healing and early ambulation, whereas no consensus on duration of indwelling drains exists and such management is largely case dependent. Early ambulation after surgery has not shown to be associated with increased risk of further ID complications and decreases rehabilitation time, length of stay, and risk of venous thromboembolism. However, there remains a role for conservation mobilization protocols in more severe cases where notable symptoms are observed.

### Postoperative spinal CT: what the radiologist needs to know [^117UBgix]. Radiographics (2019). Medium credibility.

During the past 2 decades, the number of spinal surgeries performed annually has been steadily increasing, and these procedures are being accompanied by a growing number of postoperative imaging studies to interpret. CT is accurate for identifying the location and integrity of implants, assessing the success of decompression and intervertebral arthrodesis procedures, and detecting and characterizing related complications. Although postoperative spinal CT is often limited owing to artifacts caused by metallic implants, parameter optimization and advanced metal artifact reduction techniques, including iterative reconstruction and monoenergetic extrapolation methods, can be used to reduce metal artifact severity and improve image quality substantially. Commonly used and recently available spinal implants and prostheses include screws and wires, static and extendable rods, bone grafts and biologic materials, interbody cages, and intervertebral disk prostheses. CT assessment and the spectrum of complications that can occur after spinal surgery and intervertebral arthroplasty include those related to the position and integrity of implants and prostheses, adjacent segment degeneration, collections, fistulas, pseudomeningoceles, cerebrospinal fluid leaks, and surgical site infections. Knowledge of the numerous spinal surgery techniques and devices aids in differentiating expected postoperative findings from complications. The various types of spinal surgery instrumentation and commonly used spinal implants are reviewed. The authors also describe and illustrate normal postoperative spine findings, signs of successful surgery, and the broad spectrum of postoperative complications that can aid radiologists in generating reports that address issues that the surgeon needs to know for optimal patient management. © RSNA, 2019.

### Fluid replacement in craniofacial pediatric surgery: normal saline or Ringer's lactate? [^112D2nbm]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Introduction

Pediatric craniofacial surgery requires large amounts of intravenous fluid replacement that may alter the ionic composition of body compartments. Normal (0.9%) saline (NS) and Ringer's lactate (RL) solutions are commonly used, with different advantages and disadvantages. Our hypothesis was that there would be more acidosis with NS but with no advantage of NS over RL regarding the incidence of hyponatremia. Our objective was to determine whether acid-base and electrolyte outcomes could guide fluid management in this group of patients.

Methods

A retrospective study of 122 children younger than 5 years who underwent craniofacial surgery was performed: 63 received only NS (NS group) and 59 received RL (RL group). Blood gases, plasma sodium, and potassium concentrations were analyzed during 2 different periods: 1 to 2 hours from anesthetic induction (P-1) and 2 to 4 hours from anesthetic induction (P-2). Statistical comparisons were made with χ test and t-test, as appropriate.

Results

Acidosis was more frequent in NS group than in RL patients during P-1 and P-2: 66% and 80% in the NS group versus 26% and 37% in the RL group. Severe acidosis (pH ≤ 7.25) was also more frequently in those receiving NS (39%) than RL (8%); and so was a base excess of -5 or less: NS = 53% and RL = 16%. The incidence of hyponatremia (Na < 135 mmol/L) was similar in both groups: 40% (NS) and 26% (RL) during P-1 and 52% (NS) and 50% (RL) during P-2.

Conclusions

In young children undergoing craniofacial surgery, RL may be a preferred crystalloid over NS because metabolic acidosis is less frequent, with no increased incidence of hyponatremia.

### Cerebrospinal fluid and lumbar puncture: a practical review [^111QCwFW]. Journal of Neurology (2012). Low credibility.

Cerebrospinal fluid is vital for normal brain function. Changes to the composition, flow, or pressure can cause a variety of neurological symptoms and signs. Equally, disorders of nervous tissue may alter cerebrospinal fluid characteristics. Analysis of cerebrospinal fluid can provide information on diagnosis, may be therapeutic in certain conditions, and allows a research opportunity into neurological disease. However, inappropriate sampling, inaccurate technique, and incomplete analysis can contribute to significant patient morbidity, and reduce the amount of accurate information obtained. In this article, we will review how cerebrospinal fluid is produced, circulated, and resorbed. We will also review lumbar puncture technique, equipment, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis. We also discuss how to minimize the risks and address the complications associated with lumbar puncture.

### A prospective, randomized, multicenter trial assessing a novel lysine-derived urethane adhesive in a large flap surgical procedure without drains [^117ADECx]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Outcome Measures

The present study was designed as a non-inferiority study in order to test the hypothesis that the use of the lysine-derived urethane adhesive, without the concomitant use of drains, could provide a less invasive alternative to the use of drains for the management of fluid accumulation following a common large flap surgical procedure. In order to normalize the treatment modalities and effectively compare the two groups, the primary endpoint for the study was defined as the number of post-operative invasive procedures. Removal of an indwelling drain was counted as a single invasive procedure, as was a percutaneous needle aspiration. This design takes into account the fact that an indwelling drain is an invasive method of managing post-operative fluid. While it would be possible to design an outcome measure that takes into account the number of days an indwelling drain was in place, this study design focused on singular events that could be reasonably compared. As a result, removal of one drain was scored as a single invasive procedure regardless of the number of days it had been in place and represents the entire treatment process of having that drain in place.

Using the number of post-operative invasive procedures, the frequency of invasive management of the fluid-related complications (such as needle aspiration or removal of post-operative drains) can be captured and compared in an unbiased manner between test and control conditions. Our study hypothesis was that the elimination of dead space in the wound in the Treatment group would reduce the number of invasive procedures related to post-operative fluid management and the Treatment group would not be inferior to the Control group.

Secondary endpoints for the study included cumulative drain volume, aspiration volume, total wound drainage (drain volume + aspiration volume), cumulative days of invasive treatment (days with drains in + days aspirated), and days to drain removal. A patient questionnaire that evaluated Quality of Life measures related to resuming normal activities was also administered during the study. Seroma rate (defined as a clinically detectable palpable fluid collection requiring needle aspiration) was also documented. However, it should be recognized that in a treatment paradigm that involves an adhesive and not drains, percutaneous aspiration is the only method used for managing post-operative fluid collections, and that any fluid collection treated is classified as a seroma. Conversely, in the Control group, all subjects have indwelling drains, an invasive treatment to control fluid, and seroma is only diagnosed and treated with a second invasive therapy after the drains are removed.

### Postoperative diabetes insipidus: how to define and grade this complication? [^113pfHkw]. Pituitary (2021). Medium credibility.

Evaluation of the condition and proposal for grading of complication

Postoperative fluid imbalances, differential diagnosis and contributing components

Fluid imbalances are highly prevalent after pituitary surgery (50–75.4% of cases) and are often a consequence of perioperative administration of high volumes of intravenous fluids and physiological adaptation of patients to a variety of stressors. The posterior pituitary gland plays a major role in fluid homeostasis which makes patients undergoing pituitary surgery more vulnerable to fluid imbalances due to insufficient or inappropriate vasopressin release. Polyuria following pituitary surgery can be the physiological response to fluid overload, but also the manifestation of osmotic diuresis or DI. The core symptoms of these causes of polyuria are summarized in Table 2.

Table 2
Diagnostic criteria for different states of fluid imbalances

USG Urine Specific Gravity

Postoperative polyuria due to fluid overload

During pituitary surgery, the vast majority of patient receive large amounts of intravenous fluids. Based on sympathetic stimulation during surgery vasopressin and aldosterone secretion is stimulated, promoting fluid retention. Moreover, patients often receive supraphysiologic dosages of glucocorticoids, which further promotes vasopressin release as well as water and salt retention via mineralocorticoid receptor stimulation in the kidneys. After surgery, vasopressin, aldosterone, and glucocorticoid concentrations decrease, resulting in the release of the retained fluids. This form of polyuria is transient in case of normal posterior pituitary function as adequate control of vasopressin release will normalize urinary output and restore fluid imbalances after excretion of the surplus of fluids.

A condition-specific form of postoperative polyuria occurs in patients with acromegaly and Cushing's disease. In acromegaly, fluid and sodium retention occur as the result of the growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) excess. Consequently, abrogation of GH excess by successful adenectomy will result in a negative fluid balance during the first 48 h after surgery. In Cushing's disease, cortisol excess facilitates fluid and sodium retention via overstimulation of mineralocorticoid receptors in the kidneys, whereas successful reduction of cortisol secretion will also result in increased fluid excretion.

Osmotic diuresis

Osmotic diuresis can occur as a result of glycosuria in patients with uncontrolled or undiagnosed diabetes mellitus or patients receiving high doses of corticosteroids. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is higher both in acromegaly and Cushing's disease patients due to the hormone excess.

### ACR appropriateness criteria radiologic management of infected fluid collections [^113SAe85]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

The best management of infected fluid collections depends on a careful assessment of clinical and anatomic factors as well as an up-to-date review of the published literature, to be able to select from a host of multidisciplinary treatment options. This article reviews conservative, radiologic, endoscopic, and surgical options and their best application to infected fluid collections as determined by the ACR Appropriateness Criteria Expert Panel on Interventional Radiology. The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed every three years by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and review include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer-reviewed journals, and the application, by the panel, of a well-established consensus methodology (modified Delphi) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures. In those instances in which evidence is lacking or not definitive, expert opinion may be used to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Developing a spinal CSF leak program in a multihospital network [^117VVzNw]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Spontaneous spinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leaks are rare and challenging to diagnose and treat. Patients may present to a variety of physicians, and many patients are often referred to a specialized center with a dedicated spinal CSF leak program and expertise in this condition. To our knowledge, there are no reported publications on how to create such a program.

Conclusion

In this article, we describe the specific steps we took to develop a spinal CSF leak program, which we have implemented over a multihospital network.

### Postoperative urinary retention [^111tijEq]. Urogynecology (2023). High credibility.

Postoperative urinary retention (POUR) — other perioperative factors: Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that the use of phenazopyridine does not decrease the risk of POUR in patients having midurethral sling (MUS) or pelvic organ prolapse surgical procedures. There is evidence to suggest that minimizing surgery time may reduce the risk of POUR. The data are conflicting regarding the amount of blood loss during surgery and the risk of POUR. There is no evidence that higher levels of intraoperative fluid intake increase the risk of POUR. There is no evidence that higher levels of postoperative fluid intake increase the risk of POUR.

### Outcome impact of individualized fluid management during spine surgery: a before-after prospective comparison study [^117NPW9y]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Intraoperative fluid management is a major determinant of postoperative outcome in various types of surgery. Both insufficient and excessive fluid administration are associated with adverse events. In patients undergoing major surgery, individualized fluid management (IFM) has been proposed to tailor fluid administration to individual needs. Multicentre randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses suggest that IFM is beneficial in decreasing postoperative morbidity, shortening hospital length of stay and saving costs. Most IFM studies have been conducted in patients undergoing major gastro-intestinal surgery. A limited number of studies have been done among patients undergoing orthopaedic surgery and have yielded conflicting results. For instance, in patients undergoing hip fracture surgery, a few studies reported clinical benefits when using IFM, whereas others did not. In addition, it remains unclear whether clinical benefits reported by RCTs are reproducible in real life conditions. The implementation of IFM require education, experience in using hemodynamic monitoring tools, as well as focus and time during the procedure to ensure optimal protocol adherence.

Spine surgery represents a particularly challenging setting for intraoperative fluid management. Prone positioning during the surgery is associated with physiological changes and the surgery itself is associated with significant intraoperative blood loss and postoperative complications. Surprisingly, little is known about the impact of IFM in this specific context. Therefore, we designed a before-after comparison study to investigate the impact of IFM implementation on the postoperative outcome of patients undergoing major spine surgery.

### Does an unintended durotomy in metastatic spine surgery lead to shorter survival? [^115Run43]. Neurosurgery Practice (2024). Medium credibility.

Vertebral column metastases occur in 60% to 70% of patients with systemic cancer. As life expectancies rise due to advances in cancer therapies, the incidence of spinal metastases has been increasing. Spinal metastases can lead to back pain, mechanical instability, and paralysis, and surgical intervention can decompress the neural elements and stabilize an otherwise unstable spine. However, metastatic spine surgery carries high complication rates. One such complication, as in any spine surgery, is an unintended durotomy.

Patients undergoing surgery for extradural spinal metastases are at risk for unintended dural breach and subsequent cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, with Ropper et alreporting an intraoperative durotomy rate of 11.4%. Previous studies in the spine literature have demonstrated that both unintended durotomies and CSF leaks are associated with a multitude of additional complications, including increased risk of infection, delayed wound healing, and in severe cases, posterior fossa hemorrhage due to intracranial hypotension. Dural breach is particularly concerning in patients with epidural metastases, given the possibility of intradural spread to the central nervous system (CNS). Kasliwal et alreported 2 patients in whom local tumors recurred intradurally after extradural metastasis resection that was complicated by unintended durotomy. Although a dural breach may theoretically disperse tumor cells in the subarachnoid space, whether an unintended durotomy increases the risk of CNS spread and worsened survival remains unknown.

Understanding the consequences of an unintended durotomy in spinal metastasis surgery outcomes may help surgeons develop improved surgical techniques and perioperative management strategies to minimize the risk of this complication and optimize patient outcomes. In patients undergoing spine surgery for extradural metastasis, we sought to (1) determine the rate of unintended durotomy, (2) identify the preoperative and perioperative factors that increase the risk of unintended durotomy, and (3) determine whether unintended durotomy affects local recurrence (LR), any spinal recurrence, and overall survival (OS).

### Postoperative urinary retention [^111ds9ro]. Urogynecology (2023). High credibility.

Postoperative urinary retention (POUR) management and delayed POUR — patient/provider preferences, conservative strategies, and observed risks are summarized as follows: Preference for bladder drainage method is varied, with evidence that patients prefer suprapubic catheterization, urogynecology surgeons prefer transurethral indwelling catheters or intermittent self-catheterization, and in-hospital nurses prefer transurethral indwelling catheters. The conservative management of POUR after MUS includes continuous bladder drainage or intermittent catheterization, and most studies include small numbers and are descriptive; studies of postoperative mobilization or loosening of the MUS report high rates of POUR resolution but persistence of irritative voiding symptoms and recurrence of SUI. Delayed POUR, where a patient initially passes a VT then later presents in retention, is described as uncommon; in a case-control study after POP and/or SUI surgery, voided volume on VT was the only factor associated with delayed POUR, the median time to resolution after diagnosis was 7 days, and there was a high prevalence (74.5%) of UTI at catheter removal; the authors concluded that standard testing for UTI should be considered in all patients that present with delayed POUR.

### The intravascular volume effect of Ringer's lactate is below 20%: a prospective study in humans [^1155wWb9]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this prospective investigation on patients being primarily in a cardiocirculatory steady-state, all participants were significantly hypovolemic compared to the starting point after an acute blood loss and simultaneous substitution with the three-fold amount of Ringer's lactate. This effect was associated with a significant fluid storage outside the circulation and a marked reduction of an important structure concerning vascular barrier functioning. The shift outward by more than 80% of the infused amount of crystalloid was completed within 30 minutes after the end of the hemodilution, being much faster than generally assumed.

Normovolemic hemodilution is a well established blood conservation technique, reducing the requirement for allogeneic red cell transfusions. Autologous blood is safely stored outside the circulation prior to elective surgery and retransfused if required. During withdrawal, the whole blood is replaced simultaneously by an artificial solution in order to maintain the quantitative component of cardiac preload. From a scientific point of view, this preoperative intervention can be comprised as simulation of accidental bleeding and therapeutical infusion therapy. The intravascular volume effect of the chosen substitute, that is, that part remaining within the circulation after intravenous infusion, determines the required amount to establish or maintain intravascular normovolemia. A volume effect of, for example, 100% means that substitution of an equal amount as withdrawn is necessary, whereas an effect of 50% would require double the amount. In the latter case, the excessive part of the infused amount is excreted via the kidneys and/or shifted toward the interstitial space.

### Delayed lymphocele formation following lateral lumbar interbody fusion of the spine [^113fTHzM]. European Spine Journal (2017). Low credibility.

Purpose

This paper aims to describe the rare post-operative complication of a lymphocele formation after lateral lumbar interbody fusion.

Methods

The patient in this case was a 76-year-old lady with a 10 year history of low back pain and neurogenic claudication. She had previously underwent multiple spine surgeries for her condition. She presented to our institution for a recurrence of her low back pain and right anterior thigh pain. She then underwent surgery in two stages; first, a mini-open lateral interbody fusion at L3/4 and L4/5; second, posterior instrumentation of T3 to S1 with sagittal spinal deformity correction.

Results

The patient recovered uneventfully in the initial post op period and was discharged within 8 days. However, she developed abdominal distension and discomfort 6 months after surgery. MRI and CT scan of her abdomen showed a retroperitoneal fluid collection compressing her left ureter, resulting in hydroureter and hydronephrosis. She was managed with a CT-guided drainage of the fluid collection. Fluid analysis was consistent with a lymphocele. Since the procedure, the patient has been asymptomatic for 2 years.

Conclusions

Delayed lymphocele formation is a potential complication of lateral lumbar interbody fusion. When present, it can be managed conservatively with good results. This case suggests that surgeons should have a low threshold to investigate for a lymphocele development post-anterior or lateral lumbar spine surgery. The authors recommend the placement of a post surgical retroperitoneal drain, as it might assist in the early detection of a lymphocele formation.

### Prolonged international normalized ratio correlates with a large intravascular fluid balance after major abdominal surgery [^112RqeLV]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2006). Low credibility.

We performed a prospective randomized study of 32 patients who had undergone pancreaticoduodenectomy and did not receive blood during and after surgery. The patients were prospectively assigned to two groups related to fluid balance in the immediate postoperative period. Group 1 (14 patients) were maintained at a positive intravascular fluid balance of 0–1000 mL; Group 2 (18 patients) were maintained at a positive balance of 1000–2000 mL. Complete blood counts and coagulation tests (International Normalized Ratio) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) were performed at three time points: the day before surgery, on arrival at the postanesthesia care unit, and on leaving the postanesthesia care unit (16 h later). There were significant differences in International Normalized Ratio values between the groups with deterioration during the time they were in the postanesthesia care unit but not in aPTT values. Positive correlation was found between the amount of positive fluid balance and International Normalized Ratio prolongation, but not with aPTT, suggesting that restricted intravascular fluid balance is beneficial for preservation of coagulation after major abdominal surgery.

Practice advisory — Management of blood loss and administration of fluids in high-risk patients recommends periodic monitoring of hemoglobin or hematocrit during surgery when substantial blood loss occurs, use of transfusions as deemed appropriate, and that crystalloids or colloids alone or in combination may be used to maintain adequate intravascular volume replacement. The Task Force states there is no documented lower hemoglobin limit associated with perioperative visual loss and therefore no transfusion threshold can be established to eliminate anemia-related risk.

### Case report: inflammatory pseudotumor in the lung parenchyma caused by a medical suture originating from a cardiac surgery 35 years ago [^115sJ2Bi]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

The iatrogenic foreign body retained after surgery is a serious medical fault, and its incidence is extremely low under the current strict and standardized medical procedures. Iatrogenic foreign body retained is surrounded by normal tissue, which responds to foreign matter to form inflammatory pseudotumors. Surgical sponge or swap is the most common type of foreign body. There were no reports of medical sutures remaining as foreign bodies in the lung parenchyma to form inflammatory pseudotumors.

### Gentamicin sulfate (gentamicin) [^114jrkxD]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Since gentamicin is distributed in extra-cellular fluid, peak serum concentrations may be lower than usual in adult patients who have a large volume of this fluid. Serum concentrations of gentamicin in febrile patients may be lower than those in afebrile patients given the same dose. When body temperature returns to normal, serum concentrations of the drug may rise. Febrile and anemic states may be associated with a shorter than usual serum half-life. (Dosage adjustment is usually not necessary.) In severely burned patients, the half-life may be significantly decreased and resulting serum concentrations may be lower than anticipated from the mg/kg dose.

Protein binding studies have indicated that the degree of gentamicin binding is low; depending upon the methods used for testing, this may be between 0 and 30%.

After initial administration to patients with normal renal function, generally 70% or more of the gentamicin dose is recoverable in the urine in 24 hours; concentrations in urine above 100 mcg/mL may be achieved. Little, if any, metabolic transformation occurs; the drug is excreted principally by glomerular filtration. After several days of treatment, the amount of gentamicin excreted in the urine approaches the daily dose administered. As with other aminoglycosides, a small amount of the gentamicin dose may be retained in the tissues, especially in the kidneys. Minute quantities of aminoglycosides have been detected in the urine weeks after drug administration was discontinued. Renal clearance of gentamicin is similar to that of endogenous creatinine.

### Retained foreign bodies after surgery [^116HD72h]. The Journal of Surgical Research (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Medical errors during surgery are not well studied. To define risk factors associated with this type of error, we performed a case control analysis.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed medical records involving the ICD-9 code (998.4) for unintentional foreign object remaining in the body during surgery and incident reports gathered by the Department of Risk Management over a 10 year period from 1996 to 2005. Thirty cases were matched with at least four randomly selected controls (131 control patients) that underwent the same type of operation during the same time period.

Results

Thirty patients had retained foreign objects (52% sponges and 43% instruments). The abdominal cavity was most commonly involved (46%) followed by the thoracic cavity (23%) although no body cavity remained uninvolved. Eight patients required readmission (30%), 25 patients required reoperation (83%), and there was no mortality. When compared with controls, patients with retained foreign objects were more likely to have had a greater number of major surgical procedures at the same time (2.7 versus 1.8, P = 0.004), to have multiple surgical teams (13% versus 2%, P = 0.02), and more likely to have had an incorrect instrument/sponge count recorded (13% versus 2%, P = 0.01). In multivariate analysis, factors associated with a significantly higher risk of retained foreign objects were the total number of major procedures performed [odds ratio 1.6; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1–2.3; P = 0.008] and an incorrect count (odds ratio 16.2; 95% CI, 1.3–197.8; P = 0.02).

Conclusion

Retained foreign objects after surgery are associated with multiple major surgical procedures being performed at the same time and an incorrect instrument or sponge count. Identification of these risk factors using case-control analysis should influence operating room policy and reduce these types of errors.

### Sodium chloride, sodium lactate, potassium chloride and calcium chloride (lactated Ringer's irrigation) [^114tHNuN]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Possible adverse effects arising from the irrigation of body cavities, tissues, or indwelling catheters and tubes are usually avoidable when proper procedures are followed. Displaced catheters or drainage tubes can lead to irrigation or infiltration of unintended structures or cavities. Excessive volume or pressure during irrigation of closed cavities may cause undue distension or disruption of tissues. Accidental contamination from careless technique may transmit infection.

Should any adverse reaction occur, discontinue the irrigant, evaluate the patient, institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary.

### Postoperative fluid collections after lumbar spine surgery: differential diagnosis and surgical considerations [^111kmJcy]. Radiographics (2025). Medium credibility.

Postoperative fluid collections are commonly encountered at imaging after lumbar spine surgery. While small collections usually resolve on their own, larger or more complex ones have a limited differential diagnosis. Varied surgical approaches to the lumbar spine may predispose patients to different types of fluid collections, including seromas, hematomas, pseudomeningoceles, abscesses, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-related collections, lymphoceles, and urinomas; thus, radiologists should be aware of the different types of anterior and posterior surgical approaches to lumbar spine interbody fusion. Hematomas and abscesses may occur with any surgical approach. Pseudomeningoceles most frequently result after posterior approach surgery, while urinomas and lymphoceles more likely develop after anterior approach surgery due to the close proximity of the surgical corridor to the nephroureteral system or lymphatics, respectively. Surgical implants or biologics used at surgery can lead to BMP-related collections; awareness of any implanted materials intraoperatively can be helpful at the time of interpretation. While MRI is most frequently used for identifying fluid collections in the postoperative spine, CT can serve as an important adjunct. CT myelography can be used to confirm or exclude the presence of a pseudomeningocele but may not be necessary if MRI shows a confirmatory flow jet, confirming leakage of cerebrospinal fluid into the pseudomeningocele. CT enhanced with intravenous contrast material during the excretory phase also allows confirmation of the presence of a urinoma. When the contents of a postoperative fluid collection remain uncertain, aspiration may be necessary. Accurate diagnosis of the type of postoperative collection is extremely useful in guiding patient management and determining prognosis. © RSNA, 2025.

### Fluid levels in medical imaging [^116b2ae1]. Clinical Radiology (2007). Low credibility.

Fluid levels are commonly observed on a range of imaging methods in both normal and abnormal circumstances. Radiologists must be familiar with the appearances and significance of fluid levels, but more fundamentally, require an understanding of the mechanisms by which fluid levels occur and the principles necessary for the demonstration of fluid levels. These are the prerequisites of a cavity and at least two types of immiscible fluid, and most importantly, the requirement of an image that is orientated in the vertical plane.

### Spinal anesthesia and digital anxiolysis (SPIDA) for the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis-a feasibility study [^114E2xid]. Neurosurgical Review (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This is the first study showing the feasibility of the combination of digital anxiolysis and spinal anesthesia for the microsurgical treatment of LSS. Patients treated with the SPIDA-Bundle demonstrated compelling satisfaction with the procedure, with further outcome parameters comparable to those with General Anesthesia. Therefore, this approach is worth further prospective, multicenter, and randomized investigations in the future.

LSS is common, especially in elderly patients. Thereby, patients suffering from both severe leg and back pain benefit from surgical decompressions. In neurosurgery, particularly lumbar operations, the evolution of surgical and anesthetic techniques has led to the exploration of methods to enhance patient comfort and reduce intraoperative stress. Therefore, awake surgery under SA is an alternative to surgery under GA in neurological and spine surgery. This technique allows for the preservation of consciousness and significantly reduces the risks associated with general anesthesia, especially in patients with complex medical conditions. Particularly due to the increasing life expectancy and the consequent globally rising number of elderly patients undergoing spinal surgeries, it appears prudent to reduce the burden of anesthesia during the operative procedures. Meta-analysis encompassing various types of spine surgeries (including fusions, decompressions, and kyphoplasties) demonstrated that patients undergoing awake spine surgery with SA experienced notably shorter durations of operations and hospital stays, along with reduced incidences of postoperative nausea and urinary retention, in comparison to those receiving GA. Despite the potential benefits, the practice of awake spine surgery has yet to gain widespread acceptance. A survey examining surgeons' perspectives uncovered considerable skepticism. One of the present authors' concerns was that patients after spinal SA cannot be neurologically examined immediately after the surgery, unlike with GA after extubating. However, in the context of this feasibility study, we have no cases to report where the ability to perform examinations delayed surgical follow-up care, such as for a postoperative hemorrhage. Nevertheless, future studies should remain attentive and investigate events such as the described cerebrospinal fluid leak caused by spinal puncture. Notably, the current study was underpowered for the investigation of complications, necessitating further research in this area.

### The grading model for the assessment of the total amount of epidural fibrosis in postoperative lumbar spine [^112hRj6U]. European Spine Journal (2013). Low credibility.

Discussion

EF is one of several major causes of failed back surgery. Since the presence of EF makes surgical dissection difficult, lumbar revision surgery bears a high risk of intraoperative complications (e.g. bleeding, nerve root lesions, dural tears). To facilitate tissue dissection and entry into the spinal canal and to reduce the operative complications and surgical time, mucolytic agents for chemical dissection of EF have been developed. In addition, some agents decrease not only the amount of EF, but also the tenacity of EF which makes lumbar revision surgery easier with fewer complications. So far, MRI is the only possible method for evaluation of in vivo efficiency of medicines that inhibit scar tissue growth. To be able to compare the test group and control group, researchers need a model of quantification of the total amount of scar tissue based on MRI.

Multi-center radiological studies commonly include several centers from different parts of the world, so that a wide database of patients could be created. Images are sent to the headquarters from where they are forwarded to the radiologist via a server. This model allows data collection for a large number of patients with specific pathology, which is typically not the case when data collection is restricted to work in one hospital.

Since multi-centered studies rely on databases and images from different clinical centers around the world, images sent to radiologists often come in different formats. For instance, though DICOM is a standardized format used in radiology nowadays, multi-center studies often employ a great number of inadequate and uncalibrated images with no calibration scale or formats, which cannot be uploaded into the existing PACS. Sometimes, images are saved in a format which can only be opened by a particular viewer which does not have a needed calibration option or measurement tool. In such situations, the viewer only allows viewing the image or printing to film.

### Postoperative adhesions in gynecologic surgery: a committee opinion [^111Dg91z]. Fertility and Sterility (2019). High credibility.

Surgical technique — frequency and determinants of postoperative adhesions: Formation of postoperative adhesions often may be minimized by careful surgical technique with adherence to microsurgical principles, including gentle tissue handling, meticulous hemostasis, excision of necrotic tissue, minimization of ischemia and desiccation, use of fine nonreactive suture materials, and prevention of foreign-body reaction and infection. The larger the residual amount of blood and serosanguinous fluid, the more frequently adhesions can occur. Postoperative adhesions have been observed in up to 94% of patients after laparotomy. Laparoscopy does not necessarily result in fewer adhesions than laparotomy; the extent of tissue injury, not the surgical approach, is the determining factor, and risk for the development of de novo anterior abdominal wall adhesions is likely lower after laparoscopy than after laparotomy because the risk relates to the length of the abdominal incision(s).

### Outcome impact of individualized fluid management during spine surgery: a before-after prospective comparison study [^113E4Dpa]. BMC Anesthesiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, total intraoperative fluid volumes were not significantly different between the Control and the IFM group. At first sight, it may appear somewhat surprising to observe differences in postoperative outcome without observing differences in the volume of fluid administered during surgery. Actually, this finding is consistent with the results of recent multicenter studies and meta-analyses. Indeed, it has been hypothesized that the individualization of fluid therapy is effective through timely replenishment of fluid for patients who are fluid responders and avoidance of fluid overload for those who are not. With the guidance of IFM protocol, fluid responders are more likely to receive more fluid and non-responders more likely to receive less. This may explain why the average volume of fluid was comparable between groups.

The decrease in postoperative complications was not associated with a significant decrease in hospital length of stay. Several reasons could explain this finding. First, the implementation of IFM was associated with a significant decrease in minor complications, which are less likely to impact length of stay than major complications. Second, hospital discharge depends not only on postoperative complications but also on cultural and logistic factors such as the agreement from the patient or their family, as well as the availability of a structure for re-education. In this respect, several IFM studies have reported a significant decrease in postoperative complications that was not associated with a significant reduction in hospital length of stay.

### A prospective, randomized, multicenter trial assessing a novel lysine-derived urethane adhesive in a large flap surgical procedure without drains [^111FsfWv]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Most previous studies evaluating methods for reducing fluid-related complications have focused on the volume of fluid output from the drains, or on the time to drain removal. Neither of these measures has been shown to have clinical significance in terms of the recovery time of the patient or in their long-term risk of developing an intractable seroma requiring further medical attention. The current study took a different approach by evaluating the number of invasive procedures, which allowed a comparison across groups that directly addresses the frequency of clinical intervention and patient management during the recovery process. This approach also recognizes the fact that having an indwelling drain itself is an invasive procedure, and that drain removal can be perceived by patients to be equally if not more invasive than needle aspiration. This is a highly relevant point, since a seroma cannot be diagnosed in the presence of a drain, and a scoring system must be used that accounts for the presence of a drain to manage post-operative fluid and provides a fair comparison with a needle aspiration. As needle aspiration is a single, low-risk event, we considered a drain removal to be a similar single, low-risk event. A weakness of that measure is that drains present for a longer period time are scored as a single event when removed, despite more days of continuous discomfort for the patient and higher risk of infection. Indeed, a scoring system that accounts for discomfort and inconvenience due to drain maintenance would be useful but more difficult to validate and compare with singular self-limited procedures such as needle aspiration.

### Seromadesis following total hip resurfacing by aspiration and injection of doxycycline [^112ngot6]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

Discussion

A seroma is a pocket of clear serous fluid that forms within the body after surgery. A surgically or traumatically created dead space leads to the accumulation of lymph, inflammatory and exudative fluid which prevents tissue adhesion. The fluid is composed of blood plasma from leaky vessels, disrupted lymphatic channels and the exudative inflammatory fluid produced from damaged cells. Seromas remain a trepid and difficult surgical complication. Different treatment options include external compression, percutaneous aspiration and additional surgical interventions with varied success. In this case, there may have been an additional inflammatory exudate due to fine element wear debris produced from the metal-on-metal hip resurfacing implant. This may have been exacerbated by an early, rapid progression to intense physical activity during the postoperative period. Seromas remain a trepid and difficult surgical complication. Current treatment options include compression, percutaneous aspiration and possible additional surgical interventions. Accessing the sterile fluid within the cavity poses a risk for contaminating the seroma with commensal organisms resulting in infection. The use of sclerotherapy in the management of seromas has been reported in small scale studies and case reports, and has shown strong success with minimal complications. In this case, the initial aspiration and washout of the early postoperative haematoma collection did not succeed in preventing the seroma formation. Furthermore, the open washout and repeat aspiration, though negative for organisms on tissue culture, led to the formation of a small sinus and an infected seroma. This ultimately required two-stage revision surgery given the likely communication with the hip resurfacing implant. Despite excision of the pseudo-capsule that had formed during the second stage revision total hip replacement, the seroma recollected.

### Left behind: unintentionally retained surgically placed foreign bodies and how to reduce their incidence – pictorial review [^1115J2nn]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

Unintentionally retained surgically placed foreign bodies have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality, as well as increased costs and medicolegal consequences. This article reviews some of the most commonly retained surgical devices and provides a structured approach to intraoperative image acquisition and interpretation. By increasing the awareness of surgically placed foreign bodies, our goal is to reduce the incidence of and the complications associated with this difficult clinical problem.

Conclusion

Despite various systems and safeguards available, unintentionally retained surgically placed foreign bodies remain difficult to eliminate completely. Developing a standardized approach to the request, "intraoperative film, rule out foreign body", is essential to reduce the adverse outcomes associated with this problem.

### Retained surgical items and minimally invasive surgery [^114dcvep]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

The second way in which a retained sponge can present is months to years after the initial operation and the sponge often presents as a mass. These sponges have induced a fibrous reaction, much like a grain of sand in an oyster, and the body has walled off the sponge. These masses have been worked up as a suspicious neoplasm and CT and MRI scans have been instrumental in establishing the correct diagnosis. In these cases, the retained sponge was removed successfully with an MIS approach. There is an extensive literature on the successful use of laparoscopic and thoracoscopic approaches for the retrieval of post-traumatic and self-induced retained foreign bodies. Within these series there have been reports of retrieval of small miscellaneous surgical items such as a ureteral stent and drain fragments. Experience with the removal of these foreign bodies can be applied to the decision on how to approach a retained surgical item. It is not unreasonable to attempt an MIS approach if the necessary expertise is available.

Technological adjuncts for sponge counts

There are three commercial systems currently available worldwide as adjuncts to a manual sponge count. All three are in use in hospitals throughout the US. The systems are not interchangeable and once a hospital commits to one system, all the sponges used in that facility are switched to the specific new technology sponge management system. There is not much data on the success of implementation of these systems, and more importantly on the failures of these systems, but as experience is gained more reports will be forthcoming. All three use different and distinct technological approaches and have different applications in MIS cases. The essential components of each device are a distinct type of detection element attached to a surgical sponge (Fig. 1) and a distinct compatible electronic readout system. The devices can be separated into one that can count sponges, one that can detect sponges, and one that can count and detect sponges.

### Massive weight loss without surgery in a super obese patient [^111Fc8Z4]. Obesity Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Large weight losses are rarely achieved through non-surgical procedures, but are also possible without professional help. A massive weight loss may be complicated by the development of an eating disorder psychopathology, followed by weight regain. We report the case of a male patient with super obesity (BMI, 86.2 kg/m(2)), who achieved a massive weight loss (170 kg in 2 years) largely without professional help and without surgery. The final body weight (∼ 100 kg; BMI, 32.6) has now been maintained for nearly 2 years. After weight loss, the patient had massive skin redundancy in several areas including the breasts, arms, abdomen, back, and thighs and a true body weight probably in the normal range. All laboratory tests were normal, with the exception of low free testosterone. Sonographic examination showed gall bladder microlithiasis. No eating disorders and other axis I and axis II psychiatric disorders were present. The case illustrates how much weight loss and weight-loss maintenance can be exceptionally achieved without surgery and without developing an eating disorder of clinical severity or other psychiatric disorders.

### Retained intrathecal catheter fragment after spinal drain insertion [^111ZNBH6]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Background and Objectives

The placement of lumbar spinal drains is being done with increasing frequency to facilitate high-risk surgical procedures. One risk associated with these procedures is catheter shearing, resulting in a retained foreign body in the intrathecal space. Unlike retained epidural fragments, there are no guidelines on the management of this complication. The purpose of this article was to synthesize the literature on this subject to come up with guidelines for preventing and managing this complication.

Methods

Case report and review of all published cases.

Results

Most cases of retained catheters are associated with difficulty inserting or advancing the catheter. Among those cases treated conservatively, approximately one third of patients developed symptoms. Factors that must be considered when weighing the decision to surgically remove the retained catheter include patient comorbidities and desires, size and location of the fragment, infectious risk, the presence of neurologic symptoms, and scheduled surgical procedure.

Conclusions

A retained intrathecal catheter can be managed conservatively in certain contexts. Periodic follow-up visits, with or without repeat imaging, are recommended in these circumstances.

### Glyburide and metformin [^115QyUjL]. FDA (2011). Low credibility.

It's also important for your liver to be working normally when you take glyburide and metformin. Your liver helps remove lactic acid from your bloodstream.

Your doctor will monitor your diabetes and may perform blood tests on you from time to time to make sure your kidneys and your liver are functioning normally.

There is no evidence that glyburide and metformin causes harm to the kidneys or liver.

11. Are there other risk factors for lactic acidosis?

Your risk of developing lactic acidosis from taking glyburide and metformin is very low as long as your kidneys and liver are healthy. However, some factors can increase your risk because they can affect kidney and liver function. You should discuss your risk with your physician.

You should not take glyburide and metformin if:

You have chronic kidney or liver problems
You have congestive heart failure which is treated with medications, e.g., digoxin (Lanoxin®) or furosemide (Lasix®)
You drink alcohol excessively (all the time or short-term "binge" drinking)
You are seriously dehydrated (have lost a large amount of body fluids)
You are going to have certain x-ray procedures with injectable contrast agents
You are going to have surgery
You develop a serious condition such as a heart attack, severe infection, or a stroke
You are ≥ 80 years of age and have NOT had your kidney function tested

### Edema: diagnosis and management… [^117DKd7J]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility. Acute swelling of a limb over a period of less than 72 hours is more characteristic of deep venous thrombosis, cellulitis, ruptured popliteal cyst, acute compartment syndrome from trauma, or recent initiation of calcium channel blockers. The chronic accumulation of more generalized edema is due to the onset or exacerbation of chronic systemic conditions, such as congestive heart failure, renal disease, or hepatic disease. 4, 5. Pitting describes an indentation that remains in the edematous area after pressure is applied. This occurs when fluid in the interstitial space has a low concentration of protein, which is associated with decreased plasma oncotic pressure and disorders caused by increased capillary pressure. 4, 16 The physician should describe the location, timing, and extent of the pitting to determine treatment response.

OTHER STUDIES Echocardiography to evaluate pulmonary arterial pressures is recommended for patients with obstructive sleep apnea and edema. CHRONIC VENOUS INSUFFICIENCY In patients with chronic venous insufficiency, diuretic therapy should be avoided unless a comorbid condition requires it. Mechanical therapies, including leg elevation and compression stockings with 20 to 30 mm Hg for mild edema and 30 to 40 mm Hg for severe edema complicated by ulceration, are recommended. LYMPHEDEMA The mainstay of lymphedema treatment involves complex decongestive physiotherapy, which is composed of manual lymphatic massage and multilayer bandages. The initial goal is to improve fluid resorption until a maximum therapeutic response is reached. The maintenance phase of treatment includes compression stockings at 30 to 40 mm Hg. 11, 37, 38 Pneumatic compression devices have been shown to augment standard therapies.

One randomized controlled trial of women with breast cancer–related lymphedema showed statistically significant improvement in lymphatic function following one hour of pneumatic compression therapy. 39 In a study of 155 patients with cancer- and non–cancer-related lymphedema, 95% of patients noted reduction in limb edema after using pneumatic compression devices at home. 40 Surgical debulking or bypass procedures are limited to severe refractory cases. 7 Diuretics do not have a role in the treatment of lymphedema.

### Meta-analysis of negative-pressure wound therapy for closed surgical incisions [^115zPTc7]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The three studies 34, 38, 39 that reported on seroma formation were performed by the same research team, rendering the study designs comparable. Owing to some risk of bias within the studies, and because all three studies had a small sample size (19–21 patients), the quality of evidence was downgraded to moderate. The pooled results showed a convincing effect of iNPWT on seroma formation. The NNT to avoid one seroma (3, 95 per cent c.i. 2 to 8) suggested that iNPWT might be cost‐effective with respect to reducing the risk of seroma formation within the first 10 days after surgery. However, with a mean reduction of 1.97 mL (day 5) and 1.44 mL (day 10), the clinical relevance is questionable. A larger effect was found in an animal study 21 focusing on the effect of iNPWT treatment on lymph clearance. The authors found that 4 days of treatment reduced the quantity of haematoma/seroma by a mean(s.e.m.) of 25(8) g in iNPWT sites compared with control sites. All three studies included in this review had a hospital‐based follow‐up of 10 days, which could be a weakness. Seroma volume and the duration of seroma production depend on many factors, including anatomical site, surgical procedure and the size of the defect. Many seromas might have decreased by day 10, but the total seroma production and a possible effect of iNPWT on this is difficult to assess when the patients have not been followed to the end of fluid production. Accordingly, longer follow‐up would be preferable.

### Improving the recording of surgical drain output [^111ZA5kN]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

Background

The output from surgical drains often guides management as drains are commonly not removed until the wound bed drains < 50 mls a day. Failure to have a clear 24 hour output often results in drains that could be safely removed staying in-situ for a further day, increasing the risk of unnecessary pain and infection.

Output of surgical drains should be monitored for procedural complications such as bleeding and as such, the type and location of drains needs to be quickly and accurately established. The minimum daily data set to be documented from each drain should therefore be the location and type of each drain, its 24 hour output, and the nature of the fluid draining, ie serous, serosanguinous, or seroprulent.

Also of note is that the fluid in the drain in the immediate post-operative period is usually wash or blood from the procedure and is not produced by the wound. Unless documented in recovery, this fluid will be added to the first days total and delay drain removal and risk further complications.

### A prospective, randomized, multicenter trial assessing a novel lysine-derived urethane adhesive in a large flap surgical procedure without drains [^116nV8g3]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Current approaches to reduce seroma risk have focused on eliminating fluid from the wound during the days after surgery. For decades, closed suction drainage has been considered the standard of care for the prevention of fluid-related complications. Surgical drains typically remain in place for a week or more until the volume of fluid collected drops below a specific level. This amount is generally established as less than 30 mL of fluid measured in a 24-h period. Comparing five studies in which the mean time to last drain removal after abdominoplasty was measured, the average time to last drain removal per subject was 6.9 days.

Although well accepted as the standard of care, the use of closed suction drains is not without risks. The use of drains is associated with a significant increase both in post-operative pain and hospital stay, as well as complications including retrograde bacterial migration and infection. Perhaps the most serious of these is the increased risk of surgical site infections (SSIs) that is associated with drain use. In a study of breast biopsy patients, the use of post-operative drains was one of the risk factors most highly associated with SSIs, and 26% of the patients developing SSIs required re-hospitalization for treatment. Studies indicate a correlation between the length of time the drain remains in place and the likelihood of developing a SSI. For example, in a retrospective study of breast surgeries, drains remaining in place for 5–15 days increased the odds ratio of developing a SSI to 1.84 compared to patients with no drains, with a further increase to an odds ratio of 2.14 for drains in longer than 16 days.

### Secondary breast augmentation: managing each case [^1133a6UR]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Changes in Breast Volume Caused by the Presence of Liquid

A change in breast volume can be caused by a hematoma or seroma. If the change occurs immediately, within 7 days of surgery, it generally is due to a hematoma and will manifest as pain, hardening of the breast that does not diminish in a few days, and an increase in volume. If the change in volume is immediate and large, drainage should be performed within the first 24 h. Treatment with anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, and ultrasound should be administered within a week to stimulate reabsorption.

Although rare, delayed hematoma can appear after weeks, months, or even years. It may be due to secondary bleeding or microfractures in the capsule induced by microtrauma, microinflammation, or an increase in capillary permeability. The capsule formed around the implant serves as a barrier that can limit the hematoma, thus preventing contamination. A delayed hematoma should be evacuated as soon as it is diagnosed. This evacuation may coincide with a closed capsulectomy.

If the increase in volume occurs months or years later (Fig. 15 a and b), it almost always is the result of a seroma. Such a volume increase is soft to the touch, which distinguishes it from a hematoma, which is hard. The treatment should include antiinflammatory drugs, diuretics, initial observation, and suction drainage (Fig. 16). The differential diagnosis between hematoma and seroma should be performed with an MRI when the clinical diagnosis is not sufficient.

### Hypovolemia with peripheral edema: what is wrong? [^114stfj4]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Macroscopic studies

The described microcirculatory and molecular events may be interpreted when having macroscopic analyses in mind. During the past decade, volume kinetic studies have quantified the entrance of isotonic electrolyte fluid to the slowly equilibrating interstitial pool by using the rate constant k b. In conscious volunteers this parameter attains a value being 10% of rate of entrance to the fast fluid pool, and approximately 25% of the urine flow rate. During general anesthesia k b becomes approximately 50% larger, and the flow may even exceed the urinary excretion (Fig. 5).

The volume kinetic model used the distinguish between two interstitial fluid pools. Hypovolemia might develop if distribution to the infused fluid to the interstitial pools is prominent

Pooling of many experiments suggests that fluid leaves the slowly equilibrating fluid pool and returns to the plasma with a half-time of approximately 2 h while the half-time is close to 10 min for the rapidly equilibrating pool (N = 233, unpublished). The lymphatic circuit operates like a "telephone line" and return flow of fluid to the plasma increases within minutes in response to intravenous fluid loading.

The half-time for the persistence of fluid in the slow interstitial pool is much longer in inflammatory states. For example, re-analysis of a cohort of patients undergoing surgery for cholecystitis or appendicitis even yielded a negative return flow rate for the slowly equilibrating fluid phase. This result agrees with the bewildering circumstance in burns that a fluid infusion further lowers P if).

Li et al. induced sepsis in 25 anesthetized sheep by injecting lipopolysaccharide and puncturing the cecum. One hour later, they studied the volume kinetics of 20 mL/kg of Ringer´s lactate infused over 30 min. Overall, there was virtually no urinary excretion and extremely small or negative flow rates of fluid distribution from the interstitium to the plasma. Refined analysis again showed that the rate constant for the return flow from the slowly equilibrating fluid pool attained a negative value, which suggests a suction effect. This expansion occurred at the expense of the rapidly equilibrating fluid phase, which now amounted to only 1/3 of the plasma volume. These experiments were designed to distinguish the influence of four catecholamines on the distribution of infused Ringer´s, but only dopamine showed a slight ability to "normalize" the clearly pathological fluid distribution.

### Is breast seroma after tumour resection associated with patient-reported breast appearance change following radiotherapy? Results from the IMPORT HIGH (CRUK / 06 / 003) trial [^1162x8Rh]. Radiotherapy and Oncology (2019). Medium credibility.

Seroma formation describes the collection of serous fluid within a cavity and has been reported following breast surgery. Seroma prevalence of 37% and 57% was reported in the Cambridge IMRTand FASTtrials respectively. Seroma has been associated with increased rates of post-operative infection and haematoma, and is an independent risk factor for normal tissue effects (NTE) following radiotherapy.

An association between seroma and NTE has been reported in the RAPIDand Cambridge IMRT trials. The mechanisms by which seroma may lead to NTE following radiotherapy are unknown. As well as fibrosis and retraction of the seroma cavity being possible contributing factors, seroma leading to larger volumes receiving radiotherapy boost doses should also be considered. In the EORTC 'boost versus no boost' trial there was an increased risk of fibrosis in those patients receiving a boostand this risk was further increased in patients with a seroma. However, this was significant on univariate analysis only.

The majority of these trials used clinician assessments of NTE and/or serial photographs. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) provide an opportunity to understand the patients' own perception of NTE and studies have found that patients report more NTE compared with clinicians and those detected on photographs. However, the association between the presence of seroma and patient-reported NTE following breast radiotherapy has not been investigated to date.

This analysis from IMPORT HIGH uniquely combines comprehensive PROMs' data with presence/absence of seroma whilst accounting for other patient, tumour and treatment factors. The primary aim of this study was to determine whether seroma is associated with patient-reported breast appearance change following breast radiotherapy. The secondary aim was to investigate associations between other patient/tumour/treatment factors and patient-reported breast appearance change.

### Pleural fluid characteristics of patients with symptomatic pleural effusion after coronary artery bypass graft surgery… [^116rV8r7]. JAMA Network (2000). Excellent credibility.

Most effusions are small, asymptomatic, and left sided; regress spontaneously; and are of no clinical significance. Occasionally a patient may develop a moderate to large symptomatic pleural effusion after CABG. Most effusions are diagnosed in the early postoperative course; however, some attain their maximal size weeks to months after surgery. The pathogenesis of the post-CABG effusion remains obscure, and the pleural fluid characteristics have not been described. The purpose of the present study was to describe the pleural fluid findings in patients who develop symptomatic pleural effusions after CABG.

The medical records of the 113 patients who had undergone CABG were further reviewed and data were collected regarding age and sex, type of surgery, side and size of effusion, timing of occurrence of effusion after CABG, characteristics of the pleural fluid as listed below, list of medical problems, medication list, and left ventricular ejection fraction by echocardiography or left ventriculography. Occasionally a patient may develop a moderate to large symptomatic pleural effusion after CABG. The prevalence of large effusions after CABG is not definitely known but has been reported3, 5, 6 to be 1% to 4%. Most effusions occur in the early postoperative period; however, some effusions reach their maximum size only months after CABG. These differences in the pleural fluid findings of the 2 groups may provide clues as to the etiology of the effusions.

The pathogenesis of early effusions is probably related to trauma during surgery that results in bleeding into the pleural space. The high RBC count, indicating a median hematocrit of 0. 20, provides strong evidence for the traumatic origin. Our study has several clinical implications. First, large effusions related to CABG can present in the late period. These effusions contain a high percentage of lymphocytes and resemble other lymphocytic exudates, such as those due to tuberculosis, malignancy, lymphoma, and other chronic infections. 12 One factor that is different with post-CABG effusions is that the LDH level is relatively low.

### Failed back surgery syndrome: review and new hypotheses [^116RXVqV]. Journal of Pain Research (2016). Low credibility.

Risk factors

Literature identifies the possible risk factors leading to such chronic syndrome, divided into pre- and postintervention risk, and risks occurring during the surgical procedure. The patient may present with spinal instability prior to surgery, or in proceeding to surgery, there may be anomalies shown in the clinical images without good clinical correlation. There is a nonexhaustive relationship between the surgeon and the patient's response to surgery. Another preintervention risk factor is linked to the cause that leads to disease or spinal radiculopathy arising from metabolic problems (diabetes), vascular, viral, previous trauma, and tumors. It is acknowledged that psychosocial factors also have an effect on the presence of FBSS. Patients who demonstrate a psychologically altered state, such as depression, anxiety, somatization, and hypochondria, are more prone to unsatisfactory surgical outcomes.

Risk factors during the surgical procedure that would affect response rate of FBSS are especially related to surgeon error, such as an incorrect vertebral localization of the problem or a partially completed operation (eg, an inadequate decompression). The surgical procedure itself (vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty) could create vertebral fractures, independent from intervention of the surgeon.

Oversights by the surgeon, such as an aggressive decompression could lead to spinal instability, or a nonperfect positioning of the means of synthesis, and an erroneous clinical decision of the requirement for surgery.–The unfavorable factors on encountering FBSS after surgery are manifold, such as postoperative complications in the presence of hematomas or infections. The presence of pseudarthrosis after surgical fusion and encountering epidural fibrosis alter the function and nutrition to the root of nerve.,

Anatomic and biomechanical intervention-related alterations may lead to instability of the spine, sacroiliac dysfunction, and foraminal compressions or overburden an area of the vertebra or other vertebral areas and predispose the patient to further spinal pathology, similar to those that led the patient to have surgery.–

Another postoperative factor is changes in the myofascial system connected to the vertebral area of the surgery, in particular to the paraspinal muscles in spasm or hypotrophy, which can cause referred pain that is difficult to distinguish from real spinal radiculopathy. The same biomechanical alterations lead to proprioceptive disturbances of other muscles, like the multifidus, lumbar rotators and the transverse abdominis, which, similar to a vicious circle, will cause pain in the lumbar region. Currently, there is no "Gold" standard in the cure and treatment of FBSS.

### Breast cancer: prevention of… [^111AsfkR]. NCI (2008). Low credibility.

3] Similarly, a randomized intervention study in women with breast cancer demonstrated, by limb volume measurements or physician diagnosis, that 42% of subjects had lymphedema at 18 months after surgery. Normally, the dynamics favor a net gain of interstitial fluid, with the excess removed via lymphatic channels. Because lymphatic vessels often lack a basement membrane, they can resorb molecules too large for venous uptake as well. In short, the lymphatic system controls the pressure, volume, and composition of the interstitial fluid. Lymphatic obstruction leads to increased interstitial fluid, which often contains large proteins and cellular debris. Through mechanisms not fully understood, the increased interstitial fluid induces inflammation, destruction or sclerosis of the lymphatic vessels, fibrosis, and, ultimately, adipose tissue hypertrophy.

Serial limb volume measurements were obtained from a cohort of women who underwent a lymph node dissection for vulvar, endometrial, or cervical cancer 4 to 6 weeks after surgery and then every 3 months. The incidence of an increase in limb volume of more than 10% was 43% for vulvar cancer, 34% for endometrial cancer, and 33% for cervical cancer. In another smaller, single-institution, retrospective study of 66 patients who underwent therapeutic nodal dissection, the rate of permanent lymphedema for inguinal node dissection was 38%, compared with 12% for axillary node dissection. Another potentially relevant variable is the type of dissection. A 2017 systematic review did not find an appreciable difference between the rate of lymphedema after therapeutic lymphadenectomy and completion of lymph node sampling after a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy. In both instances, the rate was around 20%.

The water displacement method is another way to evaluate arm edema. A volume difference of 200 mL or more between the affected and opposite arms is typically considered to be a cutoff point to define lymphedema.
- **Grade 3**: More than 30% interlimb discrepancy in volume; lymphorrhea; gross deviation from normal anatomical contour; interference with activities of daily living.
- **Grade 4**: Progression to malignancy; amputation indicated; disabling lymphedema.

### The intravascular volume effect of Ringer's lactate is below 20%: a prospective study in humans [^115ScVr7]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

Showing an intravascular volume effect for Ringer's lactate of 17 ± 10% while replacing an acute blood loss, the present data coincide not only with physiological considerations, but also with clinical observations. It is interesting to physiologists, but startling to clinicians that the significant intravascular hypovolemia resulting from our abortive attempt of normovolemic hemodilution with crystalloid was not reflected by any clinically relevant hemodynamical changes or vasopressor requirements. This, however, confirms very recent functional observations in patients before elective surgery and might be an explanation of what was observed in a highly cited large prospective clinical trial on a mixed collective of 6,997 ICU patients. The study compared resuscitation with isotonic saline vs. an isooncotic human albumin preparation under routine monitoring conditions. The patients of the crystalloid group received in total only the 1.4-fold amount of those stabilized with protein solutions. The interpretation to have evidence of a similar volume effect between these two different classes of preparations under intensive care conditions might be, on the one hand, quite justified, as critical illness might significantly contribute to a breakdown of the vascular barrier. On the other hand, however, the clinical impression of cardiocirculatory stability might be put into an interesting new perspective by the present data, despite being derived from a completely different collective under highly standardized conditions: Obviously, at least cardiopulmonary-compensated patients receiving crystalloids to stabilize cardiac preload in the face of acute bleeding are endangered to sustain undetected intravascular hypovolemia under routine monitoring. Such an occult deficit might be of relevance to a patient. It has been reported that compensatory vasoconstriction might negatively influence local tissue perfusion. Already a blood loss of 10% has been demonstrated to relevantly compromise splanchnic perfusion. In our study, the mean decrease in blood volume by 11.6% was most likely accompanied by an impressive interstitial edema of more than two liters. This is not only a short-term effect, but can be relatively lasting and, in addition, negatively influences microcirculation and tissue oxygen tension. Even in healthy volunteers, the kidneys need more than two days to excrete this fluid overload. Postoperative weight gain after fluid overload has been shown to be associated with an increased perioperative mortality. Our applied study protocol most likely created an undesirable patient condition prior to major abdominal surgery.

### Strategies for postoperative seroma prevention: a systematic review [^111LLyyS]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There is conflicting evidence on the effectiveness of the various strategies to prevent postoperative seroma. Many high-quality studies have been performed to evaluate those strategies, but the numbers of patients included in those studies have been small. The authors' goal was to perform a systematic review of all Level I and II studies on the prevention of postoperative seroma.

Methods

A PubMed search was performed of all Level I and II studies that evaluated strategies for the prevention of postoperative seroma. Only English-language comparative studies on humans, defining seroma as a postoperative serous fluid collection detectable on physical examination, were included. Data from all the studies were compiled, and a systematic review was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of each strategy.

Results

Seventy-five studies comprising 7173 patients were included. Effective strategies for seroma prevention included the use of closed-suction drains; keeping the drains until their output volume was minimal; maintaining a high pressure gradient in the drains; using sharp or ultrasonic dissection rather than cautery; dissecting the abdomen in a place superficial to the Scarpa fascia; ligating blood vessels with sutures or clips; using quilting or progressive tension sutures; using fibrin, thrombin, or talc; and immobilizing the surgical site postoperatively. Surgical-site compression did not prevent seroma accumulation. The use of sclerosants at the initial operation actually increased the risk of seroma.

Conclusions

Seroma is a common and frustrating complication in plastic surgery. This study demonstrates that simple strategies can be used to lower the risk of seroma.

### A slow-exchange interstitial fluid compartment in volunteers and anesthetized patients: kinetic analysis and physiology [^115ZEwhi]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Physiological studies suggest that the interstitial space contains 2 fluid compartments, but no analysis has been performed to quantify their sizes and turnover rates.

Methods

Retrospective data were retrieved from 270 experiments where Ringer's solution of between 238 and 2750 mL (mean, 1487 mL) had been administered by intravenous infusion to awake and anesthetized humans (mean age 39 years, 47% females). Urinary excretion and hemoglobin-derived plasma dilution served as input variables in a volume kinetic analysis using mixed-models software.

Results

The kinetic analysis successfully separated 2 interstitial fluid compartments. One equilibrated rapidly with the plasma and the other equilibrated slowly. General anesthesia doubled the rate constants for fluid entering these 2 compartments (from 0.072 to 0.155 and from 0.026 to 0.080 min -1, respectively). The return flows to the plasma were impeded by intensive fluid therapy; the rate constant for the fast-exchange compartment decreased from 0.251 to 0.050 when the infusion time increased from 15 to 60 minutes, and the rate constant for the slow-exchange compartment decreased from 0.019 to 0.005 when the infused volume increased from 500 to 1500 mL. The slow-exchange compartment became disproportionately expanded when larger fluid volumes were infused and even attained an unphysiologically large size when general anesthesia was added, suggesting that the flow of fluid was restrained and not solely determined by hydrostatic and oncotic forces. The dependence of the slow-exchange compartment on general anesthesia, crystalloid infusion rate, and infusion volume all suggest a causal physiological process.

Conclusions

Kinetic analysis supported that Ringer's solution distributes in 2 interstitial compartments with different turnover times. The slow compartment became dominant when large amounts of fluid were infused and during general anesthesia. These findings may explain why fluid accumulates in peripheral tissues during surgery and why infused fluid can remain in the body for several days after general anesthesia.

### Diatrizoate meglumine (Hypaque sodium) [^1147WbYy]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

Indications

Cervical discography is a more hazardous procedure than lumbar discography, and the interpretation of the cervical discograms is more difficult.

The injected medium gradually diffuses throughout the disc and is absorbed rapidly. In a normal disc, good contrast is evident for 10 to 15 minutes. In a ruptured disc, the medium is absorbed more rapidly. Aspiration of the medium on completion of discography is considered unnecessary.

Contraindication

Discography is contraindicated when there is infection or open injury near the region to be examined.

Warning

Inadvertent subarachnoid injection must be avoided since even the small dose of the medium used in discography might result in convulsions and death. The onset of signs of pain, cramps, or convulsions (requiring anesthesia) may occur within minutes to an hour.

Precautions

A strict, aseptic technique is required to avoid introducing infection. The examination should be postponed if local or systemic infection is present. In cervical discography, care should be taken to avoid contamination of the disc by inadvertent puncture of the esophagus. Laceration of the disc by use of a needle that has become barbed by forceful impingement on a vertebra, should be avoided. The patient should be cautioned not to move during introduction of the needle.

Adverse Reactions

In the normal disc, only minor discomfort will occur during injection. More discomfort will result if excessive pressure or volume is used. Pain is unusual and may indicate extravasation.

In the damaged disc, however, the injection can cause pain, sometimes severe, which mimics the symptoms. Transient backache or headache, as in lumbar puncture, often occurs. Extravasation from the disc into the lateral recesses and extradurally into the spinal canal or local soft tissue does not usually cause adverse effects.

During discography extreme care is advised to avoid inadvertent intrathecal injection since the injection of even small amounts of the contrast medium may cause convulsions, permanent sequelae, or fatality. Should the accident occur, the patient should be placed upright to confine the hyperbaric solution to a low level, anesthesia may be required to control convulsions, and if there is evidence of a large dose having been administered, a careful cerebrospinal fluid exchange-washout should be considered.

### Lumbar cerebrospinal fluid drainage for thoracoabdominal aortic surgery: rationale and practical considerations for management [^114WNEic]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2010). Low credibility.

Paraplegia remains one of the most devastating complications of thoracoabdominal aortic surgery and is associated with a significant increase in both morbidity and mortality. Modern aortic repair techniques use many modalities aimed at reducing the risk of spinal cord ischemia inherent with surgical management. One of these modalities that acts via optimizing spinal cord blood flow is lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage. Either alone or in combination with other interventions, CSF drainage remains one of the most frequently used spinal cord protection techniques. Despite no definitive proof of efficacy for reducing spinal cord injury, there are compelling data supporting its use. However, the potential benefit of CSF drainage must be balanced against the risks associated with its use, including nerve injury during insertion, compressive neuraxial hematoma formation, intracranial hemorrhage due to excessive drainage, and infection. The optimal benefit to risk ratio can be achieved by understanding the rationale for its use and following practical management guidelines.

### Quantitative analysis of fluid balance during abdominal surgery [^113uiNQY]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Surgical injury causes acute sequestration of interstitial fluid in injured tissue. Fluid sequestration treated with IV fluid administration can lead to postoperative complications related to excessive intravascular volume. Quantitative prediction of interstitial fluid sequestration may foster a better understanding of the relationship between fluid administered and the resulting balance between intra- and extravascular fluid.

Methods

We developed a mathematical model describing the dynamic distribution and transport of fluid and proteins with the goal of quantifying the balance of fluid between intra- and extravascular compartments. Fluid volume changes in the plasma, interstitial and urine compartments were calculated for a simulated 4 h abdominal surgery in a 70 kg male. To validate the model, we compared the results obtained with those measured by segmental bioelectrical impedance on 30 patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery.

Results

The model predicted that, compared to the normal state, surgical injury would result in the sequestration of 705 mL of interstitial fluid in injured tissue, whereas plasma volume would undergo a 356 mL decrease. During surgery, it was not possible to obtain a normal plasma volume, even with fluid replacement at a rate of almost 20 mL x kg(-1) x h(-1). Bias and limit of agreement on interstitial fluid volume changes in body segments between bioelectrical impedance and model prediction were -131 and 325 mL, respectively for limbs, and -157 and 834 mL for the trunk.

Conclusions

The model shows that increasing the fluid replacement rate above 10 mL x kg(-1) x h(-1) does not have the desired effect on plasma volume but instead increases the interstitial volume.

### Retained surgical items and minimally invasive surgery [^116y3H7h]. World Journal of Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Fig. 3

To complete the discussion, mention needs to be made of surgical needles of various sizes that are used routinely during MIS cases and can be dropped or lost. Small needles (< 15 mm) can be difficult to find and have not been reported to cause injury in large body cavities. Larger lost or broken needles have been reported to cause pain and psychological discomfort and various methods have been explored to aid in their identification and removal.

Instruments are usually counted before the operation begins using the standardized count sheets sent with the instrument trays. Frequently, multiple instruments are opened during surgery and counting and tracking them all is time consuming and probably error prone, so hospitals have developed exceptions to the general requirement of counting all instruments. Exceptions have been made based on the size of the instrument in relation to the wound or the size of the patient. These exceptions have often excluded the counting of MIS instruments that are too large to be left in the wound and would be removed from the field if the case progressed to open. Final counts of sponges, needles, instruments, and small miscellaneous items should be documented separately in the operative record since a case can have an incorrect needle final count (missing a small needle) but correct counts for the other classes of items. Sponges, needles, and small miscellaneous objects can be retained inside the patient and their chance of retention is not based upon the size of the wound; thus, they should be accounted for in all cases.

### Prediction of fluid challenge effect: filling pressure when left ventricular function is abnormal, diastolic volume when left ventricular function is normal [^114L59hg]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Fluid resuscitation is a cornerstone of intensive care unit patient care, but prediction of the cardiovascular response remains difficult, despite many efforts in clinical research. The concept of responders and nonresponders illustrates such a difficulty. Many techniques have been tested, from strictly non-invasive to invasive, delivering various parameters related to the fluid challenge response. Considering the physical parameters available, such as pressure, volume and flow generated by right and left pumps circulating in elastic or compliant tubes, it sounds useful to go back to the basic knowledge to discuss the results of the present article. This published study tested in the postoperative period of cardiovascular surgery the prediction obtained with filling pressures and the diastolic volume. When left ventricular function (global ejection fraction) is adequate, the volume before fluid administration seems to predict well the fluid challenge response; whereas when the global ejection fraction is poor, the filling pressure seems more suitable. The present commentary discusses the main physiological issues related to these findings, with some methodological aspects.

### We should avoid the term "fluid overload" [^115MKcBB]. Critical Care (2018). Low credibility.

Using the right word or phrase to describe a specific pathologic process/patient diagnosis and/or status is important, not only within the intensive care unit team, but also when we communicate with external consultants. This is not just a question of semantics. Using incorrect terms can lead to misunderstanding and even to incorrect therapeutic decisions. For example, it is not uncommon to see clinicians examining an edematous patient, saying that the patient has "fluid overload" or "hypervolemia" or both and proposing fluid restriction and/or diuretics as the logical strategy, when often during the acute phases of resuscitation from circulatory shock this approach may be inappropriate.

A fundamental determinant of cardiac output and its ability to vary in response to changing metabolic demands is the body's effective circulating blood volume. Total circulating blood volume is distributed throughout the circulatory system into vessels that can initially be filled without changing their distending pressures because they merely alter their conformation rather than stretch, rather like a large empty balloon that will not have any measurable distending pressure when air is initially blown into it. Once filled beyond this volume, however, wherein conformational changes alone cannot accept more air without requiring the balloon's walls to stretch, the distending pressure will start to increase. The volume in the balloon below this point is called its unstressed volume. In the body, this unstressed volume accounts for between 60 and 70% of the total circulating blood volume. As illustrated in Fig. 1, the amount of unstressed volume can be rapidly and dynamically changed by changing blood flow distribution, increasing surrounding tissue pressure, or increasing venomotor tone. The effective circulating blood volume reflects the proportion of blood volume above the unstressed volume and is essentially independent of arterial pressure, because arterial pressure is dissipated across the high resistance arterioles, analogous to a "vascular waterfall". The stressed blood volume relative to the venous compliance defines the mean circulatory filling pressure, which is the back pressure to venous flow from the body back to the right ventricle. The primary reason for giving fluids during resuscitation is to increase the stressed circulatory blood volume, thus causing mean circulatory filling pressure to rise. If the heart can handle this increased driving pressure, then venous return increases causing cardiac output to rise. If the effective circulating blood volume is low, then mean circulatory filling pressure is also low, and if the effective circulating blood volume is high, then mean circulatory filling pressure is also high.

### Impact of the fluid challenge infusion rate on cardiac stroke volume during major spinal neurosurgery: a prospective single center randomized interventional trial [^1114AeLn]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Fluid therapy is daily routine practice in every operating theatre before, during, and after surgery. While the goal of every volume administration is preserving hemodynamic stability and intracellular homeostasis, a distinction can be made between maintenance and restoration fluid therapy. Perioperative maintenance fluid continuously provides daily water and electrolyte requirements, while restoration and resuscitation fluids replace blood and fluid losses to ensure sufficient cardiac preload and oxygen delivery. Fluids are often administered as bolus infusions delivering a particular volume in a limited time. Balanced isotonic crystalloid solutions are the most frequent fluid type used for fluid maintenance. However, the intravascular volume effect of crystalloids is low and hemodynamic resuscitation with colloids was found to be faster and required less amount of fluid in patients with clinical hypovolemia compared to the same volume of crystalloids. However, the choice of fluid, the execution of a volume bolus, and a patient's expected volume need are characterized by strong local and inter-individual variability. Therefore, goal directed fluid therapy (GDT) has been widely used in clinical practice where fluid boluses are guided by cardiac stroke volume (SV), or dynamic preload parameters such as pulse pressure variation (PPV) and stroke volume variation (SVV). Although preload-guided fluid restoration is primarily performed using consecutive steps of a fixed volume of infusion, the period in which a fluid challenge is performed largely differs among protocols, from as fast as possible to less than 5 or 10 min, or within 15 min. However, the effect of the time within a fluid bolus is administered on the hemodynamic response relating to cardiac SV and other hemodynamic parameters remains largely unknown. Thus, we hypothesized that a higher infusion rate may trigger a stronger hemodynamic response after a distinct fluid challenge. Consequently, this randomized controlled trial aimed to evaluate the impact of two different infusion rates on cardiac SV, after fluid challenges triggered by PPV.

The pleural space in healthy humans was thought to contain a few milliliters of fluid, based on extrapolation from animal studies. However, because of the obvious technical difficulties in atraumatically retrieving such a small volume of fluid, the exact volume and cellular content of human pleural fluid has not been known. Development of a minimally invasive pleural lavage technique has allowed, for the first time, the measurement of volume and cellular content of the pleural fluid in healthy humans.

Postoperative collections

Postoperative fluid collection in the operative bed may represent seroma, CSF collection, haematoma, or abscess and can cause symptoms by compression of the thecal sac or nerve roots. Haematoma presents in hours to days following surgery, with the vast majority in the subcutaneous or epidural space. MR is able to distinguish haematoma from seroma better than CT by fluid signal characteristics; however, in many cases, the signal characteristics are not specific. Gradient sequences, useful for identifying haematomas elsewhere, are of little value in the setting of metallic hardware constructs because of extensive artefacts, as described earlier. MR is able to delineate the size of the fluid collection and whether it communicates with the spinal canal determining compression of the thecal sac. Compression of the thecal sac is a common finding, occurring in 58% of cases reported by one study, none with new postoperative neurologic deficits. This study demonstrated that, on average, haematomas extended half a vertebral body beyond the decompression. Less than 1% of postoperative haematomas require evacuation for decompression. However, neurologic recovery depends on the degree of deficit and the time of decompression; thus early diagnosis is critical. Even with contrast enhancement, superinfection is difficult to assess, as there is extensive adjacent enhancing soft tissue and granulation tissue around all collections. Ultrasound plays an important diagnostic and therapeutic role for evaluation of subcutaneous collections, demonstrating septations that are occult on MRI. Use of bone morphogenetic proteins has been associated with increased incidence of seroma formation.

### Sodium chloride for irrigation [^113Xw2j4]. FDA (2021). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Possible adverse effects arising from the irrigation of body cavities, tissues, or indwelling catheters and tubes can be minimized when proper procedures are followed. Displaced catheters or drainage tubes can lead to irrigation or infiltration of unintended structures or cavities. Excessive volume or pressure during irrigation of closed cavities may cause undue distension or disruption of tissues. Accidental contamination from careless technique may transmit infection.

If an adverse reaction does occur, discontinue administration of the irrigant, evaluate the patient, institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures, and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary.

### A prospective, randomized, multicenter trial assessing a novel lysine-derived urethane adhesive in a large flap surgical procedure without drains [^1167J6Pn]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Many surgical procedures involve the creation of large tissue flaps. One of the drawbacks of these large tissue flaps is that they have a high incidence of fluid accumulation-related complications. The accumulation of serous fluid in the space between the elevated tissue flap and the underlying tissue (the "dead space") can physically prevent apposition between these two tissue layers and interfere with healing. This results in an increased risk of early post-operative complications including seroma formation, necrosis, and wound breakdown. These complications may require multiple interventions, including repeated needle aspirations, or in some cases may require surgical intervention to eradicate the dead space and enable wound healing. The most common of these complications, seroma formation, can occur in 15–52% of the patients following commonly performed large flap procedures.

The standard of care for managing wound drainage and preventing fluid accumulation following large flap procedures is the placement of surgical drains to provide continuous egress of fluid from the dead space during the immediate post-operative period. Drains are typically left in place for a specific duration of time following surgery or until fluid output drops below a specified level. While drains are effective at removing fluid, they do not seal or eliminate the dead space between tissue layers following large flap procedures, or prevent shearing forces from disrupting the early healing process during movement. As a result, up to 52% of the patients with drains will still require invasive procedures in order to manage post-operative fluid complications. Importantly, the use of drains is associated with a significant increase in the post-operative pain and hospital stays while also increasing the risk for retrograde bacterial migration and infection. Perhaps the most serious of these risks is surgical site infection associated with prolonged drain use. The use of drains can lead to the development of increased post-operative pain and discomfort, as well as additional scarring at the drain insertion site. Indwelling drains may also impact quality of life, interfere with sleep, and delay the return to normal activities.

### Perioperative care of patients undergoing major complex spinal instrumentation surgery: clinical practice guidelines from the society for neuroscience in anesthesiology and critical care [^115EAoE6]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2022). High credibility.

Fluid management and hemodynamic monitoring — complex spine surgery recommendations state that intraoperative invasive/minimally invasive hemodynamic monitoring techniques consistent with institutional standards may be used in patients undergoing complex spine surgeries (Class I, Level of Evidence C-EO). It is reasonable to use goal-directed fluid therapy for complex spine cases (Class IIa, Level of Evidence B-NR). It is reasonable to use a balanced solution, especially in procedures with anticipated significant blood loss and fluid resuscitation (Class IIa, Level of Evidence B-NR). To maintain euvolemia, it is reasonable to include colloids and crystalloids in patients with substantial blood loss (Class IIa, Level of Evidence C-EO).

### Is closed-suction drainage necessary for single-level lumbar decompression? review of 560 cases [^116fsUNE]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Closed-suction drainage is commonly used for prevention of postoperative hematoma and associated neurologic compromise after lumbar decompression, but it remains unclear whether suction drainage reduces postoperative complications.

Questions/Purposes

We evaluated the efficacy of closed-suction drainage in single-level lumbar decompression surgery.

Patients and Methods

We retrospectively reviewed 560 patients who underwent single-level lumbar decompression or discectomy. We routinely used closed-suction drainage in all spinal surgeries until July 2003, and thereafter, we did not use drains in single-level lumbar decompression surgery. These two groups (298 patients in the group that received drains, 262 in the group that did not receive drains) were compared for rates of wound infection and epidural hematoma.

Results

Mean operating time (55 versus 56 minutes) and intraoperative blood loss (64 versus 57 mL) were not different between the two groups. None of 560 patients had a wound infection requiring surgical intervention. The rate of postoperative hematoma was 0.7% in the group that received drains (two of 298 patients) and 0% in the group that did not receive drains (zero of 262 patients).

Conclusions

In this study, the risk of wound infection and hematomas in single-level lumbar decompression surgery was not influenced by use of a drain. The use of postoperative wound drainage in patients with potential risk for epidural bleeding in situations such as multiple-level decompression, instrumentation surgery, anticoagulant therapy, trauma, and tumors or metastases needs additional study.

Level Of Evidence

Level III, prognostic study. See Guidelines for Authors for a complete description of levels of evidence.

### Physiologic effects of intravenous fluid administration in healthy volunteers [^114KyNnQ]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2003). Low credibility.

Unlabelled

Dose regimens in perioperative fluid management are rarely evidence based. Therefore, we investigated responses to an IV fluid infusion in healthy volunteers to assess basic physiologic effects of a fluid infusion per se. In a prospective, double-blinded, cross-randomized study, 12 healthy volunteers with a median age of 63 yr (range, 59–67 yr) received an infusion of lactated Ringer's solution 40 mL/kg (median, 2820 mL) or 5 mL/kg (median, 353 mL; background infusion) in random order on two separate occasions. The study was designed to mimic the perioperative course with preoperative fasting, infusion of the fluid over 3 h in the morning, and additionally 24-h hospitalization under standardized conditions. Primary outcome assessments were pulmonary function (spirometry), exercise capacity (submaximal treadmill test), balance function (BalanceMaster), and weight. Infusion of 40 mL/kg of lactated Ringer's solution compared with the background infusion (5 mL/kg) resulted in a significant decrease in pulmonary function and a significant weight gain of median 0.85 kg (range, -0.2–1.6 kg; P = 0.003) persisting 24 h after the infusion. Exercise capacity and balance function were not influenced by fluid administration. These findings may serve as a basis for clinical studies applying the same type of fluid in different amounts to determine the optimal amount of perioperative fluid in various surgical procedures.

Implications

Infusion of 40 mL/kg of lactated Ringer's solution in volunteers led to a significant decrease in pulmonary function and a significant weight gain for 24 h but without effects on exercise capacity. These findings may serve as basis information for clinical studies of perioperative fluid management.

### Sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and calcium chloride (Ringer's) [^1135NJSm]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

ADVERSE REACTIONS

Possible adverse effects arising from the irrigation of body cavities, tissues, or indwelling catheters and tubes are usually avoidable when proper procedures are followed. Displaced catheters or drainage tubes can lead to irrigation or infiltration of unintended structures or cavities. Excessive volume or pressure during irrigation of closed cavities may cause undue distention or disruption of tissues. Accidental contamination from careless technique may transmit infection. Should any adverse reaction occur, discontinue the irrigant, evaluate the patient, institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary.

### Outcome after surgical treatment of cerebrospinal fluid leaks in spontaneous intracranial hypotension-a matter of time [^111rf73B]. Journal of Neurology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Shorter duration of preoperative symptoms is the most powerful predictor of favorable outcome after surgical treatment of SIH. While an initial attempt of conservative treatment with epidural blood patching is justified, we advocate early surgical treatment not later than 12.4 weeks after onset in case of persistent symptoms and a proven spinal CSF leak.

### Sodium chloride, potassium chloride, and calcium chloride (Ringer's) [^1113gEZn]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Normally about 80 to 90% of the potassium intake is excreted in the urine; the remainder in the stools and to a small extent, in the perspiration. The kidney does not conserve potassium well so that during fasting or in patients on a potassium free diet, potassium loss from the body continues resulting in potassium depletion.

Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) ions. Sodium (Na+) is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Chloride (Cl−) has an integral role in buffering action when oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs in the red blood cells. The distribution and excretion of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−) are largely under the control of the kidney which maintains a balance between intake and output.

Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal adult daily requirement ranges from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production).

Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms. Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium (Na+) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium.

### Imaging of abdominal and pelvic surgical and postprocedural foreign bodies [^116pf3eA]. Radiologic Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Every form of medical and surgical treatment, even the most trivial one, carries with it some chance of complications. This risk is usually small, and the benefit of the treatment should clearly outweigh the risk. Treatment-related complications may occur, however, presenting either soon after the intervention or remote from it. In this review, the focus is on imaging findings of surgical materials used in abdominal surgery, and of a wide array of implanted abdominal devices. The pertinent complications of these devices and of retained surgical objects are highlighted and illustrated.
