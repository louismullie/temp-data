## Question

Do pauses greater than 3 seconds always require immediate medical attention?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether pauses greater than 3 seconds always require immediate medical attention. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes a "pause" in clinical cardiology and how guidelines define it. Then, I should verify the key modifiers that change urgency: symptoms, timing (awake vs asleep), rhythm context (sinus vs AV block vs atrial fibrillation), and patient population (athletes, pediatrics, congenital heart disease). Next, I will review guideline thresholds that trigger pacing or urgent evaluation. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, clinically grounded answer and clarify when immediate attention is warranted versus when urgent outpatient work-up is appropriate.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't misapply thresholds. A "pause" in this context refers to a transient asystole or marked bradycardia, typically defined in guidelines as a sinus pause/arrest of at least 3 seconds or a ventricular pause of at least 3 seconds depending on mechanism, and it is a potential manifestation of sinus node dysfunction or AV block rather than a diagnosis by itself.

> Now, I need to check the core principle that determines urgency. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: guidelines emphasize that symptoms and temporal correlation with bradycardia/pauses drive management, and the mere presence of a pause > 3 seconds alone is not an automatic indication for pacing or emergency action; in fact, asymptomatic pauses during sleep are common and often physiologic, and there is no established minimum heart rate or pause duration that mandates treatment in the absence of symptoms [^115rQU1W] [^115HrXh9] [^116LGaso].

> Next, I should review the timing and context modifiers. Wait, let me verify the sleep-related physiology: nocturnal pauses > 3 seconds can occur in healthy individuals and athletes due to high vagal tone, and they are not an indication for permanent pacing unless other indications exist; instead, they should prompt screening for sleep apnea, which often resolves the bradyarrhythmias with CPAP, so immediate emergency action is not warranted solely for a nocturnal pause > 3 seconds [^115rQU1W] [^112dzDGg] [^116qXa3W].

> I will now examine the symptom threshold. I should confirm that loss of consciousness or presyncope temporally linked to a pause is what escalates concern; syncope or presyncope correlating with a documented pause > 3 seconds while awake is clinically significant and warrants expedited cardiology evaluation, with pacing considered when the correlation is established, whereas an asymptomatic pause discovered incidentally does not mandate emergency pacing [^111YXzmx] [^112tgvJX] [^111QJgsQ].

> But wait, what about the exact duration cutoffs that change management? Let me double-check: for awake patients, a documented pause ≥ 3 seconds correlating with syncope supports pacing consideration, and in asymptomatic patients, pauses ≥ 6 seconds are the threshold at which pacing may be considered in selected contexts; in atrial fibrillation, pauses ≥ 5 seconds while awake are more concerning and can be a pacing trigger, whereas isolated pauses > 3 seconds in AF are variably symptomatic and not automatically an indication for pacing if asymptomatic [^112tgvJX] [^111QJgsQ] [^115MkiRn] [^1124pRHE].

> Hold on, I should verify special populations. In athletes and highly conditioned individuals, pauses > 3 seconds during rest or sleep are not uncommon and are not an indication for pacing unless symptomatic; in pediatrics, vasovagal syncope can include asystolic pauses > 3 seconds, and management is individualized rather than reflexively interventional; in congenital heart disease, expert consensus allows consideration of pacing for asymptomatic bradycardia with pauses > 3 seconds in complex anatomy, but this is a nuanced, individualized decision and still not an automatic emergency indication [^115rQU1W] [^113dTL2f] [^1137YXrY].

> Next, I should review when immediate medical attention is actually warranted. I need to ensure I'm precise: immediate care is indicated when a pause > 3 seconds is accompanied by syncope or presyncope, when there are recurrent unpredictable episodes with high-risk features, or when the ECG shows high-grade AV block or infranodal disease; in contrast, an incidental, asymptomatic pause > 3 seconds discovered on monitoring should prompt urgent outpatient evaluation rather than emergency pacing, with attention to reversible causes and symptom correlation [^112WE9tS] [^115MkiRn] [^115rQU1W].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not overgeneralizing. No, pauses greater than 3 seconds do not always require immediate medical attention; urgency depends on symptoms, timing (awake vs asleep), rhythm context, and patient characteristics. Immediate attention is warranted for symptomatic pauses, for pauses in the setting of high-grade AV block or infranodal disease, or for very long pauses in AF (often ≥ 5 seconds), whereas asymptomatic nocturnal pauses in otherwise healthy individuals are common and managed with evaluation for sleep apnea and outpatient follow-up rather than emergency pacing [^115rQU1W] [^115MkiRn].

> Finally, I should confirm practical next steps when a pause > 3 seconds is found. I need to check for symptom correlation with ambulatory monitoring, screen for reversible causes (medications, electrolytes, ischemia, sleep apnea), and assess for structural heart disease; if the pause is nocturnal and asymptomatic, prioritize sleep apnea screening and CPAP; if symptomatic or very long, arrange expedited cardiology evaluation to determine pacing candidacy using guideline thresholds and shared decision-making, recognizing that pacing is for symptom relief and correlation, not solely for a number on a monitor [^115tXvzd] [^115rQU1W] [^116LGaso].

No, pauses greater than 3 seconds **do not always require immediate medical attention**. Immediate care is indicated when pauses are accompanied by **symptoms** (syncope, presyncope, chest pain, or dyspnea) [^112WE9tS] or occur in patients with **high-risk features** (structural heart disease, Mobitz II or third-degree AV block, or escape rhythms < 40 bpm) [^115MkiRn]. Asymptomatic pauses during sleep or in trained athletes are **often benign** and warrant only routine evaluation [^115rQU1W] [^113vYVMg]. Management should be guided by symptoms, rhythm correlation, and underlying conditions; pacing is considered for symptomatic pauses or specific high-risk scenarios, not for asymptomatic pauses alone [^112tgvJX] [^111QJgsQ].

---

## Clinical significance of pauses greater than 3 seconds

Pauses > 3 seconds are clinically significant and may indicate **underlying conduction system disease** or increased risk of arrhythmias [^112WE9tS]. However, not all such pauses necessitate immediate intervention; their significance depends on clinical context, symptoms, and underlying cardiac conditions [^115rQU1W].

---

## Guidelines and recommendations

### European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines

The ESC provides clear recommendations on managing pauses > 3 seconds:

- **Symptomatic pauses**: Immediate medical attention and evaluation are required for pauses > 3 seconds accompanied by syncope or presyncope [^notfound].

- **Asymptomatic pauses**: Asymptomatic pauses > 3 seconds, particularly during sleep or in trained athletes, are generally considered benign and do not require immediate intervention [^115rQU1W].

- **Pacing indications**: Permanent pacing is indicated for symptomatic pauses > 3 seconds or asymptomatic pauses > 6 seconds due to sinus arrest or AV block [^112tgvJX].

---

### American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society (ACC/AHA/HRS) guidelines

The ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines align with the ESC, emphasizing symptom correlation and clinical context:

- **Symptom correlation**: The primary indication for intervention is the correlation between symptoms and documented bradycardia or pauses [^115rQU1W].

- **Asymptomatic pauses**: Asymptomatic pauses > 3 seconds, especially during sleep or in athletes, are generally not an indication for immediate intervention [^113vYVMg].

- **High-risk features**: Immediate attention is required if pauses are accompanied by high-risk features such as Mobitz II second-degree AV block, third-degree AV block, or escape rhythms < 40 bpm [^115MkiRn].

---

## Clinical scenarios requiring immediate medical attention

Immediate medical attention is warranted in the following scenarios:

| **Clinical scenario** | **Rationale** |
|-|-|
| Symptomatic pauses (> 3 seconds) with syncope or presyncope | Indicates significant bradycardia potentially causing cerebral hypoperfusion [^112WE9tS] |
| Pauses > 3 seconds in patients with structural heart disease | Increased risk of arrhythmias and hemodynamic instability [^notfound] |
| Pauses > 3 seconds due to Mobitz II or third-degree AV block | Indicates severe conduction system disease requiring intervention [^115MkiRn] |
| Pauses > 3 seconds with escape rhythms < 40 bpm | Indicates high risk of hemodynamic instability [^115MkiRn] |

---

## Clinical scenarios not requiring immediate medical attention

Conversely, **immediate medical attention is not required** in the following scenarios:

- **Asymptomatic pauses > 3 seconds during sleep**: Often benign and related to increased vagal tone [^111DXZGp].

- **Asymptomatic pauses > 3 seconds in trained athletes**: Common due to increased vagal tone and generally benign [^113vYVMg].

- **Asymptomatic pauses > 3 seconds without structural heart disease**: Generally benign and require only routine evaluation [^116k8Xcv].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation and management

When pauses > 3 seconds are detected, the following diagnostic and management steps are recommended:

- **Holter monitoring or event recorder**: To correlate pauses with symptoms and assess frequency and duration [^115tXvzd].

- **Echocardiography**: To evaluate for structural heart disease [^115tXvzd].

- **Electrophysiology study**: Considered if invasive evaluation is needed or if other diagnostic tests are inconclusive [^notfound].

- **Permanent pacing**: Indicated for symptomatic pauses > 3 seconds or asymptomatic pauses > 6 seconds due to sinus arrest or AV block [^112tgvJX].

---

## Conclusion

Pauses greater than 3 seconds **do not always require immediate medical attention**. Immediate care is indicated when pauses are symptomatic, occur in patients with structural heart disease, or are associated with high-risk features such as Mobitz II or third-degree AV block. Asymptomatic pauses, particularly during sleep or in trained athletes, are generally benign and require only routine evaluation. Management should be guided by symptoms, clinical context, and underlying cardiac conditions.

StudyFindings

ECG recordings were available in 1693 (98.8%) of 1714 patients in the intervention group (Figure S1). Median duration of study ECG recording was 120.6 hours (interquartile range, 73.3–166.1). The following abnormal study‐ECG findings were considered "relevant" and were predefined for standardized analysis in the core laboratory: (1) atrial fibrillation, (2) atrial flutter, (3) second‐/third‐degree atrioventricular block, (4) bradycardia, (5) supraventricular tachycardia, (6) sustained and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, and (7) pauses. The chosen definitions of these ECG abnormalities are listed in Table 1. "Relevant" ECG abnormalities led to an explicit recommendation requiring immediate attention for an "urgent cardiologic work‐up" (in case of sustained ventricular tachycardia, complete heart block, 2:1 atrioventricular block, pauses > 5 s, bradycardia) or a "cardiologic work‐up" (in case of the other categories) in the written report sent to the study center. Of note, some of these ECG findings may not be pathologic per se, and their relevance depends on clinical circumstances (eg, asymptomatic versus symptomatic pause > 5 s). However, all predefined ECG abnormality results were treated as findings that triggered the recommendation for cardiology consultation regardless of clinical circumstances. Additionally, the results of 172 study ECGs (ie, a predefined random 10% sample of the study ECG results) were independently validated from the cardiology core laboratory by an additional cardiology expert, resulting in a confirmation of > 99% of abnormal ECG findings of the core laboratory.

Sinus node dysfunction (SND) — synopsis and supportive guidance note that there is no established minimum heart rate below which treatment is indicated and that identifying temporal correlation between symptoms and bradycardia is important when deciding on the necessity of therapy; young, well-conditioned athletes may have resting sinus rates well below 40 bpm, and significant sinus bradycardia (rates < 40 bpm) or pauses (> 5 seconds) during rest or sleep are common and usually asymptomatic, for which anti-bradycardia therapy is not indicated and the patient should be reassured; because SND is not a life-threatening condition, the benefit of permanent cardiac pacing is essentially symptom relief and quality of life improvement, and in patients whose symptoms occur in the absence of bradycardia permanent pacing has no clinical benefit and should not be performed; procedural risk remains as complications associated with permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation range from 3% to 7%, and although PPM implantation is a relatively low risk procedure, procedural complications and death directly related to implant can occur and implanted leads have long-term management implications.

Atrioventricular block in atrial fibrillation (AF) — pause interpretation and pacing implications are as follows: Atrioventricular block should be suspected in AF when a slow regular ventricular response is observed, and a wide QRS may indicate infranodal block. Retrospective ambulatory monitoring studies conflict; in 1 study, pauses > 3 seconds were mostly asymptomatic, whereas in the other 2 studies, most pauses > 3 seconds were symptomatic, and all 3 studies mixed AF and sinus rhythm without subgroup analyses. In asymptomatic patients, there is no specific pause duration that warrants permanent pacing, whereas if pauses cause symptoms or are attributable to infranodal block, the recommendation is similar to normal sinus rhythm.

- mobitz II second- and third-degree AV block

- non-sustained episodes of polymorphic VT and long or short QT interval

- pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator malfunction with cardiac pauses.

Sinus node dysfunction (SND) — natural history and trial criteria: The natural history of untreated SND may be highly variable, and the majority of patients who have experienced syncope because of a sinus pause or marked sinus bradycardia will have recurrent syncope. MOST (Mode Selection Trial) included symptomatic pauses greater than or equal to 3 seconds or sinus bradycardia with rates greater than 50 bpm, supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) including atrial fibrillation (AF) was present in 47% and 53% of patients, respectively, and the incidence of sudden death is extremely low with SND not appearing to affect survival when untreated or treated with pacemaker therapy.

Sinus node dysfunction — supportive rationale and thresholds for avoiding pacing: There is "no established minimum heart rate below which treatment is indicated", and pacemaker complications "range from 3% to 7%". In young athletes, resting sinus rates "can be well below 40 bpm", and "in almost all cases, patients are completely asymptomatic and anti-bradycardia therapy is not indicated". During rest and sleep, "Significant sinus bradycardia (rates < 40 bpm) or pauses (> 5 seconds) are common", and with this physiologic bradycardia "antibradycardia therapy can be avoided". Because "SND is not a life-threatening condition, the benefit of permanent cardiac pacing is essentially symptom relief and quality of life (QOL) improvement", and when symptoms occur "in the absence of bradycardia", "permanent pacing has no clinical benefit and should not be performed".

Recommendations for acquired atrioventricular block in adults — Class I indications: Permanent pacemaker implantation is indicated for third-degree and advanced second-degree AV block at any anatomic level associated with bradycardia with symptoms (including heart failure) or ventricular arrhythmias presumed to be due to AV block (Level of Evidence: C).

Permanent pacemaker implantation is indicated for third-degree and advanced second-degree AV block at any anatomic level in awake, symptom-free patients in sinus rhythm, with documented periods of asystole greater than or equal to 3.0 seconds or any escape rate less than 40 bpm, or with an escape rhythm that is below the AV node (Level of Evidence: C). Permanent pacemaker implantation is indicated for third-degree and advanced second-degree AV block at any anatomic level in awake, symptom-free patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and bradycardia with 1 or more pauses of at least 5 seconds or longer (Level of Evidence: C).

Recommendation-specific supportive text — symptom–bradycardia correlation: When there is direct evidence of symptom correlating with sinus bradycardia or pauses, permanent cardiac pacing will lead to clinical improvement; such a temporal symptom-bradycardia correlation is regarded as the gold standard of diagnosis and confers the highest likelihood of response to therapy; prolonged sinus pauses can be debilitating with recurrent presyncope or syncope of sudden and unpredictable onset, and permanent cardiac pacing will also treat such symptomatic pauses.

### Intermediate pause at daytime is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and mortality: an 8-year cohort study [^115xVX3N]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Symptomatic bradycardia is the most common indication for permanent pacemaker implantation, which can result in cerebral hypoperfusion and subsequent syncope. 1, 2 In symptomatic patients with a ventricular pause of more than 3 seconds, the European Society of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines recommend pacemaker implantation in these patients to prevent further adverse events, except for patients who were asleep or on medication. 1, 2, 3, 4 However, the current 3‐second criterion is an arbitrary clinical observation with a low specificity. 3 Most patients with intermediate pauses (2–3 seconds in duration) are asymptomatic and not candidates for pacemaker implantation by current practical guidelines. 1, 2, 5 However, some patients with intermediate pauses (ie, sinus pause of 2–3 seconds in duration) did develop syncope that eventually leads to pacemaker implantation. 1, 2, 6, 7 There were no long‐term follow‐up data regarding patients with intermediate pauses and future cardiovascular events and mortality. Whether these asymptomatic patients with intermediate pauses have a benign clinical course for future cardiovascular events remains unclear.

In this study, using the 24‐hour Holter monitoring database in a patient population that was followed up for 8 years, we will be able to explore the long‐term risk of cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with intermediate pauses. Pauses at nighttime have been considered to be a physiological rather than pathological response attributed to autonomic regulation and might spare intensive intervention. Therefore, intermediate pauses occurring at daytime or nighttime may have a different impact on cardiovascular risks. Furthermore, the patterns (ie, atrioventricular block [AVB] or sinus arrest) and frequency of these intermediate pauses might also differently contribute to cardiovascular events with respect to their occurring time. We hypothesize that intermediate pauses occurring at daytime is associated with higher cardiovascular risk and mortality rate than those at nighttime.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Bradycardia and sinus node dysfunction (SND) definitions — The National Institutes of Health defines bradycardia as a heart rate < 60 bpm in adults other than well trained athletes, though population studies frequently use a lower cutoff of 50 bpm; in an analysis of 4 population studies from the Netherlands of adults 20 to 90 years, the lowest second percentile for heart rate ranged from 40 to 55 bpm depending on sex and age. Sinus pauses of 2 seconds and 3 seconds have been described during 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring in healthy elderly patients and long-distance runners, respectively. For this document, a sinus rate < 50 bpm and/or a sinus pause > 3 seconds are potential components of the definitions of SND, but the presence of sinus bradycardia or a pause > 3 seconds alone should not be used for the diagnosis of SND. With rare exceptions, the sole reason for considering any treatment for SND is the presence of symptoms. Chronotropic incompetence represents failure to reach a target heart rate with exertion relative to expected for age that is inadequate to meet metabolic demand.

Atrioventricular block in adults — Class I indications for permanent pacemaker implantation are as follows: Permanent pacemaker implantation is indicated for third-degree and advanced second-degree atrioventricular (AV) block at any anatomic level associated with bradycardia with symptoms (including heart failure) or ventricular arrhythmias presumed to be due to AV block (Level of Evidence: C). It is indicated for third-degree and advanced second-degree AV block at any anatomic level associated with arrhythmias and other medical conditions that require drug therapy that results in symptomatic bradycardia (Level of Evidence: C). In awake, symptom-free patients in sinus rhythm, it is indicated for third-degree and advanced second-degree AV block at any anatomic level with documented periods of asystole greater than or equal to 3.0 seconds or any escape rate less than 40 bpm, or with an escape rhythm that is below the AV node (Level of Evidence: C). It is indicated for third-degree and advanced second-degree AV block at any anatomic level in awake, symptom-free patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and bradycardia with 1 or more pauses of at least 5 seconds or longer (Level of Evidence: C).

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Sinus node dysfunction — synopsis and supportive considerations emphasize that the goal of anti-bradycardia therapy in SND is to increase the heart rate so that cardiac output is normalized, and the perfusion of brain and other end organs is maintained to meet physiologic demand, and because there is no established minimum heart rate below which treatment is indicated, identifying temporal correlation between symptoms and bradycardia is important when deciding on the necessity of therapy; healthy young individuals, particularly athletes, have sinus bradycardia that is not associated with symptoms, with resting sinus rates that can be well below 40 bpm, and in almost all cases patients are completely asymptomatic and anti-bradycardia therapy is not indicated and the patient should be reassured; complications associated with PPM implantation range from 3% to 7% and there are significant long-term implications for pacing systems that use transvenous leads; significant sinus bradycardia (rates < 40 bpm) or pauses (> 5 seconds) are common during such periods and have been observed across a wide age range, high vagal tone can also affect the atrioventricular node and cause transient and varying degrees of conduction abnormality that is asymptomatic in nearly all cases, and nocturnal sinus bradycardia or pause is a relatively common phenomenon; SND commonly manifests as sinus bradycardia or recurrent sinus pauses, and because SND is not a life-threatening condition, the benefit of permanent cardiac pacing is essentially symptom relief and quality of life (QOL) improvement; for this reason, asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patients have no indication for permanent pacing even if they were to have electrophysiologic evidence of SND, and when symptoms suggestive of bradycardia occur in the absence of bradycardia, permanent pacing has no clinical benefit and should not be performed.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Atrioventricular block — supportive evidence for permanent pacing and special populations is summarized as follows: Infranodal atrioventricular block regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms warrants a pacemaker. Observational data show benefit with pacing, including that there are observational studies that have demonstrated a mortality benefit with pacing therapy and that a 5-year survival benefit was shown in patients with second-degree Mobitz type II and 2:1 block. In neuromuscular disease, up to 20% of patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 have evidence of atrioventricular block on ECG or on 24-hour ambulatory monitoring, and one study found that 46.7% of patients with an HV interval ≥ 70 ms developed high-grade atrioventricular block; a large retrospective study showed a 75% lower risk of sudden death in those with a pacemaker. When atrioventricular block is assessed in atrial fibrillation (AF), retrospective studies have had conflicting results: in 1 study, pauses > 3 seconds were mostly asymptomatic, while in the other 2 studies, most pauses > 3 seconds were symptomatic; in asymptomatic patients there is no specific pause duration that warrants permanent pacing. Drug effects are relevant because atrioventricular block can develop secondary to drugs such as amiodarone or sotalol, and the benefit of any medication that exacerbates atrioventricular block must be balanced with potentially deleterious effects of right ventricular pacing. In cardiac sarcoidosis, systemic corticosteroids have reported a response rate in the 30% to 60% range, and in 1 study of 30 patients, 5 had atrioventricular block with treatment outcomes differing by timing: 2 of the 3 who received corticosteroids within 30 days had complete resolution, whereas both of the 2 who received corticosteroids > 30 days had persistent atrioventricular block.

Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Seizure-associated bradycardia and asystole — In approximately 0.15% to 0.3% of patients with seizures, profound bradycardia (ictal asystole) can occur, attributable to sinus node arrest or complete heart block and most commonly linked to a temporal lobe source. Bradycardia is most commonly defined as a pause > 3 seconds with a 2-fold increase in the preceding R-R interval, but reported pauses were commonly > 10 seconds and one study noted syncope only with asystole > 6 seconds. Rate support during seizures could theoretically attenuate syncope, and with limited follow-up, pacing appears to be beneficial for reducing syncope symptoms. Effective seizure treatment with antiepileptic medications or surgery should be considered before implanting a PPM, and rate support with a PPM will not affect any accompanying vasodepressor effect.

Bradycardia and sinus node dysfunction definitions in adults — The National Institutes of Health defines bradycardia as a heart rate < 60 bpm in adults other than well trained athletes, though population studies often use a lower cutoff of 50 bpm; in a Netherlands analysis the lowest second percentile for heart rate ranged from 40 to 55 bpm depending on sex and age, and sinus pauses of 2 seconds and 3 seconds have been described during 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring in healthy elderly patients and long-distance runners. For this document, a sinus rate < 50 bpm and/or a sinus pause > 3 seconds are potential components of the definitions of sinus node dysfunction (SND); however, the presence of sinus bradycardia or a pause > 3 seconds alone should not be used for the diagnosis of SND, and with rare exceptions, the sole reason for considering any treatment for SND is the presence of symptoms. Chronotropic incompetence is described as failure to reach a target heart rate with exertion relative to expected for age that is inadequate to meet metabolic demand.

### Implementation of diagnostic pauses in the ambulatory setting [^112mKQx6]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

Diagnostic errors result in preventable morbidity and mortality. The outpatient setting may be at increased risk, where time constraints, the indolent nature of outpatient complaints and single decision-maker practice models predominate.

Methods

We developed a self-administered diagnostic pause to address diagnostic error. Clinicians (physicians and nurse practitioners) in an academic primary care setting received the tool if they were seeing urgent care patients who had previously been seen in the past twoweeks in urgent care. We used pre-post-intervention surveys, focus groups and chart audits 6 months after the urgent care visit to assess the impact of the intervention on participant perceptions and actions.

Results

We piloted diagnostic pauses in two phases (3 months and 6 months, respectively); 9 physicians participated in the first phase, and 16 physicians and 2 nurse practitioners in the second phase. Subjects received 135 alerts for diagnostic pauses and responded to 82 (61% response). Thirteen per cent of alerts resulted in clinicians reporting new actions as a result of the diagnostic pauses. Thirteen per cent of cases at a 6-month chart audit resulted in diagnostic discrepancies, defined as differences in diagnosis from the initial working diagnosis. Focus groups reported that the diagnostic pauses were brief and fairly well integrated into the overall workflow for evaluation but would have benefited as a real-time application for patients at higher risk for diagnostic error.

Conclusion

This pilot represents the first known examination of diagnostic pauses in the outpatient setting, and this work potentially paves the way for more broad-based systems and/or electronic interventions to address diagnostic error.

Pacemakers for syncope — dual-chamber pacing can be effective for patients 40 years of age or older with recurrent and unpredictable syncope who have a documented pause ≥ 3 seconds during clinical syncope or an asymptomatic pause ≥ 6 seconds. Tilt-table testing may be considered to identify patients with a hypotensive response who would be less likely to respond to permanent cardiac pacing. Pacing may be considered for pediatric patients with recurrent syncope with documented symptomatic asystole who are refractory to medical therapy. Dual-chamber pacing may be considered in adenosine-susceptible older patients who have unexplained syncope without a prodrome, a normal ECG, and no structural heart disease.

Pediatric VVS — tilt-table testing when diagnosis is unclear: Tilt-table testing can be useful for pediatric patients with suspected VVS when the diagnosis is unclear, and seizure-like events during testing are common with documented asystole; combined cardiology–neurology evaluation may be warranted in such cases. Tilt-table testing can be useful for pediatric patients with suspected VVS when the diagnosis is unclear. Pediatric patients with episodes of VVS may exhibit convulsive movements during loss of consciousness that mimic epileptic seizures. In children with syncope and convulsions on tilt-table testing, 64% exhibited cardiac asystole with pauses > 3 seconds. A combined cardiology and neurology evaluation may be warranted in this group of patients with syncope and seizure-like activity.

### Causes for pauses during simulated pediatric cardiac arrest [^112zF64u]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Objectives

Pauses in cardiopulmonary resuscitation negatively impact clinical outcomes; however, little is known about the contributing factors. The objective of this study is to determine the frequency, duration, and causes for pauses during cardiac arrest.

Design

This is a secondary analysis of video data collected from a prospective multicenter trial. Twenty-six simulated pediatric cardiac arrest scenarios each lasting 12 minutes in duration were analyzed by two independent reviewers to document events surrounding each pause in chest compressions.

Setting

Ten children's hospitals across Canada, the United, and the United Kingdom.

Subjects

Resuscitation teams composed of three healthcare providers trained in cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

Interventions

A simulated pediatric cardiac arrest case in a 5 year old.

Measurements and Main Results

The frequency, duration, and associated factors for each pause were recorded. Communication was rated using a four-point scale reflecting the team's shared mental model. Two hundred fifty-six pauses were reviewed with a median of 10 pauses per scenario (interquartile range, 7–12). Median pause duration was 5 seconds (interquartile range, 2–9s), with 91% chest compression fraction per scenario (interquartile range, 88–94%). Only one task occurred during most pauses (66%). The most common tasks were a change of chest compressors (25%), performing pulse check (24%), and performing rhythm check (15%). Forty-nine (19%) of the pauses lasted greater than 10 seconds and were associated with shock delivery (p < 0.001), performing rhythm check (p < 0.001), and performing pulse check (p < 0.001). When a shared mental model was rated high, pauses were significantly shorter (mean difference, 4.2s; 95% CI, 1.6–6.8s; p = 0.002).

Conclusions

Pauses in cardiopulmonary resuscitation occurred frequently during simulated pediatric cardiac arrest, with variable duration and underlying causes. A large percentage of pauses were greater than 10 seconds and occurred more frequently than the recommended 2-minute interval. Future efforts should focus on improving team coordination to minimize pause frequency and duration.

### Intermediate pause at daytime is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and mortality: an 8-year cohort study [^113fsAMi]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Intermediate Versus Long Pauses on Mortality

Sinus pauses greater than 3 seconds in duration may cause syncope or presyncope, despite some patients only have giddiness or whirling. 1 Current American and European guidelines recommended that permanent cardiac pacing is indicated in patients with pauses ≥ 3.0 seconds for ventricular activity, either in sinoatrial node dysfunction or abnormality in atrioventricular conduction. However, the current 3‐second criterion is an arbitrary clinical observation with a low specificity. 3 Hilgard et al found 47 asymptomatic patients with long (≥ 3 seconds) pause from 6470 consecutive 24‐hour Holter recordings. They reported that no survival benefit was found in these patients receiving pacemaker therapy or not. 9 With this 3‐second criteria, Saba et al compared the unpaced long (≥ 3 seconds) pause patients (n = 70) with the no pause (< 3 seconds) patients (n = 81) and found no difference in survival rate after 2.2 years of follow‐up. 10 Similarly, in patients with intermediate (≥ 2 seconds) pauses, Mazuz et al found no differences in clinical outcomes between paced and unpaced patients. 11 The lack of survival benefit in pacing the long/intermediate pause patients may arise from (1) short observation duration in these studies and (2) AF patients whose criteria for pacing is > 5‐second pause were not excluded.

In this study excluding patients with AF and followed up to 8 years, we found that intermediate pauses occurring at either daytime or nighttime increased the risk of adverse cardiovascular events, including all/cardiovascular cause of hospitalization, new‐onset AF/HF, pacemaker implantation, and TIA. Intermediate pause at daytime was associated with increased mortality rate than that at nighttime. We also found that high pause occurrence frequency was associated with increased mortality rate, suggesting that these intermediate pauses affected patient outcome. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze the long‐term (> 8 years) relationship between intermediate pauses and morbidities. Therefore, intermediate pause occurring at daytime might not be a benign course if patients are followed in a long‐term duration. Future studies are warranted to elucidate the clinical significance of this association.

Top 10 take-home messages — sinus node dysfunction and nocturnal bradycardia management emphasize that in sinus node dysfunction, there is no established minimum heart rate or pause duration where permanent pacing is recommended, and establishing temporal correlation between symptoms and bradycardia is important when determining whether permanent pacing is needed. The presence of nocturnal bradycardias should prompt consideration for screening for sleep apnea, beginning with solicitation of suspicious symptoms, yet nocturnal bradycardia is not in itself an indication for permanent pacing. Treatment of sleep apnea not only reduces the frequency of these arrhythmias but also may offer cardiovascular benefits.

Sinus node dysfunction (SND) — clinical presentation includes symptoms that can range from mild fatigue to frank syncope, and the severity generally correlates with the heart rate or pause duration. Other clinical symptoms include dyspnea on exertion caused by chronotropic incompetence, lightheadedness, and chronic fatigue. Patients may have symptoms attributable to sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest or sinoatrial exit block, and correlation between symptoms and bradycardia is considered to be the "gold standard" of diagnosis, though this correlation may be difficult to establish due to competing etiologies and monitoring limitations.

### Difficulty of cardiac arrest rhythm identification does not correlate with length of chest compression pause before defibrillation [^116Tgt8k]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Performing high-quality cardiopulmonary resuscitation immediately before electrical defibrillation serves as an important predictor of shock success. Long preshock pauses in cardiopulmonary resuscitation frequently occur, as noted by recent clinical investigations. We sought to determine whether these long pauses were due to difficulties in identifying shockable rhythms or rather due to local factors during resuscitation attempts.

Design

Prospective in-hospital study of cardiac arrest resuscitation attempts coupled with a retrospective review of preshock pause rhythms by 12 trained providers. Reviewers scored rhythms by ease of identification using a discrete Likert scale from 1 (most difficult to identify) to 5 (easiest to identify). The resuscitation cohort was organized into preshock pause-duration quartiles for statistical analysis. Resident physicians were then surveyed regarding human factors affecting preshock pauses.

Results

A total of 118 preshock pauses from 45 resuscitation episodes were collected. When evaluated by quartiles of preshock pause duration, difficulty of rhythm identification did not correlate with increasing pause time. In fact, the opposite was found (longest preshock pause quartile of 23.8–60.2 secs vs. shortest pause quartile of 1.1–7.9 secs; rhythm difficulty scores, 3.2 vs. 3.0; p = .20). When 29 resident physicians who recently served on resuscitation teams were surveyed, 18 of 29 (62.1%) attributed long pauses to lack of time sense during resuscitation, and 16 of 29 (55.2%) thought that room crowding prevented rapid defibrillation.

Conclusions

Long cardiopulmonary resuscitation pauses before defibrillation are likely due to human factors during the resuscitation and not due to inherent difficulties with rhythm identification. This preliminary work highlights the need for more research and training in the area of team performance and human factors during resuscitation.

Hypersensitive carotid sinus syndrome and neurocardiogenic syncope — definitions, diagnostic thresholds, and clinical considerations are outlined. The hypersensitive carotid sinus syndrome is defined as syncope or presyncope resulting from an extreme reflex response to carotid sinus stimulation, and there are 2 components of the reflex; cardioinhibitory and vasodepressor. Before concluding that permanent pacing is clinically indicated, the physician should determine the relative contribution of the 2 components of carotid sinus stimulation to the individual patient's symptom complex. Hyperactive response to carotid sinus stimulation is defined as asystole due to either sinus arrest or AV block of more than 3 seconds, a substantial symptomatic decrease in systolic blood pressure, or both, whereas pauses up to 3 seconds during carotid sinus massage are considered to be within normal limits. Because 10% to 20% of patients may have an important vasodepressive component, attention to this component is essential for effective therapy in patients undergoing pacing. Carotid sinus hypersensitivity should be considered in elderly patients who have had otherwise unexplained falls; in one study of 175 elderly patients with pauses of more than 3 seconds during carotid sinus massage randomized to pacing or nonpacing therapy, the paced group had a significantly lower likelihood of subsequent falling episodes during follow-up. Neurocardiogenic syncope accounts for an estimated 10% to 40% of syncope episodes.

### Frequency of serious arrhythmias detected with ambulatory cardiac telemetry [^114VYd6v]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2010). Low credibility.

Ambulatory cardiac telemetry has been shown to be effective in establishing diagnoses in patients with suspected arrhythmias. A critical component of ambulatory telemetry is the immediate transfer of rhythm information to a central monitoring station without requiring patient action. The frequency with which potentially life-threatening events are detected using ambulatory telemetry has not previously been evaluated in a large patient population. All patients (n = 26,438) who underwent monitoring from April to December 2008 at a single service provider formed the patient population of this study. Arrhythmic events noted in these patients were defined as those requiring physician notification and those that represented potentially life-threatening arrhythmias. Of the 26,438 patients included in the study, 5,459 (21%) had arrhythmic events meeting physician notification criteria during a mean monitoring period of 21 days. Of these, 262 patients (1%) had arrhythmic events that could potentially be classified as emergent. These included 120 patients with wide complex tachycardia ≥ 15 beats at ≥ 120 beats/min, 100 patients with pauses ≥ 6 seconds, and 42 patients with sustained heart rates < 30 beats/min. An additional 704 patients (3%) had narrow complex tachycardia ≥ 180 beats/min at rest. In conclusion, approximately 1% of patients who underwent ambulatory telemetry for routine clinical indications experienced life-threatening arrhythmic events over a 3-week monitoring period. Ambulatory cardiac telemetry could be potentially lifesaving in this group of patients.

### DEFI 2005: a randomized controlled trial of the effect of automated external defibrillator cardiopulmonary resuscitation protocol on outcome from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [^114rjHAG]. Circulation (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Using automated external defibrillators (AEDs) that implement the Guidelines 2000 resuscitation protocol constrains administration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to < 50% of AED connection time. We tested a different AED protocol aimed at increasing the CPR administered to patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

Methods and Results

In a randomized controlled trial, patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest requiring defibrillation were treated with 1 of 2 AED protocols. In the control protocol, based on Guidelines 2000, sequences of up to 3 stacked countershocks were delivered, with rhythm analyses initially and after the first and second shocks. The study protocol featured 1 minute of CPR before the first shock, shorter CPR interruptions before and after each shock, and no stacked shocks. The primary end point was survival to hospital admission. Of 5107 out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients connected to an AED, 1238 required defibrillation, and 845 were included in the final analysis. Study patients (n = 421) had shorter preshock pauses (9 versus 19 seconds; P < 0.001), had shorter postshock pauses (11 versus 33 seconds; P < 0.001), and received more CPR (61% versus 48%; P < 0.001) and fewer shocks (2.5 versus 2.9; P < 0.001) than control patients (n = 424). Similar proportions survived to hospital admission (43.2% versus 42.7%; P = 0.87), survived to hospital discharge (13.3% versus 10.6%; P = 0.19), achieved return of spontaneous circulation before physician arrival (47.0% versus 48.6%; P = 0.65), and survived to 1 year (P = 0.77).

Conclusions

Following prompts from AEDs programmed with a protocol similar to Guidelines 2005, firefighters shortened pauses in CPR and improved overall hands-on time, but survival to hospital admission of patients with ventricular fibrillation out-of-hospital cardiac arrest did not improve.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Seizure-associated bradycardia and ictal asystole — presentation and pacing considerations: In patients with seizures, profound bradycardia occurs in approximately 0.15% to 0.3% and is often referred to as ictal asystole; bradycardia can be attributable to sinus node arrest or complete heart block and is most commonly associated with a temporal lobe source of seizures, and rate support during seizures could theoretically attenuate the severity of associated syncope. In limited reports evaluating permanent pacing for seizure-related bradycardia, bradycardia is most commonly defined as a pause > 3 seconds with a 2-fold increase in the preceding R-R interval, yet pauses have been much longer (commonly > 10 seconds) and 1 study found syncope only with asystole > 6 seconds; effective treatment of seizures with antiepileptic medications or surgery should be considered before implanting a PPM, and rate support with a PPM will not offset any accompanying vasodepressor effect associated with the seizure.

### The impact of peri-shock pause on survival from out-of-hospital shockable cardiac arrest during the resuscitation outcomes consortium PRIMED trial [^114EUXQ5]. Resuscitation (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Previous research has demonstrated significant relationships between peri-shock pause and survival to discharge from out-of-hospital shockable cardiac arrest (OHCA).

Objective

To determine the impact of peri-shock pause on survival from OHCA during the ROC PRIMED randomized controlled trial.

Methods

We included patients in the ROC PRIMED trial who suffered OHCA between June 2007 and November 2009, presented with a shockable rhythm and had CPR process data for at least one shock. We used multivariable logistic regression to determine the association between peri-shock pause duration and survival to hospital discharge.

Results

Among 2006 patients studied, the median (IQR) shock pause duration was: pre-shock pause 15s (8, 22); post-shock pause 6s (4, 9); and peri-shock pause 22.0 s (14, 31). After adjusting for Utstein predictors of survival as well as CPR quality measures, the odds of survival to hospital discharge were significantly higher for patients with pre-shock pause < 10s (OR: 1.52, 95% CI: 1.09, 2.11) and peri-shock pause < 20s (OR: 1.82, 95% CI: 1.17, 2.85) when compared to patients with pre-shock pause ≥ 20s and peri-shock pause ≥ 40s. Post-shock pause was not significantly associated with survival to hospital discharge. Results for neurologically intact survival (Modified Rankin Score ≤ 3) were similar to our primary outcome.

Conclusions

In patients with cardiac arrest presenting in a shockable rhythm during the ROC PRIMED trial, shorter pre- and peri-shock pauses were significantly associated with higher odds of survival. Future cardiopulmonary education and technology should focus on minimizing all peri-shock pauses.

ACC/AHA/HRS 2018 bradycardia guideline — initial evaluation of suspected or documented sinus node dysfunction (SND) starts with evidence for SND, which may include sinus pauses, sinus bradycardia, junctional rhythm, or ectopic atrial rhythm (all with heart rates < 50 bpm) while awake. If a reversible or physiologic cause is identified, treat the underlying cause as needed, e.g., sleep apnea (Class I); if treatment is not effective or is unnecessary, proceed to further evaluation. When there is suspicion for structural heart disease, obtain transthoracic echocardiography (Class IIa); if there is suspicion for infiltrative CM, endocarditis, or ACHD, use advanced imaging (Class IIa), then treat identified abnormalities.

### Population measurement for health systems [^115XE8pi]. NPJ Digital Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

With pulmonary disease, for example, the GOLD levels for COPD can be predictively modeled. The GOLD status levels are measured by medical devices called spirometers into which patients breathe for one second, recording into electronic medical records what amount of air is expired. These then measure via threshold ranges as mild to moderate, severe to very severe COPD, corresponding to GOLD levels 1/2/3/4. Patients at each level also have a characteristic motion, as they pause to catch their breath during walking, which can be detected by motion sensors in mobile phones. Status levels for CHF function are also standardized, but not as consistently, since based upon symptoms rather than physiology.

Care Routing involves treating the patient regarding their diagnosis and status, at an appropriate facility. A simple time-critical process is nurse triage, who consults with patients by telephone, quickly routing care to hospital, clinic, or home. Triage heuristic software enables nurses to ask questions then route care, where the digital medicine equivalent is phone software that can directly query patients before providing care advice. Complex versions utilize particular diagnoses for particular patients, with situational awareness provided by medical records from health systems and risk stratification from population measurement. This requires establishing standard levels of health status, which can be correlated to treatment guidelines. Such guidelines for health systems will typically differ based on both the text of diagnosis and the context of risk level. Corresponding treatments will vary from lifestyle at mild levels to medical at severe levels.

Complementing the treatment guidelines for overall care routing, health systems often support action plans for common conditions. These describe effective actions at progressive stages of chronic diseases. Thus they focus upon the symptoms that are actionable. Typically, early stages focus upon lifestyle changes in diet and exercise to slow progression of disease, while later stages focus upon medical interventions of drugs and surgery to maintain viable levels of functional status. For example, with the common condition of COPD, an action plan could recommend rehabilitation at early stages and intervention at later stages. The rehabilitation enables patients to pace themselves to maintain adequate lung capacity while walking, while the intervention enables patients to increase lung capacity with supplementary oxygen plus corticosteroids.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Sleep-disordered breathing prevalence and nocturnal bradyarrhythmias — Sleep disordered breathing is common with an estimated prevalence in the United States of 24% in men and 9% in women, and prevalence is higher in cardiovascular disease populations, ranging as high as 47% to 83%. Estimated rates of profound nocturnal sinus bradycardia range from 7.2% to 40%, second- or third-degree atrioventricular block from 1.3% to 13.3%, and sinus pauses from 3.3% to 33%. In patients with sleep apnea and sleep-related bradyarrhythmias, frequency of episodes is decreased with continuous positive airway pressure, nocturnal arrhythmias associated with obstructive sleep apnea are effectively suppressed with treatment, and treating the underlying sleep apnea eliminates the need for pacemaker implantation in most patients; accordingly, the presence of nocturnal bradyarrhythmias should prompt screening for sleep apnea, starting with solicitation of suspicious symptoms and pursuing additional testing if appropriate.

Table 3
Timing issues in critical illness

Although the underlying and continuously evolving patterns of injury and response usually take place below the threshold of our clinical recognition, our therapeutic interventions influence the eventual outcome due to poorly timed imposition, maintenance, or withdrawal of treatment. Foremost among those that have received recent attention are excessive sedation and enforced bed rest for prolonged periods. Undoubtedly there are others; in fact, I strongly believe that many of our current practices that encourage monotony (e.g. volume controlled ventilation, sustained drug infusions and feedings) or squelch variation (e.g. unnecessarily rigid targeting of isolated hemodynamic variables such as blood pressure) are counterproductive to long-term adaptive response.

In critical care, imprecise definitions and the impersonal approaches of randomized trials threaten to oversimplify management and encourage neglect of personalized physiologic dynamics. Randomized clinical trials, though often instructive and useful for hypothesis generation, often guide decision-making with answers that are interpreted to be 'all or none' categorical directives suitable for encoding into care protocols. Although generally helpful for treating the targeted population at large, at times these approaches may conflict with optimized care for the individual. Following such population-based 'answers', many critical care practitioners consider low tidal volumes to be appropriate for everyone, conservative fluid therapy invariably to be superior to liberal administration at all phases of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), steroids to be inappropriate for all stages and forms of lung injury, etc. In reality, few practice-altering trials have been designed with deep and detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms or account for individual variation, complexity, biological variation, and the timing of pathophysiology and treatment effects. Our current management approaches can be viewed as rather inflexible and primarily reactive management when, in fact, improved patient health demands proactive, time sensitive, and flexible strategies. The four Ds of drug, dose, duration, and de-escalation are applicable to many ICU interventions, including fluid therapy, antibiotics, and ventilatory support. When facing a complex and evolving problem, the clinician requires appropriate tools, functional probes, and careful reasoning. The need for midcourse corrections should be anticipated and frequently made in response to monitored observations or relevant variables. These decisions must be rooted in physiological understanding. Sadly, however, that educational foundation and skill set has been seriously eroded by the electronically aided, "look it up" medical management structures in which we now work.

Syncope initial evaluation — diagnostic criteria: WVS is diagnosed if syncope is precipitated by emotional distress or orthostatic stress and is associated with typical prodrome, and situational syncope is diagnosed if syncope occurs during or immediately after specific triggers listed in Table 4. Arrhythmia-related syncope is diagnosed by electrocardiogram (ECG) when there is persistent sinus bradycardia < 40 bpm or sinus pauses > 3 s, Mobitz II second or third degree AV block, alternating left and right BBB, VT or rapid paroxysmal SVT, non-sustained episodes of polymorphic VT with long or short QT interval, or pacemaker or ICD malfunction with cardiac pauses. Cardiac ischaemia-related syncope is diagnosed when syncope presents with ECG evidence of acute ischaemia with or without myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular syncope is diagnosed when syncope presents in patients with prolapsing atrial myxoma, severe aortic stenosis, pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary embolus, or acute aortic dissection.

Europace (2019). High credibility.

Asymptomatic bradycardia — evaluation, prognosis, and pacing thresholds are outlined as follows: For further assessment, a 24–48 h Holter and exercise testing can help assess chronotropic response and unmask symptoms, and a pacemaker implantation is only indicated for symptomatic bradycardia with very few exceptions. In an outpatient database, 470 patients aged > 60 years with asymptomatic sinus bradycardia (heart rate < 55 b.p.m.) were compared with 2009 without bradycardia, and during a mean follow-up of 7.2 years pacemaker implantation occurred at < 1% per year with no adverse impact on all-cause mortality. In elderly individuals monitored by Holter, longest sinus pauses during sleep ranged from 0.8 s to 2.5 s and were not associated with symptoms. Among 60 patients with unexplained syncope monitored by ILR, asymptomatic severe bradyarrhythmias including > 5 s pauses, 3° AV block, and heart rate < 30 b.p.m. for > 10 s while awake were observed in 7 patients and led to pacemaker implantation; in a sub-study, nine patients had automatic (asymptomatic) ILR activation and nine had non-specific symptoms, and in these 18 patients arrhythmia documentation showed a high probability as a diagnostic finding allowing early therapy when considered indicated. Regarding pauses, ventricular pauses of 3 s or longer are uncommon and usually do not cause symptoms, loss of consciousness is not uncommon with ventricular pauses > 5 s, and in neurally mediated syncope with asymptomatic pause(s) > 6 s there is weak evidence that cardiac pacing may be effective and useful; the 6 s cut-off is supported by data that loss of consciousness may take up to 9 s in circulatory arrest.

### Evaluating and managing bradycardia [^1172pub7]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Bradycardia is a commonly observed arrhythmia and a frequent occasion for cardiac consultation. Defined as a heart rate of less than 50–60 bpm, bradycardia can be observed as a normal phenomenon in young athletic individuals, and in patients as part of normal aging or disease (Table 1). Pathology that produces bradycardia may occur within the sinus node, atrioventricular (AV) nodal tissue, and the specialized His-Purkinje conduction system. Given the overlap of heart rate ranges with non-pathologic changes, assessment of symptoms is a critical component in the evaluation and management of bradycardia. Treatment should rarely be prescribed solely on the basis of a heart rate lower than an arbitrary cutoff or a pause above certain duration. In the 2018 ACC/AHA/HRS Guideline on the Evaluation and Management of Patients with Bradycardia and Cardiac Conduction Delay (referred to hereafter as the 2018 Bradycardia Guideline), there was a significant shift in emphasis from prior guidelines that emphasized device-based implantation recommendations to a focus on evaluation and management of disease states [1,2]. In this review, we will highlight the changes in the new guideline as well as describe the key elements in evaluation and management of patients presenting with bradycardia.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Medium credibility.

Hypersensitive carotid sinus syndrome and neurocardiogenic syncope — The hypersensitive carotid sinus syndrome is defined as syncope or presyncope resulting from an extreme reflex response to carotid sinus stimulation, with two components: cardioinhibitory, which results from increased parasympathetic tone and is manifested by slowing of the sinus rate or prolongation of the PR interval and advanced AV block, and vasodepressor, which is secondary to reduced sympathetic activity causing loss of vascular tone and hypotension. Hyperactive response to carotid sinus stimulation is defined as asystole due to either sinus arrest or AV block of more than 3 seconds, a substantial symptomatic decrease in systolic blood pressure, or both, and pauses up to 3 seconds during carotid sinus massage are considered to be within normal limits. Because 10% to 20% of patients with this syndrome may have an important vasodepressive component of their reflex response, it is desirable that this component be defined before one concludes that all symptoms are related to asystole alone, and among patients with both components, attention to the vasodepressor component is essential for effective therapy in patients undergoing pacing. In 1 study, 175 elderly patients who had fallen without loss of consciousness and who had pauses of more than 3 seconds during carotid sinus massage were randomized to pacing or nonpacing therapy, and the paced group had a significantly lower likelihood of subsequent falling episodes during follow-up.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia guideline — table of definitions for sinus node dysfunction details: Sinus bradycardia is defined as sinus rate < 50 bpm, and ectopic atrial bradycardia is atrial depolarization attributable to an atrial pacemaker other than the sinus node with a rate < 50 bpm. Sinoatrial exit block is evidence that blocked conduction between the sinus node and adjacent atrial tissue is present. Sinus pause occurs when the sinus node depolarizes > 3 s after the last atrial depolarization, whereas sinus node arrest indicates no evidence of sinus node depolarization. Tachycardia-bradycardia ("tachy-brady") syndrome consists of sinus bradycardia, ectopic atrial bradycardia, or sinus pause alternating with periods of abnormal atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, or AF. Chronotropic incompetence is broadly defined as failure to attain 80% of expected heart rate reserve during exercise, and isorhythmic dissociation describes atrial depolarization slower than ventricular depolarization.

### Intermediate pause at daytime is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and mortality: an 8-year cohort study [^111Mb9e1]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Intermediate Pause at Nighttime Versus Daytime on Cardiovascular Risk

Sinus pauses occurring in the daytime may cause syncope and were considered to be clinically significant. On the other hand, nighttime bradycardia and pause episodes are frequently thought to be benign because they did not produce symptoms. In 50 medical students without cardiovascular diseases receiving 24‐hour Holter monitoring, Brodsky found that 28% had sinus pause of > 1.75 seconds during sleep, but no adverse events or mortality were reported. 12 Similarly, an observational study also showed that up to 4% to 10% of healthy subjects had sinus pause of ≥ 2 seconds during sleep without adverse clinical events. 13 These findings suggested that nighttime pause was a benign physiological response because of the suppression of autonomic control during sleep. However, in this study, we found that intermediate pause at nighttime was associated with an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events, including hospitalization, pacemaker implantation, new‐onset AF/HF, and TIA, compared with those without pauses. One possibility for this discrepancy is that most of our enrolled patients are not healthy subjects, having chronic diseases of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, HF, and coronary heart disease. Our data represent a real‐world practice results, and most of the patients in clinics did have multiple comorbidities. Further studies are needed to clarify the clinical significance of nighttime intermediate pause.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Sinus node dysfunction (SND) — clinical presentation and diagnostic correlation includes symptoms that can range from mild fatigue to frank syncope, and the severity of clinical manifestations generally correlates with the heart rate or the pause duration. Asymptomatic sinus bradycardia has not been associated with adverse outcomes, whereas patients with symptoms attributable to SND have a high risk of cardiovascular events including syncope, AF, and heart failure. Syncope is a common manifestation, and other clinical symptoms include dyspnea on exertion caused by chronotropic incompetence, lightheadedness, and chronic fatigue; patients may manifest symptoms attributable to sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest or sinoatrial exit block. Correlation between symptoms and bradycardia is considered to be the "gold standard" of diagnosis, but it may be difficult to establish this correlation in some cases because of the presence of competing etiologies of symptoms as well as limitations in monitoring.

### Clinical impact of 3-vs. 5-minute delay and 30-vs. 60-second intervals on unattended automated office blood pressure measurements [^117J8fDL]. American Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines also recommend intervals of 1–2 minutes between AOBP readings, based in part on trial protocols. While we recently reported that 30-second intervals yield equivalent results to 60-second intervals, this was only examined after a 5-minute delay. It is unclear if a reduced initial delay, in addition to shorter intervals between measurements, will have a greater impact on measurement accuracy. Along these lines, one study noted that the difference between the first and third measurements was most important for diagnosing hypertension, as these measurements are directly influenced by rest time and the duration of the measurement period.

In this factorial design, quality improvement study performed in a general medicine hypertension clinic, our objectives were to compare patients' mean awake-time ABPM with the mean of 3 AOBP measurements obtained (1) after a 3- vs. 5-minute delay or (2) with a 30- vs. 60-second pause between cuff deflation and the next inflation cycle. We hypothesized that the shortest AOBP protocol (i.e. a 3-minute delay with a 30-second pause) would be equivalent to the longest protocol (i.e. a 5-minute delay with a 60-second pause), and these effects would not differ by delay or pause interval (i.e. no interaction between the 2 factors).

### Effect of timing and duration of a single chest compression pause on short-term survival following prolonged ventricular fibrillation [^112BCCsX]. Resuscitation (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Pauses during chest compressions are thought to have a detrimental effect on resuscitation outcome. The Guidelines 2005 have recently eliminated the post-defibrillation pause. Previous animal studies have shown that multiple pauses of increasing duration decrease resuscitation success. We investigated the effect of varying the characteristics of a single pause near defibrillation on resuscitation outcome.

Methods

Part A: 48 swine were anesthetized, fibrillated for 7min and randomized. Chest compressions were initiated for 90s followed by defibrillation and then resumption of chest compressions. Four groups were studied-G2000: 40s pause beginning 20s before, and ending 20s after defibrillation, A1: a 20s pause just before defibrillation, A2: a 20s pause ending 30s prior to defibrillation, and group A3: a 10s pause ending 30s prior to defibrillation. Part B: 12 swine (Group B) were studied with a protocol identical to Part A but with no pause in chest compressions. Primary endpoint was survival to 4h.

Results

The survival rate was significantly higher for groups A1, A2, A3, and B (5/12, 7/12, 5/12, and 5/12 survived) than for the G2000 group (0/12, p < 0.05). Survival did not differ significantly among groups A1, A2, A3, and B.

Conclusions

These results suggest that the Guidelines 2005 recommendation to omit the post-shock pulse check and immediately resume chest compressions may be an important resuscitation protocol change. However, these results also suggest that clinical maneuvers further altering a single pre-shock chest compression pause provide no additional benefit.

Sleep disordered breathing and nocturnal bradyarrhythmias — epidemiology, patterns, and treatment effects: Sleep disordered breathing is common with an estimated prevalence in the United States of 24% in men and 9% in women, and prevalence is higher in cardiovascular disease populations, ranging as high as 47% to 83%. Estimated rates of profound nocturnal sinus bradycardia range from 7.2% to 40%, second- or third-degree atrioventricular block range from 1.3% to 13.3%, and sinus pauses range from 3.3% to 33%, and the prevalence of these arrhythmias appears to increase with the severity of sleep apnea. A stereotypical pattern of progressive bradycardia during apnea/hypopnea followed by tachycardia and hypertension during partial arousal has been frequently described. Nocturnal arrhythmias associated with obstructive sleep apnea are effectively suppressed with treatment of the underlying sleep apnea, with episodes reduced by 72% to 89%. One study followed patients for 54 ± 10 months on continuous positive airway pressure therapy with a 58% complete compliance rate, and none of the 17 participants without pacemakers experienced symptomatic bradycardia during this time. Because both conditions are relatively common and treatment reduces arrhythmias, the presence of nocturnal bradyarrhythmias should prompt screening for sleep apnea, starting with solicitation of suspicious symptoms and pursuing additional testing if appropriate.

In summary, the PAUSE protocol for DOAC interruption incorporates surgery/procedure‐related bleed‐risk, DOAC half‐life, and renal function (for dabigatran) to guide the duration of DOAC interruption and timing of resumption around surgery and invasive procedures. Analysis of the PAUSE data set revealed hypertension and a prior history of bleeding as the only independent determinants of perioperative bleeding. Our findings also support the safety of the PAUSE protocol which, intrinsically through classification of surgery/procedure bleed‐risk and adjustment of DOAC interruption intervals, is designed to mitigate against perioperative bleeding.

It is indicated in awake, symptom-free patients in sinus rhythm with documented periods of asystole greater than or equal to 3.0 seconds or any escape rate less than 40 bpm, or with an escape rhythm that is below the AV node, and in awake, symptom-free patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and bradycardia with 1 or more pauses of at least 5 seconds or longer. It is indicated after catheter ablation of the AV junction and for postoperative AV block that is not expected to resolve after cardiac surgery. It is indicated in association with neuromuscular diseases with AV block (e.g., myotonic muscular dystrophy, Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Erb dystrophy [limb-girdle muscular dystrophy], and peroneal muscular atrophy), with or without symptoms, and for second-degree AV block with associated symptomatic bradycardia regardless of type or site of block. It is indicated for asymptomatic persistent third-degree AV block with average awake ventricular rates of 40 bpm or faster if cardiomegaly or left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is present or if the site of block is below the AV node, and it is indicated for second- or third-degree AV block during exercise in the absence of myocardial ischemia.

Syncope

Investigation and management of patients with recurrent reflex syncope remain a significant clinical challenge. The utility of tilt-table testing in diagnosis has been questioned, but a state-of-the-art reviewhighlighted its advantages, which include the ability to correlate symptoms, blood pressure, and heart rhythm, providing the ability to assess the temporal association between bradycardia and syncope optimize the selection of patients who may benefit from pacing. Brignole et al.studied patients over 40 years old with recurrent reflex syncope and tilt-induced syncope with an asystolic pause longer than 3 s who had dual-chamber pacemakers with closed-loop stimulation (CLS) function. Patients were then randomized to either active ('pacing on') or inactive ('pacing off'). The 'pacing on' group had a 77% reduction in risk of recurrent syncope compared with the 'pacing off' group, highlighting both the clinical utility of tilt-induced asystole and the efficacy of pacing with CLS.

### Intermediate pause at daytime is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and mortality: an 8-year cohort study [^111U78rf]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Long-term cardiovascular risk in patients with intermediate pauses remains unclear. Whether asymptomatic patients with intermediate pauses have increased future cardiovascular events remains unknown. We hypothesize that intermediate pause is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and mortality.

Methods and Results

We retrospectively analyzed 5291 patients who have pauses of < 3 seconds on 24-hour Holter monitoring. Patients with pauses of 2 to 3 seconds constitute the intermediate pause patients, who are further divided into daytime pause (8:00 am-8:00 pm), nighttime pause (8:00 pm-8:00 am), and daytime plus nighttime pause groups depending on the occurring time of the pauses. The rest of the patients (pause < 2 seconds) are the no pause group. The multivariate Cox hazards regression model was used to assess the hazard ratio for mortality (primary outcome) and adverse cardiovascular events (secondary outcome). There were 4859 (91.8%) patients in no pause, 248 (4.7%) in nighttime pause, 103 (1.9%) in daytime pause, and 81 (1.5%) in daytime plus nighttime pause groups. After a follow-up of 8.8 ± 1.7 years' follow-up, 343 (6.5%) patients died. The risk for adverse cardiovascular events, including all-cause hospitalization, cardiovascular-cause hospitalization, pacemaker implantation, new-onset atrial fibrillation/heart failure, and transient ischemic attack, were higher in daytime pause and nighttime pause patients than those in the no pause group. Daytime pause (hazard ratio, 2.35; P = 0.008) and daytime plus nighttime pause (hazard ratio, 2.26; P = 0.016) patients have a higher mortality rate than that in nighttime pause.

Conclusions

Patients with intermediate pause are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Intermediate pauses occurring at daytime have a higher mortality rate than that at nighttime during long-term follow-up.

Circulation (2019). High credibility.

Bradycardia guideline top take-home messages — In patients with sleep-related bradycardia, "the presence of nocturnal bradycardias should prompt consideration for screening for sleep apnea", yet "nocturnal bradycardia is not in itself an indication for permanent pacing". The presence of left bundle branch block on electrocardiogram "markedly increases the likelihood of underlying structural heart disease", and "echocardiography is usually the most appropriate initial screening test". In sinus node dysfunction, "there is no established minimum heart rate or pause duration where permanent pacing is recommended", and "establishing temporal correlation between symptoms and bradycardia is important" when deciding on pacing. For atrioventricular block, in acquired second-degree Mobitz type II, high‑grade, or third‑degree block not due to reversible or physiologic causes, "permanent pacing is recommended regardless of symptoms", whereas for other AV block types, pacing "should generally be considered only in the presence of symptoms that correlate with atrioventricular block". In patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction "between 36% to 50%" with AV block who are expected to require ventricular pacing " > 40% of the time", techniques providing more physiologic activation (eg, cardiac resynchronization therapy, His bundle pacing) "are preferred to right ventricular pacing to prevent heart failure". After transcatheter aortic valve replacement, conduction abnormalities are common and "recommendations on postoperative surveillance and pacemaker implantation are made in this guideline". For pacemaker implantation, "shared decision-making and patient-centered care are endorsed and emphasized", and decisions are based on "the best available evidence and on the patient's goals of care and preferences". Using shared decision-making and informed consent/refusal, patients or legally defined surrogates "has the right to refuse or request withdrawal of pacemaker therapy, even if the patient is pacemaker dependent", which "should be considered palliative, end-of-life care, and not physician-assisted suicide". Identification of patients who will benefit most from emerging pacing technologies (eg, His bundle pacing, transcatheter leadless pacing systems) "will require further investigation".

Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Sinus node dysfunction (SND) — general principles for chronic therapy specify that in asymptomatic individuals with sinus bradycardia or sinus pauses secondary to physiologically elevated parasympathetic tone, permanent pacing should not be performed; in those with sleep-related sinus bradycardia or transient sinus pauses occurring during sleep, permanent pacing should not be performed unless other indications for pacing are present; and in asymptomatic SND or when symptoms are documented to occur in the absence of bradycardia or chronotropic incompetence, permanent pacing should not be performed.

### Compressions during defibrillator charging shortens shock pause duration and improves chest compression fraction during shockable out of hospital cardiac arrest [^113SmxjB]. Resuscitation (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Previous studies have demonstrated significant relationships between shock pause duration and survival to hospital discharge from shockable out-of hospital (OHCA) cardiac arrest. Compressions during defibrillator charging (CDC) has been proposed as a technique to shorten shock pause duration.

Objective

We sought to determine the impact of CDC on shock pause duration and CPR quality measures in shockable OHCA.

Methods

We performed a retrospective review of all treated adult OHCA occurring over a 1 year period beginning August 1, 2011 after training EMS agencies in CDC. We included OHCA patients with an initial shockable rhythm, available CPR process data and shock pause data for up to the first three shocks of the resuscitation. CDC by EMS personnel was confirmed by review of impedance channel measures. We evaluated the relationship between CDC and shock pause duration as the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures investigated the association between CDC and CPR quality measures.

Results

Among 747 treated OHCA 149 (23.4%) presented in a shockable rhythm of which 129 (81.6%) met study inclusion criteria. Seventy (54.2%) received CDC. There was no significant difference between the CDC and no CDC group with respect to Utstein variables. Median pre-shock pause (15.0 vs. 3.5s; Δ 11.5; 95% CI: 6.81, 16.19), post-shock pause (4.0 vs. 3.0s; Δ 1.0; 95% CI: -2.57, 4.57), and peri-shock pause (21.0 vs. 9.0s; Δ 12.0; 95% CI: 5.03, 18.97) were all lower for those who received CDC. Mean chest compression fraction was significantly greater (0.77 vs. 0.70, Δ 0.07; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.11) with CDC. No significant difference was noted in compression rate or depth with CDC. Clinical outcomes did not differ between the two approaches (return of spontaneous circulation 62.7% vs. 62.9% p = 0.98, survival 25.4% vs. 27.1% p = 0.82), although the study was not powered to detect clinical outcome differences.

Conclusions

Compressions during defibrillator charging may shorten shock pause duration and improves chest compression fraction in shockable OHCA. Given the impact on shock pause duration, further study with a larger sample size is required to determine the impact of this technique on clinical outcomes from shockable OHCA.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

ACC/AHA/HRS bradycardia definitions — sinus node dysfunction: Sinus bradycardia is defined as a sinus rate < 50 bpm, and ectopic atrial bradycardia is atrial depolarization from an atrial pacemaker other than the sinus node with a rate < 50 bpm. Sinoatrial exit block is evidence of blocked conduction between the sinus node and adjacent atrial tissue. A sinus pause is sinus node depolarizations ≥ 3 s after the last atrial depolarization, and sinus node arrest is no evidence of sinus node depolarization. Tachycardia-bradycardia ("tachy-brady") syndrome consists of sinus bradycardia, ectopic atrial bradycardia, or sinus pause alternating with periods of abnormal atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter, or AF. Chronotropic incompetence is broadly the inability of the heart to increase its rate commensurate with demand and in many studies translates to failure to attain 80% of expected heart rate reserve during exercise, and isorhythmic dissociation is atrial depolarization slower than ventricular depolarization from an atrioventricular nodal, His, bundle, or ventricular site.

### Permanent cardiac pacing in the fontan Population: a contemporary review of indications, approaches, and Outcomes [^1122pE9e]. JACC: Advances (2025). Medium credibility.

Indications for atrial pacing

Atrial pacing is generally accepted to be beneficial for symptomatic Fontan patients with SND. The most recent 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association/Heart Rhythm Society Guideline on the Evaluation and Management of Patients With Bradycardia and Cardiac Conduction Delay include atrial pacing as a Class I recommendation in this context. While such recommendations are helpful, it may be exceedingly difficult to determine when Fontan patients are truly "symptomatic". Many are accustomed to living with severe, functional limitations for the entirety of their lives, and such individuals may experience significant clinical improvement with pacing. Conversely, nonspecific symptoms attributed to mild bradycardia may not improve.

In cases of asymptomatic SND, indications for PPM implantation are less certain. Given inherent risks associated with PPM placement after the Fontan operation, providers are often hesitant to refer such patients for a PPM. The decision to undergo an invasive procedure must be weighed against the poorly understood effects of chronic bradycardia and junctional rhythm on Fontan physiology. Currently, the 2014 Pediatric and Congenital Electrophysiology Society (PACES)/HRS Expert Consensus Statement on Arrhythmias in Adults with Congenital Heart Disease provides a class IIa recommendation for permanent pacing in patients with a resting heart rate < 40 beats per second, ventricular pauses > 3 seconds, impaired hemodynamics resulting from the bradyarrhythmia, and/or for the prevention of intra-atrial reentry tachycardia. Although similar recommendations (Class IIa) were included in the 2021 PACES expert consensus statement, there is a paucity of data that support such thresholds. Additional work is needed to better understand optimal metrics for PPM implantation; and while current guidelines may help providers identify patients with the most to gain from pacing, implantation must always be considered on a case-by-case basis.

Despite established physiologic importance, management of asymptomatic junctional rhythm after the Fontan operation is perhaps most controversial. In a survey of 154 electrophysiologists and congenital cardiologists, most felt that junctional rhythm in an asymptomatic Fontan patient was a benign finding, with consideration of further evaluation only after the development of symptoms. However, respondents also stated that they would place a PPM in a Fontan patient with junctional rhythm undergoing cardiac surgery for unrelated reasons, even when asymptomatic.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Bradycardia guideline — initial evaluation of suspected or documented sinus node dysfunction (SND) proceeds by first assessing for a reversible or physiologic cause; when present, "Treat underlying cause as needed, e.g., sleep apnea (Class I)". If there is "Suspicion for structural heart disease", perform "Transthoracic echocardiography (Class IIa)", and if there is "Suspicion for infiltrative CM, endocarditis, ACHD", consider "Advanced imaging† (Class IIa)". For symptomatic assessment, if exercise-related, the algorithm includes "If not already performed: Exercise ECG testing (Class IIa)", and rhythm correlation is addressed with "If not already performed: Ambulatory ECG monitoring (Class I)". Invasive testing is limited to "Electrophysiology study† (if performed for other reasons) (Class IIb)", and "The electrophysiology test should not be done primarily for sinus node dysfunction". The figure also specifies SND manifestations as "Sinus pauses, sinus bradycardia, junctional rhythm, ectopic atrial rhythm (all with heart rates < 50 bpm) while awake".

### Clinical impact of 3-vs. 5-minute delay and 30-vs. 60-second intervals on unattended automated office blood pressure measurements [^116tb6gq]. American Journal of Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Population

We tested 2 different delay times with 2 different pause interval times for unattended AOBP among patients of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) Hypertension Center at Healthcare Associates (where patients are referred for complex HTN management) between 15 April 2021 and 29 June 2023. As a quality improvement initiative, the BIDMC Institutional Review Board determined this project to be exempt research (see Supplementary Material 1 for details). The study began in the spring of 2021, with the plan to enroll 100 patients: 50 with a 5-minute delay and 60-second pause as an interval and 50 with a 3-minute delay and 60-second pause interval. In January 2022, in response to practice-wide changes to adopt a 30-second interval between BP measurements, the investigative team increased the scope of the quality improvement project to include an additional 100 patients using a 30-second pause interval (i.e. about 50 with a 5-minute delay and 30-second pause interval and 50 with a 3-minute delay and 30-second pause interval). Protocol was designated in advance by month, such that patients with appointments within a given month underwent the protocol assigned for that month. The final schedule for performing protocols may be found in Supplementary Table S1. Analyses were restricted to the patients (N = 212) who completed all BP assessments. Protocols were conducted using the SpaceLabs 90227 or 90217A-1 ABPM (Spacelabs Healthcare, Snoqualmie, WA) and the Omron HEM-907XL (Omron Healthcare, Lake Forest, IL), both with validation studies published previously.

### 2018 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline on the Evaluation and management of Patients with bradycardia and cardiac Conduction delay: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^113WQXpM]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2019). High credibility.

Top 10 take-home messages for the management of bradycardia and cardiac conduction delay — The presence of nocturnal bradycardias should prompt consideration for screening for sleep apnea, beginning with solicitation of suspicious symptoms, but nocturnal bradycardia is not in itself an indication for permanent pacing. The presence of left bundle branch block on electrocardiogram markedly increases the likelihood of underlying structural heart disease and of diagnosing left ventricular systolic dysfunction, and echocardiography is usually the most appropriate initial screening test for structural heart disease, including left ventricular systolic dysfunction. In sinus node dysfunction, there is no established minimum heart rate or pause duration where permanent pacing is recommended, and establishing temporal correlation between symptoms and bradycardia is important when determining whether permanent pacing is needed. In patients with acquired second-degree Mobitz type II atrioventricular block, high-grade atrioventricular block, or third-degree atrioventricular block not caused by reversible or physiologic causes, permanent pacing is recommended regardless of symptoms, whereas for all other types of atrioventricular block permanent pacing should generally be considered only in the presence of symptoms that correlate with atrioventricular block. In patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction between 36% to 50% and atrioventricular block who are expected to require ventricular pacing > 40% of the time, techniques that provide more physiologic ventricular activation (eg, cardiac resynchronization therapy, His bundle pacing) are preferred to right ventricular pacing to prevent heart failure. Because conduction system abnormalities are common after transcatheter aortic valve replacement, recommendations on postprocedure surveillance and pacemaker implantation are made in this guideline. In patients with bradycardia who have indications for pacemaker implantation, shared decision-making and patient-centered care are endorsed and emphasized, and treatment decisions are based on the best available evidence and on the patient's goals of care and preferences. Using the principles of shared decision-making and informed consent/refusal, patients with decision-making capacity or his/her legally defined surrogate has the right to refuse or request withdrawal of pacemaker therapy, even if the patient is pacemaker dependent, which should be considered palliative, end-of-life care, and not physician-assisted suicide. Identifying patient populations that will benefit the most from emerging pacing technologies will require further investigation as these modalities are incorporated into clinical practice.

### Intermediate pause at daytime is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and mortality: an 8-year cohort study [^115EFpSz]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Cardiovascular Outcomes

The primary outcome in this study is mortality. Secondary outcomes include hospitalization for any reason (all‐cause hospitalization), hospitalization for cardiovascular causes, the occurrence of new‐onset AF, new‐onset heart failure (HF), permanent pacemaker (PPM) implantation, transient ischemic attack (TIA) and ischemic stroke. Patients taking regular medication were regularly followed up at an interval of 1 to 3 months. Those with a new cardiovascular event were followed up every 2 weeks for the first month and at an interval of 1 to 3 months thereafter. Patients who did not take regular medication were followed up annually or at the discretion of the physicians. Medical records retrieved from the Taipei Veterans General Hospital were used for outcome survey as in our previous study. 8 New cardiovascular events, inpatient admissions, and deaths were identified through the ICD diagnostic codes, mention of an end point on the face sheet of the medical record, previous discharge summary, and outpatient clinic reports. Mortality was defined as passing away during hospitalization or discharge under critical condition. Hospitalization was defined as an overnight stay in a hospital ward, excluding emergency department visit. New‐onset HF and AF were identified by physician report, echocardiography data, ECG tracing, and mention of the events in the medical record. The observation period was from the date of patient registration until February 28, 2013. Multivariate analysis with the Cox hazards regression model was used to assess the hazard ratio (HR) for mortality (primary outcome) and adverse cardiovascular events (secondary outcome).

### Association between chest compression pause duration and survival after pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest [^114h2mZP]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

The association between chest compression (CC) pause duration and pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest survival outcomes is unknown. The American Heart Association has recommended minimizing pauses in CC in children to < 10 seconds, without supportive evidence. We hypothesized that longer maximum CC pause durations are associated with worse survival and neurological outcomes.

Methods

In this cohort study of index pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrests reported in pediRES-Q (Quality of Pediatric Resuscitation in a Multicenter Collaborative) from July of 2015 through December of 2021, we analyzed the association in 5-second increments of the longest CC pause duration for each event with survival and favorable neurological outcome (Pediatric Cerebral Performance Category ≤ 3 or no change from baseline). Secondary exposures included having any pause > 10 seconds or > 20 seconds and number of pauses > 10 seconds and > 20 seconds per 2 minutes.

Results

We identified 562 index in-hospital cardiac arrests (median [Q1, Q3] age 2.9 years [0.6, 10.0], 43% female, 13% shockable rhythm). Median length of the longest CC pause for each event was 29.8 seconds (11.5, 63.1). After adjustment for confounders, each 5-second increment in the longest CC pause duration was associated with a 3% lower relative risk of survival with favorable neurological outcome (adjusted risk ratio, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.95–0.99]; P = 0.02). Longest CC pause duration was also associated with survival to hospital discharge (adjusted risk ratio, 0.98 [95% CI, 0.96–0.99]; P = 0.01) and return of spontaneous circulation (adjusted risk ratio, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.91–0.94]; P < 0.001). Secondary outcomes of any pause > 10 seconds or > 20 seconds and number of CC pauses > 10 seconds and > 20 seconds were each significantly associated with adjusted risk ratio of return of spontaneous circulation, but not survival or neurological outcomes.

Conclusions

Each 5-second increment in longest CC pause duration during pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest was associated with lower chance of survival with favorable neurological outcome, survival to hospital discharge, and return of spontaneous circulation. Any CC pause > 10 seconds or > 20 seconds and number of pauses > 10 seconds and > 20 seconds were significantly associated with lower adjusted probability of return of spontaneous circulation, but not survival or neurological outcomes.

### The surgical teams' perception of the effects of a routine intraoperative pause [^115vgeMZ]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

A minority (11%) believed that pauses increased the time in the operating theatre, but a majority of the nurses marked the alternatives of "do not know" or "no change". This differed somewhat from the surgeons, where several surgeons (40% each) marked "no change" or decreased time.

A majority (82%) of the staff suggested that the surgeons should take pauses more often. Surgeons (93%) and scrub nurses (79%) experienced that the pause increased patient safety. This was less true for the anaesthetist nurses (67%) and circulating nurses (39%). No one answered that they believed that the patient safety decreased. Most nurses believed that the safety issue was ascertained during pauses, even when the surgeons temporarily left the operating theatre.

Notable among the written comments were remarks like "you clearly see the increasing fatigue over time with poor concentration and high irritation", "you see that the surgeons get new energy, which increase patient safety" and "I would prefer extra door openings to have alert surgeons if I was the patient". There was no significant change in operative times from before (m = 310, SD 98.67, CI −47.8; 11.7) to after (m = 328, SD 94.38, CI −47.7; 11.7, p = 0.233) introduction of the pause routine.

### Intermediate pause at daytime is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and mortality: an 8-year cohort study [^113pNsc8]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Intermediate Pauses and New‐Onset AF

Sick sinus syndrome is the aging process involving the sinoatrial node and atrial myocardium, leading atrial fibrosis and the development of AF. 14, 15 Bradycardia per se might stimulate atrial ectopic beats and enhance greater dispersion of atrial refractoriness, and both are vital factors for initiating AF. 16 An experimental study also found that interrupted electrical connection between the sinoatrial node and pulmonary veins might facilitate burst firing of the pulmonary veins and occurrence of AF. 17 Therefore, up to 50% of sick sinus syndrome patients with long pauses are accompanied by paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, and most of them were AF. 18, 19 In this study, we observed that patients with only intermediate pauses, either at daytime or nighttime, are associated increased risk of new‐onset AF, which is consistent with previous clinical and experimental studies. This finding suggests that patients with intermediate pauses might share similar pathophysiological processes with sick sinus syndrome patients. Early intervention, including medication and catheter ablation to prevent atrial remodeling, might decrease the risk of developing AF, even in patients with intermediate pauses. Further prospective studies are warranted to validate this hypothesis.

Intermediate pause occurring at daytime or nighttime increased the risk of adverse cardiovascular events, and these pauses occurring at daytime, either daytime only or daytime plus nighttime, were correlated to raising mortality rate in this study. Although PPM implantation is not indicated for patients with intermediate pause according to the current guidelines, these patients did have increased risk for future pacemaker implantation observed in this study. 1, 5 Intermediate pause might therefore be a subclinical harbinger for future long pauses that warrant pacemaker implantation, especially in those who developed mild symptoms such as dizziness or whirling. In daily clinical practice, physicians should pay more attention to this group of patients and intensively follow them up. An electrophysiology study might be considered to elucidate the uncovered sinus or atrioventricular nodal dysfunction in intermediate pause patients with presyncope or fainting. 20 Clinicians should also be aware of the symptoms of AF and HF, such as palpitations or exercise intolerance in patients with intermediate pauses because they have increased risk of new‐onset AF and HF. Keeping an eye on these symptoms and timely administration/adjustment of anticoagulation and HF medication might prevent stroke and HF hospitalization in these patients. Finally, early and adequate treatment for underlying comorbidities might also be helpful to reduce future cardiovascular risk in intermediate pause patients.

Sinus node dysfunction (SND) symptomatic management — oral theophylline may be considered when symptoms are difficult to attribute directly to SND or when permanent pacing is not pursued. A trial of oral theophylline may be considered to help correlate symptoms with bradycardia; in a randomized study, theophylline was associated with increased resting heart rate compared with control although permanent pacing was superior for symptom control; in a nonrandomized case series, theophylline 200–400 mg daily decreased sinus pauses and improved subjective symptoms in 16 of 17 patients; and in patients unwilling or not candidates for pacemaker implantation, oral theophylline could be considered for treatment of symptomatic SND.

Heart Rhythm (2011). Medium credibility.

Oversensing during electrosurgery in cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) — clinical consequences and mitigation: By far, the most frequent CIED interaction with EMI is oversensing, and the result of oversensing on the pacing function of a CIED is inappropriate inhibition of pacing output; implantable defibrillators require a certain duration of continuous high-rate sensing (typically several seconds or more) to fulfill arrhythmia detection criteria, so short bursts of electrosurgery that are punctuated by several-second pauses are less likely to result in false tachyarrhythmia detection; in pacemaker-dependent contexts, short electrosurgical bursts limited to 4 to 5 seconds are unlikely to result in significant hemodynamic compromise for the majority of patients; therefore, in many instances, limiting electrosurgery usage to short bursts may be a safer approach to patient-CIED management than either reprogramming the CIED or placing a magnet over the pulse generator.

### Clinical approach to cardiac pauses in congenital central hypoventilation syndrome [^11585QWZ]. Pediatric Pulmonology (2019). Medium credibility.

Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) patients may have heart rhythm disorders related to autonomic nervous system dysfunction such as, sinus bradycardia and transient asystole with potentially dramatic syncopal events. The diagnosis of these cardiac alterations may be challenging with conventional periodical Holter monitoring. The case shows how continuous heart rhythm monitoring provided by the implantable cardiac monitor (ICM) may play a crucial role for their early diagnosis and the choice of the appropriate therapeutic intervention.

Vasovagal syncope — natural history and treatment framing — is generally benign with clusters of syncopes interspersed with long quiescent periods without recurrences; younger and older individuals differ markedly, with the latter group more likely to have complicating comorbidities and medical therapies; despite the apparently benign profile, patients with frequent episodes occasionally need treatment, and when considering therapy it is important to weigh the natural history, potential for harm, and the marked reduction in syncope seen in all control arms of randomized trials against symptom severity and overall likelihood of treatment efficacy.

Heart Rhythm (2014). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for permanent pacing in adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) — Class I–III indications and cautions are specified. Class I: "Permanent pacing is recommended for adults with CHD and symptomatic sinus node dysfunction, including documented sinus bradycardia or chronotropic incompetence that is intrinsic or secondary to required drug therapy. Devices that minimize ventricular pacing are preferred". Also, "Permanent pacing is recommended in adults with CHD and symptomatic bradycardia in conjunction with any degree of AV block or with ventricular arrhythmias presumed to be due to AV block", "Permanent pacing is recommended in adults with congenital complete AV block and a wide QRS escape rhythm, complex ventricular ectopy, or ventricular dysfunction", and "Permanent pacing is recommended for adults with CHD and postoperative high-grade second- or third-degree AV block that is not expected to resolve". Class IIa: "Permanent pacing is reasonable for adults with CHD and impaired hemodynamics, as assessed by noninvasive or invasive means, due to sinus bradycardia or loss of AV synchrony", "Permanent pacing is reasonable for adults with CHD and sinus or junctional bradycardia for the prevention of recurrent IART", "Permanent pacing is reasonable in adults with congenital complete AV block and an average daytime resting heart rate < 50 bpm", and "Permanent pacing is reasonable for adults with complex CHD and an awake resting heart rate (sinus or junctional) < 40 bpm or ventricular pauses > 3 seconds". Class IIb: "Permanent pacing may be reasonable in adults with CHD of moderate complexity and an awake resting heart rate (sinus or junctional) < 40 bpm or ventricular pauses > 3 seconds", and "Permanent pacing may be considered in adults with CHD, a history of transient postoperative complete AV block, and residual bifascicular block". Class III: "Pacing is not indicated in asymptomatic adults with CHD and bifascicular block with or without first-degree AV block in the absence of a history of transient complete AV block". Additionally, "Endocardial leads are generally avoided in adults with CHD and intracardiac shunts. Risk assessment regarding hemodynamic circumstances, concomitant anticoagulation, shunt closure prior to endocardial lead placement, or alternative approaches for lead access should be individualized".

Heart Rhythm (2019). High credibility.

Managing episodes of bradycardia associated with postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) — AF occurs commonly after cardiac surgery in adults, with a peak incidence 2 to 4 days postoperatively and an overall incidence ranging from 10% to 65%; postoperative AF occurs more frequently in patients undergoing valve surgery than in those undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass graft; bradycardia may take several forms in these patients, including slow ventricular response during AF and prolonged sinus pauses after sinus rhythm is restored; a slow and regular ventricular response during AF usually indicates complete heart block, and pacing may be required if resolution does not occur; in general, bradyarrhythmias in the setting of postoperative AF should be treated similarly to those occurring in the nonoperative setting, and a period of watchful waiting rather than early PPM implantation is generally used; in occasional patients with refractory AF with rapid ventricular responses associated with significant SND limiting rate control drugs, a PPM may be required for adequate AF management.

### Detection of asymptomatic arrhythmias in unexplained syncope [^113mAGyQ]. American Heart Journal (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Although electrocardiographic monitoring during syncope is the most unambiguous method of diagnosing or excluding an arrhythmia, it requires recurrence of syncope with potential morbidity. We hypothesized that long-term monitoring of patients with syncope would yield significant asymptomatic abnormalities that might preclude waiting for recurrence of actual syncope.

Methods

Sixty patients (age, 67 ± 16 years; 27 men) with recurrent unexplained syncope, aged ≥ 30 years, with a left ventricular ejection fraction ≥ 35% and negative results on conventional monitoring were enrolled in a prospective study involving long-term automatic arrhythmia detection monitoring with an implantable loop recorder. Pre-specified significant asymptomatic arrhythmias were a pause > 5 seconds, 3 degrees atrioventricular block > 10 seconds, heart rate (HR) < 30 beats/min for > 10 seconds while awake, wide complex tachycardia > 10 beats, and narrow complex tachycardia > 180 beats/min for > 30 beats. Borderline asymptomatic arrhythmias included 3- to 5-second pauses, HR < 30 beats/min for < 10 seconds while awake, HR < 30 beats/min for > 10 seconds while asleep, and nonsustained wide complex tachycardia or narrow complex tachycardia.

Results

Recurrent symptoms developed in 30 patients during the 1-year follow-up period (47%), with arrhythmias detected in 14 patients (23%). Pre-specified significant asymptomatic arrhythmias developed in 9 patients (15%), with bradycardia in 7 patients who underwent pacemaker implantation. Twenty patients (33%) had borderline asymptomatic arrhythmias. Five of these patients (25%) went on to have more pronounced diagnostic arrhythmias of the same mechanism during further follow-up, including pauses of 6 to 17 seconds duration in 3 patients.

Conclusion

Long-term monitoring of patients with unexplained syncope with automatic arrhythmia detection demonstrated that significant asymptomatic arrhythmias were seen more frequently than anticipated, leading to a change in patient treatment. Automatic arrhythmia detection provides incremental diagnostic usefulness in long-term monitoring of patients with syncope.

### Pause-dependent polymorphic ventricular tachycardia during long-term treatment with dofetilide: a placebo-controlled, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator-based evaluation [^114wKoMd]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2001). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare the incidence of pause-dependent polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT) in patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) randomly assigned to the QT-prolonging antiarrhythmic dofetilide or placebo.

Background

Drug-related torsade de pointes (TdP) is usually recognized within days of initiating therapy, but its incidence during long-term therapy is unknown.

Methods

We assessed the frequency of TdP and ICD electrograms compatible with TdP in a multicenter study that randomized ICD patients to placebo (n = 87) or dofetilide (n = 87). As reported elsewhere, the number of patients with a primary trial end point (ICD intervention for VT or ventricular fibrillation) was similar in the two groups. For this analysis, a qualifying event was TdP (on electrocardiogram) or an intracardiac electrogram showing pause-dependent PVT.

Results

A total of 620 electrograms obtained in 131 patients were analyzed blindly by prospectively defined criteria for episodes of pause-dependent polymorphic VT. These were identified in 15/87 (17%) patients receiving dofetilide and 5/87 (6%) patients on placebo (p < 0.05). Five of these episodes were early (< 3 days), all of which were TdP on dofetilide. There were 15 late events, 10 on dofetilide and five on placebo (p = 0.29). The median time to a late event was 22 days (range 6 to 107 days) for dofetilide and 99 days (range 34 to 207 days) for placebo.

Conclusions

Pause-dependent PVT was more common among patients receiving dofetilide, although total VT incidence was similar in the two groups. These data suggest that in ICD patients either long-term dofetilide therapy is associated with an increased risk of TdP or the drug alters VT morphology.
