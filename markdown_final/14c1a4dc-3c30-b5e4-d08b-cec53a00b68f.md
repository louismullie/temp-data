## Question

How early to screen for colon cancer is strong family history of death in 30s?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how early to start colon cancer screening when there is a strong family history of death in the 30s. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what constitutes a "strong family history" and whether a death in the 30s implies a first-degree relative with early-onset colorectal cancer. Then, I should verify the core screening rule of starting 10 years before the youngest affected relative's age at diagnosis, and what to do if the exact diagnosis age is unknown. Next, I will consider the practical minimum starting age and whether a genetic syndrome is suspected. After that, I should review guideline concordance across major societies and the strength of evidence. Finally, I will synthesize a clear recommendation and note special considerations like documentation, intervals, and when to refer for genetic counseling.

> Let me first confirm the risk category. A death in the 30s from colorectal cancer in a first-degree relative (parent, sibling, or child) meets the definition of early-onset disease and places the patient at increased risk, warranting earlier screening than average-risk adults, and this pattern is specifically highlighted in contemporary guidelines as a high-risk family history scenario [^f26a03d3] [^3eac615a] [^e1e6c277].

> Now, I need to check the core rule. The standard recommendation is to begin colonoscopy screening 10 years before the age at diagnosis of the youngest affected first-degree relative, or at age 40, whichever comes first; this is consistently endorsed by the AGA 2023 Clinical Practice Update, the ACG 2021 guidelines, and the US Multi-Society Task Force, and it is reflected in primary care guidance as well [^a3655a8e] [^e1e6c277] [^40f1a56a] [^390b568a].

> Wait, let me verify the calculation in this specific case. If the relative was diagnosed at age 35, then 10 years earlier is age 25; if diagnosed at 39, that would be age 29; if the exact diagnosis age is unknown but death occurred in the 30s, a conservative approach is to assume diagnosis around age 35 and thus start at age 25, recognizing that starting earlier than 25 is generally not recommended in the absence of a hereditary syndrome [^a3655a8e] [^e1e6c277].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about a hard floor. I initially thought the practical minimum is always 25, but I should double-check. The 10-year-before-youngest-relative rule can theoretically push the start into the 20s when the relative was diagnosed very young; however, in the absence of a confirmed hereditary syndrome, most U.S. guidelines anchor the earliest routine start at age 40, with the 10-year rule applied when it yields an earlier age, and they do not routinely recommend starting before the early 20s unless there is Lynch syndrome or another high-risk hereditary condition, so a reasonable lower bound in non-syndromic families is the mid-to-late 20s when the math dictates it, with shared decision-making about feasibility and yield [^a3655a8e] [^e1e6c277] [^45d283fd].

> Next, I should review guideline concordance to ensure consistency. The AGA 2023 update explicitly advises starting 10 years before the youngest affected relative or at age 40, whichever is earlier, for those with a first-degree relative with CRC, particularly before age 50, which fits this scenario. The ACG 2021 guideline uses the same 10-year-or-age-40 rule and adds consideration of genetic evaluation when the familial burden is high or ages are very young. The USPSTF acknowledges that family history warrants earlier screening but focuses its graded recommendations on average-risk adults, deferring to professional societies for high-risk family history management, which aligns with the above approach [^a3655a8e] [^e1e6c277] [^b7841260].

> I will now examine the strength of evidence to ensure this is not just expert opinion. Observational and modeling data show that individuals with a first-degree relative diagnosed before age 45 reach average-risk 10-year cumulative incidence thresholds roughly 16 years earlier than peers, supporting the 10-year advancement concept; prospective surveillance cohorts demonstrate that earlier colonoscopy in appropriately selected high-risk relatives reduces incident CRC, reinforcing the benefit of earlier initiation in this group [^53bde0d7] [^d024fd90].

> But wait, what if this early death reflects a hereditary syndrome rather than common familial risk. I need to ensure we consider genetics. Early-onset CRC, especially before 50, increases the likelihood of Lynch syndrome or other hereditary CRC syndromes; guidelines advise a low threshold for genetic counseling and testing in families with young-onset disease or multiple affected relatives, and validated tools like PREMM5 can help triage referral, so if there are additional red flags (e.g., other Lynch-associated cancers, multiple affected relatives), referral to genetics is appropriate [^e1e6c277] [^8e87eedd] [^73d40558].

> Let me synthesize the practical recommendation. Given a first-degree relative who died of colorectal cancer in the 30s, I would start colonoscopy at age 25 if the exact diagnosis age is unknown, using 35 as a conservative estimate for the "youngest age at diagnosis", and I would not start earlier than 25 in the absence of a hereditary syndrome; if the exact diagnosis age is known, I would subtract 10 years from that age, still respecting a practical minimum of 25 in non-syndromic families; if there are additional concerning features, I would refer for genetic counseling and consider even earlier, more intensive surveillance if a syndrome is confirmed [^a3655a8e] [^e1e6c277] [^45d283fd].

> I should confirm the screening interval and modality. For increased risk due to family history, colonoscopy every 5 years is generally recommended, with shorter intervals if advanced neoplasia is found; if colonoscopy is declined, annual FIT is a reasonable alternative, though colonoscopy is preferred in this risk category; after a normal baseline colonoscopy in a non-syndromic family, some guidelines allow interval extension, but given the very early age of the affected relative, I would maintain a 5-year interval unless new information changes risk [^e1e6c277] [^a3655a8e] [^c0825bc8].

> Finally, I need to ensure documentation and follow-up. I should verify the family history with as much detail as possible, including age at diagnosis, histology, and any genetic testing in relatives, because accuracy of family history meaningfully informs risk and decisions; if records are unavailable, I would still apply the 10-year rule conservatively and reassess if new information emerges, and I would schedule the first colonoscopy accordingly while discussing benefits, harms, and the possibility of genetic evaluation [^30cd20ff] [^e1e6c277].

Start colon cancer screening **10 years before the youngest affected first-degree relative's age at diagnosis** [^a3655a8e] or at **age 40, whichever is earlier** [^e1e6c277], for those with a strong family history (e.g. a first-degree relative diagnosed before 60 or multiple affected relatives) [^40f1a56a]. If the relative was diagnosed in their 30s, begin screening in the **early 20s** (about age 20–25) [^notfound]. Use colonoscopy every 5 years [^e1e6c277] and consider genetic counseling for suspected hereditary syndromes [^8e87eedd].

---

## Risk stratification based on family history

Family history significantly increases CRC risk, especially with **early-onset disease** [^2d40f4ad] or multiple affected relatives [^2cabbbbc]. Risk categories include:

- **Moderate risk**: One first-degree relative (FDR) with CRC or advanced adenoma diagnosed before age 60 [^e1e6c277].
- **High risk**: Two or more FDRs with CRC or advanced adenomas at any age [^e1e6c277].
- **Hereditary syndromes**: Lynch syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), or other recognized hereditary CRC syndromes [^45d283fd].

---

## Guidelines for early screening initiation

Major guidelines recommend **earlier screening** for individuals with a strong family history:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) 2023 | Initiate screening 10 years before the age at diagnosis of the youngest affected relative or at age 40, whichever is earlier [^a3655a8e] [^3eac615a]. |
| American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) 2021 | Same 10-year rule; colonoscopy every 5 years [^e1e6c277] [^c8e873bb]. |
| U.S. Multi-Society Task Force (USMSTF) 2017 | Same 10-year rule; colonoscopy every 5 years [^40f1a56a] [^30ea26f9]. |
| National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 2024 | Colonoscopy every 5 years starting at age 40 or 10 years before the youngest affected relative, whichever is earlier [^0b00cef9] [^06c446d2]. |

---

## Application to the specific scenario

If a first-degree relative was diagnosed with CRC in their 30s, apply the 10-year rule: begin screening **10 years before that age**, i.e. in the early 20s (about age 20–25). This aligns with guidelines to start at age 40 or 10 years before the youngest affected relative, whichever is earlier [^a3655a8e] [^e1e6c277].

---

## Recommended screening modality and interval

Colonoscopy is the **preferred modality** because it allows visualization and polypectomy [^3eac615a]. Interval: every 5 years if no abnormalities are found; shorter intervals if advanced neoplasia is detected [^e1e6c277] [^c0825bc8].

---

## Role of genetic counseling and testing

Early-onset CRC raises suspicion for hereditary syndromes (e.g. Lynch, FAP) [^532d4a37]. Genetic counseling and testing are recommended when:

- Multiple relatives have CRC or related cancers [^8e87eedd].
- Relatives were diagnosed before age 50 [^73d40558].
- There is a pattern suggestive of hereditary syndromes [^df2a8ca1].

---

## Evidence supporting early screening

Evidence shows earlier screening in high-risk individuals reduces CRC incidence and mortality [^d024fd90]. Early initiation and regular colonoscopy enable detection and removal of precancerous polyps, significantly lowering risk [^d024fd90].

---

## Practical considerations and barriers

Early screening may face barriers such as limited access, insurance coverage, and patient awareness. Clinicians should:

- Educate patients about family history and risk [^57f1d14b].
- Document family history meticulously [^532d4a37].
- Navigate insurance and access issues proactively [^notfound].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Start screening**: 10 years before the youngest affected relative's age at diagnosis or at age 40, whichever is earlier [^a3655a8e] [^e1e6c277].
- **For a relative diagnosed in their 30s**: Begin screening in the early 20s (about age 20–25).
- **Modality and interval**: Colonoscopy every 5 years [^e1e6c277].
- **Genetic counseling**: Consider for early-onset or multiple affected relatives [^8e87eedd].

---

Starting colon cancer screening in the **early 20s** for those with a strong family history of early-onset CRC is evidence-based and guideline-concordant, balancing benefits and harms while addressing hereditary risk.

### Family history and age at initiation of colorectal cancer screening [^7e437474]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

To review and combine the best available epidemiological evidence, by sex and age, that may help decision and policy makers form recommendations as to how much earlier colorectal cancer (CRC) screening should be initiated among people with a family history of CRC than among average-risk people.

Patients and Methods

Combining population-based cancer registry and health interview survey data from the United States and results of a recent meta-analysis of epidemiological studies, we estimated cumulative incidence of CRC within subsequent 10 yr (CI(10)) at various ages among men and women with and without a family history of CRC. We estimated both the CI(10) levels reached in average-risk 45-, 50-, 55-, and 60-yr-old men and women and the age at which the same CI(10) levels are reached in men and women with a history of CRC in a first-degree relative.

Results

Despite major differences in CRC risk by sex, and despite the strong age gradient in relative risk associated with a positive family history, "risk advancement periods" for those with a family history were consistently found to be between 9 and 11 yr for both sexes and at all four ages assessed.

Conclusion

Advancement of first CRC screening by 10 yr among both men and women with a family history of CRC compared to the average-risk population (e.g., from 50 to 40 yr of age) appears to be a reasonable, evidence-based recommendation.

### Colonoscopy screening among US adults aged 40 or older with a family history of colorectal cancer… [^57f1d14b]. CDC (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract Introduction Colonoscopy screening reduces colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. CRC screening is recommended at age 50 for average-risk people. Screening of first-degree relatives of CRC patients is recommended to begin at age 40 or 10 years before the age at diagnosis of the youngest relative diagnosed with CRC. CRC incidence has increased recently among younger Americans while it has declined among older Americans. The objective of this study was to determine whether first-degree relatives of CRC patients are being screened according to recommended guidelines. Because colonoscopy allows for the removal of benign polyps that cause 75% to 80% of CRCs, colonoscopy screening can reduce CRC incidence by 83% and CRC mortality by 89%. The American College of Gastroenterology recommends first-degree relatives of CRC patients who received their cancer diagnosis before age 60 to begin colonoscopy screening at age 40.

Discussion The key finding of this study is that first-degree relatives younger than the conventional screening age of 50 were less likely than adults aged 50 or older to have had a colonoscopy. Although studies document screening rates among first-degree relatives of inherited CRC syndromes, few studies are available on first-degree relatives of sporadic CRC patients, even though they are the largest higher-risk subgroup in the population. Our study shows the need for increasing screening rates in this subgroup, particularly first-degree relatives younger than 50 because of the recent increase in CRC among American adults in this age group. Our findings are also consistent with the findings of single-center studies. A practice-based patient survey in 2004 showed a colonoscopy rate of 29. 6% among first-degree relatives younger than 50 and a rate of 76% among first-degree relatives aged 50 or older.

Only 39% of first-degree relatives younger than 50 had ever been asked by their physician about a CRC family history, and almost half believed that screening should begin at age 50. Despite these limitations, our study is important in highlighting that first-degree relatives aged 40 to 49 of CRC patients are an undertargeted group for focused promotion of CRC prevention. Screening promotion should target both physicians and patients: alerting primary care physicians to engage younger patients in learning about a potential CRC family history and educating CRC patients to alert their first-degree relatives to initiate screening discussions with their physicians.

### Colon cancer screening and the end of life: is age just a number? [^229d954e]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Age is the strongest risk factor for colorectal cancer. Although there is updated guidance for the age at which to start screening, there is little guidance for individuals or their medical teams on how to decide when to stop. Current recommendations from the US Preventive Services Task Force and other societies focus primarily on age. For patients older than 85 years, guidelines discourage screening because the harms largely outweigh benefits. Although at a population level, the overall benefit of screening in older individuals decreases, one must individualize the recommendation based on comorbidities, functional status, screening history, and gender-not solely base it on age. Patient and caregiver preferences must also be thoroughly explored. Current models struggle with incorporating other colorectal cancer risk factors such as family history, previous adenomas, and modality of previous screening into recommendations and simulations, but are likely to improve with machine learning and whole electronic health record prediction-based approaches.

Risk assessment — Approximately 20% of colon cancer cases are associated with familial clustering, and first-degree relatives of patients with colorectal adenomas or invasive colorectal cancer (CRC) are at increased risk for CRC; genetic susceptibility includes Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis. It is recommended that all patients with colon cancer be queried regarding their family history and considered for risk assessment, as detailed in the NCCN Guidelines for Colorectal Cancer Screening, and results from a randomized controlled trial suggest that most individuals without a personal history of CRC and with one first-degree relative with CRC diagnosed before age 50 years or two first-degree relatives with CRC diagnosed at any age can safely be screened with colonoscopy every 6 years.

MSTF recommendations for CRC screening — family history and age-based guidance — specify that persons with a history of colorectal cancer (CRC) or a documented advanced adenoma in a first-degree relative aged < 60 years or 2 first-degree relatives at any age are recommended to undergo screening by colonoscopy every 5 years, beginning 10 years before the age at diagnosis of the youngest affected relative, or at age 40, whichever is earlier. For persons with a single first-degree relative diagnosed at ≥ 60 years with CRC or an advanced adenoma, average-risk screening options can be offered beginning at age 40 years. The incidence of CRC is rising in persons under age 50, and patients under age 50 with bleeding symptoms consistent with a colorectal source should be aggressively evaluated and treated. We suggest that screening begin at age 45 in African Americans. Discontinuation of screening should be considered when patients who are up to date with screening and have had negative screening tests, particularly colonoscopy, reach age 75 years or when life expectancy is < 10 years, and persons without prior screening should be considered for screening up to age 85 years depending on comorbid conditions and life expectancy.

### Colorectal cancer screening [^b4852c51]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

During the past decade we have seen dramatic advances in colon cancer screening. Reduction in mortality in average risk screening for colorectal cancer has now been shown in multiple trials. Efforts to increase public awareness and compliance with evidence-based screening guidelines are underway. Recent guidelines have incorporated family history, as it has been identified as a common risk factor. The genes responsible for the inherited syndromes of colon cancer have been identified and genetic testing is available. Currently, screening the average risk population over the age of 50 would reduce mortality from colon cancer by 50%. Future advances will likely include improved screening tests, and the development of familial genetic testing.

NCCN Colon cancer — risk assessment and family history screening emphasize that approximately 20% of colon cancer cases are associated with familial clustering, and first-degree relatives of patients with colorectal adenomas or invasive colorectal cancer (CRC) are at increased risk for CRC; genetic susceptibility to CRC includes well-defined inherited syndromes such as Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis CRC [HNPCC]) and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). It is recommended that all patients with colon cancer be queried regarding their family history and considered for risk assessment, and results from a randomized controlled trial suggest that most individuals without a personal history of CRC and with one first-degree relative with CRC diagnosed before age 50 years or two first-degree relatives with CRC diagnosed at any age can safely be screened with colonoscopy every 6 years.

### Colorectal cancer screening: recommendations for physicians and patients from the U.S. multi-society task force on colorectal cancer [^16299c90]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

MSTF recommendations for high-risk family histories not associated with polyp syndromes — For Family Colon Cancer Syndrome X, colonoscopy every 3–5 years beginning 10 years before the age at diagnosis of the youngest affected relative. For colorectal cancer or an advanced adenoma in two first-degree relatives at any age or in a single first-degree relative at age < 60 years, colonoscopy every 5 years beginning 10 years before the age at diagnosis of the youngest affected relative or age 40, whichever is earlier; for those with a single first-degree relative with colorectal cancer in whom no significant neoplasia appears by age 60 years, physicians can offer expanding the interval between colonoscopies. For a single first-degree relative diagnosed at age ≥ 60 years, begin screening at age 40 years; tests and intervals are as per the average-risk screening recommendations.

### Family history and the natural history of colorectal cancer: systematic review [^50588fff]. Genetics in Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

Family history of colorectal cancer (CRC) is a known risk factor for CRC and encompasses both genetic and shared environmental risks.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review to estimate the impact of family history on the natural history of CRC and adherence to screening.

Results

We found high heterogeneity in family-history definitions, the most common definition being one or more first-degree relatives. The prevalence of family history may be lower than the commonly cited 10%, and confirms evidence for increasing levels of risk associated with increasing family-history burden. There is evidence for higher prevalence of adenomas and of multiple adenomas in people with family history of CRC but no evidence for differential adenoma location or adenoma progression by family history. Limited data regarding the natural history of CRC by family history suggest a differential age or stage at cancer diagnosis and mixed evidence with respect to tumor location. Adherence to recommended colonoscopy screening was higher in people with a family history of CRC.

Conclusion

Stratification based on polygenic and/or multifactorial risk assessment may mature to the point of displacing family history-based approaches, but for the foreseeable future, family history may remain a valuable clinical tool for identifying individuals at increased risk for CRC.

### Evidenced-based screening strategies for a positive family history [^503fd029]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

The most commonly recognized high-risk group for colorectal cancer (CRC) is individuals with a positive family history. It is generally recognized that those with a first-degree relative (FDR) with CRC are at a 2-fold or higher risk of CRC or advanced neoplasia. FDRs of patients with advanced adenomas have a similarly increased risk. Accordingly, all major US guidelines recommend starting CRC screening by age 40 in these groups. Barriers to screening this group include patient lack of knowledge on family and polyp history, provider limitations in collecting family history, and insufficient application of guidelines.

### Colorectal cancer screening, adults… [^5c29d585]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

The AAFP recommends screening for colorectal cancer in all adults starting at age 50 years and continuing until age 75 years. The risks, benefits, and strength of supporting evidence of different screening methods vary. A recommendation The AAFP. recommends that clinicians selectively offer screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 76 to 85 years. Evidence indicates that the net benefit of screening all persons in this age group is small. In determining whether this service is appropriate in individual cases, patients and clinicians should consider the patient's overall health, prior screening history, and preferences. C Recommendation. The AAFP concludes that the evidence is insufficient to assess the benefits and harms for screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 45 to 49 years.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of colon cancer [^532d4a37]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2022). High credibility.

Evaluation and risk assessment — history, laboratory testing, and genetic risk: A cancer-specific history should be obtained including disease-specific symptoms, past medical and family history, physical examination, and perioperative medical risk, and routine laboratory values, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, should be obtained; this is a strong recommendation based on moderate-quality evidence, 1B. Sporadic, familial, and hereditary colorectal cancer types account for approximately 65%, 30%, and < 5% of new colorectal cancers in the United States, respectively. The personal and family history should include documentation of premalignant lesions and cancers, age of diagnosis, and the lineage of affected first- and second-degree relatives, and patients should be asked about known hereditary cancer predisposition syndromes, previous genetic testing, and family ancestry/ethnicity. Patients with findings suggestive of an inherited susceptibility should be referred for genetic counseling. Among colon cancer patients younger than 50 years, up to one-third may carry a germline mutation associated with colon cancer.

U.S. Multi-Society Task Force colorectal cancer screening — family history–based recommendations: For increased-risk family history, persons "are recommended to undergo screening by colonoscopy every 5 years, beginning 10 years before the age at diagnosis of the youngest affected relative or age 40, whichever is earlier". Those with "a single first-degree relative diagnosed at ≥ 60 years with CRC or an advanced adenoma can be offered average-risk screening options beginning at age 40 years".

### Narrative review: screening for colorectal cancer in patients with a first-degree relative with colonic neoplasia [^25d553f3]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Many patients and providers are aware that colorectal cancer (CRC) "runs in families". A patient with 1 first-degree relative with CRC has approximately twice the personal risk for CRC as a similar person without this family history. Colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer in the United States. When providers neglect to collect information on family history, they may fail to appropriately tailor recommendations for screening for CRC for many patients. This review considers the existing data and summarizes an evidence-based approach to the common clinical problem of how and when to implement screening for CRC in a patient with a family history of colonic neoplasia. The authors discuss the varying risks for CRC given the patient's age, health habits, and personal and family histories. In the context of a clinical case that focuses on the effect of a single affected first-degree relative, the authors weigh the risks and benefits of various screening alternatives and briefly address chemoprevention, genetic testing, and future directions in screening for CRC.

### Colorectal cancer screening: recommendations for physicians and patients from the U.S. multi-society task force on colorectal cancer [^b355d3c4]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Family history of CRC and polyps — screening initiation and intervals: We recommend that screening in most average-risk persons be initiated at age 50 years. We continue to recommend that persons with a family history of CRC in a first-degree relative diagnosed at < 60 years undergo colonoscopy every 5 years beginning at age 40 years or 10 years before the age the relative was diagnosed, whichever comes first, and patients with a positive family history who decline colonoscopy should be offered fecal immunochemical test (FIT) screening. For families meeting criteria for family colon cancer syndrome X, persons should undergo colonoscopy at least every 3 to 5 years, beginning 10 years before the age at diagnosis of the youngest affected relative. When first-degree relatives have documented advanced serrated lesions (SSPs ≥ 10 mm in size, or an SSP with cytologic dysplasia, or a traditional serrated adenoma ≥ 10 mm in size), we recommend that screening for first-degree relatives of persons with advanced serrated lesions should be similar to the screening of first-degree relatives of persons with advanced conventional adenomas.

### Colorectal cancer screening: recommendations for physicians and patients from the U.S. multi-society task force on colorectal cancer [^074a5363]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

U.S. Multi-Society Task Force family-history screening recommendations — We suggest that persons with 1 first-degree relative with colorectal cancer (CRC) or a documented advanced adenoma diagnosed at < 60 years or with 2 first-degree relatives with CRC and/or documented advanced adenomas undergo colonoscopy every 5 years beginning 10 years younger than the age at which the youngest first-degree relative was diagnosed or age 40, whichever is earlier (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). We suggest that persons with 1 first-degree relative diagnosed with CRC or a documented advanced adenoma at age ≥ 60 years begin screening at age 40; the options for screening and the recommended intervals are the same as those for average-risk persons (weak recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). We suggest that persons with 1 or more first-degree relatives with a documented advanced serrated lesion (SSP or traditional serrated adenoma ≥ 10 mm in size or an SSP with cytologic dysplasia) should be screened according to above recommendations for persons with a family history of a documented advanced adenoma (weak recommendation, very-low-quality evidence). We recommend that persons with 1 or more first-degree relatives with CRC or documented advanced adenomas, for whom we recommend colonoscopy, should be offered annual FIT if they decline colonoscopy (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).

### AGA clinical practice update on risk stratification for colorectal cancer screening and post-polypectomy surveillance: expert review [^42f52fa8]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) screening recommendations and risk stratification — average risk and family history: In summary, most CRCs are sporadic and risk increases with older age. Screening is recommended for average-risk adults starting at age 45 years with several available tests. For individuals with a family history of CRC, screening is recommended 10 years before the age at diagnosis of the youngest affected relative or age 40 years with colonoscopy. Based on current evidence, risk stratification for initiating CRC screening or surveillance should be based on age, family history, predisposing hereditary CRC syndromes, prior screening, or other CRC predisposing conditions.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for colon cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening (risk stratification), AGA 2023 guidelines recommend to classify individuals with a first-degree relative (a parent, sibling, or child) diagnosed with CRC, particularly before the age of 50 years, as being at increased risk for CRC.

### How well does family history predict who will get colorectal cancer? Implications for cancer screening and counseling [^8305ad78]. Genetics in Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Purpose

Using a large, retrospective cohort from the Utah Population Database, we assess how well family history predicts who will acquire colorectal cancer during a 20-year period.

Methods

Individuals were selected between ages 35 and 80 with no prior record of colorectal cancer diagnosis, as of the year 1985. Numbers of colorectal cancer-affected relatives and diagnosis ages were collected. Familial relative risk and absolute risk estimates were calculated. Colorectal cancer diagnoses in the cohort were counted between years 1986 and 2005. Cox regression and Harrell's C were used to measure the discriminatory power of resulting models.

Results

A total of 431,153 individuals were included with 5,334 colorectal cancer diagnoses. Familial relative risk ranged from 0.83 to 12.39 and 20-year absolute risk from 0.002 to 0.21. With familial relative risk as the only predictor, Harrell's C = 0.53 and with age only, Harrell's C = 0.66. Familial relative risk combined with age produced a Harrell's C = 0.67.

Conclusion

Family history by itself is not a strong predictor of exactly who will acquire colorectal cancer within 20 years. However, stratification of risk using absolute risk probabilities may be more helpful in focusing screening on individuals who are more likely to develop the disease.

### Screening patients with a family history of colorectal cancer [^4f357c76]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Objectives

To compare screening practices and beliefs in patients with and without a clinically important family history.

Design

We mailed a brief questionnaire asking about family history and a second, longer survey asking about knowledge of and beliefs about colorectal cancer to all respondents with a family history and a random sample of respondents without a family history of colorectal cancer. We reviewed electronic medical records for screening examinations and recording of family history.

Participants

One thousand eight hundred seventy of 6,807 randomly selected patients ages 35–55 years who had been continuously enrolled in a large multispecialty group practice for at least 5 years.

Measurements

Recognition of increased risk, screening practices, and beliefs-all according to strength of family history and patient's age.

Results

Nineteen percent of respondents reported a family history of colorectal cancer. In 11%, this history was strong enough to warrant screening before age 50 years. However, only 39% (95% CI 36, 42) of respondents under the age of 50 years said they had been asked about family history and only 45% of those with a strong family history of colorectal cancer had been screened appropriately. Forty-six percent of patients with a strong family history did not know that they should be screened at a younger age than average risk people. Medical records mentioned family history of colorectal cancer in 59% of patients reporting a family history.

Conclusions

More efforts are needed to translate information about family history of colorectal cancer into the care of patients.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for colon cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, high-risk individuals, family history, USMSTF 2017 guidelines recommend to consider obtaining screening for CRC (with colonoscopy every 5 years beginning 10 years younger than the age at which the youngest first-degree relative was diagnosed or age 40, whichever is earlier) in individuals with 1 first-degree relative with CRC or a documented advanced adenoma diagnosed at age < 60 years or with 2 first-degree relatives with CRC and/or documented advanced adenomas.

### Prevalence of family history of colorectal cancer in the general population [^d7ff502d]. The British Journal of Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Robust estimates of the prevalence of a family history of colorectal cancer in the general population are essential to inform planning of provision for colonoscopic surveillance and for clinical genetics services. However, there is a paucity of high-quality data.

Methods

Computerized record linkage was used to assess systematically the family history of 160 cancer-free community subjects and thereby provide prevalence data that are independent of participant recall. The data set comprised 2664 first- and second-degree relatives of study subjects, with 148 068 years at risk.

Results

Of people in the 30–70 years age range, 9.4 (95 per cent confidence interval (c.i.) 5.8 to 14.9) per cent had a first-degree relative affected by colorectal cancer, and 28.8 (95 per cent c.i. 22.3 to 36.2) per cent had an affected first- or second-degree relative. Between 0 and 3.1 per cent of study subjects merited colonic surveillance, depending on the stringency of the guidelines used.

Conclusion

An appreciable proportion of the general population has a relative affected by colorectal cancer, sufficient to merit screening under certain criteria. In the absence of good-quality evidence supporting colonoscopic surveillance in groups at moderate risk, these data directly inform the planning of services for people with a family history of colorectal cancer. However, the clinical risk and financial implications of screening should be taken into account.

### Risk of colorectal cancer in first degree relatives of patients with colorectal polyps: nationwide case-control study in Sweden [^25a98ad8]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Secondly, we addressed another yet unanswered critical question about how a family history of polyps might be associated with risk of CRC according to age of onset in first degree relatives. We found that the association tended to increase with decreasing age at CRC diagnosis, with a particularly strong association observed for early onset CRC. These data have critical implications for refining the current screening recommendations. Although screening in the US has contributed substantially to the decreasing incidence of CRC in older adults, incidence has increased by 0.5–2.4% annually since the mid-1980s in adults younger than 50 years, for whom routine screening has not been recommended. A similar increase has been documented in many other regions worldwide. This trend led the American Cancer Society to lower its recommended age for starting CRC screening from 50 to 45 years. This revision has led to intense debate about the potential benefits, harms, liabilities, and costs. Recently, the US Preventive Services Task Force issued a draft recommendation that also lowered the starting age of CRC screening to 45 years. Since the incidence of early onset CRC remains much lower than that of late onset CRC, a risk based approach for screening might be particularly appealing for younger adults. Our observation for a strong association between family history of polyps and early onset CRC suggests that an assessment of family history might be considered to tailor screening for better prevention of early onset CRC.

### Calculating the starting age for screening in relatives of patients with colorectal cancer based on data from large nationwide data sets [^53bde0d7]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Although colorectal cancer (CRC) screening guidelines acknowledge the need for earlier screening for high-risk individuals, such as those with family history of CRC, there is limited information on how many years earlier these high-risk individuals should be screened; current practice is based on weak evidence. We aimed to provide risk-adapted recommendations on the starting age of CRC screening for individuals with different family histories.

Methods

We collected data from nationwide family-cancer data sets in Sweden and calculated risk-adapted starting ages of screening for individuals with different family histories of CRC. Family history was defined as a dynamic (time-dependent) variable, allowing for changes during the follow-up period of 1958 through 2015.

Results

During a follow-up of 12,829,251 individuals with genealogy information, 173,796 developed CRC. The 10-year cumulative risk for the average-risk population at age 50 years (the guideline-recommended age for screening) was 0.44%. Individuals with different family histories of CRC attained this equivalent 0.44% risk 3–29 years earlier than their peers in the general population without such a family history. For example, individuals with 1 affected first-degree relative diagnosed before age 45 years reached the corresponding risk level 16 years earlier.

Conclusions

We determined risk-adapted starting ages of CRC screening for close or distant relatives of patients with CRC, using high quality nationwide data sets. These findings might be used in counselling individuals about the appropriate age to start CRC screening, to optimize screening practice, and to supplement guidelines for CRC screening.

Patient population and risk — scope and risk distribution: "This recommendation applies to asymptomatic adults 45 years or older who are at average risk of colorectal cancer" with exclusions specified as "no prior diagnosis of colorectal cancer, adenomatous polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease; no personal diagnosis or family history of known genetic disorders that predispose them to a high lifetime risk of colorectal cancer [such as Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis])". Risk rises with age: "Age is one of the most important risk factors for colorectal cancer, with incidence rates increasing with age and nearly 94% of new cases of colorectal cancer occurring in adults 45 years or older". Higher incidence groups are listed, but "all adults 45 years or older should be offered screening, even if these risk factors are absent".

Family history assessment and risk stratification — In all situations, it is critical for clinicians to obtain a 3-generation family history and remain alert for features suggestive of an inherited CRC syndrome, and the age of the affected relative(s) is inversely associated with an individual's CRC risk; guidelines have traditionally used a dichotomous categorization with the age of 60 years as the threshold to designate the risk category, with more intensive surveillance recommended for those with an FDR < 60 years old at the time of CRC diagnosis.

### Clinical practice guideline on screening for colorectal cancer in individuals with a family history of nonhereditary colorectal cancer or adenoma: the Canadian association of gastroenterology Banff consensus [^bba3a7aa]. Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

A family history (FH) of colorectal cancer (CRC) increases the risk of developing CRC. These consensus recommendations developed by the Canadian Association of Gastroenterology and endorsed by the American Gastroenterological Association, aim to provide guidance on screening these high-risk individuals.

Methods

Multiple parallel systematic review streams, informed by 10 literature searches, assembled evidence on 5 principal questions around the effect of an FH of CRC or adenomas on the risk of CRC, the age to initiate screening, and the optimal tests and testing intervals. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach was used to develop the recommendations.

Results

Based on the evidence, the Consensus Group was able to strongly recommend CRC screening for all individuals with an FH of CRC or documented adenoma. However, because most of the evidence was very-low quality, the majority of the remaining statements were conditional ("we suggest"). Colonoscopy is suggested (recommended in individuals with ≥ 2 first-degree relatives [FDRs]), with fecal immunochemical test as an alternative. The elevated risk associated with an FH of ≥ 1 FDRs with CRC or documented advanced adenoma suggests initiating screening at a younger age (eg, 40–50 years or 10 years younger than age of diagnosis of FDR). In addition, a shorter interval of every 5 years between screening tests was suggested for individuals with ≥ 2 FDRs, and every 5–10 years for those with FH of 1 FDR with CRC or documented advanced adenoma compared to average-risk individuals. Choosing screening parameters for an individual patient should consider the age of the affected FDR and local resources. It is suggested that individuals with an FH of ≥ 1 second-degree relatives only, or of nonadvanced adenoma or polyp of unknown histology, be screened according to average-risk guidelines.

Conclusions

The increased risk of CRC associated with an FH of CRC or advanced adenoma warrants more intense screening for CRC. Well-designed prospective studies are needed in order to make definitive evidence-based recommendations about the age to commence screening and appropriate interval between screening tests.

### Personalized initial screening age for colorectal cancer in individuals at average risk [^cdbef2e3]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the second most common cause of cancer-related death globallyeven though there are effective ways of early detection that could substantially reduce the burden of the disease. Meanwhile, screening for CRC is recommended and offered to the population at average risk in many countries, but screening recommendations, offers, and use vary substantially between countries. For example, CRC screening by screening colonoscopy, fecal immunochemical test, or DNA-based stool test is now recommended starting from 45 years of age in the US, whereas screening programs starting between 40 and 60 years of age have been implemented or no screening is offered at all in various European countries. Besides variation in CRC incidence between countries, increasing evidence suggests substantial variation of CRC risk within populations, which has prompted suggestions for risk-adapted, personalized screening offers. A particularly relevant issue in this respect is if and to what extent starting ages for CRC screening should be adapted to personal risks. Although recommendations for earlier screening among people with first-degree relatives with CRC have long been established, other major risk determinants are not routinely considered in screening recommendations. Also, there are no established routines for translating the wide variation in CRC risk in individuals without a family history into personalized starting ages of screening. In this study, we illustrate the derivation of risk-adapted starting ages of CRC screening based on the concept of risk advancement period (RAP). We illustrate the approach using 2 major CRC risk indicators, sex and a polygenic risk score (PRS), as an example, but the approach could easily accommodate other risk factors for deriving personalized starting ages of screening.

### Screening for colorectal cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^0d3290db]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Recommendations of others — age ranges and recommendation strengths for colorectal cancer screening are summarized as follows: There is a general consensus that average-risk adults aged 50 to 75 years should be screened, and the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), American College of Physicians (ACP), American Cancer Society (ACS), and the US Multi-Society Task Force all recommend routine colorectal cancer screening in this age group. In 2017, the US Multi-Society Task Force recommended beginning screening at age 45 years in Black adults (weak recommendation) and screening at age 40 years (or 10 years before the age at diagnosis of a family member, whichever is earlier) in persons with a family history for colorectal cancer. In 2018, the ACS recommended that screening begin at age 45 years in all adults (qualified recommendation), while the AAFP's recommendations do not address screening before age 50 years. In 2021, the American College of Gastroenterology suggested screening in average-risk persons aged 45 to 49 years (conditional recommendation) and recommended screening average-risk persons aged 50 to 75 years (strong recommendation). Generally, guidelines agree that screening should either be individualized in older adults aged 76 to 85 years (ACS, AAFP, and US Multi-Society Task Force) or stopped altogether (ACP), with general consensus that screening should stop after age 85 years.

### Colorectal cancer screening: recommendations for physicians and patients from the U.S. multi-society task force on colorectal cancer [^7fbc1635]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2017). Medium credibility.

Family history of adenomas — We no longer recommend that persons with a family history of adenomas in a first-degree relative undergo early screening, unless there is clear documentation of an advanced adenoma in a first-degree relative. In most cases the patient has no information regarding whether the family member's adenoma was advanced, and in this case we recommend that it be assumed the adenomas or polyps were not advanced. If a colonoscopy and/or pathology report(s) is available for a family member that documents an advanced adenoma or there is a report of a polyp requiring surgical resection, an advanced adenoma in a family member is considered established. First-degree relatives with advanced adenomas are recommended to be weighted the same as first-degree relatives with CRC (Table 5), and the yield of colonoscopic screening in first-degree relatives of persons with advanced adenomas is substantially increased.

It further states, "This guideline is a strong recommendation, with evidence level III, and GRADE moderate-quality evidence (Table 10)".

### Colorectal cancer screening and surveillance in individuals at increased risk [^0f4a6c0b]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Individuals at increased risk of developing colorectal cancer include those with a personal or family history of advanced adenomas or colorectal cancer, a personal history of inflammatory bowel disease, or genetic polyposis syndromes. In general, these persons should undergo more frequent or earlier testing than individuals at average risk. Individuals who have a first-degree relative with colorectal cancer or advanced adenoma diagnosed before 60 years of age or two first-degree relatives diagnosed at any age should be advised to start screening colonoscopy at 40 years of age or 10 years younger than the earliest diagnosis in their family, whichever comes first. In individuals with ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease with colonic involvement, colonoscopy should begin eight to 10 years after the onset of symptoms and be repeated every one to three years. Individuals who have a first-degree relative with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer should begin colonoscopy at 25 years of age and repeat colonoscopy every one to two years. In persons with a family history of adenomatous polyposis syndromes, screening should begin at 10 years of age or in a person's mid-20s, depending on the syndrome; repeat colonoscopy is typically required every one to two years. Screening colonoscopy should begin at eight years of age in individuals with Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. If results are normal, colonoscopy can be repeated at 18 years of age and then every three years. Persons with sessile serrated adenomatous polyposis should begin annual colonoscopy as soon as the diagnosis is established.

### Does this patient have a family history of cancer? An evidence-based analysis of the accuracy of family cancer history [^30cd20ff]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

A family history of certain cancers is associated with an increased risk of developing cancer. Both cancer screening and genetic services referral decisions are often based on self-reported pedigree information.

Objective

To determine the accuracy of self-reported family cancer history information.

Data Sources

English-language articles were retrieved by searching MEDLINE (1966-June 2004) using Medical Subject Headings family, genetic predisposition to disease, medical history taking, neoplasm, and reproducibility of results. Additional articles were identified through bibliography searches.

Study Selection

Original studies in which investigators validated self-reported family history by reviewing the identified relatives' medical records, death certificate, or cancer registry information were included, as well as studies that evaluated breast, colon, ovarian, endometrial, and prostate cancers.

Data Extraction

Two of the 3 investigators independently reviewed and abstracted data for estimating the likelihood ratios (LRs) of self-reported family cancer history information. Only data from studies that evaluated both positive and negative family cancer histories were included within the analyses. A total of 14 studies met the search criteria and were included in the review.

Data Synthesis

For patients without a personal history of cancer, the positive and negative LRs of a family history of the following cancers in a first-degree relative were 23.0 (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.4–81.0) and 0.25 (95% CI, 0.10–0.63) for colon cancer; 8.9 (95% CI, 5.4–15.0) and 0.20 (95% CI, 0.08–0.49) for breast cancer; 14.0 (95% CI, 2.2–83.4) and 0.68 (95% CI, 0.31–1.52) for endometrial cancer; 34.0 (95% CI, 5.7–202.0) and 0.51 (95% CI, 0.13–2.10) for ovarian cancer; and 12.3 (95% CI, 6.5–24.0) and 0.32 (95% CI, 0.18–0.55) for prostate cancer, respectively. Positive predictive values tended to be better in articles concerning first-degree relatives compared with second-degree relatives.

Conclusions

Patient-reported family cancer histories for first-degree relatives are accurate and valuable for breast and colon cancer risk assessments. Negative family history reports for ovarian and endometrial cancers are less useful, although the prevalence of these malignancies within families is low.

### ACG clinical guidelines: colorectal cancer screening 2021 [^e1e6c277]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guidelines — screening recommendations for family history of colorectal cancer: We suggest initiating CRC screening with a colonoscopy at age 40 or 10 yr before the youngest affected relative, whichever is earlier, for individuals with CRC or advanced polyp in 1 first-degree relative (FDR) at age < 60 yr, or CRC or advanced polyp in ≥ 2 FDR at any age, and we suggest interval colonoscopy every 5 yr. We suggest consideration of genetic evaluation with higher familial CRC burden (higher number and/or younger age of affected relatives). We suggest initiating CRC screening at age 40 or 10 yr before the youngest affected relative and then resuming average-risk screening recommendations for individuals with CRC or advanced polyp in 1 FDR at age ≥ 60 yr. In individuals with 1 second-degree relative (SDR) with CRC or advanced polyp, we suggest following average-risk CRC screening recommendations.

### Incidence and mortality of colorectal cancer in individuals with a family history of colorectal cancer [^2cabbbbc]. Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Little is known about the change in risk conferred by family history of colorectal cancer (CRC) as a person ages. We evaluated the effect of family history on CRC incidence and mortality after 55 years of age, when the risk of early onset cancer had passed.

Methods

We collected data from participants in the randomized, controlled Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian cancer screening trial of flexible sigmoidoscopy versus usual care (55–74 years old, no history of CRC), performed at 10 US centers from 1993 to 2001. A detailed family history of colorectal cancer was obtained at enrollment, and subjects were followed for CRC incidence and mortality for up to 13 years.

Results

Among 144,768 participants, 14,961 subjects (10.3%) reported a family of CRC. Of 2090 incident cases, 273 cases (13.1%) had a family history of CRC; among 538 deaths from CRC, 71 (13.2%) had a family history of CRC. Overall, family history of CRC was associated with an increased risk of CRC incidence (hazard ratio [HR], 1.30; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.10–1.50; P < .0001) and increased mortality (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.02–1.69; P = 0.03). Subjects with 1 first degree relative (FDR) with CRC (n = 238; HR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.07–1.42) or ≥ 2 FDRs with CRC (n = 35; HR, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.44–2.86) were at increased risk for incident CRC. However, among individuals with 1 FDR with CRC, there were no differences in risk based on age at diagnosis in the FDR (for FDR < 60 years of age: HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 0.97–1.63; for FDR 60–70 years of age: HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.06–1.62; for FDR > 70 years of age: HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.93–1.45; P trend = .59).

Conclusions

After 55 years of age, subjects with 1 FDR with CRC had only a modest increase in risk for CRC incidence and death; age of onset in the FDR was not significantly associated with risk. Individuals with ≥ 2 FDRs with CRC had continued increased risk in older age. Guidelines and clinical practice for subjects with a family history of CRC should be modified to align CRC testing to risk. ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00002540.

### Prevention of colorectal cancer by colonoscopic surveillance in individuals with a family history of colorectal cancer: 16 year, prospective, follow-up study [^d024fd90]. BMJ (2005). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine to what extent individuals with various family histories of colorectal cancer (from one to three or more affected first degree relatives) benefit from colonoscopic surveillance.

Design

Prospective, observational study of high risk families, followed up over 16 years.

Setting

Tertiary referral family cancer clinic in London.

Participants

1678 individuals from families registered with the clinic. Individuals were classified according to the strength of their family history: hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (if they fulfilled the Amsterdam criteria), and one, two, or three affected first degree relatives (moderate risk).

Interventions

Colonoscopy was initially offered at five year intervals or three year intervals if an adenoma was detected.

Main Outcome Measures

The incidence of adenomas with high risk pathological features or cancer. This was analysed by age, the extent of the family history, and findings on previous colonoscopies. The cohort was flagged for cancer and death. Incidence of colorectal cancer and mortality during over 15,000 person years of follow-up were compared with those expected in the absence of surveillance.

Results

High risk adenomas and cancer were most common in families with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (on initial colonoscopy 5.7% and 0.9%, respectively). In the families with moderate risk, these findings were particularly uncommon under age 45 (1.1% and 0%) and on follow-up colonoscopy if advanced neoplasia was absent initially (1.7% and 0.1%). The incidence of colorectal cancer was substantially lower-80% in families with moderate risk (P = 0.00004), and 43% in families with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (P = 0.06)-than the expected incidence in the absence of surveillance when the family history was taken into account.

Conclusions

Colonoscopic surveillance reduces the risk of colorectal cancer in people with a strong family history. This study confirms that members of families with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer require surveillance with short intervals. Individuals with a lesser family history may not require surveillance under age 45, and if advanced neoplasia is absent on initial colonoscopy, surveillance intervals may be lengthened. This would reduce the demand for colonoscopic surveillance.

### Cost effectiveness of age-specific screening intervals for people with family histories of colorectal cancer [^299ee339]. Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Relative risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) decreases with age among individuals with a family history of CRC. However, no screening recommendations specify less frequent screening with increasing age. We aimed to determine whether such a refinement would be cost effective.

Methods

We determined the relative risk for CRC for individuals based on age and number of affected first-degree relatives (FDRs) using data from publications. For each number of affected FDRs, we used the Microsimulation Screening Analysis model to estimate costs and effects of colonoscopy screening strategies with different age ranges and intervals. Screening was then optimized sequentially, starting with the youngest age group, and allowing the interval of screening to change at certain ages. Strategies with an incremental cost effectiveness ratio below $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year were considered cost effective.

Results

For people with 1 affected FDR (92% of those with a family history), screening every 3 years beginning at an age of 40 years is most cost effective. If no adenomas are found, the screening interval can gradually be extended to 5 and 7 years, at ages 45 and 55 years, respectively. From a cost-effectiveness perspective, individuals with more affected FDRs should start screening earlier and at shorter intervals. However, frequency can be reduced if no abnormalities are found.

Conclusions

Using a microsimulation model, we found that for individuals with a family history of CRC, it is cost effective to gradually increase the screening interval if several subsequent screening colonoscopies have negative results and no new cases of CRC are found in family members.

### ACG clinical guidelines: colorectal cancer screening 2021 [^37ee6f8b]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

ACG colorectal cancer screening 2021 — family history–based screening recommendations include: We suggest initiating CRC screening with a colonoscopy at age 40 or 10 years before the youngest affected relative, whichever is earlier, for individuals with CRC or advanced polyp in 1 first-degree relative (FDR) age < 60 years or CRC or advanced polyp in ≥ 2 FDR at any age, and we suggest interval colonoscopy every 5 years. We suggest consideration of genetic evaluation with higher familial CRC burden (higher number and/or younger age of affected relatives). We suggest initiating CRC screening at age 40 or 10 years before the youngest affected relative and then resuming average-risk screening recommendations for individuals with CRC or advanced polyp in 1 FDR at age ≥ 60 years. In individuals with 1 second-degree relative (SDR) with CRC or advanced polyp, we suggest following average-risk CRC screening recommendations.

### Screening for colorectal cancer: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^9b6089b1]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Colorectal cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death for both men and women, with an estimated 52 980 persons in the US projected to die of colorectal cancer in 2021. Colorectal cancer is most frequently diagnosed among persons aged 65 to 74 years. It is estimated that 10.5% of new colorectal cancer cases occur in persons younger than 50 years. Incidence of colorectal cancer (specifically adenocarcinoma) in adults aged 40 to 49 years has increased by almost 15% from 2000–2002 to 2014–2016. In 2016, 26% of eligible adults in the US had never been screened for colorectal cancer and in 2018, 31% were not up to date with screening.

Objective

To update its 2016 recommendation, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) commissioned a systematic review to evaluate the benefits and harms of screening for colorectal cancer in adults 40 years or older. The review also examined whether these findings varied by age, sex, or race/ethnicity. In addition, as in 2016, the USPSTF commissioned a report from the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network Colorectal Cancer Working Group to provide information from comparative modeling on how estimated life-years gained, colorectal cancer cases averted, and colorectal cancer deaths averted vary by different starting and stopping ages for various screening strategies.

Population

Asymptomatic adults 45 years or older at average risk of colorectal cancer (ie, no prior diagnosis of colorectal cancer, adenomatous polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease; no personal diagnosis or family history of known genetic disorders that predispose them to a high lifetime risk of colorectal cancer [such as Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis]).

Evidence Assessment

The USPSTF concludes with high certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 50 to 75 years has substantial net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 45 to 49 years has moderate net benefit. The USPSTF concludes with moderate certainty that screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 76 to 85 years who have been previously screened has small net benefit. Adults who have never been screened for colorectal cancer are more likely to benefit.

Recommendation

The USPSTF recommends screening for colorectal cancer in all adults aged 50 to 75 years. (A recommendation) The USPSTF recommends screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 45 to 49 years. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 76 to 85 years. Evidence indicates that the net benefit of screening all persons in this age group is small. In determining whether this service is appropriate in individual cases, patients and clinicians should consider the patient's overall health, prior screening history, and preferences. (C recommendation).

### AGA clinical practice update on risk stratification for colorectal cancer screening and post-polypectomy surveillance: expert review [^899579e6]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Risk categorization by family history and average-risk definition: Individuals with a first-degree relative (FDR; parent, sibling, or child) diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC), particularly before the age of 50 years, should be considered at increased risk for CRC, whereas individuals without a personal history of CRC, inflammatory bowel disease, hereditary CRC syndromes, other CRC predisposing conditions, or a family history of CRC should be considered at average risk. Among average-risk individuals, most CRCs are sporadic with an approximate 4% lifetime risk of being diagnosed with CRC, and approximately 20% of CRCs are associated with familial clustering while approximately 5% are due to predisposing hereditary CRC syndromes.

### The colorectal cancer epidemic: challenges and opportunities for primary, secondary and tertiary prevention [^72d45372]. British Journal of Cancer (2018). Low credibility.

Intriguingly, in the United States, which is the country with the highest reported colonoscopy uptake rate among older adults in the world, CRC incidence and mortality above the age of 50 (the previously recommended starting age for screening colonoscopy in the average risk population) have declined by approximately one-third since the beginning of this century. Similar trends among older adults have also been observed in Germany (Fig. 2), where screening colonoscopy was introduced in 2002 and diagnostic colonoscopies are likewise commonly employed. According to recent estimates, a further reduction by another 30–40% should be possible by more complete adherence to screening offers. By contrast, CRC incidence and mortality continue to increase in younger age groups not covered by screening. No decline in the incidence and mortality of CRC, or potentially even further increases, is seen in many other affluent countries in which effective screening programmes have not been initiated. In response to the increasing CRC incidence below the age of 50, the American Cancer Society recently reduced the recommended age for initiating CRC screening in the average risk population from 50 to 45 years.

Advances in risk-adapted screening

An important aspect of CRC screening is the potential to tailor screening offers depending on individual CRC risk. A positive family history has so far been the only factor recommended for such risk stratification. First-degree relatives of CRC patients are advised to start CRC screening at a younger age than the average risk population, this may be advised from 40 years of age, or at least 10 years before the youngest age at diagnosis of an affected first-degree relative. Recent evidence suggests that such risk stratification could be substantially enhanced in the future through the use of polygenetic risk scores based on emerging results from genome-wide association studies. –

### Colorectal cancer screening: recommendations for physicians and patients from the U.S. multi-society task force on colorectal cancer [^6a58f929]. Gastroenterology (2017). Low credibility.

This document updates the colorectal cancer (CRC) screening recommendations of the U.S. Multi-Society Task Force of Colorectal Cancer (MSTF), which represents the American College of Gastroenterology, the American Gastroenterological Association, and The American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. CRC screening tests are ranked in 3 tiers based on performance features, costs, and practical considerations. The first-tier tests are colonoscopy every 10 years and annual fecal immunochemical test (FIT). Colonoscopy and FIT are recommended as the cornerstones of screening regardless of how screening is offered. Thus, in a sequential approach based on colonoscopy offered first, FIT should be offered to patients who decline colonoscopy. Colonoscopy and FIT are recommended as tests of choice when multiple options are presented as alternatives. A risk-stratified approach is also appropriate, with FIT screening in populations with an estimated low prevalence of advanced neoplasia and colonoscopy screening in high prevalence populations. The second-tier tests include CT colonography every 5 years, the FIT-fecal DNA test every 3 years, and flexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 to 10 years. These tests are appropriate screening tests, but each has disadvantages relative to the tier 1 tests. Because of limited evidence and current obstacles to use, capsule colonoscopy every 5 years is a third-tier test. We suggest that the Septin9 serum assay (Epigenomics, Seattle, Wash) not be used for screening. Screening should begin at age 50 years in average-risk persons, except in African Americans in whom limited evidence supports screening at 45 years. CRC incidence is rising in persons under age 50, and thorough diagnostic evaluation of young persons with suspected colorectal bleeding is recommended. Discontinuation of screening should be considered when persons up to date with screening, who have prior negative screening (particularly colonoscopy), reach age 75 or have < 10 years of life expectancy. Persons without prior screening should be considered for screening up to age 85, depending on age and comorbidities. Persons with a family history of CRC or a documented advanced adenoma in a first-degree relative age < 60 years or 2 first-degree relatives with these findings at any age are recommended to undergo screening by colonoscopy every 5 years, beginning 10 years before the age at diagnosis of the youngest affected relative or age 40, whichever is earlier. Persons with a single first-degree relative diagnosed at ≥ 60 years with CRC or an advanced adenoma can be offered average-risk screening options beginning at age 40 years.

### Family history of colorectal cancer and survival: a Swedish population-based study [^b8a3a5f5]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in the world 1. Survival has been increasing over the years, and prognosis is associated with age at diagnosis, cancer stage, grade as well as treatment in both men and women 2. Evidence indicates there is a heritable component of CRC, which has been previously estimated to be between 15% and 30% 3, 4 with approximately 5% of patients having highly penetrant, hereditary syndromes (e.g. Lynch syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis) 5.

Individuals with an affected first‐degree relative (i.e. positive family history) have a 2‐ to 4‐fold risk of developing cancer compared to individuals with a negative family history 6; however, the association between family history and prognosis is not as well established. There is extensive evidence showing improved survival in patients diagnosed with hereditary nonpolyposis CRC (e.g. Lynch syndrome) due to both surveillance and cancer characteristics 7, 8. Nonetheless, there is mixed evidence for the association between familial risk and survival beyond highly penetrant syndromes. A small number of studies found no association between CRC family history and prognosis 9, 10, 11. Some studies observed worsened 12, 13, whilst others showed improved 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 prognosis amongst patients with a positive (vs. negative) family history. In a few of these studies, the favourable prognosis observed amongst patients with a positive CRC family history appeared to be present for colon but not rectum cancers 15, 17, 19. However, the modifying role of location was not systematically assessed in these studies.

### Hereditary nonpolyposis… [^e6c62102]. AAFP (2018). Low credibility.

First-degree relatives of persons with HNPCC should undergo screening colonoscopy every one to two years starting at 25 years of age or five years younger than the first cancer diagnosis in the family, whichever comes first. 6 Surveillance should continue until 75 years of age. 6 Some families with a history of HNPCC are at increased risk of developing gastric cancer. In such families, biennial upper endoscopy should start at 50 years of age or five years younger than the age of the youngest affected relative with gastric cancer, whichever is earlier, and should continue until 75 years of age. 4 If a genetic mutation has been found, flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy should be performed annually. 6 If genetic testing has not yet been performed or is negative, annual screening should be performed until 24 years of age, then every two years until 34 years of age, then every three years until 44 years of age, and every three to five years thereafter.

6 First-degree relatives of patients with familial adenomatous polyposis in whom a mutation has not been found should undergo colonoscopy, 4 and upper endoscopy for gastric cancer and proximal small bowel tumors starting at 20 to 25 years of age. 5 Additional screening may include annual thyroid examination on physical examination and possibly ultrasonography to screen for malignancy and upper endoscopy for gastric cancer and proximal small bowel tumors starting at 20 to 25 years of age. 5 This applies to all adenomatous polyposis syndromes. 9 CRC presents in patients with MUTYH-associated polyposis between 50 to 70 years of age with a 100% lifetime risk of CRC. 9 Colonoscopy should begin in the late teens to mid 20s, with colonoscopy every one to two years. 6 The timing of surgery should be individualized, but if polyps become endoscopically uncontrollable, then colectomy is indicated.

4 Upper endoscopy to screen for gastric and duodenal polyps should be offered starting between 20 and 25 years of age and then every one to five years. 9, 14. 4 If no polyps are identified, EGD and colonoscopy should be repeated at 18 years of age and every three years thereafter. 4 The goal of treatment is the removal of all polyps; however, this is not always achievable, and colectomy may be necessary in some patients.

### AGA clinical practice update on risk stratification for colorectal cancer screening and post-polypectomy surveillance: expert review [^3eac615a]. Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Description

Since the early 2000s, there has been a rapid decline in colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality, due in large part to screening and removal of precancerous polyps. Despite these improvements, CRC remains the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States, with approximately 53,000 deaths projected in 2023. The aim of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Clinical Practice Update Expert Review was to describe how individuals should be risk-stratified for CRC screening and post-polypectomy surveillance and to highlight opportunities for future research to fill gaps in the existing literature.

Methods

This Expert Review was commissioned and approved by the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership, and underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through standard procedures of Gastroenterology. These Best Practice Advice statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and from expert opinion. Because systematic reviews were not performed, these Best Practice Advice statements do not carry formal ratings regarding the quality of evidence or strength of the presented considerations. Best Practice Advice Statements BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 1: All individuals with a first-degree relative (defined as a parent, sibling, or child) who was diagnosed with CRC, particularly before the age of 50 years, should be considered at increased risk for CRC. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 2: All individuals without a personal history of CRC, inflammatory bowel disease, hereditary CRC syndromes, other CRC predisposing conditions, or a family history of CRC should be considered at average risk for CRC. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 3: Individuals at average risk for CRC should initiate screening at age 45 years and individuals at increased risk for CRC due to having a first-degree relative with CRC should initiate screening 10 years before the age at diagnosis of the youngest affected relative or age 40 years, whichever is earlier. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 4: Risk stratification for initiation of CRC screening should be based on an individual's age, a known or suspected predisposing hereditary CRC syndrome, and/or a family history of CRC. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 5: The decision to continue CRC screening in individuals older than 75 years should be individualized, based on an assessment of risks, benefits, screening history, and comorbidities. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 6: Screening options for individuals at average risk for CRC should include colonoscopy, fecal immunochemical test, flexible sigmoidoscopy plus fecal immunochemical test, multitarget stool DNA fecal immunochemical test, and computed tomography colonography, based on availability and individual preference. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 7: Colonoscopy should be the screening strategy used for individuals at increased CRC risk. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 8: The decision to continue post-polypectomy surveillance for individuals older than 75 years should be individualized, based on an assessment of risks, benefits, and comorbidities. BEST PRACTICE ADVICE 9: Risk-stratification tools for CRC screening and post-polypectomy surveillance that emerge from research should be examined for real-world effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in diverse populations (eg, by race, ethnicity, sex, and other sociodemographic factors associated with disparities in CRC outcomes) before widespread implementation.

### Final recommendation statement: colorectal cancer: screening [^5c5812ee]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Figure 1. Clinician Summary: Screening for Colorectal Cancer

What does the USPSTF recommend?

For adults aged 50 to 75 years:

- Screen all adults aged 50 to 75 years for colorectal cancer. Grade A

For adults aged 45 to 49 years:

- Screen adults aged 45 to 49 years for colorectal cancer. Grade B

For adults aged 76 to 85 years:

- Selectively screen adults aged 76 to 85 years for colorectal cancer, considering the patient's overall health, prior screening history, and patient's preferences. Grade C

To whom does this recommendation apply?

Adults 45 years or older who do not have signs or symptoms of colorectal cancer and who are at average risk for colorectal cancer (ie, no prior diagnosis of colorectal cancer, adenomatous polyps, or inflammatory bowel disease; no personal diagnosis or family history of known genetic disorders that predispose them to a high lifetime risk of colorectal cancer [such as Lynch syndrome or familial adenomatous polyposis]).

What's new?

The USPSTF expanded the recommended ages for colorectal cancer screening to 45 to 75 years (previously, it was 50 to 75 years). The USPSTF continues to recommend selectively screening adults aged 76 to 85 years for colorectal cancer.

### Colonic adenoma risk in familial colorectal cancer – a study of six extended kindreds [^fa398cce]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

Most colorectal cancers (CRCs) arise from adenomatous polyps, but the effects of CRC family history on adenoma risk are not well known. This issue is clinically relevant since several medical societies currently recommend earlier and more rigorous colorectal screening for individuals with a strong family history of CRC.

Methods

Colonoscopies were performed in 236 first-, second-, and third-degree relatives of 40 index CRC cases from six large kindreds selected from a large population database. The kindreds were selected for significantly greater risk of CRCs compared with the overall population. Known hereditary colon cancer syndromes were clinically and genetically excluded.

Results

Thirty-seven percent of relatives were found to have adenomas on colonoscopy. The average age of diagnosis for colon cancer was 63 yr and advanced adenomas 56 yr. Independent predictors of adenomatous polyps in the relatives were advancing age (P < 0.0001), male gender (P < 0.001), and greater degree of relation to CRC cases (P < 0.01). There was no significant predilection of colorectal tumors for the right or left colon. A higher degree of relationship to CRC cases was a significant predictor of having simple and advanced adenomas, but not hyperplastic polyps after adjustment for age and gender.

Conclusions

These data support the current recommendations for colonoscopy starting before the age of 50 yr in individuals with a strong family history of CRC.

### Risk of colorectal cancer in first degree relatives of patients with colorectal polyps: nationwide case-control study in Sweden [^69958126]. BMJ (2021). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths worldwide. Endoscopic screening reduces the incidence of and mortality from CRC by reoval of precursor lesions, namely colorectal polyps. Identifying high risk individuals for tailored screening has important public health and economic implications for improving the prevention of CRC. In contrast with the established increased risk associated with a family history of CRC, it remains unclear whether those with a family history of colorectal polyps have an increased risk of CRC. As a result, available screening recommendations are discrepant for individuals with a family history of polyps. The US Multi-Society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer recommends earlier screening in people with a family history of advanced polyps in the same manner as for those with a family history of CRC, whereas the British Society of Gastroenterology only considers family history of CRC but not polyps in screening recommendations. Given the higher prevalence of polyps than CRC associated with the increasing uptake of endoscopic screening, a better understanding about the influence of family history of polyps on CRC risk is critical to improve current screening recommendations.

Existing data on the association between family history of colorectal polyps and CRC risk are inconclusive. Whereas some studies reported an increased risk of CRC in first degree relatives of patients with a history of colorectal polyps, others indicated that the risk varied by polyp type and was restricted to large or advanced adenomas. Moreover, these studies had limited ability to inform screening recommendations owing to several limitations. Firstly, the most important unanswered question is whether the first degree relatives of someone with a colorectal polyp are still at greater risk of CRC after adjusting for family history of CRC. If the risk of CRC is increased, the next question is whether the first degree relatives of individuals with polyps are specifically at risk of early onset CRC that develops before the age of 50 years, the commonly recommended age for starting CRC screening in adults at average risk. This is a particularly important question because of the global increase in the incidence of early onset CRC. In addition, previous studies have focused on conventional adenomas only, and the influence of family history of serrated polyps, a newly recognised precursor lesion for CRC, remains to be determined. Finally, past studies were limited by small sample size (< 300 participants with CRC), cross sectional design, and reliance on self-reported family history data.

In our nationwide case-control study, we used information from several national registers in Sweden to assess the relation between family history of colorectal polyps and risk of CRC.

### Prevalence of a first-degree relative with colorectal cancer and uptake of screening among persons 40 to 54 years old [^b56d1a62]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

People with a first-degree relative with colorectal cancer (CRC) are recommended to start CRC screening at age 40. However, there is limited information on how many people in different age groups have a known family history of CRC and how many of them have had a colonoscopy.

Methods

We set up a multicenter, cross-sectional, population-based study in Germany to determine what proportions of persons in age groups from 40 to 54 years old have a known family history of CRC. We invited 160,000 persons to participate in an online survey from 2015 through 2016. We investigated what proportions of persons in each age group reported a family history of CRC and what proportions of persons underwent a colonoscopy examination using descriptive statistics and multiple logistic regression models.

Results

Of 28,711 responders to the online questionnaire (8428 were age 40–44 years, 9879 were age 45–49 years, and 10,404 were age 50–54 years), 2705 stated that they had a first-degree relative with CRC (9.4%). The prevalence of a first-degree relative with CRC increased with age: 7.5%, 9.6%, and 10.9% for people 40 to 44 years old, 45 to 49 years old, and 50 to 54 years old, respectively. The prevalence of a first-degree relative who received a diagnosis of CRC at age 70 years or older increased steadily with each age group. Although a greater proportion of people with a family history of CRC had undergone a colonoscopy examination (54.5%) than people without a family history of CRC (25.7%; P < .0001), large proportions of people within this risk group were not in compliance with the guidelines (54.8%, 47.6%, and 38.6% for ages 40–44 y, 45–49 y, and 50–54 y, respectively).

Conclusions

One in 10 persons in Germany age 40 to 54 years old has a first-degree relative with CRC. Guidelines recommend initiation of screening at ages 40 to 45 years for people with a family history, yet at this age many people do not have a family history of CRC yet, and almost half of persons 40 to 54 years old with a family history of CRC have not yet received a screening colonoscopy.

Colorectal cancer risk assessment tool — screening questions to identify individuals needing genetic evaluation ask: "Do you have a first-degree relative (mother, father, brother, sister, or child) with any of the following conditions diagnosed before age 50?" including "Colon or rectal cancer" or "Cancer of the uterus, ovary, stomach, small intestine, urinary tract (kidney, ureter, bladder), bile ducts, pancreas, or brain"; "Have you had any of the following conditions diagnosed before age 50:" such as "Colon or rectal cancer" or "Colon or rectal polyps"; and "Do you have three or more relatives with a history of colon or rectal cancer? (This includes parents, brothers, sisters, children, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins.)" An affirmative response triggers the pathway "Yes to any question… Refer for additional assessment or genetic evaluation".

### Impact of patient age on family cancer history [^75535d30]. Genetics in Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

Younger individuals with relatives diagnosed with cancer are at greater risk for developing certain cancer when compared with older individuals with affected relatives. The purpose of this study was to calculate the age-specific proportion of individuals reporting positive family histories for colon, breast, and prostate cancer.

Methods

Family cancer history information was reviewed on 32,374 adults interviewed for the 2000 National Health Interview Survey. Family histories were categorized as high risk, with a relative diagnosed before 50 years of age or with multiple affected relatives, or moderate risk, with a single relative diagnosed at age 50 years or older.

Results

For individuals with a family history of colorectal cancer, the odds of having a high-risk pedigree decreased by 1% (95% confidence interval 0%-2%) for every year of age increase. For women reporting a family breast cancer history, the odds of reporting a pedigree with high-risk features decreased by 3% (95% confidence interval 2%-4%) for each year of age increase. Age was not associated with reporting a high-risk pedigree for prostate cancer.

Conclusion

For colorectal and breast cancers, younger individuals reporting a family history of these cancers were more likely to report a pedigree with high-risk features than older individuals.

### Personalized initial screening age for colorectal cancer in individuals at average risk [^43253b5d]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

How can risk variation in individuals without a family history of colorectal cancer (CRC) be translated into personalized starting ages of screening?

Findings

In this cohort study of 242 779 participants with no previous screening for and no family history of CRC, derivation of risk-adapted starting ages of screening used 2 major CRC risk indicators, sex and a polygenic risk score (PRS), based on the risk advancement period concept. Risk-adapted starting ages varied by as much as 24 years between men in the highest PRS decile and women in the lowest PRS decile, even among individuals at average risk.

Meaning

These findings suggest that the risk advancement period approach enables derivation of starting ages of screening according to risk factor profiles from large-scale cohort studies, which vary greatly even within individuals at average risk.

### Early initiation of colorectal cancer screening in individuals with affected first-degree relatives [^5e707fc7]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Several guidelines recommend initiating colorectal cancer screening at age 40 for individuals with affected first-degree relatives, yet little evidence exists describing how often these individuals receive screening procedures.

Objectives

To determine the proportion of individuals in whom early initiation of colorectal cancer screening might be indicated and whether screening disparities exist.

Design

Population-based Supplemental Cancer Control Module to the 2000 National Health Interview Survey.

Participants

Respondents, 5,564, aged 40 to 49 years were included within the analysis.

Measurements

Patient self-report of sigmoidoscopy, colonoscopy, or fecal occult blood test.

Results

Overall, 279 respondents (5.4%: 95% C. I., 4.7, 6.2) reported having a first-degree relative affected with colorectal cancer. For individuals with a positive family history, 67 whites (27.9%: 95% C. I., 21.1, 34.5) and 3 African American (9.3%: 95% C. I., 1.7, 37.9) had undergone an endoscopic procedure within the previous 10 years (P-value = .03). After adjusting for age, family history, gender, educational level, insurance status, and usual source of care, whites were more likely to be current with early initiation endoscopic screening recommendations than African Americans (OR = 1.38: 95% C. I., 1.01, 1.87). Having an affected first-degree relative with colorectal cancer appeared to have a stronger impact on endoscopic screening for whites (OR = 3.21: 95% C. I., 2.31, 4.46) than for African Americans (OR = 1.05: 95% C. I., 0.15, 7.21).

Conclusions

White participants with a family history are more likely to have endoscopic procedures beginning before age 50 than African Americans.

### Final recommendation statement: colorectal cancer: screening [^45b5349c]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

Recommendations of Others

Many organizations have issued guidelines on screening for colorectal cancer. There is a general consensus that average-risk adults aged 50 to 75 years should be screened. The American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP), American College of Physicians (ACP), American Cancer Society (ACS), and the US Multi-Society Task Force (which includes the American College of Gastroenterology, American Gastroenterological Association, and American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy) all recommend routine colorectal cancer screening in this age group, although specific recommended tests and frequency of screening may vary. Currently, where recommendations and guidelines vary is the age to initiate screening. In 2017, the US Multi-Society Task Force recommended beginning screening at age 45 years in Black adults (weak recommendation) and screening at age 40 years (or 10 years before the age at diagnosis of a family member, whichever is earlier) in persons with a family history for colorectal cancer. In 2018, the ACS recommended that screening begin at age 45 years in all adults (qualified recommendation). The AAFP's recommendations do not address screening before age 50 years. In 2021, the American College of Gastroenterology suggested screening in average-risk persons aged 45 to 49 years (conditional recommendation) and recommended screening average-risk persons aged 50 to 75 years (strong recommendation).

Generally, guidelines agree that screening should either be individualized in older adults aged 76 to 85 years (ACS, AAFP, and US Multi-Society Task Force) or stopped altogether (ACP), with clear consensus that screening should stop after age 85 years.

Colorectal cancer risk assessment tool — patients who answer yes to any question should have more comprehensive family history evaluation; questions include: whether a first-degree relative (mother, father, brother, sister, or child) had colon or rectal cancer or cancer of the uterus, ovary, stomach, small intestine, urinary tract (kidney, ureter, bladder), bile ducts, pancreas, or brain diagnosed before age 50; whether the patient had colon or rectal cancer or colon or rectal polyps diagnosed before age 50 years; and whether the patient has three or more relatives with a history of colon or rectal cancer, including parents, brothers, sisters, children, grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins.

### Delphi initiative for early-onset colorectal cancer (DIRECt) international management guidelines [^2d456df2]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). Medium credibility.

R.1: Comment.

Family history of cancer should include all cancer diagnoses to identify hereditary syndromes (implicated in 13% of eoCRC), as well as to quantify risk for non-syndromic familial CRC. About 28% of patients with eoCRC have a family history of CRC, which is not significantly different compared with the loCRC population. Individuals with a family history of CRC should undergo more intensive surveillance than the general population, starting at an earlier age. However, definitions of who should undergo more intensive surveillance vary widely by country. There is a consensus that having at least 2 first-degree relatives with CRC and/or at least 1 first-degree relative diagnosed with CRC before the age of 50–60 years are associated with a significant increase in risk for CRC. In these situations, screening colonoscopy starting at 40 years (or 10 years before the age at diagnosis of the youngest affected relative) is usually recommended. A recent study showed that up to 16% of eoCRC could be preventedif colonoscopy was performed at the age recommended by guidelines based on family history.–

Validated risk assessment tools can facilitate family history taking and identification of patients who would benefit from germline genetic testing, such as the Colon Cancer Risk Assessment Tool and the PREMM 5.000000000000000e+00, The PREMM 5 tool can be used to determine the likelihood of a pathogenic variant (PV)/likely pathogenic variant (LPV) in a Lynch syndrome (LS) gene. However, it is recommended that all patients with eoCRC should undergo multigene germline panel testing, regardless of the results of risk assessment tools (see G.1).

The systematic review found 6 studies evaluating the prevalence of a family history of CRC among individuals with eoCRC, 3 of whom had LE 2b, and they all concluded that there was a strong predisposition for having a family history of CRC among younger patients. Five studies evaluated the clinical outcomes of taking family histories, with 2 studies having LE 1a, and they all concluded that a family history of CRC increases the risk of eoCRC.

### Use of family history and genetic testing to determine risk of colorectal cancer [^4626e3fb]. Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Approximately 35% of patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) have a family history of the disease attributed to genetic factors, common exposures, or both. Some families with a history of CRC carry genetic variants that cause CRC with high or moderate penetrance, but these account for only 5% to 10% of CRC cases. Most families with a history of CRC and/or adenomas do not carry genetic variants associated with cancer syndromes; this is called common familial CRC. Our understanding of familial predisposition to CRC and cancer syndromes has increased rapidly due to advances in next-generation sequencing technologies. As a result, there has been a shift from genetic testing for specific inherited cancer syndromes based on clinical criteria alone, to simultaneous testing of multiple genes for cancer-associated variants. We summarize current knowledge of common familial CRC, provide an update on syndromes associated with CRC (including the nonpolyposis and polyposis types), and review current recommendations for CRC screening and surveillance. We also provide an approach to genetic evaluation and testing in clinical practice. Determination of CRC risk based on family cancer history and results of genetic testing can provide a personalized approach to cancer screening and prevention, with optimal use of colonoscopy to effectively decrease CRC incidence and mortality.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for colon cancer, more specifically with respect to indications for screening, general population, aged 76–85 years, ACS 2018 guidelines recommend to continue CRC screening through the age of 75 years in average-risk individuals in good health with a life expectancy of > 10 years continue.

### Cancer screening in the older patient [^35dfc576]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Although there are clear guidelines that advise at what age to begin screening for various cancers, there is less guidance concerning when it may be appropriate to stop screening. The decision to stop screening must take into account patients' age; overall health and life expectancy; the natural history of the disease; and the risks, expense, and convenience of the screening test, and any subsequent testing and treatment. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the American Academy of Family Physicians suggest that Papanicolaou smears can be discontinued in women at 65 years of age, provided they have had adequate recent normal screenings. Evidence suggests that cessation of breast cancer screening at approximately 75 to 80 years of age is appropriate, although American Geriatric Society guidelines recommend cessation at a more advanced age. Studies support continuing colon cancer screening until approximately 75 years of age in men and 80 years of age in women for patients without significant comorbidities. Prostate cancer screening, if conducted at all, may be discontinued at approximately 75 years of age in otherwise healthy men. Ultimately, the decision to screen or to discontinue screening must be made after careful discussion with each patient, using evidence-based guidelines and individual patient preferences.

Age to stop screening for colorectal cancer in average-risk adults — Guidance Statement 3 states that clinicians should stop screening for colorectal cancer in asymptomatic average-risk adults older than 75 years or in asymptomatic average-risk adults with a life expectancy of 10 years or less, noting there is no new evidence from randomized controlled trials for those older than 75 or with limited life expectancy. The document adds that persons older than 75 years who are in good health and lack history of colorectal cancer screening may still derive a net benefit from 1-time screening, and cites external guidance that the USPSTF recommends selectively screening average-risk adults aged 76 to 85 years and that the ACS recommends individualized decisions for adults aged 76 through 85 years and to discourage adults aged 85 years from continuing screening.

### Updates on age to start and stop colorectal cancer screening: recommendations from the U.S. multi-society task force on colorectal cancer [^656e9237]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Summary of professional society recommendations on when to start and when to stop CRC screening — American Cancer Society, 2018: "The ACS recommends that adults aged 45 and older with an average risk of CRC undergo regular screening with either a high-sensitivity stool-based test or a structural (visual) examination, depending on patient preference and test availability. As a part of the screening process, all positive results on non-colonoscopy screening tests should be followed up with timely colonoscopy". ACS clarifies, "The recommendation to begin screening at age 45 is a qualified recommendation". and "The recommendation for regular screening in adults aged 50 y and older is a strong recommendation". For stopping, ACS states, "Average-risk adults in good health with a life expectancy of greater than 10 years continue CRC screening through the age of 75 years (qualified recommendation)". and that clinicians should "individualize CRC screening decisions for individuals aged 76 through 85 years based on patient preferences, life expectancy, health status, and prior screening history (qualified recommendation)". and should "discourage" individuals "over age 85 years" from continuing screening (qualified recommendation).

### Colorectal cancer mortality in first-degree relatives of early-onset colorectal cancer cases [^2d40f4ad]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2002). Low credibility.

Purpose

Estimates of familial colorectal cancer risks are useful in genetic counseling and as a guide to determining entry into screening programs and trials of chemoprevention. Furthermore, they provide an insight into the contribution of the known colorectal cancer genes to the familial risk of the disease. There is a paucity of data about the familial colorectal cancer risk associated with early-onset disease outside the recognized cancer predisposition syndromes.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study. The parents and siblings of 205 patients with colorectal cancer aged less than 55 years at diagnosis were studied for mortality and cancer incidence.

Results

The overall standardized mortality ratio of colorectal cancer compared with the Northern Irish population was 3.54 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.59–4.79). There was some evidence that a family history of colorectal cancer is associated with a greater risk of colon (4.16; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.83–5.91) rather than rectal cancer (2.62; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.43–4.40). Risks in parents (2.54; 95 percent confidence interval, 1.45–3.72) were lower than in siblings (6.15; 95 percent confidence interval, 3.90–9.23).

Conclusion

First-degree relatives of patients with early-onset disease are at a marked increase in risk. There is evidence that risks vary depending on the type of affected relative and by the site of colorectal cancer. This information should be considered in formulating screening strategies.

### Colorectal cancer incidence trends in younger versus older adults: an analysis of population-based cancer registry data [^e1c5ea8b]. The Lancet: Oncology (2025). High credibility.

The concurrent increases in colorectal cancer in both age groups in Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean might also partially reflect limited screening capacity or suboptimal uptake (eg, Japan), which could have altered the increase of colorectal cancer in older adults if adequate screening had been performed. Coupled with the stagnation in reducing colorectal cancer incidence among older adults, the simultaneous rise in colorectal cancer among younger adults and the inadequate access to appropriate treatment in many countries in these regions is likely to lead to an increase in colorectal cancer-related deaths, as projected in a previous study, underscoring the urgent need to increase awareness of the concerning trends across age groups.

To curb the rise in early-onset colorectal cancer, the American Cancer Society lowered the recommended starting age for colorectal cancer screening from 50 years to 45 years for average-risk individuals in 2018, and the US Preventive Services Task Force followed suit in 2021. As of July 1, 2024, the eligible age for the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program in Australia was lowered from 50 years to 45 years. Expanding average-risk screening to younger ages, however, remains controversial, even in high-resource settings, due to the low absolute incidence of early-onset colorectal cancer and concerns about diverting screening capacity from older adults or high-risk individuals who would benefit more at a lower cost. In countries adopting lowering screening ages, challenges remain in achieving optimal screening prevalence and ensuring equitable access to all eligible populations, as well as determining the effectiveness of screening based on empirical data. With the absence of screening tools, most early-onset colorectal cancers are diagnosed through symptoms often at an advanced stage and more frequently in the distal colon (right-sided) and rectum. Thus improving awareness among health-care providers and the public about the signs and symptoms of early-onset colorectal cancer (eg, rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, altered bowel habits, and unexplained weight loss) remains a primary opportunity for early detection. Additionally, prioritising the collection of family cancer history can be a key strategy for identifying individuals at higher risk for early-onset colorectal cancer, especially among siblings and relatives of those with early-onset colorectal cancer. A study estimated that half of early-onset colorectal cancer would be diagnosed earlier and up to 16% potentially preventedif colonoscopy was performed at the age recommended by family history-informed guidelines.

### Family history of colon cancer: what does it mean and how is it useful? [^17ba53e2]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Family history of colon cancer can be deconstructed into causal and noncausal explanations, which include genetic factors, environmental factors, gene-environment interactions, misclassification, and differences in screening.

Methods

We investigated some of these causal and noncausal explanations by using data from a case-control study of colon cancer conducted among African Americans and whites in North Carolina. We examined the relationship between family history and polymorphisms in four genes (N-acetyltransferase 1 and 2 [NAT1, NAT2], methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma [PPARG]), environmental risk factors, the joint distributions of these genes and environmental risk factors, and the prevalence of colon cancer screening.

Results

Participants with one or more first-degree relatives with colon cancer showed a slightly higher prevalence of at-risk genotypes for each locus, but results were statistically significant only for NAT2. Participants with a family history showed a higher prevalence of at-risk combinations of genotypes and environmental risk factors (NAT2 and well-done red meat consumption; PPARG and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication use). The sensitivity and predictive value of family history for identifying persons with at-risk genotypes or environmental risk factors was low. History of cancer screening was similar in those with and without a family history.

Conclusions

Our results suggest that family history of colon cancer may represent aggregation of some genetic polymorphisms and environmental risk factors. Although it is premature to use family history as a screening tool when testing for genetic polymorphisms, further research is needed to identify additional genes and environmental factors that may be associated with family history.

### Anxieties should not be forgotten when screening relatives of colorectal cancer patients by colonoscopy [^3bca3c6f]. Colorectal Disease (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Individuals with a strong family history have a high risk of developing colorectal cancer. They could well benefit from targeted screening and their increased risk warrants an invasive procedure such as colonoscopy. This study aims to assess the anxieties of symptom-free relatives offered screening by colonoscopy.

Method

A simple questionnaire was sent to 50 consecutive people who had colorectal cancer screening by colonoscopy because of a strong family history.

Results

Forty-five questionnaires were answered. On assessing their anxiety levels before and after colonoscopy, 56% noticed an improvement after the test, 33% were still as anxious and 11% had raised anxiety levels despite screening. Although most of the screening colonoscopies were normal, 44% of asymptomatic relatives undergoing invasive screening had no improvement of their cancer anxieties.

Conclusion

Screening people with a strong family history of colorectal cancer may be an efficient, cost-effective and focussed way of detecting early neoplasms rather than screening the general population. Using colonoscopy alone however, a large proportion of people still have cancer anxieties after being screened. This small study suggests that in order to attempt to alleviate anxieties, a colonoscopy alone is insufficient for some in this high-risk group.

### Final recommendation statement: colorectal cancer: screening [^b071cebc]. JAMA (2021). Excellent credibility.

RECOMMENDATION

The USPSTF recommends screening for colorectal cancer in all adults aged 50 to 75 years. (A recommendation) The USPSTF recommends screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 45 to 49 years. (B recommendation) The USPSTF recommends that clinicians selectively offer screening for colorectal cancer in adults aged 76 to 85 years. Evidence indicates that the net benefit of screening all persons in this age group is small. In determining whether this service is appropriate in individual cases, patients and clinicians should consider the patient's overall health, prior screening history, and preferences. (C recommendation)
