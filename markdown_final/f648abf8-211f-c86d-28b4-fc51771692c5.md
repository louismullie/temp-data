## Question

How do you treat patients with WPW and atrial fibrillation

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome and atrial fibrillation (AF). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and hemodynamic assessment. Then, I should verify which medications are contraindicated and why. Next, I will consider pharmacologic options for stable patients, followed by indications for synchronized cardioversion. After that, I need to plan for definitive therapy with catheter ablation and risk stratification. Finally, I should address special populations, long-term management, and summarize a practical algorithm with key takeaways anchored to guidelines and pivotal studies.

> Let me first confirm the clinical scenario and its risk profile. WPW with AF is a pre-excited AF in which atrial impulses conduct anterogradely over the accessory pathway, producing very rapid, irregular wide-complex tachycardia with risk of degeneration to ventricular fibrillation, particularly when the accessory pathway has a short refractory period, so I need to act promptly and avoid therapies that slow the AV node while sparing the pathway [^8f491660] [^4cbeea18].

> I will now examine hemodynamic stability because this dictates everything in the first hour. If the patient is unstable with hypotension, shock, ischemia, or altered mentation, I should not delay — immediate synchronized direct-current cardioversion is indicated to prevent VF and circulatory collapse, and I should remember to synchronize to avoid R-on-T VF induction in this irregular rhythm [^31f5060f] [^0eef61c6].

> Wait, let me verify medication contraindications before I consider drugs. AV nodal blockers such as beta-blockers, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, digoxin, and adenosine are contraindicated in pre-excited AF because they can paradoxically accelerate ventricular response via the accessory pathway and precipitate hemodynamic collapse or VF; I should also avoid amiodarone in this setting given contemporary guidance, even though older sources sometimes listed it as an option, so I need to be explicit about this change [^31f5060f] [^48b066c4] [^c901b061] [^298beddc].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about adenosine. I initially thought adenosine might be acceptable because it is effective for PSVT, but wait, I should double-check its role in AF — adenosine is not effective for converting AF and is contraindicated in pre-excited AF because it blocks the AV node and can worsen pre-excitation, so I must not give it here [^34b65abd] [^31f5060f].

> For hemodynamically stable patients, I need to ensure I choose agents that slow conduction over the accessory pathway. Intravenous procainamide, ibutilide, flecainide, or propafenone are recommended options to prolong the accessory pathway refractory period and reduce pre-excited ventricular rates; I should monitor closely for QT prolongation and proarrhythmia, and be prepared to cardiovert if deterioration occurs [^7c6aa0ba] [^31f5060f].

> Let me consider alternatives when standard agents are unavailable or contraindicated. Nifekalant, a pure class III antiarrhythmic, has shown efficacy in prolonging accessory pathway refractory period and slowing pre-excited ventricular response without blocking the AV node, with a low torsades risk when potassium and rhythm are monitored; it may be particularly useful when left ventricular function is impaired, though I should confirm local availability and experience before using it [^c7636cab] [^fcbc07a0].

> Next, I should review when to escalate to synchronized cardioversion even in stable patients. If pharmacologic therapy fails to control the rhythm or the patient deteriorates, synchronized cardioversion is indicated; I need to ensure sedation and appropriate pads/paddle placement, and I should remember that for AF > 48 hours without anticoagulation, thromboembolic risk must be weighed and anticoagulation strategy planned if conversion is pursued [^5bbdd6d9] [^b00ef147].

> I will now examine definitive therapy because acute management is not enough. Catheter ablation of the accessory pathway is the treatment of choice to eliminate the substrate for pre-excited AF and prevent recurrence; success rates exceed 95% in experienced hands, and ablation is recommended particularly for symptomatic patients, those with high-risk features, or when AF recurs despite medical therapy [^31f5060f] [^8f491660].

> But wait, what if the patient is asymptomatic or the pathway appears "low risk"? I should confirm risk stratification criteria. High-risk features include shortest pre-excited R-R interval ≤ 250 ms during AF, accessory pathway effective refractory period ≤ 250 ms, multiple accessory pathways, or inducible AVRT triggering AF; patients with these features should be offered ablation after discussing risks, especially AV block with septal pathways, whereas low-risk patients may be observed with shared decision-making [^e8b0d2f1] [^32ea7f1e] [^486b7bbd].

> Let me think about special populations. In children and adolescents, even asymptomatic patients can be at meaningful risk, and prophylactic ablation reduces arrhythmic events in high-risk pediatric cohorts; in adults with congenital heart disease, ablation success may be lower and recurrence higher, so I should involve experienced centers and consider surgical ablation if catheter-based therapy fails or anatomy is unfavorable [^76d76efa] [^3490581c] [^4c4ac3a0].

> I should confirm long-term AF management after accessory pathway ablation. Even after successful AP ablation, AF can recur in a minority, particularly with advanced interatrial block or age > 50 years; in carefully selected high-risk subgroups, adding pulmonary vein isolation at the time of AP ablation may reduce recurrence, though routine PVI for all is not supported, so I need to individualize based on ECG markers and clinical risk [^de2aea2c] [^0c7fc3aa] [^c58d59ae].

> Next, I should review anticoagulation strategy. If AF is ongoing or cardioversion is planned, I must follow standard AF anticoagulation principles based on duration of AF and CHA2DS2-VASc risk, balancing stroke prevention against bleeding risk; this is especially critical when AF has persisted beyond 48 hours or when the exact duration is unknown [^b00ef147].

> Let me reconsider the practical algorithm to ensure nothing is missing. Stabilize and assess hemodynamics; if unstable, immediate synchronized cardioversion. If stable, avoid AV nodal blockers and give a pathway-active agent such as procainamide, ibutilide, flecainide, or propafenone, with close monitoring and readiness to cardiovert. If drugs fail or the patient worsens, proceed to synchronized cardioversion. Once stabilized, arrange electrophysiology referral for accessory pathway ablation and risk stratify for recurrence risk and adjunctive PVI in selected patients [^31f5060f] [^7c6aa0ba] [^5bbdd6d9].

> Key takeaway, and I should double-check that I am aligned with guidelines: never use AV nodal blockers or adenosine in pre-excited AF, prioritize synchronized cardioversion for instability, use procainamide, ibutilide, flecainide, or propafenone for stable patients, and pursue catheter ablation of the accessory pathway as definitive therapy to prevent recurrence and mitigate sudden death risk in appropriate candidates [^31f5060f] [^7c6aa0ba] [^8f491660].

Treat WPW with AF by **immediate synchronized cardioversion** if unstable [^31f5060f], and use **IV procainamide or ibutilide** [^7c6aa0ba] if stable. Avoid **AV nodal blockers** (beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, adenosine, amiodarone) [^31f5060f] because they can accelerate ventricular response and precipitate VF [^c901b061]. Definitive therapy is **catheter ablation** of the accessory pathway [^8f491660], which is first-line for symptomatic patients or those with high-risk features [^32ea7f1e]. Anticoagulation is guided by standard AF protocols based on CHA₂DS₂-VASc [^b00ef147].

---

## Acute management

### Hemodynamically unstable patients

For hemodynamically unstable patients, **immediate synchronized cardioversion** is indicated [^31f5060f] [^5bbdd6d9].

---

### Hemodynamically stable patients

- **Pharmacologic rhythm control**: IV procainamide or ibutilide are first-line to slow conduction over the accessory pathway and restore sinus rhythm [^7c6aa0ba] [^31f5060f].

- **Avoid AV nodal blockers**: Beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, adenosine, and amiodarone are contraindicated because they may accelerate ventricular response and precipitate VF [^31f5060f] [^c901b061] [^298beddc].

- **Electrical cardioversion**: Use if drug therapy fails or instability develops [^5bbdd6d9].

---

## Definitive therapy

Catheter ablation of the accessory pathway is **first-line definitive therapy** [^8f491660], with success rates > 95% and low complication rates [^1b4c94bf]. It is recommended for symptomatic patients, those with high-risk features (e.g. shortest pre-excited R-R interval ≤ 250 ms) [^e8b0d2f1], or when AF recurs despite medical therapy [^32ea7f1e].

---

## Long-term management and follow-up

- **Observation**: Consider for low-risk, asymptomatic patients after shared decision-making [^703fd6e3] [^486b7bbd].

- **Anticoagulation**: Use standard AF protocols based on CHA₂DS₂-VASc [^notfound].

- **Follow-up**: Monitor for recurrence and complications, including AF recurrence after ablation [^de2aea2c].

---

## Special considerations

In pediatric patients, **prophylactic ablation** is considered for high-risk asymptomatic children [^76d76efa]. In pregnancy, avoid **electrical cardioversion** if possible; use beta-blockers or procainamide if needed. In patients with structural heart disease, ablation may be more complex and require specialized expertise [^3490581c].

---

## Summary of treatment algorithm

| **Clinical scenario** | **Recommended treatment** |
|-|-|
| Hemodynamically unstable | Immediate synchronized cardioversion [^31f5060f] |
| Hemodynamically stable | IV procainamide or ibutilide [^7c6aa0ba]; avoid AV nodal blockers [^31f5060f] |
| Definitive therapy | Catheter ablation of accessory pathway [^8f491660] |
| Long-term management | Observation or ablation; anticoagulation per CHA2DS2-VASc [^notfound] |

---

The cornerstone of management is **early recognition**, avoidance of harmful drugs, and definitive ablation when indicated [^8f491660].

### Long-term natural history of adult Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome patients treated with and without catheter ablation [^0b5a3a47]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

There are a paucity of data about the long-term natural history of adult Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) patients in regard to risk of mortality and atrial fibrillation. We sought to describe the long-term outcomes of WPW patients and ascertain the impact of ablation on the natural history.

Methods and Results

Three groups of patients were studied: 2 WPW populations (ablation: 872, no ablation: 1461) and a 1:5 control population (n = 11 175). Long-term mortality and atrial fibrillation rates were determined. The average follow-up for the WPW group was 7.9 ± 5.9 (median: 6.9) years and was similar between the ablation and nonablation groups. Death rates were similar between the WPW group versus the control group (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.83–1.11; P = 0.56). Nonablated WPW patients had a higher long-term death risk compared with ablated WPW patients (hazard ratio, 2.10; 95% confidence interval: 1.50–20.93; P < 0.0001). Incident atrial fibrillation risk was higher in the WPW group compared with the control population (hazard ratio, 1.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.29–1.87; P < 0.0001). Nonablated WPW patients had lower risk than ablated patients (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% confidence interval, 0.28–0.53; P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Long-term mortality rates in WPW patients are low and similar to an age-matched and gender-matched control population. WPW patients that underwent the multifactorial process of ablation had a lower mortality compared to nonablated WPW patients. Atrial fibrillation rates are high long-term, and ablation does not reduce this risk.

### A randomized study of prophylactic catheter ablation in asymptomatic patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^623af02a]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2003). Excellent credibility.

Background

Young age and inducibility of atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia or atrial fibrillation during invasive electrophysiological testing identify asymptomatic patients with a Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern on the electrocardiogram as being at high risk for arrhythmic events. We tested the hypothesis that prophylactic catheter ablation of accessory pathways would provide meaningful and durable benefits as compared with no treatment in such patients.

Methods

From 1997 to 2002, among 224 eligible asymptomatic patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, patients at high risk for arrhythmias were randomly assigned to radio-frequency catheter ablation of accessory pathways (37 patients) or no treatment (35 patients). The end point was the occurrence of arrhythmic events over a five-year follow-up period.

Results

Patients assigned to ablation had base-line characteristics that were similar to those of the controls. Two patients in the ablation group (5 percent) and 21 in the control group (60 percent) had arrhythmic events. One control patient had ventricular fibrillation as the presenting arrhythmia. The five-year Kaplan-Meier estimates of the incidence of arrhythmic events were 7 percent among patients who underwent ablation and 77 percent among the controls (P < 0.001 by the log-rank test); the risk reduction with ablation was 92 percent (relative risk, 0.08; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.02 to 0.33; P < 0.001).

Conclusions

Prophylactic accessory-pathway ablation markedly reduces the frequency of arrhythmic events in asymptomatic patients with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who are at high risk for such events.

### Atrial fibrillation in the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: ECG recognition and treatment in the ED [^cc2ef0d8]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Estimated to occur in 0.1% to 0.3% of the population, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) is a condition where atrial impulses bypass the atrioventricular node and activate the ventricular myocardium directly via an accessory pathway. Clinical clues to the diagnosis include a young patient with previous episodes of palpitations, rapid heart rate, or syncope. Although several different rhythm presentations are possible, atrial fibrillation is a not infrequent dysrhythmia seen in the WPW patient. Electrocardiographic features suggestive of WPW atrial fibrillation include irregularity of the rhythm; a very rapid ventricular response; presence of a delta wave; and a wide, bizarre QRS complex. Stable patients suspected of having this condition should not receive agents that predominantly block atrioventricular conduction, but they may be treated with procainamide or ibutilide. If instability is present, electrical cardioversion is required.

### Antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation… [^ac0fdcc6]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Patients with atrial fibrillation typically have thrombi in the left atrial appendage that are most likely caused by circulatory stasis. These thrombi can then embolize. Patients with structural heart disease or other risk factors are at much greater risk for emboli. Identification of the optimal treatment for patients with atrial fibrillation has generated much debate. Treatment with warfarin alone has been shown to decrease embolic vascular complications and stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. In fact, the benefits of warfarin appear to increase when the International Normalized Ratio was 2 to 3 in patients with a history of stroke. Aspirin appears to be effective in treating nonvalvular atrial fibrillation in patients younger than 65 years who have no risk factors. However, warfarin remains the treatment of choice in most patients, particularly those who have had a previous transient ischemic attack or a minor stroke.

Combination therapy using low-intensity, fixed-dose warfarin and aspirin is less effective than adjusted-dose warfarin, especially in patients with high-risk factors. The authors endorse the recommendations of the American College of Chest Physicians Consensus Conference on anti-thrombolytic therapy. First, patients younger than 65 years of age with no other risk factors should take aspirin. However, the presence of even one risk factor in patients in this group warrants the use of warfarin. Second, patients between 65 and 75 years with no risk factors may be treated with either aspirin or warfarin. If one or more risk factors are present, the patient should be treated with warfarin. Third, all patients over 75 years of age should be treated with warfarin. Another question concerns the duration of anticoagulation therapy with warfarin.

Must it be continued for life even if the patient is accurately able to determine the presence or absence of fibrillation. What is the role of the newer antiplatelet medications. The only issue that appears to be clear is that patients with atrial fibrillation should be treated with antithrombotic medication to decrease the risk of systemic embolism and stroke.

### Long term risk of Wolff-Parkinson-White pattern and syndrome [^39264956]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

For years, conventional wisdom has held that patients with asymptomatic ventricular pre-excitation (asymptomatic WPW or WPW pattern) were at low risk for adverse outcomes. This assumption has been challenged more recently in a number of observational/natural history studies as well as in prospective trials in which patients were more aggressively studied via invasive electrophysiology study (EPS) and more aggressively treated, in some cases, with pre-emptive catheter ablation, despite the lack of symptoms. In sum, the data do not definitively support one approach (early, up-stream EPS and/or ablation) vs. the other (watchful waiting with close monitoring). The most recent pediatric and adult guidelines reflect this ambiguity with a broad spectrum of approaches endorsed.

### Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome in the era of catheter ablation: insights from a registry study of 2169 patients [^1b4c94bf]. Circulation (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The management of Wolff-Parkinson-White is based on the distinction between asymptomatic and symptomatic presentations, but evidence is limited in the asymptomatic population.

Methods and Results

The Wolff-Parkinson-White registry was an 8-year prospective study of either symptomatic or asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White patients referred to our Arrhythmology Department for evaluation or ablation. Inclusion criteria were a baseline electrophysiological testing with or without radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA). Primary end points were the percentage of patients who experienced ventricular fibrillation (VF) or potentially malignant arrhythmias and risk factors. Among 2169 enrolled patients, 1001 (550 asymptomatic) did not undergo RFA (no-RFA group) and 1168 (206 asymptomatic) underwent ablation (RFA group). There were no differences in clinical and electrophysiological characteristics between the 2 groups except for symptoms. In the no-RFA group, VF occurred in 1.5% of patients, virtually exclusively (13 of 15) in children (median age, 11 years), and was associated with a short accessory pathway antegrade refractory period (P < 0.001) and atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia initiating atrial fibrillation (P < 0.001) but not symptoms. In the RFA group, ablation was successful in 98.5%, and after RFA, no patients developed malignant arrhythmias or VF over the 8-year follow-up. Untreated patients were more likely to experience malignant arrhythmias and VF (log-rank P < 0.001). Time-dependent receiver-operating characteristic curves for predicting VF identified an optimal anterograde effective refractory period of the accessory pathway cutoff of 240 milliseconds.

Conclusions

The prognosis of the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome essentially depends on intrinsic electrophysiological properties of AP rather than on symptoms. RFA performed during the same procedure after electrophysiological testing is of benefit in improving the long-term outcomes.

### ACC / AHA / ESC 2006 guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines and the European Society of Cardiology committee for practice guidelines (writing committee to revise the 2001 guidelines for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation): developed in collaboration with the European Heart Rhythm Association and the Heart Rhythm Society [^a9418268]. Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — causes and associated conditions include reversible triggers, AF without demonstrable heart disease, and metabolic contributors. AF may be related to acute, temporary causes such as alcohol intake, surgery, electrocution, myocardial infarction (MI), pericarditis, myocarditis, pulmonary embolism or other pulmonary diseases, hyperthyroidism, and other metabolic disorders, and successful treatment of the underlying condition often eliminates AF. AF that develops in the setting of acute MI portends an adverse prognosis compared with preinfarction AF or sinus rhythm, and AF may be associated with atrial flutter, the Wolff–Parkinson–White (WPW) syndrome, or atrioventricular (AV) nodal reentrant tachycardias, where treatment of the primary arrhythmias reduces or eliminates recurrent AF; AF is a common early postoperative complication of cardiac or thoracic surgery. AF is often an electrical manifestation of underlying cardiac disease, yet approximately 30% to 45% of cases of paroxysmal AF and 20% to 25% of cases of persistent AF occur in younger patients without demonstrable underlying disease. Obesity is an important risk factor for development of AF, and after adjustment the excess risk appears mediated by left atrial dilation, with a graded increase in left atrial size as body mass index increases from normal to the overweight and obese categories.

Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) preexcitation syndromes with atrial fibrillation — treatment recommendations are: Catheter ablation of the accessory pathway is recommended in symptomatic patients with AF who have WPW syndrome, particularly those with syncope due to rapid heart rate or those with a short bypass tract refractory period (Level of Evidence: B). Immediate direct-current cardioversion is recommended to prevent ventricular fibrillation in patients with a short anterograde bypass tract refractory period in whom AF occurs with a rapid ventricular response associated with hemodynamic instability (Level of Evidence: B). Intravenous procainamide or ibutilide is recommended to restore sinus rhythm in patients with WPW in whom AF occurs without hemodynamic instability in association with a wide QRS complex on the ECG (greater than or equal to 120-ms duration) or with a rapid preexcited ventricular response (Level of Evidence: C). Intravenous flecainide or direct-current cardioversion is reasonable when very rapid ventricular rates occur in patients with AF involving conduction over an accessory pathway (Level of Evidence: B). It may be reasonable to administer intravenous quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide, ibutilide, or amiodarone to hemodynamically stable patients with AF involving conduction over an accessory pathway (Level of Evidence: B). Intravenous administration of digitalis glycosides or nondihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists is not recommended in patients with WPW syndrome who have preexcited ventricular activation during AF (Level of Evidence: B).

5.1 Ventricular Fibrillation in Patients With Accessory AV Pathway (Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome)

Patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who develop atrial fibrillation are at high risk of ventricular fibrillation. Treatment of these patients with digoxin leads to greater slowing of conduction in the atrioventricular node than in accessory pathways, and the risks of rapid ventricular response leading to ventricular fibrillation are thereby increased.

5.2 Sinus Bradycardia and Sino-atrial Block

Digoxin may cause severe sinus bradycardia or sinoatrial block particularly in patients with pre-existing sinus node disease and may cause advanced or complete heart block in patients with pre-existing incomplete AV block. Consider insertion of a pacemaker before treatment with digoxin.

Introduction

Patients with Wolff‐Parkinson‐White syndrome and atrial fibrillation (AF), also known as preexcited AF, typically presents with a rapid ventricular response rate and wide QRS complexes. The fast conduction of atrial high‐frequency impulses occurs preferentially via the accessory pathway (AP), which has a shorter refractory period than the atrioventricular node (AVN). Consequently, patients are at a higher risk of hemodynamic instability, spontaneous ventricular fibrillation (VF), and cardiac arrest. 1, 2, 3 Patients with preexcited AF who present with hemodynamic instability typically undergo prompt electrical cardioversion. Those with stable hemodynamics are commonly treated with infusion of an antiarrhythmic drug to decrease the preexcited ventricular rate and prevent hemodynamic instability. The 2017 European Heart Rhythm Association Consensus 4 recommends procainamide, propafenone, flecainide, or ibutilide, whereas the 2014 American Heart Association Guidelines recommend 5 procainamide or ibutilide for intravenous use to acutely slow ventricular rate of preexcited AF. The above 4 agents, however, are not recommended for the treatment of patients with preexcited AF and impaired left ventricular function (ILVF). 6, 7, 8, 9 Intravenous amiodarone, a multichannel blocker, was widely used in the treatment of patients with preexcited AF and ILVF. 10 However, the recent reports of accelerated preexcited ventricular responses and VF during amiodarone infusion have raised concerns about its utility. 11, 12, 13, 14 Therefore, intravenous amiodarone is no longer considered the preferred drug of choice for treatment of preexcited AF. 4, 5 Thus, there is a need for a new agent for treatment of preexcited AF, particularly in patients with ILVF.

### Catheter ablation therapy for supraventricular arrhythmias [^fcbb318f]. JAMA (2007). Excellent credibility.

The supraventricular arrhythmias include a wide spectrum of disorders including, in descending order of frequency, atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, atrioventricular nodal reentry, Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, and atrial tachycardia. While not life-threatening in most cases, they may cause important symptoms, such as palpitations, chest discomfort, breathlessness, anxiety, and syncope, which significantly impair quality of life. Medical therapy has variable efficacy, and most patients are not rendered free of symptoms. Research over the past several decades has revealed fundamental mechanisms involved in the initiation and maintenance of all of these arrhythmias. Knowledge of mechanisms has in turn led to highly effective surgical and catheter-based treatments. Atrial fibrillation remains a therapeutic challenge but is also yielding to investigation and therapeutic efforts. The supraventricular arrhythmias and their treatment are described in this report.

### Atrial fibrillation with wide QRS tachycardia and undiagnosed Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas in a pediatric patient [^2483bdc8]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

A 10-year-old girl presented to the emergency department of a regional hospital with 1 episode of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Postictal monitoring followed by a 12-lead electrocardiogram showed fast atrial fibrillation with intermittent wide QRS regular tachycardia. Immediately following this, her rhythm changed to wide QRS irregular tachycardia without hemodynamic compromise. She was suspected to have ventricular tachycardia and was treated with intravenous amiodarone with cardioversion to sinus rhythm. Subsequent electrocardiogram in sinus rhythm showed typical features of manifest Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) accessory pathway. This case illustrates the diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas in patients with atrial fibrillation, wide QRS tachycardia, and undiagnosed WPW syndrome with antidromic conduction of atrial arrhythmias through the accessory pathway. Furthermore, this case demonstrates that undiagnosed wide QRS tachycardias need to be treated with drugs acting on the accessory pathway, thus keeping in mind underlying WPW syndrome as a possibility to avoid potentially catastrophic events.

### Atrial flutter with 1: 1 conduction in undiagnosed Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^2b1149a6]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial flutter with 1:1 atrioventricular conduction via an accessory pathway is an uncommon presentation of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome not previously reported in the emergency medicine literature. Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, a form of ventricular preexcitation sometimes initially seen and diagnosed in the emergency department (ED), can present with varied tachydysrhythmias for which certain treatments are contraindicated. For instance, atrial fibrillation with preexcited conduction needs specific consideration of medication choice to avoid potential degeneration into ventricular fibrillation.

Case Report

We describe an adult female presenting with a very rapid, regular wide complex tachycardia successfully cardioverted in the ED followed by a normal electrocardiogram (ECG). Electrophysiology study confirmed atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction and revealed an accessory pathway consistent with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, despite lack of ECG findings of preexcitation during sinus rhythm. Why should an emergency physician be aware of this? Ventricular tachycardia must be the first consideration in patients with regular wide complex tachycardia. However, clinicians should consider atrial flutter with 1:1 conduction related to an accessory pathway when treating patients with the triad of very rapid rate (> 250 beats/min), wide QRS complex, and regular rhythm, especially when considering pharmacologic treatment. Emergency physicians also should be aware of electrocardiographically concealed accessory pathways, and that lack of delta waves does not rule out preexcitation syndromes such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.

### Effect of pulmonary vein isolation on atrial fibrillation recurrence after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^97ca4f25]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Atrial fibrillation (AF) occurs frequently in patients with Wolff‐Parkinson‐White (WPW) syndrome, with a reported incidence of 9% to 38%. 1, 2, 3, 4 Although previous studies have reported a decreased incidence of AF after successful elimination of the accessory pathway (AP), 5, 6 paroxysmal AF frequently recurs in some patients with WPW syndrome despite successful AP elimination. 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 Our recent study found that the presence of advanced interatrial block (IAB) and age > 50 years were associated with a higher risk of AF recurrence after AP ablation in WPW patients. 10 For patients at high risk of AF recurrence, additional preventive interventions are required. Currently, pulmonary vein intervention (PVI) is a widely accepted treatment for symptomatic paroxysmal AF. 11 However, it is unknown whether additional PVI after successful AP ablation effectively prevents AF recurrence in patients with WPW syndrome, especially in patients at high risk of AF recurrence. Thus, the purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate the efficacy of additional PVI after AP ablation in preventing AF recurrence in all patients with WPW syndrome and paroxysmal AF, and in patients at high risk of AF recurrence, identified by advanced IAB or age > 50 years.

### Mechanisms for atrial fibrillation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^4e70e09b]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2002). Low credibility.

Introduction

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) frequently occurs in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. To elucidate the mechanisms for PAF, we performed electrophysiologic studies (EPS) before and after ablation of accessory pathways (APs).

Methods and Results

We investigated 24 patients with WPW syndrome who had AV reciprocating tachycardia and prior PAF and had undergone successful ablation of APs. Patients in whom atrial fibrillation (AF) was induced by EPS at day 7 after ablation were considered the inducible AF group (n = 14), and patients in whom AF was not induced by EPS at day 7 after ablation were considered the noninducible AF group (n = 10). Fifteen patients with AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) but without PAF who underwent ablation of the slow AV nodal pathways served as the control group (AVNRT group). Maximal atrial conduction delay and conduction delay zone, which are indices of atrial vulnerability, were measured before and after ablation. Before ablation, maximal atrial conduction delay and conduction delay zone were significantly greater (P < 0.0001 and P < 0.0001, respectively) in the two WPW syndrome groups than in the AVNRT group, indicating increased atrial vulnerability in WPW syndrome with PAF. After ablation, these parameters did not change in the inducible AF group, whereas they were significantly (P < 0.0001) decreased in the noninducible AF group and were not different from those in the AVNRT group, indicating normalized atrial vulnerability in the noninducible AF group after ablation. The prospective study demonstrated that PAF recurred only in the inducible AF group during long-term follow-up (17 ± 7 months).

Conclusion

The findings of this study suggest that there are two mechanisms of PAF in patients with WPW syndrome: one mechanism is reversible and AP-dependent atrial vulnerability, and the other is intrinsic and AP-independent atrial vulnerability.

### Tachydysrhythmia treatment and adverse events in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^77740145]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Current guidelines recommend avoiding atrioventricular-nodal blocking agents (AVNB) when treating tachydysrhythmias in Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW) patients.

Study Objectives

We investigated medications selected and resulting outcomes for patients with tachydysrhythmias and WPW.

Methods

In this single-center retrospective cohort study, we searched a hospital-wide database for the following inclusion criteria: WPW, tachycardia, and intravenous antidysrhythmics. The composite outcome of adverse events was acceleration of tachycardia, new hypotension, new malignant dysrhythmia, and cardioversion. The difference in binomial proportions of patients meeting the composite outcome after AVNB or non-AVNB (NAVNB) treatment was calculated after dividing the groups by QRS duration. A random-effects mixed linear analysis was performed to analyze the vital sign response.

Results

The initial database search yielded 1158 patient visits, with 60 meeting inclusion criteria. Patients' median age was 52.5 years; 53% were male, 43% presented in wide complex tachycardia (WCT), with 75% in atrial fibrillation (AF) or flutter. AVNBs were administered in 42 (70%) patient visits. For those patients with WCT in AF, the difference in proportions of patients meeting the composite outcome after AVNBs vs. NAVNBs treatment was an increase of 3% (95% confidence interval [CI] -39%-49%), and for those with narrow complex AF it was a decrease of 13% (95% CI -37%-81%). No instances of malignant dysrhythmia occurred. Mixed linear analysis showed no statistically significant effects on heart rate, though suggested a trend toward increasing heart rate after AVNB in wide complex AF.

Conclusion

In this sample of WPW-associated tachydysrhythmia patients, many were treated with AVNBs. The composite outcome was similarly met after use of either AVNB or NAVNB, and no malignant dysrhythmias were observed.

### Prophylactic radiofrequency ablation in asymptomatic patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White is not yet a good strategy: a decision analysis [^1b915b57]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Therapeutic management of asymptomatic patients with a Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) pattern is controversial. We compared the risk:benefit ratios between prophylactic radiofrequency ablation and no treatment in asymptomatic patients with WPW.

Methods and Results

Decision analysis software was used to construct a risk-benefit decision tree. The target population consisted of 20- to 40-year-old asymptomatic patients with WPW without structural fatal heart disease or a family history of sudden cardiac death. Baseline estimates of sudden death and radiofrequency ablation complication rates were obtained from the literature, an empirical data survey, and expert opinion. The outcome measure was death within 10 years. Sensitivity analyses determined the variables that significantly impacted the decision to ablate or not. Threshold analyses evaluated the effects of key variables and the optimum policy. At baseline, the decision to ablate resulted in a reduction of mortality risk of 8.8 patients for 1000 patients compared with abstention. It is necessary to treat 112 asymptomatic patients with WPW to save one life over 10 years. Sensitivity analysis showed that 3 variables significantly impacted the decision to ablate: (1) complication of radiofrequency ablation, (2) success of radiofrequency ablation, and (3) sudden death in asymptomatic patients with WPW.

Conclusions

This study provides a decision aid for treating asymptomatic patients with the WPW ECG pattern. Using the model and the population we tested, prophylactic catheter ablation is not yet ready for widespread clinical use.

### Surgical implications in the current treatment of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^a95d6f9a]. World Journal of Surgery (2002). Low credibility.

There are currently two different surgical approaches to the abnormal pathway, Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome-the endocardial (ENDO) and epicardial (EPI) techniques. In recent years, ablation of accessory pathways can be achieved by catheter-induced radiofrequency (RF) current. This study was undertaken to assess our results of surgical treatment for WPW syndrome in the current era of catheter ablation. From 1985 to 1993, 51 patients (33 male and 18 female) with WPW syndrome underwent operations for ablation of accessory pathways. Associated anomalies included Ebstein's anomaly, coronary artery disease, and tricuspid atresia. Preoperatively, 6 patients underwent unsuccessful RF catheter ablation. Fifteen (29%) patients were operated with the ENDO technique and 36 (71%) with the EPI technique. There was no early death in either group. In the immediate postoperative period 40 (78%) patients were in sinus rhythm. The electrophysiological studies revealed successful ablation of the pathway in 50 (98%) patients. On complete late follow-up (mean, 36 months) all patients were back to preoperative levels of activity. Our experience indicates that excellent results can be achieved with each of these two techniques. The left free wall accessory pathways may be ablated in a more reproducible way with the ENDO approach. The concept that surgical ablation of accessory pathways may prevent further atrial fibrillation is supported by the low incidence in this series. Operations for WPW syndrome may become indicated for RF ablation failure, when additional procedures are required. In these cases the surgical skill should be available, and this is a skill that should not be lost.

### Prognostic significance and risk of atrial fibrillation of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [^fa1461e4]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

To assess the mid-term mortality and risk of atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HC) and Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, 40 patients with HC and WPW were enrolled in our center between 2010 and 2017. An age- and gender-matched comparison cohort of patients with HC without WPW (n = 160) was generated from the same center. The clinical profile and outcomes were assessed. Of 40 patients with WPW, 28 underwent accessory pathway (AP) elimination. Two patients (7%) had failed in AP elimination. During mid-term follow-up, 1 patient had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator intervention. Fourteen patients had AF. A previous history of AF (hazard ratio [HR]: 4.69; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.51 to 14.63) and left atrial dimension (HR: 1.12; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.23) at baseline were risk factors for AF occurrence during follow-up. The AP elimination significantly reduced risk for the incidence of AF (HR: 0.22; 95% CI 0.06 to 0.83). Compared with the control group, the prevalence of syncope and AF were significantly higher in the WPW group. During follow-up, no difference was identified in outcome measures consisting of all-cause death, cardiac transplantation, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator intervention. A previous history of AF (HR: 5.20; 95% CI 2.63 to 10.30, p < 0.001) and persistent existing WPW (HR: 3.64; 95% CI 1.63 to 8.11, p = 0.002) were independent risk factors for AF occurrence during follow-up in the entire cohort. In conclusion, although WPW was uncommon and might not be correlated with mid-term mortality in HC patients, WPW might increase the risk of AF occurrence. Additionally, AP elimination may reduce the risk of AF occurrence.

### Advanced interatrial block predicts recurrence of atrial fibrillation after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^d90e54e1]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Because patients with advanced IAB have a high risk of AF recurrence after AP ablation, additional interventions are required to prevent AF recurrence in this population. Pulmonary vein isolation is an established effective treatment for paroxysmal AF. 30 However, we did not assess whether pulmonary vein isolation was effective for preventing AF recurrence in patients in the present study. Although the pulmonary vein is reportedly involved in the development of paroxysmal AF in patients with WPW syndrome, 8 atrial substrate abnormalities partially determine the likelihood of AF recurrence after AP ablation in these patients. 4 Thus, the clinical efficacy of pulmonary vein isolation for preventing AF recurrence in these patients requires further study.

### Effect of pulmonary vein isolation on atrial fibrillation recurrence after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^0c7fc3aa]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Although successful ablation of the accessory pathway (AP) eliminates atrial fibrillation (AF) in some of patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome and paroxysmal AF, in other patients it can recur.

Hypothesis

Whether adding pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) after successful AP ablation effectively prevents AF recurrence in patients with WPW syndrome is unknown.

Methods

We retrospectively studied 160 patients (102 men, 58 women; mean age, 46 ± 14years) with WPW syndrome and paroxysmal AF who underwent AP ablation, namely 103 (64.4%) undergoing only AP ablation (AP group) and 57 (35.6%) undergoing AP ablation plus PVI (AP+PVI group). Advanced interatrial block (IAB) was defined as a P-wave duration of > 120ms and biphasic (±) morphology in the inferior leads, using 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG).

Results

During the mean follow-up period of 30.9 ± 9.2 months (range, 3-36months), 22 patients (13.8%) developed AF recurrence. The recurrence rate did not differ in patients in the AP+PVI group and AP group (15.5% vs 10.5%, respectively; P = 0.373). Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses showed that PVI was not associated with the risk of AF recurrence (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.26–1.68; P = 0.380). In WPW patients with advanced IAB, the recurrence rate was lower in patients in the AP+PVI group vs the AP group (90% vs 33.3%, respectively; P = 0.032).

Conclusions

PVI after successful AP ablation significantly reduced the AF recurrence rate in WPW patients with advanced IAB. Screening of a resting 12-lead ECG immediately after AP ablation helps identify patients in whom PVI is beneficial.

Abstract

Background

Although successful ablation of the accessory pathway (AP) eliminates atrial fibrillation (AF) in some of patients with Wolff‐Parkinson‐White (WPW) syndrome and paroxysmal AF, in other patients it can recur.

Hypothesis

Whether adding pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) after successful AP ablation effectively prevents AF recurrence in patients with WPW syndrome is unknown.

Methods

We retrospectively studied 160 patients (102 men, 58 women; mean age, 46 ± 14 years) with WPW syndrome and paroxysmal AF who underwent AP ablation, namely 103 (64.4%) undergoing only AP ablation (AP group) and 57 (35.6%) undergoing AP ablation plus PVI (AP + PVI group). Advanced interatrial block (IAB) was defined as a P‐wave duration of > 120 ms and biphasic (±) morphology in the inferior leads, using 12‐lead electrocardiography (ECG).

Results

During the mean follow‐up period of 30.9 ± 9.2 months (range, 3‐36 months), 22 patients (13.8%) developed AF recurrence. The recurrence rate did not differ in patients in the AP + PVI group and AP group (15.5% vs 10.5%, respectively; P = 0.373). Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses showed that PVI was not associated with the risk of AF recurrence (hazard ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.26‐1.68; P = 0.380). In WPW patients with advanced IAB, the recurrence rate was lower in patients in the AP + PVI group vs the AP group (90% vs 33.3%, respectively; P = 0.032).

Conclusions

PVI after successful AP ablation significantly reduced the AF recurrence rate in WPW patients with advanced IAB. Screening of a resting 12‐lead ECG immediately after AP ablation helps identify patients in whom PVI is beneficial.

### Surgical treatment of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: resuscitation of a forgotten technique [^4c4ac3a0]. JTCVS Techniques (2023). Medium credibility.

Presurgical History

The patient is a 27-year-old man with history of WPW and 2 prior unsuccessful catheter ablation attempts who presented with cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation. He was successfully resuscitated, and after recovery was noted to have an ejection fraction of 20% with an electrocardiogram showing a short PR interval and a delta wave (Figure 1, A). Electrophysiology mapping indicated a posterior-septal accessory pathway. Multiple attempts to ablate the accessory pathway endocardially and via the middle cardiac vein were unsuccessful. One additional attempt at catheter ablation via both endocardial and epicardial mapping and ablation was unsuccessful. In view of resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation due to rapid atrial fibrillation conducting rapidly over the accessory pathway, the patient was referred for surgical ablation.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, more specifically with respect to electrocardiography, ACC/AHA/HRS 2016 guidelines recommend to elicit any of the following in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients with pre-excitation to identify patients at low risk of developing rapid conduction over the pathway:

- abrupt loss of conduction over the pathway during exercise testing in sinus rhythm

- intermittent loss of pre-excitation during ECG or ambulatory monitoring.

### Advanced interatrial block predicts recurrence of atrial fibrillation after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^ba21f2dc]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

5 DISCUSSION

The main findings of the present study are that advanced IAB and age > 50 years were independent predictors of AF recurrence after successful AP ablation in patients with WPW syndrome.

Previous studies have shown that patients with WPW syndrome have a high incidence of paroxysmal AF. 1, 2, 3, 4 Recent studies suggest that although AP ablation alone may prevent further AF recurrence in the majority of these patients, the incidence of paroxysmal AF remains higher than that in the general population even after successful AP ablation. 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 This is supported by our finding that 15.5% (16/103) of patients with verified paroxysmal AF and WPW syndrome developed AF recurrence after successful AP ablation. This phenomenon may be explained by the two mechanisms of paroxysmal AF in patients with WPW syndrome reported in previous studies. 9, 23, 24 One mechanism involves AP‐dependent atrial electrophysiological abnormalities that are reversible, and the other involves AP‐independent atrial electrophysiological abnormalities that are intrinsic and seemingly irreversible even after successful AP ablation.

### Risk of malignant arrhythmias in initially symptomatic patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: results of a prospective long-term electrophysiological follow-up study [^319faeef]. Circulation (2012). Low credibility.

Background

The available amount of detailed long-term data in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome is limited, and no prospective electrophysiological studies looking at predictors of malignant arrhythmia are available.

Methods and Results

Among 8575 symptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White patients with atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia referred for electrophysiological test, 369 (mean age, 23 ± 12.5 years) declined catheter ablation and were followed up. The primary end point of the study was to evaluate over a 5-year follow-up the predictors and characteristics of patients who develop malignant arrhythmias. After a mean follow-up of 42.1 ± 10 months, malignant arrhythmias developed in 29 patients (mean age, 13.9 ± 5.6 years; 26 male), resulting in presyncope/syncope (25 patients), hemodynamic collapse (3 patients), or cardiac arrest caused by ventricular fibrillation (1 patient). Of the remaining 340 patients, 168 (mean age, 34.2 ± 9.0 years) remained asymptomatic up to 5 years, and 172 (mean age, 13.6 ± 5.1 years) had benign recurrence, including sustained atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia (132 patients) or atrial fibrillation (40 patients). Compared with the group with no malignant arrhythmias, the group with malignant arrhythmias showed shorter accessory-pathway effective refractory period (P < 0.001) and more often exhibited multiple accessory pathways (P < 0.001), and atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia triggering sustained pre-excited atrial fibrillation was more frequently inducible (P < 0.001). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that short accessory-pathway effective refractory period (P < 0.001) and atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia triggering sustained pre-excited atrial fibrillation (P < 0.001) were independent predictors of malignant arrhythmias.

Conclusions

Symptomatic patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome generally have a good outcome, and predictors of malignant arrhythmias are similar to those reported for asymptomatic patients with ventricular pre-excitation.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: electrophysiological and clinical findings [^b7110571]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Nifekalant, initially named MS‐551 in Japan, is a pure class 3 antiarrhythmic drug that is highly selective for blocking the rapid component of the delayed‐rectifier potassium currents without affecting the inward sodium and calcium currents or β‐adrenergic activity. 15, 16 Nifekalant prolongs the effective refractory period (ERP) of ventricular and atrial myocytes, exerts antiarrhythmic effects, 16 and decreases the defibrillation threshold. 17 Increasing clinical data indicate that nifekalant is an effective and safe drug in treatment of refractory ventricular arrhythmias, especially in the patients with ILVF. 18, 19, 20, 21 Nifekalant is also recommended by the European Resuscitation Council Guidelines and International Consensus on Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation for treatment of ventricular arrhythmias. 22, 23 More recently, nifekalant has been used in treatment of atrial arrhythmia and cardioversion of AF and atrial flutter. 24, 25 However, the potential utility of nifekalant in the treatment of preexcited AF has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to assess the electrophysiological and clinical effects of nifekalant in patients with preexcited AF.

### Broad complex atrial fibrillation [^1d2cd9e7]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

The management of broad complex atrial fibrillation is complex and may be a source of morbidity and mortality if not correctly recognized and treated appropriately. We present a case series of 3 patients who were managed in our emergency department after complaints of palpitations. They presented with varying forms of rapid atrial fibrillation that had broad complexes on the 12-lead electrocardiogram. The first 2 patients were treated with calcium channel blockers for rate control, and treatment was complicated by rapid arrhythmia that required cardioversion. The final patient was correctly treated with intravenous procainamide. The diagnosis of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome was eventually made in all these patients. Broad complex atrial fibrillation must be treated with respect. Cases with rapid ventricular rate can decompensate from mismanagement due to poor ability to recognize the possibility of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome in such patients. Procainamide forms the cornerstone of treatment in hemodynamically stable rapid broad complex atrial fibrillation of unknown origin.

5.1 Ventricular Fibrillation in Patients With Accessory AV Pathway (Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome)

Patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who develop atrial fibrillation are at high risk of ventricular fibrillation. Treatment of these patients with digoxin leads to greater slowing of conduction in the atrioventricular node than in accessory pathways, and the risks of rapid ventricular response leading to ventricular fibrillation are thereby increased.

5.2 Sinus Bradycardia and Sino-atrial Block

LANOXIN may cause severe sinus bradycardia or sinoatrial block particularly in patients with pre-existing sinus node disease and may cause advanced or complete heart block in patients with pre-existing incomplete AV block. Consider insertion of a pacemaker before treatment with digoxin.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Special concerns regarding specific arrhythmias — sex differences and Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW): WPW syndrome and orthodromic atrioventricular (AV) reciprocating tachycardia are more common in men than in women, and in patients with WPW syndrome manifest pathways are more common in men, whereas antidromic AV reciprocating tachycardia is more common in women than in men. Atrial fibrillation (AF) degenerating to ventricular fibrillation (VF) is more common in men than in women. For symptomatic WPW syndrome, the treatment of choice is radiofrequency (RF) ablation and the outcomes are similar in both sexes; during pregnancy, management may require initiation of antiarrhythmic drugs to block the accessory pathway and, in some, long-term monitoring. The incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) at any age is greater in men than in women. Classic predictors such as obesity, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), hyperlipidemia, and tobacco use are associated with coronary heart disease (CHD) and ventricular tachycardia (VT) more in men, whereas for women, hyperglycemia, elevated hematocrit, and decreased vital capacity are more important predictors; the impact of diabetes is seen in both sexes but is much more pronounced in women. While nonsustained VT (NSVT) and premature ventricular complexes (PVCs) have been associated with increased risk of sudden death in men with or without CHD, no such association has been seen in women; similarly, PVCs post–myocardial infarction (post-MI) in men have been associated with increased mortality, which does not hold true for women.

### Effect of pulmonary vein isolation on atrial fibrillation recurrence after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^c58d59ae]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

The main findings in this study were as follows: (a) PVI after successful AP ablation significantly reduced AF recurrence in the subgroup of WPW patients with advanced IAB and (b) PVI did not reduce AF recurrence in nonselective WPW patients and in patients aged > 50 years.

Previous studies have shown that patients with WPW syndrome have a high incidence of paroxysmal AF. 1, 2, 3, 4 The potential mechanisms responsible for the occurrence of AF in patients with WPW syndrome is thought to be non‐PV related, and are attributed to spontaneous degeneration of atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia into AF, electrical properties of the AP, effects of AP on atrial architecture, and intrinsic atrial muscle vulnerability. 17, 18 However, Derejko et al 8 recently suggested a potential role of the PVs also in patients with WPW syndrome and AF. Because successful ablation of the AP eliminates AF in some patients but not in other patients, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 it is suggested that AP‐dependent and AP‐independent paroxysmal AF exist in patients with WPW. PVI is a widely accepted treatment option for symptomatic paroxysmal AF. 11 Although the PV is reportedly involved in the development of paroxysmal AF in patients with WPW syndrome, 8 atrial substrate abnormalities are thought to be mainly associated with the risk of AF recurrence. 4, 9 Thus, it is unknown whether additional PVI immediately after AP ablation effectively prevents AF recurrence in these patients. A recent study showed that adding PVI after successful ablation of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (29 of the patients had APs) reduced the AF recurrence rate, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. 19 Kawabata et al 6 compared the efficacy of AP ablation alone and additional AF ablation on accompanying AF and found that adding PVI did not improve the freedom from residual AF compared with AP ablation alone in all patients with WPW syndrome and AF; however, adding PVI significantly reduced AF recurrence in a subgroup of patients with brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) concentrations > 40 pg/mL. The authors concluded that screening BNP concentrations would identify the subset of patients in whom additional PVI would be beneficial. However, BNP concentrations might fluctuate because BNP is affected by many factors.

### Advanced interatrial block predicts recurrence of atrial fibrillation after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^de2aea2c]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) frequently occurs in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. Although successful ablation of the accessory pathway (AP) eliminates paroxysmal AF in some patients, in other patients it can recur.

Hypothesis

We investigated the clinical utility of advanced interatrial block (IAB) for predicting the risk of AF recurrence in patients with verified paroxysmal AF and WPW syndrome after successful AP ablation.

Methods

This retrospective study included 103 patients (70 men, 33 women; mean age, 44 ± 16years) with WPW syndrome who had paroxysmal AF. A resting 12-lead electrocardiogram was performed immediately after successful AP ablation to evaluate the presence of advanced IAB, which was defined as a P-wave duration of > 120ms and biphasic morphology in the inferior leads.

Results

During the mean follow-up period of 30.9 ± 20.0 months (range, 2-71months), 16 patients (15.5%) developed AF recurrence. Patients with advanced IAB had significantly reduced event-free survival from AF (P < .001). Cox regression analysis with adjustment for the left atrial diameter and CHA ₂ DS ₂ -VASc score identified advanced IAB (hazard ratio, 9.18; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.30–36.72; P = 0.002) and age > 50years (hazard ratio, 12.64; 95% CI, 1.33–119.75; P = 0.027) as independent predictors of AF recurrence.

Conclusions

Advanced IAB was an independent predictor of AF recurrence after successful AP ablation in patients with WPW syndrome.

Additional PVI after successful AP ablation may not reduce AF recurrence in nonselective WPW patients; however, the AF recurrence rate was reduced significantly in the subgroup of WPW patients with advanced IAB.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: electrophysiological and clinical findings [^fcbc07a0]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The primary concern with the use of nifekalant is the development of TdP. Katoh et al reported a TdP rate of 3.9% in 1402 emergency patients with ventricular arrhythmias who were treated with nifekalant, 34 which was much lower than the corresponding rate of 8.3% for ibutilide. 8 In the present study only 1 of 339 patients with preexcited AF, PSVT, or AF alone (0.3%) developed TdP during nifekalant infusion, which was associated with a low serum potassium level (3.0 mmol/L) and preceded by sinus bradycardia (40 beats/min). Nifekalant significantly prolonged the QT interval, which was transient and returned to normal within 1.5 hours after nifekalant termination. The latter likely reflects the short half‐life of nifekalant (1.5‐2.0 hours). QT prolongation by nifekalant was not associated with an arrhythmic event with the exception of 1 patient who developed TdP. Nifekalant slightly decreased the sinus rate but did not affect AH, HV, PR, QRS interval or SBP during sinus rhythm. In addition, nifekalant did not accelerate the preexcited ventricular responses or lead to VF or cardiac arrest.

AF induced in the EP lab often terminates spontaneously within 20 minutes. Our study did not use a randomized approach with a placebo group. This limitation of the study makes it difficult to interpret the efficacy of nifekalant in terminating AF in these patients. Hence, a randomized placebo‐controlled design with large samples would be expected to address this problem.

In conclusion, the findings of the present study show that nifekalant is an effective and a relatively safe drug for the treatment of patients with preexcited AF with or without ILVF. Nifekalant mainly exerts its effects by prolonging the ERP of antegrade AP without blocking the AVN conduction. Therefore, intravenous nifekalant might be a desirable agent for treatment of patients with preexcited AF, particularly in a subset of patients with ILVF.

### Part 9: adult advanced life support: 2025 American Heart Association guidelines for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and emergency cardiovascular care [^4c050e27]. Circulation (2025). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation or flutter with rapid ventricular response — synopsis: Treating AF/flutter with rapid ventricular rates depends on hemodynamic stability, and unstable patients and those with rate-related ischemia often need urgent electrical cardioversion. Stable patients can be treated pharmacologically to achieve rate or rhythm control. Conversion of AF/flutter greater than 48 hours in nonanticoagulated patients risks thromboembolic events. For acute AF/flutter assessed as less than 48 hours, decision making is more nuanced, requiring expert consultation unless emergent cardioversion is needed. Pre-excited AF/flutter (Wolff–Parkinson–White) is covered under Wide-Complex Tachycardias.

Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

Asymptomatic pre-excitation — epidemiology and prior guideline context note that electrocardiographic pre-excitation affects about 0.1% to 0.3% of the general population, and patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome have an increased risk of sudden cardiac death that may approach 4% over a lifetime. The 2003 ACC/AHA/ESC Guidelines designated "no treatment" as a Class I recommendation and catheter ablation as a Class IIa recommendation in patients with asymptomatic pre-excitation; the guideline writing committee stated that the positive predictive value of the EP study is too low to justify routine use in asymptomatic patients and that potential benefit must be balanced against the approximately 2% risk of a major complication associated with catheter ablation.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: electrophysiological and clinical findings [^c7636cab]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The efficacy of nifekalant in preexcited atrial fibrillation has not been assessed.

Methods and Results

The study populations consisted of patients with sustained preexcited(n = 51), paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (n = 201), and persistent(n = 87). Effects of intravenous infusion of nifekalant were assessed on electrophysiological and clinical parameters. Nifekalant prolonged the shortest preexcited R‐R, the average preexcited R‐R, and the average R‐R intervals from 290 ± 35 to 333 ± 44 ms, 353 ± 49 to 443 ± 64 ms, and 356 ± 53 to 467 ± 75 ms, respectively, in patients with preexcited(all P < 0.001). Nifekalant also decreased the percentage of preexcitedcomplexes, heart rate, and increased systolic pressure (all P < 0.001). Nifekalant terminatedin 33 of 51 patients (65%). Similar effects were also observed in a subgroup of 12 patients with preexcitedand impaired left ventricular function. In patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, nifekalant significantly prolonged the effective refractory period, the block cycle length of the antegrade accessory pathway, and the atrial effective refractory period (all P < 0.001). Nifekalant had no effect on the effective refractory period of the antegrade atrioventricular node. Finally, in patients with persistentwithout an accessory pathway, nifekalant did not significantly decrease the ventricular rate of. One patient developed Torsades de Pointes. No other adverse effects were observed.

Conclusions

Nifekalant prolongs the effective refractory period of the antegrade accessory pathway and atrium without blocking antegrade conduction through the atrioventricular node, leading to slowing and/or to termination of preexcited. Thus, nifekalant might be an effective and a relatively safe drug in patients with preexcited.

### P wave signal-averaged electrocardiography predicts recurrence of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who underwent successful catheter ablation: a prospective study [^f184ca1d]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2002). Low credibility.

Introduction

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) frequently occurs in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome. Catheter ablation of the accessory pathway eliminates PAF in some patients, but PAF frequently recurs in other patients. The present study was designed to determine prospectively whether P wave signal-averaged electrocardiography (P-SAECG) predicts the recurrence of PAF after successful ablation in patients with WPW syndrome.

Methods and Results

Forty-six patients with WPW syndrome who had episodes of PAF were prospectively followed. SAECG recording was performed on day 7 after successful ablation of the accessory pathway at study entry. Abnormal P-SAECG for the prediction of recurrence of PAF was defined as a filtered P wave duration > 130 msec. Eleven patients had an abnormal P-SAECG (group 1), whereas 35 patients (group 2) did not. The two groups did not differ in terms of gender, age, left atrial dimension, and atrial vulnerability as determined by electrophysiologic study. During follow-up (40 ± 19 months), the recurrence of PAF was noted in 10 (91%) of 11 patients in group 1, whereas it was observed in only 2 (6%) of 35 patients in group 2. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the recurrence of PAF was significantly more frequent in group 1 than in group 2 (log rank test, P < 0.0001). By multivariate analysis, filtered P wave duration > 130 msec was an independent predictor of recurrence of PAF after ablation (Chi-square = 21.5, P < 0.0001).

Conclusion

The results of this study indicate that P-SAECG may be useful for identifying patients at risk for recurrence of PAF after successful ablation of WPW syndrome.

### Effect of pulmonary vein isolation on atrial fibrillation recurrence after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^f3e05186]. Clinical Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of additional PVI after AP ablation in preventing AF recurrence, and in a subgroup of patients with advanced IAB or aged > 50 years. Our study showed that additional PVI after AP ablation did not reduce the AF recurrence rate in nonselective WPW patients, which is in accordance with the findings of Kawabata et al's study. In addition, we found that PVI significantly reduced the AF recurrence rate in the subgroup of WPW patients with advanced IAB. Our findings suggest that, for patients at high risk of AF recurrence identified by advanced IAB, additional PVI after AP ablation can be considered effective to prevent AF recurrence. Screening of a resting 12‐lead ECG immediately after AP ablation helps identify patients in whom PVI should be performed. Furthermore, our results also strengthen the consideration that PVI may not be necessary in nonselective patients with WPW syndrome and AF.

Because several studies showed that age > 50 years was an independent predictor of AF recurrence after AP ablation, 3, 4, 7, 10 we examined the efficacy of additional PVI after AP ablation in preventing AF recurrence in these subgroup of patients, in the present study. We found that additional PVI did not significantly reduce AF recurrence in these patients. This information suggests that, although it was an independent predictor of AF recurrence after successful AP, age > 50 years may not identify the subset of WPW patients in whom PVI in addition to AP ablation would be beneficial.

### Catheter ablation of supraventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation [^33b55b5a]. American Family Physician (2009). Low credibility.

Supraventricular arrhythmias are relatively common, often persistent, and rarely life-threatening cardiac rhythm disturbances that arise from the sinus node, atrial tissue, or junctional sites between the atria and ventricles. The term "supraventricular arrhythmia" most often is used to refer to supraventricular tachycardias and atrial flutter. The term "supraventricular tachycardia" commonly refers to atrial tachycardia, atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, and atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia, an entity that includes Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Atrial fibrillation is a distinct entity classified separately. Depending on the arrhythmia, catheter ablation is a treatment option at initial diagnosis, when symptoms develop, or if medical therapy fails. Catheter ablation of supraventricular tachycardias, atrial flutter, and atrial fibrillation offers patients high effectiveness rates, durable (and often permanent) therapeutic end points, and low complication rates. Catheter ablation effectiveness rates exceed 88 percent for atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia, atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia, and atrial flutter; are greater than 86 percent for atrial tachycardia; and range from 60 to 80 percent for atrial fibrillation. Complication rates for supraventricular tachycardias and atrial flutter ablation are 0 to 8 percent. The complication rates for atrial fibrillation ablation range from 6 to 10 percent. Complications associated with catheter ablation result from radiation exposure, vascular access (e.g., hematomas, cardiac perforation with tamponade), catheter manipulation (e.g., cardiac perforation with tamponade, thromboembolic events), or ablation energy delivery (e.g., atrioventricular nodal block).

Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome in congenital heart disease — management: Tachycardia symptoms may begin in childhood but become increasingly problematic in adult years, when atrial dilation or surgical scars predispose the patient to atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation with potential for rapid conduction over an accessory pathway. An attempt at definitive therapy with catheter ablation has become the standard of care for these patients, but compared with simple accessory pathway ablation in a structurally normal heart, the acute success rates are reported to be lower and the risk of recurrence higher in patients with anatomic defects. Intraoperative accessory pathway ablation can be considered in the patient with Ebstein's anomaly referred for operative intervention for tricuspid valve disease, and this approach has been demonstrated to be safe and effective.

### Advanced interatrial block predicts recurrence of atrial fibrillation after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^1a1bc640]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Background

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) frequently occurs in patients with Wolff‐Parkinson‐White (WPW) syndrome. Although successful ablation of the accessory pathway (AP) eliminates paroxysmal AF in some patients, in other patients it can recur.

Hypothesis

We investigated the clinical utility of advanced interatrial block (IAB) for predicting the risk of AF recurrence in patients with verified paroxysmal AF and WPW syndrome after successful AP ablation.

Methods

This retrospective study included 103 patients (70 men, 33 women; mean age, 44 ± 16 years) with WPW syndrome who had paroxysmal AF. A resting 12‐lead electrocardiogram was performed immediately after successful AP ablation to evaluate the presence of advanced IAB, which was defined as a P‐wave duration of > 120 ms and biphasic morphology in the inferior leads.

Results

During the mean follow‐up period of 30.9 ± 20.0 months (range, 2‐71 months), 16 patients (15.5%) developed AF recurrence. Patients with advanced IAB had significantly reduced event‐free survival from AF (P < .001). Cox regression analysis with adjustment for the left atrial diameter and CHA ₂ DS ₂ ‐VASc score identified advanced IAB (hazard ratio, 9.18; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.30‐36.72; P = 0.002) and age > 50 years (hazard ratio, 12.64; 95% CI, 1.33‐119.75; P = 0.027) as independent predictors of AF recurrence.

Conclusions

Advanced IAB was an independent predictor of AF recurrence after successful AP ablation in patients with WPW syndrome.

Methods

The authors declare that all supporting data are available within the article.

We conducted 3‐part prospective noninvasive and invasive electrophysiology (EP) studies to determine the efficacy of nifekalant in preexcited AF and to assess its mechanisms of action (Figure 1). All patients provided written informed consent, and the study protocol was approved by the Committee on Human Research at the Second Affiliated Hospital of NanChang University, NanChang of JiangXi Province. All the antiarrhythmic medications were discontinued for at least 5 drug half‐lives before the study.

Electrophysiological and Clinical Evaluation of Nifekalant in Patients With Preexcited AF

Fifty‐one patients (mean age 53 ± 12 years, 33 males) with sustained preexcited AF and stable hemodynamics were treated with nifekalant. Twenty patients (39%) had spontaneous sustained preexcited AF (at least 1 hour before admission). Twelve (24%) had preexcitation and paroxysmal AF. These patients had sinus rhythm and preexcitation on ECG on admission. Nineteen patients (37%) had preexcitation and paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) but no documented AF. They had sinus rhythm and preexcitation on ECG on admission. The latter 2 groups (31 patients) were induced to generate sustained AF during EP studies. Nifekalant was administered if induced AF was sustained for 10 minutes.

Effects of Nifekalant on AVN Conduction in Patients With AF and No AP

Electrophysiological effects of nifekalant on AVN conduction in patients with AF but no AP were determined. Nifekalant infusion terminated AF in 33 of 87 (38%) patients. Fifty‐four of 87 (62%) patients continued to have AF after 30 minutes of nifekalant treatment. The mean age of this group without AF termination was 58 ± 13 years (range 18‐74 years), and 32 were male. Twenty of 54 patients (37%) had structural heart diseases and a low left ventricular ejection fraction (37 ± 5%). The ventricular rate was 97 ± 17, 97 ± 16, 99 ± 18, 101 ± 20, 103 ± 22, 104 ± 24, 102 ± 21, 96 ± 19, and 95 ± 15 beats/min at baseline and after 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20, and 30 minutes of infusion, respectively. Nifekalant did not significantly decrease the mean ventricular rate of AF in the absence of an AP (97 ± 17 versus 95 ± 15 beats/min, n = 54, P = 0.22). A trend toward an increased ventricular rate was noted at infusion time 0 to 10 minutes, and a trend toward a decrease at 10 to 30 minutes of the infusion period. In addition, the mean SBP in patients with AF but no AP did not change with nifekalant infusion (106 ± 16 versus 109 ± 17 mm Hg, n = 54, P = 0.30). No TdP occurred in these patients during nifekalant infusion.

5 LIMITATIONS

Several limitations of our study should be considered. First, the small sample size may have introduced statistical bias. Further studies of larger numbers of patients are needed to further evaluate the effects of PVI on AF recurrence after AP ablation in patients with WPW syndrome. Second, it is not possible to identify advanced IAB before AP ablation in patients with WPW syndrome because the delta wave overshadows the point at which the P‐wave ends. Additionally, P‐wave duration was measured based on the ECG obtained immediately after the ablation procedure; thus, residual atrial injury from the ablation procedure may have affected the P‐wave duration. Finally, the generalizability of our findings may be limited by the single‐center, retrospective, observational approach.

### Natural history of Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome diagnosed in childhood [^5b515d4e]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome carries a risk for symptomatic arrhythmias and sudden death. The aim of this study was to examine the natural history of patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome diagnosed in childhood followed longitudinally at a single institution. The study population consisted of 446 patients. The median age of diagnosis was 7 years, and 61% were male. Associated heart disease was present in 40 patients (9%). Modes of presentation included supraventricular tachycardia (38%), palpitations (22%), chest pain (5%), syncope (4%), atrial fibrillation (0.4%), sudden death (0.2%), and incidental findings (26%); data were unavailable in 4%. During the study period, a total of 243 patients (54%) had supraventricular tachycardia, and 7 patients (1.6%) had atrial fibrillation. Of patients who presented at ≤ 3 months of age, 35% had resolution of manifest preexcitation compared with 5.8% who presented at > 3 months of age (p < 0.0001). There were 6 sudden deaths (1.3%), with an incidence of 2.8 per 1,000 patient-years. Two of these patients had structurally normal hearts (incidence 1.1 per 1,000 patient-years). Four of these patients had associated heart disease (incidence 27 per 1,000 patient-years) (p < 0.01). In conclusion, in a large population of patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome diagnosed in childhood, 64% had symptoms at presentation, and an additional 20% developed symptoms during follow-up. There were 6 sudden deaths (1.3%), with an overall incidence of 1.1 per 1,000 patient-years in patients with structurally normal hearts and 27 per 1,000 patient-years in patients with associated heart disease.

### Radiofrequency ablation in children with asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^76d76efa]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). Excellent credibility.

Background

Ventricular fibrillation can be the presenting arrhythmia in children with asymptomatic Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Deaths due to this arrhythmia are potentially preventable.

Methods

We performed a randomized study in which prophylactic radiofrequency catheter ablation of accessory pathways was compared with no ablation in asymptomatic children (age range, 5 to 12 years) with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome who were at high risk for arrhythmias. The primary end point was the occurrence of arrhythmic events during follow-up.

Results

Of the 165 eligible children, 60 were determined to be at high risk for arrhythmias. After randomization, but before any ablation had been performed, the parents withdrew 13 children from the study. Of the remaining children, 20 underwent prophylactic ablation and 27 had no treatment. The characteristics of the two groups were similar. There were three ablation-related complications, one of which led to hospitalization. During follow-up, 1 child in the ablation group (5 percent) and 12 in the control group (44 percent) had arrhythmic events. Two children in the control group had ventricular fibrillation, and one died suddenly. The cumulative rate of arrhythmic events was lower among children at high risk who underwent ablation than among those at high risk who did not. The reduction in risk associated with ablation remained significant after adjustment in a Cox regression analysis. In both the ablation and the control groups, the independent predictors of arrhythmic events were the absence of prophylactic ablation and the presence of multiple accessory pathways.

Conclusions

In asymptomatic, high-risk children with the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, prophylactic catheter ablation performed by an experienced operator reduces the risk of life-threatening arrhythmias.

### Advanced interatrial block predicts recurrence of atrial fibrillation after accessory pathway ablation in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome [^a2ff69ce]. Clinical Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) occurs frequently in patients with Wolff‐Parkinson‐White (WPW) syndrome, with a reported incidence of 9% to 38%. 1, 2, 3, 4 Previous studies have reported a decreased incidence in AF after successful elimination of the accessory pathway (AP), 5, 6 indicating that the AP itself may play an important role in the initiation of AF. However, paroxysmal AF still frequently recurs in some patients with WPW syndrome despite successful AP elimination. 3, 4, 7, 8, 9 The identification of patients at high risk for recurrence of AF is of clinical importance because additional therapeutic strategies are needed for these patients.

Interatrial block (IAB) denotes a conduction delay between the right and left atria that manifests in a 12‐lead electrocardiogram (ECG) as a P‐wave duration of > 120 ms. 10, 11 A prolonged P‐wave with biphasic (±) morphology in the inferior leads represents an even higher degree of IAB and has been referred to as advanced IAB. 10 The appearance of advanced IAB is frequently associated with atrial tachyarrhythmias, and has been found to predict AF in multiple clinical scenarios. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 However, the role of advanced IAB in predicting the recurrence of AF after AP ablation in patients with WPW syndrome is unclear. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the clinical utility of advanced IAB for predicting the risk of AF recurrence in patients with verified paroxysmal AF and WPW syndrome after successful AP ablation.

Clinical Trial Results

In controlled studies in the United States, bolus doses of 3, 6, 9, and 12 mg were studied. A cumulative 60% of patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia had converted to normal sinus rhythm within one minute after an intravenous bolus dose of 6 mg adenosine (some converted on 3 mg and failures were given 6 mg), and a cumulative 92% converted after a bolus dose of 12 mg. Seven to sixteen percent of patients converted after 1–4 placebo bolus injections. Similar responses were seen in a variety of patient subsets, including those using or not using digoxin, those with Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome, males, females, blacks, Caucasians, and Hispanics.

Adenosine is not effective in converting rhythms other than PSVT, such as atrial flutter, atrial fibrillation, or ventricular tachycardia, to normal sinus rhythm.

2 METHODS

2.1 Patients

Consecutive patients with overt or intermittent WPW syndrome who were hospitalized at Henan Provincial People's Hospital and Fuwai Central China Cardiovascular Hospital for radiofrequency ablation between January 2013 and September 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. The inclusion criteria were (a) at least one documented episode of AF before ablation; (b) undergoing AP ablation, with or without catheter ablation for AF during the same session; (c) successful AP ablation, defined as the elimination of AP conduction by demonstrated atrial and ventricular pacing even after isoproterenol infusion; and (d) available records of a post‐ablation, 12‐lead electrocardiogram (ECG). The exclusion criteria were (a) repeated ablations; (b) previous cardiac surgery, congenital heart disease, or serious valvular heart disease; and (iii) thyroid dysfunction on admission (abnormal free thyroxine or thyroid‐stimulating hormone level). We divided patients into two groups: the "AP group" constituted patients who underwent AP ablation without PVI, and the "AP + PVI group" constituted patients who underwent AP ablation and PVI during the same session. The study protocol conformed to the ethical guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki. All patients were informed about the investigational nature of the catheter ablation procedure and provided written informed consent to undergo the procedure. The study protocol was approved by the local institutional review board, and the requirement for informed consent for this study was waived because of its retrospective nature.

### Reentry in an accessory atrioventricular pathway as a trigger for atrial fibrillation initiation in manifest Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome: a matter of reflection? [^fdbdf7db]. Heart Rhythm (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Patients with an accessory pathway (AP) have an increased propensity to develop atrial fibrillation (AF), but the mechanism is unknown.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to identify crucial risk factors and to test the hypothesis that reflection and/or microreentry of atrial impulses propagating into the AP triggers AF.

Methods

Five hundred thirty-four patients successfully treated with radiofrequency ablation of AP at two university hospitals were evaluated. Patients were separated into those with concealed vs those with manifest AP in terms of their propensity to develop AF. To investigate AF triggering mechanisms, linear and branched two-dimensional models of atrium-to-ventricle propagation across a heterogeneous 1 x 6 AP using human ionic kinetics were simulated.

Results

A history of AF was twice as common in patients with manifest AP vs concealed AP irrespective of AP location. AF was more likely to occur in older males and in patients with larger atria. There was no correlation between AF history and AP refractory measures. However, the electrophysiologic properties of APs seemed to fulfill the prerequisites for reflection and/or microreentry of atrially initiated impulses. In the linear AP model, repetitive atrial stimulation resulted in progressively larger delay of atrium-to-ventricle propagation across the passive segment. Eventually, sufficient time for repolarization of the atrial segment allowed for reflection of an impulse that activated the entire atrium and by wavefront-wavetail interaction with a new atrial stimulus AF reentry was initiated. Simulations using the branched model showed that microreentry at the ventricular insertion of the AP could also initiate AF via retrograde atrial activation as a result of unidirectional block at the AP-ventricle junction.

Conclusion

Propensity for AF in patients with an AP is strongly related to preexcitation, larger atria, male gender, and older age. Reflection and microreentry at the AP may be important for AF initiation in patients with manifest (preexcited) Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Similar mechanisms also may trigger AF in patients without an AP.

### Efficacy of nifekalant in patients with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome and atrial fibrillation: electrophysiological and clinical findings [^8ad9c4bb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

The effects of procainamide, propafenone, flecainide, and ibutilide, recommended by the guideline or consensus, 4, 5 on preexcited AF have been reported by several investigators. Sellers et al 29 evaluated procainamide in 21 patients with preexcited AF. Boahene et al 30 evaluated procainamide in 30 patients and propafenone in 25 patients. Ludmer et al 31 evaluated propafenone in 10 patients, O'Nunain et al 32 evaluated propafenone and flecainide in 16 patients, and Glatter et al 33 evaluated ibutilide in 14 patients. All showed the effectiveness of the 4 agents in preexcited AF, albeit with different magnitudes of efficacy. For example, Boahene et al showed propafenone prolonged SPRR from 215 ± 40 to 415 ± 198 ms (ΔSPRR 200 ms), Ludmer et al 31 showed propafenone ΔSPRR to be 75 ms, whereas O'Nunain et al showed propafenone ΔSPRR to be 37 ms, which indicated the presence of considerable heterogeneity among the studies. Factors contributing to the heterogeneity might include drug dose, infusion speed and time, intrinsic ERP of antegrade AP, hemodynamic status, sympathetic and parasympathetic tone, and others. The heterogeneity was more evident in the small‐sample‐size studies. Therefore, it is difficult to compare the effectiveness of nifekalant and other agents in treatment of preexcited AF. Randomized controlled studies with large samples would be valuable to determine the comparative effectiveness of these agents. One notable difference is that propafenone, flecainide, and ibutilide could completely block the AP, whereas nifekalant did not completely block AP in the present study and, hence, did not interfere with subsequent AP ablation. It is also important to note that procainamide, propafenone, flecainide, and ibutilide are not generally used in patients with ILVF, but nifekalant does not seem to have any deleterious effect in patients with ILVF. Thus, intravenous nifekalant might be considered as an alternative drug to treat preexcited AF in patients without left ventricular dysfunction and as a preferred drug in patients with preexcited AF and ILVF.

3 RESULTS

We enrolled 160 patients in this study, namely 103 patients in the AP group and 57 patients in the AP + PVI group. Advanced IAB was detected in 16 (10.0%) patients, namely 10 patients in the AP group and 6 patients in the AP + PVI group. Patients' baseline characteristics in both groups are shown in Table 1.

TABLE 1
Baseline characteristics of the study population

During the mean follow‐up period of 30.9 ± 9.2 months (range, 3‐36 months), 22 patients (13.8%) developed AF recurrence. The recurrence rate was 15.5% and 10.5% in the AP group and AP + PVI group, respectively. Kaplan‐Meier analysis showed that freedom from recurrent AF was not significantly different between the AP group and AP + PVI group (log‐rank test, P = 0.373; Figure 1).

Univariable Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that, for the overall study population after the ablation procedure, age > 50 years; diabetes mellitus; coronary artery disease; CHA ₂ DS ₂ ‐VASc (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age ≥ 75 years, diabetes mellitus, stroke/transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, age 65‐74 years, sex category) score; LA diameter; and advanced IAB were associated with the risk of recurrence. Multivariable analysis identified advanced IAB (hazard ratio, 5.50; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.29‐13.22; P < .001), and age > 50 years (hazard ratio, 10.02; 95% CI, 2.20‐45.59; P = 0.003) as independent predictors of AF recurrence (Table 2). The PVI procedure was not associated with the risk of AF recurrence in univariable and multivariable Cox regression analyses.

Conventional catheter ablation of cardiac arrhythmias is associated with the potential adverse effects of low-dose ionizing radiation on both patients and laboratory personnel. Due to the greater radiation sensitivity and the longer life expectancy of children, reduction of radiation exposure for them is of particular importance.

### Verapamil hci [^0c7e3741]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS & USAGE

Verapamil is indicated for the treatment of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, including:

- Rapid conversion to sinus rhythm of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardias, including those associated with accessory bypass tracts (Wolff-Parkinson-White [WPW] and Lown-Ganong-Levine [LGL] syndromes). When clinically advisable, appropriate vagal maneuvers (e.g. Valsalva maneuver) should be attempted prior to Verapamil administration.

- Temporary control of rapid ventricular rate in atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation, except when the atrial flutter and/or atrial fibrillation are associated with accessory bypass tracts (Wolff-Parkinson-White [WPW] and Lown-Ganong-Levine [LGL] syndromes).

In controlled studies in the U.S., about 60% of patients with supraventricular tachycardia converted to normal sinus rhythm within 10 minutes after intravenous Verapamil hydrochloride. Uncontrolled studies reported in the world literature describe a conversion rate of about 80%. About 70% of patients with atrial flutter and/or fibrillation with a fast ventricular rate respond with a decrease in heart rate of at least 20%. Conversion of atrial flutter or fibrillation to sinus rhythm is uncommon (about 10%) after Verapamil hydrochloride and may reflect the spontaneous conversion rate, since the conversion rate after placebo was similar. The effect of a single injection lasts for 30–60 minutes when conversion to sinus rhythm does not occur.

Because a small fraction (< 1.0%) of patients treated with Verapamil hydrochloride respond with life-threatening adverse responses (rapid ventricular rate in atrial flutter/fibrillation with an accessory bypass tract, marked hypotension, or extreme bradycardia/asystole — see Contraindications and Warnings), the initial use of intravenous Verapamil hydrochloride should, if possible, be in a treatment setting with monitoring and resuscitation facilities, including DC-cardioversion capability (see Suggested Treatment of Acute Cardiovascular Adverse Reactions). As familiarity with the patient's response is gained, an office setting may be acceptable.

Cardioversion has been used safely and effectively after intravenous Verapamil.
