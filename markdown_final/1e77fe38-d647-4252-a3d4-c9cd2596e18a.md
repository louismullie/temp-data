## Question

Treatment of afib with amiodarone and the risk of pulmonary toxicity

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the risk of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity in the treatment of atrial fibrillation, including how dose, route, and patient factors influence that risk, and how to monitor and manage it safely in clinical practice. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what exactly constitutes amiodarone pulmonary toxicity and its clinical phenotypes. Then, I should quantify the baseline incidence across settings and eras. Next, I will examine dose and route effects, followed by patient-specific risk modifiers. After that, I should integrate contemporary guideline positions to frame decision-making. Finally, I will translate this into a pragmatic monitoring protocol and outline diagnostic and therapeutic steps if toxicity is suspected, while verifying each claim against high-quality sources as I go.

> Let me first confirm the definition and spectrum of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity, because I need to ensure we are classifying events consistently. Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity encompasses hypersensitivity pneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, and interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis, and it can present acutely, subacutely, or chronically; in some series, rates of clinically apparent disease have been reported as high as 17%, with case fatality around 10%, so I should keep a high index of suspicion for severe forms, particularly acute presentations [^114WMBm5] [^111hTKHo] [^116pG2pV].

> Next, I should review incidence estimates and reconcile them with contemporary AF populations, because older versus newer cohorts may differ. Historical estimates often cite 1% to 10% for pulmonary toxicity, and meta-analyses of randomized trials show an increased risk of pulmonary adverse events versus placebo, yet more recent AF cohorts treated with lower maintenance doses report absolute incidences closer to 1% to 2% and, in one nationwide study, a modest, non-significant association with interstitial lung disease after adjustment, suggesting attenuated risk in modern practice, so I need to be careful not to overgeneralize older high-dose data to today's 200 mg/day regimens [^115Lu7cT] [^1128FiHz] [^116Bc6mg] [^1163bdjq].

> Hold on, I should verify dose and route effects, since many questions hinge on this. For chronic oral therapy, the 2023 ACC/AHA guideline places pulmonary toxicity at about 1% to 2% with low-dose regimens, and small case series document toxicity even at 200 mg/day, confirming that low dose does not eliminate risk, whereas intravenous therapy has been associated with early-onset injury and ARDS in clinical studies and postmarketing reports, including reports of 2% ARDS during 48-hour courses, so I must treat any new respiratory symptoms on IV amiodarone as urgent and potentially drug-related [^116Bc6mg] [^1168SKKN] [^1163bdjq] [^111rWaSP] [^115xT76f].

> I will now examine patient-specific risk modifiers, and I need to check that I weigh the strongest signals correctly. Advanced age, preexisting lung disease such as COPD or ILD, ventricular arrhythmia indications, higher cumulative dose, and perioperative or critical illness settings increase risk, with population data showing a markedly higher hazard among COPD patients and a strong signal for postoperative ARDS in pneumonectomy cohorts. Renal disease also appears associated, though the mechanism remains unclear, so I should avoid or minimize amiodarone in these high-risk contexts when alternatives exist [^115Lu7cT] [^116Ar6hj] [^112DTDaf] [^116s5qgA].

> Wait, let me verify the guideline synthesis so I don't overstate or understate recommendations. Contemporary AF guidelines consistently position amiodarone as a second-line rhythm-control agent because of its extracardiac toxicity profile, including pulmonary fibrosis and ILD, but they also acknowledge its superior efficacy and special role in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction where other agents may be less suitable; thus, use should be individualized with explicit risk–benefit discussions and documented shared decision-making [^115Lu7cT] [^113wfZqX] [^113SZaLd].

> Next, I should review the practical monitoring plan, and I need to ensure it aligns with labeling and guideline minimums. Baseline chest radiography and symptom assessment are recommended, with some labeling advising baseline diffusion capacity though guidelines acknowledge limited predictive value of routine PFTs; thereafter, periodic clinical review with chest radiography every 3 to 6 months is advised, with earlier imaging for new cough, dyspnea, or hypoxia, and high-resolution chest CT considered when plain films are equivocal but suspicion remains high [^112ce4FK] [^1175svQX] [^1173z1sc] [^117EwCpK].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about diagnostic testing. I should double-check that my diagnostic algorithm is realistic. The diagnosis of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity remains one of exclusion, so I must rule out infection, heart failure, and malignancy, and consider that dual-energy CT may help identify iodine-rich consolidations consistent with amiodarone deposition, while bronchoscopy with BAL can support alternative diagnoses or reveal eosinophilia in hypersensitivity phenotypes. Early involvement of pulmonology is prudent when the presentation is atypical or severe [^115xT76f] [^111F3g48] [^114pxAHM].

> I need to ensure the management steps are clear and time-sensitive. Immediate actions include discontinuing amiodarone, correcting contributory factors such as hypoxia and electrolytes, and initiating supportive care. Corticosteroids are commonly used for inflammatory subtypes with typical dosing in the 40 to 60 mg prednisone daily range tapered over weeks, recognizing that evidence is largely observational and recovery may be slow due to the drug's long half-life and persistence of metabolites [^116pG2pV] [^111hTKHo].

> But wait, what if the arrhythmia control strategy now lacks an effective agent after stopping amiodarone? I should review alternatives and their trade-offs. Dronedarone avoids iodine but is less effective and contraindicated in permanent AF and in decompensated or advanced heart failure, sotalol and dofetilide require inpatient initiation with QT monitoring, and catheter ablation becomes an increasingly attractive option to reduce long-term drug toxicity exposure, so the plan should be tailored to LV function, ischemia, and patient preferences [^114nt8Gy] [^113brkQ5] [^113wfZqX].

> Let me reconsider special populations where my threshold should be lowest. In patients with severe COPD or ILD, after pneumonectomy, in the immediate postoperative period with high FiO2 or mechanical ventilation, or in lung transplant recipients, the balance of risk often favors avoiding amiodarone when possible, and thoracic surgery guidance explicitly recommends alternatives in many of these scenarios, so I should document why amiodarone is necessary if I proceed despite these risks [^112DTDaf] [^116s5qgA] [^115DXhKN].

> In summary, I should confirm that my counseling and consent reflect the following: in contemporary AF practice using low-dose oral regimens, the absolute risk of pulmonary toxicity is about 1% to 2% but can be higher in older adults, those with underlying lung disease, on higher cumulative doses, or receiving IV therapy, with case fatality near 10% in severe presentations. With guideline-concordant monitoring and a low threshold to evaluate new respiratory symptoms, amiodarone remains a valuable agent for selected patients, particularly with HFrEF, but it should generally be reserved after considering safer alternatives and the patient's risk profile [^116Bc6mg] [^117VVNw3] [^113wfZqX] [^113brkQ5].

---

Amiodarone is effective for AF rhythm control [^113brkQ5] but carries a **clinically important risk of pulmonary toxicity** [^114WMBm5], with an incidence of 1–2% on chronic therapy [^116Bc6mg] and a fatality rate around 10% [^1175svQX]. Risk rises with **higher cumulative doses** [^116Ar6hj], pre-existing lung disease [^115Lu7cT], older age, and perioperative use [^112DTDaf]; acute toxicity can occur within days to weeks, especially with IV use [^114oCxg1] [^1163bdjq]. Baseline chest X-ray and pulmonary function tests (including DLCO) are recommended [^112ce4FK], with repeat chest X-ray every 3–6 months and prompt evaluation of new respiratory symptoms [^116pG2pV]. If toxicity is suspected, stop amiodarone and start corticosteroids; **early recognition and drug cessation are critical** to outcomes [^116pG2pV].

---

## Incidence and clinical significance

- **Incidence**: Pulmonary toxicity occurs in 1–2% of patients on chronic amiodarone [^116Bc6mg], with higher rates in some series (up to 17%) [^1175svQX].
- **Fatality**: Approximately 10% of cases are fatal [^1175svQX] [^116Bc6mg].
- **Presentation**: Typically presents with nonproductive cough, dyspnea, fever, and hypoxia [^1163bdjq]; radiographic findings include interstitial infiltrates, pleural effusions, and pulmonary fibrosis [^114WMBm5].

---

## Risk factors

Several factors **increase the risk** of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity:

| **Risk factor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Cumulative dose | Higher cumulative dose strongly increases risk [^116Ar6hj] |
| Pre-existing lung disease | COPD, interstitial lung disease, and prior lung injury elevate risk [^115Lu7cT] [^116Ar6hj] |
| Age | Older patients have higher risk [^116Ar6hj] |
| Perioperative use | IV amiodarone postoperatively increases ARDS risk [^112DTDaf] [^116pG2pV] |
| Rapid IV loading | Early-onset toxicity can occur within days to weeks [^114oCxg1] [^1163bdjq] |

---

## Clinical manifestations

Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity presents in **three main forms**:

- **Acute**: Rapid-onset dyspnea, hypoxemia, and ARDS, often postoperatively [^115xT76f] [^1163bdjq].
- **Subacute**: Progressive cough, dyspnea, and interstitial infiltrates over weeks to months [^116pG2pV].
- **Chronic**: Pulmonary fibrosis with progressive respiratory insufficiency [^114WMBm5].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and monitoring

Diagnosis is **primarily clinical**, supported by imaging and pulmonary function tests:

- **Baseline assessment**: Chest X-ray and pulmonary function tests (including DLCO) before starting therapy [^112ce4FK] [^1173z1sc].
- **Routine monitoring**: Repeat chest X-ray every 3–6 months and prompt evaluation of new respiratory symptoms [^112ce4FK] [^1173z1sc].
- **Imaging**: High-resolution CT can identify characteristic findings and differentiate from other causes [^117EwCpK] [^111F3g48].
- **Bronchoalveolar lavage**: May show lymphocytosis and eosinophilia, supporting the diagnosis [^notfound].

---

## Management strategies

Management centers on **immediate discontinuation of amiodarone** and supportive care:

- **Drug cessation**: Stop amiodarone immediately upon suspicion of toxicity [^116pG2pV].
- **Corticosteroids**: Prednisone 40–60 mg/day tapered over several weeks is recommended [^116pG2pV].
- **Supportive care**: Oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation if necessary, and treatment of underlying respiratory conditions [^116pG2pV].
- **Alternative antiarrhythmic therapy**: Consider sotalol, dofetilide, or catheter ablation based on patient-specific factors [^1168Dh75].

---

## Preventive measures

To **minimize risk**, use the lowest effective dose, avoid rapid IV loading when possible, and exercise caution in patients with pre-existing lung disease or in perioperative settings [^112DTDaf] [^116Ar6hj]. Maintain vigilance with regular monitoring and patient education to recognize early symptoms [^1173z1sc].

---

## Comparison with other antiarrhythmic medications

Amiodarone is more effective than many alternatives for maintaining sinus rhythm [^113brkQ5] but has a **higher risk of pulmonary toxicity** than sotalol, dofetilide, or dronedarone. Dronedarone has fewer pulmonary effects but is less effective and contraindicated in some patients [^112JtXW1].

---

Amiodarone is effective for AF rhythm control but carries a **meaningful risk of pulmonary toxicity** [^113brkQ5]. Risk is dose-related and higher with pre-existing lung disease, older age, and perioperative use; early detection via baseline and periodic imaging, with prompt drug cessation and corticosteroids, improves outcomes [^116pG2pV].

Amiodarone during pregnancy — risk profile and limited role; while amiodarone is an effective antiarrhythmic for many arrhythmias, it is associated with a risk of fetal abnormalities, with up to 17% of neonates developing hypothyroidism and some evidence of neurotoxicity; thus, use of amiodarone is generally limited to instances of refractory or life-threatening arrhythmias that cannot be controlled with other medications and requires close monitoring for potential side effects, and shared decision-making with the mother in advance of therapy initiation includes discussion of potential long-term risks to mother and fetus.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of amiodarone hydrochloride IV (also known as Pacerone, Nexterone):
- **Cardiac toxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone can exacerbate arrhythmias or cause new VF, incessant VT, increased resistance to cardioversion, and polymorphic VT associated with QT prolongation. Initiate amiodarone in a setting where continuous ECG and cardiac resuscitation are available. Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia before initiating treatment.
- **Hepatotoxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of hepatotoxicity. Obtain baseline and periodic liver transaminases. Discontinue or reduce dose if transaminases exceed three times normal or doubles in a patient with an elevated baseline.
- **Pulmonary toxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of pulmonary toxicity, particularly hypersensitivity pneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, and interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis. Cases of postoperative adult respiratory distress syndrome have also been reported. Obtain a baseline CXR and pulmonary function tests, including diffusion capacity, when amiodarone is initiated. Repeat history, physical examination, and CXR every 3–6 months.

5.1 Persistence of Adverse Effects

Because of the long half-life of amiodarone (15 to 142 days) and its active metabolite desethylamiodarone (14 to 75 days), adverse reactions and drug interactions can persist for several weeks following amiodarone discontinuation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

5.2 Pulmonary Toxicity

Pacerone may cause a clinical syndrome of cough and progressive dyspnea accompanied by functional, radiographic, gallium-scan, and pathological data consistent with pulmonary toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity secondary to Pacerone may result from either indirect or direct toxicity as represented by hypersensitivity pneumonitis (including eosinophilic pneumonia) or interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis, respectively. Rates of pulmonary toxicity have been reported to be as high as 17% and is fatal in about 10% of cases. Obtain a baseline chest X-ray and pulmonary-function tests, including diffusion capacity, when Pacerone therapy is initiated. Repeat history, physical exam, and chest X-ray every 3 to 6 months or if symptoms occur. Consider alternative antiarrhythmic therapy if the patient experiences signs or symptoms of pulmonary toxicity. Prednisone 40 to 60 mg/day tapered over several weeks may be helpful in treating pulmonary toxicity.

Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)

Postoperatively, occurrences of ARDS have been reported in patients receiving amiodarone hydrochloride therapy who have undergone either cardiac or noncardiac surgery. Although patients usually respond well to vigorous respiratory therapy, in rare instances the outcome has been fatal.

5.3 Hepatic Injury

Asymptomatic elevations of hepatic enzyme levels are seen frequently, but Pacerone can cause life-threatening hepatic injury. Histology has resembled that of alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis. Obtain baseline and periodic liver transaminases. If transaminases exceed three times normal, or doubles in a patient with an elevated baseline, discontinue or reduce dose of Pacerone, obtain follow-up tests and treat appropriately.

### Role of amiodarone in the era of the implantable cardioverter defibrillator [^116zkZFK]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2003). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is one of the most frequently used antiarrhythmic drugs in clinical practice. In patients with atrial fibrillation, in whom rhythm control is judged desirable, amiodarone is the most effective therapy. Amiodarone effectively prevents atrial fibrillation and may improve quality of life, but there is no evidence that it decreases mortality or severe morbidity in atrial fibrillation. In patients at risk for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, amiodarone may decrease mortality to a small degree, but the evidence for this benefit is incomplete. Patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators frequently require antiarrhythmic drug therapy, especially to treat electrical storm. Amiodarone is useful in these patients; however, it may increase defibrillation thresholds in some patients. In patients with out-of-hospital DC shock-resistant VF, amiodarone is the most effective antiarrhythmic drug available to assist in resuscitation. Amiodarone is a complicated drug, and its optimal use requires careful patient surveillance with respect to potential adverse effects.

### Amiodarone-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome masquerading as acute heart failure [^114GaF3o]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Amiodarone use has been rarely associated with the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), usually in association with surgery or pulmonary angiography. In patients with preexisting left ventricular dysfunction, the diagnosis may be overlooked.

Case Report

A 92-year-old woman with a history of atrial fibrillation who was on low-dose amiodarone presented to the Emergency Department with sudden onset of shortness of breath. The patient was started on treatment for acute heart failure based on the physical examination and the elevated brain natriuretic peptide level. Despite adequate diuresis, the patient showed no improvement. A chest computed tomography scan revealed acute interstitial pneumonitis. The patient received corticosteroids due to suspected amiodarone-induced acute interstitial pneumonitis resulting in ARDS. She returned to her baseline activity within 2 weeks of the therapy.

Conclusion

Although rare, clinicians should be vigilant for amiodarone-induced acute interstitial pneumonitis resulting in ARDS, as delay in treatment may result in a high risk of mortality. In addition, the development of ARDS occurred in our patient in the absence of precipitating factors such as surgery or pulmonary angiography.

### Antiarrhythmic drugs-clinical use and clinical decision making: a consensus document from the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) working group on cardiovascular pharmacology, endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society (HRS), Asia-Pacific Heart Rhythm Society (APHRS) and international society of cardiovascular pharmacotherapy (ISCP) [^113tL3XX]. Europace (2018). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation rhythm control — amiodarone dosing, cautions, and adverse-effect monitoring: Amiodarone is dosed as 3 x 200 mg daily over 4 weeks, 2 x 200 mg another 4 weeks, then 200 mg daily, and should be discontinued in case of excessive QT prolongation (> 500 ms). Concomitant drug cautions include concomitant use with VKAs or digitalis (their dose should be reduced) and increased risk of myopathy when used with statins. The drug requires regular surveillance for liver, lung and thyroid toxicity, has AV nodal slowing properties, but should not be used as monotherapy for rate control, and QT prolongation is common, but very rarely associated with TdP (< 0.5%).

### Atrial arrhythmias after lung and heart-lung transplant: effects on short-term mortality and the influence of amiodarone [^115DXhKN]. The Journal of Heart and Lung Transplantation (2011). Low credibility.

Background

The incidence and effect of atrial fibrillation or flutter (AF) after lung transplant are variable. An effect of pharmacologic treatment on outcomes is undetermined.

Methods

One hundred thirty-seven consecutive lung or heart-lung transplant patients were reviewed retrospectively. Uni- and multivariate analyses were performed to determine statistically significant risk factors for AF and short-term mortality.

Results

AF occurred in 45.0% of patients within 26 days. By univariate analysis, male gender was predictive of AF (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.25, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21 to 4.20, p = 0.011). Mortality within 200 days occurred in 36 of 137 (22.6%) patients. Those with AF had higher mortality than those without AF (27 of 62 [43.5%] vs 9 of 75 [12%]; p < 0.0001). Twenty-four of the 38 (63.1%) patients treated with amiodarone died, whereas 3 of 26 (11.5%) patients treated without amiodarone died (p < 0.0001). Mortality was similar among patients without AF, and those with AF not receiving amiodarone (9 of 75 [12%] vs 3 of 26 [11.5%], p = 1.00). By multivariate analysis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR = 0.395, CI 0.175 to 0.892, p = 0.025), primary pulmonary hypertension (HR = 7.245, CI 1.89 to 27.84, p = 0.0039), and use of amiodarone (HR = 2.967, CI 1.187 to 7.415, p = 0.020) were associated with death. Amiodarone was shown to be a significant statistical moderator (p < 0.0001) and mediator (p < 0.001) of mortality in AF patients.

Conclusions

There was a high incidence of AF after lung or heart-lung transplant, and a significant increase in mortality in AF patients treated with amiodarone. In patients with severe lung pathology, amiodarone pulmonary toxicity may be more common than previously known, and may be a significant contributor to mortality. Amiodarone use should be restricted in the lung transplant patient population.

Regarding specific circumstances for atrial fibrillation, more specifically with respect to patients with HF (rate control), ACC/ACCP/AHA/HRS 2024 guidelines recommend to consider administering IV amiodarone for acute rate control in patients with AF and HF with rapid ventricular rates if β-blockers or CCBs are contraindicated or ineffective.

### Use of amiodarone for atrial fibrillation in patients with preexisting pulmonary disease in the AFFIRM study [^115aATjU]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

In the Atrial Fibrillation Follow-up Investigation of Rhythm Management study, preexisting pulmonary disease did not preclude the use of amiodarone. Preexisting pulmonary disease was associated with a higher risk of pulmonary death and had a higher risk of diagnosed amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. However, use of amiodarone in the presence of preexisting pulmonary disease did not increase pulmonary death and all-cause mortality rates. Cautious use of amiodarone to treat atrial fibrillation appears acceptable in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation, even if preexisting pulmonary disease is present.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Monitoring and dose adjustment when initiating antiarrhythmic therapy for atrial fibrillation — trans-telephonic monitoring or other methods of ECG surveillance may be used to monitor rhythm and conduction; the PR interval (when flecainide, propafenone, sotalol, or amiodarone are used), QRS duration (with flecainide or propafenone), and QT interval (with dofetilide, sotalol, or amiodarone) should be measured; antiarrhythmic drugs should be started at a relatively low dose and titrated based on response with the ECG reassessed after each dose change; heart rate should be monitored at approximately weekly intervals; the dose of other rate-control medication should be reduced when the rate slows after initiation of amiodarone and stopped if it slows excessively; concomitant drug therapies should be monitored closely, and the doses of digoxin and warfarin should usually be reduced upon initiation of amiodarone due to anticipated rises in serum digoxin levels and INR.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Coronary artery disease with atrial fibrillation — antiarrhythmic selection emphasizes beta blockers first, sotalol preference, and cautious use of other agents. In stable coronary artery disease (CAD), beta blockers may be considered first but supporting evidence is limited to 2 studies, and efficacy for maintaining sinus rhythm after cardioversion of persistent AF is not convincing. When additional therapy is needed, sotalol has substantial beta-blocking activity and may be the preferred initial antiarrhythmic agent in ischemic heart disease due to less long-term toxicity than amiodarone. Amiodarone increases the risk of bradyarrhythmia requiring permanent pacemaker implantation in elderly AF patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI) but may be preferred over sotalol in patients with heart failure (HF). Neither flecainide nor propafenone is recommended; quinidine, procainamide, and disopyramide may be considered as third-line choices. Regarding dofetilide, post-MI data from DIAMOND-MI support a second-line role, whereas in CAD without MI or HF it remains uncertain whether benefits outweigh risk and more experience is needed before it can be recommended even as second line.

PACES/HRS consensus — amiodarone for rhythm control in adults with CHD emphasizes effectiveness but significant toxicities: Amiodarone is the most effective antiarrhythmic agent for maintaining sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation and is the drug of choice in the setting of heart failure, yet long-term therapy is limited by time- and dose-dependent side effects including pulmonary and liver toxicity, corneal microdeposits, photosensitivity, thyroid dysfunction, and adverse cardiac effects; amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis is especially common in women with CHD and in those with a body mass index < 21 kg/m². While respecting precautions, amiodarone may be considered a first-line antiarrhythmic agent for long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm in adults with CHD and IART or atrial fibrillation when ventricular hypertrophy or dysfunction, or coronary artery disease, is present, and in the absence of such coexisting conditions it is best reserved as a second-line agent.

### A multicenter retrospective cohort study on predicting the risk for amiodarone pulmonary toxicity [^116Ar6hj]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Amiodarone is one of the most commonly used anti-arrhythmic agents. Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity is a potentially fatal adverse effect associated with amiodarone use. Previous studies on the epidemiology and risk factors for amiodarone pulmonary toxicity showed diverse results.

Methods

A multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted to identify clinic-epidemiologic markers associated with amiodarone pulmonary toxicity for development of a prediction rule. Patients taking amiodarone who were managed in 3 centres in Hong Kong from 2005 to 2015 were included in this study. Penalized logistic regression was used to model the outcome as it is rare.

Results

A total of 34 cases with amiodarone pulmonary toxicity were identified among 1786 patients taking amiodarone for at least 90 days from 2005 to 2015. The incidence of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity was estimated to be 1.9%. The risk factors for amiodarone pulmonary toxicity included advanced age (OR 1.047, 95% CI 1.010–1.085, p = 0.013), ventricular arrhythmia (OR 2.703, 95% CI 1.053–6.935, p = 0.039), underlying lung disease (OR 2.511, 95% CI 1.146–5.501, p = 0.021) and cumulative dose of amiodarone (OR 4.762, 95% CI 1.310–17.309 p = 0.018).

Conclusions

The incidence of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity in Chinese patients in Hong Kong is estimated to be 1.9% in this study. Age, underlying lung disease, ventricular arrhythmia and cumulative dose of amiodarone are associated with the development of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity. A prediction rule was developed to inform the risk of developing amiodarone pulmonary toxicity.

### Diffuse alveolar damage in a patient receiving dronedarone [^1144vEzq]. Chest (2015). Low credibility.

Dronedarone is an amiodarone-like antiarrhythmic with a modified structure. The addition of a methyl sulfonyl group theoretically reduces the toxicity of amiodarone, specifically, adverse thyroid and pulmonary effects. Although animal studies have implicated dronedarone as a cause of lung injury, to date controlled trials in humans have not demonstrated an association. A 68-year-old woman developed a dry cough and worsening respiratory distress after receiving dronedarone for 6 months. Discontinuation of dronedarone therapy and subsequent steroid therapy led to a dramatic improvement of symptoms. Dronedarone may be associated with interstitial lung disease. We believe that patients receiving dronedarone should have their diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide and lung volumes monitored prior to initiation of therapy and frequently thereafter.

### Diagnosis of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity with high-resolution computerized tomographic scan [^117EwCpK]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2001). Low credibility.

Introduction

Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity is a serious adverse effect that can be fatal. The diagnosis is difficult due to the nonspecificity of symptoms, clinical findings, and test results. Because of its high iodine content, amiodarone deposition can be detected by sensitive high-resolution computed tomographic (CT) scan techniques. We hypothesized that pulmonary toxicity can be diagnosed more readily when these scans indicate the presence of increased attenuation of either pleural or pulmonary densities representing high iodine amiodarone deposits.

Methods and Results

This case control study included 16 patients taking chronic amiodarone. Eight cases presented with severe respiratory and other symptoms and were matched with 8 controls, 4 with mild or chronic respiratory symptoms. All patients underwent high-resolution CT of the chest. All cases had positive CT scan results demonstrating bilateral air-space disease, parenchymal bands, and thickened septal and bronchiolitis obliterans. All minimally or asymptomatic patients had negative scans with no area of high attenuation. All cases had ≥ 1 lesion with high-attenuation density. The cases were treated successfully by supportive care, discontinuation of amiodarone, and, rarely, corticosteroid therapy. Two cases had delayed diagnosis of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity and were managed successfully only after CT.

Conclusion

High-resolution CT may be a valuable noninvasive test to aid in the diagnosis of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity in symptomatic patients.

Amiodarone — evidence for conversion of persistent atrial fibrillation includes the following: In the SAFE‑T trial of persistent AF, conversion occurred in 27% after 28 d with amiodarone versus 24% with sotalol and 0.8% with placebo. Oral amiodarone is associated with a conversion rate between 15% and 40% over a period of 28 d. In a comparative study, amiodarone and propafenone showed similar rates (40%) in persistent AF averaging 5 mo in duration, and all amiodarone conversions occurred after 7 d, with responses between 1 and 14 d. Reported adverse effects include bradycardia, hypotension, visual disturbances, thyroid abnormalities, nausea, constipation, phlebitis with peripheral IV administration, and serious toxicity including death due to bradycardia ending in cardiac arrest.

### Pulmonary toxicity in patients receiving low-dose amiodarone [^1168SKKN]. Chest (2003). Low credibility.

Rationale

Although there have been reports of pulmonary toxicity with low-dose amiodarone, it is generally believed that low-dose therapy is safe.

Methods

The clinical data for eight patients identified from a retrospective chart review are presented.

Results

All of the patients were receiving amiodarone, 200 mg/d, for an average of 2 years. The average age was 77 years (range, 65 to 89 years). Seven of the eight patients were male. Seven of the eight patients presented with dyspnea on exertion, and three of the eight patients presented with cough. All of the patients had a clinical diagnosis of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity. Open-lung biopsies were obtained on two patients that were consistent with amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity. None of the patients were in congestive heart failure. Treatment involved cessation of amiodarone. In addition, three patients received corticosteroids. Five of the patients improved symptomatically with this conservative approach, and four patients improved radiographically. One patient died with progressive respiratory insufficiency (presumably from amiodarone pulmonary toxicity). One patient was unavailable for follow-up.

Conclusion

Amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity can occur at a daily dose of 200 mg. Clinicians must remain alert to this possibility even with this low-dose therapy.

### Amiodarone hydrochloride [^116pG2pV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1 Persistence of Adverse Effects

Because of the long half-life of amiodarone (15 to 142 days) and its active metabolite desethylamiodarone (14 to 75 days), adverse reactions and drug interactions can persist for several weeks following amiodarone discontinuation [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

5.2 Pulmonary Toxicity

Amiodarone hydrochloride may cause a clinical syndrome of cough and progressive dyspnea accompanied by functional, radiographic, gallium-scan, and pathological data consistent with pulmonary toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity secondary to amiodarone hydrochloride may result from either indirect or direct toxicity as represented by hypersensitivity pneumonitis (including eosinophilic pneumonia) or interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis, respectively. Rates of pulmonary toxicity have been reported to be as high as 17% and is fatal in about 10% of cases. Obtain a baseline chest X-ray and pulmonary-function tests, including diffusion capacity, when amiodarone hydrochloride therapy is initiated. Repeat history, physical exam, and chest X-ray every 3 to 6 months or if symptoms occur. Consider alternative antiarrhythmic therapy if the patient experiences signs or symptoms of pulmonary toxicity. Prednisone 40 to 60 mg/day tapered over several weeks may be helpful in treating pulmonary toxicity.

Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)

Postoperatively, occurrences of ARDS have been reported in patients receiving amiodarone hydrochloride therapy who have undergone either cardiac or noncardiac surgery. Although patients usually respond well to vigorous respiratory therapy, in rare instances the outcome has been fatal.

5.3 Hepatic Injury

Asymptomatic elevations of hepatic enzyme levels are seen frequently, but amiodarone hydrochloride can cause life-threatening hepatic injury. Histology has resembled that of alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis. Obtain baseline and periodic liver transaminases. If transaminases exceed three times normal, or doubles in a patient with an elevated baseline, discontinue or reduce dose of amiodarone hydrochloride, obtain follow-up tests and treat appropriately.

### Using oral amiodarone safely [^111wLztb]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2003). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is licensed for the treatment of severe cardiac rhythm disorders where other treatments either cannot be used or have failed. Because of safety concerns, the summary of product characteristics (SPC) recommends that amiodarone "should be initiated and normally monitored only under hospital or specialist supervision". However, the responsibility for prescribing and monitoring maintenance therapy often falls to non-specialists. Here, we discuss safety issues relating to the long-term use of oral amiodarone in adults.

### Postoperative atrial fibrillation prophylaxis after lung surgery: systematic review and meta-analysis [^116aZJTZ]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation after thoracic surgery is frequent and increases morbidity and mortality. A number of trials have investigated medical prophylaxis for the prevention of atrial fibrillation after surgery for lung cancer. However, the literature is diverse and hence difficult to review. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of reducing the risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation by the use of medical prophylaxis in patients undergoing surgery for lung cancer.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials investigating prophylactic medical interventions to reduce the risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation was performed.

Results

A total number of 10 trials were identified. A significant reduction in the risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation was found with a relative risk of 0.53 (95% confidence interval, 0.42 to 0.67) and a number needed-to-treat of 8.5 (95% confidence interval, 6.4 to 13.3). Amiodarone was found to be the most effective prophylactic agent with a relative risk of 0.32 (95% confidence interval, 0.19 to 0.50) and a number needed-to-treat of 4.8 (95% confidence interval, 3.7 to 7.6) and regarded as safe, with no severe adverse events registered. The risk of atrial fibrillation was overall reduced from 25.1% to 13.4% (p < 0.001) and for amiodarone as a single therapy from 30.4% to 9.6% (p < 0.001).

Conclusions

Medical prophylaxis with calcium-channel blockers, magnesium sulfate, or amiodarone significantly reduces the risk of developing atrial fibrillation after lung reduction surgery. However, amiodarone and magnesium sulfate were the most effective and safest drugs causing no increased risk of adverse events.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^116Bc6mg]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Amiodarone — thyroid, hepatic, pulmonary, ocular, neurologic, and proarrhythmic safety are characterized as follows: Amiodarone contains 37% iodine by weight and is associated with thyroid abnormalities in 2% to 24% of patients, with median time to amiodarone-induced hypothyroidism of 183 days and hyperthyroidism of 720 days. Amiodarone may cause pulmonary toxicity, most commonly interstitial lung disease or hypersensitivity syndrome, in 1% to 2% of patients and is fatal in approximately 10% of cases; a chest x-ray is recommended at baseline and when there is clinical suspicion for pulmonary toxicity, and a chest CT scan can be helpful for diagnosis in patients with unexplained cough and dyspnea. Corneal microdeposits are common but visual abnormalities and light sensitivity are rare, and an ophthalmologic examination is reasonable only if visual abnormalities develop. Amiodarone has been associated with neurological toxicity, particularly peripheral neuropathy, and oral amiodarone may cause torsades de pointes with one analysis estimating the incidence to be 0.7%.

### Acute amiodarone pulmonary toxicity [^115xT76f]. Journal of Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia (2021). Medium credibility.

Amiodarone is an effective antiarrhythmic that frequently is used during the perioperative period. Amiodarone possesses a significant adverse reaction profile. Amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity (AIPT) is among the most serious adverse effects and is a leading cause of death associated with its use. Despite significant advances in the understanding of AIPT, its etiology and pathogenesis remain incompletely understood. The diagnosis of AIPT is one of exclusion. The clinical manifestations of AIPT are categorized broadly as acute, subacute, and chronic. Acute AIPT is a rarer and more aggressive form of the disease, most often encountered in cardiothoracic surgery. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the predominating pattern of amiodarone's acute pulmonary toxicity. The incidence, risk factors, pathogenesis, and diagnosis of acute AIPT are speculative. Early cardiothoracic literature investigating AIPT often attributed amiodarone to the development of postoperative ARDS. Subsequent studies have found no association between amiodarone and acute AIPT and ARDS development. As a drug that is frequently prescribed to a patient population deemed most at risk for this fatal disease, the conflicting evidence on acute AIPT needs further investigation and clarification.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — antiarrhythmic agents used for rate control emphasize amiodarone's conditional role and toxicity, and limitations of other agents. Amiodarone is effective for controlling the ventricular rate in patients with AF, but although intravenous amiodarone is generally well tolerated in critically ill patients, efficacy has not been sufficiently evaluated in this indication; amiodarone is considered a suitable alternative agent when conventional measures are ineffective, and may be considered as an alternative with off-label use in the United States and potential toxicity that must be carefully weighed, with adverse effects making it a second-line therapy. High-dose oral amiodarone loading can worsen hemodynamics in recent decompensated HF or hypotension, and amiodarone may cause potentially fatal toxicity including pulmonary fibrosis, hepatic injury, and proarrhythmia; dofetilide and ibutilide are not effective for control of the ventricular rate, and propafenone is seldom sufficient so other agents are generally required when AF recurs.

### Meta-analysis comparing the relative risk of adverse events for amiodarone versus placebo [^1128FiHz]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Amiodarone has been associated with adverse events that may restrict its use. We performed a meta-analysis of placebo-controlled trials to assess the relative risk of adverse events of amiodarone compared with placebo. In total, 43 randomized trials were included. A total of 11,395 patients were included (5,792 patients randomized to amiodarone and 5,603 patients randomized to placebo). The incident rate of adverse events per 10,000 person-years was higher in the amiodarone group compared with placebo for pulmonary (129 vs 74; relative risk (RR) 1.77, p = 0.002), thyroid (201 vs 42; RR 4.44, p < 0.001), hepatic (54 vs 25; RR 2.27, p = 0.01), cardiac (771 vs 450; RR 1.94, p < 0.001), neurological (140 vs 76; RR 1.93, p < 0.001), and skin (81 vs 23; RR 1.99, p = 0.04) adverse events. Low-dose amiodarone was not associated with statistically significant increase in pulmonary adverse events but was still associated with thyroid and liver adverse events. In conclusion, the likelihood of experiencing adverse events related to amiodarone was higher than that of placebo. The overall rate of adverse events however, was low, and severe adverse events were rare.

### Risk of thromboembolism in heart failure: an analysis from the sudden cardiac death in heart failure trial (SCD-HeFT) [^113z2q4K]. Circulation (2007). Low credibility.

Background

In patients with heart failure, rates of clinically apparent stroke range from 1.3% to 3.5% per year. Little is known about the incidence and risk factors in the absence of atrial fibrillation. In the Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial (SCD-HeFT), 2521 patients with moderate heart failure were randomized to receive amiodarone, implanted cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), or placebo.

Methods and Results

We determined the incidence of stroke or peripheral or pulmonary embolism in patients with no history of atrial fibrillation (n = 2114), predictors of thromboembolism and the relationship to left ventricular ejection fraction. Median follow-up was 45.5 months. Kaplan-Meier estimates (95% CIs) for the incidence of thromboembolism by 4 years were 4.0% (3.0% to 4.9%), with 2.6% (1.1% to 4.1%) in patients randomized to amiodarone, 3.2% (1.8% to 4.7%) in patients randomized to ICD, and 6.0% (4.0% to 8.0%) in patients randomized to placebo (approximate rates of 0.7%, 0.8%, and 1.5% per year, respectively). By multivariable analysis, hypertension (P = 0.021) and decreasing left ventricular ejection fraction (P = 0.023) were significant predictors of thromboembolism; treatment with amiodarone or ICD treatment was a significant predictor of thromboembolism-free survival (P = 0.014 for treatment effect; hazard ratio [95% CI] versus placebo, 0.57 [0.33 to 0.99] for ICD; 0.44 [0.24 to 0.80] for amiodarone). Inclusion of atrial fibrillation during follow-up in the multivariable model did not affect the significance of treatment assignment as a predictor of thromboembolism.

Conclusions

In the SCD-HeFT patient cohort, which reflects contemporary treatment of patients with moderately symptomatic systolic heart failure, patients experienced thromboembolism events at a rate of 1.7% per year without antiarrhythmic therapy. Those treated with amiodarone or ICDs had lower risk of thromboembolism than those given placebo. Hypertension at baseline and lower ejection fraction were independent predictors of risk.

### 2023 ACC / AHA / ACCP / HRS guideline for the diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^113brkQ5]. Circulation (2024). High credibility.

Atrial fibrillation — amiodarone superiority and adverse effects: Multiple randomized trials show amiodarone is effective for maintenance of sinus rhythm and superior to other agents. In SAFE‑T, amiodarone was superior to sotalol and placebo for median time to AF recurrence (487 versus 74 versus 6 days, respectively; P < 0.001). In CTAF, AF recurrence at 16 months was 35% with amiodarone versus 63% with combined propafenone or sotalol (P < 0.001). The adverse‑effect profile is described as onerous, including pulmonary fibrosis, thyroid dysfunction, elevated transaminases, hepatotoxicity, photosensitivity, skin pigmentation changes, peripheral neuropathy, sinus bradycardia, QT prolongation with torsades de pointes, corneal microdeposits, and rarely optic neuropathy, with many clinically relevant drug interactions; therefore, amiodarone is best reserved for patients who do not respond to other recommended antiarrhythmic agents or for whom other antiarrhythmic drugs are contraindicated.

### Practical management guide for clinicians who treat patients with amiodarone [^115ZRH51]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Amiodarone, an iodinated benzofuran derivative with Class I, II, III, and IV antiarrhythmic properties, is the most commonly used antiarrhythmic drug used to treat supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. Appropriate use of this drug, with its severe and potentially life-threatening adverse effects, requires an essential understanding of its risk-benefit properties in order to ensure safety. The objective of this review is to afford clinicians who treat patients receiving amiodarone an appropriate management strategy for its safe use. The authors of this consensus management guide have thoroughly reviewed and evaluated the existing literature on amiodarone and apply this information, along with the collective experience of the authors, in its development. Provided are management guides on the intravenous and oral dosing of amiodarone, appropriate outpatient follow-up of patients taking the drug, its recognized adverse effects, and recommendations on when to consult specialists to help in patient management. All clinicians must be cognizant of the appropriate use, follow-up, and adverse reactions of amiodarone. The responsibility incurred by those treating such patients cannot be overemphasized.

### Amiodarone hydrochloride [^115LV6Pr]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: PULMONARY, HEPATIC and CARDIAC TOXICITY

Amiodarone hydrochloride is intended for use only in patients with the indicated life-threatening arrhythmias because its use is accompanied by substantial toxicity [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Amiodarone hydrochloride can cause pulmonary toxicity (hypersensitivity pneumonitis or interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis) that has resulted in clinically manifest disease at rates as high as 17% in some series of patients. Pulmonary toxicity has been fatal about 10% of the time. Obtain a baseline chest X-ray and pulmonary-function tests, including diffusion capacity, when amiodarone hydrochloride therapy is initiated. Repeat history, physical exam, and chest X-ray every 3 to 6 months [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Amiodarone hydrochloride can cause hepatoxicity, which can be fatal. Obtain baseline and periodic liver transaminases and discontinue or reduce dose if the increase exceeds three times normal, or doubles in a patient with an elevated baseline. Discontinue amiodarone hydrochloride if the patient experiences signs or symptoms of clinical liver injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Amiodarone hydrochloride can exacerbate arrhythmias. Initiate amiodarone hydrochloride in a clinical setting where continuous electrocardiograms and cardiac resuscitation are available [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

WARNING: PULMONARY, HEPATIC, and CARDIAC TOXICITY

### Use of amiodarone after major lung resection [^115Kgd6A]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2014). Low credibility.

Background

We evaluated the association of respiratory complications and amiodarone use in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) after major lung resection.

Methods

Outcomes of patients who had postoperative AF treated with or without amiodarone after lobectomy, bilobectomy, or pneumonectomy at a single institution between 2003 and 2010 were evaluated using multivariable logistic modeling.

Results

Of 1,412 patients who underwent lobectomy, bilobectomy, or pneumonectomy, AF occurred in 232 (16%). Atrial fibrillation developed after a respiratory complication in 31 patients, who were excluded from subsequent analysis. The remaining 201 patients who had AF without an antecedent respiratory complication had similar mortality (3.0% [6 of 201] vs 2.5% [30 of 1,180], p = 0.6) and respiratory morbidity (10% [20 of 201] vs 9% [101 of 1,180], p = 0.5) but longer hospital stays (5 [4 to 7] vs 4 days [3 to 6], p < 0.0001) compared with the 1,180 patients who did not have AF. Amiodarone was used in 101 (50%) of these 201 patients, including 5 patients who had a pneumonectomy. Age, pulmonary function, and operative resection were similar between the patients treated with and without amiodarone. Amiodarone use was not associated with a significant difference in the incidence of subsequent respiratory complications (12% [12 of 101 amiodarone patients] vs 8% [8 of 100 non-amiodarone patients], p = 0.5).

Conclusions

Atrial fibrillation that occurs without an antecedent respiratory complication in patients after major lung resection results in longer hospital stay but not increased mortality or respiratory morbidity. Using amiodarone to treat atrial fibrillation after major lung resection is not associated with an increased incidence of respiratory complications.

### Cost-effectiveness of targeting patients undergoing cardiac surgery for therapy with intravenous amiodarone to prevent atrial fibrillation [^114fjHMG]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of administering prophylactic intravenous (IV) amiodarone therapy to patients undergoing cardiac surgery according to their predicted risk of postoperative atrial fibrillation.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common complication of cardiovascular surgery that is associated with a significant increase in hospitalization costs. Intravenous amiodarone has been shown to decrease the incidence of postoperative AF.

Methods

All 8,709 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), 1,217 patients who underwent valve replacement and 624 patients who underwent CABG and valve replacement procedures (CABG + valve) from January 1, 1994, to June 30, 1999, at Emory University Hospitals were studied. Models predicting the risk of AF were developed using logistic regression; linear regression was used to estimate the influence of AF on hospitalization costs. Cost-effectiveness was evaluated for patient subsets identified according to their predicted risk of AF.

Results

Postoperative AF rates were 17.7% for CABG, 24.6% for valve and 33.8% for CABG + valve. Using 5,000 dollars as an acceptable cost per episode of atrial fibrillation averted, prophylactic IV amiodarone in CABG patients was not found to be cost-effective. Therapy would be recommended for roughly 5% of valve patients with a predicted risk of atrial fibrillation > 45%, and roughly two thirds of CABG + valve patients who have a predicted risk of > 30%.

Conclusions

Cost-effectiveness of prophylactic IV amiodarone varies according to type of surgery and the predicted risk of atrial fibrillation. Older patients undergoing valve replacement, particularly those with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and those undergoing concomitant CABG are likely to be the most appropriate candidates for IV amiodarone therapy in the perioperative period.

### Amiodarone for the prevention of sudden cardiac death: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^114Pnnxa]. European Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Aims

Not all patients at risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD) are eligible for, or have access to implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation. There are conflicting data regarding the efficacy and safety of amiodarone for the prevention of SCD.

Methods and Results

We conducted a meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials examining the use of amiodarone vs. placebo/control for the prevention of SCD. We identified 15 trials, which randomized 8522 patients to amiodarone or placebo/control. Amiodarone decreased the incidence of SCD [7.1 vs. 9.7%; OR 0.71 (0.61–0.84), P < 0.001] and cardiovascular death (CVD) [14.0 vs. 16.3%; OR 0.82 (0.71–0.94), P = 0.004]. There was a 1.5% absolute risk reduction in all-cause mortality which did not meet statistical significance (P = 0.093). Amiodarone therapy increased the risk of pulmonary [2.9 vs. 1.5%; OR 1.97, (1.27–3.04), P = 0.002], and thyroid [3.6 vs. 0.4%; OR 5.68, (2.94–10.98), P < 0.001] toxicity.

Conclusion

Amiodarone reduces the risk of SCD by 29% and CVD by 18%, and therefore, represents a viable alternative in patients who are not eligible for or who do not have access to ICD therapy for the prevention of SCD. However, amiodarone therapy is neutral with respect to all-cause mortality and is associated with a two- and five-fold increased risk of pulmonary and thyroid toxicity.

### Is amiodarone an underrecognized cause of acute respiratory failure in the ICU? [^113k7EEv]. Chest (2001). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is a commonly used anti-arrhythmic agent, with well-recognized chronic toxicity. Less well known is amiodarone's potential to cause acute lung damage, which can be severe or, occasionally, life-threatening. Lungs that have already been exposed to physical insults, such as the lungs of patients undergoing cardiac surgery, are particularly susceptible to acute pulmonary toxicity (APT). Unfortunately, cardiac surgery is one of the clinical scenarios in which amiodarone is most commonly used. After reviewing the data, and even in the context of difficulties and discrepancies in the existing literature, we contend that there is sufficient evidence of amiodarone's potentially serious side-effect profile in surgical ICU patients to advise continued caution in its use with this severely ill patient group. We suggest that amiodarone has a potentially important, though underrecognized, role in inducing an APT/ARDS in some patients, such as those undergoing cardiac surgery. We also provide a hypothesis to explain the mechanism by which amiodarone causes lung damage.

### Amiodarone for atrial fibrillation… [^114wFord]. AAFP (2000). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is used for the treatment of atrial fibrillation in many European countries but is labeled in the United States only for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. Its success in restoring a sinus rhythm has been inconsistent in clinical trials, with success rates ranging from 16 to 92 percent. In addition, concerns exist about the toxicity of amiodarone. Vardas and colleagues performed a prospective, randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of amiodarone in the treatment of atrial fibrillation of long or short duration. It was then given orally, 600 mg daily in three divided doses, for one week, followed by 400 mg daily for three weeks. If the patient had not previously received digoxin, digoxin was also administered during the first 24 hours. Anticoagulation was continued for 21 days after cardioversion. Patients were hospitalized for at least the first three days of treatment and were reevaluated after 30 days of therapy.

One-dimensional and two-dimensional echocardiography was performed either 24 hours after conversion or at the end of the study. Twelve patients who received amiodarone became hypotensive during the infusion and 17 developed phlebitis at the infusion site. Cessation of therapy because of adverse effects was not required in any of the patients. The authors conclude that amiodarone is a safe and effective method for termination of atrial fibrillation. While the conversion rate was generally high following administration of amiodarone, it fell to a relatively low level in patients with a very large left atrium or with chronic fibrillation. The conversion rate in patients with a large left atrium was 61 percent, and it was 34. 6 percent in those with chronic atrial fibrillation. The authors believe amiodarone could be a drug of first choice for atrial fibrillation, unless rapid conversion is needed.

editor's note: This is the most convincing study to date regarding the use of amiodarone for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. One confounder of this study is that all patients were given digoxin, including acutely in some patients. The risk of toxicity, such as cataract formation and pulmonary fibrosis, with long-term amiodarone therapy makes many clinicians hesitant to use this drug on a long-term basis.

### Atrial fibrillation after pulmonary transplantation: incidence, impact on mortality, treatment effectiveness, and risk factors [^1164q8za]. Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is common after thoracic surgery. Limited data exist concerning the incidence of AF, its impact on mortality, the effectiveness of therapy, and the risk factors of AF after pulmonary transplantation.

Methods and Results

We reviewed the medical files of 224 consecutive lung transplant recipients who underwent surgery over a 10-year period at a large Canadian center. We collected patient characteristics, in-hospital treatments, and outcomes. Time-to-event analysis was used to account for in-hospital follow-up and models generated to assess the impact of AF on mortality and independent risk factors of AF after transplantation. Postoperative AF occurred in 65 patients (29%). AF was more likely to occur with complications such as pneumonia, mediastinitis, and bronchial dehiscence and was not an independent risk factor of mortality (hazard ratio = 1.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.52–4.63). Pharmacological or electric therapy for rhythm or rate control of AF was administered to 97% of patients. Intravenous amiodarone was used in 46%, electric cardioversion in 28%, and heparin in 26%. Only 1 patient remained in AF at discharge. Age (hazard ratio = 1.08 by year; 95% confidence interval, 1.05–1.12), bilateral transplantation (hazard ratio = 1.87; 95% confidence interval, 1.03–3.42), and a history of AF before the transplantation (hazard ratio = 4.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.05–19.11) were found to be independently associated with an increased incidence of postoperative AF.

Conclusions

AF is fairly common after pulmonary transplantation, transient, and relatively benign. It is not independently associated with increased in-hospital mortality. Most patients return to sinus rhythm before discharge. Age, prior AF, and bilateral transplantation increase the risk of postoperative AF.

Table 2 — Mechanisms and implications of cardiovascular disease in COPD indicate that patients with COPD have certain phenotypes that tend to have more or less risk of cardiovascular disease in addition to the historical binary classification of "blue bloater" and "pink puffer"; cardiovascular events in patients with COPD increase with number of exacerbations and symptoms of breathlessness but not with FEV1; incident heart failure in patients with COPD is associated with a 3× increase in mortality at 1 yr; COPD promotes the occurrence of atrial fibrillation, progression, recurrence after cardioversion, reduced efficacy of catheter-based antiarrhythmia therapy, and worse outcomes; smoking, in addition to occupational exposures and lifestyle habits such as diet and exercise, is believed to be the common underlying cause of many of the comorbidities seen in COPD, including cardiovascular disease; the biological pathways underlying COPD and cardiovascular disease include inflammation (TNF-α, IL-6, CRP, fibrinogen, amyloid, surfactant) and accelerated aging (telomere shortening, cellular senescence, reduced cellular proliferation); the mechanisms underlying COPD and cardiovascular disease include oxidative stress, protein imbalance, elastin degradation, hypoxia/hypercapnia, endothelial dysfunction, atherothrombosis, and arterial stiffness; and COPD and cardiovascular treatments can have beneficial or detrimental cross-effects, including pulmonary toxicity from amiodarone.

PACES/HRS consensus — dronedarone in adults with CHD is cautioned against in specific populations: Dronedarone, an amiodarone analog without iodine, is less effective at maintaining sinus rhythm and has been associated with increased mortality related to worsening heart failure in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction; in patients > 65 years of age with at least a 6-month history of permanent atrial fibrillation and vascular risk factors, it was associated with increased rates of heart failure, stroke, and cardiovascular mortality. Rare cases of liver failure and pulmonary toxicity have been reported, and dronedarone is not recommended in patients with heart failure, moderate or severe systolic ventricular dysfunction, or moderate or complex CHD.

### The Society of Thoracic Surgeons practice guideline on the prophylaxis and management of atrial fibrillation associated with general thoracic surgery: executive summary [^116s5qgA]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

General thoracic surgery–associated atrial fibrillation — antiarrhythmic agent selection and contraindications are specified as follows: Flecainide should not be used in patients with any history of structural cardiac disease (Class III, Level of evidence A). Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity is emphasized, including reports during prolonged therapy that may occur in 1% to 10% of patients so treated and a fulminant, acute form during IV administration, with a prophylactic study after pneumonectomy noting ARDS (27%). Because of the possibility of amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity after pulmonary resection, the authors recommend flecainide or another agent for chemical cardioversion in patients who are mechanically ventilated, have severe COPD, or after pneumonectomy, and state that for patients with both structural heart disease and substantial pulmonary dysfunction, one of the other cardioverting drugs, electrical cardioversion, or simple anticoagulation therapy with rate control can be carried out.

### The Society of Thoracic Surgeons practice guideline on the prophylaxis and management of atrial fibrillation associated with general thoracic surgery: executive summary [^112DTDaf]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2011). Medium credibility.

Amiodarone prophylaxis — perioperative pulmonary toxicity signals and cautions are described as follows: Among pneumonectomy patients, the ARDS rate was 27%. Amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity appears to occur not only after chronic administration, but also occasionally after brief periods of IV administration or on the order of days, and acute pulmonary toxicity related to amiodarone appears most common perioperatively. Reported series include 3 of 8 patients with ARDS after cardiac surgery who received high-dose IV amiodarone therapy (1,200 mg for 7 days), with ARDS in 6 of 11 on long-term therapy, and another series with 4 of 33 after prolonged preoperative amiodarone. In contrast, trials using lower doses observed no increased pulmonary toxicity; the pulmonary resection series included 65 patients in the experimental arm, 25% of whom underwent pneumonectomy. The text advises that it should likely be avoided for patients with significant preexisting lung disease, those intubated or requiring high inspired oxygen concentrations, and those who have undergone pneumonectomy; it should also likely not be started preoperatively, and it is prudent, outside of studies, to limit the use of amiodarone for pulmonary resection patients to those in whom the risk is tolerable.

### Practical regimen for amiodarone use in preventing postoperative atrial fibrillation [^113XnhQz]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative atrial fibrillation occurs in 5% to 65% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Although postoperative atrial fibrillation is often regarded as a temporary, benign, operation-related problem, it is associated with a twofold to threefold increase in risk of adverse events, including permanent or transient stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and death.

Methods

This randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial included 250 eligible consecutively enrolled patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). They received 300 mg of amiodarone/placebo administered intravenously over 20 minutes on the first postoperative day and an oral dose of 600 mg of amiodarone or placebo twice daily for the first 5 postoperative days.

Results

The patients in amiodarone prophylaxis experienced a reduction in risk of atrial fibrillation of 14% (95% confidence interval [CI] 5.0% to 24%), with the number needed to treat at 6.9 (95% CI, 4.2 to 20), and the results for symptomatic atrial fibrillation showed a risk reduction of 18% (95% CI, 9.4% to 26), with the number needed to treat at 5.7 (95% CI, 3.9 to 11). Of the patients who developed atrial fibrillation in the placebo group, 84% experienced a symptomatic attack versus only 43% in the amiodarone group.

Conclusions

Postoperative prophylaxis with a high dose of oral amiodarone after an intravenous bolus infusion is a safe, practical, feasible, and effective regimen for CABG patients. It significantly diminishes the occurrence of postoperative atrial fibrillation.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Agents with proven efficacy to maintain sinus rhythm in atrial fibrillation (AF) — evidence summary and amiodarone: Thirty-six controlled trials evaluating 7 antiarrhythmic drugs for maintenance were identified, including 14 trials in paroxysmal AF and 22 trials in persistent AF. Available evidence suggests that amiodarone is more effective than either class I drugs, sotalol, or placebo for long-term maintenance in patients refractory to other drugs, but it is associated with a relatively high incidence of potentially severe extracardiac toxic effects, making it a second-line or last-resort agent in many cases. The use of low-dose amiodarone (200 mg daily or less) may be effective and associated with fewer side effects. In patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), heart failure (HF), coronary artery disease (CAD), and/or previous myocardial infarction (MI), amiodarone is associated with a low risk of proarrhythmia, making it an appropriate initial choice to prevent recurrent AF in these situations, and it provides the added benefit of effective rate control, frequently eliminating the need for other drugs to control the ventricular rate. In the CTAF trial context, a majority of the 403 patients had first-time paroxysmal (46%) or persistent (54%) AF of less than 6-month duration.

### Hepatic dysfunction and neurotoxicity in a patient receiving long-term low-dose amiodarone therapy [^116LPWDm]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Amiodarone is commonly used in the treatment of refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Much of the literature focuses on the toxic effects of this medication in the setting of rapid loading or long-term therapy with high maintenance doses. However, patients have been known to develop multi-organ toxicities with long-term low-dose therapy.

Case Report

We present a 90-year-old man with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation undergoing low-dose amiodarone therapy for a period of 18 months without medical follow-up who developed signs and symptoms consistent with neurotoxicity and hepatotoxicity in association with hyperammonemia. Upon discontinuation of the medication and treatment of the hyperammonemia, the patient had a rapid decline in symptoms and a return to his baseline status.

Conclusion

Identifying toxicity early and correcting it rapidly may prevent life-threatening sequelae associated with amiodarone toxicity.

ACC/AHA/HRS SVT guideline — Digoxin dosing, adverse effects, and cautions: Initial IV bolus is 0.25–0.5-mg; can repeat 0.25-mg IV bolus, up to maximum dose of 1.0 mg over 24 h (ie, maximum loading dose 8–12 mcg/kg), given at 6–8 h intervals; maintenance dose is based on patient factors (IV 2.4–3.6 mcg/kg/d). Adverse effects include anorexia, nausea, vomiting, visual changes, and cardiac arrhythmias if digoxin toxicity, associated with levels > 2 ng/mL (although symptoms may also occur at lower levels). Precautions include renal dysfunction, WPW with AF/atrial flutter, and AV block greater than first degree or SA node dysfunction (in absence of pacemaker). Digoxin is a P-glycoprotein substrate; with dronedarone reduce dose by at least 50% and with amiodarone reduce dose by 30%–50%; for verapamil, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, erythromycin, flecainide, itraconazole, posaconazole, propafenone, and voriconazole, monitor digoxin levels. A large retrospective study suggested an increased risk in mortality in patients who were treated with digoxin for newly diagnosed AF or atrial flutter; although the data were collected from a population that was different from SVT patients, digoxin should be used with caution.

### Amiodarone: guidelines for use and monitoring [^111SLjpo]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Amiodarone is a potent antiarrhythmic agent that is used to treat ventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation. The drug prevents the recurrence of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and produces a modest reduction of sudden deaths in high-risk patients. Amiodarone is more effective than sotalol or propafenone in preventing recurrent atrial fibrillation in patients for whom a rhythm-control strategy is chosen. When long-term amiodarone therapy is used, potential drug toxicity and interactions must be considered. The dosage of amiodarone should be kept at the lowest effective level. In patients who also are taking digoxin and warfarin, physicians must pay close attention to digoxin levels and prothrombin time, keeping in mind that the effects of interaction with amiodarone do not peak until seven weeks after the initiation of concomitant therapy. Laboratory studies to assess liver and thyroid function should be performed at least every six months.

### Pulmonary toxicity of amiodarone… [^114WMBm5]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

To the Editor. — The Editorial by Estes1 on the role of amiodarone for the management of atrial fibrillation describes several amiodarone dose-related adverse effects. However, we were surprised that there was no mention of pulmonary toxic effects, which are the most serious side effects, and which have an incidence estimated from 0. 5% to 10% and a mortality of 1% to 33%. 2 Although an immunologic mechanism may contribute, some findings argue for a toxic dose-dependent mechanism. 3Unfortunately, routine pulmonary function tests have not been useful to predict pulmonary side effects of amiodarone. 4 These effects have most frequently included diffuse interstitial pneumonitis, but cases presenting with segmental pulmonary consolidation, fatal respiratory distress syndrome, pulmonary fibrosis, and pleural effussion have also been described.

Circulation (2006). Medium credibility.

Hypertensive heart disease with atrial fibrillation — risk factors and drug choices are outlined. Hypertension is described as the most prevalent and potentially modifiable independent risk factor for development of AF and its complications. Patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) may face increased risk of torsades de pointes, so class IC agents and amiodarone are preferred over type IA and type III agents as first-line therapy; in the absence of ischemia or LVH, propafenone or flecainide is reasonable. Amiodarone prolongs the QT interval but has very low ventricular proarrhythmic risk; its extracardiac toxicity relegates it to second line unless there is substantial LVH, and when amiodarone and sotalol fail or are inappropriate, disopyramide, quinidine, or procainamide is a reasonable alternative. Beta blockers may be first-line to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with MI, HF, and hypertension, and patients with hypertension are more likely than those with lone AF to maintain sinus rhythm after cardioversion of persistent AF when treated with a beta blocker. Renin–angiotensin system modulation is supported: ACE inhibition was associated with lower AF incidence than calcium channel blockade during 4.5 y of follow-up in a cohort derived from a database of 8 million managed-care patients, and in hypertensive patients with ECG-documented LVH, losartan reduced new-onset AF and stroke versus atenolol with similar blood pressure reduction; the benefit of losartan was greater in patients with AF for both a primary composite endpoint and cardiovascular mortality alone.

5.6 Proarrhythmia

NEXTERONE Premixed Injection may cause a worsening of existing arrhythmias or precipitate a new arrhythmia, sometimes leading to fatal outcomes [see Adverse Reactions (6.2)]. Proarrhythmia, primarily torsade de pointes (TdP), has been associated with prolongation, by intravenous amiodarone. Although QTc prolongation occurred frequently in patients receiving intravenous amiodarone, TdP or new-onset VF occurred infrequently (less than 2%). Monitor patients for QTc prolongation during infusion with NEXTERONE Premixed Injection. Reserve the combination of amiodarone with other antiarrhythmic therapies that prolong the QTc to patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias who are incompletely responsive to a single agent.

Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia or hypocalcemia whenever possible before initiating treatment with NEXTERONE Premixed Injection, as these disorders can exaggerate the degree of QTc prolongation and increase the potential for TdP. Give special attention to electrolyte and acid-base balance in patients experiencing severe or prolonged diarrhea or in patients receiving concomitant diuretics and laxatives.

5.7 Pulmonary Injury

Early-onset Pulmonary Toxicity There have been postmarketing reports of acute-onset (days to weeks) pulmonary injury in patients treated with intravenous amiodarone. Findings have included pulmonary infiltrates and masses on X-ray, pulmonary fibrosis, bronchospasm, wheezing, fever, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and hypoxia. Two percent (2%) of patients were reported to have adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during clinical studies involving 48 hours of therapy.

Some cases have progressed to respiratory failure or death. Monitor for new respiratory symptoms and evaluate appropriately. Obtain a baseline chest X-ray and pulmonary function tests in patients who are expected to be receiving amiodarone chronically.

5.8 Loss of Vision

Cases of optic neuropathy and optic neuritis, usually resulting in visual impairment, have been reported in patients treated with oral amiodarone or intravenous amiodarone. In some cases, visual impairment has progressed to permanent blindness. Optic neuropathy and neuritis may occur at any time following initiation of therapy. Perform an ophthalmic examination if symptoms of visual impairment appear, such as changes in visual acuity and decreases in peripheral vision. Re-evaluate the necessity of amiodarone therapy if optic neuropathy or neuritis is suspected.

### Amiodarone and pulmonary toxicity in atrial fibrillation: a nationwide Israeli study [^117VVNw3]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Amiodarone-related interstitial lung disease (ILD) is the most severe adverse effect of amiodarone treatment. Most data on amiodarone-related ILD are derived from periods when amiodarone was given at higher doses than currently used.

Methods

A nationwide population-based study was conducted among patients with incident atrial fibrillation (AF) between 1 December 1999 and 31 December 31 2021. Amiodarone-exposed patients were matched 1:1 with controls unexposed to amiodarone based on age, sex, ethnicity, and AF diagnosis duration. The final patient cohort included only matched pairs where amiodarone therapy was consistent throughout follow-up. Directed acyclic graphs and inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) modelling were used. Patients with either prior ILD or primary lung cancer (PLC) were excluded. The primary outcome was the incidence of any ILD. Secondary endpoints were death and PLC.

Results

The final cohort included 6039 amiodarone-exposed patients who were matched with unexposed controls. The median age was 73.3 years, and 51.6% were women. After a mean follow-up of 4.2 years, ILD occurred in 242 (2.0%) patients. After IPTW, amiodarone exposure was not significantly associated with ILD [hazard ratio (HR): 1.45, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.97, 2.44, P = 0.09]. There was a trivial higher relative risk of ILD among amiodarone-exposed patients between Years 2 and 8 of follow-up [maximal risk ratio (RR): 1.019]. Primary lung cancer occurred in 97 (0.8%) patients. After IPTW, amiodarone was not associated with PLC (HR: 1.18, 95% CI: 0.76, 2.08, P = 0.53). All-cause death occurred in 2185 (18.1%) patients. After IPTW, amiodarone was associated with reduced mortality risk (HR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.60, 0.72, P < 0.001). The results were consistent across a variety of sensitivity analyses.

Conclusion

In a contemporary AF population, low-dose amiodarone was associated with a trend towards increased risk of ILD (15%-45%) but a clinically negligible change in absolute risk (maximum of 1.8%), no increased risk of PLC, and a lower risk of all-cause mortality.

### Amiodarone hydrochloride (Pacerone) [^112ce4FK]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Boxed warnings regarding the use of amiodarone hydrochloride PO (also known as Pacerone, Nexterone):
- **Cardiac toxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone can exacerbate arrhythmias or cause new VF, incessant VT, increased resistance to cardioversion, and polymorphic VT associated with QT prolongation. Initiate amiodarone in a setting where continuous ECG and cardiac resuscitation are available. Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and hypocalcemia before initiating treatment.
- **Hepatotoxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of hepatotoxicity. Obtain baseline and periodic liver transaminases. Discontinue or reduce dose if transaminases exceed three times normal or doubles in a patient with an elevated baseline.
- **Pulmonary toxicity**: maintain a high level of suspicion, as amiodarone has been associated with an increased risk of pulmonary toxicity, particularly hypersensitivity pneumonitis, eosinophilic pneumonia, and interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis. Cases of postoperative adult respiratory distress syndrome have also been reported. Obtain a baseline CXR and pulmonary function tests, including diffusion capacity, when amiodarone is initiated. Repeat history, physical examination, and CXR every 3–6 months.

### 2016 ACC / AHA clinical performance and quality measures for adults with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on performance measures [^112deQzU]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes (2016). Medium credibility.

Areas for further research — bleeding assessment, outcomes, special populations, and candidate concepts — state that "documentation of a bleeding score may be beneficial but that more data are needed before calculation of a bleeding score is advanced to the level of a performance or quality measure", and although the "2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation" references HAS-BLED, "no specific guideline recommendations are included with regard to bleeding risk assessment". The committee notes that "future research is needed to determine whether bleeding scores can lead to actionable risk stratification of patients" and that "there is insufficient evidence to support the use of an outcome measure (eg, stroke rate per capita) as a measure of quality of AF care". It also acknowledges "patients with adult congenital heart disease some of whom have residual atrial septal defects that may change the indication for anticoagulation" and that "these patients are not featured in the CHA2DS2-VASc" but "are at greater risk of stroke with atrial fibrillation". Additional concepts listed for exploration include "Shared decision making between the physician and patient on whether a rhythm or rate control strategy should be pursued", "Toxicity from amiodarone screening every 6 to 12 months", "Inappropriate use of anticoagulation in patients with extreme low risk of stroke (ie, CHA₂DS₂-VASc = 0)", "Prevention of re-occurrence of atrial fibrillation or flutter by controlling blood pressure in patients with hypertension", and "Exploring the feasibility of integration of pharmacokinetic guides for dose adjustments for new oral anticoagulants (eg renal conditions, or other conditions)".

### Amiodarone induced acute interstitial pneumonitis [^116doFQK]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Amiodarone has several potentially fatal toxicities, the most important of which is amiodarone pulmonary toxicity (APT). We report a rare case where a patient developed acute interstitial pneumonitis 2 days after starting amiodarone. This report reveals the potential for rapid onset of APT and will help to increase awareness among health care professionals who very often underestimate the incidence of the toxic effects of amiodarone. A simple, cost effective screening tool to detect APT in its early stage is recommended.

### Amiodarone therapy for atrial rhythm control: insights gained from a single center experience [^111JhZKr]. Journal of Cardiovascular Electrophysiology (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Amiodarone has been advocated as an effective "long-term" therapy for atrial rhythm control in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). We sought to assess the sustainability of this therapeutic strategy.

Methods and Results

Retrospective analysis of a consecutive, single-center cohort (n = 168) with symptomatic AF who were treated with amiodarone and followed for 3 years. The incidence of amiodarone cessation was evaluated at 1, 2, and 3 years and attributed principally to drug inefficacy, intolerance, or toxicity. A gradual diminution in the number of patients on therapy was observed, such that by 3 years, only 45% remained. This was attributable to inefficacy (25%), intolerance (12%), or toxicity (18%). Pulmonary toxicity was surprisingly common, occurring in at least 7% of patients.

Conclusions

These data challenge the notion of amiodarone as a reasonable "destination" therapy for AF.

### Amiodarone and cyclophosphamide: potential for enhanced lung toxicity [^115kqs3o]. Bone Marrow Transplantation (2001). Low credibility.

Antineoplastic therapy can be associated with drug-induced lung toxicity. With the increasing use of amiodarone for cardiac dysrhythmias there is an increasing possibility of its combined use with chemotherapies for various malignancies. We report a patient on long-term amiodarone who developed biopsy-proven drug-induced lung toxicity after receiving high-dose cyclophosphamide, at a time-frame much shorter than would have been predicted with cyclophosphamide alone. The potential for enhanced lung toxicity secondary to combination of amiodarone and cyclophosphamide is discussed.

### Oral amiodarone for recent-onset atrial fibrillation… [^1136qiSi]. AAFP (2025). Medium credibility.

Intravenous amiodarone is an effective antiarrhythmic agent that has resulted in good overall conversion rates when used to treat patients with atrial fibrillation. High-dose oral loading has been reported to suppress supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias within 24 hours after administration and, clinically, is relatively well tolerated. Peuhkurinen and associates evaluated the efficacy of a single oral dose of amiodarone versus placebo in patients with recent-onset AF. Patients with a history of acute myocardial infarction, acute pulmonary edema, known sick sinus syndrome, high-degree atrioventricular block, anemia, stroke, sepsis, known thyroid disease or severe renal or hepatic disease, those taking class III antiarrhythmics or sotalol, and women of child-bearing age were excluded. After 24 hours, the conversion rates were 87 percent in the Holter-monitored patients in the amiodarone group and 35 percent of patients in the placebo group.

No proarrhythmic event was observed in either group. Three patients in the amiodarone group had diarrhea compared with one in the control group. One patient who received amiodarone became bradycardic and hypotensive but recovered rapidly with administration of intravenous fluids. Overall, the number of adverse events was similar in both groups. Other clinical trials have shown the efficacy of antiarrhythmic medications in converting AF to sinus rhythm. Flecainide and propafenone, given as a single oral or intravenous dose, demonstrated efficacy in converting AF to sinus rhythm, although the safety of these agents is uncertain in patients with left ventricular dysfunction because of negative inotropic effects and increased mortality when used in patients with a history of acute myocardial infarction.

Intravenous amiodarone has been demonstrated to be relatively safe in patients with left ventricular dysfunction and acute myocardial infarction. In the acute setting, intravenous amiodarone seems to effectively lower the ventricular rate in patients who do not return to sinus rhythm. The authors conclude that 30 to 50 mg per kg of oral amiodarone is relatively well tolerated and efficacious in recent-onset AF.

### Application of dual energy CT in the diagnosis of amiodarone lung toxicity as a cause of lung mass [^111F3g48]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Diagnosis of amiodarone lung toxicity on computerized tomography (CT) can be challenging especially in the presence of mass-like consolidation. Additional causes of mass-like consolidation including malignancy and pneumonia should be excluded, sometimes requiring tissue sampling.

Case

Here we present a case of amiodarone lung toxicity, with diagnosis suspected based on patient's history of chronic cardiac disease, amiodarone treatment, and imaging characteristics. Evaluation with dual energy CT demonstrated high iodine content in the mass-like consolidation further supporting the diagnosis. Biopsy of the mass-like consolidation confirmed amiodarone toxicity.

Conclusion

Dual energy CT has potential utility in differentiating mass-like consolidation from other etiologies such as malignancy or pneumonia.

### Ifosfamide [^1157f32B]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

5.4 Cardiotoxicity

Ifosfamide for Injection can cause severe or fatal cardiotoxicity including any of the following:

Supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmias, including atrial/supraventricular tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, pulseless ventricular tachycardia
Decreased QRS voltage and ST‑segment or T‑wave changes
Toxic cardiomyopathy leading to heart failure with congestion and hypotension
Pericardial effusion, fibrinous pericarditis, and epicardial fibrosis

Cardiotoxic effects are dose‑dependent and the risk is increased in patients with cardiac disease, prior or concomitant treatment with other cardiotoxic agents, radiation of the cardiac region, and renal impairment.

5.5 Pulmonary Toxicity

Ifosfamide for Injection can cause severe or fatal pulmonary toxicities including interstitial pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, and respiratory failure. Monitor for signs and symptoms of pulmonary toxicity and treat as clinically indicated.

5.6 Secondary Malignancies

The incidence of secondary malignancies is increased in patients treated with Ifosfamide for Injection-containing regimens. Cases of myelodysplastic syndrome, acute leukemias, lymphomas, thyroid cancers, and sarcomas have occurred and may develop several years after chemotherapy has been discontinued.

5.7 Veno-occlusive Liver Disease

Veno-occlusive liver disease has been reported with chemotherapy that included ifosfamide.

### Amiodarone in the management of refractory atrial fibrillation… [^116ahXBy]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Thirty-eight patients were studied to evaluate amiodarone hydrochloride in the treatment of refractory atrial fibrillation. Among them were 25 with sustained atrial fibrillation and 13 with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. All patients were symptomatic and refractory to therapeutic doses of at least two conventional drug trials, and patients with atrial fibrillation had relapsed from electroversion. Amiodarone hydrochloride was administered in doses of 5 mg/kg intravenously, then 600 to 800 mg/d for seven to ten days, followed by 200 to 400 mg/d. Holter recordings were obtained every one to three months. The effect of amiodarone on the ventricular rate during sustained atrial fibrillation was evaluated in 18 patients and decreased from 99/min at baseline to 75/min at follow-up before conversion. Conversion to normal sinus rhythm occurred in 19 patients, including 11 with and eight without directcurrent cardioversion.

During long-term treatment, sinus rhythm was sustained on an average of 16 months in 20 patients. This included 11 of 25 patients with sustained atrial fibrillation and nine of 13 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, with only four of these patients relapsing. Four patients developed intolerable side effects, but no serious toxic effects were encountered, perhaps because of the relatively low doses of amiodarone hydrochloride that were used. Amiodarone is a safe and effective alternative to standard therapy in patients with refractory sustained or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Blevins RD, Kerin NZ, Benaderet D, et al.

### Combination of rivaroxaban and amiodarone increases bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation [^113DLqf1]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Rivaroxaban and amiodarone are commonly used for treating patients with atrial fibrillation. Drug-drug interactions between rivaroxaban and amiodarone may increase exposure to rivaroxaban. However, the clinical relevance of this drug-drug interaction is still not clear.

Objective

The aim was to investigate the risk of bleeding in patients receiving a combination of rivaroxaban and amiodarone.

Methods

This was a prospective observational study in which we included atrial fibrillation patients treated with rivaroxaban. The patients were divided into the rivaroxaban group and the combination of rivaroxaban and amiodarone group (the combination group). Propensity score matching (PSM) and inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) were performed to adjust between-group differences. The primary endpoint was defined as the time to the first occurrence of a composite of major, clinically relevant nonmajor, and minor bleeding.

Results

In total, 481 atrial fibrillation patients were included in the analysis. After PSM, 154 patients in the rivaroxaban group were matched with 154 patients in the combination group. The bleeding events mainly consisted of clinically relevant nonmajor and minor bleeding. Only one patient experienced major bleeding. The primary outcome was recorded in 26.0% of patients in the combination group and 10.4% of patients in the rivaroxaban group (hazard ratio = 2.76, 95% CI = 1.55–4.93, P < 0.001). The bleeding risk was significantly higher in the combination group compared with that in the rivaroxaban group in the IPTW and stabilized IPTW analyses (hazard ratio = 2.17, 95% CI = 1.32–3.56, P = 0.002).

Conclusion and Relevance

The combination of rivaroxaban and amiodarone increased the risk of bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation, especially clinically relevant nonmajor and minor bleeding. Physicians prescribing rivaroxaban and amiodarone together should be concerned about an increase in the risk of nonmajor bleeding.

### Amiodarone significantly decreases atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing surgery for lung cancer [^115AgKMn]. The Annals of Thoracic Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Postoperative atrial fibrillation occurs in 5% to 65% of patients undergoing thoracic surgery. Although postoperative atrial fibrillation often is regarded as a temporary, benign, operation-related problem, it is associated with a twofold to threefold increase in risk of adverse events, including transient or permanent stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and death.

Methods

A total of 254 consecutively eligible enrolled patients undergoing surgery for lung cancer were included in this randomized, controlled, double-blinded trial. Patients received 300 mg of amiodarone or placebo intravenously over 20 minutes immediately after surgery and an oral dose of 600 mg of amiodarone or placebo twice daily during the first 5 postoperative days.

Results

The patients in the amiodarone prophylaxis group had a reduction in the risk of atrial fibrillation of 23% (12 to 31); number needed to treat was 4.4 (3.1 to 7.8). A total of 38 in the control group and 11 in the amiodarone group experienced atrial fibrillation (p < 0.001). Adverse effects were observed in 10 patients equally distributed in both trial arms.

Conclusions

Postoperative prophylaxis with a high dose of oral amiodarone after an intravenous bolus infusion is a safe, practical, feasible, and effective regimen for patients with lung cancer undergoing surgery. It significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation.

### Monitoring amiodarone's toxicities: recommendations, evidence, and clinical practice [^111pMmxn]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2004). Low credibility.

Objectives

We sought to develop an explicit evidence-based model of medication monitoring and to evaluate monitoring practices and adverse drug events in patients taking amiodarone at one institution.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE (1966 through 2000) for English-language publications providing specific monitoring recommendations for amiodarone. A cross-sectional retrospective chart review of 99 outpatients receiving amiodarone therapy between Jan 1, 2000, and Jan 1, 2001, at a large tertiary-care hospital was performed to assess monitoring practices. Adverse drug events were identified by use of structured implicit reviews. The main outcome measure was the proportion of patients receiving the monitoring recommended in the literature and having amiodarone-related adverse drug events.

Results

Forty-three articles were identified that provided specific monitoring recommendations, although no studies were found that compared the outcomes of patients managed with different monitoring regimens. Overall, 70% of the recommended monitoring criteria were satisfied, although only 9 patients (9%; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 3%-15%) received all of the recommended monitoring. Variability in monitoring practices was identified at all stages of the monitoring model. Of the patients, 52 (52%; 95% CI, 42%-62%) received minimum baseline evaluations, 22 (22%; 95% CI, 14%-31%) underwent ongoing surveillance, 75 (75%; 95% CI, 61%-89%) had appropriate responses to abnormal surveillance results, and 71 (71%; 95% CI, 62%-80%) had timely follow-up visits. Of the patients, 8 (8%; 95% CI, 3%-13%) had 9 amiodarone-related adverse drug events, of which 3 were judged to be preventable. Interrater agreement for monitoring processes (kappa = 0.83) and adverse drug events (kappa = 0.67) was good.

Conclusions

Current standards for amiodarone toxicity monitoring are based on expert opinion with limited evidence to support most recommendations. Monitoring practices appear to vary significantly, with few patients receiving all of the recommended monitoring. Some amiodarone-related adverse drug events may be preventable and patient safety might be improved with a better understanding of monitoring processes.

### 2017 AHA / ACC / HRS guideline for management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias and the prevention of sudden cardiac death: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^1118wGhR]. Circulation (2018). Medium credibility.

Amiodarone for prevention of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in NICM — evidence from meta-analyses shows mixed efficacy and safety concerns. A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) included 15 studies with 8522 patients assigned to amiodarone or placebo/control and found that amiodarone reduced the risk of SCD by 29%; however, it did not reduce all-cause mortality and was associated with an increased risk of pulmonary and thyroid toxicity. Another meta-analysis found the evidence insufficient to support amiodarone's efficacy for reduction of SCD and all-cause mortality in survivors of cardiac arrest or those with syncope due to ventricular arrhythmia, and a VALIANT subgroup analysis found increased mortality in patients with NYHA class III HF on amiodarone. The text also notes that some high-risk patients do not meet ICD indications, such as those with class IV HF without CRT possibility or with a life expectancy < 1 year.

### Amiodarone-induced diffuse alveolar haemorrhage: a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of a commonly prescribed medication [^114pxAHM]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic agent that is used commonly in clinical practice. It is associated with many side effects, the most common being pulmonary manifestations. Interstitial pneumonitis is one of the most common complications, however rarely amiodarone can cause diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH) too. We describe the case of a 73-year-old woman who presented with shortness of breath and haemoptysis 4 days after starting amiodarone. She was diagnosed with amiodarone-induced DAH based on imaging and bronchoalveolar lavage. She was treated with intravenous and then oral steroids, and amiodarone was discontinued. The patient made a significant clinical and radiological recovery. She was discharged 10 days after her presentation. This case highlights a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of a commonly used medication.

### Nexterone (amiodarone hci) [^111rWaSP]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Correct hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia or hypocalcemia whenever possible before initiating treatment with NEXTERONE, as these disorders can exaggerate the degree of QTc prolongation and increase the potential for TdP. Give special attention to electrolyte and acid-base balance in patients experiencing severe or prolonged diarrhea or in patients receiving concomitant diuretics and laxatives.

Amiodarone causes thyroid dysfunction in some patients, which may lead to potentially fatal breakthrough or exacerbated arrhythmias.

5.5 Pulmonary Injury

Early-onset Pulmonary Toxicity

There have been postmarketing reports of acute-onset (days to weeks) pulmonary injury in patients treated with intravenous amiodarone. Findings have included pulmonary infiltrates and masses on X-ray, bronchospasm, wheezing, fever, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and hypoxia. Some cases have progressed to respiratory failure or death.

ARDS

Two percent (2%) of patients were reported to have adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during clinical studies involving 48 hours of therapy.

Pulmonary Fibrosis

There have been reports of early development of pulmonary fibrosis (within 1 to 3 months) following initiation of amiodarone treatment. Only 1 of more than 1000 patients treated with intravenous amiodarone in clinical studies developed pulmonary fibrosis. In that patient, the condition was diagnosed 3 months after treatment with intravenous amiodarone, during which time the patient received oral amiodarone. Pulmonary toxicity is a well-recognized complication of long-term amiodarone use (see package insert for oral amiodarone).

---

### Amiodarone hci [^113aWdh2]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

Postoperatively, occurrences of ARDS have been reported in patients receiving oral amiodarone therapy who have undergone either cardiac or noncardiac surgery. Although patients usually respond well to vigorous respiratory therapy, in rare instances the outcome has been fatal. Until further studies have been performed, it is recommended that FiO₂ and the determinants of oxygen delivery to the tissues (e.g. SaO₂, PaO₂) be closely monitored in patients on amiodarone.

Pulmonary Fibrosis

Only 1 of more than 1000 patients treated with amiodarone HCl injection in clinical studies developed pulmonary fibrosis. In that patient, the condition was diagnosed 3 months after treatment with amiodarone HCl injection, during which time she received oral amiodarone. Pulmonary toxicity is a well-recognized complication of long-term amiodarone use (see labeling for oral amiodarone).

Loss of Vision

Cases of optic neuropathy and/or optic neuritis, usually resulting in visual impairment, have been reported in patients treated with oral amiodarone. In some cases, visual impairment has progressed to permanent blindness. Amiodarone HCl injection is indicated for initiation of treatment and prophylaxis of frequently recurring ventricular fibrillation (VF) and hemodynamically unstable ventricular tachycardia (VT) in patients refractory to other therapy and can also be used to treat patients with VT/VF for whom oral amiodarone is indicated, but who are unable to take oral medication. Optic neuropathy and/or neuritis may occur at any time following initiation of therapy. A causal relationship to the drug has not been clearly established. If symptoms of visual impairment appear, such as changes in visual acuity and decreases in peripheral vision, prompt ophthalmic examination is recommended. Appearance of optic neuropathy and/or neuritis calls for re-evaluation of amiodarone therapy. The risks and complications of antiarrhythmic therapy with amiodarone must be weighed against its benefits in patients whose lives are threatened by cardiac arrhythmias. Regular ophthalmic examination, including fundoscopy and slit-lamp examination, is recommended during administrations of amiodarone (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

### 2015 ACC / AHA / HRS guideline for the management of adult patients with supraventricular tachycardia: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on clinical practice guidelines and the Heart Rhythm Society [^113jMJp3]. Heart Rhythm (2016). Medium credibility.

Atrial flutter — acute treatment recommendations: COR I, LOE B-NR, acute antithrombotic therapy is recommended to align with antithrombotic therapy for atrial fibrillation (AF). COR IIa, LOE B-R, intravenous amiodarone can be useful for acute control of the ventricular rate in atrial flutter with systolic heart failure when beta blockers are contraindicated or ineffective and in the absence of pre-excitation; because of potential toxicity, amiodarone should not be used for long-term rate control in most patients, and potential risks and benefits should be considered for patients with atrial flutter lasting ≥ 48 hours who are not adequately anticoagulated.

### ACC / AHA 2005 guideline update for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association task force on practice guidelines (writing committee to update the 2001 guidelines for the evaluation and management of heart failure): developed in collaboration with the American College of Chest Physicians and the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation: endorsed by the Heart Rhythm Society [^116T4p63]. Circulation (2005). Medium credibility.

Primary prevention and antiarrhythmic drug therapy in low ejection fraction (EF) heart failure — risk, drug effects, and amiodarone use — are summarized as follows: Patients with low EF without prior history of cardiac arrest, spontaneous VT, or inducible VT have a risk of sudden death that remains significant, and approximately 50% to 70% of patients with low EF and symptomatic HF have episodes of nonsustained VT on routine ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring. Antiarrhythmic drugs to suppress premature ventricular depolarizations and nonsustained ventricular arrhythmias have not improved survival, and most antiarrhythmic drugs have negative inotropic effects and can increase the risk of serious arrhythmia, particularly in patients with low EF. This risk is especially high with the use of Class IA agents (quinidine and procainamide), Class IC agents (flecainide and encainide), and some Class III agents (D-sotalol), which have increased mortality in post-MI trials. Amiodarone has been associated with overall neutral effects on survival in patients with low EF and HF and has been shown in some trials to increase LVEF and decrease the incidence of worsening HF, but side effects include thyroid abnormalities, pulmonary toxicity, hepatotoxicity, neuropathy, insomnia, and numerous other reactions. Therefore, amiodarone should not be considered as part of the routine treatment of patients with HF, although it remains the agent most likely to be safe and effective when antiarrhythmic therapy is necessary to prevent recurrent atrial fibrillation or symptomatic ventricular arrhythmias. Other pharmacological antiarrhythmic therapies, apart from beta-blockers, are rarely indicated in HF but may occasionally be used to suppress recurrent ICD shocks when amiodarone has been ineffective or discontinued owing to toxicity.

### Amiodarone hydrochloride (Pacerone) [^1175svQX]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: PULMONARY, HEPATIC and CARDIAC TOXICITY

Pacerone is intended for use only in patients with the indicated life-threatening arrhythmias because its use is accompanied by substantial toxicity [see Indications and Usage (1)].

Pacerone can cause pulmonary toxicity (hypersensitivity pneumonitis or interstitial/alveolar pneumonitis) that has resulted in clinically manifest disease at rates as high as 17% in some series of patients. Pulmonary toxicity has been fatal about 10% of the time. Obtain a baseline chest X-ray and pulmonary-function tests, including diffusion capacity, when Pacerone therapy is initiated. Repeat history, physical exam, and chest X-ray every 3 to 6 months [see Warnings and Precautions 5.2)].

Pacerone can cause hepatoxicity, which can be fatal. Obtain baseline and periodic liver transaminases and discontinue or reduce dose if the increase exceeds three times normal, or doubles in a patient with an elevated baseline. Discontinue Pacerone if the patient experiences signs or symptoms of clinical liver injury [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

Pacerone can exacerbate arrhythmias. Initiate amiodarone hydrochloride in a clinical setting where continuous electrocardiograms and cardiac resuscitation are available [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

WARNING: PULMONARY, HEPATIC, and CARDIAC TOXICITY

See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning.

Reserve Pacerone for patients with the indicated life-threatening arrhythmias because its use is accompanied by substantial toxicity, some also life-threatening. Utilize alternative agents first. (1)
Pacerone' s life-threatening toxicities include pulmonary (5.2), hepatic (5.3), and proarrhythmic (5.4).
Initiate under hospital or specialist supervision. (5)

### Amiodarone hci [^1163bdjq]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

A careful assessment of the potential risks and benefits of administering amiodarone HCl injection must be made in patients with thyroid dysfunction due to the possibility of arrhythmia breakthrough or exacerbation of arrhythmia, which may result in death, in these patients.

Pulmonary Disorders

Early-onset Pulmonary Toxicity

There have been postmarketing reports of acute-onset (days to weeks) pulmonary injury in patients treated with intravenous amiodarone. Findings have included pulmonary infiltrates and/or mass on X-ray, bronchospasm, wheezing, fever, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, and hypoxia. Some cases have progressed to respiratory failure and/or death.

ARDS

Two percent (2%) of patients were reported to have adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) during clinical studies involving 48 hours of therapy. ARDS is a disorder characterized by bilateral, diffuse pulmonary infiltrates with pulmonary edema and varying degrees of respiratory insufficiency. The clinical and radiographic picture can arise after a variety of lung injuries, such as those resulting from trauma, shock, prolonged cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and aspiration pneumonia, conditions present in many of the patients enrolled in the clinical studies. There have been postmarketing reports of ARDS in intravenous amiodarone patients. Intravenous amiodarone may play a role in causing or exacerbating pulmonary disorders in those patients.

### Population-level incidence and risk factors for pulmonary toxicity associated with amiodarone [^115Lu7cT]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2011). Low credibility.

Estimates from clinical trials and small observational studies of the incidence of pulmonary toxicity (PT) associated with amiodarone range from 1% to 10%. We report a unique study of the population-based incidence and potential predictors of PT in a real-world atrial fibrillation (AF) population. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients ≥ 65 years old discharged with AF using linked administrative databases from Quebec, Canada from 1999 to 2007. "Users" and "nonusers" of amiodarone were identified by prescriptions dispensed within 7 days after hospital discharge. PT was defined through International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and Tenth Revision codes for pulmonary fibrosis, alveolar/interstitial lung disease, and adult respiratory distress syndrome. Potential risk factors for PT were identified using multivariable Cox regression. PT occurred in 250 of 6,460 amiodarone users (3.87%) and 676 of 50,993 nonusers (1.33%). Age-standardized PT incidences were 28.30 and 16.02 per 1,000 person-years in men and women users, respectively, and 14.05 and 8.82 per 1,000 person-years in nonusers, respectively. It was associated with amiodarone exposure at all doses (≤ 200 mg/day, hazard ratio 1.62, 1.35 to 1.96; > 200 mg/day, 1.46, 1.22 to 1.75). Other predictors of PT included increasing age (1.01 per year, 1.00 to 1.02), male gender (1.37, 1.19 to 1.57), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (2.53, 2.21 to 2.89), and renal disease (1.26, 1.06 to 1.50). In conclusion, the population-based incidence of amiodarone PT is in the lower range of what has been previously reported. However, patients with AF who use amiodarone have an approximately 50% higher risk of PT than nonusers. Clinicians may be able to use the present results to identify patients at higher risk for PT and implement strategies to increase monitoring or select alternative therapy.
