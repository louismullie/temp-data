## Question

What is the differential diagnosis for acute epigastric pain?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis for acute epigastric pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate life threats and initial triage. Then, I should verify gastrointestinal versus extra-abdominal etiologies and how symptoms can mislead. Next, I will check what labs and imaging are most appropriate, including any pitfalls. After that, I need to consider specific diagnoses such as pancreatitis, peptic ulcer disease and its complications, biliary disease, cardiac causes, vascular catastrophes, and functional dyspepsia. Finally, I will confirm management priorities, analgesia, red flags, special populations, and safe disposition with follow-up recommendations.

> Let me first confirm the initial triage priorities, because I need to ensure we do not miss time-sensitive conditions presenting with epigastric pain, including myocardial ischemia, aortic or visceral artery dissection/rupture, perforated peptic ulcer, severe pancreatitis, and biliary sepsis; this means checking airway, breathing, circulation, vital signs, focused exam, obtaining an ECG and troponin when indicated, and starting pregnancy testing in those who could be pregnant, before narrowing the differential [^112BidjC] [^115GAXoL].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "epigastric" meaning "stomach" problems only; cardiac ischemia commonly presents atypically with epigastric discomfort and must be excluded early with ECG and high-sensitivity troponin, while GERD and dyspepsia symptoms overlap and cannot reliably rule out cardiac disease, so I should double-check for exertional features, risk factors, and concerning associated symptoms while I obtain objective testing [^111jUMNZ] [^114oF87g] [^112BidjC].

> Next, I should review pancreatitis carefully, because acute epigastric pain radiating to the back, with nausea/vomiting, and elevated lipase three times the upper limit of normal fulfills revised Atlanta criteria; let me verify that we do not assume alcohol or gallstones only, as medications and substances like cannabis can be culprits in some patients, and severity stratification plus early fluid resuscitation and multidisciplinary care improve outcomes in moderate–severe disease [^111jUMNZ] [^114UNNab].

> I will now examine peptic ulcer disease and complications, since NSAID or aspirin exposure, H. pylori, and epigastric pain are classic but not universal, and I need to check for bleeding or perforation; wait, I should verify signs such as hematemesis, melena, syncope, or sudden severe pain with peritonitis suggesting perforation, where delayed source control increases mortality and immediate surgical consultation is indicated [^115GAXoL].

> Let me think about biliary disease next; although right upper quadrant pain is typical, patients may localize to the epigastrium, so I should confirm that bedside or formal right upper quadrant ultrasonography is the first-line imaging to assess cholelithiasis and cholecystitis, and I must remember rare mimics such as gallbladder torsion when clinical deterioration occurs despite conservative management, necessitating operative evaluation [^112BidjC] [^113NaDMm].

> But wait, what if the pain is vascular rather than luminal or parenchymal; isolated spontaneous dissection of celiac or SMA arteries can present with epigastric pain and is detected on contrast-enhanced CT with an intimal flap, so I should keep this in mind, especially in middle-aged or older patients with abrupt severe pain, even when initial labs are unremarkable [^112LqT1p].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought CT should be obtained first for everyone with epigastric pain, but I should double-check the evidence; a conditional strategy using ultrasonography first based on clinical suspicion and then CT for negative or inconclusive ultrasound yields the highest sensitivity for urgent conditions while minimizing radiation exposure, with CT providing the largest incremental diagnostic accuracy after clinical evaluation when appropriately targeted [^112EpQGz] [^115Nrka8] [^113NoZTN].

> I need to check which laboratory tests actually narrow the differential; a reasonable panel includes CBC, CRP when available, hepatic panel, bilirubin, electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, lipase, urinalysis, and pregnancy testing where applicable, while recognizing that labs alone can be insensitive or nonspecific, thereby reinforcing the need to integrate history, exam, and targeted imaging rather than over-relying on isolated abnormalities [^116BE929] [^112BidjC].

> Let me consider GERD and dyspepsia carefully; symptoms alone do a poor job distinguishing organic from functional disease, and I should confirm whether alarm features or age thresholds prompt endoscopy, whereas in the absence of red flags, test-and-treat for H. pylori and a time-limited trial of acid suppression are reasonable, acknowledging that many patients ultimately meet criteria for functional dyspepsia and may respond to PPI therapy albeit with modest effect sizes [^114UTqsE] [^113qea4V] [^1156gwuC].

> Hold on, I should verify functional dyspepsia subtypes; Rome IV separates epigastric pain syndrome from postprandial distress syndrome, and although EPS was historically considered meal-unrelated, emerging data suggest a relevant postprandial component in many patients, so I need to ensure I document the meal relationship and overlapping gastroesophageal symptoms that might influence management decisions and counseling [^114UTqsE] [^114WR3te] [^113LDsrW].

> I should confirm red flags and special populations; in pregnancy with hypertensive disorders, epigastric or right upper quadrant pain should prompt evaluation for HELLP syndrome because the pain may reflect hepatic capsular stretch and predicts higher risk, while in older adults, atypical presentations and higher prevalence of vascular and surgical emergencies mandate a lower threshold for imaging and admission [^1113HDPw] [^114wGRxk].

> Next, I should review analgesia and symptom control without obscuring diagnosis; evidence-based emergency care supports adequate analgesia and considers nonpharmacologic attention-control techniques alongside pharmacologic measures, so I should not undertreat pain while workup proceeds, and I can incorporate techniques like controlled breathing or distraction where appropriate [^115EKP4V].

> Hold on, I should verify disposition and safety-netting; if no definitive diagnosis is established, repeated reassessment of vitals, exam, and pain trajectory is essential, with clear return precautions and follow-up, and when the clinical picture remains concerning or equivocal despite evaluation, early surgical consultation and even diagnostic laparoscopy may be warranted to avoid missed time-sensitive pathology [^111FXtYL] [^116ni8gB].

Acute epigastric pain has a broad differential, but the most common causes are **peptic ulcer disease, gastritis, and pancreatitis**. Other important etiologies include GERD [^114oF87g], biliary colic, myocardial ischemia [^112BidjC], and functional dyspepsia [^113LDsrW]. Life-threatening causes such as perforated ulcer [^115GAXoL], aortic dissection [^114f5xH7], and mesenteric ischemia must be **excluded early** [^112EpQGz]. Initial evaluation should include a **focused history, physical exam, and targeted labs** (CBC, lipase, LFTs, ECG) [^111jUMNZ] [^116BE929]; imaging with ultrasound or CT is guided by clinical suspicion [^113NoZTN] [^115Nrka8]. Management is diagnosis-specific, with urgent intervention for unstable patients or those with peritonitis [^116ni8gB].

Clinical features include **severe epigastric pain radiating to the back**, nausea, vomiting, and elevated lipase/amylase [^1137px3N] [^111DvWc5]. Risk factors include **gallstones, alcohol**, hypertriglyceridemia, and medications (e.g. erythromycin, cannabis) [^1137px3N] [^115TvHUg] [^111DvWc5].

---

### Functional dyspepsia

Clinical features include **chronic epigastric pain** or discomfort without structural disease, often meal-related [^113LDsrW] [^114UTqsE]. Risk factors include anxiety, IBS, gastroparesis, and **H. pylori**.

---

## Hepatobiliary causes

### Biliary colic and cholecystitis

Clinical features include epigastric or RUQ pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and **Murphy's sign** [^112BidjC]. Risk factors include **gallstones**, obesity, rapid weight loss, and female sex.

---

Clinical features may include epigastric pain, nausea, diaphoresis, dyspnea, and **ECG changes** [^111jUMNZ]. Risk factors include **hypertension**, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, smoking, and family history.

---

### Aortic dissection

Clinical features include **sudden severe epigastric or chest pain**, pulse deficits, and hypotension. Risk factors include hypertension, **connective tissue disorders**, and vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors [^114f5xH7].

---

## Rare and unusual causes

- **Perigastric appendagitis**: Rare cause of severe epigastric pain, diagnosed by CT [^1172mdQ4].
- **Epiploic appendagitis**: Typically lower abdominal pain, but can present atypically [^112aQ7Zc].
- **Gastric trichobezoar**: Rare cause of obstruction and epigastric pain, especially in children [^1145jtVn].

---

## Diagnostic approach

A systematic approach is **essential** [^1114fmQt]:

- **History and physical examination**: Characterize pain, associated symptoms, risk factors, and comorbidities [^111jUMNZ] [^112MiJLT].
- **Laboratory tests**: CBC, lipase, LFTs, ECG, and others as indicated [^111jUMNZ] [^116BE929].
- **Imaging**: Ultrasound or CT based on clinical suspicion and patient factors [^113NoZTN] [^115Nrka8].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Supportive care**: Analgesia, antiemetics, IV fluids, PPIs as indicated.
- **Definitive treatment**: Antibiotics, surgery, or endoscopic intervention for specific diagnoses [^112BidjC].
- **Urgent intervention**: Immediate surgery or intervention for unstable patients or those with peritonitis [^115GAXoL].

---

Acute epigastric pain has a broad differential, including gastrointestinal, hepatobiliary, cardiovascular, and rare causes. A systematic approach with focused history, examination, and targeted investigations is **essential** for accurate diagnosis and management [^112BidjC].

A 59-year-old Chinese male presented to the emergency department with acute onset epigastric pain. He had no cardiovascular risk factors and was only on targeted therapy, pazopanib, for newly diagnosed metastatic renal clear cell carcinoma. He was found to have a Stanford type B acute aortic dissection with moderately elevated systolic blood pressure of 150 mm Hg. Although not a listed side effect, various case reports have shown a potential association between the use of vascular endothelial growth factor tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeted therapy and an acute aortic dissection. It would be prudent to consider the possibility of an aortic dissection in patients on such drugs with suspicious clinical presentation, even in the absence of other risk factors.

The patient presented with two of the three criteria from the revised Atlanta classification, including acute onset epigastric pain and elevated lipase, which led to a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (AP) without a clear etiology. Given that the patient was previously well, the negative workup for common causes of AP, and the progressive history of cannabis use coinciding with the onset of symptoms, the likely cause for the patient's symptoms was ingestion of cannabis. He was diagnosed with cannabis-induced acute pancreatitis (CIAP) with secondary upper gastrointestinal bleeding resulting from a Mallory-Weiss tear.

### Perforated peptic ulcer [^115GAXoL]. Lancet (2015). Low credibility.

Patients with perforated peptic ulcer (PPU) may present with severe, sudden-onset epigastric pain, which can become generalized. The peritonitis resulting from acid exposure may present as abdominal 'board-like rigidity'. The clinical picture may be less clear in the obese, the immunocompromised, patients on steroids, those with a reduced level of consciousness, the elderly, and children. In these situations, the clinical history and examination may be non-specific, prompting additional imaging and laboratory studies to rule out differential diagnoses. Only two-thirds of patients present with frank peritonitis, which may in part explain the diagnostic delay in some patients.

During clinical evaluation, a number of differential diagnoses must be considered. It is particularly important to exclude a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm or acute pancreatitis. The former is critical due to its high mortality if unrecognized and treatment is delayed, while the latter requires primarily non-operative management.

Diagnostic imaging may have to be delayed pending resuscitation in critically ill patients. Those presenting with generalized peritonitis, with or without signs of sepsis, will usually be directed straight to the operating room. Notably, mortality increases with every hour surgery is delayed.

### Current trends in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^114oF87g]. Gut and Liver (2018). High credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease is associated with a variety of symptoms and risk factors, including:

- **Difficulty sleeping**: This condition often disrupts a good night's rest.
- **Epigastric abdominal pain**: Patients frequently experience discomfort in the upper abdominal region.
- **Laryngitis and hiatal hernia**: These conditions are commonly linked with reflux.
- **Burning sensation and obesity**: Both are frequently noted in affected individuals.
- **Cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption**: These lifestyle factors contribute to the disease's progression.
- **Dietary influences**: Eating large meals, eating late at night, and consuming coffee, fatty, or fried foods exacerbate symptoms.
- **Chest pain**: Often confused with cardiac chest pain but related to GERD.
- **Pregnancy**: This condition can increase susceptibility to reflux.
- **Other symptoms and conditions**: Include dysphagia, food regurgitation, food impaction, asthma, scleroderma, chronic cough, and connective tissue diseases.

It is crucial for patients to identify and manage these contributing factors to effectively control symptoms.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: Diagnostic accuracy study [^113NoZTN]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain accounts for 5–10% of visits to the emergency department. Rapid and accurate detection of urgent conditions is vital for managing patients and ensuring efficient throughput. Decision-making based solely on clinical and laboratory evaluation in patients with abdominal pain can lead to unnecessary interventions or delayed treatment of urgent conditions. Several forms of imaging, particularly ultrasonography and computed tomography (CT), can assist in clinical decision-making. Imaging has been shown to have a positive effect on the accuracy of clinical diagnosis, to lead to changes in management decisions, and to increase the level of diagnostic certainty in patients with acute abdominal pain. The use of early CT in these patients has been shown to reduce the number of serious diagnoses missed.

Over the years, diagnostic imaging in the emergency department has contributed to increased hospital costs, with CT being a significant source of radiation exposure for adult patients. This emphasizes the need for a rational, evidence-based approach to imaging in patients with abdominal pain. The American College of Radiology has provided guidelines for imaging based on the specific locations of abdominal tenderness. However, this differentiation of imaging use with patient-tailored guidelines may not cover the wide spectrum of clinical presentations of abdominal pain.

An optimal imaging strategy for patients with abdominal pain would lead to timely identification.

### Functional dyspepsia [^111FjQA4]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Structural causes are absent in more than 50% of patients with symptoms referred to the gastroduodenal region when routine diagnostic tests are applied. New knowledge holds the prospect that targeted therapy may more optimally manage subsets of these patients with functional dyspepsia.

- **Recent findings**: An understanding of gut-to-brain and brain-to-gut pathways in functional dyspepsia is expanding. Minimal mucosal inflammation with eosinophils, and in some cases mast cells, characterized by ultrastructural changes in the duodenum, appears to be present in a substantial subgroup of functional dyspepsia patients identified globally by investigators. Although antibiotic therapy targeting Helicobacter pylori appears effective in a small proportion of functional dyspepsia patients, eradication therapy may be more effective in those with microscopic duodenal inflammation, a potentially important finding needing confirmation. This may suggest that the effects of antibiotics for functional dyspepsia are not simply mediated by the eradication of gastric H. pylori but may have other antibacterial effects, such as on the duodenal microbiome. Abnormal visceral sensory function plays a key role not only in the manifestations of functional dyspepsia but also in peptic ulcer disease.

- **Summary**: The pathophysiologic concepts underlying functional dyspepsia and related treatment approaches are shifting from a focus on H. pylori, acid suppression, or modulation of motility toward new models. New evidence suggests that minimal duodenal inflammation may contribute substantially to the pathogenesis of functional dyspepsia.

### Evaluation of acute abdominal pain in adults [^111kDKdj]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain can represent a spectrum of conditions ranging from benign and self-limited diseases to surgical emergencies. Evaluating abdominal pain requires an approach that relies on the likelihood of disease, patient history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The location of pain is a useful starting point and will guide further evaluation. For example, right lower quadrant pain strongly suggests appendicitis.

Certain elements of the history and physical examination are particularly helpful; for instance, constipation and abdominal distension strongly suggest bowel obstruction. In contrast, others, such as anorexia, offer little predictive value for appendicitis.

The American College of Radiology has recommended different imaging studies for assessing abdominal pain based on pain location. Ultrasonography is recommended to assess right upper quadrant pain, whereas computed tomography is recommended for right and left lower quadrant pain. It is also important to consider special populations such as women, who are at risk of genitourinary diseases that may cause abdominal pain, and the elderly, who may present with atypical symptoms of a disease.

### Insights into the evaluation and management of dyspepsia: Recent developments and new guidelines [^113qea4V]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

If symptoms were a good discriminator for the likelihood of a patient with dyspepsia having an underlying organic pathology, this would greatly aid the physician in their clinical assessment; however, unfortunately, this is not the case. A previous systematic review of diagnostic test studies demonstrated convincingly that a physician's opinion, based on symptoms reported by the patient, had limited diagnostic ability to discriminate between organic causes of dyspepsia and functional dyspepsia (FD).

Historically, FD was referred to as nonulcer dyspepsia, which created the impression that the diagnosis was based on the absence of specific underlying organic pathology, thereby encouraging the use of investigations in all patients. Although more recently the terminology has changed, FD still remains a diagnosis of exclusion. The Rome Foundation, the expert group responsible for the classification of all functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, defines FD using the Rome IV criteria as bothersome postprandial fullness, early satiety, epigastric pain, or epigastric burning in the absence of structural disease, including at upper GI endoscopy, which would explain the symptoms. According to these criteria, the condition is subgrouped into two separate syndromes: the epigastric pain syndrome (EPS) and the postprandial distress syndrome (PDS).

- **Epigastric pain syndrome (EPS)**: Consists of intermittent pain or burning in the epigastrium, occurring at least once per week. The pain may be either induced or relieved by eating but may also occur while fasting. However, it should not fulfill biliary pain criteria.

### Navigating the maze of functional dyspepsia: Emergence of a new entity, postprandial epigastric pain syndrome [^114WR3te]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

The Rome IV criteria subdivide functional dyspepsia (FD) into postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) with meal-related symptoms — early satiation and/or postprandial fullness — and epigastric pain syndrome (EPS) with meal-unrelated symptoms — epigastric pain and/or burning. We aimed to systematically assess the relationship of epigastric pain to meal ingestion in four independent FD databases.

- **Methods**: In total, 1,337 FD patients were included. Three cohorts (local, national, and international, total n = 971) completed a Rome IV symptom questionnaire, with additional questions on meal relationship. In 498 patients undergoing a standard gastric emptying breath test, we analyzed the evolution of symptoms during a 4-hour window. Patients were categorized as postprandial epigastric pain (pEPS), meal-unrelated epigastric pain (murEPS), and PDS symptoms with/without postprandial epigastric pain. Symptom profiles and demographics were compared between these categories.

- **Results**: Distribution for Rome IV PDS/EPS/overlap was 896/252/186. Postprandial epigastric pain without PDS symptoms, i.e. pEPS, was present in approximately 40% of EPS patients, while 60% had murEPS. Fifty percent of PDS patients reported postprandial epigastric pain. Patient demographics were similar across categories. Overall, PDS patients with postprandial epigastric pain had the most associated gastrointestinal symptoms compared to pEPS, murEPS, or PDS without postprandial epigastric pain.

- **Conclusion**: In contrast to earlier characterization of EPS symptoms as purely meal-unrelated, we identified a relevant postprandial component.

### Acute abdominal pain in adults: Evaluation and diagnosis [^112BidjC]. American Family Physician (2023). Low credibility.

Acute abdominal pain, defined as nontraumatic abdominal pain lasting fewer than seven days, is a common presenting concern with a broad differential diagnosis. The most common causes are gastroenteritis and nonspecific abdominal pain, followed by cholelithiasis, urolithiasis, diverticulitis, and appendicitis. Extra-abdominal causes such as respiratory infections and abdominal wall pain should be considered. Pain location, history, and examination findings help guide the workup after ensuring hemodynamic stability.

Recommended tests may include a complete blood count, C-reactive protein, hepatobiliary markers, electrolytes, creatinine, glucose, urinalysis, lipase, and pregnancy testing. Several diagnoses, such as cholecystitis, appendicitis, and mesenteric ischemia, cannot be confirmed clinically and typically require imaging. Conditions such as urolithiasis and diverticulitis may be diagnosed clinically in certain cases. Imaging studies are chosen based on the location of pain and index of suspicion for specific etiologies.

Computed tomography with intravenous contrast media is often chosen for generalized abdominal pain, left upper quadrant pain, and lower abdominal pain. Ultrasonography is the study of choice for right upper quadrant pain. Point-of-care ultrasonography can aid in the prompt diagnosis of several etiologies of acute abdominal pain, including cholelithiasis, urolithiasis, and appendicitis. In patients who have female reproductive organs, diagnoses such as ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, and adnexal torsion should be considered.

### Postprandial symptoms originating from the stomach in functional dyspepsia [^116hSMFd]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2013). Low credibility.

Functional dyspepsia (FD) is characterized by chronic epigastric symptoms. The stomach has been held responsible for the generation of symptoms, but the latest reports have pointed out that the duodenum can also be implicated in the pathophysiology. The aim of this study was to elucidate which dyspeptic symptoms originate from the stomach and/or from the small intestine following a meal.

- **Methods**: Two hundred eighty-four FD patients underwent a gastric emptying breath test. Breath samples were taken, and the intensity of six dyspeptic symptoms (fullness, bloating, belching, nausea, epigastric burning, and epigastric pain) was scored before a meal and at 15-minute intervals for a period of 240 minutes postprandially. Time curves of each symptom were analyzed, and severity scores during the gastric and the intestinal phase were compared.

- **Key results**: Time curves of fullness, bloating, belching, and nausea displayed a significant negative slope, while symptom severity of epigastric burning and epigastric pain did not decrease over time. Numerical analysis revealed that scores for fullness, bloating, and belching were higher during the gastric phase compared with the intestinal phase. On the other hand, intensities of nausea, epigastric burning, and epigastric pain were similar during both phases.

- **Conclusions & inferences**: Intensities of fullness, bloating, and belching decrease with food moving from the stomach to the small intestine, indicating that the stomach plays a crucial role in the generation of these symptoms. In contrast, the symptom severity of epigastric burning and…

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for acute pain, more specifically with respect to attentional control, the EUSEM 2020 guidelines recommend advising attention control methods. These include distraction techniques, concentration and focus on external stimuli using music, imagery, controlled breathing, breastfeeding for infants, and play for adult and pediatric patients. Recognize that virtual reality is emerging as a potential technique to engage patients.

### Dyspepsia [^11215UFb]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Dyspepsia affects up to 40% of the general population and significantly reduces quality of life. A small proportion of patients have peptic ulcer disease as a cause, which can be treated empirically with Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy in those that are infected. Approximately 20% have gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and this can be effectively treated with proton pump inhibitor therapy. Patients who remain symptomatic may warrant an endoscopy, but most will have functional dyspepsia. Treatment of functional dyspepsia remains a challenge.

Recent large randomized trials suggest that tricyclic antidepressant therapy may be effective in functional dyspepsia. A phase III randomized controlled trial reports that a new prokinetic, acotiamide, reduces dyspepsia symptoms in functional dyspepsia patients. There are also preliminary data suggesting that buspirone, a drug that promotes gastric accommodation, is effective in functional dyspepsia. Additionally, there are data indicating that functional dyspepsia is caused by subtle manifestations of inflammation in the upper gastrointestinal tract, possibly due to food sensitivity or changes in gut flora.

The initial management of dyspepsia is well established, but managing those with continued symptoms is a challenge. Antidepressants and newer gastric motility agents show promise. Targeting the diet and gut microbiome is another area for future research in functional dyspepsia.

### Trends in visits, imaging, and diagnosis for emergency department abdominal pain presentations in the United States, 2007–2019 [^114X4gDa]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

EGS conditions are a useful measure of test positivity because they are captured in administrative data sets, are concrete diagnoses with clinical significance, typically require intervention, and frequently lead to morbidity or mortality. As new medical and procedural options have evolved, EGS diagnoses no longer exclusively lead to surgery. EGS conditions typically require operative or nonoperative management, which can include antibiotics, analgesia, inpatient medical or surgical management, interventional procedures, and/or surgery. Although we interpreted our test positivity as a CT scan leading to a diagnosis, NHAMCS does not observe the timing at which the diagnosis is made.

There are three potential cases for timing. Given the sensitivity and specificity of CT scans for common EGS diagnoses, diagnosis decision-making based on CT scans is likely the most common scenario. In some cases, the diagnosis may be strongly suspected based on clinical signs and symptoms, and CT merely confirms a diagnosis. In others, CT could be obtained, anticipating negative imaging to rule out a high-risk diagnosis. This latter use case is unlikely to vary over time, however.

There appeared to be a visual increase in EGS diagnoses in the later period. While increased CT and ultrasound utilization seems to account for a substantial portion of this rise, as shown by the individual imaging time trends, an additional potential explanation includes imaging being conducted on those with a higher probability of disease. This could come about due to improved clinical targeting of patients at risk.

### Functional abdominal cramping pain: Expert practical guidance [^116qok39]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2022). Low credibility.

- **Algorithms to aid the recognition and management of FACP**: A proposed algorithm for the optimal diagnosis and management of FACP by physicians, considered by the expert panel to be appropriate for use in primary care, is presented in Figure 2. This algorithm is based on the definition of FACP and the management considerations outlined in the preceding sections. The starting point for the diagnosis is the core symptomatic manifestation of FACP: pain with cramping characteristics, generally considered to arise from primary gastrointestinal dysfunction.

	- To establish the diagnosis of FACP, the critical first step is the exclusion of a structural organic cause. This can be achieved through the recognition of alarm signals ("red flags") related to other symptoms experienced and/or the patient's family history of disease, and by considering the results of appropriate investigations conducted as indicated by such signals. The algorithm considers the likelihood of an IBS diagnosis in cases where FACP symptoms are associated with bowel habit alterations, thus emphasizing the distinction between IBS (as defined by the Rome IV criteria) and the definition of FACP proposed here.

	- Additionally, the algorithm seeks to rule out abdominal pain of gynecologic or cardiac origin. For first-line treatment, antispasmodics are recommended for patients whose symptoms fulfill the consensus definition of FACP and who lack signals of a potential differential diagnosis or other avoidable explanatory factors. Additional treatment options are suggested for patients who fail to achieve satisfactory symptom alleviation.

### Evaluation and management of dyspepsia [^117Aq3oo]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

Dyspepsia is a common clinical problem encountered by both primary care physicians and gastroenterologists. The initial evaluation should focus on identifying and treating potential causes of symptoms, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), peptic ulcer disease, and medication side effects, while also recognizing those at risk for more serious conditions like gastric cancer. This manuscript discusses the evaluation and management of dyspepsia, including the role of proton-pump inhibitors, treatment of Helicobacter pylori, and endoscopy. Finally, the treatment of refractory functional dyspepsia is addressed.

### Trends in visits, imaging, and diagnosis for emergency department abdominal pain presentations in the United States, 2007–2019 [^113voqZd]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

A potential explanation for the observed increase in imaging is that ED clinicians utilize their expertise to sort patients into a continuum of risk for clinically significant, intervenable intra-abdominal diagnoses. They respond to the increasing availability of CT over this period by lowering the testing threshold to include patients at a lower but still clinically meaningful risk of making such a diagnosis on CT.

For example, in the case of renal colic, consensus recommendations from multiple specialty experts favor imaging as presentations become higher risk, and as symptoms become less typical and the risk of diagnoses other than kidney stones becomes more likely. If this were the case for other high-risk conditions, we would anticipate that the proportion of patients diagnosed with an EGS condition at the end of an ED visit during which a CT was performed (test positivity) would decline as the rate of imaging increased.

Instead, we found that increases in test positivity occurred for every age group, suggesting increased EGS diagnoses in the population, or improved funneling of patients experiencing symptoms of EGS to the ED. This increased test positivity with CT scans also provides a partial explanation for the increasing proportion of abdominal pain ED visits diagnosed with EGS conditions overall: greater CT utilization means more EGS conditions are being found, resulting in fewer missed diagnoses. This may be particularly important for older adults, who are at greater risk of morbidity and mortality for a given diagnosis. Especially in younger ages, however, the importance…

Presentation and investigation in secondary care

Presentation of dyspepsia to secondary care is common, with symptoms accounting for around 10% of all patient referrals to gastroenterology clinics ultimately being diagnosed with functional dyspepsia (FD). Due to unfamiliarity with diagnostic criteria, most patients are referred without a specific working diagnosis of FD, even though many necessary investigations have often been performed in primary care. Patients are referred for endoscopy consideration when their general practitioner cannot directly access this investigation. Further investigations may be requested if there is diagnostic doubt or non-response to treatment. When necessary investigations have been completed, a careful clinical history is usually sufficient to confirm the diagnosis, reassure the patient, demonstrate the clinician's commitment to help, and offer appropriate treatment.

### Proton pump inhibitors for functional dyspepsia [^1165fiN9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Functional dyspepsia (FD or non-ulcer dyspepsia) is defined as continuous or frequently recurring epigastric pain or discomfort for which no organic cause can be found. Acid suppressive therapy, including proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), has been proposed as a therapeutic option in FD, but its efficacy remains controversial. While PPIs are generally considered safe and well-tolerated, they have been associated with adverse events, especially in the long term. For this reason, decisions on whether to initiate or continue PPI therapy should be made based on an appropriate clinical indication. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review to evaluate whether PPI therapy provides symptomatic relief in FD.

- **Objectives**: To determine the efficacy of proton pump inhibitors in the improvement of global symptoms of dyspepsia and quality of life compared to placebo, H2 receptor antagonists, or prokinetics in people with functional dyspepsia.

- **Search methods**: We searched the following electronic databases: the Cochrane Library (to January 2016), MEDLINE (OvidSP; to February 2016), Embase (OvidSP; to February 2016), SIGLE grey literature (up to February 2016), and clinical trial registries. We handsearched abstracts from conferences up to February 2016 and screened non-systematic reviews, systematic reviews, and guidelines to identify any additional trials. We contacted trialists to obtain missing information.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing any PPI with placebo, H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs), or prokinetics for the treatment of FD.

A patient in her late 20s presented with severe epigastric pain. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was performed to exclude an upper gastrointestinal perforation, which revealed findings of perigastric appendagitis. This is a rare cause of severe upper abdominal pain. The patient was treated with oral and intravenous analgesia medication and was discharged the next day. No surgical intervention was required.

### Pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia [^117Uyhzs]. Gut (2002). Low credibility.

Functional dyspepsia is a symptom complex characterized by postprandial upper abdominal discomfort or pain, early satiety, nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, bloating, and anorexia in the absence of organic disease. Gastrointestinal motor abnormalities, altered visceral sensation, and psychosocial factors have all been identified as major pathophysiological mechanisms. This perspective has now replaced the earlier view that the condition was the result of a sole motor or sensory disorder of the stomach. Future therapeutic strategies should be aimed at reducing nociception as well as enhancing the accommodation response.

### Insights into the evaluation and management of dyspepsia: Recent developments and new guidelines [^113LA7E4]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

In the case of both EPS and PDS, although heartburn is not a dyspeptic symptom, it may often coexist. However, symptoms that are relieved by the passage of gas or feces should generally not be considered part of dyspepsia. Persistent vomiting should prompt the consideration of an alternative diagnosis. Patients may have both EPS and PDS, and studies in secondary care have demonstrated overlap between the two disorders in up to one-third of patients with FD.

Patients may struggle to interpret what is meant by verbal descriptions of dyspepsia symptoms. There is some evidence that representing symptoms using pictograms can improve the concordance of symptom evaluation between patients and physicians and may therefore be a useful tool in the assessment of the dyspeptic patient.

- **Figure 2**: Pictograms showing the cardinal symptoms of functional dyspepsia (adapted from Tack and colleagues).

In a large validation study of the previous iteration, the Rome III criteria, in secondary care, 1452 consecutive adult patients with undifferentiated GI symptoms underwent a complete upper GI endoscopy. The reference standard used to define the presence of true FD was epigastric pain, early satiety, or postprandial fullness, and no organic disease at endoscopy. Overall, 50% of patients met the Rome III criteria for FD, of whom 24% were found to have organic pathology detected at endoscopy. The Rome criteria therefore demonstrated a disappointing performance in their ability to identify patients with FD prior to performing an upper GI endoscopy and, therefore, avoid unnecessary investigation.

### Torsion of the gallbladder: A rare but important differential to consider when treating acute cholecystitis non-operatively [^113NaDMm]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 79-year-old woman presented with postprandial epigastric pain. She had normal vital signs, inflammatory markers, and liver function tests. Ultrasound and CT of the abdomen demonstrated features consistent with acute cholecystitis. Her medical comorbidities and extensive abdominal surgical history prompted the decision to treat non-operatively. Despite optimal medical management, worsening abdominal pain and uptrending inflammatory markers developed. She underwent an emergency laparoscopy, which revealed a necrotic gallbladder secondary to an anticlockwise complete gallbladder torsion — a rare condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality if managed non-operatively. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was achieved without complication, and the patient had an uneventful recovery.

Preoperative diagnosis of torsion of the gallbladder is difficult. However, there are certain patient demographics and imaging characteristics that can help surgeons differentiate it from acute cholecystitis, a condition which can be safely managed non-operatively in selected patients. The differentiating features are elaborated on in this case report.

### Editorial: Reflux, dyspepsia, and Rome III (or Rome IV?) [^113wPzeE]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2010). Low credibility.

The paper by Xiao et al. in this issue of the American Journal of Gastroenterology reports that patients with functional dyspepsia (FD) complaining of epigastric burning have a higher probability of presenting abnormal gastroesophageal acid reflux, as well as responding to proton pump inhibitor therapy than those complaining of epigastric pain, bothersome postprandial fullness, or early satiety. No differences in the above parameters were detected when comparing patients with epigastric pain syndrome and postprandial distress syndrome, as proposed by the Rome III classification of FD. If confirmed, these results contribute to clarifying the relationship between FD and gastroesophageal reflux disease and, at the same time, highlight the importance of analyzing individual symptoms rather than clusters of symptoms when managing patients complaining of upper gastrointestinal symptoms.

### Update on the evaluation and management of functional dyspepsia [^115GhGa4]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Dyspepsia affects up to 40 percent of adults each year and is often diagnosed as functional (nonulcer) dyspepsia. The defining symptoms are postprandial fullness, early satiation, or epigastric pain or burning in the absence of causative structural disease. These symptoms may coexist with symptoms of functional gastrointestinal disorders, such as gastroesophageal reflux and irritable bowel syndrome, as well as anxiety and depression.

The history and physical examination can help identify other possible causes of the symptoms. Warning signs of serious disease, such as cancer, include unintended weight loss, progressive dysphagia, persistent vomiting, evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding, and a family history of cancer. In these cases, more extensive laboratory investigation, imaging, and endoscopy should be considered as clinically indicated.

During the initial evaluation, a test-and-treat strategy to identify and eradicate Helicobacter pylori infection is more effective than empiric treatment and more cost-effective than initial endoscopy. Eradication of H. pylori helps one out of 15 patients with functional dyspepsia diagnosed by endoscopy but may not be cost-effective.

Treatment options that may be beneficial for functional dyspepsia include histamine H2 blockers, proton pump inhibitors, and prokinetic agents. Although psychotropic medications and psychological interventions have no proven benefit in patients with functional dyspepsia, they are appropriate for treating common psychiatric comorbidities.

### Hellp syndrome and associated factors among pregnant women with preeclampsia/eclampsia at a referral hospital in southwestern Uganda: A cross-sectional study [^1113HDPw]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Low credibility.

Women with preeclampsia or eclampsia and epigastric pain were five times more likely to have HELLP syndrome than were those without epigastric pain. Similar findings have been reported by other studies. In HELLP syndrome, fibrin and fatty acids are deposited in the intrahepatic sinusoids, causing hepatic sinusoidal blockage and hepatic congestion and necrosis with intraparenchymal and subscapular hemorrhages. Epigastric pain follows the resultant stretching of the liver capsule and manifests as somatic pain at the epigastrium/right upper quadrant because visceral pain from afferent parasympathetic fibers from the liver is referred to dermatomes at the epigastrium. The implication of this finding is that, in settings where laboratory services are limited, the presence of epigastric pain in women with preeclampsia or eclampsia may serve as a crucial clinical indicator of HELLP syndrome. Identifying and recognizing epigastric pain in conjunction with hypertensive disorders during pregnancy could guide clinical decision-making in resource-constrained environments, facilitating prompt interventions and appropriate management to mitigate the risks associated with HELLP syndrome.

The strength of our study lies in the comprehensive and objective diagnosis of HELLP syndrome using the three laboratory criteria. This study, however, has several limitations that should be taken into consideration when interpreting the study findings. First, as a single-center study that was conducted at a regional referral hospital in a low-resource setting in southwestern Uganda, the generalizability…

### Studies of the symptom abdominal pain — a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112MiJLT]. Family Practice (2014). Low credibility.

Diagnostic reasoning in primary care patients with abdominal pain is a complex challenge for GPs. To ensure evidence-based decision-making for this symptom, GPs need setting-specific knowledge about the prevalence, potential risks for diseases, and the chance of recovery or risk of undesirable courses of disease.

- **Aim**: We conducted a systematic review of symptom-evaluating studies on the prevalence, aetiology, or prognosis of abdominal pain.

- **Methods**: We included all studies evaluating the symptom 'abdominal pain' as a reason for consultation in primary care. All types of study designs were included except for qualitative studies. Studies focused solely on children or settings other than primary care were also excluded.

- **Results**: We identified 14 studies. The mean consultation prevalence is 2.8% for abdominal pain. In about one-third of patients, the underlying cause of abdominal pain cannot be specified. The most common aetiologies are gastroenteritis (7.2–18.7%), irritable bowel disease (2.6–13.2%), urological cause (5.3%), and gastritis (5.2%). About 1 in 10 abdominal pain patients suffers from an acute disease like appendicitis (1.9%), diverticulitis (3.0%), biliary/pancreatic (4.0%), or neoplastic (1.0%) diseases needing immediate therapy.

- **Conclusion**: There is a high prevalence of patients consulting GPs for abdominal pain. The review identified a comparably high rate of acute underlying diseases in need of further investigation or therapy. At the same time, the underlying cause of the complaints often remains unexplained. Further symptom-evaluating studies are necessary.

### Gastroparesis and functional dyspepsia: Different diseases or different ends of the spectrum [^115uDTjm]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2020). Low credibility.

This review assesses the relationship between gastroparesis and functional dyspepsia in light of recent research assessing cause, pathophysiology, and treatment.

- **Recent findings**: The Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI) lacks the ability to readily distinguish functional dyspepsia from gastroparesis based on symptoms. Although prior studies found that the extent of delay in gastric emptying did not accurately predict the severity of symptoms, when optimally measured, delayed gastric emptying may, in fact, correlate with gastroparesis symptoms. Enteric dysmotility may be an important risk factor for gastroparesis. Altered central processing may play a role in symptom generation for both gastroparesis and functional dyspepsia based on functional brain MRI. Treatment directed towards reducing low-grade inflammation and improving mucosal barrier function in the duodenum may represent a novel therapeutic target for functional dyspepsia, whereas gastric peroral endoscopy myotomy (G-POEM) remains a promising intervention for refractory gastroparesis.

- **Summary**: Abnormalities on functional MRI of the brain have been identified in patients with functional dyspepsia and gastroparesis. Small bowel dysmotility and duodenal barrier dysfunction have been implicated in the pathophysiology of gastroparesis and functional dyspepsia, respectively. New treatments for functional dyspepsia may target low-grade duodenal inflammation and barrier dysfunction. The pylorus remains a target in gastroparesis.

### Trends in visits, imaging, and diagnosis for emergency department abdominal pain presentations in the United States, 2007–2019 [^111svvmD]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Unlike CT, hepatobiliary ultrasound does not use ionizing radiation. It represents a potentially effective diagnostic modality for upper abdominal pain or other symptoms suggesting a hepatobiliary origin. In contrast to either modality, abdominal X-rays are poorly sensitive and poorly specific for clinically significant disease and are potentially misleading.

Prior literature has demonstrated that utilization of imaging modalities increased as they have become more available. The rate of abdominal CT scans for all indications increased 17.5-fold from 1990 to 2009. Additionally, abdominal pain grew to become the leading chief complaint among those who underwent a CT scan in United States EDs from 1995 to 2007. The probability of obtaining a specific diagnosis via CT scan increases with age, yet for older adults with abdominal pain, nearly one in six ED visits has been shown to receive an X-ray without ultrasound or CT, a potentially ineffective test in older adults, and this occurs more often for older women. Little evidence is available from the past decade to understand whether the rapid initial growth of these modalities used to assess abdominal pain has continued, whether changes in utilization are differential across age groups, and whether increased imaging rates have resulted in greater rates of clinically significant diagnoses.

We hypothesized at the time of writing that a continuous increase in CT and ultrasound imaging modalities and a decrease in X-ray use occurred from 2007 to 2019. To test these hypotheses, we used nationally representative ED data to describe trends.

### Abdominal pain in the geriatric patient [^114PnMmF]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain in the elderly is a challenging condition to diagnose and treat. The geriatric population often has significant comorbidities and is on polypharmacy, which can mask symptoms. The presentation of common conditions may differ from that in younger patients, often lacking traditional indicators of disease. Thus, it is pivotal for clinicians to consider a wide differential during their workup. Additionally, extra-abdominal abnormalities that manifest as abdominal pain should also be considered.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: Diagnostic accuracy study [^1168bZoS]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

Eligible patients gave written informed consent before inclusion. Included patients had a medical history, physical examination, and initial laboratory investigations. A diagnosis based on clinical evaluation and laboratory investigation was recorded. Thereafter, patients were investigated with a full structured imaging protocol, including upright chest and supine abdominal plain radiography, abdominal ultrasonography, and CT. Once the physician in the emergency department had assessed the plain radiographs, a new diagnosis was recorded. Ultrasonography and CT were each read without disclosure of any results of the other investigation, but clinical information was available to the readers of ultrasonography and CT. The reader recorded the radiological diagnosis from the same list of diagnoses that was used by the physicians in the emergency department.

A general survey of the abdomen was done with ultrasonography, using the graded compression technique. CT images were obtained from the diaphragm to the groins, based on a specific protocol: effective mAs level of 165, 120 kV, maximum 2.5 mm collimation, maximum 3 mm slice width, and 0.5 s rotation time, with injection of 125 mL intravenous contrast following a 60-second delay at 3 ml/s. No oral or rectal contrast agents were used. CT done after office hours was re-evaluated blind the next day by a radiologist.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: Diagnostic accuracy study [^112EpQGz]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

- **Discussion**: In this study, relying solely on the clinical diagnosis would have led to a high number of false-positive urgent diagnoses. The use of ultrasonography as the only imaging investigation would have resulted in an unacceptably high number of missed urgent conditions. In comparison, computed tomography (CT) following clinical evaluation had better accuracy. The use of CT, conditional on a negative or inconclusive ultrasonography result, had the highest sensitivity for urgent conditions and would result in the lowest overall exposure to radiation. Imaging strategies driven by patients' characteristics or location of pain would have led to a loss in accuracy compared to the conditional CT strategy.

- **Potential limitations**: We acknowledge several potential limitations of this analysis. The study design, which included a full diagnostic investigation in all enrolled patients and carefully collected data, assigned a diagnosis after each step. This approach allowed us to make the comparisons presented here without conducting a randomized clinical trial with 11 groups. Although our approach allowed for comparing imaging strategies, it did not enable direct evaluation of the effects of imaging on patient management and outcomes. In this study, management after completing the diagnostic protocol was always based on the result of all diagnostic tests.

This study involved pre-imaging selection of patients, which should be considered when attempting to generalize the results. Most patients were referred to the emergency department by general practitioners. Additionally, patients discharged from the emergency department without imaging were not included in the analysis.

### Gastric trichobezoar: An important cause of abdominal pain presenting to the pediatric emergency department [^1145jtVn]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2003). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common presenting complaint in children seen in urgent care settings. It is the manifestation of a wide variety of disease processes, ranging from benign to immediately life-threatening. Gastric bezoars are among the causes of chronic childhood abdominal pain that, when undiagnosed, may result acutely in serious complications, including gastric ulceration, bleeding, and perforation, as well as intussusception and small bowel obstruction. To reinforce the importance of including this entity in the differential diagnosis of abdominal pain, we present the case of a 10-year-old girl with a history of chronic epigastric complaints. She was ultimately presented with acute small bowel obstruction following fragmentation and distal migration of her gastric trichobezoar. Finally, we review and briefly summarize the literature regarding the etiology, diagnosis, and management of this disorder in children.

### Abdominal pain in the emergency department: Missed diagnoses [^111FXtYL]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is the most common chief complaint in the Emergency Department. It is caused by a variety of gastrointestinal and nongastrointestinal disorders. Some frequently missed conditions include biliary pathology, appendicitis, diverticulitis, and urogenital pathology. The Emergency Medicine clinician must consider all aspects of the patient's presentation, including history, physical examination, laboratory testing, and imaging. If no diagnosis is identified, close reassessment of pain, vital signs, and physical examination is necessary to ensure safe discharge. Strict verbal and written return precautions should be provided to the patient.

### Insights into the evaluation and management of dyspepsia: Recent developments and new guidelines [^116vXvgx]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

Evaluating and managing dyspepsia involves understanding its scope as it refers to a range of upper gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, such as epigastric pain or burning, early satiety, and postprandial fullness. Patients with these symptoms can be categorized into three primary groups:

- **Uninvestigated dyspepsia**: Patients who have not yet undergone further investigation to reveal underlying diagnoses.
- **Organic or structural dyspepsia**: Investigation has revealed specific causes such as chronic Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, peptic ulcer disease, upper GI cancer, biliary and gallstone disease, and pancreatic disease, including pancreatic cancer. Management in these cases is disease-specific.
- **Functional dyspepsia (FD)**: No organic cause is found after investigations, leading to a diagnosis of FD, which includes conditions like the epigastric pain syndrome (EPS) and postprandial distress syndrome (PDS).

The challenge lies in determining which patients with uninvestigated dyspepsia require further tests, as well as managing patients whose tests fail to reveal an underlying organic diagnosis, thus categorizing them as having functional dyspepsia.

### Imaging strategies for detection of urgent conditions in patients with acute abdominal pain: Diagnostic accuracy study [^115Nrka8]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

Although imaging is widely applied in patients presenting with acute abdominal pain, imaging strategies had not previously been compared in a large prospective study of diagnostic accuracy. In this study, computed tomography (CT) led to the largest increase in accuracy after clinical evaluation. However, a conditional strategy with CT after negative or inconclusive ultrasonography resulted in the highest overall sensitivity, with only 6% of urgent conditions missed, and the lowest overall exposure to radiation.

We therefore recommend the use of ultrasonography as the initial investigation in the diagnostic evaluation of patients presenting with acute abdominal pain, followed by CT after negative or inconclusive ultrasonography.

### Poliprotect vs omeprazole in the relief of heartburn, epigastric pain, and burning in patients without erosive esophagitis and gastroduodenal lesions: A randomized, controlled trial [^113nB2v9]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

In conclusion, starting from the first day of treatment, Poliprotect proved noninferior to omeprazole in the relief of heartburn, epigastric pain, and burning during the initial two weeks, and even better on demand (on average 2–3 tablets per day) compared with omeprazole in the subsequent two weeks. In addition, Poliprotect on demand counteracted the predictable worsening of symptoms that follows the suspension of PPI treatment. Furthermore, the MPA is a 100% natural product and therefore biodegradable by definition, with no impact on the environment. In the present RCT, it showed high safety without affecting the gut microbiota.

In large-scale surveys aimed at the postmarketing surveillance of Poliprotect, 3,471 physicians and 848 patients did not report any serious adverse events. In addition, physicians largely reported good tolerability in the Poliprotect-treated population, which included pregnant women and children. Postmarket vigilance data reported an incidence rate of less than 1/10,000 of nonserious gastrointestinal and skin adverse effects of Poliprotect and no serious adverse effects. Based on the results of this trial and considering such a high safety level, it is conceivable that Poliprotect might be used as a first-line treatment for heartburn and EPS and to substitute PPI in those conditions in which they are contraindicated. However, further RCTs are required to assess whether Poliprotect has the potential to be indicated on a cost-benefit and cost-effective basis for the treatment of heartburn, epigastric pain, and burning in endoscopy-negative patients as an alternative to PPI.

### Tailoring diagnosis and treatment in symptomatic gallstone disease [^116szmQU]. The British Journal of Surgery (2022). Low credibility.

The outcome of cholecystectomy and cause of persistent abdominal pain

Table 2 summarizes patient characteristics and preoperative symptoms in patients with uncomplicated cholecystolithiasis. The data are based on three clinical trials (SECURE, PERFECT, and SUCCESS), which included patients between 2014 and 2019 in 30 Dutch hospitals.

The PERFECT and SUCCESS trials showed that laparoscopic cholecystectomy effectively resolved biliary colic. However, both trials confirmed that persistent abdominal pain after cholecystectomy is present in 40 percent of patients. Several causes of persistent abdominal pain after surgery have been identified. The literature suggests that several gastrointestinal symptoms originating from disease etiologies other than gallstones are responsible for the development of postcholecystectomy pain. Functional dyspepsia (FD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have a prevalence of 20–30 and 20 percent, respectively, in the primary care population. Both are causes of pain with similar pain characteristics. These conditions generally involve similar population groups: mainly middle-aged women who are overweight. These similarities complicate the diagnosis of the condition responsible for a patient's complaints and, as a result, potentially lead to abdominal pain being wrongfully attributed to gallstones and therefore influencing the choice of treatment (cholecystectomy).

### Acute pancreatitis due to erythromycin overdose [^115TvHUg]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2005). Low credibility.

Antibiotic overdose is typically regarded as a benign event. We report a 15-year-old girl who developed pancreatitis after an overdose of erythromycin.

- **Case**: A 15-year-old girl presented for care because of severe epigastric pain after an overdose of 5.3 g (16 x 333 mg tablets) of erythromycin base. Her physical examination was normal except for epigastric tenderness. Her serum lipase was 2024 U/L (normal, < 60). She was treated with intravenous fluids and an opiate analgesic. Her serum lipase declined to 1834 U/L and 73 U/L at 17 and 36 hours, respectively, after the initial measurement, at which time she was asymptomatic.

Our case supports transient pancreatitis as a potential consequence of erythromycin overdose.

### Oxaprozin [^116ydLqM]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Overdosage symptoms**: Symptoms following acute NSAID overdosage have typically included lethargy, drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, and epigastric pain, which have generally been reversible with supportive care. Gastrointestinal bleeding has occurred. Rare occurrences include hypertension, acute renal failure, respiratory depression, and coma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1, 5.2, 5.4, 5.6)].

- **Management**: Patients should be managed with symptomatic and supportive care following an acute NSAID overdosage. There are no specific antidotes available. It is advisable to contact a poison control center (1–800–222–1222) to determine the latest recommendations, as strategies for managing overdose are continually evolving.

- **Decontamination**: If gastric decontamination may be potentially beneficial, such as when the time since ingestion is short or in cases of large overdosage (5 to 10 times the recommended dosage), consider methods such as emesis and/or activated charcoal (60 grams to 100 grams in adults, 1 gram to 2 grams per kg of body weight in pediatric patients), and/or an osmotic cathartic in symptomatic patients. Due to high protein binding, forced diuresis, alkalinization of urine, hemodialysis, or hemoperfusion may not be useful.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^116xfwW3]. Gut (2022). Low credibility.

In the absence of alarm symptoms or signs, functional dyspepsia (FD) is highly probable when epigastric pain or burning, early satiation, and/or postprandial fullness are reported, in line with the Rome IV criteria. Endoscopy is unlikely to change the diagnosis, even though a normal endoscopy is required as part of these diagnostic criteria.

In routine clinical practice, therefore, clinicians can use the recently proposed Rome IV clinical criteria, which require the presence of one or more of these four cardinal symptoms if reported as bothersome for more than 8 weeks. Other symptoms can coexist but should not be predominant. Information about the characteristics of pain should be recorded. Usually, in FD, pain is in the upper abdomen or epigastrium and may be present in fasting conditions and/or precipitated or exacerbated by meal ingestion. Unlike in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), abdominal pain in FD is unrelated to the need to defecate.

All of this may help to differentiate patients with FD from those with IBS or to identify patients with FD with overlapping IBS, which can be of any subtype and is reported to occur in up to 50% of patients. In this situation, the patient will report the presence of two different types of abdominal pain: one related and one unrelated to defecation. Other functional bowel disorders, including functional diarrhea, functional constipation, or functional abdominal bloating and distension, can also overlap with FD. Gastro-oesophageal reflux symptoms also coexist in approximately one-third of patients with FD, and in this situation, evidence suggests that clinicians tend to favor a…

### Isolated spontaneous dissection of a visceral artery: A rare cause of epigastric pain [^112LqT1p]. Emergency Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Isolated spontaneous dissection of the celiac trunk or superior mesenteric artery is rarely considered in patients with acute abdominal pain. However, with advances in computed tomography (CT) technology, more cases are being detected.

- **Purpose**: The aim of this study was to describe the clinical manifestation and the classical CT features of isolated spontaneous celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) dissection.

- **Material and methods**: The records of seven patients were reviewed to assess demographic data, presenting symptoms, location of dissection, diagnostic modalities, imaging findings, complications, and treatment.

- **Results**: Six patients were men, with an average age of 57 years (range, 44–80). Six had epigastric pain, and one was asymptomatic. All were diagnosed by CT. The location of dissection was the celiac trunk in three patients and SMA in four. In all cases, the diagnosis was made by identifying an intimal flap on contrast-enhanced CT images. Extension of dissection to the hepatic artery was found in three patients.

	- A number of associated imaging findings were also present: infiltration of the fat surrounding the vessel (four cases), aneurysmal dilatation (six), thrombosed false lumen (four), significant stenosis (two), and additional aortic or visceral artery aneurysm (four). One patient had renal infarction 2 weeks after initial presentation.

Extensive evaluation of all patients revealed no serologic evidence to support the presence of vasculitis or an inflammatory disorder. All were treated conservatively with antihypertensive drugs and anti-inflammatory medications.

### Abdominal pain mimics [^116UPRpu]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2021). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is a common reason for emergency department visits, with many patients not receiving a definitive diagnosis for their symptoms. Non-gastrointestinal causes need to be considered in the workup of abdominal pain. A high index of suspicion is required to develop a broad differential, and a thorough history and physical examination is paramount. This article will discuss some of these diagnoses, including can't-miss diagnoses, common non-abdominal causes, and rare etiologies of abdominal pain.

### Dyspepsia: Management guidelines for the millennium [^111CCMKh]. Gut (2002). Low credibility.

The annual prevalence of dyspepsia in Western countries is approximately 25%, and the condition accounts for 2–5% of all primary care consultations. However, optimal management remains a subject of considerable debate. This discussion addresses some of the outstanding issues and considerations in the management of dyspepsia, providing an overview of thinking and recommendations on patient management by primary care physicians and specialists.

### Insights into the evaluation and management of dyspepsia: recent developments and new guidelines [^116VMsmH]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

The recent ACG/CAG guideline proposes a more pragmatic clinical definition of dyspepsia: predominant epigastric pain lasting at least 1 month, which may be associated with other upper GI symptoms such as epigastric fullness, nausea, vomiting, or heartburn, provided that epigastric pain is the patient's primary concern. However, this definition has not been validated in a clinical study, and it places the emphasis on the presence of epigastric pain, despite the extremely common reporting of postprandial symptoms by patients with dyspepsia.

- **The role of upper GI endoscopy**: Any uncertainty over whether a patient's dyspeptic symptoms have an organic or functional cause can, for the most part, be addressed by undertaking upper GI endoscopy, although in the case of suspected biliary or pancreatic disease, an abdominal ultrasound scan might also be necessary. However, a previous systematic review and meta-analysis has shown that more than 70% of people will be labelled as having FD following upper GI endoscopy. Instead, recent guidelines recommend the targeted use of endoscopic investigation in patients with specific indications.

### Abdominal pain in the elderly [^114wGRxk]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2006). Low credibility.

Elderly patients experiencing abdominal pain remain one of the most challenging patient populations. Signs and symptoms of serious disease are often nonspecific, and atypical presentations are common in elderly patients. In addition, the higher incidence of serious pathology in this population requires emergency physicians to be vigilant and thorough in their work-up. Vascular catastrophes are more likely to be seen in this population, and a broad differential diagnosis needs to be considered.

### Approach to acute abdominal pain [^1149qknL]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Evaluation of the emergency department patient with acute abdominal pain may be challenging. Many factors can obscure the clinical findings, leading to incorrect diagnosis and subsequent adverse outcomes. Clinicians must consider multiple diagnoses with limited time and information, giving priority to life-threatening conditions that require expeditious management to avoid morbidity and mortality. This article seeks to provide the clinician with the clinical tools to achieve these goals by reviewing the anatomic and physiological basis of abdominal pain and key components of the history and physical examination. In addition, this article discusses the approach to unstable patients with abdominal pain.

### Dyspepsia [^116ZHZ4r]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

This review critically evaluates the status of dyspepsia, particularly focusing on recent advances in epidemiology, pathophysiology, and management. The definition of dyspepsia, and functional dyspepsia in particular, remains contentious; the Rome III redefinition of functional dyspepsia has yet to be proven clinically valuable. Overlap with gastroesophageal reflux and irritable bowel syndrome further complicates clinical definitions.

Recent findings show that most studies of pathophysiology continue to focus on gastric sensory and motor functions. However, some intriguing early data suggest a potential infective or immunological contribution. There have been few significant treatment breakthroughs; recent studies mainly address the nuances of Helicobacter pylori eradication and acid suppressive strategies.

This continued lack of progress in the area leads one to question some basic concepts of this disorder, such as whether functional dyspepsia, as currently understood, truly exists as a distinct entity.

### Silent peptic ulcer disease: Frequency, factors leading to "silence", and implications regarding the pathogenesis of visceral symptoms [^115nq4sq]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2004). Low credibility.

Peptic ulcer disease may occur in the absence of dyspeptic symptoms. The pathogenesis of dyspepsia in peptic ulcer disease is unclear, and it has not been determined whether the presence of Helicobacter pylori infection or the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs affects dyspeptic symptoms in patients with peptic ulcer disease. The aim of the study was to determine the frequency and risk factors for peptic ulcer disease in a cohort of asymptomatic, unselected patients undergoing routine screening EGD.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective study of a cohort of Chinese subjects undergoing screening EGD as part of a routine health maintenance program. Routine EGD screening was performed in 6,457 consecutive subjects who underwent a self-paid health evaluation. Those with endoscopy-confirmed peptic ulcer disease were enrolled to assess the risk factors that distinguish asymptomatic patients with peptic ulcer disease from patients with symptoms due to peptic ulcer disease.

- **Results**: A total of 704 (10.9%) patients were found to have peptic ulcer disease, of which two thirds (n = 496) were asymptomatic. Both uni- and multivariate analysis showed that the asymptomatic patients tended to have a larger body mass index, to be habitual tea drinkers, and to have an ulcer that was less than 1 cm in diameter and in a healing stage. Gender, blood group, history of hypertension and/or diabetes, ulcer location, Helicobacter pylori status, use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatories or sedative medications, habitual coffee drinking, and habits with respect to smoking of tobacco or ingestion were also evaluated.

### Emergency laparoscopy — current best practice [^116ni8gB]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Non-specific abdominal pain: Whilst most patients presenting with abdominal pain will be diagnosed within a short period of assessment, there remains a cohort in whom the clinical picture remains equivocal. In these patients, depending on the severity of their symptoms, laparoscopy plays a role. If the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are relatively less concerning, then a period of observation may allow clarification of a diagnosis or simply cessation of the pain. However, in cases where observation is not safe due to the severity of the clinical findings, we advocate diagnostic laparoscopy.

The reasons for this are twofold. Firstly, converted-to-open cases have a similar outcome to primary laparotomy, thus minimizing potential negative effects of laparoscopy. Secondly, as discussed above, many common pathologies that may be the underlying cause of the non-specific abdominal pain are now best managed laparoscopically.

### British society of gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^114X64nF]. Gut (2022). Low credibility.

Functional dyspepsia (FD) presentation, diagnosis, and management primarily occur in primary care settings. As previously stated, most patients with dyspepsia will have FD as the underlying cause. Therefore, in both primary and secondary care, the term 'dyspepsia' is often synonymous with FD. In most of Europe, primary care serves as the first point of contact for patients presenting with dyspepsia, with many being managed exclusively in this setting. Gastrointestinal symptoms make up to 10% of consultations in primary care, with 50% related to upper gastrointestinal issues like dyspepsia. In the UK, there are approximately one million consultations per day in primary care; therefore, around 50,000 of these are likely for dyspepsia or other upper gastrointestinal symptoms. Patients in primary care frequently present with undifferentiated symptoms affecting various body systems, necessitating the general practitioner's (GP) role in formulating a working diagnosis to guide management.

Over the past 30 years, evolving definitions of dyspepsia have resulted in confusion among both GPs and gastroenterologists. Consequently, specific working diagnoses regarding the exact cause of dyspepsia are rarely made. Furthermore, FD remains a diagnosis of exclusion, typically confirmed via endoscopy, despite 80% of individuals with dyspepsia ultimately being diagnosed with FD after such procedures. However, endoscopy is not always readily available in primary care settings. GPs may be discouraged from requesting endoscopy due to long-waiting lists and financial considerations.

Clinicians should be aware that most patients with dyspepsia will have FD as the underlying cause of their symptoms.

### Antispasmodics for chronic abdominal pain: Analysis of North American treatment options [^115pQeHB]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Abdominal pain is the most common gastrointestinal (GI) symptom prompting an office-based outpatient or emergency department visit in the United States. Functional GI disorders, now more formally described as disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI), such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia (FD), and centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome (CAPS), are the underlying cause of abdominal pain in many patients.

IBS is a chronic disorder characterized by recurring abdominal pain associated with disordered bowel habits. According to Rome IV criteria, the diagnosis of IBS requires patients to have abdominal pain on ≥ 1 day per week in the previous 3 months.

FD is also a pain-predominant disorder. Rome IV diagnostic criteria for FD require patients to present with bothersome epigastric pain (≥ 1 day per week), epigastric burning (≥ 1 day per week), postprandial fullness (≥ 3 days per week), or early satiation (≥ 3 days per week) during the previous 3 months.

Centrally mediated abdominal pain syndrome is characterized by persistent abdominal pain that interferes with daily activities; it is not associated with altered bowel habits.

### Epigastric pain… it is not always alcohol! An unusual presentation of caecal intussusception [^115H9rf9]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

Our patient is a 19-year-old man who presented to the emergency department after consuming 50–60 units of alcohol over a weekend. He presented with a 2-day history of right-upper quadrant (RUQ) and epigastric pain radiating to the back. On examination, he was hemodynamically stable. His abdomen was soft with minimal tenderness in the RUQ, epigastric, and right-iliac fossa areas. Laboratory results showed a slightly raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate, while amylase and white cell count were normal. An ultrasound was performed, raising the suspicion of intussusception. A CT scan was recommended and confirmed the presence of an intussusception. Once the diagnosis was established, the patient underwent an emergency laparotomy and right hemicolectomy, with per-operative findings consistent with the CT findings. This case illustrates the importance of keeping an open approach to all differentials while considering a diagnosis. Recognizing intussusception is crucial, as complications can each represent a cause of mortality on their own.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines on the management of functional dyspepsia [^114UTqsE]. Gut (2022). High credibility.

Over the last 35 years, definitions of dyspepsia have evolved from a broad one, which included any symptom felt to be attributable to the stomach and duodenum, including heartburn, nausea, or vomiting, to one that includes only the cardinal symptoms of epigastric pain or burning, postprandial fullness, or early satiation (the feeling of fullness during ingestion of a meal, which acts as a terminating factor). Recent definitions recognize that belching, nausea, or upper abdominal bloating can also be present, but heartburn alone is not a symptom of dyspepsia, although it can coexist. Vomiting is atypical and, if present, should prompt consideration of another disorder. Functional dyspepsia (FD) is diagnosed in the absence of a structural abnormality to explain the symptoms. Therefore, to make a diagnosis, by definition, patients need to have been investigated to exclude evidence of organic, systemic, or metabolic disease.

Symptoms alone are not reliable in distinguishing functional from organic causes of dyspepsia. Nevertheless, 80% of people with dyspepsia will be diagnosed with FD following endoscopy. FD is defined according to symptom-based diagnostic criteria developed by the Rome Foundation and is classified into two distinct subtypes: postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) and epigastric pain syndrome (EPS). Clinically, the EPS subtype separates those with epigastric pain or burning, which is often present regardless of meals, from those with PDS who report early satiation and postprandial fullness, mainly triggered by meals.

### Dyspepsia [^111wArcH]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2012). Low credibility.

A variety of organic diseases can cause dyspepsia, but most patients with epigastric pain have functional dyspepsia. As dyspepsia is common and usually has a benign cause, it is not possible to fully investigate everyone with epigastric pain. Recommendations suggest that young patients without alarm symptoms can be treated empirically with Helicobacter pylori test and treat. Proton pump inhibitor therapy can be offered to those who are negative or remain symptomatic despite treatment for their H. pylori. Patients who remain symptomatic with this strategy may be investigated with endoscopy, but most will have functional dyspepsia.

- **Recent findings**: There are a large number of trials for prokinetic therapy in functional dyspepsia, but treatment efficacy is uncertain, as there is evidence of publication bias. There are very limited data for the effectiveness of tricyclic antidepressants in functional dyspepsia. There has been recent interest in the observation that patients with functional dyspepsia have increased eosinophils in the duodenum, and this may be accompanied by other subtle manifestations of upregulated mucosal immunity. It is possible that this is being driven by a dietary substance or by a change in the upper gut microbiome.

- **Summary**: The initial management of dyspepsia is well established, but how to manage those who do not respond is a challenge. Future studies evaluating diet and altering the gut microbiome may give clinicians more therapeutic options.
