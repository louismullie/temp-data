## Question

Prone positioning in patients with severe ARDS on VV ECMO

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether prone positioning during venovenous ECMO improves clinically meaningful outcomes in severe ARDS, and how to apply the evidence at the bedside. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and why we are combining prone positioning with ECMO. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence, especially randomized trials. Next, I will review observational data and meta-analyses for signals and confounding. After that, I need to examine physiological mechanisms and potential subgroups. Finally, I will align with guidelines and outline a practical, risk-stratified approach with explicit uncertainties and research gaps.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context and rationale. Severe ARDS carries high mortality, and both prone positioning and VV-ECMO independently improve outcomes in appropriately selected patients, which is why guidelines recommend prone for severe ARDS and consider ECMO for refractory cases after optimizing conventional therapy, including prone positioning before cannulation when feasible [^111ob81x] [^114oUghS] [^114ujwEj]. The question is whether adding prone during ECMO provides incremental benefit beyond ultra-protective ventilation and ECMO support itself, and whether that benefit is consistent across phenotypes and timing windows [^111Hczay].

> I will now examine the highest-quality evidence. The PRONECMO randomized clinical trial in 170 patients with severe ARDS on VV-ECMO found no significant difference in time to successful ECMO weaning by day 60, with 44.2% weaned in the prone group versus 44.0% in the supine group, and no differences in 90-day mortality or serious adverse events, despite protocolized prone sessions of at least four 16-hour sessions in the first 4 days [^113J5EDM] [^113CuMef]. Wait, let me verify the interpretation: the primary outcome was framed as time-to-event, but the reported statistic is a proportion at day 60; the curves show early separation that converges by day 60, which explains the neutral result and underscores that the trial was powered for a composite weaning endpoint rather than mortality, so a mortality signal could be missed [^113J5EDM] [^114ZMLfR].

> Next, I should review observational data and meta-analyses for signals and confounding. Multiple observational studies and pooled analyses suggest improved short-term survival with prone during ECMO, but these are vulnerable to immortal time, selection, and center effects; for example, a pooled individual patient data analysis of 889 patients showed lower unadjusted ICU mortality with prone but no significant association after adjustment, and a 2025 meta-analysis of 3,465 patients reported lower 28-day and hospital mortality with prone yet longer ECMO duration and fewer ventilator-free days, indicating substantial bias and indirectness [^115NUdp3] [^112ULqqe] [^114S9EHw]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: the consistency of a short-term mortality signal is intriguing, but the lack of RCT confirmation and the counterintuitive longer ECMO duration argue against causal inference here [^112ULqqe].

> I need to check physiological mechanisms to see if there is a plausible benefit despite neutral clinical outcomes. Prone positioning improves dorsal recruitment, ventilation–perfusion matching, and reduces ventilator-induced lung injury by homogenizing transpulmonary pressures; during ECMO, it can further reduce mechanical power and potentially improve right ventricular loading, though ultra-protective strategies already lower VILI risk, which may blunt the incremental benefit of prone in this context [^1134Pgmd] [^111Hczay]. Let me consider whether biomarkers changed: a randomized study of ultra-lung-protective ventilation with intermittent prone during ECMO did not show reduced biotrauma versus EOLIA-style ventilation, which tempers enthusiasm for routine prone solely to mitigate VILI during ECMO [^114qTNje] [^114FD7PF].

> But wait, what if timing or phenotype modifies the effect. Exploratory subgroup analyses suggest potential benefit with early prone during ECMO, in younger patients, in non-COVID ARDS, and in those not previously proned before cannulation, whereas COVID-19 cohorts and those already proned pre-ECMO may not benefit additionally; these are hypothesis-generating and should be interpreted cautiously given multiple testing and confounding [^115dcJEu] [^112ULqqe] [^116jCPz5]. I should double-check that these findings come from observational datasets and pooled analyses, not RCTs, so they cannot overturn PRONECMO's neutral result but may inform selective use in experienced centers [^112ULqqe].

> Next, I should review guidelines to ensure alignment. Contemporary ATS and ESICM guidance emphasize that prone positioning should be used for severe ARDS and that VV-ECMO is a conditional strategy for refractory cases after optimizing conventional therapy; neither guideline recommends routine prone positioning during ECMO, reflecting the limited and indirect evidence base and the need for more definitive trials [^114oUghS] [^114ujwEj] [^116d3tzL]. Hold on, I should verify that this applies across etiologies: yes, the recommendations are etiology-agnostic, though COVID-19 ARDS often involves longer ECMO courses and different lung mechanics, which may influence risk–benefit perceptions [^114oUghS].

> I will now translate this into a practical, risk-stratified approach. For patients already on ECMO, routine prone is not mandated; however, in experienced centers with trained teams, a therapeutic trial of prone may be reasonable for refractory hypoxemia, high mechanical power, or suspected ventilator-induced lung injury, ideally initiated early and with attention to safety protocols for cannula securement, pressure injury prevention, and hemodynamic monitoring [^115H6NwJ] [^111Hczay]. Let me reconsider the timing point: if prone is pursued, earlier initiation appears more promising in observational analyses, but I need to ensure we do not over-interpret nonrandomized data; shared decision-making and local expertise should guide use [^115dcJEu] [^112ULqqe].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties and research gaps. We still need adequately powered RCTs targeting hard outcomes like 90-day mortality, standardized timing and duration of prone sessions, and stratification by ARDS phenotype and pre-ECMO prone status; until then, the benefit of prone during ECMO remains unproven, and decisions should weigh potential physiologic gains against resource demands, staffing, and patient-specific risks [^116NWb1s] [^111Hczay]. I should confirm that ongoing and future trials are designed to address these questions; yes, PRONECMO and other studies have advanced the field, but larger, phenotype-informed trials are still needed to resolve this issue [^113J5EDM] [^116NWb1s].

Prone positioning during VV-ECMO for severe ARDS is **feasible and safe** [^113J5EDM], with consistent improvements in oxygenation and compliance [^115AoqCb] [^112xNcp9], but **does not reduce mortality or ECMO duration** in randomized trials [^113J5EDM]. Observational studies suggest possible survival benefit in selected subgroups (younger, non-COVID, early PP) [^112ULqqe] [^115dcJEu], but these findings are hypothesis-generating and not definitive [^112ULqqe]. Routine use is not supported; consider prone positioning for refractory hypoxemia or high ventilator strain in experienced centers, balancing risks such as pressure injuries and staffing needs [^115H6NwJ] [^1129jyUd].

---

## Physiological rationale for prone positioning during VV-ECMO

Prone positioning improves **oxygenation and compliance** via dorsal lung recruitment, better V/Q matching, and reduced VILI [^1134Pgmd] [^1164dMMM]. During VV-ECMO, it may further reduce mechanical power and VILI, though ultra-protective ventilation already lowers VILI risk [^111Hczay] [^1161sXGf].

---

## Clinical evidence on outcomes

### Randomized controlled trials (RCTs)

The PRONECMO RCT (170 patients, mostly COVID-19) found **no difference** in time to successful ECMO weaning, 90-day mortality, or ECMO duration between prone and supine groups [^113J5EDM] [^113CuMef]. A small RCT of ultra-lung-protective ventilation with intermittent prone during ECMO showed **no reduction in biotrauma** versus EOLIA-style ventilation, suggesting limited incremental benefit [^114qTNje] [^114FD7PF].

---

### Observational studies and meta-analyses

Observational studies and meta-analyses report **conflicting results**: some show improved 28-day and hospital mortality with prone during ECMO [^113o8Per] [^112ULqqe], whereas others show no survival benefit and longer ECMO duration, likely reflecting selection and immortal time bias [^115AoqCb] [^114S9EHw]. A 2025 meta-analysis of 3,465 patients found **lower 28-day and hospital mortality** with prone, but longer ECMO duration and fewer ventilator-free days, indicating low-certainty evidence and potential bias [^112ULqqe] [^114S9EHw].

---

## Safety and feasibility

Prone positioning during ECMO is **generally safe** when performed by trained teams, with low rates of major complications such as cannula dislodgement or bleeding [^113J5EDM] [^1129jyUd]. Common issues include pressure injuries, transient desaturation, and staffing demands, which are manageable with protocols and training [^1129jyUd] [^115H6NwJ].

---

## Patient selection and timing

Subgroup analyses suggest potential benefit in **younger patients**, those with **non-COVID ARDS**, **early PP after ECMO initiation** (≤ 5 days), and those not proned before cannulation [^112ULqqe] [^115dcJEu] [^116jCPz5]. Conversely, patients already proned before ECMO may not benefit from additional prone during ECMO [^116jCPz5] [^112pXXqy].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Guidelines do not recommend **routine prone positioning** during VV-ECMO; it may be considered case-by-case for refractory hypoxemia or high ventilator strain in experienced centers [^115H6NwJ] [^111Hczay]. Prone is **strongly recommended** for severe ARDS without ECMO, underscoring that ECMO-era evidence remains limited [^117Sz8oL] [^114y1A28].

---

## Practical considerations and implementation

- **Team training**: Essential for safe prone maneuvers, cannula security, and monitoring [^115H6NwJ].
- **Protocolized care**: Standardize sedation, positioning, and complication surveillance [^115H6NwJ].
- **Patient selection**: Use for refractory hypoxemia or high ventilator strain after weighing risks and benefits [^115H6NwJ].

## Summary of evidence

| **Outcome** | **Rcts** | **Observational studies/meta-analyses** |
|-|-|-|
| Mortality | No benefit (PRONECMO) [^113J5EDM] | Mixed; some suggest benefit, others none [^112ULqqe] [^115AoqCb] |
| ECMO duration | No reduction (PRONECMO) [^113J5EDM] | Longer ECMO duration reported [^115AoqCb] [^114S9EHw] |
| Oxygenation | Improved consistently [^115AoqCb] [^114KcVN9] | Improved consistently [^115AoqCb] [^114KcVN9] |
| Safety | Feasible and safe with training [^113J5EDM] [^1129jyUd] | Generally safe with low major complication rates [^113J5EDM] [^1129jyUd] |

---

Prone positioning during VV-ECMO improves oxygenation and is feasible, but **does not improve survival or ECMO duration** in RCTs [^113J5EDM]. Observational data suggest possible benefit in selected patients, but evidence is low quality and confounded; therefore, routine use is not supported. Use selectively in experienced centers for refractory cases, and enroll patients in trials when possible [^115H6NwJ] [^116NWb1s].

### Comparison of venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, prone position and supine mechanical ventilation for severely hypoxemic acute respiratory distress syndrome: a network meta-analysis [^1175isxe]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with PaO₂/FiO₂ < 80 mmHg is a life-threatening condition. The optimal management strategy is unclear. The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the effects of low tidal volumes (Vₜ), moderate Vₜ, prone ventilation, and venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) on mortality in severe ARDS.

Methods

We performed a frequentist network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with participants who had severe ARDS and met eligibility criteria for VV-ECMO or had PaO₂/FiO₂ < 80 mmHg. We applied the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology to discern the relative effect of interventions on mortality and the certainty of the evidence.

Results

Ten RCTs including 812 participants with severe ARDS were eligible. VV-ECMO reduces mortality compared to low Vₜ (risk ratio [RR] 0.77, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.59–0.99, moderate certainty) and compared to moderate Vₜ (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.57–0.98, low certainty). Prone ventilation reduces mortality compared to moderate Vₜ (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.66–0.93, high certainty) and compared to low Vₜ (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.63–1.02, moderate certainty). We found no difference in the network comparison of VV-ECMO compared to prone ventilation (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.72–1.26), but inferences were based solely on indirect comparisons with very low certainty due to very wide confidence intervals.

Conclusions

In adults with ARDS and severe hypoxia, both VV-ECMO (low to moderate certainty evidence) and prone ventilation (moderate to high certainty evidence) improve mortality relative to low and moderate V t strategies. The impact of VV-ECMO versus prone ventilation remains uncertain.

### Prone positioning during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with severe ARDS: the PRONECMO randomized clinical trial [^113J5EDM]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Prone positioning may improve outcomes in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but it is unknown whether prone positioning improves clinical outcomes among patients with ARDS who are undergoing venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) compared with supine positioning.

Objective

To test whether prone positioning vs supine positioning decreases the time to successful ECMO weaning in patients with severe ARDS supported by VV-ECMO.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized clinical trial of patients with severe ARDS undergoing VV-ECMO for less than 48 hours at 14 intensive care units (ICUs) in France between March 3, 2021, and December 7, 2021.

Interventions

Patients were randomized 1:1 to prone positioning (at least 4 sessions of 16 hours) (n = 86) or to supine positioning (n = 84).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was time to successful ECMO weaning within 60 days following randomization. Secondary outcomes included ECMO and mechanical ventilation-free days, ICU and hospital length of stay, skin pressure injury, serious adverse events, and all-cause mortality at 90-day follow-up.

Results

Among 170 randomized patients (median age, 51 [IQR, 43–59] years; n = 60 women [35%]), median respiratory system compliance was 15.0 (IQR, 10.7–20.6) mL/cm H₂O; 159 patients (94%) had COVID-19-related ARDS; and 164 (96%) were in prone position before ECMO initiation. Within 60 days of enrollment, 38 of 86 patients (44%) had successful ECMO weaning in the prone ECMO group compared with 37 of 84 (44%) in the supine ECMO group (risk difference, 0.1% [95% CI, -14.9% to 15.2%]; subdistribution hazard ratio, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.71–1.75]; P = 0.64). Within 90 days, no significant difference was observed in ECMO duration (28 vs 32 days; difference, -4.9 [95% CI, -11.2 to 1.5] days; P = 0.13), ICU length of stay, or 90-day mortality (51% vs 48%; risk difference, 2.4% [95% CI, -13.9% to 18.6%]; P = 0.62). No serious adverse events were reported during the prone position procedure.

Conclusions and Relevance

Among patients with severe ARDS supported by VV-ECMO, prone positioning compared with supine positioning did not significantly reduce time to successful weaning of ECMO.

### Prone positioning during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115AoqCb]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Prone positioning (PP) improves oxygenation and respiratory mechanics and is associated with lower mortality in patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Despite this, some patients develop refractory hypoxemia and hypercapnia requiring venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) support and are usually cared for in supine position. The physiologic and outcome benefits of routine PP of patients during VV ECMO remains unclear. Hence, we conducted the systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the outcome benefits of PP for patients with ARDS being treated with VV ECMO.

Methods

After registration with PROSPERO (CRD42020199723), MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus and Cochrane databases were searched for relevant studies that reported PP in more than 10 adult patients supported with VV ECMO from origin to 1 March 2021. Studies were reviewed for quality using appropriate Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklists, and certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. The random-effects model (DerSimonian and Laird) was used. The primary outcome of interest was cumulative survival. Secondary outcomes were intensive care unit length of stay (ICU LOS) and ECMO duration. Changes in arterial blood gas (ABG) values, ventilator mechanics and complication rates were also studied.

Results

Of 812 potentially relevant publications, 12 studies (640 patients) met our inclusion criteria. Due to overlapping study populations, 11 studies were included in the final meta-analysis. Cumulative survival in patients that underwent PP was 57% (95% CI 41.9–71.4, high certainty). Patients that underwent PP had longer ICU LOS (+14.5 days, 95% CI 3.4–25.7, p = 0.01) and ECMO duration (+9.6 days, 95% CI 5.5–13.7, p < 0.0001). After PP, patients had significantly higher PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio, lower PaCO₂ and reduced ventilator driving pressure, and no major complications were reported.

Conclusions

PP during VV ECMO appears safe with a cumulative survival of 57% and may result in longer ECMO runs and ICU LOS. However, evidence from appropriately designed randomized trials is needed prior to widespread adoption of PP on VV ECMO.

### Effect of prone position in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome supported by venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a retrospective cohort study [^114J1XKb]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The application of prone position (PP) in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) supported by venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) is controversial.

Objectives

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of application of PP during VV-ECMO in patients with ARDS.

Methods

This was a single-center, retrospective study of patients who met the Berlin definition of ARDS, and were supported with VV-ECMO. We divided the patients into two groups. The prone group included patients who were supported by VV-ECMO, and experienced at least one period of PP, while those without PP during VV-ECMO were defined as the supine group. Propensity score matching (PSM) at a ratio of 1:1 was introduced to minimize potential confounders. The primary outcomes were the complications of PP and the change of arterial oxygen pressure/fraction of the inspiration (PaO₂/FiO₂) ratio after PP. The secondary outcomes were hospital survival, ICU survival, and ECMO weaning rate.

Results

From April 2013 to October 2020, a total of 91 patients met the diagnostic criteria of ARDS who were supported with ECMO. 38 patients (41.8%) received at least one period of PP during ECMO, while 53 patients (58.2%) were maintained in supine position during ECMO. 22 minor complications were reported in the prone group and major complications were not found. The other ECMO-related complications were similar between two groups. The PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio significantly improved after PP compared with before (174.50 (132.40–228.25) mmHg vs. 158.00 (122.93–210.33) mmHg, p < 0.001). PSM selected 25 pairs of patients with similar characteristics. Hospital survival or ICU survival did not differ between the two groups (40% vs. 28%, p = 0.370; 40% vs. 32%, p = 0.556). Significant difference of ECMO weaning rate between two groups was not found (56% vs. 32%, p = 0.087).

Conclusions

PP during VV-ECMO was safe and could improve oxygenation. A large-scale and well-designed RCT is needed in the future.

### Effect of prone positioning on survival in adult patients receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113o8Per]. Intensive Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Previous studies support the potential efficacy of venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vvECMO) for improving survival in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) cases. Prone positioning (PP) has been shown to improve the outcomes of moderate-to-severe ARDS patients. Few studies and no randomized controlled trials have evaluated the effect of PP performed in ECMO patients.

Methods

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis examining the effect of prone positioning for ARDS patients receiving vvECMO on survival. All authors were contacted to obtain complementary information not mentioned in the original articles. The main objective was to compare 28-day survival in vvECMO patients with PP to vvECMO patients without PP (controls).

Results

Thirteen studies with a combined population of 1836 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. PP was associated with a significant improvement in 28-day survival (503 survivors among 681 patients in the PP group [74%; 95% CI 71–77] vs. 450 survivors among 770 patients in the control group [58%, 95% CI 55–62]; RR 1.31 [95% CI 1.21–1.41]; I² 22% [95% CI 0–62%]; P < 0.0001). Survival was also improved in terms of other endpoints (60-day survival, 90-day survival, ICU survival, and hospital survival). In contrast, the duration of mechanical ventilation was increased in vvECMO patients with PP (mean difference 11.4 days [95% CI 9.2–13.5]; 0.64 [95% CI 0.50–0.78]; I² 8%; P < 0.0001).

Conclusion

According to this meta-analysis, survival was improved when prone positioning was used in ARDS patients receiving vvECMO. The impact of this combination on survival should be investigated in prospective randomized controlled trials.

### Efficacy and safety of prone positioning in patients undergoing extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO): a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113sSszn]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung condition characterized by diffuse alveolar damage and hypoxemia. Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vv-ECMO) supports gas exchange and reduces ventilator-induced injury, while prone positioning (PP) improves oxygenation by optimizing ventilation-perfusion matching.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis, following PRISMA guidelines, using MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. Studies included were on adult ARDS patients undergoing vv-ECMO with PP. Outcomes measured were survival rates, ECMO weaning, duration of ECMO support, mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital stays, and complications.

Results

Seventeen studies met inclusion criteria. While ECMO+PP improved 30-day and hospital survival rates, there was no significant improvement in 60-day survival, 90-day survival, ICU survival, or ECMO weaning rates. ECMO+PP significantly enhanced oxygenation parameters and reduced PaCO₂ levels. Earlier and more frequent PP sessions shortened mechanical ventilation and ICU stays. Non-COVID patients had better 30-day survival with ECMO+PP than COVID patients.

Conclusions

Combining PP with ECMO improves early but not long-term survival in severe ARDS, especially in non-COVID patients, while extending duration of mechanical support and stays. Further prospective randomized trials are needed to confirm these findings.

### Prone positioning during veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116DxYbf]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Methods

Full details regarding the study methods are described in the electronic supplementary material 1. Reporting of this systematic review and meta-analysis conforms to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement (electronic supplementary material 2). This systematic review was registered in PROSPERO on March 9th, 2024 (CRD42024517602).

Inclusion and exclusion criteria

For study selection, the following participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS) question was employed: participants were adult (i.e. ≥ 18 years old) patients receiving V-V ECMO for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure; the intervention was at least one session of prone positioning; the comparison was no prone positioning; the primary outcome was 28-day mortality, while secondary outcomes were intensive care unit (ICU), hospital, 60-day, 90-day, and 6-month mortality, the duration of ECMO cannulation, the need for re-cannulation, 28-, 60-, and 90-day ventilator-free days (as defined in the original study), the duration of invasive mechanical ventilation (as defined in the original study), the need for tracheostomy, ICU and hospital length of stay, and ECMO-related adverse events; eligible study designs were RCT and non-RCT. Studies on extracorporeal configurations different from V-V ECMO, not comparing prone positioning with a control group, and with no data on mortality at any time-point were excluded. Finally, when studies with overlapping patients' cohorts were identified, the study describing the largest cohort was the only one included.

Literature search

We performed an electronic search of Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception until September 1st, 2024 with no language restrictions. Grey literature was screened through Google Scholar, OpenGrey, and MedRxiv. Conference proceedings of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, the Society of Critical Care Medicine, the American Thoracic Society, and the Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) were searched from 2014 to the present. ClinicalTrials.gov and PROSPERO registries were also examined. All references of included articles and related reviews were hand-searched.

Controlled vocabulary terms (when available), text words, and keywords were variably combined with blocks of terms per concept, as follows: ("extracorporeal membrane oxygenation") AND ("prone positioning"). Medline and Scopus search strategies were adapted for searches in other databases (electronic supplementary material 3).

### Prone positioning during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112hAt74]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Prone positioning during ECMO for ARDS has a cumulative survival of 57% suggesting that patients undergoing PP during ECMO may have clinically meaningful benefits. However, the heterogeneity of outcomes in included studies may indicate that the treatment effects of PP on VV ECMO may vary between patients. Furthermore, the intervention leads to longer ECMO runs and ICU LOS. To what extent combining PP during ECMO extends ECMO duration and ICU length of stay warrants further investigation. The timing of PP during ECMO as well as the duration of PP needed to achieve a meaningful clinical benefit is currently unclear. Future studies should identify the patients who are likely to benefit most from PP before adoption of PP routinely in select patients undergoing ECMO for ARDS.

### Prone positioning during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute respiratory distress syndrome: a pooled individual patient data analysis [^114a3PxS]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prone positioning (PP) has proven to reduce mortality of patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Previous studies suggested that the survival benefit of prone positioning is greater in the most hypoxemic patients. Among these patients, a further worsening of respiratory failure or the impossibility of maintaining protective ventilation may require extracorporeal gas exchange, specifically venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO). However, patients on V-V ECMO support have historically been managed in supine position, because of the fear of life-threatening complications associated with prone positioning during extracorporeal support and lack of experience. Recently, numerous teams have reported feasibility of PP during V-V ECMO, which might be associated with an improvement of oxygenation, CO₂ clearance and respiratory system compliance. Several European cohort studies evaluated the association between PP during ECMO and outcome, with conflicting results.

Two randomized controlled studies are currently undergoing in China (NCT04139733) and France (NCT04607551) to prospectively assess the impact of this procedure on duration of ECMO support and time to successful weaning from ECMO. Both studies will assess mortality as a secondary endpoint. However, since these two studies recently started patient recruitment, results will not be available soon. Until then, physicians may wonder if PP should be considered a reasonable treatment adjunct for ARDS patients on venovenous extracorporeal support. The expanding use of ECMO during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic also urge to get a better knowledge of the effect of this procedure on outcomes.

We performed a pooled individual patient data analysis of five European cohort studies comparing severe ARDS patients treated with PP during V-V ECMO to "conventional" ECMO management in the supine position. The primary aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of PP during ECMO on ICU mortality.

### Prone positioning during venovenous ECMO for severe ARDS… [^1134Pgmd]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Care of patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure receiving mechanical ventilation has advanced significantly in the last 25 years due to a focus on minimization of iatrogenic injury, largely ventilator-induced lung injury. In addition to limitation of tidal volumes and airway pressures, the use of prone positioning is a technique for lung protection. 1 Regional variability predisposes to overdistension of nondependent and cyclical opening and closing of dependent lung regions, which in turn drive ventilator-induced lung injury. 2 Prone-position ventilation induces changes in chest wall and respiratory system compliance, improving gas exchange and lung mechanics. Over a series of clinical trials, clinicians and scientists learned that longer daily application of prone positioning in patients with moderate to severe hypoxemia culminated in the large mortality reduction demonstrated in the PROSEVA trial.

3 Prone positioning improved oxygenation on average in that trial, but there was no association between changes in oxygenation and survival, further supporting that the main benefit of prone positioning is less ventilator-induced lung injury. 4 The use of routine prone positioning is strongly recommended in current clinical practice guidelines.

### Prone positioning during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute respiratory distress syndrome: a pooled individual patient data analysis [^115NUdp3]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Prone positioning (PP) reduces mortality of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The potential benefit of prone positioning maneuvers during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between the use of prone positioning during extracorporeal support and ICU mortality in a pooled population of patients from previous European cohort studies.

Methods

We performed a pooled individual patient data analysis of European cohort studies which compared patients treated with prone positioning during ECMO (Prone group) to "conventional" ECMO management (Supine group) in patients with severe ARDS.

Results

889 patients from five studies were included. Unadjusted ICU mortality was 52.8% in the Supine Group and 40.8% in the Prone group. At a Cox multiple regression analysis PP during ECMO was not significantly associated with a reduction of ICU mortality (HR 0.67 95% CI: 0.42–1.06). Propensity score matching identified 227 patients in each group. ICU mortality of the matched samples was 48.0% and 39.6% for patients in the Supine and Prone group, respectively (p = 0.072).

Conclusions

In a large population of ARDS patients receiving venovenous extracorporeal support, the use of prone positioning during ECMO was not significantly associated with reduced ICU mortality. The impact of this procedure will have to be definitively assessed by prospective randomized controlled trials.

### Prone position during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: survival analysis needed for a time-dependent intervention [^117Ce6cy]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

To the Editor,

We read with great interest the paper of Giani and colleagues titled "Prone positioning during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute respiratory distress syndrome: a pooled individual patient data analysis" published in the critical care journal. We are surprised that their meta-analysis failed to show a survival benefit for prone positioning during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO). We would like to postulate that this was due to the limitation of the statistical methods.

Prone positioning patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) for an extended time during their illness has been shown to reduce their 28 and 90-day mortality. This is thought to be due to a combination of improved ventilation/perfusion matching, better distribution of transpulmonary pressures, reduced pulmonary vascular resistance, and right ventricular afterload. In addition, respiratory system compliance is improved directly through enhanced lung compliance and indirectly through reducing chest and abdominal wall pressure. More importantly, prone positioning may reduce ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Despite these benefits, prone ventilation remains underutilized; only 33% of patients in the APRONET trial, a large multicenter study of patients, with severe ARDS were placed in prone position.

The same physiologic benefits for prone positioning have been shown during VV ECMO support for severe ARDS. Despite this, observational outcome studies are conflicting, showing both improved and worsened survival. In an observational analysis of 25 ECMO patients with COVID-19 severe ARDS, prone positioning showed improved oxygenation but a higher mortality rate which was attributed to the severity of illness. Meta-analysis is a standard technique to reduce differences between treatment groups by increasing sample size. However, Giani and colleagues did not find an improvement in outcome with prone positioning during VV ECMO. We believe this could be due to failing to consider the temporal properties of prone ventilation, despite an adequate sample size of 889 patients. Our survival analysis of 232 VV ECMO patients in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Critical Care Consortium international registry showed prone positioning during ECMO was associated with a reduced probability of death (hazard ratio, 0.31; 95% CI 0.14–0.68). Our results are consistent with the meta-analysis of 1836 patients from thirteen studies, which showed prone positioning of VV ECMO patients with severe ARDS led to reduced mortality at 28, 60-, and 90-days.

### Prone positioning in severe ARDS requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [^112wdBr4]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Prone positioning (PP) has shown to improve survival in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). To this point, it is unclear if PP is also beneficial for ARDS patients treated with veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) support.

Methods

We report retrospective data of a single-centre registry of patients with severe ARDS requiring VV ECMO support between October 2010 and May 2018. Patients were allocated to the PP group if PP was performed during VV ECMO treatment or the supine positioning group. VV ECMO weaning success and hospital survival were analysed before and after propensity score matching.

Results

A total of 158 patients could be analysed, and 38 patients (24.1%) received PP. There were no significant differences in VV ECMO weaning rate (47.4% vs. 46.7%, p = 0.94) and hospital survival (36.8% vs. 36.7%, p = 0.98) between the prone and supine groups, respectively. The analysis of 38 propensity score matched pairs also showed no difference in hospital survival (36.8% vs. 36.8%, p = 1.0) or VV ECMO weaning rate (47.4% vs. 44.7%, p = 0.82). Hospital survival was superior in the subgroup of patients treated with early PP (cutoff < 17h via Youden's Index) as compared to late or no PP (81.8% vs. 33.3%, p = 0.02).

Conclusion

In this propensity score matched cohort of severe ARDS patients requiring VV ECMO support, prone positioning at any time was not associated with improved weaning or survival. However, early initiation of prone positioning was linked to a significant reduction of hospital mortality.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^111PHjKp]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

VV-ECMO facilitates oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal in patients with ARDS by draining blood from the venous system, allowing it to pass through a gas-exchange device, and then returning it to the venous system. It is an invasive, resource-intensive technology available at specialized centers that incurs significant cost and requires a considerable amount of human health resources. The use of VV-ECMO has increased substantially during the past several years, with notable increases seen after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and subsequently during the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2017 ATS guidelines addressed VV-ECMO in patients with ARDS but found insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against its use. Since that time, a multicenter RCT evaluating the effect of early initiation of VV-ECMO on patients with severe ARDS was published, prompting an updated recommendation.

Evidence summary

VV-ECMO was evaluated in two RCTs that included 429 patients. In the first trial, 180 patients were randomized to conventional ARDS management or referral for consideration of VV-ECMO, with follow-up at 6 months; a specific management protocol was not mandated in the control arm. In the second trial, 249 patients were randomized to VV-ECMO or conventional management and followed for 60 days. Ventilator management was protocolized in the control arm, and the use of neuromuscular blockade and prone positioning was encouraged. Pooled analysis demonstrated that VV-ECMO probably decreased mortality at the latest follow-up (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.60–0.95; moderate certainty) and probably increased ventilator-free days (MD, 8 d more; 95% CI, 2–15; moderate certainty), vasopressor-free days (MD, 8 d more; 95% CI, 3–13; moderate certainty), and renal replacement therapy–free days (MD, 7 d more; 95% CI, 2–13; moderate certainty). With regard to safety outcomes, VV-ECMO probably increased the risk of hemorrhage (RR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.17–2.31; moderate certainty), but may have little to no effect on the risk of pneumothorax (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.61–2.12; low certainty) and an uncertain effect on the risk of stroke (RR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.10–1.39; very low certainty).

### Prone positioning during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1164dMMM]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Prone positioning (PP) has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The PROSEVA trial reported significantly lower 28- and 90-day mortality in patients that underwent PP, when compared with supine positioning in patients with ARDS. It has also been postulated that survival benefits of prone ventilation are independent of improvement in gas exchange and that it results from the ability of PP to reduce ventilator induced lung injury (VILI). Multiple mechanisms have been proposed to account for this effect, including reduction in alveolar overinflation and equalization of pleural pressure, leading to parenchymal homogeneity and better oxygenation. PP relieves lung stress and improves respiratory mechanics by offloading the pressure of the heart and abdominal contents on the diaphragm leading to enhanced clearance of pulmonary secretions and reduced lung injury.

The role of venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) in the management of ARDS has changed from being a rescue therapy to a more definitive therapy in the recent years. It has a more decisive role in the management of hypoxemia that is refractory to standard management that includes low tidal volume ventilation, paralytic agents and PP. While both VV ECMO and PP have independently been shown to improve patient outcomes in ARDS, the combination of both therapies has not been studied in great detail. The risks and benefits of enhancing lung recruitment during refractory hypoxemia on VV ECMO is still unclear. Equally, it is not fully clear to what extent PP improves pulmonary mechanics and right ventricular function and whether these improvements result in meaningful clinical benefits. Additionally, the limited literature available on the use of PP during VV ECMO has suggested great variability in patient selection and outcomes, with some depicting improvement in PaO₂/FiO₂ ratios but highlighting failure to improve respiratory compliance as well as increased ECMO-related complications. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the use of PP during ECMO for adult ARDS aiming to gain a better understanding of the inter-therapeutic relationship and evaluate patient survival on this regimen.

Domain 9: Extracorporeal life support

Question 9.1: In adult patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or COVID-19 does veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) compared with conventional ventilation improve outcomes?

Background

VV-ECMO is used to support or replace gas exchange. During ECMO, blood is passed through a "membrane lung" which facilitates exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide by diffusion. Technological improvements have led to improved gas exchange and reduced complications. ECMO has been used for patients with severe ARDS including more recently patients with COVID-19. High-volume expert centers report better outcomes with ECMO. It is likely that an overall package of care delivered alongside the use of ECMO, including lung-protective ventilation and prone positioning, is required to achieve improved outcomes in patients receiving ECMO.

Summary of the evidence

Two randomized controlled trials informed the basis of these recommendations. The CESAR trial included 180 patients, and the EOLIA trial included 249 patients with ARDS. The EOLIA inclusion criteria were as follows: a PaO₂/FiO₂ < 50 mmHg for > 3 hours, or a PaO₂/FiO₂ of < 80 mmHg for > 6 hours, or a pH of < 7.25 with a PaCO₂ of ≥ 60 mmHg for > 6 hours, with the respiratory rate increased to 35 breaths per minute and mechanical ventilation settings adjusted to keep a plateau pressure of ≤ 32 cm H₂O.

These studies included patients with severe ARDS of any etiology (average PaO 2 /FiO 2 values were approximately 75 mmHg), though both were conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. The EOLIA and CESAR trials were considered clinically sufficiently homogenous to be meta-analytically combined. According to the RoB2 tool, there was a high risk of bias with the CESAR trial, as about one-quarter of patient in the intervention arm did not receive ECMO.

### Comparative effectiveness of protective ventilation strategies for moderate and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. A network meta-analysis [^11237DY7]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Rationale: Choosing the best ventilation strategy for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is complex, yet it is highly relevant to clinicians during a respiratory pandemic. Objectives: To compare the effects of low Vt, high Vt, high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), prone ventilation, high-frequency oscillation, and venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) on mortality in ARDS. Methods: We performed a network meta-analysis of randomized trials. We applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology to discern the relative effect of interventions on mortality. Measurements and Main Results: We analyzed 34 trials including 9,085 adults with primarily moderate-to-severe ARDS (median baseline PaO₂/FiO₂, 118; interquartile range, 110–143). Prone positioning combined with low Vt was the best strategy (risk ratio [RR], 0.74 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.60–0.92] vs. low Vt; high certainty). VV ECMO was also rated among the best (RR, 0.78 [95% CI, 0.58–1.05] vs. low Vt; RR, 0.66; [95% CI, 0.49–0.88] vs. high Vt) but was rated with lower certainty because VV ECMO was restricted to very severe ARDS (mean baseline PaO₂/FiO₂ < 75). High PEEP combined with low Vt was rated intermediately (RR, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.81–1.03] vs. low Vt; low certainty; RR, 0.77 [95% CI, 0.65–0.91] vs. high Vt; moderate certainty). High Vt was rated worst (RR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.02–1.37] vs. low Vt; moderate certainty), and we found no support for high-frequency oscillation or high Vt with prone ventilation. Conclusions: These findings suggest that combining low Vt with prone ventilation is associated with the greatest reduction in mortality for critically ill adults with moderate-to-severe ARDS.

### Prone positioning during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1172TdPv]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Patients who undergo PP during ECMO have been shown to have significantly prolonged duration of ECMO support as well as ICU LOS It is likely that the patients subjected to PP during ECMO were sicker, which explains the need for the intervention as well as the longer duration of ECMO. Given the immortal time bias associated with interventions like ECMO, it is also plausible that sicker patients could have died earlier and thus did not undergo prone positioning, thereby accounting for the higher mortality. It is possible that PP, by alleviating VILI, may prevent ongoing native lung damage. When this is associated with improvements in gas exchange, it may lead to improvements in right ventricular function and overall hemodynamics, thereby mitigating non-pulmonary organ failure. It was established that patients who underwent PP had greater extrapulmonary organ failure-free days up to 28 days after randomization in the PROSEVA trial. It should also be noted that the control group mortality in some of the studies in our review that included a comparator arm was higher than reported in the treatment arm of the EOLIA trial and may account for the higher survival in patients with prone positioning seen in this analysis.

The survival rates reported in our analysis (57%) are less than that of EOLIA trial, which did not conduct PP in patients with ECMO. We also note that patients who were not treated with PP during VV ECMO had a lower pooled survival of 47% (95% CI 33.4–61.8), however, the calculated chances of survival between PP and control groups were statistically non-significant. Whether this is attributable to a greater severity of illness, or the variability in institutional workflows could not be ascertained from our review. In the absence of randomized controlled trials investigating the effect of PP with VV ECMO, it is difficult to conclusively determine if PP during VV ECMO has meaningful benefits. Nonetheless, the higher survival rates seen in patients undergoing PP during ECMO reported in this analysis are hypothesis generating for a future controlled trial. Routine PP of patients on VV ECMO and PP of patients with refractory hypoxia on VV ECMO represent two different clinical situations. Therefore, future controlled trials (ClinicalTrials.gov, ref. NCT04139733, NCT04607551) will have to test the risk to benefit ratio of routine PP during VV ECMO, focusing on patient centered outcomes. Prior to such a trial, standardization of data collection as well as patient management on VV ECMO, duration and timing of the PP sessions, as well as homogenizing the ECMO weaning criteria will be critical.

### Prone positioning during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with severe ARDS… [^116RMXFx]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Question Prone positioning may improve the outcome of patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, but is prone position superior to supine position among patients receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe ARDS. Findings. In this randomized clinical trial that included 170 patients primarily with COVID-19 who were undergoing VV-ECMO, successful ECMO weaning at day 60 occurred in 38 patients in the prone ECMO group compared with 37 patients in the supine ECMO group, a nonsignificant difference. Meaning Among patients with severe ARDS undergoing VV-ECMO, prone positioning did not reduce time to successful ECMO weaning compared with supine position.

Importance Prone positioning may improve outcomes in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, but it is unknown whether prone positioning improves clinical outcomes among patients with ARDS who are undergoing venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation compared with supine positioning. Objective To test whether prone positioning vs supine positioning decreases the time to successful ECMO weaning in patients with severe ARDS supported by VV-ECMO. Design, Setting, and Participants Randomized clinical trial of patients with severe ARDS undergoing VV-ECMO for less than 48 hours at 14 intensive care units in France between March 3, 2021, and December 7, 2021. Interventions Patients were randomized 1: 1 to prone positioning or to supine positioning. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was time to successful ECMO weaning within 60 days following randomization.

Secondary outcomes included ECMO and mechanical ventilation–free days, ICU and hospital length of stay, skin pressure injury, serious adverse events, and all-cause mortality at 90-day follow-up. Conclusions and Relevance Among patients with severe ARDS supported by VV-ECMO, prone positioning compared with supine positioning did not significantly reduce time to successful weaning of ECMO.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^114oUghS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) in adult acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — pre-ECMO measures, candidate criteria, and center considerations: Less invasive therapies recommended for ARDS, such as lung protective ventilation, higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), neuromuscular blockade, and prone positioning, should be used before the consideration of VV-ECMO. Candidate features include very severe hypoxemia (PaO₂/FIO₂ ratio < 80 mm Hg) or hypercapnia (pH < 7.25 with PaCO₂ ≥ 60 mm Hg) despite optimal conventional management, being early in the disease course (early (< 7 d)), and having few risk factors for futility; for patients meeting these criteria at facilities without ECMO capability, transfer to ECMO centers should be considered when feasible. Equity and resource issues are noted, with reported disparities in patient selection and variability in feasibility, cost effectiveness, and acceptability across centers and health systems. A higher institutional case volume is associated with improved outcomes; accordingly, VV-ECMO should be provided in high-volume, dedicated centers, and programs should be organized on a regional level wherever possible to provide the safest and most efficient care.

### Effect of prone position in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome supported by venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a retrospective cohort study [^114Z5Thc]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a type of acute, diffuse, inflammatory lung injury that is characterized by the rapid development of hypoxemia, and is associated with high mortality and high health care costs especially in the intensive care unit (ICU). Prone position (PP) as a postural therapy can optimize respiratory mechanics, improve ventilation-perfusion matching, ameliorate the right ventricular function, and reduce the risk of ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) via reduction of the stress and strain across the lungs. The Positioning Severe ARDS Patients (PROSEVA) study demonstrated that early and prolonged mechanical ventilation in PP was associated with significant survival advantage for patients with severe ARDS. As a potent salvage therapy, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) rests the lungs and reduces the risk of VILI for severe patients with ARDS. The individual participant data meta-analysis of the ECMO to Rescue Lung Injury in Severe ARDS (EOLIA) and the Conventional Ventilatory Support versus Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Severe Adult Respiratory Failure (CERSA) trials supported the efficacy of ECMO for patients with ARDS in improving survival rate.

The above studies demonstrated better prognoses of patients with ARDS who were treated by ECMO or PP, while the safety and efficacy of combination of these two therapies has not been evaluated. In clinical practice, the use of PP in patients with ARDS supported by ECMO is limited by lack of experience and potential risk of serious complications, such as bleeding from cannula insertion sites, dislodgment, and decrease of extracorporeal blood flow or extreme hemodynamic instability etc. Previous studies reported that PP during ECMO was safe and improved oxygenation. However, in recent years, efficacy evaluation tended to focus on survival rate and ECMO weaning rate, and the results of studies were controversial.

Thus, we performed a retrospective analysis of PP in patients with ARDS supported by ECMO, which aimed to evaluate the safety and efficacy. The primary outcomes were the safety of PP during ECMO and the change of arterial oxygen pressure/fraction of inspiration (PaO₂/FiO₂) ratio after PP. The secondary outcomes were hospital survival, ICU survival, and ECMO weaning rate.

### Prone positioning in severe ARDS requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [^114FACZy]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

In case of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) support may be considered when lung-protective mechanical ventilation is not able to prevent hypoxia or hypercapnia. Nevertheless, mortality of severe ARDS remains high — even with ECMO support. The EOLIA trial for instance showed a mortality rate of 35% in patients treated with ECMO compared to 46% in patients without ECMO support in very severe ARDS.

Moreover, several studies showed that prone positioning (PP) is able to improve survival in these critically ill patients. PP provides various positive effects on oxygenation and lung compliance. Furthermore, PP can reduce ventilator-induced lung injury and is associated with less days on mechanical ventilation (MV) and shorter length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay.

Hence, PP might be beneficial for patients receiving ECMO support. It has been demonstrated that PP can be performed safely during ECMO support and improves oxygenation and lung compliance. So far, there is little evidence about the outcome of these patients. We performed a retrospective analysis of ARDS patients treated with PP during ECMO support at our centre.

### Prone positioning during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with severe ARDS: the PRONECMO randomized clinical trial [^113CuMef]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

The study PRONECMO was published by Matthieu Schmidt and colleagues in 2023 in the journal JAMA. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute respiratory distress syndrome and COVID-19 infection. In the PRONECMO study, the trial question was: what is the role of prone positioning in patients with severe ARDS supported by venovenous ECMO? In the PRONECMO study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the PRONECMO study, the population was: 170 patients (60 female, 110 male). The inclusion criteria were patients with severe ARDS undergoing venovenous ECMO for < 48 hours. The key exclusion criteria were age < 18 years or > 75 years; pregnancy and lactation; initiation of venovenous ECMO > 48 hours prior; end-stage chronic lung disease; ARDS secondary to abdominal surgery; a moribund condition or a Simplified Acute Physiology Score value > 90; contraindications for prone positioning. In the PRONECMO study, the interventions were: n = 86 prone ECMO (placement in a prone position during ECMO for at least four 16-hour sessions during the first 4 days) n = 84 supine ECMO (placement in a supine position for the duration of ECMO). In the PRONECMO study, the primary outcome was: no significant difference in the rate of successful ECMO weaning by day 60 (44.2% vs. 44%; HR 1.11, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.75). In the PRONECMO study, the secondary outcomes were: no significant difference in the rate of pneumothorax by day 60 (16% vs. 21%; RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.53) No significant difference in death at day 90 (51% vs. 48%; RR 1.1, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.69) No significant difference in mean days receiving ECMO during first 90 days (27.51 days vs. 32.19 days; MD -4.9, 95% CI -11.2 to 1.5). In the PRONECMO study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in bleeding event requiring packed RBC transfusion, hemorrhagic stroke. significant difference in ≥ 1 cardiac arrest by day 60 (3.5% vs. 13.1%). In the PRONECMO study, the conclusion was: in patients with severe ARDS undergoing venovenous ECMO for < 48 hours, prone ECMO was not superior to supine ECMO with respect to the rate of successful ECMO weaning by day 60.

### Prone positioning during veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112ULqqe]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The evidence supporting the benefit on clinical outcomes of prone positioning during veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO) for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure remains inconclusive. We aimed to assess the association of prone positioning, compared to no prone positioning, with 28-day mortality and other clinical outcomes in different patient subgroups.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized and non-randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using a random-effects model was conducted. An electronic database search up to September 1st, 2024 was performed (PROSPERO CRD42024517602). The RoB 2 and ROBINS-I tools were used for risk of bias assessments.

Results

We analyzed two RCTs and 20 non-RCTs (3,465 patients). Compared to no prone positioning, the use of prone positioning was associated with lower 28-day (odds ratio [OR] 0.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42–0.98, p = 0.040, I² = 66%, low certainty of evidence [CoE]) and hospital mortality (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54–0.83, p < 0.001, I² = 39%, low CoE), despite fewer 28-day ventilator-free days and longer ECMO duration. Younger age (p = 0.005), a higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score (p = 0.022), non-Covid-19 etiology (p = 0.003), and lower rates of prone positioning before cannulation (p = 0.049) were associated with a greater benefit from prone positioning.

Conclusion

In this analysis, among patients supported with V-V ECMO for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, we observed improved 28-day and hospital mortality in those who received prone positioning, compared to those who did not. However, these findings do not imply causation. Further research is needed to clarify the role of prone positioning in this population.

### Lower Vt and prone position: quo vadis? [^112bPeVb]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

The burden of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in ICUs has increased dramatically during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. As the management of ARDS is basically supportive, accurate and adequate delivery of mechanical ventilation is of primary importance to prevent further lung damage that could compromise patient outcome. The basic tenet of mechanical ventilation in patients with ARDS is to protect the lung by using low Vand positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). In a previous trial and subsequent meta-analyses, delivering lung protective ventilation in the prone position in moderate to severe ARDS was found to be beneficial to the patient outcome. Despite its beneficial effects, however, prone positioning is not widely used in patients with ARDS. To close the loop between scientific evidence and clinical practice, rigorous assessment and implementation of mechanical ventilation–associated interventions are key.

In this issue of the Journal, Sud and colleagues (pp.) show clinically relevant data. The authors performed a network meta-analysis of randomized trials to decipher the contribution of V, PEEP, prone ventilation, high-frequency oscillation, and venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) on hospital mortality in moderate to severe ARDS not related to COVID-19. They enriched the network meta-analysis technique by adding an assessment of the certainty of evidence to its conventional metrics. The study included 34 trials totalizing 9,085 patients with mortality data available. The main finding was that the low Vₜ–prone strategy was significantly better than the low Vₜ strategy alone (relative risk, 0.74 [0.6–0.92]). This comparison also showed a high certainty of evidence. The low Vₜ strategy, considered the standard care reference, was defined as a Vₜ ≤ 8 ml/kg predicted body weight and a PEEP amount adjusted according to the ARMA trial. Among all the strategies and compared with standard care, low V–prone was classified as the most effective approach and high Vas the least effective, both with high confidence. VV-ECMO was rated as possibly among the most effective strategies for very severe ARDS (PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio ≤ 75 mm Hg), but the level of confidence was low as only two trials were analyzed.

Given these controversial findings and the increasing adoption of prone positioning during V-V ECMO, a comprehensive and updated analysis of its impact on clinical outcomes is warranted. The primary aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to assess the association between prone positioning, as opposed to no prone positioning, and 28-day mortality in adult patients receiving V-V ECMO for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. The secondary aims are to clarify whether: (1) this technique is associated with improvement in other clinical outcomes, such as hospital mortality, duration of ECMO, and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation, and (2) certain patient subgroups are more likely to benefit from its implementation.

### Prone position during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: survival analysis needed for a time-dependent intervention [^113X3Ut9]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

This inconsistency could be a failure to address the fact that prone positioning has temporal dimensions, having both a duration and a time course in the patient's illness journey. We used a multistate survival model to address this issue, which is a more realistic model of patient progression through their journey. Patients in prone positioning can move to the supine state and vice versa, and this transition contributes to the complexity of the model and eventually affects the outcome. Hazard ratios from the survival model provide an estimate for transitions between states. A survival approach can account for the average time spent in the prone position, the number still at risk over time, and the probability of transitions. It can also account for the effect of multiple confounders on the transition and outcomes while accounting for the key confounder of time prone positioning began. Analyzing time-dependent treatments using cross-sectional groups that ignore time (e.g. "any prone during stay" and "no prone during stay") can cause significant biases in the effects of the treatment. These cross-sectional comparisons are confounded by time in ICU, which predicts both the probability of receiving prone treatments, and key outcomes such as death and length of stay.

In conclusion, we believe that prone positioning is beneficial for VV ECMO patients with Covid-19 ARDS and continue to recommend its use. Consideration of the temporal aspects of prone ventilation such as day of initiation, time of day of proning, the duration of prone positioning, and number of proning episodes is essential in both retrospective analyses and future randomized controlled clinical trials.

### Efficacy of proning in acute respiratory distress syndrome on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [^117PL2wn]. JTCVS Techniques (2022). Medium credibility.

Chart demonstrating outcomes from proning during ECMO.

Central Message

Proning in patients with ARDS on ECMO is safe and shows improvement in lung mechanics. With planning and coordination, these data support the practice of proning patients with severe ARDS on ECMO.

Perspective

A large number of patients were proned at a single institution for ARDS. Which patients would benefit from proning remains to be determined. However, if the primary barriers to offering proning are lack of experience and concerns regarding safety, then, once those hurdles have been overcome, the possibility will exist to expand to trials and further investigations that may answer those questions.

Prone positioning of patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been associated with improved survival. The physiologic effects of proning are improved oxygenation, decreased ventilator-associated lung injury, and improved compliance. While the benefits in ARDS have been demonstrated, the efficacy and safety of proning patients with severe ARDS requiring venovenous (VV) extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) remains unknown.

Recently, with the coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic, the rate of ARDS has increased significantly in the past year. In patients with COVID-19 ARDS, patients who were on mechanical ventilation had improved oxygenation when proned. However, many patients with COVID-19 had severe ARDS that required VV-ECMO support, with current data demonstrating poor overall survival of 40% to 60% in this subset. This increased demand for ECMO during the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need to further define the role of proning while on ECMO.

Given the lack of data regarding the role and safety of proning patient on ECMO, our institution selectively proned patients with COVID-19 who were cannulated for ECMO. In this study, we will describe the patient population that was proned, evaluate pulmonary mechanics with resultant changes in ECMO settings, and report the safety of proning while on ECMO support.

### Assessment of therapeutic interventions and lung protective ventilation in patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116ajfJk]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Introduction

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a lethal condition whereby the lung is injured by direct (eg, pneumonia or aspiration) or indirect (eg, extrapulmonary sepsis) insults. Clinically, patients with ARDS develop severe hypoxemia and/or hypercapnia, and most die of sepsis or multiorgan failure rather than from refractory respiratory failure. Acute respiratory distress is an important public health problem. A global epidemiologic studyreported that 10.4% of total intensive care unit admissions and 23.4% of all patients who were intubated had ARDS, with an associated hospital mortality of 40%.

Since the first description of ARDS in 1967, a number of approaches to its management have been evaluated and used clinically. Despite more than 50 years of research, to our knowledge, none of the treatments currently available are aimed directly at the pathophysiological mechanism resulting in acute respiratory failure (ie, increased alveolar capillary permeability); current approaches are mainly supportive. Perhaps most important has been the recognition that although mechanical ventilation is critical for the survival of patients with ARDS, it can also be injurious (ie, ventilator-induced lung injury). Indeed, lung protective ventilation (LPV), using low tidal volumes and airway pressures to mitigate ventilator-induced lung injury, is considered the mainstay of management in patients with ARDS.

In 2017, clinical practice guidelines on mechanical ventilation in adult patients with ARDS were published for 6 individual interventions, as follows: (1) LPV, (2) higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), (3) lung recruitment maneuvers (RMs), (4) high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV), (5) prone positioning, and (6) venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO). However, for clinicians, choosing between potentially efficacious treatments can be challenging if the treatments have not been directly compared in clinical trials (eg, prone positioning vs VV ECMO). Moreover, 4 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) — the Alveolar Recruitment for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Trial (ART), the ECMO to Rescue Lung Injury in Severe ARDS (EOLIA) trial, the Esophageal Pressure-Guided Ventilation 2 (EPVent2) trial, and the Reevaluation of Systemic Early Neuromuscular Blockade (ROSE) trial — have been published since the guidelines were completed. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis to compare different therapeutic strategies simultaneously to identify the best strategy associated with a reduction in mortality and to rank those therapeutic modalities for adult patients with moderate to severe ARDS.

### Timing of prone positioning during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute respiratory distress syndrome [^115dcJEu]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To assess the association of timing to prone positioning (PP) during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO) with the probability of being discharged alive from the ICU at 90 days (primary endpoint) and the improvement of the respiratory system compliance (Cpl, rs).

Design

Pooled individual data analysis from five original observational cohort studies.

Setting

European extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) centers.

Patients

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients who underwent PP during ECMO.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

Time to PP during V-V ECMO was explored both as a continuous and a categorical variable with Cox proportional hazard models. Three hundred patients were included in the analysis. The longer the time to PP during V-V ECMO, the lower the adjusted probability of alive ICU discharge (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.90 for each day increase; 95% CI, 0.87–0.93). Two hundred twenty-three and 77 patients were included in the early PP (≤ 5 d) and late PP (> 5 d) groups, respectively. The cumulative 90-day probability of being discharged alive from the ICU was 61% in the early PP group vs 36% in the late PP group (log-rank test, p < 0.001). This benefit was maintained after adjustment for confounders (adjusted HR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.66–3.81; p < 0.001). In the early PP group, PP was associated with a significant improvement of Cpl, rs (4 ± 9 mL/cm H₂O vs 0 ± 12 in the late PP group, p = 0.038).

Conclusions

In a large cohort of ARDS patients on ECMO, early PP during ECMO was associated with a higher probability of being discharged alive from the ICU at 90 days and a greater improvement of Cpl, rs.

### Prone positioning during veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^1161sXGf]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Prone positioning has been shown to improve ventilation-perfusion matching, mitigate ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI), improve right ventricular function, and enhance secretion clearance. Since the PROSEVA Trial, which demonstrated that early application of prone ventilation for at least 16 h per day reduced 28- and 90-day mortality in patients with moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), prone positioning has been strongly recommended.

Prone positioning during veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO) has been rarely used over the years. However, during the Coronavirus disease (Covid)-19 pandemic, the adoption of prone positioning during V-V ECMO increased, with a peak of 58% of patients during the first half of 2021.

During V-V ECMO, prone positioning has been shown to improve oxygenation secondary to increased dorsal alveolar recruitment and better ventilation-perfusion matching. However, the routine institution of prone positioning during V-V ECMO remains controversial.

First, prone positioning during V-V ECMO requires staff training and may lead to adverse effects, such as pressure sores, bleeding, airway dislodgement, decreased ECMO flow, and desaturation. Second, the mitigation of VILI when prone positioning is applied during ECMO-related ultra-protective mechanical ventilation, i.e. the reduction in the intensity of mechanical ventilation below the current standard of care, may be negligible. A small randomized controlled trial (RCT) (39 patients) observed no significant differences in biomarkers of VILI when ultra-protective ventilation, including 16 h of prone positioning, was compared with the ventilator settings of the EOLIA trial's ECMO arm. Third, during ultra-protective mechanical ventilation and low gas flow, the redistribution of alveolar stress and strain leading to the minimization of VILI with prone positioning may be less effective. Finally, the evidence supporting the benefit of prone positioning during V-V ECMO on clinical outcomes remains inconclusive. A systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2022 showed prone positioning to be associated with better survival at 28-day and other time-points. Nonetheless, in a recent high-quality RCT, compared to supine positioning, prone ventilation did not increase the rate of successful ECMO weaning by day 60 nor improve 60- or 90-day mortality.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^114ujwEj]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Because VV-ECMO is a resource-intensive therapy, there are several considerations for implementation (Figure 2). First, less invasive therapies recommended for ARDS, such as lung protective ventilation, higher PEEP, neuromuscular blockade, and prone positioning, should be used before the consideration of VV-ECMO because their use may obviate escalation of treatment. Furthermore, selection criteria for VV-ECMO should be carefully considered and focus on maximizing access for the individuals most likely to benefit from its use, specifically those with reversible etiologies of respiratory failure and very severe hypoxemia (PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio < 80 mm Hg) or hypercapnia (pH < 7.25 with PaCO₂ ⩾60 mm Hg) despite optimal conventional management, who are early (< 7 d) in their ARDS course, and have few risk factors for futility of treatment. For patients meeting these criteria who present to facilities without ECMO capabilities, transfer to ECMO centers should be considered when feasible. However, it is important to note that real-world patient selection criteria and access to ECMO centers are variable, and this variability may have serious implications for health equity. Indeed, disparities in patient selection based on insurance status, income, and gender have been reported. Finally, there may be considerable variability in feasibility, cost effectiveness, and acceptability for different centers and health systems. Because of its resource-intensive nature with regard to staffing, equipment, and costs, VV-ECMO has the potential to divert resources from other institutional needs, a factor that should be considered by established ECMO centers, those considering new ECMO implementation, and policy makers. Additionally, a higher institutional case volume is associated with improved outcomes. Accordingly, ECMO should be provided in high-volume, dedicated centers, and efforts should be made to organize ECMO programs on a regional level wherever possible to provide the safest and most efficient care.

### Prone positioning during veno-venous or veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: feasibility and complications after cardiothoracic surgery [^1129jyUd]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is a standard treatment for refractory hypoxaemia (veno-venous ECMO, VV-ECMO) and cardiogenic shock (veno-arterial ECMO, VA-ECMO). Severe hypoxaemia may persist despite ECMO. Prone positioning (PP) can improve outcomes of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, few data exist on PP in hypoxaemic patients receiving VV-ECMO or VA-ECMO, particularly after cardiothoracic surgery. Here, we evaluated oxygenation and complications seen with PP during ECMO.

We retrospectively studied consecutive patients managed with PP and ECMO between August 2014 and December 2020. PP was used in patients with either refractory hypoxaemia (PaO₂/FiO₂ < 80 despite 100% FiO₂ on ECMO) or persistent hypoxaemia (FiO₂ requirement ≥ 80% with ECMO and lung condensations by CT). PP was chosen in patients on VA-ECMO because an additional venous cannula would have decreased arterial flow, potentially causing intolerance and, in the event of posterior basal pulmonary condensation, inducing adverse effects. We recorded ventilation and ECMO parameters, reason for PP, and complications. FiO₂ ECMO, FiO₂ ventilator, and PaO₂ were collected before, during, and 6–12 h after PP.

Of 556 patients managed with ECMO, 34 (6.1%) (25 VV-ECMO, 9 VA-ECMO) received PP during ECMO (Table 1). PP significantly improved oxygenation (Fig. 1). Of the 87 PP sessions, six (6.9%) were followed by severe complications requiring emergent treatment. No patient experienced ECMO decannulation. Grade 3 or 4 pressure sores developed on the face or trunk in six (18%) patients. Of the 34 patients, nine (26%) died in the ICU. No patient died after ICU discharge. Of the 522 patients who received ECMO without PP, 237 (45.4%) died in the ICU, and median ECMO duration was 7 days [4–12].

### Prone positioning during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^114KcVN9]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis on the use of PP during ECMO in adult patients with ARDS. Patients who underwent PP during ECMO had a cumulative survival rate of 57%, less than the survival reported in the ECMO to Rescue Lung Injury in Severe ARDS (EOLIA) trial. PP during ECMO also resulted in improved oxygenation without an improvement in respiratory mechanics. However, PP resulted in an increased duration of ECMO run by 9.6 days and ICU LOS by 14.5 days and was comparable with some of the observational studies. Metaregression analysis identified no significant factors associated with survival for PP during ECMO.

PP has shown survival benefits in patients with ARDS by various mechanisms, however, the utility of this intervention during ECMO raises many questions. Franchineau et al. used electric impedance tomography (EIT) to describe the impact of PP in patients receiving VV ECMO and noted progressive redistribution of tidal volumes and end-expiratory lung impedance from ventral to dorsal regions with improvements seen in static lung compliance. While we observed that gas exchange indices and driving pressure improved from PP during ECMO, other respiratory mechanics including compliance or plateau pressure did not change significantly despite the maneuver. However, given that few included studies comprehensively report these parameters, it may be difficult to draw reliable conclusions on the protective mechanism of PP. It is possible that an improved oxygenation may have resulted from an improved ventilation: perfusion matching upon PP.

### Prone positioning during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute respiratory distress syndrome: a pooled individual patient data analysis [^114SAuG2]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

The propensity score matching method was applied to estimate the effect of PP during ECMO on main outcomes. Details on matching technique are provided in the Supplemental Methods (see Electronic Supplementary Material). Difference in 60-day survival probability was estimated between matched Prone and Supine groups by the Kaplan–Meier approach and compared by the log-rank test. For the matched cohorts we also described ICU and hospital mortality, rate of successful ECMO weaning, ICU length of stay and duration of time to successful ECMO weaning within 60 days from ECMO start.

To explore the potential role of prone positioning in specific subgroups of ECMO patients, we evaluated the association between Prone and Supine groups with hospital mortality in pre-defined clinically relevant subgroups. Patients were then classified according to age (age > 50); obesity (cutoff: BMI > 30 kg/m²); SOFA score (SOFA > 12); baseline PaO₂/FiO₂ > 60; use of prone position before ECMO; duration of mechanical ventilation before ECMO (> to 7 days).

Statistical significance was reported with a p-value < 0.05 (two-sided). Statistical analyses were performed using STATA/MP 16.0 for Windows (StataCorp LLC, College Statio, TX 77,845, USA) and GraphPad Prism 8 for Windows (version 8.0.2, GraphPad Software, Inc.).

### Unproven and expensive before proven and cheap: extracorporeal membrane oxygenation versus prone position in acute respiratory distress syndrome [^113rUaDR]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

We identified 810 reports that describe extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and 61 fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The authors of 26 (43%) reports responded to e-mail requests for confirmation (or clarification). Based on the aggregate (published and e-mailed) information, unambiguous data were available relating to 17 papers. These 17 papers represented 672 patients with ARDS who were cannulated with venovenous ECMO; of these patients, 208 (31%) received a trial of prone positioning before ECMO, and 464 (69%) did not. A key randomized controlled trial was published in 2013 that reported a survival benefit associated with prone positioning (N Engl J Med 2013;368:2159–2168). The proportion of all venovenous ECMO patients in whom prone positioning was used before ECMO was lower in studies published after 2013 (84 of 452 [19%]) than in those published before 2013 (116 of 210 [55%]) (P < 0.05). These data suggest a systematic bias in the reporting of outcomes after ECMO in the literature. The vast majority of reported patients who received ECMO did not first receive therapy that (in contrast to ECMO) is simple, cheap, and of proven benefit; therefore, inferences about the efficacy of ECMO in ARDS are of limited use.

### Assessment of therapeutic interventions and lung protective ventilation in patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^112x5ipU]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Importance

A number of interventions are available to manage patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). However, the associations of currently available ventilatory strategies and adjunctive therapies with mortality are uncertain.

Objectives

To compare and rank different therapeutic strategies to identify the best intervention associated with a reduction in mortality in adult patients with moderate to severe ARDS.

Data Sources

An electronic search of MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process/ePubs Ahead of Print, Embase, Cochrane Controlled Clinical Trial Register (Central), PubMed, and CINAHL was conducted, from database inception to May 29, 2019.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials of interventions for adults with moderate to severe ARDS that used lung protective ventilation. No language restrictions were applied.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Data were independently extracted by 2 reviewers and synthesized with Bayesian random-effects network meta-analyses.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Barotrauma was a secondary outcome.

Results

Among 25 randomized clinical trials evaluating 9 interventions, 2686 of 7743 patients (34.6%) died within 28 days. Compared with lung protective ventilation alone, prone positioning and venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were associated with significantly lower 28-day mortality (prone positioning: risk ratio, 0.69; 95% credible interval, 0.48–0.99; low quality of evidence; venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: risk ratio, 0.60; 95% credible interval, 0.38–0.93; moderate quality of evidence). These 2 interventions had the highest ranking probabilities, although they were not significantly different from each other. Among 18 trials reporting on barotrauma, 448 of 6258 patients (7.2%) experienced this secondary outcome. No intervention was superior to any other in reducing barotrauma, and each represented low to very low quality of evidence.

Conclusions and Relevance

This network meta-analysis supports the use of prone positioning and venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in addition to lung protective ventilation in patients with ARDS. Moreover, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may be considered as an early strategy for adults with severe ARDS receiving lung protective ventilation.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1165k5QQ]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Justification and implementation considerations

Although pooled analysis demonstrated a benefit from ECMO, with moderate certainty of the evidence of decreased mortality and days of organ support, there were multiple considerations that prompted a conditional recommendation, including the limitations of available data and practical concerns. The CESAR (Conventional Ventilatory Support versus Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation for Severe Adult Respiratory Failure) trial had several limitations, including the lack of standardized ventilator management in the control arm and a substantial number of patients randomized to VV-ECMO not receiving the intervention. Additionally, the CESAR trial predated the establishment of prone positioning as a guideline-recommended adjunctive therapy, and its use was limited in this trial. For these reasons, the certainty of evidence was downgraded from moderate to low for indirectness. Additionally, there is considerable variability in center experience, pre-ECMO care, and outcomes, leading to uncertainty about the real-world generalizability of data obtained from both trials, which were conducted at high-volume, expert ECMO centers.

### To prone or not to prone ARDS patients on ECMO [^114qexZH]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The prone position is recommended as a supportive therapy in patients with moderate- to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is usually associated with improved oxygenation and pulmonary mechanics as the result of a more homogeneous distribution of mechanical forces and better ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) matching. These effects lead to a lower risk of aggravating preexisting lung injury and, ultimately, a decrease in mortality. Despite widespread use of the prone position in patients with ARDS, even in awake non-intubated spontaneously breathing patients, its use dramatically decreases once the patient has been placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). In this chapter, we discuss the available evidence regarding use of the prone position in ARDS patients treated with ECMO.

### Prone positioning during veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111ZEvRP]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The main findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis, including 22 studies (2 RCTs and 20 non-RCTs) and 3465 patients supported with V-V ECMO for ARDS, are as follows. First, lower 28-day mortality was observed in patients who received prone positioning, compared to those who did not (low CoE). This observation does not imply causation, but rather reflects the data collected in this analysis. Second, despite longer ECMO duration (low CoE) and fewer 28-day ventilator-free days (very low CoE), hospital mortality was lower in patients who underwent prone positioning (low CoE), while 60-day, 90-day, and 6-month mortality showed no difference. Third, the following covariates were associated with a greater benefit from prone positioning during ECMO: younger age, a higher SOFA score, non-Covid-19 ARDS, and lower percentages of patients receiving prone positioning before cannulation. Fourth, no significant difference between the two groups was observed regarding the rate of successful ECMO weaning and ECMO-related adverse events and with respect to 60-day and 90-day ventilator-free days.

In our study, patients supported with V-V ECMO who received prone positioning exhibited better short-term survival rates compared to those who did not. Surprisingly, this result was observed despite the lower 28-day ventilator-free days in the prone positioning group, which are keeping with the previous meta-analysis by Papazian et al. Additionally, ECMO duration was longer when prone positioning was applied during V-V ECMO, which is a novel finding. If prone positioning obtained a mitigation of VILI, shorter courses of invasive mechanical ventilation and ECMO should be expected with this technique. The interpretation of these findings is not straightforward. Notably, 28-day ventilator-free days and ECMO duration were secondary outcomes in our study; therefore, we cannot be certain we included all the studies assessing these outcomes. Furthermore, the beneficial effects of prone positioning might require time to develop and patients undergoing prone positioning may require longer ECMO and mechanical ventilation courses.

Conclusions

This network meta-analysis supports the use of prone positioning and VV ECMO in addition to LPV in patients with moderate to severe ARDS and severe ARDS, respectively. In addition, our results are consistent with recent data suggesting that VV ECMO may be considered as an early strategy for adults with severe ARDS.

### Setting and monitoring of mechanical ventilation during venovenous ECMO [^115H6NwJ]. Critical Care (2023). Medium credibility.

Prone Positioning During ECMO

Prone position is an effective first-line intervention in moderate to severe ARDS that should be considered mandatory before ECMO consideration. However, this procedure during ECMO is still controversial, despite its increasing use, especially during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Several observational studies and a recent meta-analysis have shown that prone positioning during ECMO was feasible, safe, and could enhance ECMO weaning and improve outcomes. To date, the lack of RCTs, the fear of accidental decannulation, and the difficulties of routinely training the nursing staff in this procedure are still barriers to generalizing its use in ECMO patients, especially in centers with low ECMO volume. The results of the ongoing randomized controlled PRONECMO trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04607551) may help clarify the indications for prone positioning of ECMO patients.

### Prone positioning during veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116jCPz5]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Only 51% of patients were proned before ECMO cannulation. This is quite surprising, considering that prone positioning is relatively simple, cheap, and effective in patients with ARDS. This percentage is in keeping with that observed by Li et al. in studies published before the PROSEVA Trial (55%), but much higher than that observed in studies published between 2013 and 2018 (19%).

Higher 28-day mortality rates were observed in patients who underwent prone positioning before ECMO. In cases where respiratory failure progresses to ECMO despite prior prone positioning, our data do not provide evidence that additional prone positioning trials improve outcomes. Moreover, patients with a higher SOFA score showed better 28-day survival with prone positioning. Both these findings are in keeping with the results of the exploratory analysis of a pooled individual patient data study from five European cohort studies, overall including 889 patients.

A previous meta-analysis, including 13 studies and 1836 patients, found prone positioning during V-V ECMO to be associated with improved survival at 28 days, ICU and hospital discharge, 60 days, and 90 days. We believe our work has some strengths compared to the previously published meta-analysis, e.g. the three-year longer literature search (September 2024 vs. September 2021), the larger patient population (3465 vs. 1836 patients), and the inclusion of the only two RCTs designed to compare prone positioning vs. no prone positioning in patients supported with V-V ECMO, among these the recent high-quality PRONECMO Study. Moreover, we did not include some studies on Covid-19 patients supported with V-V ECMO because of the risk of overlapping patients' cohorts with another included study. The authors of the previous systematic review did not specify their approach for studies with overlapping cohorts. Finally, we investigated more outcomes, such as ECMO duration and ECMO-related complications, and performed more sensitivity analyses to test the robustness of our findings, as well as subgroup analyses and meta-regressions to investigate the origin of statistical and clinical heterogeneity.

### Emergency medicine updates: acute respiratory distress syndrome [^115sP8aS]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a critical condition associated with severe morbidity and mortality. There are several components of management, and it is important for emergency clinicians to be aware of these as they manage critically ill patients who may face extended time in the emergency department.

Objective

This paper evaluates evidence-based updates concerning ARDS.

Discussion

ARDS is a condition associated with diffuse, severe lung inflammation resulting in hypoxemic respiratory failure. While there have been several definitions, the most recent conceptual model is based on the revised Berlin definition and incorporates risk factors, the underlying etiology, timing, chest imaging, and oxygenation. Management is primarily based on ventilation and oxygenation, with literature demonstrating that low tidal volumes (4–8 mL/kg of predicted body weight) with plateau pressure ≤ 30 cm H₂O are associated with improved outcomes, and settings should be optimized to target driving pressure < 15 cm H₂O. Resuscitation with intravenous fluids should be individualized, though overall a net neutral-to-negative fluid balance may be beneficial. Steroids should be considered in those with moderate-to-severe ARDS within 14 days of onset, but administration past 14 days after ARDS onset may worsen outcomes. Neuromuscular blocking agents may be used in those with severe ARDS and refractory hypoxemia or ventilator dyssynchrony. Prone positioning should be considered in patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS who fail to improve despite lung-protective ventilation or in those with high ventilator settings and should ideally be performed for at least 12–16 consecutive hours per day. Patients with severe ARDS refractory to low tidal volume ventilation and other adjunctive therapies may be managed with veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) at an ECMO center.

Conclusions

An understanding of literature updates can improve the ED care of patients with ARDS.

### Effect of prone position in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome supported by venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a retrospective cohort study [^115DhVVx]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we explored the safety and efficacy of the application of PP in patients with ARDS supported with ECMO in a retrospective cohort. The main findings were of interest. First, PP in patients supported with VV-ECMO was safe. Second, the application of PP during VV-ECMO in patients with ARDS improved oxygenation without the enhancement of blood flow on ECMO or excess support of mechanical ventilation. However, there was no significant difference in hospital or ICU survival, or ECMO weaning rate.

We did not observe any major safety concerns such as severe bleeding from cannula insertion sites, dislodgment or extreme hemodynamic instability. However, owing to the design of retrospective analysis, some complications may be missed, but the major complications must have been documented in our study. All in all, in our study, there were no major complications in majority of the patients supported with ECMO. Therefore, with closely monitoring of the running status of VV-ECMO by experienced clinicians, PP during VV-ECMO is safe.

According to previous studies, there are consistent results indicating that PP during VV-ECMO in patients with ARDS improves oxygenation, although the time of assessment is not uniform. There are several potential explanations for the improvement of oxygenation of PP in patients with ARDS supported by VV-ECMO. First, the increased recruitment of alveolar in the dorsal lung results in better redistribution of ventilation in the dorsal regions where perfusion is maintained. The better matching of the ventilation-perfusion ratio accounts for the improved oxygenation. Second, PP reduces stress and strain across the lungs, resulting in reduced risk of VILI. Recently, Franchineau et al. used electric impedance tomography (EIT) to describe the impact of PP in patients receiving VV-ECMO and noted that the redistribution of tidal volumes and the end-expiratory lung impedance from the ventral to the dorsal regions with improvement were seen in static lung, which supports physiological benefits of PP in patients supported with ECMO, by modifying lung mechanics and potentially reducing risk of VILI. In addition, PP can promote drainage of bronchial secretion and reduce right cardiac afterload. However, oxygenation is affected by pump flow, recirculation of ECMO, heart minute output, and other comprehensive factors. Therefore, the results from our study are not able to confirm or negate other studies, owing to the limited number pf patients.

### Assessment of therapeutic interventions and lung protective ventilation in patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^115aSmAH]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

What is the relative association of management strategies for adult patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome with mortality and barotrauma?

Findings

In this systematic review and network meta-analysis of 25 randomized clinical trials including 7743 patients, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and prone positioning were associated with significantly lower 28-day mortality compared with lung protective ventilation alone. Moreover, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was the highest-ranked intervention associated with a reduction in 28-day mortality among the 9 interventions evaluated.

Meaning

These findings support the use of prone positioning in patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^112qzKuo]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) in sepsis-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is used in patients with severe acute respiratory failure to facilitate gas exchange in the setting of refractory hypoxemia or hypercapnic respiratory acidosis and may be used to facilitate a reduction in the intensity of mechanical ventilation; evidence is limited with two RCTs completed in the last 10 years and was downgraded to very low quality due to indirectness. The trials' inclusion criteria were strict and focused on a very sick population of patients with severe ARDS refractory to conventional ventilation strategies and other rescue therapies such as prone position, and one recent systematic review found that VV-ECMO delivered at expert centers reduced mortality for patients with severe ARDS. In clinical practice, patient selection is important and usually discussed prior to initiation of ECMO at an ECMO center, and cost and equity are substantial issues with a need for registry data to document longer term outcomes in these patients outside of the clinical trial context.

### Prone positioning during veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112cvMLH]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Our study has several limitations. First, although we put a great effort into obtaining as many data as possible from the authors of potentially eligible studies, we did not perform an individual patient data meta-analysis. Therefore, we cannot exclude that, following the inclusion of 20 observational studies out of 22 studies overall (91%), some imbalances may exist between the baseline characteristics of patients who were proned and those who were not. For example, clinicians may be more inclined to offer prone positioning to sicker patients. Unfortunately, since none of the RCTs randomizing patients to the prone positioning vs. no prone positioning intervention reported on 28-mortality, we could not perform any sensitivity or subgroup analysis separating RCTs from non-RCTs. However, for those seven observational studies applying a propensity score matching analysis, we pooled data referring to matched patients' cohorts. This may have limited the consequence of this selection bias. In addition, the use of prone positioning in sicker patients may favor the control group. Second, overall CoE was low or very low, mainly related to the risk of bias, inconsistency, and concern for publication biases for some of the outcomes. Several potential reasons for the high statistical and clinical heterogeneity should be mentioned, such as different studies' design, patients' baseline characteristics, mechanical ventilation and ECMO settings, pharmacological therapies, etc. Notwithstanding, we performed several subgroup analyses and meta-regressions, partially explaining the reported heterogeneity for the primary outcome. Moreover, the included studies were published over a 6-year period, which likely limited clinical heterogeneity among studies.

In conclusion, in this systematic review and meta-analysis, patients supported with V-V ECMO for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure who received prone positioning, compared to those who did not, showed improved 28-day and hospital mortality rates, despite fewer 28-day ventilator-free days and longer ECMO duration.

### Prone positioning under VV-ECMO in SARS-CoV-2-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome [^1159qdEj]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Infection due to severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) may lead to an atypical acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), requiring in the most severe cases veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO). The management of persistent severe hypoxemia under VV-ECMO requires a multi-step clinical approach including prone positioning (PP), which could improve oxygenation.

### Positive end-expiratory pressure management in patients with severe ARDS: implications of prone positioning and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [^1133woeT]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

The optimal strategy for positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) titration in the management of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) patients remains unclear. Current guidelines emphasize the importance of a careful risk–benefit assessment for PEEP titration in terms of cardiopulmonary function in these patients. Over the last few decades, the primary goal of PEEP usage has shifted from merely improving oxygenation to emphasizing lung protection, with a growing focus on the individual pattern of lung injury, lung and chest wall mechanics, and the hemodynamic consequences of PEEP. In moderate-to-severe ARDS patients, prone positioning (PP) is recommended as part of a lung protective ventilation strategy to reduce mortality. However, the physiologic changes in respiratory mechanics and hemodynamics during PP may require careful re-assessment of the ventilation strategy, including PEEP. For the most severe ARDS patients with refractory gas exchange impairment, where lung protective ventilation is not possible, veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO) facilitates gas exchange and allows for a "lung rest" strategy using "ultraprotective" ventilation. Consequently, the importance of lung recruitment to improve oxygenation and homogenize ventilation with adequate PEEP may differ in severe ARDS patients treated with V-V ECMO compared to those managed conservatively. This review discusses PEEP management in severe ARDS patients and the implications of management with PP or V-V ECMO with respect to respiratory mechanics and hemodynamic function.

### Physiological response to prone positioning in intubated adults with COVID-19 acute respiratory distress syndrome: a retrospective study [^115g3kXy]. Respiratory Research (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Coronavirus Disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is still causing thousands of deaths worldwide. Between 5 and 34% of hospitalized patients develop severe disease and are admitted in the intensive care unit (ICU). Most of these patients fulfill the criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), with a high mortality rate. Prone positioning demonstrated physiological and survival benefits in moderate to severe ARDS non related to COVID-19 and is recommended by the current international guidelines as part of ARDS management. The prone position improves oxygenation by promoting dorsal recruitment, allowing for a more homogeneous ventilation distribution, and improving ventilation/perfusion matching. It may also reduce lung stress and strain with a potential for reducing Ventilation Induced Lung Injury (VILI). It is still debated if COVID-19 related ARDS represents a distinct entity and whether common treatments used in ARDS are equally effective. International guidelines and experts, however, recommend the use of prone position in patients with COVID-19 related moderate to severe ARDS and this technique is more widely used than in the past. Some reports suggest a benefit of proning in COVID-19 patients, but few data are available on the physiological effects of proning in COVID-19 ARDS, except for the effect on the PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio. Factors associated with success and failure have also not been extensively described.

The main aim of this study was to assess the effects of proning in COVID-19 ARDS patients on oxygenation parameters (PaO₂/FiO₂ and alveolar-arterial gradient — Aa-gradient —) both for all the proning sessions considered together and for the first five proning sessions. As a secondary aim, we assessed the effects of proning (all sessions and first to fifth sessions) on other physiological and respiratory parameters such as respiratory mechanics, and dead space fraction estimates. Finally, as an ancillary aim, we looked for factors associated with treatment failure defined as ICU death or the need for veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO).

As an exploratory endpoint, we assessed the association between the use of PP during ECMO and hospital mortality in pre-defined clinically relevant subgroups (Fig. 2). The strongest association between PP during ECMO and decrease of hospital mortality was found in patients ≤ 50 years of age, BMI ≤ 30 kg/m², SOFA > 12, PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio ≤ 60 mmHg, in patients who were not proned PP before ECMO and in those with a duration of mechanical ventilation before ECMO ≤ 7 days.

Conclusion

Prone positioning under VV-ECMO improves oxygenation in SARS-CoV-2-induced ARDS without compromising the safety of the patients. The high mortality rate in prone ECMO patients may be explained by the greater illness severity and the lack of an immunomodulatory therapy such as corticosteroids.

### Prone positioning during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute respiratory distress syndrome: a pooled individual patient data analysis [^112pXXqy]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

In an exploratory analysis, we found a stronger association between PP and lower hospital mortality in patients who were younger (≤ 50 years of age), more severe (SOFA > 12, PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio ≤ 60 mmHg), in patients who were not proned PP before ECMO and in those with a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation before ECMO (less than ≤ 7 days). This might indicate a greater benefit of PP in the most acute and severe patients, who have higher mortality. In addition, BMI over 30 was not associated with beneficial effects of PP. We hypothesize that ECMO patients with BMI < 30 may have sicker lungs, and thus may benefit more from PP compared to obese patients, where severe hypoxia may be partly secondary to airway or lung collapse due to high pleural pressure. Therefore, the risk/benefit ratio of proning in this subgroup should be carefully evaluated.

Results

Baseline characteristics

38 patients (41.8%) received at least one period of PP during VV-ECMO, while 53 patients (58.2%) were maintained in supine position during VV-ECMO (Fig. 1). A total of 167 periods of PP were performed throughout the study. The mean duration of PP was 14 (12–16) h. The time from ECMO initiation to the first PP section was 2 (0.9–4.9) days. 4 (2.0–5.3) PP episodes were performed per patient (Additional file 1: Table S9, Fig. 2). The mean age of all patients was 49 (37–63) years old, male patients accounted for 70.3% (n = 64), and the mean Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score was 9 (6–12) points. PSM selected 25 pairs of patients with similar characteristics (Table 1).

### Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with COVID-19: an emulated target trial analysis [^115GYgT4]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used for patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) related to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). High-volume ECMO centers and large ECMO networks reported similar survival for these patients compared with patients who are ECMO-supported with non–COVID-19–related ARDS. Two randomized controlled trials, a post hoc Bayesian analysis, and a systematic review and individual meta-analysis all consistently supported the use of venovenous ECMO in adults with severe ARDS treated in expert centers. Whether patients with COVID may benefit from ECMO compared with mechanical ventilation associated with other adjunct therapies such as prone positioning and neuromuscular blockades remains unknown, as no randomized controlled trial has been performed in that population. However, a recent multicenter cohort study of adults critically ill with COVID-19 in the United States found that patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure treated with ECMO in the first 7 days of ICU admission had a considerable reduction in mortality compared with those not treated with ECMO.

We aimed to use the COVID-ICU cohort database containing prospectively collected demographic and clinical characteristics, management, and outcomes of patients admitted to ICUs for severe COVID-19 in France, Belgium, and Switzerland, between February and May 2020 to further examine the impacts of ECMO on survival in patients with COVID-19–related severe ARDS. We used the target trial emulation framework and causal inference methodology to compare the treatment strategies of initiating ECMO versus not initiating among patients who have started invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) within the past 7 days.

### Impact of prone position in COVID-19 patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [^114dqCzR]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Prone positioning and venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) are both useful interventions in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Combining the two therapies is feasible and safe, but the effectiveness is not known. Our objective was to evaluate the potential survival benefit of prone positioning in venovenous ECMO patients cannulated for COVID-19-related ARDS.

Design

Retrospective analysis of a multicenter cohort.

Patients

Patients on venovenous ECMO who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or with a diagnosis on chest CT were eligible.

Interventions

None.

Measurements and Main Results

All patients on venovenous ECMO for respiratory failure in whom prone position status while on ECMO and in-hospital mortality were known were included. Of 647 patients in 41 centers, 517 were included. Median age was 55 (47–61), 78% were male and 95% were proned before cannulation. After cannulation, 364 patients (70%) were proned and 153 (30%) remained in the supine position for the whole ECMO run. There were 194 (53%) and 92 (60%) deaths in the prone and the supine groups, respectively. Prone position on ECMO was independently associated with lower in-hospital mortality (odds ratio = 0.49 [0.29–0.84]; p = 0.010). In 153 propensity score-matched pairs, mortality rate was 49.7% in the prone position group versus 60.1% in the supine position group (p = 0.085). Considering only patients alive at decannulation, propensity-matched proned patients had a significantly lower mortality rate (22.4% vs 37.8%; p = 0.029) than nonproned patients.

Conclusions

Prone position may be beneficial in patients supported by venovenous ECMO for COVID-19-related ARDS but more data are needed to draw definitive conclusions.

Conclusion

Use of the prone position has been shown to improve the survival of patients with moderate-to-severe ARDS. The results of observational studies have demonstrated that the prone position in ARDS patients treated with ECMO can be safely performed and has many physiological benefits that may potentially lead to a decrease in mortality. However, several questions remain unanswered and large RCTs that address the effectiveness of proning ECMO patients are still needed.

### Assessment of therapeutic interventions and lung protective ventilation in patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1151bYVd]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

By including the ART, EPVent2, EOLIA, and ROSE trialsin our network meta-analysis, our findings could inform future updates of the clinical practice guidelines and decision-making process at the bedside. Given the limited clinical interpretation of SUCRA (relative efficacy assessment on eligible interventions), our findings demonstrate that prone positioning and VV ECMO should be considered early, with implementation of these interventions influenced by individual patient characteristics or available clinical resources. Our preplanned metaregression confirmed that ARDS severity (ie, aggregated PaO₂/FiO₂ ratio at study level) did not affect the findings of these analyses. However, VV ECMO should be restricted to severe ARDS, since the 2 included RCTs of VV ECMO only recruited patients with severe ARDS. Moreover, in addition to the statistical heterogeneity in severity among eligible studies, considerations such as the invasiveness, availability of resources, and need for clinical experience may also limit the use of VV ECMO to the patients with the most severe ARDS in high-volume centers. Therefore, prone positioning should be considered as a first-line approach for patients with moderate to severe ARDS in addition to LPV. Timely transfer to an ECMO-capable center and VV ECMO should be considered for patients with severe ARDS who have contraindications or who fail prone positioning, similar to the EOLIA trial. The strategy of HFOV combined with prone positioning was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in mortality but with a high SUCRA; however, inferences about its clinical efficacy and relevance remain uncertain owing to limitations from a single study with very small sample size. The lower rankings of the other 5 interventions (NMBA, HFOV, INO, INO with RM, and open lung strategy using RM and/or higher PEEP) suggests against their routine use.

### Veno-venous ECMO indications: more than respiratory support [^116HzKgH]. Critical Care (2019). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor.

Recently, we have read with tremendous interest the article published by Prof. Gattinoni et al. which is focused on certain aspects that are under-evaluated in extracorporeal gas exchange therapy.

Obviously, veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) indications are related to respiratory syndromes, and traditionally, its indication criteria were limited to gas exchange and respiratory mechanics. However, we consider that VV ECMO indications should not be limited to these. Cardiopulmonary interactions during severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), perhaps, plays a paramount role in the pathophysiologic derangements which leads to organic failure with its obvious consequences, from the increase in right ventricle (RV) afterload secondary to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction to the increase in intrathoracic pressure (ITP) (related to the syndrome and induced by mechanical ventilation) which affects pressure gradients for both, systemic venous return to the RV and systemic outflow from the left ventricle (LV). It has been found that cardiovascular abnormalities are more implied in the presumed cause of death in the PROSEVA trial, where only 15% of the patients had hypoxemia as a presumed cause of death, in counterpart to 21% and 49% related to refractory shock and multiple organ dysfunction. As in the post hoc analysis of mortality at day 28, the supine group in the quartile with PaO₂/FiO₂ between 124 and 150 had a mortality rate of 35%. Moreover, this favorable cardiovascular effect could explain the clinical benefits of prone positioning in terms of mortality reduction, thanks to the decrease in afterload and unloading of the RV.

We do not deny the clinical importance of hypoxemia in the pathophysiological context of ARDS as a VV ECMO indication, but certainly a more realistic approach should look beyond the classical criteria to start ECMO therapy and take into account the heart-lung interactions its effects and implications in the prognosis of patients with acute respiratory failure. Also, we understand that more data and scientific evidence is needed to support such clinical approach, but perhaps it is time to start raising it and consider it as a potential indication in future clinical studies.

### ECMO and prone position in patients with severe ARDS… [^114ZMLfR]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Zijlstra GJ, de Grooth H. ECMO and Prone Position in Patients With Severe ARDS. JAMA. 2024; 331: 1232–1233. doi: 10.1001/jama.2024.1873 To the Editor The PRONECMO study on the effects of prone positioning during ECMO1 concluded that prone positioning did not significantly reduce the time to successful weaning of ECMO. However, we find the presentation of this conclusion unclear. The stated primary outcome was "time to successful ECMO weaning, " but this primary outcome is reported as the proportion of successfully weaned patients at a single late time point: day 60. If we study the cumulative incidence curves for successful weaning, there is some early separation as more patients randomized to the prone position were successfully weaned by day 20, but the curves rejoin around day 30 and overlap at day
60. It is not immediately apparent how this result leads to the conclusion that there is no reduction in time to successful weaning.

Finding the appropriate confidence interval for the primary outcome of "time to successful ECMO weaning" is no easy feat, as readers are confronted with proportions, subdistribution hazards, cause-specific hazards, and cumulative incidences but no statistic that is directly interpretable as time. We would be grateful if the authors could provide the distribution of actual time to successful weaning in the patients successfully weaned from ECMO, given the stated aim to determine the effect of early prone positioning during venovenous ECMO vs supine positioning on time to successful ECMO weaning in patients with severe ARDS. Reviewing these data would also provide a clearer understanding of the conclusion. Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below.

### An update on management of adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^1133Sizs]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2024). High credibility.

American Thoracic Society acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) guideline — conclusions provide conditional recommendations supporting the use of corticosteroids in ARDS, VV-ECMO in selected patients with severe ARDS, neuromuscular blockers in early severe ARDS, and higher PEEP without LRMs in moderate to severe ARDS. With regard to differences from ESICM guidance, the document states "we suggest the use of higher PEEP in select patients" and clarifies that the recommendation is narrower "with regard to the patient population (moderate to severe ARDS only) and intervention (higher PEEP without accompanying recruitment maneuvers)"; for neuromuscular blocking agents, it notes "we suggest its use in early severe ARDS". For performance measurement, the committee determined that none of the new recommendations are suitable; measures retained from 2017 specify ventilation strategies limiting tidal volume to 4–8 mL/kg predicted body weight with inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure < 30 cm H₂O) in ARDS, and prone positioning for > 12 hours per day in severe ARDS.

### Assessment of therapeutic interventions and lung protective ventilation in patients with moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome: a systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113YgsxE]. JAMA Network Open (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

Our systematic review and network meta-analysis of 25 RCTs, which included 7753 patients and 9 interventions, found that prone positioning was associated with significantly lower 28-day mortality in patients with moderate ARDS compared with LPV alone. In patients with severe ARDS, VV ECMO was associated with significantly lower 28-day mortality. Furthermore, these interventions were highly ranked, with VV ECMO being the highest, although there were no significant differences in ranking probabilities between these interventions. No intervention was superior to any other in reducing barotrauma.

While the use of LPV remains the mainstay of supportive care in patients with ARDS, LPV alone may be insufficient to maintain adequate gas exchange or prevent ventilator-induced lung injury, and adjunctive interventions may be required. While many of these adjunctive interventions have been evaluated in RCTs or meta-analyses, to our knowledge, there are limited data comparing their relative efficacy with each other. Wang et alassessed 26 ventilatory strategies in their network meta-analysis for ARDS but divided the interventions into complex groupings, making clinical interpretation difficult. Moreover, they made comparisons with a strategy of higher tidal volumes that has little clinical relevance in the current management of patients with ARDS. In contrast, we decided to focus on a limited number of interventions that are commonly used in patients with moderate to severe ARDSrather than include all possibilities to provide the most relevant guidance for clinicians at the bedside.

### Beneficial effect of prone positioning during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for coronavirus disease 2019 [^117JWLvm]. Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The study investigated the impact of prone positioning during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support for coronavirus disease 2019 acute respiratory failure on the patient outcome.

Design

An observational study of venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients. We used a multistate survival model to compare the outcomes of patients treated with or without prone positioning during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, which incorporates the dynamic nature of prone positioning and adjusts for potential confounders.

Setting

Seventy-two international institutions participating in the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Critical Care Consortium international registry.

Patients

Coronavirus disease 2019 patients who were supported by venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during the study period.

Intervention

None.

Measurements and Main Results

There were 232 coronavirus disease 2019 patients at 72 participating institutions who were supported with venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation during the study period from February 16, 2020, to October 31, 2020. Proning was used in 176 patients (76%) before initiation of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and in 67 patients (29%) during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Survival to hospital discharge was 33% in the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation prone group versus 22% in the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation supine group. Prone positioning during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support was associated with reduced mortality (hazard ratio, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.14–0.68).

Conclusions

Our study highlights that prone positioning during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support for refractory coronavirus disease 2019-related acute respiratory distress syndrome is associated with reduced mortality. Given the observational nature of the study, a randomized controlled trial of prone positioning on venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is needed to confirm these findings.

### Prone positioning during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for acute respiratory distress syndrome: a pooled individual patient data analysis [^112hUivz]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Recently, the findings of the available studies on the use of PP during ECMO were pooled in in a systematic review and meta-analysis that showed a non-significant trend towards decreased mortality in patients who underwent PP during ECMO. However, this meta-analysis by Poon et al. (which also included 4 out of 5 studies included in our analysis) was performed on aggregate data (i.e. the authors did not have access to patient data), and may be biased by an imbalance between the characteristics of patients treated with PP and controls. Our analysis, on the contrary, was performed on individual patient data, thus allowing to adjust for confounders. Individual patient data analysis may allow to homogenize and to minimize bias, while increasing the sample size and, consequently, the statistical power. Due to the nature of the studies included in our analysis, our findings cannot support the routine use of PP. Nonetheless, the trend towards reduced mortality suggests that it is very unlikely that PP during V-V ECMO is associated with harm. Indeed, our study reports a low incidence of adverse events related to this procedure. However, it should be noted that PP during ECMO is a challenging procedure, and might be associated with more complications when performed in ECMO centers without a specific expertise. Moreover, PP is time-consuming and might be difficult to perform as requires four to six health care providers. This might be challenging especially in the COVID-era. For these reasons, we speculate that PP may be considered in experienced centers for the most severe ECMO patients, who present with a high degree of consolidation and lung collapse. Moreover, we might hypothesize that anticipating the commencement and increasing the number of PP procedures during ECMO (median of 2 (1–3) procedures in our study versus an average of 4 ± 4 in the PROSEVA trial) might provide a greater benefit on survival.

### Prone positioning during veno-venous or veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: feasibility and complications after cardiothoracic surgery [^112WEbwp]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

In patients receiving VV or VA-ECMO, PP improved oxygenation. Maintenance of the benefits after PP was most obvious in the VV-ECMO group. With VV-ECMO, the benefits of PP can be ascribed to well-documented mechanisms including a ventral-to-dorsal shift of tidal-volume distribution and a decrease in the atelectasis very often seen after protective ventilation. With VA-ECMO, PP may be less likely to improve oxygenation, as gas exchange reflects the combined effect of VA-ECMO and of the native-lung ventilation/perfusion ratio, which is influenced by hypoxic vasoconstriction, shunting, alveolar collapse, and the dead space. Hypoxaemia may worsen due to reduced pulmonary-artery flow during alveolar recruitment. We noted that the flow provided by the ECMO device remained constant during PP. As previously reported, cardiac output can increase, decrease or remain unchanged, depending on preload. Finally, the beneficial effect of PP on the lung parenchyma outweighs the systemic hemodynamic effect even when cardiac output decreases.

In our study, ECMO duration before PP was 7 days, compared to 2 days in another study. One quarter of our patients were successfully weaned off ECMO three days after the last PP session. Thus, PP may break the vicious circle of hypoxaemia, possibly allowing faster weaning off ECMO.

Another important result is the low frequency of complications, in keeping with earlier studies of VV-ECMO for ARDS.

The main limitations are the retrospective design and single-centre recruitment of patients who underwent highly specific procedures such as lung transplantation or pulmonary endarterectomy.

Given the low frequency of severe complications, PP in patients under prolonged VA- or VV-ECMO may deserve consideration as a means of improving hypoxaemia and, perhaps, expediting weaning off ECMO.

### Prone positioning during veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^116s6Xx8]. Intensive Care Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Different from the meta-analysis by Papazian et al. we did not observe significantly improved survival at 60 and 90 days with prone positioning. There are a few explanations for these findings. First, different from the previous study, 54% of the patients included in ours were affected by Covid-19-related ARDS, associated with more prolonged ECMO duration than non-Covid-19 ARDS. The higher rate of long-term complications associated with a longer ECMO course might attenuate the long-term beneficial effect of an early intervention, such as prone positioning. Noteworthy, more than 90% of the patients enrolled in the PRONECMO study, which did not observe prone positioning to be associated with significantly improved survival at 60 and 90 days as well, were affected by Covid-19-related ARDS. Second, our findings on 60- and 90-mortality may be related to the different studies included in our meta-analysis, compared to the previous. Many measures, e.g. mechanical ventilation settings, the timing and duration of prone positioning before and during ECMO, and weaning strategies, are widely variable among different studies, along with patients' baseline characteristics, thus potentially mediating the association of prone positioning with mid-term outcomes.

In our study, patients supported with V-V ECMO who received prone positioning had better short-term survival rates than those who did not. This observation reflects the data collected in this analysis and does not imply causation or a direct benefit of prone positioning. In our analysis, we observed lower 28-day mortality rates with the use of prone positioning in younger patients, those with higher SOFA scores, and non-Covid-19 cases. However, in patients who had already undergone prone positioning before cannulation, our data do not provide evidence that additional prone positioning during ECMO improves outcomes. Notwithstanding, since current literature is mostly based on non-RCTs, our results do not allow drawing definitive conclusion on the association between prone positioning and mortality. Also, further studies are needed to elucidate whether specific physiological characteristics, such as the potential for lung recruitment or overdistention, should guide the decision to proceed with prone positioning in individual patients.

### Prone positioning in acute respiratory distress syndrome during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [^115RXLZ2]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Dear Editor,

We read with respect the recent study by Dr. Poon, which investigated the potential benefit of prone positioning (PP) during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Total of 11 studies were included and the pooled result showed a non-significant increasing trend of survival rate in patients receiving PP during ECMO (RR 1.2, 95% CI 0.9–1.5). We would like to add some comments.

First, in the forest plot, we noted that the result from Garcia-2020's study was significantly different from others. We performed a sensitivity analysis by excluding Garcia-2020's study (Fig. 1), and the pooled result became statistically significant (RR 1.28, 95% CI 1.08–1.52). We believe several reasons may help to explain this finding. 1 > In Garcia-2020's study, the overall mortality rate was significantly higher than others (85% vs. 30–60%), which suggested potential heterogeneity within these ARDS cohorts. Therefore, whether PP during ECMO presented different efficacy in different ARDS phenotypes needs to be further investigated. 2 > PP during ECMO is still not routinely applied to patients during ECMO, due to risk of life-threatening complications, such as cannula dislodgement. In all these included studies, the indications for PP differed significantly. In Garcia-2020's study, PP was only used in case of severe hypoxemia or extensive lung consolidation, which generated an inter-relationship between PP and disease severity due to selection bias. However, in Giani-2020's and Schmidt's studies, PP is routinely performed or encouraged during ECMO. The indications in Chaplin-2020, Guervilly-2020, Yang-2021 and Rilinge-2020's studies were unclear. Therefore, we suggest that these conditions should be considered when interpreting the pooled result of the current study.

### Retrospective analysis of factors associated with outcome in veno-venous extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation [^1178d9Vy]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Veno-venous extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) is increasingly used as a therapeutic option in patients with respiratory failure refractory to conventional management, as attested by the latest ELSO registry reporting more than 30,000 VV-ECMO runs over the past 5 years. The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the most common indication for VV-ECMO, generally started on the basis of severe hypoxemia or respiratory acidosis unresponsive to optimization of mechanical ventilation and the use of rescue therapies (inhaled nitric oxide and prone positioning). Other less frequent indications for VV-ECMO are severe acute asthma, bridge to lung transplantation (LTx) and severe primary graft dysfunction (PGD) after LTx, as well as refractory bronchopleural fistula.

Several retrospective studies reported VV-ECMO mortality from 30 to 70% in ARDS (pre-COVID era) and from 5 to 10% in asthma. In addition, it was previously reported that about 60% of patients receiving ECMO for bridge to LTx could be successfully transplanted, with survival of about 90% in these patients. More recently, cohort studies in COVID-19 ARDS reported VV-ECMO mortality rates of ~ 40–60%. Two landmark clinical trials compared VV-ECMO to conventional treatment in ARDS, the CESAR and the EOLIA trials. Although these studies reported non-significant reduction of mortality with VV-ECMO (35% vs. 46%, p = 0.09, CESAR, 37% vs. 45%, p = 0.07, EOLIA), a post-hoc Bayesian analysis of the EOLIA trial suggested a potential survival benefit of VV-ECMO, and a recent individual patient data meta-analysis of these two RCTs indicated a significant decrease of 90-day mortality with VV-ECMO in ARDS. Also, in COVID-19, several emulated target trials using observational data revealed a better outcome with VV-ECMO than with conventional ventilation in patients with severe ARDS.

Second, a meta-analysis aims to pool studies with similar design, cohort, intervention, and outcomes. This also one reason for the debate that whether observational studies and randomized controlled studies should be included in one meta-analysis. In the current study, both the unadjusted findings from four studies and results after propensity score matching (PSM) from three studies were included in one forest plot. We suggest that the unadjusted findings and adjusted result (PSM or regression) should be separated.

### Prone positioning in patients with moderate and severe acute respiratory distress syndrome: a randomized controlled trial [^1111ZZ3S]. JAMA (2009). Excellent credibility.

Context

Post hoc analysis of a previous trial has suggested that prone positioning may improve survival in patients with severe hypoxemia and with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Objective

To assess possible outcome benefits of prone positioning in patients with moderate and severe hypoxemia who are affected by ARDS.

Design, Setting, and Patients

The Prone-Supine II Study, a multicenter, unblinded, randomized controlled trial conducted in 23 centers in Italy and 2 in Spain. Patients were 342 adults with ARDS receiving mechanical ventilation, enrolled from February 2004 through June 2008 and prospectively stratified into subgroups with moderate (n = 192) and severe (n = 150) hypoxemia.

Interventions

Patients were randomized to undergo supine (n = 174) or prone (20 hours per day; n = 168) positioning during ventilation.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was 28-day all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes were 6-month mortality and mortality at intensive care unit discharge, organ dysfunctions, and the complication rate related to prone positioning.

Results

Prone and supine patients from the entire study population had similar 28-day (31.0% vs 32.8%; relative risk [RR], 0.97; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84–1.13; P = 0.72) and 6-month (47.0% vs 52.3%; RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.73–1.11; P = 0.33) mortality rates, despite significantly higher complication rates in the prone group. Outcomes were also similar for patients with moderate hypoxemia in the prone and supine groups at 28 days (25.5% vs 22.5%; RR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.89–1.22; P = 0.62) and at 6 months (42.6% vs 43.9%; RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.76–1.25; P = 0.85). The 28-day mortality of patients with severe hypoxemia was 37.8% in the prone and 46.1% in the supine group (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.66–1.14; P = 0.31), while their 6-month mortality was 52.7% and 63.2%, respectively (RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.53–1.14; P = 0.19).

Conclusion

Data from this study indicate that prone positioning does not provide significant survival benefit in patients with ARDS or in subgroups of patients with moderate and severe hypoxemia.

### Positive end-expiratory pressure management in patients with severe ARDS: implications of prone positioning and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [^11134yVs]. Critical Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) has been a cornerstone in the management of mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) since its description by Ashbaugh et al. in 1967. As part of a lung protective ventilation strategy, PEEP improves ventilation distribution and potentially limits ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Although different methods to titrate PEEP based on oxygenation and respiratory mechanics have been evaluated in randomized clinical trials, the optimal strategy to improve clinical outcomes remains undefined.

The current European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) guideline on ARDS does not make a recommendation on higher versus lower oxygenation-based PEEP or PEEP titration guided by respiratory mechanics compared to oxygenation. In contrast, the American Thoracic Society (ATS) guideline on ARDS management suggests using higher rather than lower PEEP in patients with moderate to severe ARDS based on two meta-analyses showing an association between higher PEEP and improved survival in this ARDS subpopulation.

Management of severe ARDS patients with prone positioning (PP) and veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (V-V ECMO), along with the associated changes in respiratory mechanics and ventilatory strategies, may also affect the physiological effects of PEEP. In these situations, "optimal" PEEP may differ and warrant careful re-titration to balance potential benefits and harms.

This article reviews PEEP management in patients with severe ARDS, focusing on the physiological effects of personalized PEEP with respect to respiratory mechanics and cardiopulmonary function, and the implications of management with PP and V-V ECMO.

### Extracorporeal life support for adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome [^114WY1gK]. Intensive Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Extracorporeal life support (ECLS) can support gas exchange in patients with the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). During ECLS, venous blood is drained from a central vein via a cannula, pumped through a semipermeable membrane that permits diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide, and returned via a cannula to a central vein. Two related forms of ECLS are used. Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), which uses high blood flow rates to both oxygenate the blood and remove carbon dioxide, may be considered in patients with severe ARDS whose oxygenation or ventilation cannot be maintained adequately with best practice conventional mechanical ventilation and adjunctive therapies, including prone positioning. Extracorporeal carbon dioxide removal (ECCO₂R) uses lower blood flow rates through smaller cannulae and provides substantial CO₂ elimination (~20–70% of total CO₂ production), albeit with marginal improvement in oxygenation. The rationale for using ECCO₂R in ARDS is to facilitate lung-protective ventilation by allowing a reduction of tidal volume, respiratory rate, plateau pressure, driving pressure and mechanical power delivered by the mechanical ventilator. This narrative review summarizes physiological concepts related to ECLS, as well as the rationale and evidence supporting ECMO and ECCO₂R for the treatment of ARDS. It also reviews complications, limitations, and the ethical dilemmas that can arise in treating patients with ECLS. Finally, it discusses future key research questions and challenges for this technology.

### Ultra-lung-protective ventilation and biotrauma in severe ARDS patients on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a randomized controlled study [^114qTNje]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In this randomized single-blinded controlled study evaluating during 48 h two strategies of ventilation during vv-ECMO in severe ARDS patients, we did not observe a major impact on biotrauma of an ultra-lung-protective multimodal strategy associating very low tidal volume, low respiratory rate, positive expiratory transpulmonary pressure and intermittent prone position as compared with the lung-protective strategy of the early ECMO arm of the EOLIA trial. The pathophysiological rationale to use a ULP approach was attractive, but this large exploration of the biotrauma did not highlight any relevant beneficial effect of the investigated strategy.

We reported an unadjusted nonsignificant difference of 60-day and hospital mortality rates of 45% in the ultra-lung-protective group and 17% in the lung-protective group. However, both the study design and power did not allow any conclusion regarding the impact of the ULP strategy regarding clinical outcomes. Further studies should explore this aspect.

No large, prospective clinical trials comparing different ventilation strategies during vv-ECMO have been published. Therefore, no strong guidelines have been established. Available data, notably from the EOLIA trial, might offer insights into what might be considered current best practices.

Unresolved issues regarding the ventilator settings (notably PEEP and respiratory rate), role of adjunctive therapies (NMB, prone position), or facilitation of spontaneous breathing during ECMO are suggested as areas for future research.

Therefore, the present study can provide even very partial insights into the questions raised. How far can be decreased the intensity of mechanical ventilation during vv-ECMO and the potential risks of ultra-lung-protective invasive mechanical ventilation have been recently discussed.

We also provide some data on the feasibility and safety of multimodal ultra-lung-protective ventilation strategy which minimizes mechanical power transmitted to a level very close to quasi-apneic ventilation (< 3 J/min).

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Society of Intensive Care Medicine / Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice guideline: mechanical ventilation in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [^117Sz8oL]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

American Thoracic Society/European Society of Intensive Care Medicine/Society of Critical Care Medicine guideline — mechanical ventilation in adult acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) — states that the recommendation is strong for mechanical ventilation using lower tidal volumes (4–8 ml/kg predicted body weight) and lower inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure < 30 cm H₂O); for patients with severe ARDS, the recommendation is strong for prone positioning for more than 12 h/d; and for patients with moderate or severe ARDS, the recommendation is strong against routine use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and conditional for higher positive end-expiratory pressure and recruitment maneuvers. Additional evidence is necessary to make a definitive recommendation for or against the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with severe ARDS. Clinicians managing patients with ARDS should personalize decisions for their patients, particularly regarding the conditional recommendations in this guideline.

### To prone or not to prone ARDS patients on ECMO [^116NWb1s]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Research priorities

Several questions remain unanswered, so there is a lot of room for improvement in this field. The evidence is mainly based on physiological or observational studies that included a small number of patients and studies in ARDS patients not receiving ECMO. Large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are therefore needed to establish the role of the prone position in ARDS patients treated with ECMO. One of the most important unanswered questions is which ECMO patients would benefit from proning. It is also important to know about the relevance of timing of proning, as controversial results exist regarding the effectiveness of early and late proning. Finally, the duration of proning sessions is also important, as some data suggest that the benefits of the prone position may continuously increase beyond 16 h.

Currently, two large RCTs have been designed to analyze the effect of the prone position on ARDS patients treated with ECMO. The first study (Identifier NCT04139733) is designed to address the effect of early proning on the duration of ECMO. The second study (Identifier NCT04607551) aims to analyze the effects of proning on weaning from ECMO.

### Invasive mechanical ventilation in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome receiving extracorporeal support: a narrative review of strategies to mitigate lung injury [^111Hczay]. Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation is indicated in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and severely impaired gas exchange despite evidence-based lung protective ventilation, prone positioning and other parts of the standard algorithm for treating such patients. Extracorporeal support can facilitate ultra-lung-protective ventilation, meaning even lower volumes and pressures than standard lung-protective ventilation, by directly removing carbon dioxide in patients needing injurious ventilator settings to maintain sufficient gas exchange. Injurious ventilation results in ventilator-induced lung injury, which is one of the main determinants of mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome. Marked reductions in the intensity of ventilation to the lowest tolerable levels under extracorporeal support may be achieved and could thereby potentially mitigate ventilator-induced lung injury and theoretically patient self-inflicted lung injury in spontaneously breathing patients with high respiratory drive. However, the benefits of this strategy may be counterbalanced by the use of continuous deep sedation and even neuromuscular blocking drugs, which may impair physical rehabilitation and impact long-term outcomes. There are currently a lack of large-scale prospective data to inform optimal invasive ventilation practices and how to best apply a holistic approach to patients receiving veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, while minimising ventilator-induced and patient self-inflicted lung injury. We aimed to review the literature relating to invasive ventilation strategies in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome receiving extracorporeal support and discuss personalised ventilation approaches and the potential role of adjunctive therapies in facilitating lung protection.

### Early treatment of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome [^1136oW3Z]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2016). Low credibility.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is defined by acute diffuse inflammatory lung injury invoked by a variety of systemic or pulmonary insults. Despite medical progress in management, mortality remains 27% to 45%. Patients with ARDS should be managed with low tidal volume ventilation. Permissive hypercapnea is well tolerated. Conservative fluid strategy can reduce ventilator and hospital days in patients without shock. Prone positioning and neuromuscular blockers reduce mortality in some patients. Early management of ARDS is relevant to emergency medicine. Identifying ARDS patients who should be transferred to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation center is an important task for emergency providers.

### Ultra-lung-protective ventilation and biotrauma in severe ARDS patients on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a randomized controlled study [^114FD7PF]. Critical Care (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

A multimodal ultra-lung-protective strategy including intermittent prone position during 48 h in severe ARDS patients supported by vv-ECMO was not associated with a decrease in the pulmonary and the systemic biotrauma as compared with the lung-protective strategy of the EOLIA trial. Results of future or ongoing trials exploring clinical outcomes are expected.

### Prone positioning in severe acute respiratory distress syndrome [^111ob81x]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2013). Excellent credibility.

The study PROSEVA was published by Guerin C and colleagues in 2013 in the journal N Engl J Med. This study is related to the following diseases: Acute respiratory distress syndrome. In the PROSEVA study, the trial question was: what is the role of prone positioning in patients with severe ARDS? In the PROSEVA study, the study design was: multi-center, open label, RCT. In the PROSEVA study, the population was: 466 patients (148 female, 318 male). The inclusion criteria were patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for severe ARDS. The key exclusion criteria were contraindication for prone positioning, lung transplantation, underlying disease with a life expectancy of < 1 year, or end-of-life decision before inclusion. In the PROSEVA study, the interventions were: n = 237 performing prone-positioning sessions (within the first hour after randomization for at least 16 consecutive hours) n = 229 standard supine positioning (remained in semirecumbent position). In the PROSEVA study, the primary outcome was: significant decrease in death at 28 days (16% vs. 32.8%; HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.25 to 0.63). In the PROSEVA study, the secondary outcomes were: significant decrease in death at 90 days (23.6% vs. 41%; HR 0.44, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.67) Significant decrease in successful extubation at 90 day (80.5% vs. 65%; HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.7). In the PROSEVA study, the safety outcomes were: no significant differences in overall incidence of complications, with the exception of cardiac arrest, which was more common in the supine group. In the PROSEVA study, the conclusion was: in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation for severe ARDS, performing prone-positioning sessions were superior to standard supine positioning with respect to death at 28 days.

### Respiratory support in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: an expert opinion [^116R2Kdd]. Critical Care (2017). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Several decades of intensive research, collecting a huge amount of animal and human data, have helped modify the clinical management of patients with ARDS with a probable decrease in the overall mortality. The main goal of management should be to reduce as much as possible any potentially harmful effects of mechanical ventilation while ensuring adequate gas exchange. Targets of oxygenation, PEEP levels and use of adjuvant therapies, such as prone positioning or neuromuscular blockers, should be individualized in each patient. Use of ECMO should be considered in selected patients with reversible disease.

Secondary outcomes

Compared to control, hospital mortality was significantly lower in the prone positioning group (17 studies; OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.54–0.83, p < 0.001; I² = 39%, p-value for heterogeneity = 0.053; low CoE). The TSA was not feasible because only one RCT reported on hospital mortality.

We observed no difference in ICU (10 studies; OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.49–1.21, p = 0.255; I² = 63%, p = 0.004; very low CoE), 60-day (13 studies; OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.52–1.20, p = 0.266, 95% prediction interval [PI] 0.20–3.13; I² = 66%, p < 0.001; very low CoE), 90-day (11 studies; OR 0.91, 95% CI 0.61–1.36, p = 0.653, 95% PI 0.26–3.18; I² = 65%, p = 0.002), and 6-month mortality (two studies; OR 1.36, 95% CI 0.71–2.60, p = 0.355; I² = 0%, p = 0.609) between the two groups. ECMO duration was longer for patients receiving prone positioning (12 studies; SMD 0.37, 95% CI 0.07–0.66, p = 0.016, 95% PI − 0.61–1.34; I² = 65%, p < 0.001; low CoE), who also demonstrated fewer 28-day ventilator-free days (seven studies; standardized mean difference (SMD) − 1.38, 95% CI − 2.56 to − 0.20, p = 0.022; I² = 76%, p < 0.001; very low CoE) and longer ICU (11 studies; MD 9.17, 95% CI 3.55–14.79, p = 0.001; I² = 43%, p = 0.101) and hospital (five studies; MD 7.00, 95% CI 1.75–12.24, p = 0.009; I² = 52%, p = 0.079; very low CoE) length of stay (Fig. 3, electronic supplementary material 8). Finally, no association was observed between the use of prone positioning and 60-day and 90-day ventilator-free days, the rate of re-cannulation and tracheostomy, and the rate of ECMO-related complications (electronic supplementary material 8).

### An official American Thoracic Society / European Society of Intensive Care Medicine / Society of Critical Care Medicine clinical practice guideline: mechanical ventilation in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome [^116p3RQh]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Background

This document provides evidence-based clinical practice guidelines on the use of mechanical ventilation in adult patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Methods

A multidisciplinary panel conducted systematic reviews and metaanalyses of the relevant research and applied Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology for clinical recommendations.

Results

For all patients with ARDS, the recommendation is strong for mechanical ventilation using lower tidal volumes (4–8 ml/kg predicted body weight) and lower inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure < 30 cm H₂O) (moderate confidence in effect estimates). For patients with severe ARDS, the recommendation is strong for prone positioning for more than 12 h/d (moderate confidence in effect estimates). For patients with moderate or severe ARDS, the recommendation is strong against routine use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation (high confidence in effect estimates) and conditional for higher positive end-expiratory pressure (moderate confidence in effect estimates) and recruitment maneuvers (low confidence in effect estimates). Additional evidence is necessary to make a definitive recommendation for or against the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in patients with severe ARDS.

Conclusions

The panel formulated and provided the rationale for recommendations on selected ventilatory interventions for adult patients with ARDS. Clinicians managing patients with ARDS should personalize decisions for their patients, particularly regarding the conditional recommendations in this guideline.

Metaregression and subgroup analysis

Subgroup analyses based on the inclusion of patients with COVID-19, ECMO to PP interval, total ECMO duration, type of PP regime and quality of studies by JBI scoring were conducted. These analyses were conducted to elicit possible sources of variability in the primary outcome between groups, such as differing ARDS phenotypes between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. There was significant difference in the cumulative survival of patients with longer ECMO duration (more than 14 days) than patients with shorter ECMO durations (Table 1).

ECMO duration was reported in 8 studies, and comparison with a control group was available in 6 studies. Patients undergoing PP (6 studies) had significantly longer ECMO duration, of an additional 9.6 days (Additional file 1: Fig. S2; 95% CI 5.5–13.7, p < 0.0001, very low certainty). Pooled ICU LOS (7 studies) was 42.5 days (95% CI 28.4–56.7, very low certainty). Comparing data from 3 studies reporting on ICU LOS, patients undergoing PP had significantly longer ICU stays by 14.5 days (Additional file 1: Fig. S3; 95% CI 3.4–25.7, p = 0.01) than control groups. There was no significant difference in survival to ECMO weaning between both groups of patients (3 studies; RR: 0.92, 95% CI 0.49–1.71, p = 0.78).

Extracorporeal respiratory support for respiratory failure

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation

Details about the technology, principles and practice of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can be found elsewhere. Venovenous (VV) ECMO is predominantly used as a rescue therapy for selected patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and refractory hypoxia. Patients with refractory hypoxia due to ARDS continue to have a high mortality, in the order of 70 to 90%. Whether VV ECMO further improves survival in this group of patients when compared with lung-protective ventilation (LPV) and adjuncts such as neuromuscular blockade and prone ventilation is yet to be established. Recent studies demonstrating harm or no benefit with the use of high-frequency oscillation in patients with moderate to severe ARDS exclude this technique as a routine rescue option for refractory hypoxia and may further expand the scope of VV ECMO. Despite unfavourable results in the early studies, the CESAR trial showed improved disability-free survival at 6 months in 90 patients who were randomised to receive ECMO (37% vs. 53% on LPV, P = 0.03). However, 22 of these patients did not receive ECMO and a majority of them improved with LPV. The study was criticised for lack of standardisation of LPV in the control group. This may not be seen as definitive evidence supporting the use of VV ECMO. However, the CESAR trial and the UK data from patients with H1N1-related ARDS do confirm that referral to an ECMO centre may lower hospital mortality compared with matched non-ECMO-referred patients.

Analysis of 2009 H1N1 pandemic data demonstrates that while VV ECMO may be in equipoise with LPV, it may play a vital role in younger patients with critical oxygenation who have fewer failed organ systems and fail LPV. Although VV ECMO is relatively easy to institute technically, the complexities relate more to the availability of the service, practicalities of transfer to an ECLS centre, timing and patient selection, care of the patient on ECMO and minimising complications. Patients often need to be retrieved whilst supported by ECMO, and data suggest that this can be undertaken safely in trained hands with an appropriate system. VV ECMO and the more portable proprietary extracorporeal respiratory support devices such as Cardiohelp™ (Maquet Cardiopulmonary AG, Hirrlingen, Germany) can be utilised for transport.

### Effect of prone position in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome supported by venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation: a retrospective cohort study [^114LuV88]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Our study did not show a significant difference in survival rate between the two groups, which was conflicting with previous studies and a meta-analysis of 13 studies. Several reasons may explain this. First, in our center, we usually prefer to perform PP in patients who are difficult to maintain oxygenation after ECMO or have potential difficulties in weaning ECMO, while patients who have significant improvements in oxygenation after ECMO are usually maintained in supine position until ECMO weaning. It may generate an inter-relationship between PP and disease severity due to selection bias. The SOFA or APACHE II may not reflect the severity of lung disease. Second, we consider that the less duration of PP in our study results in the conflicting outcome (14 h in our study versus > 16 h in the PROSEVA trial). In addition, Zaaqoq et al. demonstrated that the duration of PP, time of day of PP, and the day of initiation of PP had temporal dimensions, which were unlikely to be dealt with properly in retrospective studies, might also contributed to bias. Finally, our cohort was limited by a small sample size, even though prone positioning was used in younger patients with viral infections. Of note, patients in the prone group showed significantly prolonged duration of ECMO support and hospital stay. The first reason may be the survival advantage of PP, although the difference in survival rates is not statistically significant. Second, as mentioned above, patients in the prone group were more likely to have difficulties in maintenance of oxygenation after ECMO or potential difficulties in ECMO weaning. This phenomenon produces the immortal time bias. In short, patients need to be alive and event free to receive prone positioning, whereas others who died earlier on ECMO, or had ECMO stopped for futility did not receive prone positioning. Third, considering the higher treatment abandoning rate in the supine group, we deduced that patients in the supine group might have greater risk of organ failure or severity of illness, and thus shorten the duration of hospital stay. In addition, the need of more sedation and curarisation in prone group might increase the time of hospital stay.

### Prone positioning in severe ARDS requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [^1163pmmy]. Critical Care (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Prone positioning has shown to improve survival in non-ECMO ARDS patients. There is sparse data on PP in ARDS patients with VV ECMO support. We therefore retrospectively analysed a large cohort of ECMO patients suffering from severe ARDS treated with or without PP at our centre. Our results do not indicate an overall survival benefit for PP during ECMO support per se. However, timing of PP may be crucial when designing future studies.

In comparison to previous PP studies, technical execution of PP in this analysis showed favourable characteristics. Beginning of PP after ECMO initiation was earlier than in other studies (1.7 vs. 6 or 9 days, respectively). Moreover, the average duration of each performed PP was longer (19.5 h) and more PP manoeuvres were performed per patient (2.0) than described before. This is especially important, as the survival benefit for PP in ARDS without ECMO support shown by Guerin et al. was achieved with long PP periods (17 h). Patients treated with PP in our patient collective showed increased PEEP and plateau pressure levels but still remained in the recommended limits of the ELSO guideline. As intended by the treating medical team, driving pressure was kept below 15 cm H₂O, as high driving pressures are strongly associated with increased mortality. Furthermore, no differences in driving pressure were found between both groups.

Patients with PP during ECMO showed a reduced rate of spontaneous breathing compared to patients without PP, despite the fact that neuromuscular blocking agents were not used on a routine basis during PP periods. However, it seems reasonable that PP patients might have been on deeper sedation levels than patients in the supine group. In contrast to this, the ELSO guidelines recommend an early reduction of sedation levels and a switch to spontaneous breathing after 24 to 48 h after ECMO initiation. Furthermore, low proportions of spontaneous breathing episodes were associated with a higher mortality. However, this only allows hypothesis generating, since causality between a reduced rate of spontaneous breathing and increased mortality cannot be proven in this analysis and could also be an expression of higher disease severity. Nevertheless, the reduced rate of spontaneous breathing in patients with PP should be considered in the discussion of benefits and disadvantages of this additional treatment.

American Thoracic Society ARDS guideline — retained recommendations from the 2017 guideline include core ventilation targets and adjuncts: We recommend using mechanical ventilation strategies that limit tidal volume (4–8 mL/kg predicted body weight) and inspiratory pressures (plateau pressure < 30 cm H₂O) in patients with ARDS; we recommend prone positioning for > 12 hours per day in patients with severe ARDS; and we recommend against the routine use of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation in patients with moderate or severe ARDS.

### Prone-positioning for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation [^112xNcp9]. Critical Care Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To determine the characteristics and outcomes of patients prone-positioned during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and lung CT pattern associated with improved respiratory system static compliance after that intervention.

Design

Retrospective, single-center study over 8 years.

Settings

Twenty-six bed ICU in a tertiary center.

Measurements and Main Results

A propensity score-matched analysis compared patients with prone-positioning during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and those without. An increase of the static compliance greater than or equal to3mL/cm H₂O after 16 hours of prone-positioning defined prone-positioning responders. The primary outcome was the time to successful extracorporeal membrane oxygenation weaning within 90 days of postextracorporeal membrane oxygenation start, with death as a competing risk. Among 298 venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-treated adults with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, 64 were prone-positioning extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Although both propensity score-matched groups had similar extracorporeal membrane oxygenation durations, prone-positioning extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients' 90-day probability of being weaned-off extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and alive was higher (0.75 vs 0.54, p = 0.03; subdistribution hazard ratio [95% CI], 1.54 [1.05–2.58]) and 90-day mortality was lower (20% vs 42%, p < 0.01) than that for no prone-positioning extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-related complications were comparable for the two groups. Patients without improved static compliance had higher percentages of nonaerated or poorly aerated ventral and medial-ventral lung regions (p = 0.047).

Conclusions

Prone-positioning during venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was safe and effective and was associated with a higher probability of surviving and being weaned-off extracorporeal membrane oxygenation at 90 days. Patients with greater normally aerated lung tissue in the ventral and medial-ventral regions on quantitative lung CT-scan performed before prone-positioning are more likely to improve their static compliance after that procedure during extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
