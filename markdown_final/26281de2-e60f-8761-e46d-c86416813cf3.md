## Question

DKA and CKD potassium replacement

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about potassium replacement in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) for patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of potassium shifts in DKA and how CKD alters baseline potassium handling. Then, I should verify what high-credibility guidelines say for DKA potassium management and whether they account for CKD. Next, I will examine CKD-specific data on admission potassium, treatment-related hypokalemia, and complications. After that, I need to synthesize a practical, risk-stratified approach to potassium replacement in DKA with CKD, including monitoring cadence and thresholds. Finally, I should consider special scenarios like SGLT2 inhibitor–associated DKA and outline evidence gaps and a cautious, individualized plan with safety checks.

> Let me first confirm the core pathophysiology, because I need to ensure I'm anchoring decisions correctly. In DKA, insulin deficiency and acidosis shift potassium extracellularly, masking total body potassium depletion; once insulin and fluids are given, potassium moves intracellularly and serum potassium can fall precipitously, risking hypokalemia if not replaced proactively [^1c4044c1] [^d0cc2a7c]. Hold on, I should verify CKD-specific nuances: in CKD and especially ESRD, baseline potassium is often higher due to impaired excretion, yet insulin-driven intracellular shifts can still cause rapid declines during treatment, so the net effect is unpredictable without close monitoring [^2ee8a6fc] [^c7f4fa76].

> Next, I should review authoritative DKA guidelines for potassium replacement and check whether they incorporate CKD considerations. The ADA 2025 Standards recommend replacing potassium based on serum levels: if K+ is less than 3.5 mmol/L, give 10–20 mmol/hour until above 3.5; if 3.5–5.0 mmol/L, add 10–20 mmol/L to IV fluids to target 4–5 mmol/L; if greater than 5.0 mmol/L, start insulin without potassium and recheck every 2 hours, with the caveat to ensure adequate renal function and urine output before replacing potassium [^51833118] [^94a269bf]. Wait, let me verify monitoring cadence: the ADA consensus recommends measuring potassium 2 hours after starting insulin and then every 4 hours until DKA resolves, which is a critical safety checkpoint I should not miss [^480053bc].

> I will now examine CKD-specific data to see how much these general algorithms need modification. Patients with ESRD and DKA present with higher admission potassium (about 5.8 vs 4.6 mmol/L in those with preserved renal function) and have a substantial risk of treatment-related hypokalemia, with roughly 24–30% experiencing K+ less than 3.0 mmol/L during insulin therapy, despite starting higher [^c7f4fa76] [^2ee8a6fc]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: although baseline potassium is higher, the fall with insulin can be just as steep, so I should not assume potassium replacement is unnecessary in CKD; rather, I should anticipate it and monitor more frequently [^2ee8a6fc].

> Let me consider fluid strategy because it intersects with potassium management and complications. Standard aggressive isotonic fluids can precipitate volume overload in ESRD, which occurred in 28% in one cohort, so I should favor cautious, small boluses with frequent reassessment or even insulin without fluids if euvolemic or overloaded, while still ensuring safe potassium handling during insulin shifts [^c7f4fa76] [^98ad96ad]. I should double-check that this aligns with expert reviews: yes, modified fluid approaches in advanced CKD are recommended to mitigate iatrogenic pulmonary edema while maintaining metabolic correction priorities [^767de197].

> Now, I need to synthesize a practical, risk-stratified potassium approach for DKA with CKD. For K+ less than 3.5 mmol/L, I should replace at 10–20 mmol/hour until above 3.5, using central access if rapid replacement is needed, and I should not delay insulin unless there is life-threatening hypokalemia. For K+ 3.5–5.0 mmol/L, I should add 10–20 mmol/L to IV fluids to target 4–5 mmol/L, recognizing that in anuric patients I must balance replacement with the risk of hyperkalemia and rely on close labs rather than urine output. For K+ greater than 5.0 mmol/L, I should start insulin without potassium and recheck every 2 hours, anticipating a rapid fall and being ready to pivot to replacement as soon as K+ enters the 3.5–5.0 range [^51833118] [^94a269bf]. Wait, I initially thought to withhold potassium entirely in all CKD patients with K+ above 5.0, but I should correct that: if K+ falls quickly into the normal range with insulin, timely replacement is still indicated to prevent hypokalemia, so I need to monitor closely and act dynamically rather than using a fixed rule [^51833118].

> Next, I should review monitoring cadence and safety thresholds, and I need to ensure I'm precise. I should check potassium 2 hours after starting insulin and then every 4 hours until DKA resolves, and in CKD I will increase frequency to every 2 hours if K+ is outside 3.5–5.0 mmol/L or if the trajectory is changing rapidly. I should also obtain frequent ECGs if K+ is less than 3.0 or greater than 6.0 mmol/L to detect arrhythmia risk, and I should involve nephrology early for dialysis planning if hyperkalemia is severe or refractory [^480053bc] [^0b88828e]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with CKD hyperkalemia guidance: yes, KDIGO emphasizes context-specific repeat testing and ECG monitoring for severe hyperkalemia, which supports a cautious, lab-intensive approach here [^0b88828e].

> I will now examine special scenarios, particularly SGLT2 inhibitor–associated DKA, because potassium patterns may differ. SGLT2-associated DKA often presents with lower serum potassium and higher rates of hypokalemia during treatment due to osmotic diuresis and natriuresis with RAAS activation, so I should anticipate a steeper potassium fall and consider earlier, proactive replacement while still following level-based thresholds and frequent monitoring [^5267ddd6]. But wait, what if the patient is euglycemic? I should confirm that DKA is present with ketonemia and acidosis and proceed with standard insulin and electrolyte protocols, as euglycemic DKA still produces the same intracellular potassium shifts with insulin therapy [^1c4044c1].

> Let me reconsider the strength of evidence and acknowledge limitations so I don't overstate certainty. Much of the CKD-specific DKA potassium guidance is extrapolated from general DKA protocols and observational CKD cohorts, with no randomized trials specifically in ESRD; thus, individualized judgment and close collaboration with nephrology are essential, especially for anuric patients where potassium balance is uniquely precarious [^767de197] [^6b260430]. I should confirm that my plan remains consistent with consensus statements emphasizing protocolized care with electrolyte replacement and cautious fluid management in advanced renal failure, which it does [^46f608a0].

> Finally, I should double-check that my practical algorithm is coherent and actionable. Pre-insulin baseline: obtain K+, creatinine/eGFR, bicarbonate, and an ECG if K+ is abnormal. During insulin therapy: recheck K+ every 2 hours initially, then every 4 hours once stable, add 10–20 mmol/L potassium to fluids when K+ is 3.5–5.0 mmol/L, and be ready to replace more aggressively if K+ falls below 3.5 mmol/L. Post-resolution: continue frequent K+ checks for 24–48 hours given rebound phenomena and ongoing shifts, and coordinate with nephrology for dialysis timing if hyperkalemia emerges or if hypokalemia is refractory to replacement in anuric patients [^51833118] [^480053bc]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with both DKA and CKD best practices: yes, it integrates ADA DKA potassium thresholds, ADA monitoring cadence, and CKD-specific cautions about fluid and dynamic potassium swings, which is the most evidence-aligned approach available pending CKD-specific trials [^51833118] [^480053bc] [^767de197].

In DKA with CKD, **potassium replacement is guided by serum potassium and renal function** [^51833118]. Replace potassium when K+ is 3.5–5.0 mmol/L, withhold when K+ > 5.0 mmol/L, and give 10–20 mmol/L IV fluids to target 4–5 mmol/L [^51833118]. Monitor K+ every 2–4 hours initially, then every 4 hours once stable, and adjust replacement to avoid hypokalemia from insulin shifts and hyperkalemia from impaired excretion [^480053bc]. In anuric patients, use smaller, frequent doses and consider dialysis for hyperkalemia; in hypokalemia, replace cautiously with close monitoring [^98ad96ad] [^5a58f987].

---

## Pathophysiology of potassium disturbances in DKA with CKD

In DKA, **insulin deficiency and acidosis shift potassium extracellularly**, causing hyperkalemia despite total body depletion; insulin therapy then drives potassium intracellularly, risking hypokalemia [^1c4044c1]. CKD impairs potassium excretion, increasing hyperkalemia risk and complicating replacement decisions [^2ee8a6fc].

---

## Clinical evidence and guidelines for potassium replacement

Current guidelines provide a **framework for potassium replacement** in DKA, but CKD-specific guidance is limited [^51833118]:

| **Serum potassium level** | **Recommended potassium replacement** |
|-|-|
| < 3.5 mmol/L | - 10–20 mmol/L/h until K+ > 3.5 mmol/L <br/> - Central access may be needed for rapid replacement [^51833118] |
| 3.5–5.0 mmol/L | - 10–20 mmol/L in each liter of IV fluids <br/> - Target 4–5 mmol/L [^51833118] |
| > 5.0 mmol/L | - Start insulin <br/> - Do not administer potassium <br/> - Monitor K+ every 2 hours [^51833118] |

---

These recommendations emphasize **individualized assessment** and close monitoring, especially in CKD [^51833118].

---

## Risks and complications of potassium replacement in CKD

Potassium replacement in CKD carries **unique risks**:

- **Hyperkalemia**: Impaired excretion increases risk, especially with excessive replacement [^2ee8a6fc].
- **Hypokalemia**: Insulin-driven shifts can cause rapid drops, risking arrhythmias [^d0cc2a7c].
- **Volume overload**: Fluids with potassium can worsen overload in anuric patients [^fd0d34de].

---

## Monitoring and adjustment strategies

Given these risks, **careful monitoring and adjustment are essential**:

- **Frequent monitoring**: Check K+ every 2–4 hours initially, then every 4 hours once stable [^480053bc].
- **ECG monitoring**: Use in significant hyperkalemia or hypokalemia [^notfound].
- **Dialysis consideration**: Use for refractory hyperkalemia or when fluid overload limits replacement [^notfound].

---

## Clinical outcomes and complications

Studies in ESRD show higher admission potassium, longer length of stay, and more complications (e.g. volume overload, hypoglycemia) than in non-CKD patients, underscoring the need for **tailored therapy** and vigilant monitoring [^c7f4fa76] [^fd0d34de].

---

## Practical clinical recommendations

Based on current evidence and guidelines, the following **practical approach** is recommended:

- **Baseline assessment**: Obtain serum potassium, renal function, and volume status before replacement [^51833118].
- **Individualized replacement**: Use 10–20 mmol/L IV fluids to target 4–5 mmol/L, adjusting for renal function and volume status [^51833118].
- **Close monitoring**: Check K+ frequently and adjust replacement dynamically [^480053bc].
- **Dialysis coordination**: Plan for dialysis in anuric patients or when hyperkalemia limits replacement [^notfound].

---

Potassium replacement in DKA with CKD requires a **careful balance** between correcting hypokalemia from insulin shifts and avoiding hyperkalemia from impaired excretion. Use guideline-based thresholds, monitor closely, and individualize therapy to reduce complications.

Discussion

In this study, we analyzed the clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients hospitalized with DKA and ESRD on chronic maintenance hemodialysis. We report significant metabolic and clinical outcome differences in patients with DKA and ESRD compared with patients with preserved renal function. The ESRD group presented with twofold higher glucose levels and higher admission potassium concentration compared with those with preserved renal function. We also observed a twofold higher rate of hypoglycemia and a 10-fold higher rate of volume overload, compared with patients with preserved renal function. In addition, patients with ESRD had higher healthcare resource utilization, including longer LOS and hospitalization costs compared with patients with DKA and preserved renal function.

Diabetes is a leading cause of ESRD, with about half of patients requiring dialysis having a diagnosis of diabetes. There is limited high-quality evidence on the management and outcomes of DKA in patients with ESRD. The poor clinical outcome observed in these patients highlights the need for close metabolic monitoring and intensified treatment regimens to prevent the development of DKA, as well as the need for prospective studies to assess personalized management algorithms — including volume replacement and insulin therapy — to improve treatment-related complications and reduce healthcare costs in this high-risk population.

The mainstay of DKA management in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes includes the administration of intravenous fluids, insulin and electrolyte replacement therapy. For patients without cardiac or renal compromise, current guidelines recommend infusing isotonic saline at a rate of 15–20 mL/kg or 1–1.5 L during the first hour, with subsequent rate of 250–500 mL/hour. The higher rates of complications observed in our study suggest that treatment recommendations included in societies' guidelinesmay not be applicable to patients with ESRD. First, we observed higher rates of volume overload suggesting that current recommendations for intravenous fluids resuscitation in DKA guidelines result in higher rates of fluid overload in the dialysis population. The main mechanism for the profound fluid and electrolyte depletion in DKA is osmotic diuresis, which is not present in dialysis patients with ESRD, increasing the risk of volume overload and pulmonary edema. Tzamaloukas et al reported that the degree of hypertonicity and intracellular volume contraction is less profound in patients with ESRD compared with patients with normal renal function at similar hyperglycemia levels.

### Challenges in management of diabetic ketoacidosis in hemodialysis patients, case presentation and review of literature [^5c8701cb]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Chronic kidney disease is associated with accumulation of uremic toxins that increases insulin resistance which will lead to blunted ability to suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis and reduce peripheral utilization of insulin. CKD patients fail to increase insulin secretion in response to insulin resistance because of acidosis, 1,25 vitamin D deficiency, and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Hemodialysis causes further fluctuations in glycemic control due to alterations in insulin secretion, clearance and resistance. DKA is uncommon in hemodialysis patients because of the absence of glycosuria and osmotic diuresis which accounts for most of the fluid and electrolyte losses seen in DKA, anuric patients may be somewhat protected from dehydration and shock, although still subject to hyperkalemia and metabolic acidosis. However, substantial volume loss can still occur due to a prolonged decrease in oral intake or increased insensible water losses related to tachypnoea and fever. There is no current guidelines for the management of diabetic ketoacidosis in anuric hemodialysis patients considering their differences than general population. In this review article we reviewed the literature and came with specific recommendations for management of Ketoacidosis in patients with CKD treated by hemodialysis.

Recommendations for implementation: Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)

We recommend that people with type 1 DM should only have SGLT-2 inhibitors initiated under the strict direction of the diabetes team (see section 7 a of the supplementary appendix) (Grade 1C).
We recommend that people with type 2 DM at greater risk of DKA (defined in Table 5 a.1 of the supplementary appendix) should have SGLT-2 inhibitors initiated with caution after discussion with the diabetes team (Grade 1C).
We recommend SGLT-2 inhibitors are discontinued when an individual develops DKA (Grade 1A).
We suggest that after an episode of DKA and where a clear contributing factor has been identified, there should be discussion with the person and clinical team to establish whether the benefits of re- introducing an SGLT-2 inhibitor outweigh the risks (Grade 2D).
When initiating SGLT-2 inhibitors, we suggest that individuals should be advised on the signs and symptoms of DKA and be instructed to temporarily withhold SGLT-2 inhibitors and to seek immediate medical advice if symptoms develop (Grade 1C).
We recommend always offering advice on sick day guidance when initiating SGLT-2 inhibitors and reminding them of this at every medication review (Grade 1C).
We suggest that individuals taking SGLT-2 inhibitors should be advised against following a ketogenic diet (Grade 2C).
We suggest that for people who choose to intermittently fast (e.g. for Ramadan), and particularly for those who are elderly, on diuretics or have CKD, consider withholding SGLT-2 inhibitors for the duration of the fasting period and for those people with diabetes ketone testing should be undertaken if unwell (Grade 2D).

Rationale

The evidence from the studies reviewed indicates that diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a recognised complication in people treated with SGLT-2 inhibitors and that it is more commonly found in conjunction with dehydration or infection. DKA is also likely to occur more frequently in people who are insulin deficient which would include people with type 1 DM, people with type 2 DM with a relative insulin deficient phenotype, and situations where people on insulin have their insulin dose reduced substantially. These Recommendations will allow clinicians to use SGLT-2 inhibitors in those who are likely to benefit from this treatment and yet also minimise the risk of the complication of DKA.

### Re-visiting pH-adjusted potassium to avoid hypokalemic crisis during management of diabetic ketoacidosis: a conceptual framework [^e3016871]. Diabetes & Metabolic Syndrome (2021). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) treatment guidelines recommend to initiate potassium-replacement when serum potassium (S K) drops within normal range, and to withhold insulin if S K is below normal. Despite strict recommendations, hypokalemia is frequently observed in DKA.

Methods

Scientific literature was thoroughly searched to find 1) DKA treatment guidelines, 2) studies reporting hypokalemia in DKA, 3) and literature elaborating mechanisms involved in hypokalemia.

Results

Acidosis affects S K and its regulators including insulin, catecholamines and aldosterone. Current conceptual framework is an argument to gauge the degree of hypokalemia before it strikes DKA patients utilizing S K level after adjusting it with pH. Suggested approach will reduce hypokalemia risk and its associated complications. The nomogram calculates pH-adjusted potassium and expected potassium loss. It also ranks hypokalemia associated risk, and proposes the potassium-replacement rate over given time period. The differences between current DKA treatment guidelines and proposed strategy are also discussed. Moreover, reasons and risk of hyperkalemia due to early initiation of potassium replacement and remedial actions are debated.

Conclusion

In light of proposed strategy, utilizing the nomogram ensures reduced incidence of hypokalemia in DKA resulting in improved clinical and patient outcomes. Pharmacoeconomic benefits can also be expected when avoiding hypokalemia ensures early discharge.

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with end-stage renal disease hospitalized with diabetes ketoacidosis [^6b260430]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

In 2015, there were almost 700 000 patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the USA. Diabetes is a leading cause of chronic kidney disease and ESRD, with approximately 40%–50% of patients on dialysis having a diagnosis of diabetes. The adjusted survival after 3 and 5 years of hemodialysis initiation is 55% and 40%, with patients with diabetes having the worst adjusted survival rates.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)is a serious and life-threatening hyperglycemic emergency that occurs in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In a nationwide study in the USA, we recently reported that up to 7.5% of patients admitted with DKA had ESRD listed as a comorbidity. The diagnosis and management of DKA in patients with ESRD is challenging due to alterations in glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity and altered renal clearance of antidiabetic medications. Despite extensive data from landmark studies on the management of DKA in general populations, there is virtually no evidence to guide appropriate volume replacement, insulin and potassium therapy in patients with DKA and ESRD. We recently reported that ESRD in patients with DKA was associated with higher adjusted risk for all-cause readmissions, with most readmissions occurring within 2 weeks after discharge.

A major limitation of prior studies has been the use of International Classification of Diseases Ninth/Tenth Revision (ICD-9/10) codes to identify the diagnosis of DKA, without confirmation of the diagnosis based on admission biochemical/laboratory data. Accordingly, we performed a detailed analysis of clinical and laboratory characteristics to confirm the presence of DKA and clinical outcomes in patients with ESRD on hemodialysis admitted to our tertiary referral academic center. We hypothesized that patients with ESRD, presenting with DKA, will have increased morbidity and treatment-related complications compared with patients with DKA and preserved kidney function.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^a59bfc65]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Practice Point 4.3.3 — planned discontinuation around surgery and adverse effects — advises: Consider planned discontinuation of medications (such as metformin, ACEi, ARBs, and SGLT2i) in the 48–72 hours prior to elective surgery or during the acute management of adverse effects as a precautionary measure to prevent complications, and note that failure to restart after the event or procedure may lead to unintentional harm. The rationale is to prevent perioperative acute kidney injury (AKI) and other complications such as hypotension or metabolic acidosis or hyperkalemia; withholding renin–angiotensin system inhibitor (RASi) therapy is associated with lower risk of perioperative hypotension, while evidence that withholding RASi lowers perioperative AKI is less consistent. In surgical contexts, antihyperglycemic agents such as sulfonylureas, metformin, and sodium–glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) would be held, and case reports, case series, and a systematic review of 47 cases report diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) over 1–3 days before elective surgery. Temporary discontinuation to manage adverse events is indicated in most cases, guidelines recommend discontinuation of RASi and therapy reinitiation at low dosages when the event is resolved, but fear of recurrence often results in failure to resume; observational studies show withholding RASi after these adverse events is associated with lower recurrence of adverse events but higher risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and death.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^4592cc16]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 — Metabolic acidosis management in chronic kidney disease (CKD): In people with CKD, consider use of pharmacological treatment with or without dietary intervention to prevent development of acidosis with potential clinical implications (e.g., serum bicarbonate < 18 mmol/l in adults). Monitor treatment for metabolic acidosis to ensure it does not result in serum bicarbonate concentrations exceeding the upper limit of normal and does not adversely affect BP control, serum potassium, or fluid status.

### Pathophysiology… [^d0cc2a7c]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Although persons with DKA typically have a history of diabetes, 27 to 37 percent have newly diagnosed diabetes. DKA is resolved when the glucose level is less than 200 mg per dL, the pH is greater than 7. 3, and the bicarbonate level is 18 mEq per L or higher.
4. POTASSIUM Although potassium is profoundly depleted in persons with DKA, decreased insulin levels, acidosis, and volume depletion cause elevated extracellular concentrations. Potassium levels should be monitored every two to four hours in the early stages of DKA. Hydration alone will cause potassium to drop because of dilution. Improved renal perfusion will increase excretion. Insulin therapy and correction of acidosis will cause cellular uptake of potassium. If the potassium level is in the normal range, replacement can start at 10 to 15 mEq potassium per hour. During treatment of DKA, the goal is to maintain serum potassium levels between 4 and 5 mEq per L. If the potassium level is between 3. 3 and
5.

2 mEq per L and urine output is normal, replacement can start at 20 to 30 mEq potassium per hour. If the potassium level is lower than 3. 3 mEq per L, insulin should be held and replacement should be started at 20 to 30 mEq potassium per hour. If the potassium level is greater than 5. 2 mEq per L, insulin therapy without potassium replacement should be initiated, and serum potassium levels should be checked every two hours. When the potassium level is between 3. 3 and
5. 2 mEq per L, potassium replacement should be initiated. 4 Some guidelines recommend potassium replacement with potassium chloride, whereas others recommend combining it with potassium phosphate or potassium acetate. Clinical trials are lacking to determine which is best, although in the face of phosphate depletion, potassium phosphate is used. 4 Persons with anemia or respiratory problems and congestive heart failure may benefit from phosphate.

This can be achieved by adding 20 to 30 mEq of potassium phosphate to the intravenous fluid. 4 DKA can cause a drop in magnesium, which can result in paresthesia, tremor, muscle spasm, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmia. It should be replaced if it falls below 1. 2 mg per dL or if symptoms of hypomagnesemia develop. 35.

### Management of hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS) in adults: an updated guideline from the joint British diabetes societies (JBDS) for inpatient care group [^3432b59c]. Diabetic Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

4.5 Potassium replacement

Hypokalaemia in HHS is multifactorial. Osmotic diuresis and consequent hypertonicity from hyperglycaemia lead to fluids shifts from the intracellular space into the extracellular space. This leads to intracellular potassium loss. In addition, hypoperfusion leads to the activation of aldosterone secretion, further exacerbating the potassium loss. Vomiting, if present, worsens hypokalaemia. Lack of insulin in DKA, accumulation of ketone bodies leading to ketoacidosis and drop in bicarbonate ion concentration leads to a further loss of potassium from the intracellular to the extracellular space. In both cases (DKA and/or HHS) there is a total body loss of potassium. Treatment with insulin will lead to a shift of potassium back into the intracellular space which unravels hypokalaemia.

Those on diuretics may be profoundly hypokalaemic to start with. It is also worth noting that if acute kidney injury is present, hyperkalaemia may be present owing to reduced clearance and therefore closer monitoring is required.

Potassium level assessment and replacement is crucial in management of HHS and if mixed with ketosis/DKA. For guidance on potassium replacement see Table 2.

Table 12 — Mitigation strategies for side effects of newer agents to treat diabetic kidney disease — For SGLT2 inhibitors, strategies include hygiene and topical antifungals for genital mycotic infections; for volume depletion, proactive dose reduction of diuretics in persons at risk for hypovolemia, holding SGLT2is during GI illness, improving glucose control to reduce glucosuria, and educating persons with diabetes on early recognition; for ketoacidosis, the "STOP DKA" protocol details stopping SGLT2i, testing for ketones, maintaining fluid and carbohydrate intake, and using maintenance and supplemental insulin; for hypoglycemia, adjustment of background antihyperglycemic agents is advised. For GLP-1 receptor agonists, patient education on tolerability and symptom recognition, starting at lowest dose with slow titration, and adjustment of background antihyperglycemic agents are listed. For finerenone, hyperkalemia mitigation includes dietary restriction of potassium, thiazide or loop diuretics, SGLT2i, and potassium-binding agents (patiromer or sodium zirconium cyclosilicate).

### Potassium concentration in initial fluid therapy and in-hospital mortality of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis [^1c15ba2f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Guidelines worldwide recommend potassium replacement of 10 to 40 mmol/L in the initial fluid therapy for patients with diabetic ketoacidosis. However, evidence is lacking as to the association between infused potassium concentration and mortality.

Objective

We aimed to determine the association between infused potassium concentration and in-hospital mortality.

Methods

Using the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database, we retrospectively identified inpatients admitted for treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis from July 2010 to March 2018. Patients with kidney dysfunction or serum potassium abnormalities were excluded. We evaluated the association of the potassium concentration in the total infused solutions in the first 2 days of hospitalization with 28-day in-hospital mortality using multivariable regression analysis with a cubic spline model. We also assessed the association between potassium concentration and occurrence of hyperkalemia.

Results

We identified 14 216 patients with diabetic ketoacidosis and observed 261 deaths. The quartile cut-points for potassium concentration were 7.7, 11.4, and 16.1 mmol/L. Within the range of approximately 10 to 40 mmol/L, potassium concentration was not associated with occurrence of hyperkalemia or death. Lower potassium concentrations were associated with higher 28-day in-hospital mortality; the odds ratio for patients receiving 8 mmol/L was 1.69 (95% CI, 1.03 to 2.78; reference: 20 mmol/L), and the odds ratio increased monotonically as potassium concentration decreased further.

Conclusion

Patients receiving potassium replacement at concentrations of 10 to 40 mmol/L had similar in-hospital mortality rates, whereas lower concentrations were associated with higher mortality.

### The management of diabetic ketoacidosis in adults-an updated guideline from the joint British diabetes society for inpatient care [^38af5b2b]. Diabetic Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

This article summarises the Joint British Diabetes Societies for Inpatient Care guidelines on the management of ketoacidosis; available at https://abcd.care/resource/management-diabetic-ketoacidosis-dka-adults. The document explicitly states that when a person aged 16–18 is under the care of the paediatric team, then the paediatric guideline should be used, and if they are cared for by an adult team, then this guideline should be used. The guideline takes into account new evidence on the use of the previous version of this document, particularly the high prevalence of hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia, and recommends that when the glucose concentration drops below 14 mmol/L, that de-escalating the insulin infusion rate from 0.1 to 0.05 units/kg/h should be considered. Furthermore, a section has been added to address the recognition that use of sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors is associated with an increased risk of euglycaemic ketoacidosis. The management of ketoacidosis in people with end-stage renal failure or on dialysis is also mentioned. Finally, the algorithms to illustrate the guideline have been updated.

Hyperkalemia contributors and diet strategies in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — non-dietary factors and when diet restriction applies are outlined. Medications, metabolic acidosis, hyperosmosis due to hyperglycemia, hypernatremia or uremia, and constipation are more likely to explain plasma potassium abnormalities than diet. Although short-term dietary restriction of the foods highest in potassium is a valid strategy to treat acute hyperkalemia, restriction of foods highest in bioavailable potassium may be a supportive prevention strategy for people with a history of hyperkalemia or during periods in which hyperkalemia risk is a concern.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — absolute benefits, harms, and certainty of evidence are quantified from meta-analyses as follows: In CKD with type 2 diabetes (T2D), per 1000 people treated for 1 year with an SGLT2i there were 11 fewer cardiovascular deaths or hospitalizations for heart failure, 11 fewer developing kidney disease progression, and 4 fewer with acute kidney injury (AKI), alongside approximately 1 episode of ketoacidosis and approximately 1–lower-limb amputation. In CKD without diabetes, the corresponding benefits were 15 fewer with kidney disease progression, 5 fewer with AKI, and 2 fewer cardiovascular deaths or hospitalizations for heart failure per 1000 patient-years of treatment, with no excess risk of ketoacidosis or amputation observed. SGLT2i are well tolerated with high adherence; the vast majority of urinary tract infections are not caused by SGLT2 inhibition and there is no increased risk of hypoglycemia, although mycotic genital infections increase but are generally mild and manageable with low-cost topical agents. The evidence derives from large, double-blind trials with consistent effect sizes and no risk of publication bias via collaborative meta-analysis, providing high levels of certainty of efficacy and suggesting larger relative effects on kidney disease progression among people with higher levels of albuminuria.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis [^1c4044c1]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2020). High credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is the most common acute hyperglycaemic emergency in people with diabetes mellitus. A diagnosis of DKA is confirmed when all of the three criteria are present - 'D', either elevated blood glucose levels or a family history of diabetes mellitus; 'K', the presence of high urinary or blood ketoacids; and 'A', a high anion gap metabolic acidosis. Early diagnosis and management are paramount to improve patient outcomes. The mainstays of treatment include restoration of circulating volume, insulin therapy, electrolyte replacement and treatment of any underlying precipitating event. Without optimal treatment, DKA remains a condition with appreciable, although largely preventable, morbidity and mortality. In this Primer, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, risk factors and diagnosis of DKA and provide practical recommendations for the management of DKA in adults and children.

Diabetes and chronic kidney disease dietary protein — The NKF-KDOQI Guidelines on Hypertension and Antihypertensive Agents in CKD recommended a version of the DASH diet with modifications that decreased dietary protein from 1.4 g/kg body weight per day to 0.6 to 0.8 g/kg body weight per day and restricted phosphorus (0.8 to 1.0 g/d) and potassium (2 to 4 g/d). Based on early-stage considerations, the Work Group concluded that a protein intake that meets, but does not exceed, the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) would be prudent at CKD stages 1 to 2. The ADA endorses a dietary protein intake of 0.8 g/kg body weight per day for people with diabetic kidney disease (DKD), and an additional restriction to 0.6 g/kg body weight per day is suggested should glomerular filtration rate begin to decrease. The dietary protein recommendation should be based on idealized body weight to avoid overestimation in obesity.

### Diabetic ketoacidosis: evaluation and treatment… [^11a2e3d1]. AAFP (2013). Low credibility.

Although persons with DKA typically have a history of diabetes, 27 to 37 percent have newly diagnosed diabetes. DKA is resolved when the glucose level is less than 200 mg per dL, the pH is greater than 7. 3, and the bicarbonate level is 18 mEq per L or higher.
4. POTASSIUM Although potassium is profoundly depleted in persons with DKA, decreased insulin levels, acidosis, and volume depletion cause elevated extracellular concentrations. Potassium levels should be monitored every two to four hours in the early stages of DKA. Hydration alone will cause potassium to drop because of dilution. Improved renal perfusion will increase excretion. Insulin therapy and correction of acidosis will cause cellular uptake of potassium. If the potassium level is in the normal range, replacement can start at 10 to 15 mEq potassium per hour. During treatment of DKA, the goal is to maintain serum potassium levels between 4 and 5 mEq per L. If the potassium level is between 3. 3 and
5.

2 mEq per L and urine output is normal, replacement can start at 20 to 30 mEq potassium per hour. If the potassium level is lower than 3. 3 mEq per L, insulin should be held and replacement should be started at 20 to 30 mEq potassium per hour. If the potassium level is greater than 5. 2 mEq per L, insulin therapy without potassium replacement should be initiated, and serum potassium levels should be checked every two hours. When the potassium level is between 3. 3 and
5. 2 mEq per L, potassium replacement should be initiated. 4 Some guidelines recommend potassium replacement with potassium chloride, whereas others recommend combining it with potassium phosphate or potassium acetate. Clinical trials are lacking to determine which is best, although in the face of phosphate depletion, potassium phosphate is used. 4 Persons with anemia or respiratory problems and congestive heart failure may benefit from phosphate.

This can be achieved by adding 20 to 30 mEq of potassium phosphate to the intravenous fluid. 4 DKA can cause a drop in magnesium, which can result in paresthesia, tremor, muscle spasm, seizures, and cardiac arrhythmia. It should be replaced if it falls below 1. 2 mg per dL or if symptoms of hypomagnesemia develop. 35.

Healthcare systems should aim to provide safe and proven cost-effective therapies that achieve CKD treatment and risk modification and to minimize limitations to access for people with CKD, and a key goal for healthcare providers should be to identify people at risk and to start such treatments early in the course of CKD to maximize potential benefits. Operational aims include prevention and treatment of clinical symptoms and signs (including blood pressure), appropriate monitoring and treatment of laboratory abnormalities of CKD associated with implications for health (e.g., anemia, CKD-MBD, potassium disorders, acidosis), and to minimize risk of progression to kidney failure while managing risk and appropriate treatment of complications, including cardiovascular diseases, hospitalization, gout, infections, etc.

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with end-stage renal disease hospitalized with diabetes ketoacidosis [^98ad96ad]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

We suggest a modified approach for fluid replacement in patients with ESRD, preferring a small bolus of 250 mL initially with reassessment after each infusion — particularly if no hypotensive, or just insulin therapy without fluids bolus. Intensive fluid resuscitation during the initial management of DKA usually results in some degree of correction of hyperglycemia due to forced osmotic diuresis. However, hypertonicity in these patients is more a reflection of the degree of hyperglycemia and not due to osmotic diuresis, as previously discussed. It has been proposed that adequate insulin administration alone, with limited or without intravenous fluid resuscitation, may resolve the metabolic disturbances without complications. Current guidelines recommend an insulin infusion with a glucose correction rate of 50–75 mg/dL/hour. Using continuous glucose monitoring on patients with diabetes, Kazempour-Ardebili et al showed lower mean glucose levels by −36 to −190 mg/dL during dialysis days compared with days off dialysis; and Sobngwi et al showed that total daily insulin needs can decrease by ~25% on hemodialysis days. Hence, we suggest a careful and slower rate of hyperglycemia correction, considering the glucose-lowering effect of dialysis and/or potentially avoiding the use of intravenous insulin bolus on starting the insulin infusion, which may decrease the risk of hypoglycemia. However, future studies are needed to determine the best hydration regimen to manage patients with DKA and ESRD to minimize iatrogenic fluid overload.

SAFETY PROFILE OF SGLT2i

The renal safety profile of SGLT2i has been quantified by meta-analysis. Data from 13 studies of 90413 participants showed that beyond the known excess risk of mycotic genital infections (RR, 3.57; 95% CI, 3.14–4.06), there was no overall increased risk of other safety outcomes, including serious urinary tract infections, amputations, and fractures. In patients with diabetes, the risk of ketoacidosis is approximately doubled, but the risk is higher for states of insulin deficiency and T1 diabetes mellitus and patients with T2DM in the trials remained at low absolute risk. In the trial populations studies to date, the absolute harms of SGLT2i in patients with and without diabetes are clearly lower than the substantial absolute benefits. This is particularly the case in patients with CKD, and especially those without diabetes. Furthermore, meta-analysis of the large placebo-controlled SGLT2i trials show they reduce the risk of AKI (HR 0.77, 0.70–0.84) and reduce risk of serious adverse events of hyperkalaemia by 16% (0.84, 95% CI 0.76–0.93). Although there is a risk of ketoacidosis and hypoglycaemia with these agents, there were no differences in the incidence of these events between placebo and control groups.

Reductions in serious hyperkalaemia were consistent across the trials and a range of subgroups, including baseline kidney function, history of HF, and use of RASi, diuretic, and MRA. Of note, SGLT2i did not increase the risk of hypokalaemia [HR, 1.04 (95% CI, 0.94–1.15)]. In the HFrEF setting, beneficial effects of empagliflozin were unmodified in a secondary analysis of EMPEROR Reduced when those prescribed an MRA at baseline or not were compared, and allocation to empagliflozin was associated with less discontinuation of MRAs (perhaps due to less severe hyperkalaemia with empagliflozin). In DAPA-HF moderate/severe hyperkalaemia (potassium > 6.0 mmol/l) was less common among patients assigned to dapagliflozin, compared with placebo in patients taking an MRA at baseline [HR 0.50 (0.29–0.85); P = 0.01, P value for interaction 0.08].

### Management of diabetes-related hyperglycaemic emergencies in advanced chronic kidney disease: review of the literature and recommendations [^767de197]. Diabetic Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Aims

Despite the substantial progress in the management of diabetes mellitus (DM), chronic kidney disease (CKD) remains one of the most common complications. Although uncommon, diabetic emergencies [diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state (HHS)] can still occur in stage 4 and 5 CKD, at times with less typical clinical manifestations due to the altered pathophysiology, presence of chronic metabolic acidosis and effect of haemodialysis on glycaemic control and metabolic parameters. The purpose of this article is to review the current literature and provide recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of DKA, euglycaemic DKA and HHS in people with advanced CKD.

Methods and Results

Guidance on the management of diabetes-related emergencies mainly focuses on individuals with preserved renal function or early-stage CKD. Existing literature is limited, and recommendations are based on expert opinions and case reports. Given the clinical need for amended guidelines for this population, we are proposing a management algorithm for DKA and HHS based on clinical and metabolic parameters.

Conclusions

In this review article, we propose treatment algorithms for diabetes-related hyperglycaemic emergencies in people with advanced CKD. Further research is needed to validate our proposed algorithms.

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes of patients with end-stage renal disease hospitalized with diabetes ketoacidosis [^2ee8a6fc]. BMJ Open Diabetes Research & Care (2020). High credibility.

Potassium concentration is maintained in the body by balancing the intake with the excretion and the transcellular shifts of potassium. Approximately 75% of patients admitted with DKA present with elevated serum potassium levels on admission owing to the shift of intracellular potassium to the extracellular compartment in the setting of hypertonicity, insulin deficiency and acidosis. As expected, patients with ESRD in this study presented with higher potassium levels due to diminished potassium excretion by the kidneys. During insulin treatment, potassium concentration rapidly decreases due to intracellular shifting of potassium, mediated by insulin stimulation of Na + -H + transporter, promoting the entry of Na +, then activation of the Na + -K + ATPase, resulting in influx of potassium; as well as increased kaliuresis, thought to be mediated by an aldosterone-like effect of insulin. In recent studies in patients with ESRD, the prevalence of hyperkalemia ≥ 5 mmol/L was reported between 14% and 20%, and the prevalence of hypokalemia ≤ 4 mmol/L was between 12% and 18%, with both conditions associated with increased mortality. Patients with DKA and ESRD presented with higher potassium concentration compared with patients with preserved renal function. In agreement with previous reports, insulin administration was the only treatment required for correction of hyperkalemia. Of interest, we observed no differences in the rate of hypokalemia between groups. These results indicate the need for a modified potassium administration approach in the management of DKA in patients with ESRD, as well as close follow-up of potassium levels on admission and during insulin treatment.

We acknowledge several limitations in our analysis including a relatively small number of patients with ESRD presenting with DKA; however, this is the largest cohort study of patients with ESRD admitted with DKA — an uncommon scenario. The retrospective nature of the study and the use of ICD-9 codes may limit the ability to accurately differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes, duration of diabetes and precipitant causes. Nonetheless, despite using ICD-9/10 codes, we were able to confirm all cases of DKA and ESRD based on biochemical data on admission, which have been a limitation of previous reports. In addition, although a DKA treatment protocol is available for use in the emergency department and in intensive care unit and step-down units, the current protocols are not designed to adjust for changes in insulin, fluid and electrolyte administration in patients with diabetes and ESRD on hemodialysis. We also recognized the limited value of HbA1c in the setting of ESRD.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) — "We recommend treating patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), CKD, and an eGFR ≥ 20 ml/min per 1.73 m² with an SGLT2i (1A)". "Once an SGLT2i is initiated, it is reasonable to continue an SGLT2i even if the eGFR falls below 20 ml/min per 1.73 m², unless it is not tolerated or KRT is initiated". Additionally, "We recommend treating adults with CKD with an SGLT2i for the following (1A): eGFR ≥ 20 ml/min per 1.73 m² with urine ACR ≥ 200 mg/g (≥ 20 mg/mmol), or heart failure, irrespective of level of albuminuria". Per precautions, "It is reasonable to withhold SGLT2i during times of prolonged fasting, surgery, or critical medical illness (when people may be at greater risk for ketosis)". Monitoring guidance states, "SGLT2i initiation or use does not necessitate alteration of frequency of CKD monitoring and the reversible decrease in eGFR on initiation is generally not an indication to discontinue therapy".

### Diabetic ketoacidosis: evaluation and treatment [^34c57fa9]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is a life-threatening complication of type 1 and type 2 diabetes resulting from an absolute or relative insulin deficiency. It can occur in patients of all ages and can be the initial presentation of diabetes, especially in young children. Polyuria and polydipsia are the most common symptoms, followed by nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, weight loss, severe fatigue, dyspnea, and preceding febrile illness. Traditionally, DKA has been diagnosed by the triad of hyperglycemia (blood glucose greater than 250 mg/dL), metabolic acidosis (pH less than 7.3, serum bicarbonate less than 18 mEq/L, anion gap greater than 10 mEq/L), and elevated serum (preferred) or urine ketones. However, hyperglycemia has been de-emphasized in recent guidelines because of the increasing incidence of euglycemic DKA. The use of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors modestly increases the risk of DKA and euglycemic DKA. Electrolytes, phosphate, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, urinalysis, complete blood cell count with differential, A1C, and electrocardiography should be evaluated for all patients diagnosed with DKA to identify causes and complications of DKA. Amylase, lipase, hepatic transaminase levels, troponin, creatine kinase, blood and urine cultures, and chest radiography are additional tests to consider. Treatment involves fluid and electrolyte replacement, insulin, treatment of precipitating causes, and close monitoring to adjust therapy and identify complications. Prevention strategies include identifying diabetes before DKA develops, educating patients to manage high-risk situations, and ensuring uninterrupted access to therapies for diabetes.

### What are we waiting for? A review of early basal insulin therapy in diabetic ketoacidosis management [^ead6658b]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) remains a significant challenge for healthcare systems due to prolonged lengths of stay and rising costs. The current American Diabetes Association (ADA) guidelines recommend starting basal insulin after resolution of DKA. However, these guidelines have not been updated since 2009, which can potentially limit optimal care. Meanwhile, the Joint British Society guidelines on DKA management, which were more recently updated in March 2023, do advocate for early administration of basal insulin in their treatment algorithm. This article assesses the rationale and literature associated with the recommendation for early basal insulin administration in the management of DKA. Benefits of early basal insulin in this cohort appears to be associated with less rebound hyperglycemia, reduction in time to DKA resolution, reduced intravenous insulin requirements, and reduced length of stay without associated increases in hypoglycemic or hypokalemic events.

### Fluid treatment for diabetic ketoacidosis in children… [^d30fcc05]. AAFP (2002). Low credibility.

About 20 percent of childhood deaths from diabetes mellitus are related to diabetic ketoacidosis. The appropriate management of DKA includes lowering the serum glucose level and reversing abnormalities in body fluids and electrolytes. However, one complication of DKA treatment is cerebral edema, which can occur if fluid is administered too fast. Some studies report that a rate of more than 4 L per m² per 24 hours is more likely to cause cerebral edema. Recent recommendations have called for lower amounts of replacement fluid. Felner and White discuss a simplified protocol for the management of DKA in children with type 1 diabetes and review complication rates. Children from before and after the protocol change were included in the study if they had a discharge diagnosis of DKA. Children in the first group were given a bolus of 20 mL per kg of normal saline administered over 30 to 45 minutes.

They then were given intravenous human insulin administered at a rate of 0. 1 U per kg per hour. Group 2 received fluid with 0. 675 percent sodium chloride after the initial fluid bolus. Both groups received subcutaneous insulin and food by mouth after their venous pH reached at least 7.
3. Potassium was also administered, depending on serum levels of potassium, phosphate, and calcium. The "before protocol change" group included 363 children and the "after protocol change" group included 502. On average, the new protocol was associated with a per-patient fluid administration rate of
4. 1 L per m², compared with a per-patient rate of 5. 3 L per m² in the old protocol group. Resolution of acidosis occurred more quickly in the new protocol group than in the old protocol group. Total costs per patient were $1, 036 less in the new protocol group than in the old protocol group.

There was no significant difference in the amount of sodium delivered to patients in either group and no difference in the frequency or degree of hypokalemia. Complication rates were very low and not significantly different between the groups. The authors conclude that reducing the rate of fluid given to children with DKA while simultaneously increasing the amount of sodium administered can decrease the number of fluid changes needed, reduce the cost associated with treatment and, perhaps most importantly, reduce the time to resolution of acidosis.

Revisions in Treatment Guidelines for DKD Management

Based on the outcomes of the CREDENCE trial in patients with CKD, the ADA 2020 and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) 2019 consensus statements strongly recommend (strength of recommendation A and 1B, respectively) as a current first-line standard of care SGLT2i in people with T2DM and DKD with eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m², and particularly in those with > 300 mg/g albuminuria, with or without ASCVD, provided they have an adequate renal function.

Safety Concerns and Contraindications With SGLT2i

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors are increasingly being recognized as antihyperglycemic agents for people with T2DM having established ASCVD or multiple risk factors for CVD, and for those with mild-to-moderate renal impairment. However, healthcare providers need to be cautious and vigilant about the specific safety concerns while prescribing them. Regulatory agencies, including the US FDA, the European Medicines Associations (EMA), and Health Canada have issued safety warnings for several AEs. These include AKI, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), genital mycotic infections, urinary tract infections (UTI), bone fractures, lower limb amputations, and acute and chronic pancreatitis. The association of acute and chronic pancreatitis with SGLT2i was reported in the safety review by Health Canada, which concluded that there may be a link between the use of SGLT2i and the risk of acute pancreatitis. However, there was only limited evidence to suggest a link with chronic pancreatitis. Table 3 summarizes the most common AEs associated with the use of SGLT2i.

Methods

Study design, setting and population

The study was undertaken at a large tertiary care center in West Midlands, UK, which serves an ethnically diverse population of over one million people. All people admitted with DKA from April 2014 to September 2020 were included in the study. DKA was defined as blood glucose > 11 mmol/L, pH ≤ 7.3 or bicarbonate ≤ 15 mmol/L and ketonemia ≥ 3 mmol/L. The list of people admitted with DKA was initially screened based on those who meet one of the following criteria: electronic records with pH < 7.3 and blood glucose > 11 mmol/L or referral with DKA to the specialist team or discharged with a diagnosis of DKA. This list was further manually verified for confirmed diagnosis of DKA and only those who met the criteria as per national guidelines were included in the study. Classification (type 1/2) of diabetes was based on a clinical diagnosis as per National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines, although may have been confirmed through islet autoantibody or C peptide testing. Patients who had DKA were identified using an automatic monitoring system, and data regarding various aspects of DKA were collected manually. We reviewed patients' health records to confirm the type of diabetes diagnosis. Patients were excluded from analysis if the diabetes classification was unclear or if this information was unavailable.

DKA management guidelines

The guidelines for management of DKA at our center are based on the Joint British Diabetes Societies guidelines and are the same for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Treatment of DKA includes administering fluids to correct the deficit and replacement glucose infusion when serum glucose drops less than 14 mmol/L but ketosis persists. A fixed rate intravenous insulin infusion was administered based on the patient's body weight at a rate of 0.1 unit/kg/hour to switch of lipolysis. Hourly glucose and ketone measurements are done to check treatment progress. Venous blood gases are done during infusion bag change to ensure the next bag of fluid has appropriate potassium replacement. While the guidelines for DKA management have evolved to ensure simplicity and end-user satisfaction over the last 7 years in our institute, the principles have not changed (figure 1).

Serum potassium, mortality, and kidney prognosis in CKD — Studies have demonstrated a continuous U-shaped relationship between serum potassium and all-cause mortality in a range of different populations, and it has also been associated with worse kidney prognosis. Observationally, the risk of death from the same degree of hyperkalemia is lower in more advanced CKD stages. Note that SGLT2i do not appear to increase serum potassium values. Hyperkalemia has been associated with therapeutic actions of either reducing or stopping RASi, and steps can be taken to mitigate the risk of hyperkalemia and improve potassium control that could increase the use of RASi in people with an evidenced indication.

Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in diabetes — advise persons with CKD in DM about optimal glycemic control, BP control, lipid control, and smoking cessation to reduce risks of development and progression of CKD and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockade with an ARB or an ACE inhibitor is recommended for persons with albuminuria (T1D or T2D) to reduce risk of DKD or CKD in DM progression. A sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) with proven benefit is recommended as foundational therapy for persons with T2D and CKD with eGFR ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m² to reduce progression of CKD and risk of CVD. A glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) with proven benefit is recommended for persons with T2D and DKD or CKD in DM with eGFR ≥ 15 mL/min/1.73 m², for glycemic control and to reduce risk of ASCVD and progression of albuminuria. A non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (finerenone) with proven kidney and CVD benefit is recommended for persons with T2D, an eGFR ≥ 25 mL/min/1.73 m², normal serum potassium concentration, and albuminuria (albumin-to-creatinine ratio [ACR] ≥ 30 mg/g) despite a maximally tolerated dose of a renin–angiotensin–system inhibitor.

### Euglycemic ketoacidosis as a complication of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy [^ef2884a6]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2021). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are drugs designed to lower plasma glucose concentration by inhibiting Na + -glucose-coupled transport in the proximal tubule. Clinical trials demonstrate these drugs have favorable effects on cardiovascular outcomes to include slowing the progression of CKD. Although most patients tolerate these drugs, a potential complication is development of ketoacidosis, often with a normal or only a minimally elevated plasma glucose concentration. Inhibition of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 in the proximal tubule alters kidney ATP turnover so that filtered ketoacids are preferentially excreted as Na + or K + salts, leading to indirect loss of bicarbonate from the body and systemic acidosis under conditions of increased ketogenesis. Risk factors include reductions in insulin dose, increased insulin demand, metabolic stress, low carbohydrate intake, women, and latent autoimmune diabetes of adulthood. The lack of hyperglycemia and nonspecific symptoms of ketoacidosis can lead to delays in diagnosis. Treatment strategies and various precautions are discussed that can decrease the likelihood of this complication.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) inhibitors are new oral antidiabetes medications shown to effectively reduce glycated hemoglobin (A1C) and glycemic variability, blood pressure, and body weight without intrinsic properties to cause hypoglycemia in people with type 1 diabetes. However, recent studies, particularly in individuals with type 1 diabetes, have demonstrated increases in the absolute risk of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Some cases presented with near-normal blood glucose levels or mild hyperglycemia, complicating the recognition/diagnosis of DKA and potentially delaying treatment. Several SGLT inhibitors are currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and European regulatory agencies as adjuncts to insulin therapy in people with type 1 diabetes. Strategies must be developed and disseminated to the medical community to mitigate the associated DKA risk. This Consensus Report reviews current data regarding SGLT inhibitor use and provides recommendations to enhance the safety of SGLT inhibitors in people with type 1 diabetes.

SGLT2 inhibitor monitoring — patients starting an SGLT2 inhibitor should be informed about the "higher risk of genital mycotic infections" and that careful perineal hygiene may lower risk; "Topical antifungal agents can be used" and treatment "may require temporary discontinuation of the SGLT2 inhibitor", while "Oral antifungals can be used but require close attention to corrected QT interval (QTc)". Counsel on diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) risk and symptoms; "Home monitoring with urine ketone test strips may be a reasonable choice in some higher-risk patients", and to prevent DKA "avoid initial reductions in total daily insulin dose of > 20%". Recognize that "Approximately 5% to 10% of adult-onset diabetes is late-onset type 1", who have increased DKA risk and no CV outcomes data. For those "taking insulin or an insulin secretagogue", advise on hypoglycemia risk and that "discontinuing or weaning the sulfonylurea or glinide or modestly reducing total daily insulin dose by up to 20% could reduce the risk", with instruction to self-monitor glucose "during the first 3 to 4 weeks". In patients not on insulin or a secretagogue, "the risk of hypoglycemia is not significantly increased". Advise that a diuretic effect "may be observed", additive with loop diuretics; monitor for volume depletion and "decreasing the diuretic dose may be warranted" if symptoms occur. Kidney considerations include that therapy "may cause a modest initial decrease in eGFR", yet trials show "no increase in acute kidney injury", and "Monitoring renal function in the first few weeks of therapy is reasonable, particularly in patients with impaired renal function at baseline".

### Clinical characteristics and outcomes of diabetes-related ketoacidosis (DKA) in sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) users with type 2 diabetes [^5267ddd6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

Within the DEKODE cohort, individuals with SGLT2i‐associated DKA presented with lower serum potassium levels, had a greater proportion of hypokalaemia events, and fewer hyperkalaemia events during the DKA episode. Several interrelated mechanisms can explain this paradox. First, SGLT2 inhibitors induce glycosuria‐driven osmotic diuresis, leading to increased urinary potassium losses. Second, the associated natriuresis and volume contraction activate the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, enhancing renal potassium excretion. Following initiation of insulin therapy, the intracellular redistribution of potassium can further precipitate hypokalaemia. Collectively, these mechanisms highlight the need for close monitoring and proactive correction of potassium levels during the management of SGLT2i‐associated DKA.

Importantly, intercurrent illness and suboptimal diabetes management were identified as precipitating factors in over two‐thirds of cases, highlighting key opportunities for risk mitigation and prevention. Other studies report prolonged fasting, surgical intervention, and infection as common precipitants. This highlights the need for targeted education for healthcare providers and people with type 2 diabetes to raise awareness and prevent SGLT2i‐related DKA. Individuals who may be at higher risk of ketoacidosis include those with a low beta‐cell function reserve (e.g. type 2 diabetes patients with low C‐peptide, latent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA) or patients with a history of pancreatitis); patients on very low carbohydrate and ketogenic diets, patients on calorie‐restricted diets, patients with conditions that lead to restricted food intake or severe dehydration; or those undergoing surgery. SGLT2 inhibitors should be used with caution in these patient groups. International Consensus guidelines for SGLT2i‐related DKA in T1D have developed mnemonics such as STICHand STOP DKAto streamline protocols and empower individuals to act efficiently if experiencing symptoms of DKA. A similar approach, alongside comprehensive sick day rule guidance, may be needed for people with type 2 diabetes.

In conclusion, we report significant metabolic and clinical outcome differences between patients with DKA and ESRD compared with patients with preserved renal function. Patients with DKA and ESRD on hemodialysis have higher rates of complications, increased resource utilization and hospitalization costs than patients with DKA and preserved renal function. We observed a greater number of patients with DKA and ESRD developing volume overload and hypoglycemia during insulin treatment compared with patients with preserved renal function. These results indicate that a personalized and careful approach to insulin and fluid replacement and correction of hyperglycemia is needed to improve outcome and prevent iatrogenic complications, volume overload and hypoglycemia.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) — effects on chronic kidney disease (CKD) outcomes irrespective of diabetes status — are summarized as follows: two large randomized controlled trials using two different SGLT2i enrolled 19,019 participants with CKD at risk of progression; across a collaborative meta-analysis of 13 trials with just over 90,000 randomized participants, allocation to an SGLT2i versus placebo produced a 37% reduction in kidney disease progression and a 23% reduction in acute kidney injury (AKI) irrespective of diabetes status; the same meta-analysis found a 23% reduction in the composite of cardiovascular death or hospitalization for heart failure irrespective of diabetes status and an approximate 10% relative risk reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE); additional reported benefits include reduced blood pressure, uric acid levels, measures of fluid overload, and risk of serious hyperkalemia without increasing hypoglycemia risk.

### Early insulin degludec with continuous intravenous insulin infusion in the management of diabetic ketoacidosis: a randomized controlled trial [^053aeaa8]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2025). Medium credibility.

TABLE 4
Description of incidence of rebound hyperglycaemia, safety outcome, and other secondary outcomes.

Three participants in the early degludec group received an initial dose of 0.15 units/kg due to CrCl < 30 mL/min. One had end‐stage renal disease (ESRD) and was prescribed a total daily SC insulin dose of 0.3 units/kg/day after DKA resolution, with an average CBG of 182 mg/dL during the rebound hyperglycaemic episode 72 h after transition from IVII. The other two participants had acute kidney injury with CrCl recovering to > 30 mL/min the following day after fluid replacement; both were transitioned to SC insulin at 0.6 units/kg/day after DKA resolution, with average CBGs of 264.5 and 205 mg/dL at 72 h post‐IVII. Additional clinical outcomes are presented in Table S1.

Regarding safety outcomes, the incidence of hypoglycaemia (CBG < 70 mg/dL) and level 2 hypoglycaemia (CBG < 54 mg/dL) was comparable between groups (12.5% vs. 10.0%; p = 1.0 and 2.5% vs. 2.5%; p = 1.0, respectively). One patient with ESRD in the early degludec group who received a reduced dose of insulin degludec developed hypoglycaemia (CBG 58 mg/dL) within 24 h after transition to the full SC insulin regimen (Table S1). The incidence of hypokalaemia (serum potassium < 3.5 mEq/L) was common in this study and showed no significant difference between the groups (50.0% vs. 40.0%; p = 0.369). The serum potassium levels during hypokalaemic events were mild and comparable between groups (3.22 ± 0.19 mEq/L vs. 3.24 ± 0.18 mEq/L; p = 0.715) (Table 4). Additional information on hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia is provided in Table S2. None of the participants developed symptomatic cerebral oedema.

LOS and in‐hospital mortality were also not significantly different between groups (5.23 days [3.65–8.04] vs. 6.63 days [4.04–13.32]; p = 0.218, and 0% vs. 7.5%; p = 0.241, respectively).

### Potassium management with finerenone: practical aspects [^971ceb86]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

4.1 Recommendations for the management of potassium with Finerenone

In accordance with the US labelling prescribing information for finerenone, serum potassium and eGFR should be measured and finerenone should be dosed appropriately in all patients prior to initiation of treatment. Treatment with finerenone should not be initiated if serum potassium is > 5.0 mmol/L. Serum potassium should be monitored periodically, on a schedule similar to study visits in FIDELIO‐DKD and FIGARO‐DKD (Month 1, Month 4, and at 4‐month intervals thereafter) to minimize the risk of hyperkalemia. Importantly, such a schedule is actually similar with the usual biological monitoring recommended in CKD patients by the KDIGO 2012 guidelines (Figure 1).

FIGURE 1
Protocol for potassium management

If serum potassium concentrations are ≤ 4.8 mmol/L, the dose should be continued or increased to 20 mg per day (if the starting dose was 10 mg per day, i.e. for patients with a baseline eGFR 25 to < 60 ml/min/1.73 m 2). If serum potassium concentrations are > 4.8‐ ≤ 5.5 mmol/L, the dose should be maintained at 10 mg daily or 20 mg daily. Serum potassium should be monitored 4 weeks after a dose adjustment and throughout treatment, and the dose adjusted as needed.

This is actually similar to the recommended procedure for RASi oversight, per KDIGO guidelines on diabetes management in CKD, which state "Monitor serum creatinine and potassium (within 2–4 weeks after starting or changing dose)". Finerenone should be temporarily discontinued if serum potassium concentrations are > 5.5 mmol/L and can be restarted at 10 mg daily when serum potassium concentrations are ≤ 5.0 mmol/L. Finerenone has a short half‐life of 2–3 h and no active metabolites; therefore, hyperkalemia can be treated by discontinuing treatment. For patients with moderate liver disease (Child‐Pugh B), additional potassium monitoring should be considered (Table 4).

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^d8ebfb25]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease potassium measurement — Practice Point 3.11.1.1: Be aware of the variability of potassium laboratory measurements as well as factors and mechanisms that may influence potassium measurement including diurnal and seasonal variation, plasma versus serum samples, and the actions of medications. There are several factors and mechanisms that may impact on potassium measurements, including the actions of medications that can increase the risk of developing hyperkalemia. Studies have demonstrated a continuous U-shaped relationship between serum potassium and all-cause mortality in a range of different populations, and it has also been associated with worse kidney prognosis. Observationally, the risk of death from the same degree of hyperkalemia is lower in more advanced CKD stages. Note that SGLT2i do not appear to increase serum potassium values. Hyperkalemia has been associated with therapeutic actions of either reducing or stopping RASi, and steps can be taken to mitigate the risk of hyperkalemia and improve potassium control that could increase the use of RASI in people with an evidenced indication.

### SGLT2 inhibitor-associated diabetic ketoacidosis: clinical review and recommendations for prevention and diagnosis [^4cd5bb5a]. Clinical Therapeutics (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are the newest class of antihyperglycemic agents available on the market. Regulator warnings and concerns regarding the risk of developing diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), however, have dampened enthusiasm for the class despite the combined glycemic, blood pressure, and occasional weight benefits of SGLT2 inhibitors. With the goal of improving patient safety, a cross-Canada expert panel and writing group were convened to review the evidence to-date on reported SGLT2 inhibitor-related DKA incidents and to offer recommendations for preventing and recognizing patients with SGLT2 inhibitor-associated DKA.

Methods

Reports covering DKA events in subjects taking SGLT2 inhibitors that were published in PubMed, presented at professional conferences, or in the public domain from January 2013 to mid-August 2016 were reviewed by the group independently and collectively. Practical recommendations for diagnosis and prevention were established by the panel.

Findings

DKA is rarely associated with SGLT2 inhibitor therapy. Patients with SGLT2 inhibitor-associated DKA may be euglycemic (plasma glucose level < 14 mmol/L). DKA is more likely in patients with insulin-deficient diabetes, including those with type 2 diabetes, and is typically precipitated by insulin omission or dose reduction, severe acute illness, dehydration, extensive exercise, surgery, low-carbohydrate diets, or excessive alcohol intake. SGLT2 inhibitor-associated DKA may be prevented by withholding SGLT2 inhibitors when precipitants develop, avoiding insulin omission or inappropriate insulin dose reduction, and by following sick day protocols as recommended.

Implications

Preventive strategies should help avoid SGLT2 inhibitor-associated DKA. All SGLT2 inhibitor-treated patients presenting with signs or symptoms of DKA should be suspected to have DKA and be investigated for DKA, especially euglycemic patients. If DKA is diagnosed, SGLT2 inhibitor treatment should be stopped, and the DKA should be treated with a traditional treatment protocol.

### Role of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibition to mitigate diabetic kidney disease risk in type 1 diabetes [^5986147e]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2020). Medium credibility.

A recently written consensus report written by international experts highlights the need for appropriate patient selection for SGLT2 inhibition and crucial knowledge available at the medical team. Finally, patients are required to measure ketones in addition to glucose levels and be trained on how to act upon increments, which is uncommon in clinical practice in most countries at present. Despite the usage of ketone metres, DKA rates were significant, which suggests that ketone body measurements are insufficient to mitigate DKA risk in people with T1D.

Hyperglycemic emergencies (diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperosmolar state) — protocols and safety — should follow standardized protocols with aggressive fluid resuscitation, electrolytes replacement, and also insulin therapy, with caution recommended in persons with advanced renal failure because standard IV fluid and insulin replacement may result in increased volume overload and hypoglycemia; severe hypokalemia (K < 2.5 mEq/L) and severe hypoglycemia (BG < 40 mg/dl) have been associated with increased mortality; the addition of noninsulin agents, such as DPP-4 inhibitors or GLP-1 RAs, before admission or during the postoperative period, has not reduced rates of stress hyperglycemia and may increase nausea and vomiting rates among critically ill persons.

2 CURRENT APPROACHES TO THE PREVENTION, RECOGNITION AND MANAGEMENT OF

The standard management of established DKA has been extensively documented in international guidelines. The principles are volume replacement, the correction of electrolyte abnormalities, provision of insulin and addressing precipitating factors, all of which should occur in a hospital environment in which the patient is closely monitored. Patients with DKA may range from early presenters who are mildly unwell and have rapid reversal of their metabolic disturbances to late presenters who are severely unwell with marked disturbances in acid–base balance, volume status and electrolyte abnormalities requiring admission to an intensive care unit. Generally, early presentation with a milder metabolic derangement is associated with lower mortality, faster recovery and lower socioeconomic costs.

The first step in the prevention and management of DKA is recognition of the impending or established condition with a ketone measurement. The measurement of ketones requires that the person recognizes that they are at an increased risk of DKA and to proactively initiate a test to confirm the presence of elevated ketones. Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and thirst occur late, and hyperglycaemia, which is not invariably present, may not always prompt the person to check their ketone levels. Current available options test for the presence of ketones in urine and blood samples.

Glomerular disease — monitoring, sick-day guidance, and management of hyperkalemia and acidosis with RAS blockade: Monitor labs frequently if on ACEi or ARB. Titration of ACEi or ARB may cause acute kidney injury or hyperkalemia. Counsel patients to hold ACEi or ARB and diuretics when at risk for volume depletion, with increased risk for acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia; consider transiently stopping RASi during sick days and counsel patients according to level of education in a culturally sensitive manner. Use potassium-wasting diuretics and/or potassium-binding agents to reduce serum potassium to normal, in order to use RAS blocking medications for BP control and proteinuria reduction, including loop diuretics, thiazide diuretics, patiromer, and sodium zirconium cyclosilicate; each 10 g of sodium zirconium cyclosilicate contains 800 mg of sodium. Treat metabolic acidosis (serum bicarbonate < 22 mmol/l) and supplement with oral sodium bicarbonate.

### Re-examining the widespread policy of stopping sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors during acute illness: a perspective based on the updated evidence [^73cf0fe6]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are now seen as an integral part of therapy in type 2 diabetes to control not only blood glucose but to improve cardiovascular and kidney outcomes. Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is an uncommon but serious complication of type 2 diabetes, which has a high case fatality rate. The absolute risk of DKA in large, prospective randomized clinical trials in people with type 2 diabetes using SGLT2 inhibitors has been low, although the relative risk is higher in those assigned to SGLT2 inhibitors compared with placebo. In those without diabetes but prescribed SGLT2 inhibitors for heart failure or chronic kidney disease, the risk of DKA is similar to placebo. Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, cases of DKA have also been reported in cases of COVID-19 hospitalizations. Consensus guidelines have recommended that SGLT2 inhibitors should be avoided in cases of serious illness and suggest they are not recommended for routine in-hospital use. However, recent data suggest potential beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors in the setting of acute illness with COVID-19 with no increase in adverse events and low rates of DKA, which were non-severe. Given the low rates of DKA in cardiovascular outcome trials and in hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes, the potential for SGLT2 inhibitors not being re-initiated following discharge and their cardiovascular and kidney benefits, we believe the practice of routine 'sick day' guidance should be re-examined based on current evidence with a call for further research in this area. Furthermore, high-quality trials of initiation of SGLT2 inhibitors in people admitted to hospital with cardiovascular disease or kidney disease, and trials of continuation of SGLT2 inhibitors in people, with careful monitoring of DKA should be conducted. These should be further supplemented with large observational studies.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to patients with diabetes mellitus, renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, KDIGO 2020 guidelines recommend to reduce serum potassium levels rather than decrease the dose or discontinue the ACEi or ARB immediately in case of hyperkalemia associated with the use of an ACEi or ARB.
