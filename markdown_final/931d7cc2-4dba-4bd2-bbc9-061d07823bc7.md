## Question

What are the clinical indications for naltrexone?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the clinical indications for naltrexone. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the hierarchy of evidence and primary sources. Then, I should extract FDA-labeled indications and clarify formulation-specific approvals. Next, I will review off-label uses at standard doses and low-dose naltrexone applications. After that, I need to confirm contraindications, precautions, and dosing details. I will then synthesize guideline recommendations for AUD and OUD, assess evidence quality, consider special scenarios such as perioperative care and overdose risk, and finally summarize the clinical takeaways with a clear hierarchy of indications and safety pearls [^111ebJq3] [^1175mSjp] [^111idaHM].

> Let me first confirm the credibility and type of sources to anchor the conclusions. FDA labeling and structured drug information will define labeled indications, whereas major society guidelines (APA, ASAM, VA/DoD, AAFP) will frame best practices; systematic reviews and RCTs will contextualize efficacy and adherence limitations, and the BMC Medicine review will catalog off-label and low-dose naltrexone use, which I will weigh cautiously against trial quality and regulatory status [^111ebJq3] [^114KS3nf] [^111idaHM] [^1175mSjp] [^111T3FGE] [^114yDfTU] [^112Ww5B4].

> I will now examine FDA-labeled indications to avoid assumptions. Oral naltrexone 50 mg is labeled for the treatment of alcohol dependence and for blocking the effects of exogenously administered opioids; SPL entries indicate adult treatment indications for both AUD and OUD, and XR-NTX (naltrexone 380 mg monthly) is approved for alcohol dependence and prevention of relapse to opioid dependence following detoxification, while naltrexone–bupropion is licensed for obesity; I initially hesitated on whether oral naltrexone is explicitly "for OUD", but wait, let me verify the SPL and label language — yes, the FDA/SPL entries do list OUD treatment and opioid blockade, with XR-NTX specifically indicated to prevent relapse post-detoxification, which resolves that concern [^114duyY2] [^114KS3nf] [^116Tkmub] [^112Ww5B4].

> Let me consider formulation-specific clinical roles because adherence and induction are pivotal. Oral naltrexone is limited by poor adherence and is generally not recommended for OUD except under special adherence-enhancing circumstances, whereas XR-NTX 380 mg IM every 4 weeks is preferred in OUD for improved retention and relapse prevention after detox; for selected rapid metabolizers, dosing every 3 weeks can be considered; XR-NTX reduces heavy drinking days by about 25% in AUD, and compared with oral naltrexone, XR-NTX shows superior treatment retention in OUD, though induction onto XR-NTX is harder when detox is required and adherence to injections over 6 months is modest in routine care compared with research settings [^1175mSjp] [^1163D3nr] [^112TFLLb] [^114aQX4V] [^117FqdDv] [^111Tv73G].

> Hold on, I should verify off-label uses at standard or higher doses (≥ 50 mg) so I don't overstate them. The BMC Medicine review catalogs off-label applications with variable evidence — stimulant (amphetamine, cocaine) addiction, certain impulse-control disorders, eating disorders, and autism spectrum disorders — but these are not FDA-approved and evidence tends to be small or mixed, so clinical use requires careful individual risk–benefit assessment and transparency with patients about evidence limitations [^112Ww5B4].

> Next, I should review low-dose naltrexone (LDN ~4.5 mg) assertions. LDN is not FDA-approved; small trials have suggested signal for conditions such as Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, and as an adjunct in HIV infection in some regions, while other conditions such as ME/CFS, CRPS, and autoimmune disorders are still awaiting robust RCTs; I need to emphasize that these data are preliminary and that regulatory status varies by jurisdiction, so clinicians should discuss uncertainties explicitly [^112Ww5B4].

> I need to ensure contraindications and critical precautions are explicit. Absolute contraindications include acute hepatitis or liver failure and current opioid use or anticipated need for opioids; to prevent precipitated withdrawal, the patient should be opioid-free for at least 7–10 days for short-acting opioids, with particular vulnerability for up to 2 weeks when transitioning from buprenorphine or methadone; if a rapid transition is necessary, it must be done in a monitored setting, and even a negative naloxone challenge does not completely exclude risk; hepatotoxicity has been reported, so baseline and periodic liver function assessment is prudent; naltrexone is not associated with physical dependence, and pregnancy data are limited — agonist therapy remains first-line in pregnancy, with naltrexone considered only in selected circumstances with informed consent [^111idaHM] [^115LR54y] [^115ahuC3] [^111ebJq3] [^1143Uras] [^115fGgwB] [^115KeJNG].

> I should double-check dosing specifics so the guidance is concrete. For AUD, oral naltrexone 50 mg daily has evidence over approximately 12 weeks in pivotal trials, though longer treatment may be reasonable based on response; for OUD, oral 25–50 mg daily appears in SPL dosing references but is rarely preferred due to adherence problems; XR-NTX is administered as 380 mg deep IM every 4 weeks, with consideration of every 3 weeks in selected rapid metabolizers; pharmacodynamically, 50 mg can block the effects of 25 mg IV heroin for about 24 hours, and higher oral doses extend blockade proportionally, though the blockade is surmountable with high opioid doses, which is dangerous [^115ahuC3] [^116bDXzq] [^112TFLLb] [^11387xWQ].

> Let me review guideline recommendations for AUD to align indications with best practice. APA 2018 and accompanying guideline statements support offering naltrexone for AUD, and AAFP 2024 recommends naltrexone as a first-line pharmacotherapy to reduce heavy drinking days and improve abstinence; meta-analytic data suggest naltrexone is particularly useful for reducing heavy drinking and cravings, whereas acamprosate may be slightly better for maintaining abstinence, which helps tailor therapy to individual goals; randomized trials, including studies of XR-NTX, support efficacy in reducing heavy drinking days [^111idaHM] [^112m2DZT] [^114yDfTU] [^1111ptfT] [^114aQX4V] [^114N4dfk].

> Next, I should review guideline recommendations for OUD carefully to avoid overgeneralization. ASAM 2020 advises avoiding oral naltrexone for OUD except under limited adherence-enhanced conditions and supports offering XR-NTX as an option when patients prefer antagonist therapy and can complete detoxification; VA/DoD 2021 recommends considering XR-NTX; clinicians should provide or facilitate psychosocial treatment but should not withhold XR-NTX if psychosocial services are declined, and there is no fixed treatment duration — use clinical judgment; shared decision-making is emphasized across guidelines, and for patients unwilling or unable to use agonist therapy, naltrexone can be considered after an adequate opioid-free interval [^1175mSjp] [^1163D3nr] [^111T3FGE] [^111DUty3] [^1159cNtU] [^116iJFfK] [^112FAJjS] [^114phTYk].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about effectiveness without acknowledging adherence and induction barriers. Cochrane reviews consistently show pharmacologic antagonism works but oral naltrexone's clinical effectiveness is undermined by poor adherence and retention; in contrast, XR-NTX demonstrates improved retention and reduced opioid use versus placebo, though induction success is lower in populations requiring detox, and real-world adherence to monthly injections is lower than in research settings; open-label extensions support longer-term safety, but evidence quality and generalizability vary across studies and settings [^115qfimE] [^111vyfnc] [^111Tv73G] [^114XKBNU] [^1127G2xi].

> I need to check special clinical scenarios that change risk–benefit calculus. Perioperative management guidelines converge on holding naltrexone preoperatively regardless of dose or route to permit effective analgesia, though timing and bridging strategies vary; patients discontinuing naltrexone are at increased overdose risk due to loss of tolerance as blockade wanes, so clinicians must counsel about overdose prevention, provide naloxone, and warn that high opioid doses can surmount blockade with life-threatening consequences; robust documentation and family education about heightened opioid sensitivity after discontinuation are essential [^113F7dKx] [^116Tkmub] [^1143Uras] [^116HPtYE].

> Let me first confirm guidance for patients with concurrent AUD and OUD. APA advises offering naltrexone to individuals with AUD and co-occurring OUD who wish to abstain from opioids and reduce alcohol use, ensuring they can remain opioid-free for a clinically appropriate period before initiation, which operationalizes dual-indication utility when detoxification is feasible and treatment goals align with antagonist therapy [^111c9NgM].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost left out a practical induction nuance. Evidence suggests that naltrexone-assisted detoxification protocols may facilitate successful XR-NTX induction better than buprenorphine-taper approaches in some outpatient settings, which can be clinically useful when rapid transition to XR-NTX is desired, though this requires careful monitoring and adjunctive non-opioid medications for withdrawal symptoms [^116qwbph].

> Let me reconsider overall evidence and safety to ensure I am not overstating off-label domains. While serious adverse events with oral naltrexone appear uncommon in placebo-controlled trials across varied conditions, liver safety monitoring remains prudent and off-label or LDN applications should be approached as investigational, with shared decision-making and outcome tracking, given the heterogeneity and small scale of available studies [^112Ww5B4] [^115jt8VK].

> To synthesize, I should double-check that the hierarchy is clear and clinically actionable. The strongest, FDA-backed indications remain AUD and OUD, with oral naltrexone effective for AUD and XR-NTX preferred for OUD due to adherence and relapse prevention advantages; naltrexone–bupropion is indicated for obesity; standard-dose off-label uses have preliminary support in select behavioral conditions; LDN remains promising but investigational; critical safety steps include confirming an adequate opioid-free interval, screening for hepatic disease, counseling about overdose risk during and after treatment, planning perioperative holds, and engaging patients in shared decision-making aligned with guideline recommendations and individual goals [^114KS3nf] [^114duyY2] [^1175mSjp] [^112Ww5B4] [^111ebJq3].

Naltrexone is used for **alcohol use disorder** to reduce heavy drinking and support abstinence [^114yDfTU] [^1111ptfT] and for **opioid use disorder** to prevent relapse after detoxification [^114XKBNU] [^114duyY2]. It is also approved with bupropion for **weight management in obesity** [^112Ww5B4]. Off-label uses include impulse-control and eating disorders and, at low doses, chronic pain and autoimmune conditions, though evidence is limited [^112Ww5B4]. Naltrexone is not recommended for patients with acute hepatitis or liver failure [^111idaHM] or when opioids are needed [^115LR54y]; patients must be opioid-free before initiation to avoid precipitated withdrawal [^111ebJq3] [^115ahuC3].

### Serious adverse events reported in placebo randomised controlled trials of oral naltrexone: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^112Ww5B4]. BMC Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Naltrexone is a pure opioid antagonist with activity at multiple opioid and non-opioid human receptors. It is licensed as an aid to prevent relapse in alcohol use disorders (AUDs) and opioid addiction after withdrawal, and in the combination tablet naltrexone–bupropion for obesity. These conditions are major global health problems, with rising rates of disability and death occurring in many countries. Despite the concern about the impact of these diseases and the need for treatment, naltrexone is currently under-utilized in most countries, particularly for AUDs.

At normal or higher doses (≥ 50 mg), naltrexone is also used off-label for several addictions and impulse control disorders that currently have no licensed drug treatments. These include amphetamine and cocaine addiction, impulse control disorders, eating disorders, and autism spectrum disorders.

Following experimental findings that low doses of naltrexone result in tumor growth suppression and immune modulation, it is increasingly used at doses of around 4.5 mg. This is known as low dose naltrexone (LDN). Small-scale clinical trials of LDN have been conducted in conditions such as Crohn's disease, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, and HIV infection, where evidence has shown efficacy and/or low toxicity. Other conditions for which LDN is used, such as chronic fatigue syndrome (also known as myalgic encephalomyelitis), complex regional pain syndrome, and auto-immune disorders, are still awaiting randomized clinical trials (RCTs). LDN is now licensed as an adjunct in HIV infection for over-the-counter sale.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^111ebJq3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Precipitated opioid withdrawal occurs when an opioid antagonist is administered abruptly to an opioid-dependent patient, causing a severe withdrawal syndrome that can require hospitalization. While spontaneous opioid withdrawal symptoms, associated with discontinuation of opioids in a dependent individual, are generally uncomfortable, they are not typically severe enough to necessitate hospitalization. However, the administration of naltrexone hydrochloride can result in symptoms emerging within five minutes and lasting up to 48 hours. These symptoms may include mental status changes such as confusion, somnolence, and visual hallucinations. Significant fluid losses from vomiting and diarrhea have also been reported, sometimes necessitating intravenous fluid administration. Postmarketing reviews of naltrexone treatment have identified cases where withdrawal symptoms were severe enough to require hospital admission and, in some instances, management in the intensive care unit.

To prevent the occurrence of precipitated withdrawal or the exacerbation of a pre-existing subclinical withdrawal syndrome in opioid-dependent patients, including those treated for alcohol dependence, it is recommended that patients be opioid-free before commencing naltrexone hydrochloride treatment. An opioid-free interval of at least 7 to 10 days is advised for patients previously dependent on short-acting opioids. Patients transitioning from buprenorphine or methadone may be particularly vulnerable to precipitated withdrawal.

### Open-label study of injectable extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) in healthcare professionals with opioid dependence [^117RyLfm]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Antagonist-based treatments combined with psychosocial management are alternatives that avoid some barriers. The use of oral naltrexone is well supported in highly motivated populations or in treatment settings with diligent monitoring to ensure compliance with the oral formulation. Acknowledging the need to improve treatment adherence, the National Institute on Drug Abuse called for the development of a long-acting naltrexone preparation. In 2010, the US FDA approved once-monthly, intramuscular injectable XR-NTX for the prevention of relapse in opioid-dependent individuals. XR-NTX releases naltrexone from microspheres composed of polylactide-co-glycolide, a polymer used in dissolvable surgical sutures. A multicenter, placebo-controlled study demonstrated the efficacy of XR-NTX for the prevention of relapse after detoxification in a general population of opioid-dependent patients. In that 6-month study, patients treated with XR-NTX had a median of 90% confirmed (via urine drug screen) abstinent weeks versus 35% for placebo. Prior studies demonstrated the effectiveness of XR-NTX in the treatment of alcohol dependence as well; XR-NTX is also approved for the treatment of alcohol dependence in abstinent patients.

There have been no prospective studies of an extended-release opioid antagonist in the treatment of opioid dependence among healthcare professionals (HCPs). The primary objective of the present study was to evaluate the tolerability and long-term safety of XR-NTX for the prevention of relapse among opioid-dependent HCPs who were enrolled in standard intensive outpatient care.

### Extended-release injectable naltrexone for opioid use disorder: A systematic review [^111Tv73G]. Addiction (2018). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to systematically review the published literature on extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX, Vivitrol®), marketed as a once-per-month injection product to treat opioid use disorder. We addressed the following questions: (1) How successful is induction on XR-NTX; (2) What are adherence rates to XR-NTX; and (3) Does XR-NTX decrease opioid use? Factors associated with these outcomes, as well as overdose rates, were examined.

- **Methods**: We searched PubMed and used Google Scholar for forward citation searches of peer-reviewed papers from January 2006 to June 2017. Studies that included individuals seeking treatment for opioid use disorder who were offered XR-NTX were included.

- **Results**: We identified and included 34 studies. Pooled estimates showed that XR-NTX induction success was lower in studies that included individuals requiring opioid detoxification (62.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 54.5–70.0%) compared to studies that included individuals already detoxified from opioids (85.0%, 95% CI = 78.0–90.1%). A total of 44.2% (95% CI = 33.1–55.9%) of individuals took all scheduled injections of XR-NTX, which were usually six or fewer. Adherence was higher in prospective investigational studies conducted in a research context according to a study protocol compared to retrospective studies of medical records taken from routine care (6-month rates: 46.7%, 95% CI = 34.5–59.2% versus 10.5%, 95% CI = 4.6–22.4%, respectively). Compared with referral to treatment, XR-NTX reduced opioid use in adults under criminal justice supervision and when administered to inmates before release.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^115ahuC3]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

To reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal in patients dependent on opioids or exacerbation of a preexisting subclinical withdrawal syndrome, opioid-dependent patients, including those being treated for alcohol dependence, should be opioid-free (including tramadol) before starting naltrexone hydrochloride treatment. An opioid-free interval of a minimum of 7 to 10 days is recommended for patients previously dependent on short-acting opioids.

- **Switching from buprenorphine, buprenorphine/naloxone, or methadone**: There are no systematically collected data that specifically address the switch from buprenorphine or methadone to naltrexone hydrochloride. However, a review of postmarketing case reports indicates that some patients may experience severe manifestations of precipitated withdrawal when being switched from opioid agonist therapy to opioid antagonist therapy (see WARNINGS). Patients transitioning from buprenorphine or methadone may be vulnerable to precipitation of withdrawal symptoms for as long as 2 weeks. Healthcare providers should be prepared to manage withdrawal symptomatically with non-opioid medications.

- **Treatment of alcoholism**: A dose of 50 mg once daily is recommended for most patients. The placebo-controlled studies that demonstrated the efficacy of naltrexone hydrochloride as an adjunctive treatment of alcoholism used a dose regimen of naltrexone hydrochloride 50 mg once daily for up to 12 weeks. Other dose regimens or durations of therapy were not evaluated in these trials.

### American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^114PgT27]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control have recently described opioid use and resultant deaths as an epidemic. At this point in time, treating this disease well with medication requires skill and time that are not generally available to primary care doctors in most practice models. Suboptimal treatment has likely contributed to the expansion of the epidemic and concerns for unethical practices. At the same time, access to competent treatment is profoundly restricted because few physicians are willing and able to provide it.

This practice guideline was developed to assist in the evaluation and treatment of opioid use disorder, and in the hope that, using this tool, more physicians will be able to provide effective treatment. Although there are existing guidelines for the treatment of opioid use disorder, none have included all of the medications used at present for its treatment. Moreover, few of the existing guidelines address the needs of special populations such as pregnant women, individuals with co-occurring psychiatric disorders, individuals with pain, adolescents, or individuals involved in the criminal justice system.

The practice guideline was developed using the RAND Corporation (RAND)/University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Appropriateness Method (RAM) – a process that combines scientific evidence and clinical knowledge to determine the appropriateness of a set of clinical procedures. The RAM is a deliberate approach encompassing a review of existing guidelines, literature reviews, appropriateness ratings, necessity reviews, and document development.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, more specifically with respect to naltrexone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines indicate insufficient evidence to recommend a specific duration of naltrexone treatment. The decision on the duration should depend on clinical judgment and the patient's individual circumstances. It is important to recognize that naltrexone can be stopped abruptly without withdrawal symptoms because there is no physical dependence associated with naltrexone.

### Oral naltrexone maintenance treatment for opioid dependence [^115qfimE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Research on the clinical application of oral naltrexone agrees on several aspects. From a pharmacological perspective, naltrexone is effective. However, from an applied perspective, medication compliance and retention rates are very poor.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of naltrexone maintenance treatment versus placebo or other treatments in preventing relapse in opioid addicts after detoxification.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL - The Cochrane Library issue 6, 2010), PubMed (1973 - June 2010), and CINAHL (1982 - June 2010). We inspected reference lists of relevant articles and contacted pharmaceutical producers of naltrexone, authors, and other Cochrane review groups.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized and controlled clinical trials focused on the use of naltrexone maintenance treatment versus placebo or other treatments to achieve sustained abstinence from opiate drugs were considered.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. One reviewer conducted qualitative assessments of the methodology of eligible studies using validated checklists.

- **Main results**: Thirteen studies involving 1,158 participants met the criteria for inclusion in this review. Comparing naltrexone versus placebo or no pharmacological treatments, no statistically significant differences were noted for all the primary outcomes considered. The only outcome statistically significant in favor of naltrexone was re-incarceration, with a relative risk of 0.47 (95% CI 0.26–0.84), but results come only from two studies.

### Pain management in the opioid-dependent patient [^115TZxk1]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2001). Low credibility.

The opioid-dependent patient presents significant challenges for pain management, which are not limited to potential addictive behaviors. While acute opioid intake has profound pain-relieving effects, chronic opioid intake can induce an enhanced pain sensitivity state. Multiple biological mechanisms inducing opioid tolerance and hyperalgesia have recently been elucidated. The potential hyperalgesic state accompanying opioid dependence complicates pain management, particularly for chronic pain, although it also affects acute and cancer pain management. Guidelines for treating opioid dependence in pain patients are proposed. Long-term treatment requires setting limits and providing psychological support, extending beyond simple medication management.

### HIV clinic-based extended-release naltrexone versus treatment as usual for people with HIV and opioid use disorder: a non-blinded, randomized non-inferiority trial [^116R7UrC]. Addiction (2022). High credibility.

Opioid use disorder (OUD) is common in people living with HIV and is associated with decreased receipt of antiretroviral therapy (ART), decreased ART adherence, and decreased HIV viral suppression. Treatment of substance use disorders can increase engagement in HIV care.

Opioid agonist therapy for OUD with either methadone or sublingual buprenorphine decreases HIV transmission risk behaviors and improves HIV and OUD outcomes. However, access to medications for opioid use disorder treatment (MOUD) remains limited. HIV providers are well positioned to integrate MOUD into HIV treatment settings, but thus far, only buprenorphine has been adopted in HIV practice. In the buprenorphine–HIV evaluation and support (BHIVES) collaborative, which demonstrates integrated care for HIV and OUD, people living with HIV and OUD who received buprenorphine from an HIV clinic provider decreased opioid use, increased ART use, and experienced higher‐quality HIV care.

HIV treatment guidelines recommend opioid agonist therapy as a key treatment strategy for engaging people who inject drugs (PWID) in HIV treatment. However, retention on methadone and buprenorphine may be limited due to daily dosing requirements. While the recent emergence of extended‐release formulations may mitigate daily dosing challenges, they are not widely available, and some patients prefer alternatives to agonist treatment.

Extended-release naltrexone (XR‐NTX), a deep muscle opioid antagonist injection that lasts 28 days, may be preferred by some people living with HIV who are seeking a non‐narcotic treatment option.

### The American Psychiatric Association practice guideline for the pharmacological treatment of patients with alcohol use disorder [^111c9NgM]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2018). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for alcohol use disorder, specifically with respect to naltrexone, the APA 2018 guidelines recommend offering naltrexone to patients with an alcohol use disorder and concurrent opioid use disorder who wish to abstain from opioid use. These patients should also aim to either abstain from or reduce alcohol use. It is crucial that they are able to abstain from opioid use for a clinically appropriate duration before initiating naltrexone treatment.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of naltrexone maintenance treatment in preventing relapse in opioid addicts after detoxification.

- **Search strategy**: We searched MEDLINE (1973-first year of naltrexone use in humans-July 2000), EMBASE (1974-July 2000), Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library Issue 2001.4), and handsearched the "Bolletino per le Farmacodipendenze e l'Alcolismo" (1978 to 1997) and reference lists of relevant articles. We contacted pharmaceutical producers of naltrexone, authors, and other Cochrane review groups. The date of the most recent searches was February 2003.

- **Selection criteria**: All controlled studies of naltrexone treatment of heroin addicts after detoxification.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Reviewers evaluated data independently and analyzed outcome measures taking into consideration adherence to and success of the study intervention. Data were extracted and analyzed, stratifying for the three categories of study quality. Where possible, meta-analysis was performed.

- **Main results**: Eleven studies met the criteria for inclusion in this review, even if not all of them were randomized. The methodological quality of the included studies varied but was generally poor. Meta-analysis could be performed to a very low degree only because the studies and their outcome measures were very heterogeneous. A statistically significant reduction of (re-)incarcerations was found for patients.

### American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^112FAJjS]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The choice of available treatment options for addiction involving opioid use should be a shared decision between clinician and patient. Clinicians should consider the patient's preferences, past treatment history, and treatment setting when deciding between the use of methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone.

- **Treatment setting**:
	- The treatment setting described as level 1 in the ASAM Criteria may be a general outpatient location such as a clinician's practice site. Level 2 may be an intensive outpatient treatment or partial hospitalization program housed in a specialty addiction treatment facility, a community mental health center, or another setting. The ASAM Criteria describes level 3 or level 4 treatment, respectively, as a residential addiction treatment facility or hospital.

- **Importance of treatment venue**:
	- The venue in which treatment is provided is as important as the specific medication selected. Opioid Treatment Programs offer daily supervised dosing of methadone, and increasingly of buprenorphine. In accordance with Federal law (21 CFR §1306.07), office-based opioid treatment (OBOT), which provides medication on a prescribed weekly or monthly basis, is limited to buprenorphine. Naltrexone can be prescribed in any setting by any clinician with the authority to prescribe medication. Clinicians should consider a patient's psychosocial situation, co-occurring disorders, and risk of diversion when determining whether an opioid treatment program (OTP) or OBOT is most appropriate.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^116Tkmub]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Warnings**:

	- **Vulnerability to opioid overdose**: After opioid detoxification, patients are likely to have reduced tolerance to opioids. As the blockade of exogenous opioids provided by naltrexone hydrochloride wanes and eventually dissipates completely, patients who have been treated with naltrexone hydrochloride may respond to lower doses of opioids than previously used, just as they would shortly after completing detoxification. This could result in potentially life-threatening opioid intoxication (respiratory compromise or arrest, circulatory collapse, etc) if the patient uses previously tolerated doses of opioids. Cases of opioid overdose with fatal outcomes have been reported in patients after discontinuing treatment.

	- Patients should be alerted that they may be more sensitive to opioids, even at lower doses, after naltrexone hydrochloride treatment is discontinued. It is important that patients inform family members and the people closest to them of this increased sensitivity to opioids and the risk of overdose [see PRECAUTIONS, Information for Patients].

	- **Opioid blockade overcome**: There is also the possibility that a patient who is treated with naltrexone hydrochloride could overcome the opioid blockade effect of naltrexone hydrochloride. Although naltrexone hydrochloride is a potent antagonist, the blockade produced by naltrexone hydrochloride is surmountable. The plasma concentration of exogenous opioids attained immediately following their acute administration may be sufficient to overcome the competitive receptor blockade. This poses a potential risk to individuals who attempt to use opioids during treatment.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^11387xWQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Naltrexone hydrochloride is a pure opioid antagonist that markedly attenuates or completely blocks, reversibly, the subjective effects of intravenously administered opioids. When coadministered with morphine on a chronic basis, it blocks the physical dependence on morphine, heroin, and other opioids.

- **Pharmacodynamic actions**: Naltrexone hydrochloride has few, if any, intrinsic actions besides its opioid blocking properties. However, it does produce some pupillary constriction by an unknown mechanism. The administration of naltrexone hydrochloride is not associated with the development of tolerance or dependence. In subjects physically dependent on opioids, it will precipitate withdrawal symptomatology.

Clinical studies indicate that 50 mg of naltrexone hydrochloride will block the pharmacologic effects of 25 mg of intravenously administered heroin for periods as long as 24 hours. Other data suggest that doubling the dose provides blockade for 48 hours, and tripling the dose provides blockade for about 72 hours. Naltrexone hydrochloride blocks the effects of opioids by competitive binding (i.e. analogous to competitive inhibition of enzymes) at opioid receptors, making the blockade produced potentially surmountable. However, overcoming full naltrexone blockade by administration of very high doses of opiates has resulted in excessive symptoms of histamine release in experimental subjects. The mechanism of action of naltrexone hydrochloride in alcoholism is not understood.

### Long-acting injectable naltrexone induction: A randomized trial of outpatient opioid detoxification with naltrexone versus buprenorphine [^116qwbph]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2017). Low credibility.

At present, there is no established optimal approach for transitioning opioid-dependent adults to extended-release injection naltrexone (XR-naltrexone) while preventing relapse. The authors conducted a trial examining the efficacy of two methods of outpatient opioid detoxification for induction to XR-naltrexone.

- **Method**: Participants were 150 opioid-dependent adults randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to one of two outpatient detoxification regimens: naltrexone-assisted detoxification or buprenorphine-assisted detoxification, followed by an injection of XR-naltrexone. Naltrexone-assisted detoxification lasted 7 days and included a single day of buprenorphine followed by ascending doses of oral naltrexone along with clonidine and other adjunctive medications. Buprenorphine-assisted detoxification included a 7-day buprenorphine taper followed by a week-long delay before the administration of XR-naltrexone, consistent with official prescribing information for XR-naltrexone. Participants from both groups received behavioral therapy focused on medication adherence and a second dose of XR-naltrexone.

- **Results**: Compared with participants in the buprenorphine-assisted detoxification condition, participants assigned to naltrexone-assisted detoxification were significantly more likely to be successfully inducted to XR-naltrexone (56.1% compared with 32.7%) and to receive the second injection at week 5 (50.0% compared with 26.9%). Both models adjusted for the primary type of opioid use, route of opioid administration, and morphine equivalents at baseline.

These results demonstrate that naltrexone-assisted detoxification is more effective for successful induction to XR-naltrexone compared to buprenorphine-assisted detoxification.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^111DUty3]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of opioid use disorder, specifically concerning naltrexone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend assessing the patient's psychosocial needs. In conjunction with extended-release naltrexone, clinicians are advised to offer or refer patients to psychosocial treatment based on their individual needs. Treatment with naltrexone should not be precluded or delayed even if a patient decides to decline psychosocial treatment or if psychosocial treatment is unavailable. It is advisable to utilize motivational interviewing or enhancement techniques to encourage patients to engage in psychosocial treatment services that address their unique needs.

### Naltrexone in the treatment of alcohol dependence [^115XCXjv]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Although naltrexone, an opiate-receptor antagonist, has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of alcohol dependence, its efficacy is uncertain.

- **Methods**: We conducted a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of naltrexone as an adjunct to standardized psychosocial treatment. We randomly assigned 627 veterans (almost all men) with chronic, severe alcohol dependence to 12 months of naltrexone (50 mg once daily), 3 months of naltrexone followed by 9 months of placebo, or 12 months of placebo. All patients were offered individual counseling and programs to improve their compliance with study medication and were encouraged to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.

- **Results**: There were 209 patients in each group; all had been sober for at least five days before randomization. At 13 weeks, we found no significant difference in the number of days to relapse between patients in the two naltrexone groups (mean, 72.3 days) and the placebo group (mean, 62.4 days; 95 percent confidence interval for the difference between groups, -3.0 to 22.8). At 52 weeks, there were no significant differences among the three groups in the percentage of days on which drinking occurred and the number of drinks per drinking day.

- **Conclusions**: Our findings do not support the use of naltrexone for the treatment of men with chronic, severe alcohol dependence.

### Dose escalation of naltrexone to reduce stress responses associated with opioid antagonist induction: A double-blind randomized trial [^114LsKVT]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

The role of opioid antagonist induction involves reducing stress responses and withdrawal symptoms. However, the complexity of naltrexone induction limits its broader applicability in opioid antagonist-assisted abstinence. This clinical trial aimed to assess the stress response to two low-dose naltrexone induction protocols under minimal oral sedation.

The study was designed as a double-blind randomized controlled trial conducted in an open setting in an in-patient unit. Participants included adults with opioid use disorder and a history of opioid use for at least a year. In the intervention protocol, patients received either a single 12.5mg naltrexone oral dose (SI group) or an escalating dosage regimen beginning at 50μg up to a cumulative dose of 12.5mg (ED group).

- **Main outcome measure**: Differences in cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentrations were measured 1 hour after the initiation of naltrexone induction.

In total, 124 patients were enrolled, with 68 remaining in the trial at the point of randomization — 33 in the SI group and 35 in the ED group. Eight patients were excluded from the final analysis. Plasma cortisol and ACTH concentrations were significantly higher in the SI group; the mean difference between groups was 313 nmol/L (95% confidence interval [CI] 182–444, P < 0.001) and 36.9 pg/mL (95% CI 12.3–61.4, P = 0.004), respectively.

- **Secondary outcomes**: SI patients experienced significant increases in plasma cortisol and ACTH concentrations, and withdrawal scores, whereas in the ED group, these measures remained at or below baseline throughout the 24-hour period from the start of naltrexone induction.

### American society of addiction medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^116rGcnF]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The Centers for Disease Control have recently described opioid use and resultant deaths as an epidemic. At this point in time, treating this disease well with medication requires skill and time that are not generally available to primary care doctors in most practice models. Suboptimal treatment has likely contributed to the expansion of the epidemic and concerns for unethical practices. At the same time, access to competent treatment is profoundly restricted because few physicians are willing and able to provide it. This "Practice Guideline" was developed to assist in the evaluation and treatment of opioid use disorder, and in the hope that, using this tool, more physicians will be able to provide effective treatment.

Although there are existing guidelines for the treatment of opioid use disorder, none have included all of the medications used at present for its treatment. Moreover, few of the existing guidelines address the needs of special populations such as pregnant women, individuals with co-occurring psychiatric disorders, individuals with pain, adolescents, or individuals involved in the criminal justice system.

This Practice Guideline was developed using the RAND Corporation (RAND)/University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Appropriateness Method (RAM) — a process that combines scientific evidence and clinical knowledge to determine the appropriateness of a set of clinical procedures. The RAM is a deliberate approach encompassing review of existing guidelines, literature reviews, appropriateness ratings, necessity reviews, and document development.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^116C8NJV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Naltrexone hydrochloride has been shown to produce a complete blockade of the euphoric effects of opioids in both volunteer and addict populations. When administered by means that enforce compliance, it will produce an effective opioid blockade, but it has not been shown to affect the use of cocaine or other non-opioid drugs of abuse.

There are no data demonstrating an unequivocally beneficial effect of naltrexone hydrochloride on rates of recidivism among detoxified, formerly opioid-dependent individuals who self-administer the drug. The failure of the drug in this setting appears to be due to poor medication compliance.

The drug is reported to be of greatest use in good prognosis opioid addicts who take the drug as part of a comprehensive occupational rehabilitative program, behavioral contract, or other compliance-enhancing protocol. Naltrexone hydrochloride, unlike methadone or LAAM (levo-alpha-acetyl-methadol), does not reinforce medication compliance and is expected to have a therapeutic effect only when given under external conditions that support continued use of the medication.

### Use of naltrexone in treating opioid use disorder in pregnancy [^115KeJNG]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Low credibility.

The mainstay of the management of opioid use disorder in pregnancy is with methadone or buprenorphine medication-assisted treatment. Methadone and buprenorphine are opioid agonist drugs. Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, is also a medication-assisted treatment option; however, at the time of writing, only a few retrospective studies have reported its use in pregnancy.

- **Objective**: Our study objective was to evaluate prospectively obstetric and newborn outcomes and the maternal/fetal effects of the use of naltrexone as a medication-assisted treatment in pregnant patients with opioid use disorder.

- **Study design**: We performed a prospective cohort study collecting data on all pregnant women who were treated with naltrexone medication-assisted treatment compared with pregnant women who were treated with methadone or buprenorphine medication-assisted treatment. Based on a sample size calculation, it was determined that for a power of 90, a minimum of 160 study participants (80 in each group) was needed with an alpha of .01 and an expected 60% rate of newborn infants who were treated for neonatal abstinence syndrome in the methadone or buprenorphine medication-assisted treatment group compared with a 30% rate in the naltrexone medication-assisted treatment group. In a random subset of 20 maternal/newborn dyads, blood levels for naltrexone and 6-beta-naltrexol (an active metabolite) were analyzed at delivery.

- **Results**: A total of 230 patients were studied: 121 patients with naltrexone medication-assisted treatment compared with 109 patients with methadone or buprenorphine medication-assisted treatment.

### Efficacy and tolerability of long-acting injectable naltrexone for alcohol dependence: a randomized controlled trial [^114aQX4V]. JAMA (2005). High credibility.

Alcohol dependence is a common disorder associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, has been shown to be effective for the treatment of alcohol dependence. However, adherence to daily oral pharmacotherapy can be problematic, and clinical acceptance and utility of oral naltrexone have been limited.

- **Objective**: To determine the efficacy and tolerability of a long-acting intramuscular formulation of naltrexone for the treatment of alcohol-dependent patients.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: A 6-month, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted between February 2002 and September 2003 at 24 US public hospitals, private and Veterans Administration clinics, and tertiary care medical centers. Of the 899 individuals screened, 627 who were diagnosed as actively drinking alcohol-dependent adults were randomized to receive treatment, and 624 received at least one injection.

- **Intervention**: An intramuscular injection of 380 mg of long-acting naltrexone (n = 205) or 190 mg of long-acting naltrexone (n = 210) or a matching volume of placebo (n = 209), each administered monthly and combined with 12 sessions of low-intensity psychosocial intervention.

- **Main outcome measure**: The event rate of heavy drinking days in the intent-to-treat population.

- **Results**: Compared with placebo, 380 mg of long-acting naltrexone resulted in a 25% decrease in the event rate of heavy drinking days (P = .02) and 190 mg of naltrexone resulted in a 17% decrease (P = .07). Sex and pretreatment abstinence each showed significant interaction.

### A randomized trial comparing extended-release injectable suspension and oral naltrexone, both combined with behavioral therapy, for the treatment of opioid use disorder [^117FqdDv]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2019). High credibility.

The oral formulation of the opioid antagonist naltrexone has shown limited effectiveness for the treatment of opioid use disorder due to poor adherence. Long-acting injection naltrexone (XR-naltrexone), administered monthly, circumvents the need for daily pill-taking, potentially improving adherence, and has been shown to be superior to placebo in reducing opioid use over 6 months of treatment. This open-label trial compared the outcomes of patients with opioid use disorder treated with XR-naltrexone or oral naltrexone in combination with behavioral therapy.

- **Method**: Sixty opioid-dependent adults completed inpatient opioid withdrawal and were transitioned to oral naltrexone. They were stratified by the severity of opioid use (six or fewer bags versus more than six bags of heroin per day) and randomly assigned (1:1) to continue treatment with oral naltrexone (N = 32) or XR-naltrexone (N = 28) for 24 weeks. The first dose of XR-naltrexone (380 mg) was administered prior to discharge, with monthly doses thereafter, and oral naltrexone was given in a 50-mg daily dose. All participants received weekly behavioral therapy to support treatment and adherence to naltrexone.

- **Results**: A Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for race, gender, route of use, and baseline opioid use severity indicated that significantly more patients were retained in treatment for 6 months in the XR-naltrexone group (16 of 28 patients, 57.1%) than in the oral naltrexone group (nine of 32 patients, 28.1%) (hazard ratio = 2.18, 95% CI = 1.07, 4.43).

Further research is needed to test the relative efficacy of extended-release injectable naltrexone as compared to agonist treatment. Further research is also needed on optimal withdrawal management to initiate treatment with naltrexone and minimize the risk of precipitated withdrawal. Additional research is needed about the safety and efficacy of administering extended-release injectable naltrexone every 3 weeks for individuals who metabolize naltrexone at higher rates.

- **Psychosocial treatment in conjunction with medications for the treatment of opioid use disorder**: Further research is needed to identify the comparative advantages of specific psychosocial treatments. Further study is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of psychosocial treatment in combination with specific pharmacotherapies. More research is needed on which psychosocial treatments are most effective for different patient populations and treatment settings, including primary care. Further research is needed on which psychosocial treatments are suitable for addition to buprenorphine or treatment with naltrexone, which can be delivered in primary care settings.

- **Special populations: Pregnant women**: Further research is needed to establish the safety of buprenorphine or the combination of buprenorphine/naloxone for use in pregnancy.

- **Special population: Individuals with pain**: Further research is needed to examine whether the discontinuation of buprenorphine before elective surgery is necessary.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^1175mSjp]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management for opioid use disorder, specifically in relation to naltrexone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend not using oral naltrexone for the treatment of opioid use disorder, except under very limited circumstances because of poor medication adherence. Its use should be reserved for patients able to comply with special techniques to enhance adherence, such as observed dosing. It is acknowledged that extended-release injectable naltrexone reduces, but does not completely eliminate, issues with medication adherence.

### Open-label study of injectable extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) in healthcare professionals with opioid dependence [^114oaTvs]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Nearly three-fourths (28; 73.7%) of subjects voluntarily received at least 6 months of XR-NTX treatment. More than half (21; 55.3%) received 12 or more monthly injections, and 14 (36.8%) subjects received all 24 available injections. Fifteen of the 38 subjects (39.5%) completed 24 months of assessments in the study (16 completed 18 months and 18 completed 12 months), yielding a median time to discontinuation of XR-NTX for all 38 subjects of 404.0 days, or 13.3 months (lower bound of 95% confidence interval [CI]: 183.0 days; upper bound exceeded study duration). However, 5 subjects discontinued after 1 injection. For the 23 subjects who discontinued treatment before 24 months, the median time to discontinuation was 183.0 days, or 6 months.

- **Retention of healthcare professional population**: XR-NTX treatment was tracked over the 24-month study period using a Kaplan-Meier plot.

Psychosocial treatment in this study was treatment as usual; thus, its nature and frequency were not characterized. However, nearly all subjects attended counseling (92.1%) or mutual support meetings (94.6%) over the course of treatment, though the frequency and duration of care varied. In the last study month, 66.7% of completers (n = 10) attended a psychosocial treatment session, and 80% had attended a mutual support meeting in the prior month.

Urine drug tests were conducted at each scheduled monthly medication visit for all subjects. Of all the scheduled and unscheduled (as determined by the specific program requirements) urine drug tests conducted after initiating XR-NTX (n = 519).

### Oral naltrexone maintenance treatment for opioid dependence [^111vyfnc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Research on the clinical application of oral naltrexone agrees on several points. From a pharmacological perspective, naltrexone is effective. However, from an applied perspective, medication compliance and retention rates are poor.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effects of naltrexone maintenance treatment versus placebo or other treatments in preventing relapse in opioid addicts after detoxification.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL - The Cochrane Library Issue 6, 2010), PubMed (1973 - June 2010), and CINAHL (1982 - June 2010). We also inspected reference lists of relevant articles and contacted pharmaceutical producers of naltrexone, authors, and other Cochrane review groups.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized controlled clinical trials focusing on the use of naltrexone maintenance treatment versus placebo or other treatments to achieve sustained abstinence from opioid drugs were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. One reviewer conducted qualitative assessments of the methodology of eligible studies using validated checklists.

- **Main results**: Thirteen studies, encompassing 1,158 participants, met the criteria for inclusion in this review. Comparing naltrexone versus placebo or no pharmacological treatments, no statistically significant differences were noted for the primary outcomes considered. The only outcome statistically significant in favor of naltrexone was re-incarceration, with a relative risk (RR) of 0.47 (95% CI 0.26–0.84), but these results were derived from only two studies.

### Injectable extended-release naltrexone for opioid dependence: a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre randomised trial [^114XKBNU]. Lancet (2011). Low credibility.

Opioid dependence is associated with low rates of treatment-seeking, poor adherence to treatment, frequent relapse, and major societal consequences. We aimed to assess the efficacy, safety, and patient-reported outcomes of an injectable, once-monthly extended-release formulation of the opioid antagonist naltrexone (XR-NTX) for the treatment of patients with opioid dependence after detoxification.

- **Methods**: We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, 24-week trial of patients with opioid dependence disorder. Patients aged 18 years or older who had 30 days or less of inpatient detoxification and 7 days or more off all opioids were enrolled at 13 clinical sites in Russia. We randomly assigned patients (1:1) to either 380 mg XR-NTX or placebo using an interactive voice response system, stratified by site and gender in a centralized, permuted-block method. Participants also received 12 biweekly counseling sessions. Participants, investigators, staff, and the sponsor were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was the response profile for confirmed abstinence during weeks 5–24, assessed by urine drug tests and self-reports of non-use. Secondary endpoints were self-reported opioid-free days, opioid craving scores, number of days of retention, and relapse to physiological opioid dependence. Analyses were by intention to treat. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00678418.

- **Findings**: Between July 3, 2008, and Oct 5, 2009, 250 patients were randomly assigned to XR-NTX (n = 126) or placebo (n = 124). The median proportion of weeks of confirmed…

### Injectable extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) for opioid dependence: long-term safety and effectiveness [^1127G2xi]. Addiction (2013). Low credibility.

The study aimed to describe drug use and safety with intramuscular injectable extended-release naltrexone (XR-NTX) in opioid dependence during a 1-year open-label extension phase. The design involved an initial 6 months of randomized, double-blind, placebo (PBO)-controlled injections given every 28 days. Patients receiving XR-NTX 380 mg continued, and PBO patients were switched to open-label XR-NTX with monthly individual drug counseling for a further year.

The study was conducted across thirteen clinical sites in Russia and included adult opioid-dependent outpatients. Measurements included monthly urine samples, reports of craving and functioning, and adverse events.

Findings from the open-label extension (n = 114) showed that 67 patients continued on XR-NTX, and 47 switched from PBO during the double-blind phase to XR-NTX during the open-label phase. Overall, 62.3% (95% CI: 52.7%, 71.2%) completed the extension. Discontinuation reasons included withdrawal of consent (18.4%) and loss to follow-up (11.4%). Two patients discontinued due to lack of efficacy, and one because of adverse events. Urine testing revealed that 50.9% (41.5%, 60.4%) were abstinent from opioids at all assessments during the 1-year open-label phase. Adverse events reported by 21.1% of patients were judged to be study drug-related. Injection site reactions were infrequent (6.1%) and mostly mild. Elevations in liver function tests occurred for 16.7% of patients, but none was deemed clinically significant. There were no deaths, overdoses, or discontinuations due to severe adverse events.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group Register of Trials (January 2005), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL - The Cochrane Library Issue 1, 2005), MEDLINE (1973 - first year of naltrexone use in humans - January 2005), EMBASE (1974 - January 2005), PsycINFO (OVID - January 1985 to January 2004). We inspected reference lists of relevant articles and contacted pharmaceutical producers of naltrexone, authors, and other Cochrane review groups.

- **Selection criteria**: All randomized and controlled clinical trials focusing on the use of naltrexone maintenance treatment versus placebo or other treatments to achieve sustained abstinence from opiate drugs.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Three reviewers independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data. One reviewer carried out the qualitative assessments of the methodology of eligible studies using validated checklists.

- **Main results**: Ten studies, involving 696 participants, met the criteria for inclusion in this review. Only two studies adequately described allocation concealment. The results show that naltrexone maintenance therapy alone is insufficient for retaining patients in treatment.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^116iJFfK]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for opioid use disorder, particularly concerning general principles, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend ensuring that all approved medications for the treatment of OUD are accessible to all patients. When choosing between methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone, consider the patient's preferences, past treatment history, the state of illness, and treatment setting.

### Perioperative naltrexone management: A scoping review by the Perioperative Pain and Addiction Interdisciplinary Network [^113F7dKx]. Anesthesiology (2024). High credibility.

Substance use disorders, including alcohol use disorder, are a public health concern affecting more than 150 million people globally. The opioid antagonist naltrexone is increasingly prescribed to treat opioid use disorder, alcohol use disorder, and chronic pain. Perioperative management of patients on naltrexone is inconsistent and remains a controversial topic, with mismanagement posing a significant risk to the long-term health of these patients. This scoping review was conducted to identify human studies in which perioperative management of naltrexone was described.

The review includes a systematic literature search involving Medline, Medline In-Process, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science. Seventeen articles that describe perioperative naltrexone management strategies were included, comprising thirteen guidelines, one case report, and three randomized trials. Despite its use in patients with alcohol use disorder and chronic pain, no clinical studies, case reports, or guidelines addressed naltrexone use in these clinical populations.

All of the guideline documents recommended the preoperative cessation of naltrexone, irrespective of dose, indication, or route of administration. None of these guideline documents were designed on the basis of a systematic literature search or a Delphi protocol. As described by the primary studies, perioperative pain relief varied depending on naltrexone dose and route of administration, time since last naltrexone administration, and underlying substance use disorder. None of the studies commented on the maintenance of recovery.

### Opioid dependence: Rationale for and efficacy of existing and new treatments [^115Ei4hL]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Opioid dependence is a chronic and relapsing medical disorder with a well-established neurobiological basis. Opioid agonist treatments, such as methadone and the recently approved buprenorphine, stabilize opioid receptors and the intracellular processes that lead to opioid withdrawal and craving. Both methadone and buprenorphine have been proven effective for the treatment of opioid dependence and can contribute to a decreased risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission. In addition, a buprenorphine/naloxone combination appears to have a decreased potential for abuse or diversion, compared with that associated with methadone. Largely because of these properties, recent legislation now affords an unprecedented opportunity for general physicians to offer opioid agonist treatment through their offices. This review focuses on the neurobiological basis of opioid dependence, the rationale for methadone and buprenorphine treatments, and issues in prescribing these medications to patients with HIV infection.

### Barriers to use of pharmacotherapy for addiction disorders and how to overcome them [^115qi5V4]. Current Psychiatry Reports (2011). Low credibility.

Substance use disorders are highly prevalent, debilitating conditions for which effective pharmacotherapies exist with a broad evidence base, yet pharmacotherapy for the treatment of addiction disorders is underutilized. The goals of this review are to describe the barriers that may contribute to poor adoption and utilization of pharmacotherapy for alcohol and opioid dependence at the system, provider, and patient level and to discuss ways to overcome those barriers. Multifaceted efforts directed at all three levels may be needed to speed pharmacotherapy adoption. More research is needed to help us better understand barriers from patients' perspectives. Strategies to promote adoption of pharmacotherapy for addiction disorders should be modified to fit the needs of the practice, system, and individual patients. Pharmacotherapy is a valuable tool in the clinical armamentarium of addiction treatment; thus, overcoming barriers to implementation may improve clinical and social outcomes.

### Comparing reasons for starting and stopping methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone treatment among a sample of white individuals with opioid use disorder [^116CbdXd]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Despite their efficacy, medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are underutilized in the United States. Nonetheless, few studies have explored reasons why individuals choose to start MOUD or discontinue MOUD after starting, especially extended-release naltrexone. We sought to identify reasons why individuals start and stop MOUD, including the differences between starting and stopping the three most common formulations: methadone, sublingual buprenorphine, and extended-release naltrexone.

We conducted 31 semistructured interviews over the phone with a sample of white individuals with a history of MOUD utilization. Participants were recruited using snowball sampling from eight US states. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, coded in Dedoose software, and analyzed using thematic analysis and modified event structure analysis.

Participants primarily learned about methadone and buprenorphine from other individuals with OUD. Participants primarily became interested in starting buprenorphine and methadone after seeing the medications work effectively in peers, though methadone was perceived as a last resort. In contrast, participants primarily learned about and became interested in naltrexone after receiving information from health practitioners. Participants frequently stopped MOUD to prevent medication or health service dependence. Participants also felt stigma and external pressure to stop buprenorphine and methadone, but not naltrexone. Some participants identified relapse and medication termination by health providers or the criminal justice system as reasons for stopping MOUD.

### A combination of buprenorphine and naltrexone blocks compulsive cocaine intake in rodents without producing dependence [^114rkTuu]. Science Translational Medicine (2012). High credibility.

Buprenorphine, a synthetic opioid that acts at both μ and κ opioid receptors, can decrease cocaine use in individuals with opioid addiction. However, the potent agonist action of buprenorphine at μ opioid receptors raises its potential for creating opioid dependence in non-opioid-dependent cocaine abusers. This study tested the hypothesis that a combination of buprenorphine and naltrexone, a potent μ opioid antagonist with weaker δ and κ antagonist properties, could block compulsive cocaine self-administration without producing opioid dependence.

The effects of buprenorphine and various doses of naltrexone on cocaine self-administration were assessed in rats that self-administered cocaine under conditions of either short access (noncompulsive cocaine seeking) or extended access (compulsive cocaine seeking). Buprenorphine alone reproducibly decreased cocaine self-administration. Although this buprenorphine-alone effect was blocked in a dose-dependent manner by naltrexone in both the short-access and extended-access groups, the combination of the lowest dose of naltrexone with buprenorphine blocked cocaine self-administration in the extended-access group but not in the short-access group.

Rats given this low dose of naltrexone with buprenorphine did not exhibit the physical opioid withdrawal syndrome seen in rats treated with buprenorphine alone. Additionally, naltrexone at this dose did not block κ agonist-induced analgesia. The results suggest that the combination of buprenorphine and naltrexone at an appropriate dosage decreases compulsive cocaine self-administration with minimal side effects.

### The ASAM national practice guideline for the treatment of opioid use disorder: 2020 focused update [^112TFLLb]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of opioid use disorder, specifically with respect to naltrexone, the ASAM 2020 guidelines recommend administering extended-release injectable naltrexone every 4 weeks by deep intramuscular injection in the gluteal muscle at a set dosage of 380 mg per injection. Consider administering naltrexone every 3 weeks in selected patients, such as those metabolizing naltrexone more rapidly.

### Naltrexone hydrochloride [^1143Uras]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

If a more rapid transition from agonist to antagonist therapy is deemed necessary and appropriate by the healthcare provider, monitor the patient closely in an appropriate medical setting where precipitated withdrawal can be managed.

In every case, healthcare providers should always be prepared to manage withdrawal symptomatically with non-opioid medications, because there is no completely reliable method for determining whether a patient has had an adequate opioid-free period. A naloxone challenge test may be helpful; however, a few case reports have indicated that patients may experience precipitated withdrawal despite having a negative urine toxicology screen or tolerating a naloxone challenge test (usually in the setting of transitioning from buprenorphine treatment). Patients should be made aware of the risks associated with precipitated withdrawal and encouraged to give an accurate account of last opioid use.

Patients treated for alcohol dependence with naltrexone hydrochloride should also be assessed for underlying opioid dependence and for any recent use of opioids prior to initiation of treatment with naltrexone hydrochloride. Precipitated opioid withdrawal has been observed in alcohol-dependent patients in circumstances where the prescriber had been unaware of the additional use of opioids or co-dependence on opioids.

- **Hepatotoxicity**: Cases of hepatitis and clinically significant liver dysfunction were observed in association with naltrexone hydrochloride exposure during the clinical development program and in the postmarketing period. Transient, asymptomatic hepatic abnormalities may occur.

### Opioid use and dropout from extended-release naltrexone in a controlled trial: Implications for mechanism [^111B967m]. Addiction (2020). Low credibility.

Extended-release formulations of naltrexone have emerged as effective treatment options for opioid use disorder. This post-hoc analysis examined the temporal relationship between episodes of opioid use and subsequent dropout in a placebo-controlled trial of extended-release injection naltrexone (XR-NTX) to draw inferences about the mechanism by which extended blockade of opioid receptors translates into clinical effectiveness.

- **Design**: This was a 24-week multiple-site, double-blind, randomized trial of monthly XR-NTX versus placebo injections. We analyzed time to dropout from treatment using survival analysis with an extended Cox model as a function of treatment (XR-NTX versus placebo) and with weekly urine drug test (UDT) results for opioids at each week as a time-dependent covariate.

- **Setting**: Thirteen addiction treatment programs in Russia, 2008–2009.

- **Participants**: A total of 250 adults with opioid use disorder who had completed in-patient detoxification.

- **Intervention**: XR-NTX injection or placebo injection every 4 weeks with weekly clinic visits and biweekly counseling.

- **Measurements**: Urine toxicology for opioids measured weekly and week of dropout from treatment.

- **Findings**: The Cox model yielded a significant interaction of time-dependent urine toxicology by treatment (P = 0.024). Among patients receiving placebo, a positive UDT in a given week increased the risk for dropout from treatment in the subsequent week [hazard ratio (HR) = 6.25; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.6–10.0], whereas among patients receiving XR-NTX, a positive UDT result showed…

### Meta-analysis of naltrexone and acamprosate for treating alcohol use disorders: When are these medications most helpful [^1111ptfT]. Addiction (2013). Low credibility.

This meta-analysis explores when naltrexone and acamprosate are most effective in treating alcohol use disorders. The study examines the relative efficacy of each medication, considering their presumed mechanisms of action, such as reducing heavy drinking versus fostering abstinence. It also investigates whether different implementation methods for each medication — such as requiring abstinence before treatment, detoxification before treatment, treatment goals, treatment duration, and dosage — moderate their effects.

A systematic literature search identified 64 randomized, placebo-controlled, English-language clinical trials conducted between 1970 and 2009, focusing on acamprosate or naltrexone. The results indicated that acamprosate had a significantly larger effect size than naltrexone in maintaining abstinence. Conversely, naltrexone demonstrated a larger effect size than acamprosate in reducing heavy drinking and cravings. For naltrexone, requiring abstinence before the trial was correlated with larger effect sizes for abstinence maintenance and reduced heavy drinking compared to placebo. For acamprosate, detoxification prior to medication administration was linked to improved abstinence outcomes compared to placebo.

In conclusion, acamprosate seems to be slightly more effective in promoting abstinence, while naltrexone appears slightly more effective in reducing heavy drinking.

### The nexus of opioids, pain, and addiction: Challenges and solutions [^112t4571]. Preventive Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Pain and addiction are complex disorders with many commonalities. Beneficial outcomes for both disorders can be achieved through similar principles such as individualized medication selection and dosing, comprehensive multimodal therapies, and judicious modification of treatment as indicated by the patient's status. This is implicit in the term "medication-assisted treatment" (MAT) for opioid use disorders (OUD) and is equally important in pain management. However, for many OUD and pain patients, medication is central to the treatment plan and should neither be denied nor withdrawn if critical to patient well-being.

Most patients prescribed opioids for pain do not develop OUD, and most people with OUD do not develop it as a result of appropriately prescribed opioids. Nonetheless, concerns about undertreatment of pain in the late 20th century likely contributed to inappropriate prescribing of opioids. This, coupled with a shortfall in OUD treatment capacity and the unfettered flood of inexpensive heroin and fentanyl, behavioral economics and other factors, facilitated the 21st-century opioid epidemic.

Presently, injudicious reductions in opioid prescriptions for pain are contributing to increased suffering and suicides by pain patients, as well as worsening disparities in pain management for ethnic minority and low-income people. Many of these people are turning to illicit opioids, and no evidence shows that the reduction in opioid prescriptions is reducing OUD or overdose deaths. Comprehensive, science-based policies that increase access to addiction treatment for all are needed.

### A systematic review on the efficacy of naltrexone maintenance treatment in opioid dependence [^117H3Hqs]. Addiction (2002). Low credibility.

The aim was to evaluate the efficacy of naltrexone maintenance treatment in preventing relapse in opioid addicts after detoxification. The design was a systematic review conducted according to the methodology developed by the Cochrane Collaboration, based on either randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trials (CCTs).

Participants included seven hundred and seven heroin-dependent in- and out-patients, or former heroin addicts dependent on methadone and participating in a naltrexone treatment program; 89% were male. The intervention involved maintenance treatments for opiate-dependent individuals after detoxification, comparing naltrexone with placebo, pharmacological, or behavioral treatments.

The measurements considered outcomes such as successfully completed treatment, opioid use under treatment, (re-)incarcerations during the study period, and mean duration of treatment. Findings indicated that the outcomes tended to be slightly, although not significantly, in favor of the naltrexone groups. The use of naltrexone in addition to behavioral treatment significantly decreased the probability of (re-)incarceration (OR = 0.30; 95% CI 0.12, 0.76). The difficulties in producing a quantitative analysis were mainly due to the heterogeneity of the included studies.

The conclusions drawn from the available clinical trials performed up to this time indicate there is insufficient evidence to justify the use of naltrexone in the maintenance treatment of opioid addicts.

### Managing opioid use disorder in primary care: PEER simplified guideline [^114phTYk]. Canadian Family Physician Médecin de Famille Canadien (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the medical management of opioid use disorder, specifically concerning naltrexone, the 2019 guidelines from the College of Family Physicians of Canada (CFPC) recommend considering the initiation of naltrexone in patients who have been opioid-free for at least 7–10 days and are unable or unwilling to use opioid agonist therapy.

### Naltrexone for alcohol dependence: a randomized controlled trial [^114N4dfk]. Addiction (2001). High credibility.

The aim of this study was to examine the efficacy of naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, for alcohol dependence in a sample of alcohol-dependent men.

- **Design**: A 12-week randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial.
- **Setting**: The outpatient clinic of a combined war veteran and general teaching hospital in Melbourne, Australia.
- **Participants**: Male alcohol-dependent subjects recruited from the community and veteran groups.
- **Intervention**: Alcohol-dependent subjects were treated with 50 mg of naltrexone or placebo daily for 12 weeks. Both treatment groups attended a weekly education support group. Subjects were assessed weekly.
- **Measurements**: The primary study outcomes were the maintenance of abstinence and relapse to drinking.

The findings showed that 55 subjects were randomized to naltrexone and 56 to placebo. Forty subjects did not complete the 12 weeks of therapy (17 naltrexone, 23 placebo). In the intention-to-treat sample (N = 111), fewer naltrexone-treated subjects relapsed (p = 0.001). Among patients who completed the 12-week trial, naltrexone reduced the consumption of alcohol. Naltrexone was well tolerated, and there were few adverse experiences.

These conclusions demonstrate that naltrexone is effective in preventing relapse to drinking in the setting of limited psychosocial treatment. Further studies should examine the duration of treatment needed to maintain the effect long term.

### Adapting treatment length to opioid-dependent individuals' needs and preferences: A 2-year follow-up to a 1-year study of extended-release naltrexone [^113JBiEj]. Addiction (2020). Low credibility.

There are three classes of medication for the treatment of opioid dependence (ICD‐10): full agonists, partial agonists, and antagonists. While agonists have been used worldwide for many years, long‐acting injectable versions of the opioid antagonist naltrexone are so far only approved in the United States, Russia, and Ukraine. Administered as monthly intramuscular injections, extended‐release naltrexone (XR‐NTX) blocks the euphoric effects of opioids and offers medication‐assisted abstinence from opioids. Studies have shown that XR‐NTX is an effective, safe, and feasible treatment option. However, the majority of studies on XR‐NTX treatment have had limited time‐frames, and only a few studies have reported results from 12 months or longer. To our knowledge, there are no recommendations regarding clinical treatment length with XR‐NTX based on research or national guidelines.

Opioid agonist maintenance treatment (OMT), which is the World Health Organization (WHO)‐recommended treatment for opioid dependence, is recommended to be open‐ended. At least in Western Europe, OMT has become a long‐lasting or even life‐long treatment. Opioid agonist treatment and XR‐NTX treatment differ in several ways. While opioid agonists maintain the opioid dependence, XR‐NTX blocks the effects of opioids and supports abstinence from all opioids. Two randomized controlled trials suggested that XR‐NTX is equally as effective as the opioid agonist buprenorphine–naloxone (BP‐NLX) in short‐term treatment with regard to retention in treatment and reduction in the use of illicit opioids.

### Naltrexone: Not just for opioids anymore [^114PSZGQ]. Journal of Medical Toxicology (2016). High credibility.

Naltrexone is a semi-synthetic opioid with competitive antagonist activity at mu opioid receptors. Its efficacy has been demonstrated in the treatment of alcohol and opioid dependence, but adherence to daily dosing has been recognized as a factor limiting long-term effectiveness. Recently, a long-acting injectable formulation of naltrexone has received FDA approval for treating alcohol and opioid dependence. This article reviews the pharmacology of naltrexone, the evidence supporting the use of extended-release naltrexone, and the clinical challenges in the induction of patients to this medication.

### Serious adverse events reported in placebo randomised controlled trials of oral naltrexone: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115jt8VK]. BMC Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Why is it important to do this review?

There have been several descriptive, non-systematic safety reviews of naltrexone recently, but none at the time of writing have concentrated on AEs and SAEs in clinical trials of naltrexone. Including studies from a wide range of conditions and concentrating only on a specific adverse outcome that has a regulatory definition should enable a large quantity of high-quality harms data to be collected. People with addictions are reluctant to take, and therapists to prescribe, one drug to overcome addiction to another drug, including alcohol, and practitioners remain concerned about the risk for liver toxicity with naltrexone. Hence, evidence about the safety of naltrexone is needed. Patients taking naltrexone and LDN may do so for prolonged periods of time; therefore, establishing the longer-term safety of naltrexone is particularly important. It may only be possible to discover increased or decreased rates of some SAEs, particularly cardiovascular or cerebrovascular events or cancers in meta-analyses, owing to their generally low background rates.

The primary aim of this review was to examine SAEs occurring in clinical trials of oral naltrexone, given for any condition apart from opioid or ex-opioid use, compared to placebo. Our focus on SAEs accords with the recent emphasis on understanding and preventing enduring or permanent patient harm (rather than examining every AE), as highlighted, for example, in the Dalton review of duty of candour. Further aims were to investigate possible confounders of risk of SAEs for naltrexone by subgroup analyses.

### Sustained-release naltrexone for opioid dependence [^113N95nN]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2008). Low credibility.

Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist that effectively blocks heroin effects. Since opioid dependence treatment with naltrexone tablets suffers from high dropout rates, several depot injections and implants are under investigation. Although sustained-release formulations are claimed to be effective, a systematic review of the literature is lacking.

- **Objectives**: To evaluate the effectiveness of sustained-release naltrexone for opioid dependence and its adverse effects in different study populations.

- **Search strategy**: The databases searched from their inception to November 2007 included the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, LILACS, PsycINFO, ISI Web of Science, trial database at http://clinicaltrials.gov, NIDA monographs, and CPDD and AAAP conference proceedings. The reference lists of identified studies, published reviews, and relevant websites were searched manually. Study authors and drug companies were contacted to obtain any unpublished material or missing data.

- **Selection criteria**: To evaluate effectiveness, only RCTs were included. To evaluate safety, any clinical trial reporting adverse effects was assessed. The treatment condition was extended to include alcohol-dependent subjects and healthy volunteers.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Reviewers independently evaluated the reports, rated methodological quality, and extracted data. Analyses were performed separately for opioid-dependent, alcohol-dependent, and healthy participants.

- **Main results**: For effectiveness, one report met the inclusion criteria. Two dosages of naltrexone…

### Naltrexone maintenance treatment for opioid dependence [^113uBS9g]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2002). Low credibility.

Despite the widespread use of naltrexone maintenance in many countries for more than a decade, the evidence of its effects has not yet been systematically evaluated.

- **Objectives**: The objective is to evaluate the effects of naltrexone maintenance treatment in preventing relapse in opioid addicts after detoxification.

- **Search strategy**: We searched MEDLINE (1973-first year of naltrexone use in humans-July 2000), EMBASE (1974-July 2000), Cochrane Controlled Trials Register (Cochrane Library issue 2001.4), and hand-searched the "Bolletino per le Farmacodipendenze e l'Alcolismo" (1978 to 1997) and reference lists of relevant articles. We contacted pharmaceutical producers of naltrexone, authors, and other Cochrane review groups. Date of most recent searches: December 2001.

- **Selection criteria**: All controlled studies of naltrexone treatment of heroin addicts after detoxification were included.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Reviewers evaluated data independently and analyzed outcome measures, taking into consideration adherence to and success of the study intervention. Data were extracted and analyzed, stratifying for the three categories of study quality. Where possible, meta-analysis was performed.

- **Main results**: Eleven studies met the criteria for inclusion in this review, even if not all of them were randomized. The methodological quality of the included studies varied but was generally poor. Meta-analysis could be performed only to a very low degree because the studies and their outcome measures were very heterogeneous. A statistically significant reduction of (re-)incarcerations was found for patients.

### American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) national practice guideline for the use of medications in the treatment of addiction involving opioid use [^111wRcQc]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

- **Part 6: Naltrexone**: Naltrexone is a recommended treatment in preventing relapse in opioid use disorder. Oral naltrexone may be considered for patients in whom adherence can be supervised, while extended-release injectable naltrexone may be more suitable for patients who have issues with adherence.

Oral naltrexone should be taken daily in 50 mg doses or three times weekly in two 100 mg doses followed by one 150 mg dose. Extended-release injectable naltrexone should be administered every 4 weeks by deep intramuscular injection in the gluteal muscle at a dosage of 380 mg per injection.

Psychosocial treatment is recommended in conjunction with treatment with oral and extended-release injectable naltrexone. There is no recommended length of treatment with oral naltrexone or extended-release injectable naltrexone; duration depends on clinical judgment and the patient's individual circumstances.

Because there is no physical dependence associated with naltrexone, it can be stopped abruptly without withdrawal symptoms. Switching from naltrexone to methadone or buprenorphine should be planned, considered, and monitored. Switching from an antagonist such as naltrexone to a full agonist (methadone) or a partial agonist (buprenorphine) is generally less complicated than switching from a full or partial agonist to an antagonist because there is no physical dependence associated with antagonist treatment and thus no possibility of precipitated withdrawal. Patients being switched from naltrexone to buprenorphine or methadone will not have physical dependence on opioids.
