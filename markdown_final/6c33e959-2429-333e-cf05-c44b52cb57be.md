## Question

18-year-old girl is brought to the hospital by her parents in extremis with rapidly progressive septic shock, with fulminant progression to respiratory distress and intubation. Progresses to refractory vasoplegia and dies in the ICU after 36 hours despite maximal care. Post-mortem blood cultures show group A streptococcus. What ONE thing was overlooked on exam that led to the missed diagnosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what single thing was overlooked on exam that led to the missed diagnosis in an 18-year-old who died of fulminant streptococcal toxic shock syndrome due to group A Streptococcus. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the most likely diagnosis and why it fits the clinical course. Then, I should verify the key early physical findings that are often missed. Next, I will review the pathophysiology to understand why those findings matter. After that, I need to check guideline-based management implications that hinge on early recognition. Finally, I will synthesize the one exam element that, if identified earlier, would have changed management and likely outcomes, and I will double-check that this aligns with the evidence base.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis. The fulminant course with rapid progression to septic shock, multiorgan failure, and refractory vasoplegia, culminating in death within 36 hours, with post-mortem blood cultures growing group A Streptococcus, is classic for streptococcal toxic shock syndrome due to invasive GAS infection, which carries high mortality even with aggressive care and can kill within hours of presentation [^828da846] [^10645976] [^64ad862a].

> Wait, let me verify the key early physical findings that are frequently overlooked. In GAS necrotizing soft tissue infection and STSS, the earliest clue is often severe pain out of proportion to visible skin changes, with woody-hard induration of the subcutaneous tissues and tenderness beyond the erythematous border; early lesions may look like simple cellulitis, but the pain is disproportionate and the tissue feels firm or crepitant, which should trigger concern for necrotizing infection and STSS even before systemic collapse [^0cca2533] [^47c02ede] [^eb69ebcd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm why this matters pathophysiologically. GAS produces superantigen exotoxins that drive a cytokine storm causing vasodilatory shock and multiorgan failure; early deep tissue ischemia and necrosis can be clinically subtle on the skin while pain is severe, explaining why the exam finding is often missed until overt necrosis or systemic collapse appears, by which point mortality skyrockets [^10645976] [^828da846].

> I need to ensure the management implications align with guidelines. Early recognition of necrotizing infection mandates emergent surgical exploration and debridement, plus early antibiotics that suppress toxin production, particularly clindamycin combined with penicillin, and consideration of IVIG for STSS; delays in source control beyond 6–12 hours are associated with worse outcomes, and every hour of delay in antibiotics increases mortality in septic shock, which is why identifying the soft-tissue source early is pivotal [^c2ed2d31] [^5be54feb] [^066d98ad].

> Let me reconsider the question carefully. The ONE thing overlooked on exam that led to the missed diagnosis is the presence of severe pain out of proportion to visible skin findings, with woody-hard induration of the subcutaneous tissues, indicating early necrotizing soft tissue infection as the source of STSS; recognizing this would have prompted immediate surgical consultation and source control, altered antibiotic choices to include clindamycin, and potentially triggered IVIG, all of which could have changed the trajectory in this rapidly fatal GAS STSS [^0cca2533] [^47c02ede] [^5be54feb].

---

The most likely overlooked finding is **early necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI)** — severe pain out of proportion to exam, woody-hard induration, or skin anesthesia — which can be subtle before overt necrosis or bullae appear [^0cca2533] [^47c02ede]. Early NSTI is easily mistaken for cellulitis, but **rapid progression with systemic toxicity and refractory shock** should prompt immediate surgical exploration and debridement, as delays increase mortality [^c2ed2d31] [^5be54feb]. In young adults with GAS, NSTI is a common source of toxic shock and can be missed without a high index of suspicion and a meticulous skin exam [^0cca2533] [^eb69ebcd].

---

## Clinical features of necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI)

NSTI is a rapidly progressive infection of the deep fascia and subcutaneous tissues, often caused by GAS, with **high mortality** if not recognized and treated promptly [^0cca2533]. Early clinical features include:

- **Severe pain disproportionate to visible skin changes**: Often the earliest and most consistent sign, reflecting deep tissue ischemia and necrosis [^0cca2533].

- **Woody-hard induration**: Firm, non-pitting subcutaneous edema due to tissue necrosis and gas formation [^0cca2533].

- **Skin anesthesia**: Loss of sensation over the affected area due to nerve destruction.

- **Systemic toxicity**: Fever, tachycardia, hypotension, and altered mental status, often out of proportion to local findings [^0cca2533].

- **Rapid progression**: Within hours, erythema, swelling, and bullae may develop, followed by skin necrosis and crepitus [^0cca2533].

---

## Why NSTI is often missed

NSTI is frequently misdiagnosed as cellulitis or soft tissue infection because early findings are subtle and can be overlooked without a **high index of suspicion**. Common reasons for missed diagnosis include:

- **Non-specific initial presentation**: Early symptoms such as pain, erythema, and swelling mimic less severe infections [^0cca2533].

- **Lack of obvious skin changes**: Early NSTI may have minimal external findings, delaying recognition [^0cca2533].

- **Failure to recognize pain out of proportion**: This is a hallmark of NSTI but is often attributed to patient exaggeration or anxiety [^0cca2533].

- **Inadequate physical examination**: Failure to palpate for woody induration, assess for anesthesia, or inspect for subtle skin changes [^0cca2533].

---

## Evidence linking NSTI to GAS toxic shock syndrome

GAS is a leading cause of NSTI and is strongly associated with **toxic shock syndrome**, particularly in young, healthy individuals. The bacteria produce exotoxins (e.g. streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins) that trigger a cytokine storm, leading to systemic inflammation, vasodilatory shock, and multi-organ failure [^10645976]. NSTI serves as a common portal of entry for GAS, allowing rapid proliferation and toxin dissemination [^0cca2533].

---

## Impact of delayed recognition and management

Delayed recognition and management of NSTI significantly increase **mortality and morbidity**. Early surgical intervention — wide debridement of necrotic tissue — is the cornerstone of treatment, combined with broad-spectrum antibiotics (including clindamycin to suppress toxin production) and supportive care [^5be54feb]. Delays in surgery beyond 12–24 hours are associated with markedly increased mortality, limb loss, and prolonged ICU stays [^c2ed2d31].

---

## Conclusion and clinical implications

In this 18-year-old female with fulminant GAS septic shock, the most likely overlooked finding on examination was **early necrotizing soft tissue infection** — severe pain out of proportion to exam, woody-hard induration, or skin anesthesia. Recognizing these subtle signs and acting urgently with surgical exploration and debridement, appropriate antibiotics, and supportive care could have altered the outcome. Clinicians must maintain a high index of suspicion for NSTI in patients with severe pain, systemic toxicity, or rapid progression, especially when GAS is implicated [^0cca2533].

### Group A streptococcal septicaemia presenting as an acute abdomen in a child [^b4176e74]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

Group A streptococcus is one of the most frequent pathogens in humans, a normal upper respiratory tract commensal in 5–15% of normal individuals, responsible for a broad spectrum of clinical entities, the most commonly occurring illnesses being streptococcal tonsillitis, scarlet fever and more rarely, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS). First described at the end of the last century, STSS (Group A streptococcal infection associated with the early onset of shock and organ failure.) carries a significant morbidity and mortality (up to 70%), is more common in adults than children and is increasingly being reported in patients who have no predisposing factors. Over the last 15 years however, there has been a significant increase in the incidence and severity of infections caused by Group A Strep, including STSS seen in children, thought to be a response to more virulent and resistant strains of the bacteria evolving. It is more likely to mimic peritonitis than appendicitis, and is therefore an essential differential to be borne in mind when confronted with a peritonitic, rapidly deteriorating previously well child following an initial upper respiratory tract infection, which has failed to improve despite simple medical management.

There are very few case reports of children with Group Strep A. presenting as Appendicitis. We have come across only 3–4 case reports in English literature from 1965. Hence we would like to re-emphasis the need to keep this medical condition on our differential diagnosis while treating appendicitis.

### Fatal streptococcal toxic shock syndrome from an intrauterine device [^0960b02c]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The occurrence of toxic shock syndrome from an intrauterine device (IUD) is very rare.

Objectives

To raise awareness of the risk of toxic shock syndrome caused by an IUD, to educate others about when to suspect this complication, and to provide treatment recommendations.

Case Report

A 49-year-old woman presented to the Emergency Department in septic shock after complaining of 5 days of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Physical examination findings included a diffusely tender and rigid abdomen with free fluid on bedside sonogram. She was found, on computed tomography of her abdomen and pelvis, to have an IUD with moderate ascites. The IUD was removed, and both her IUD and her blood cultures grew out group A Streptococcus. Despite aggressive medical management, which included multiple vasopressors and broad-spectrum antibiotics, she died from group A streptococcal sepsis, with the IUD as her most likely source. Her clinical presentation and laboratory findings meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention diagnostic criteria for streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Her diagnosis was confirmed by autopsy.

Conclusion

IUDs should be considered as a possible source of infection in patients with an IUD who present with symptoms consistent with toxic shock syndrome. These patients need to be aggressively managed with early surgical intervention.

### Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome [^92d7d1d7]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Perhaps more noteworthy than the emergence of Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (StrepTSS) is its persistence for a period of more than 15 years in most geographical areas and an actual increase in incidence in some regions. Early diagnosis remains a problem, and aggressive surgery often cannot be avoided. The continuing rates of mortality and morbidity indicate the need for novel approaches to diagnosis and treatment.

### Septic shock with no diagnosis at 24 hours: a pragmatic multicenter prospective cohort study [^920593da]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Our results thus suggest that the lack of either a source of infection or microbiological documentation, identified at 24 h after vasopressor introduction in patients admitted to and treated in the ICU on clinical suspicion of septic shock, should encourage practitioners to consider the possibility of a sepsis mimicker, which in the current study accounted for almost half of the patients in that group. In other words, more than 90% of patients with confirmed septic shock were diagnosed within 24 h of the onset of shock and infection was secondarily confirmed in only 28% of patients with shock having no clear diagnosis at 24 h. Our study illustrates the wide differential diagnostic spectrum of patients presenting with a clinical phenotype of septic shock.

Practically, when the etiology of a sepsis syndrome appears unclear, our series provides managing physicians with a useful working list of the main sepsis mimickers among medical admissions. The main causes of sepsis mimickers found in our study were classic, with a high proportion of adverse drug reactions, acute mesenteric ischemia, malignancies and inflammatory diseases.

Another important finding of the current study is that 7% of the patients admitted to the ICU with suspected septic shock had shock of unknown origin and that both the ICU mortality and the 60-day mortality rates in these patients were higher than in other patients, including those with a septic shock mimicker. This 7% rate is comparable to the 5% rate of patients with no source of infection or microbiological identification reported in previous large sepsis studies, raising the question whether these patients truly had an underlying infection.

The reason for the higher risk of mortality observed in the SUO subgroup likely involves the lack of available etiological diagnosis and consequently, the impossibility of promptly initiating targeted treatment to reverse shock. In the ICU setting, autopsy studies have been performed to assess the discrepancies between clinical and post-mortem diagnoses. Nevertheless, there is scant information in the literature on the rates of autopsy performed to identify the etiology of lethal shock. Unfortunately, none of our patients who died of shock of unknown origin underwent post-mortem imaging and only one of the three autopsies performed allowed a definite diagnosis (air embolism). Previous autopsy studies suggest that patients with lethal shock of unknown origin may have died from an undiagnosed vascular disease or acute hemorrhage, which are the main causes of missed diagnoses in the ICU setting. In the context of a worldwide decline in the autopsy rate, virtual autopsy involving post-mortem multidetector CT or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combined with 3D visualization may be a new alternative to medical autopsy.

### Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome: a case series emphasizing the urgency of recognition and tailored treatment [^056a5ab3]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a rare but lethal condition associated with Streptococcus Pyogenes Group A (GAS). With rising incidence and high mortality, timely recognition and management are crucial. This case series presents two adult TSS cases caused by invasive GAS, highlighting the importance of early identification and multidisciplinary management.

Case Presentations

The first case involves a 42-year-old male who presented with fever, dizziness, and a tender, erythematous olecranon following an elbow laceration. Despite negative imaging for necrotizing fasciitis, a positive throat swab for GAS prompted immediate broad-spectrum antibiotics and aggressive resuscitation. Clindamycin and intravenous immunoglobulin were administered. The patient developed TSS and acute kidney injury, requiring intensive care and hemodialysis. The second case features a previously healthy 43-year-old female presenting with systemic symptoms and a rash, without trauma history. Positive GAS blood cultures confirmed TSS, leading to similar management and subsequent renal complications requiring hemodialysis. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? These cases highlight the evolving epidemiology of invasive GAS infections and the associated risk of TSS. Early identification and appropriate tailored treatment are essential to reduce morbidity and mortality, especially given the recent surge in invasive GAS. Clinical vigilance for skin changes and thorough laboratory investigations, including non-sterile site cultures, are critical. Early identification enables the use of adjunctive treatments like clindamycin and IVIG, and facilitates appropriate de-escalation of antibiotics. Prompt consultation with infectious disease, intensive care, and surgical teams is necessary to ensure optimal treatment.

### A 7-year-old boy with acute onset of breathing difficulty [^d15cbbc2]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2010). Low credibility.

Group A streptococcus (GAS) is a major bacterial pathogen affecting children globally. Approximately 15% of school-age children experience a symptomatic episode of GAS culture-positive pharyngitis each year. Although the incidence of invasive GAS disease under these circumstances is low (0.5%-2%), an increasing number of invasive GAS cases have been reported over the last 2 decades. This report describes a 7-year-old boy who, after being treated for GAS pharyngitis, developed a fatal streptococcal toxic shock syndrome.

### Group a Streptococcus causing necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome after medical termination of pregnancy [^34a1c7c9]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Group A Streptococcus is an aerobic gram-positive bacteria known to cause cutaneous infections. Invasive infections can lead to toxic shock syndrome with multiorgan failure and mortality rates of 25–48%.

Case

A healthy, young woman developed necrotizing fasciitis, myonecrosis, and toxic shock syndrome after an elective medical termination of pregnancy. This patient had confirmed group A Streptococcus on blood cultures and underwent surgical debridement. After aggressive surgical treatment, below-the-knee amputation, and antibiotic therapy, the patient survived.

Conclusion

This case demonstrates the need for prompt recognition and treatment of necrotizing fasciitis/toxic shock syndrome.

### Group A streptococcal endometritis and toxic shock causing septic pelvic thrombophlebitis and septic pulmonary emboli [^209e6971]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Group A Streptococcus (GAS) in the setting of postpartum endometritis can have severe and life-threatening complications. We report a rare case of septic pulmonary emboli that we surmised to have originated from septic pelvic thrombosis in the setting of GAS toxic shock syndrome (TSS) secondary to postpartum endometritis and intrauterine demise. Although the patient had source control with hysterectomy, she continued to have new septic emboli to the lungs seen on CT scans. CT scan of the pelvis demonstrated several filling defects in the renal and pelvic veins. The patient eventually responded well to anticoagulation in addition to antibiotics, which is similar to cases of Lemierre's syndrome. Additionally, we would like to bring attention to how important radiological findings can be missed if there is lack of interspecialty communication about the patient's clinical situation.

### Point-of-care ultrasound diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis missed by computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging [^2a42e822]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rare but deadly disease. Diagnosis of necrotizing soft tissue infections can be challenging for a variety of reasons. Point-of-care (POC) ultrasound (US) has been described as a diagnostic tool to help the acute care clinician make the early diagnosis that is imperative to optimize outcomes.

Objective

To report a case of Group A Streptococcus NF recognized with POC US, and subsequent negative findings on computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Case Report

A 54-year-old diabetic woman presented to the Emergency Department with atraumatic right foot and lower leg pain associated with fever. Examination was concerning for NF, and a POC US was performed, which showed thickened deep fascia and fluid tracking along the deep fascial plane, with fluid pockets measuring 6 mm in depth, consistent with NF. Surgical consultation was obtained. Per request, CT and MRI of the patient's lower extremity were performed; both were interpreted by the radiologist as showing changes consistent with cellulitis. Septic shock and multisystem organ failure ensued; the patient was eventually taken to the operating room, where operative findings were consistent with NF. Operative cultures grew Streptococcus pyogenes.

Conclusion

NF is a surgical emergency. Early and accurate diagnosis is critical to ensure the necessary aggressive management needed to optimize outcomes. This case illustrates the utility of POC US to make the prompt diagnosis of NF, particularly in light of subsequently negative CT and MRI.

### Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome caused by group G Streptococcus, United Kingdom [^b9c0839a]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

We describe successful management of 3 patients with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) attributable to group G Streptococcus infection. This small series supports recognition of group G Streptococcus in the etiology of STSS. We propose intravenous immunoglobulin be used in treatment as it is for STSS caused by group A Streptococcus.

### Fulminant group A streptococcal necrotizing fasciitis: clinical and pathologic findings in 7 patients [^39c1e4ce]. Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (2002). Low credibility.

Background

Necrotizing fasciitis is a rapidly progressive soft tissue infection with high morbidity and mortality rates. Examination of deep incisional biopsy specimens can provide prompt diagnosis and improve survival. We describe 7 patients with necrotizing fasciitis caused by group A Streptococcus species.

Objective

Our purpose was to describe the unique dermatopathology and clinical features in 7 patients with necrotizing fasciitis caused by group A Streptococcus.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review.

Results

The average age of the patients was 47 years. Fasciitis occurred on an extremity in all cases. All 5 patients with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome died of their disease. The histopathologic findings from early fascial disease revealed superficial epidermal necrosis, edema, and hemorrhage with few inflammatory cells, whereas clinically advanced, necrotic skin lesions revealed diffuse necrosis, thrombosis, neutrophilia, and numerous gram-positive diplococci.

Conclusions

Patients with clinical features of necrotizing fasciitis should have a deep incisional biopsy specimen obtained from the central area of ecchymotic, necrotic plaques to confirm the diagnosis. Immediate surgical intervention is necessary to reduce the morbidity and mortality rates associated with necrotizing fasciitis.

### Top 10 pearls for the recognition, evaluation, and management of maternal sepsis [^784575fa]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). Medium credibility.

The deadliest pathogen in infectious sepsis is invasive group A streptococcus (also known as Streptococcus pyogenes). Group A streptococcus is not part of the normal microbiome of the urogenital tract. It is present in only 0.03% of individuals, so routine screening is not recommended. Group A streptococcus causes a diverse range of infections including endomyometritis, necrotizing fasciitis, pneumonia, cellulitis, and pharyngitis. Patients with group A streptococcus have rapid clinical deterioration; in 75% there are less than 9 hours between the first signs of infection and septic shock, and in 50% of patients this progression occurs in less than 2 hours. Due to this rapid clinical deterioration, about 20% of women will die within 7 days of diagnosis. Although the incidence of invasive group A streptococcus has been increasing globally over the past 30 years, the incidence has remained stable in the United States at 3.48 per 100,000 persons.

Both viral and fungal pathogens can cause maternal sepsis. Pregnant women are at greater risk of viral sepsis than the general population. The most common viral pathogens associated with maternal sepsis are influenza, varicella zoster, and herpes simplex virus. Patients with sepsis from viral infections typically present with pneumonia, but may also present with hepatitis, encephalitis, coagulopathy, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or septic shock. –

Several viral infections confer a high risk of mortality in pregnancy. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), may result in end-organ dysfunction and mortality rate on the order of 1.3% during pregnancy. A rare but important viral pathogen is varicella zoster, which causes chickenpox, and severe infections are associated with mortality rates of 3–14% in pregnancy. The risk for varicella pneumonia increases with advancing gestational age. Disseminated herpes simplex infection, although uncommon during pregnancy, may occur with a primary mucous membrane infection during the third trimester, and carries a maternal mortality rate of approximately 50%.

### Toxic shock syndrome due to Streptococcus pyogenes: case report [^d60c41bb]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is one of the most devastating clinical manifestations of Streptococcus pyogenes (also known as Group A Streptococci or GAS), characterized by an overwhelming production of toxins. The incidence of TSS is increasing worldwide, and the mortality rate remains unacceptably high. Due to the rapid progression of infection, rapid diagnosis is crucial, as early initiation of aggressive supportive measures, along with antibiotics, source control, immunoglobulin, and steroids, can improve patient outcomes. IgM- and IgA-enriched immunoglobulins represents a new therapeutic option, as highlighted in the case reported here.

Case Report

A 66-year-old man was admitted for cellulitis of the right arm with shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), renal and hepatic compromise, suggestive of toxic shock syndrome (TSS). Blood cultures revealed S. pyogenes, confirming the diagnosis. The patient was treated with combination antibiotic therapy (clindamycin, piperacillin/tazobactam), steroids and enriched immunoglobulins in addition to vasopressor and high flow oxygen. He was discharged home with complete recovery after 1 month. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? In the emergency department, the primary goals of management of TSS include aggressive resuscitation, prompt administration of appropriate antibiotics, source control if feasible, and early intensive care unit admission.

### Are invasive group A streptococcal infections preventable by antibiotic therapy? a collaborative retrospective study [^4bde53f8]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Patient Characteristics and Clinical Findings on Admission

We identified a total of 78 patients hospitalized for invasive GAS, of which 63 fulfilled the inclusion criteria (Fig. 1).

FIGURE 1.
Flowchart of patient selection.

Patient characteristics are presented in Table 1. Denominators vary because the available information was not complete for all patients. Six (10%) of 62 had an underlying disease but none was immunosuppressed. The most common clinical feature of invasive GAS disease was fever (95%), with a median duration of 4 days and a range of 0 to more than 10 days before admission. Signs and symptoms suggestive of local GAS infections, such as sore throat or typical rash for scarlet fever, were less common than unspecific signs and symptoms (Table 1).

TABLE 1.
Characteristics and Clinical Presentation on Hospital Admission

Seven (16%) of 43 patients with iGAS disease had a known contact with GAS, usually in a family member, but none had contact with a case of iGAS disease.

Clinical and Microbiologic Diagnosis

The predominant presentations of invasive GAS disease were bloodstream infections, pneumonia (mostly with pleura empyema; 12/14 cases) and mastoiditis (Table 1). About 21 (33%) of 63 patients had more than 1 invasive GAS disease manifestation.

Invasive GAS disease was confirmed by the isolation of GAS from the following specimens of sterile body sites: surgical soft tissue samples, that is, abscesses (n = 25); positive cultures of blood (n = 18); pleural fluid (n = 12); bone samples (n = 6); joint fluid (n = 5); muscle tissue (n = 4); and cerebrospinal fluid (n = 1). In 10 patients GAS was isolated from 2 body sites.

In 3 patients with the clinical presentation of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, GAS was only isolated from a nonsterile site, that is, the pharynx (n = 3).

### Group A streptococcal septicaemia presenting as an acute abdomen in a child [^bf52bdfc]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Case report

Miss AL, a six year old girl was seen in A&E with pyrexia, diarrhoea and vomiting, hip and shoulder pain pyrexia of two days duration. She had also complained of a sore throat and earache of four days duration. Her symptoms were felt to be consistent with a viral upper respiratory tract infection and gastroenteritis. No investigations were performed at this time and she was discharged with Diarolyte.

The patient returned four days later with persistent multi-joint pains; having now developed diffuse abdominal pain and distension and at this point a surgical opinion was sought.

The child was pyrexial and hypoxic, and clearly unwell. Ear, nose and throat examination was normal at this time as it had been one week previously. She had peritonitis localised to the right iliac fossa and an overlying cellulitis. Note was also made of an intermittent roving erythematous but non pruritic rash over her wrists and distal limbs.

The full blood count (white cell count 25.6, neutrophils 23.1 platelets 47) and C-reactive protein (248 mg/L) were consistent with fulminant sepsis.

Following an equivocal abdominal ultrasound scan the patient was taken to theatre.

Laparotomy revealed copious fibrin deposits and a congested caecum and appendix which were not felt to be due to acute appendicitis. appendicectomy was performed.

Despite aggressive fluid resuscitation and broad-spectrum antibiotics (cefuroxime, metronidazole and gentamicin) the patient deteriorated rapidly, developing disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome and acute renal failure. She was kept intubated and required admission to the paediatric intensive care unit for inotropic and ventilatory support for 48 hours post operatively. Blood cultures from admission and peritoneal swabs from laparotomy grew a fully sensitive group A streptococcus at 48 hours, after which her antibiotics were rationalised and she was commenced on clindamycin. Her condition improved and she was discharged from hospital after two weeks with no post infection sequelae to date.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^60b523ab]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign — timing of antimicrobials in pediatric sepsis states that in children with septic shock, antimicrobial therapy should be initiated as soon as possible and ideally within 1 hour of recognition, and despite very low quality of evidence the panel provides a strong recommendation that most clinicians should seek to initiate antimicrobial therapy as soon as possible after recognition of septic shock in most situations. For children without clinical signs of shock, we suggest starting antimicrobial therapy as soon as possible after sepsis recognition, while allowing up to 3 hours for appropriate diagnostic investigation for patients without clinical signs of shock and for those with an uncertain diagnosis. During evaluation, the diagnostic evaluation should be performed expeditiously and, if and when the evaluation supports a likely infection or evidence of septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction becomes manifest, antimicrobial therapy should be immediately administered.

### Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome caused by group G Streptococcus, United Kingdom [^bb2de0ca]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) was defined in 1993 as the isolation of group A Streptococcus (GAS) with parameters indicative of multiorgan dysfunction. STSS remains associated with high mortality rates, even with adequate antimicrobial treatment. Recently, 12 invasive infections with β-hemolytic streptococci of Lancefield group G also fulfilling the criteria of STSS have been reported (mortality rate 83%). The benefit of adjunctive intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) in the treatment of STSS is difficult to prove because the limited number of cases precludes results of sufficient statistical power. Observational studies and 1 small, early terminated, randomized control trial have demonstrated improved survival among patients with GAS STSS treated with IVIg. We describe 3 patients treated in an 880-bed teaching hospital during 2009–2014; all 3 patients had illness meeting the case definition of STSS that were caused by invasive group G Streptococcus (GGS) infection. Successful treatment included IVIg, providing further support for the use of IVIg in treating STSS.

Source control — best practice statement (BPS): We recommend that emergent source control intervention be implemented as soon as possible after a diagnosis of an infection amenable to a source control procedure is made (BPS). Remarks advise that appropriate diagnostic testing to identify site and etiology should be performed and specialist input sought to prioritize needed interventions for source control.

Group C streptococci have been reported to cause invasive disease similar to that classically associated with group A streptococcus (GAS). We describe a fatal case of toxic shock-like syndrome due to Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus. The causative organism did not possess any known GAS superantigen exotoxin genes but did show evidence of superantigen production.

MIS-C or missed diagnosis?

M. Wiggelinkhuizen, G. J. Jaspers

Pediatric Intensive Care, RadboudUMC, Nijmegen, Netherlands

Critical Care 2021, 25 (Suppl 1): P083

Introduction: The objective of this case description is to create awareness among pediatric intensivists about the diagnostic pitfalls regarding Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) and its differential diagnosis.

Methods: By means of two case descriptions, we illustrate and reflect on the pitfalls that led to both under- and overdiagnosis of MIS-C.

Results: Brief patient descriptions are presented in Table 1. The 3-year-old patient was misdiagnosed for MIS-C and turned out to have a perforated appendicitis with peritonitis. The suspicion of MIS-C was based on clinical symptoms in combination with the elevated NT-pro-BNP, which is often seen in MIS-C. However, elevated cardiac biomarkers as NT-pro-BNP and Troponin-T may also be caused by non-cardiac causes, like sepsis, shock and ARDS [1]. The combination of fever, gastrointestinal symptoms and hypotension that were present in this girl, are often presenting symptoms of patients with MIS-C. However, they are not specific and are seen in a range of other diagnoses as well. The 8-year-old girl, with the same symptoms of fever, gastrointestinal symptoms and hypotension, was initially diagnosed for acute appendicitis, but turned out to have MIS-C with left ventricular failure. While no clear symptom or biomarker can distinguish between MIS-C and its differential diagnosis, the presence of conjunctivitis, skin rash and/or coronary dilatation on echocardiography are suggestive for MIS-C, while blood cultures can help to differentiate MIS-C from septic shock / toxic shock syndrome.

Conclusions: Intensivists have to be aware of the existence of MIS-C and the pitfalls of its broad clinical and biochemical abnormalities. Accurate physical examination, including examination for conjunctivitis and rash, echocardiography and blood culture results can be supportive to make the correct diagnosis and to start the right treatment, right on time!

### Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome in the immediate postpartum period [^843b1d7e]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

In the puerperal phase, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is a relatively uncommon occurrence. However, there has been a rise in the prevalence of more aggressive strains of Group A Streptococcus (GAS), leading to significant maternal morbidity and mortality. In this report, we present a case of a postpartum patient who developed streptococcal toxic shock syndrome with substantial inflammation shortly after delivery. The patient presented on the second postpartum day with hypotension, high fever, hypogastric tenderness and anaemia. After timely workup and appropriate antibiotic therapy, the patient fully recovered. Culture studies confirmed Gram-positive septicaemia with the presence of Streptococcus pyogenes in both the patient's blood and a previously inserted intrauterine device (IUD). This case underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for GAS as the cause of puerperal infections despite its rarity. This results in prompt administration of antibiotics and source control, preventing consequences and avoiding mortality.

### Uncommon cause of pelvic inflammatory disease leading to toxic shock syndrome [^df26f054]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

A 44-year-old Caucasian female with a history of endometriosis is admitted to the intensive care unit due to severe left lower quadrant abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting. With patients' positive chandelier sign on pelvic examination, leucocytosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and elevated C-reactive protein indicated that she had pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PCR tests were negative for Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis; however, her blood and urine cultures grew Group A streptococci (GAS) with a negative rapid Streptococcus throat swab and no known exposure to Streptococcus On further review, patient met criteria for GAS toxic shock syndrome based on diagnostic guidelines. The patient was promptly treated with intravenous antibiotics and supportive care, and she acutely recovered. This case demonstrates a rare cause of PID and an atypical aetiology of severe sepsis. It illuminates the importance of considering PID as a source of infection for undifferentiated bacteraemia.

### Exhaustion of the immune system by group A Streptococcus necrotizing fasciitis: the occurrence of late secondary infections in a retrospective study [^b98432f7]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI or 'necrotizing fasciitis') are rare, severe and potentially lethal conditions for which early and adequate treatment with surgical debridement and broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics are essential for survival. Necrotizing fasciitis is associated with significant morbidities such as organ dysfunction and amputations. Delay in diagnosis is associated with higher morbidity and mortality, but diagnosis can be challenging, as no early pathognomonic symptoms are known. When necrotizing fasciitis is suspected, triple diagnostics — based on peroperative macroscopic findings, Gram staining and analysis of fresh frozen sections — is proposed for fast and early conformation of the diagnosis and thus to reduce treatment delay.

All NSTIs (including necrotizing fasciitis, myonecrosis and necrotizing cellulitis) are commonly classified according to microbiologic findings, dividing it in type I (polymicrobial) and type II (monomicrobial). The organism isolated in type II necrotizing fasciitis is frequently Group A Streptococcus (GAS), but other streptococcal species or staphylococcal species can also be found. Evident differences in clinical course and outcome between both types have not yet been clearly described in current literature. However, differences in patient demographics have been previously reported, stating that patients with type II necrotizing fasciitis tend to be healthier and younger compared with type I.

As a result of its often complicated disease course, necrotizing fasciitis is known to impose a high burden on the surgical and critical care and thus on the patient. Specifically, GAS causes an excessive inflammatory response, and might induce a damaged and dysregulated immune system. The fulminant course of GAS necrotizing fasciitis is due to the amplified systematic immune response caused by the release of GAS exotoxins (also known as superantigens), which can lead to toxic shock syndrome. It is hypothesized that the massive release of proinflammatory cytokines causes exhaustion of the patient and the immune system, making these patients more susceptible for secondary infections.

The aim of this study was to assess the occurrence of late secondary infections, with pneumonia as reference, in patients hospitalized for initial treatment of GAS necrotizing fasciitis compared with patients with necrotizing fasciitis without involvement of GAS.

### Household transmission of group A Streptococcus necrotizing fasciitis [^e5b487fc]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

A healthy 40-year-old woman was diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis 2 days after her husband's death from the same infectious process. Prompt identification and immediate surgical intervention prevented a similar result in this patient. Additional investigation into both patients' medical records found the inciting organism to be group A streptococcus. Although the exact mechanism of inoculation is unknown, the spread of this infection within a household prompts the question of whether antibiotic prophylaxis should be given among close contacts in future cases of necrotizing fasciitis.

### Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome presenting as septic knee arthritis in a 5-year-old child [^69643ac4]. Journal of Pediatric Orthopedics (2007). Low credibility.

Group A streptococci, also known as Streptococcus pyogenes, is a common cause of infection in the pediatric population. Recently, the incidence of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, a serious and often deadly manifestation of group A streptococci infection, has increased. Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome often presents with complaints of musculoskeletal pain, which frequently leads to early involvement of an orthopaedic surgeon. In this case report, we present a 5-year-old child who presented with a septic arthritis of the knee, whose final diagnosis was streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. A review of the literature and the aspects of this case report emphasize the emergent nature of streptococcal joint infections and the judicious use of orthopaedic intervention in such patients.

Recognizing sepsis and septic shock in the first minutes to hours of care — sepsis is a confirmed or suspected infection with new or worsening organ dysfunction and dysregulated host response to infection and is not defined by a single datum or finding. Septic shock exists in a subset of sepsis patients with circulatory dysfunction and confers higher mortality; it has a spectrum from hypotension alone to hypotension requiring vasopressor support with an elevated blood lactate level after initial sepsis resuscitation, and septic shock is a severe form of sepsis with cardiovascular dysfunction, usually manifested as hypotension. All patients with impaired cardiovascular function from sepsis are best managed with early detection and prompt treatment. Because sepsis detection can be difficult and the differential diagnosis is often broad, any guideline or care pathway or bundle must accommodate this and guidance is most applicable when the diagnosis of sepsis is established; accurate diagnosis may require advanced or repeated testing and observation to distinguish it from other causes of acute illness. Sepsis is a clinical diagnosis based on a dysregulated response to an infection, and a specific pathogen does not need to be identified for a patient to have sepsis.

### Factors determining prognosis in streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome: results of a nationwide investigation in Japan [^f53ded4a]. Microbes and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

Since the first report of streptococcal toxic shock-like syndrome (TSLS) in Japan, the numbers of reported patients have been increasing. However, clinical manifestations remain somewhat unclear, and factors potentially defining prognosis remain to be identified. We conducted a retrospective nationwide postal survey of major Japanese hospitals concerning clinical manifestations of invasive streptococcal infections including necrotizing fasciitis and TSLS. We evaluated 30 patients who died and 36 survivors. The overall mortality rate was 45%. Physical and laboratory findings on admission were compared statistically between fatal cases and surviving patients. Most laboratory results from the patients who died showed greater abnormality than results from the survivors. Patients who died had significantly fewer leukocytes and platelets, although their C-reactive protein concentrations were similar to those in survivors. Creatinine was significantly higher, and temperature and blood pressure were significantly lower, in patients who died. Patients with invasive streptococcal infections should be managed aggressively when the above features are present.

### Septic shock with no diagnosis at 24 hours: a pragmatic multicenter prospective cohort study [^e462836c]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

The main results of our pragmatic study are as follows: (1) a quarter of patients admitted to ICUs with suspected septic shock had no infection identified at 24 h after onset of shock and almost half of them had a septic shock mimicker; (2) septic shock mimickers were mostly due to acute mesenteric ischemia or adverse effects of drugs; and (3) outcomes did not differ between EC-SS and non EC-SS patients.

We reported a high rate (26%) of patients admitted to the ICU with suspected septic shock and no clear diagnosis 24 h after its onset. This 24-h time point was defined a priori because we believed it relevant to the management of patients with sepsis syndromes, as it practically corresponds to the end of the initial management phase of critically ill patients admitted to the ICU and the time when most patients receive a probable/confirmed diagnosis. We also show that in almost three quarters of these cases (i.e. patients with SUO and SSM, accounting for 19% of the whole cohort), sepsis was not eventually identified, despite an extensive diagnostic work-up with more imaging procedures and microbiological investigations, which is consistent with the 18% rate reported by Heffner et al. in the emergency department. Interestingly, the prevalence of diabetes mellitus was higher in patients with non EC-SS as compared to those with EC-SS, likely because of the large proportion of patients with metformin intoxication, which might also explain the higher rate of renal replacement therapy observed in this group. Conversely, the rate of ARDS was higher in patients with EC-SS, consistent with the fact that pulmonary sepsis, known to be one of the main risk factors for ARDS, was the source of infection in half of cases in this group.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock, 2012 [^9c0292c6]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", last published in 2008.

Design

A consensus committee of 68 international experts representing 30 international organizations was convened. Nominal groups were assembled at key international meetings (for those committee members attending the conference). A formal conflict of interest policy was developed at the onset of the process and enforced throughout. The entire guidelines process was conducted independent of any industry funding. A stand-alone meeting was held for all subgroup heads, co- and vice-chairs, and selected individuals. Teleconferences and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee served as an integral part of the development.

Methods

The authors were advised to follow the principles of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations as strong (1) or weak (2). The potential drawbacks of making strong recommendations in the presence of low-quality evidence were emphasized. Recommendations were classified into three groups: (1) those directly targeting severe sepsis; (2) those targeting general care of the critically ill patient and considered high priority in severe sepsis; and (3) pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations and suggestions, listed by category, include: early quantitative resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 h after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm a potential source of infection (UG); administration of broad-spectrum antimicrobials therapy within 1 h of the recognition of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1C) as the goal of therapy; reassessment of antimicrobial therapy daily for de-escalation, when appropriate (1B); infection source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method within 12 h of diagnosis (1C); initial fluid resuscitation with crystalloid (1B) and consideration of the addition of albumin in patients who continue to require substantial amounts of crystalloid to maintain adequate mean arterial pressure (2C) and the avoidance of hetastarch formulations (1B); initial fluid challenge in patients with sepsis-induced tissue hypoperfusion and suspicion of hypovolemia to achieve a minimum of 30 mL/kg of crystalloids (more rapid administration and greater amounts of fluid may be needed in some patients (1C); fluid challenge technique continued as long as hemodynamic improvement is based on either dynamic or static variables (UG); norepinephrine as the first-choice vasopressor to maintain mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mmHg (1B); epinephrine when an additional agent is needed to maintain adequate blood pressure (2B); vasopressin (0.03 U/min) can be added to norepinephrine to either raise mean arterial pressure to target or to decrease norepinephrine dose but should not be used as the initial vasopressor (UG); dopamine is not recommended except in highly selected circumstances (2C); dobutamine infusion administered or added to vasopressor in the presence of (a) myocardial dysfunction as suggested by elevated cardiac filling pressures and low cardiac output, or (b) ongoing signs of hypoperfusion despite achieving adequate intravascular volume and adequate mean arterial pressure (1C); avoiding use of intravenous hydrocortisone in adult septic shock patients if adequate fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy are able to restore hemodynamic stability (2C); hemoglobin target of 7–9 g/dL in the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, ischemic coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage (1B); low tidal volume (1A) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure (1B) for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS (1B); higher rather than lower level of PEEP for patients with sepsis-induced moderate or severe ARDS (2C); recruitment maneuvers in sepsis patients with severe refractory hypoxemia due to ARDS (2C); prone positioning in sepsis-induced ARDS patients with a PaO (2)/FiO (2) ratio of ≤ 100 mm Hg in facilities that have experience with such practices (2C); head-of-bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ARDS who do not have evidence of tissue hypoperfusion (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation (1A); minimizing use of either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation targeting specific titration endpoints (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers if possible in the septic patient without ARDS (1C); a short course of neuromuscular blocker (no longer than 48 h) for patients with early ARDS and a PaO (2)/FI O (2) < 150 mm Hg (2C); a protocolized approach to blood glucose management commencing insulin dosing when two consecutive blood glucose levels are > 180 mg/dL, targeting an upper blood glucose ≤ 180 mg/dL (1A); equivalency of continuous veno-venous hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1B); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with bleeding risk factors (1B); oral or enteral (if necessary) feedings, as tolerated, rather than either complete fasting or provision of only intravenous glucose within the first 48 h after a diagnosis of severe sepsis/septic shock (2C); and addressing goals of care, including treatment plans and end-of-life planning (as appropriate) (1B), as early as feasible, but within 72 h of intensive care unit admission (2C). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: therapy with face mask oxygen, high flow nasal cannula oxygen, or nasopharyngeal continuous PEEP in the presence of respiratory distress and hypoxemia (2C), use of physical examination therapeutic endpoints such as capillary refill (2C); for septic shock associated with hypovolemia, the use of crystalloids or albumin to deliver a bolus of 20 mL/kg of crystalloids (or albumin equivalent) over 5–10 min (2C); more common use of inotropes and vasodilators for low cardiac output septic shock associated with elevated systemic vascular resistance (2C); and use of hydrocortisone only in children with suspected or proven "absolute"' adrenal insufficiency (2C).

Conclusions

Strong agreement existed among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best care of patients with severe sepsis. Although a significant number of aspects of care have relatively weak support, evidence-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the foundation of improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Gram-positive toxic shock syndromes [^10645976]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2009). Medium credibility.

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is an acute, multi-system, toxin-mediated illness, often resulting in multi-organ failure. It represents the most fulminant expression of a spectrum of diseases caused by toxin-producing strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes (group A streptococcus). The importance of Gram-positive organisms as pathogens is increasing, and TSS is likely to be underdiagnosed in patients with staphylococcal or group A streptococcal infection who present with shock. TSS results from the ability of bacterial toxins to act as superantigens, stimulating immune-cell expansion and rampant cytokine expression in a manner that bypasses normal MHC-restricted antigen processing. A repetitive cycle of cell stimulation and cytokine release results in a cytokine avalanche that causes tissue damage, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and organ dysfunction. Specific therapy focuses on early identification of the illness, source control, and administration on antimicrobial agents including drugs capable of suppressing toxin production (eg, clindamycin, linezolid). Intravenous immunoglobulin has the potential to neutralise superantigen and to mitigate subsequent tissue damage.

### Management of neonates born at ≥ 35 0 / 7 weeks' gestation with suspected or proven early-onset bacterial sepsis [^1d9e4bec]. Pediatrics (2018). Medium credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for sepsis and septic shock, more specifically with respect to neonates, management, AAP 2018 guidelines recommend to administer ampicillin plus gentamicin as the first choice for empirical therapy for early-onset sepsis, as this regimen is effective against group B streptococcus, most other streptococcal and enterococcal species, and L. monocytogenes. Recognize that although two-thirds of E. coli early-onset sepsis isolates and most other Gram-negative early-onset sepsis isolates are resistant to ampicillin, the majority remain sensitive to gentamicin. Consider administering additional broad-spectrum agents in term infants who are critically ill until appropriate culture results are known.

### Septic shock with no diagnosis at 24 hours: a pragmatic multicenter prospective cohort study [^1b8b0ffe]. Critical Care (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The lack of a patent source of infection and/or the absence of microbiological documentation is not uncommon during the first hours of management of patients presenting with a clinical phenotype of septic shock. Study of a large series of patients with sepsis in the intensive care unit (ICU) reveals that approximately 5% of patients with shock initially deemed to be septic had neither source of infection nor microbiological documentation retrieved by the end of the ICU stay, raising the question whether these patients truly had an underlying infection. In a monocentric study, Heffner et al. showed that 18% of patients diagnosed with sepsis had in fact a non-infectious condition that mimicked sepsis (sepsis mimicker). Two previous retrospective studies both showed that 13% of the patients admitted to the ICU with suspected sepsis had in fact no infection identified; interestingly, these patients had a higher mortality rate as compared with those having an identified infection. The causes of sepsis mimickers are numerous and typically include adrenal insufficiency, acute pancreatitis, drug adverse effects, lymphoma, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or tumor lysis syndrome.

The presence of an infectious process is by definition necessary to discriminate between sepsis and sepsis mimickers. However, patients with sepsis mimickers have a clinical phenotype that resembles that of patients with sepsis, so that antimicrobial agents are usually administered within the first hours of recognition of shock, until infection is ruled out and an alternative non-infectious diagnosis is made.

Managing a patient with a clinical phenotype of septic shock and with no clear diagnosis (lack of both a source of infection and microbiological documentation) within the first 24 hours of vasopressor introduction is a common but disturbing and challenging clinical scenario reflected by the often quoted question "what does my patient have?" heard during morning rounds in many ICUs. To our knowledge, the prevalence, the causes and the prognosis of suspected septic shock with no early (i.e. 24 h after vasopressor introduction) etiological diagnosis (i.e. non-early-confirmed septic shock) have never been assessed in a large series.

We conducted a pragmatic, prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study including patients initially considered to have septic shock, in which we aimed to: (1) determine the prevalence of non-early-confirmed septic shock, as defined by the lack of a definite source of infection and microbiological documentation within 24 h of shock onset; (2) identify the main causes of non-early-confirmed septic shock; and (3) compare the outcome of patients with and without early-confirmed septic shock.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of sepsis and septic shock 2021 [^c2ed2d31]. Intensive Care Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Sepsis and septic shock — source control timing and method selection — source control should be achieved as soon as possible following initial resuscitation, with smaller studies suggesting that source control within 6 to 12 hours is advantageous and studies generally showing reduced survival beyond that point; the failure to show benefit with source control implemented in less than 6 hours may be a consequence of limited numbers and heterogeneity. Prolonged efforts at medical stabilization in lieu of source control for severely ill patients, particularly those with septic shock, are generally not advised. Selection of optimal source control methods must weigh benefits and risks, pursue the least invasive option that will effectively achieve source control, consider open surgical intervention when other interventional approaches are inadequate or cannot be provided in a timely fashion, and recognize that surgical exploration may be indicated when diagnostic uncertainty persists despite radiologic evaluation or when the probability of success with percutaneous procedures is uncertain or the undesirable effects of a failed procedure are high.

### Household transmission of group A Streptococcus necrotizing fasciitis [^a7778d14]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

NF secondary to GAS is a severe infectious process that requires emergent surgical intervention. Although it may present as an indolent, benign cellulitis, high suspicion must remain if there are worsening symptoms or hemodynamic instability in these patients. GAS can be transmitted across close contacts and manifest as NF, so chemoprophylaxis consisting of penicillin or clindamycin should be considered for close contacts.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^d8fca1fa]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Pediatric sepsis — source control — We recommend that emergent source control intervention be implemented as soon possible after a diagnosis of an infection amenable to a source control procedure is made (BPS). Appropriate diagnostic testing to identify the site of infection and microbial etiology should be performed, and advice from specialist teams (e.g., infectious diseases, surgery) should be sought, as appropriate, in order to prioritize interventions needed to achieve source control.

### The evaluation and management of toxic shock syndrome in the emergency department: a review of the literature [^d098266d]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a severe, toxin-mediated illness that can mimic several other diseases and is lethal if not recognized and treated appropriately.

Objective

This review provides an emergency medicine evidence-based summary of the current evaluation and treatment of TSS.

Discussion

The most common etiologic agents are Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Sources of TSS include postsurgical wounds, postpartum, postabortion, burns, soft tissue injuries, pharyngitis, and focal infections. Symptoms are due to toxin production and infection focus. Early symptoms include fever, chills, malaise, rash, vomiting, diarrhea, and hypotension. Diffuse erythema and desquamation may occur later in the disease course. Laboratory assessment may demonstrate anemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal coagulation studies. Diagnostic criteria are available to facilitate the diagnosis, but they should not be relied on for definitive diagnosis. Rather, specific situations should trigger consideration of this disease process. Treatment involves intravenous fluids, source control, and antibiotics. Antibiotics should include a penicillinase-resistant penicillin, cephalosporin, or vancomycin (in methicillin-resistant S. aureus prevalent areas) along with either clindamycin or linezolid.

Conclusion

TSS is a potentially deadly disease requiring prompt recognition and treatment. Focused history, physical examination, and laboratory testing are important for the diagnosis and management of this disease. Understanding the evaluation and treatment of TSS can assist providers with effectively managing these patients.

### Current diagnosis and management of necrotizing soft tissue infections: what you need to know [^47c02ede]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Necrotizing soft tissue infections are rare bacterial infections of the skin and soft tissues with a high morbidity and mortality rate, requiring prompt diagnosis and surgical intervention. These represent a spectrum of disease resulting in tissue necrosis that is rapidly progressive; however, they remain a diagnostic challenge because the average surgeon or emergency medicine provider may only see one or two over the course of their career. Diagnosis is largely clinical and based on subtle physical examination findings, physiologic instability, and laboratory derangements. Aids to diagnosis such as scoring systems and cross-sectional imaging may be used; however, the findings are not specific, so management should not be based on these alone. The most common cause of necrotizing soft tissue infection is polymicrobial infection; however, specific bacteria such as clostridial species, group A streptococcal, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and aquatic bacteria may also be causative. Initial management includes broad spectrum antibiotics, fluid resuscitation for severe sepsis, and early aggressive surgical debridement. Often, these patients require multiple operative debridement to achieve source control, and a low threshold for repeat debridement should be maintained because these infections can progress rapidly. Once source control is achieved, patients may be left with extensive wounds requiring multidisciplinary care and wound management. Necrotizing infections have long been viewed based on mortality outcomes alone because of their rarity and severity. Over recent years, more reports have shown a decrease in the mortality rates from those previously reported, allowing for a focus on methods to improve morbidity of these infections.

### Waterhouse-friderichsen syndrome as a result of non-meningococcal infection [^514a2a87]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome — massive adrenal haemorrhage in the setting of overwhelming clinical sepsis — is usually taken at necropsy to indicate meningococcal infection, and may be the only evidence of this pathogen. This report describes three fatal cases of the syndrome in which the causative organism proved to be a streptococcus. The organisms were detected during routine coroners' autopsies with histology and microbiological investigations. In two cases, the syndrome followed Streptococcus pneumoniae infection and in a third beta haemolytic streptococcus group A. Thus, adrenal haemorrhage alone cannot be taken to indicate meningococcal disease and other pathogens, particularly streptococcus, must be considered.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^d3ea2284]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Surviving Sepsis Campaign pediatric sepsis — antimicrobial therapy category definitions specify that empiric antimicrobial therapy is initial antimicrobial therapy started for suspected infection in the absence of definitive microbiologic pathogen identification and may consist of single or multiple agents but should be broad spectrum in nature and should be based on local, regional, or national pathogen epidemiology and patient risk factors. Targeted/definitive antimicrobial therapy is antimicrobial therapy targeted to specific pathogen(s), usually after microbiologic identification, and may consist of single or multiple agents, but should not be broader than required to treat the specific pathogen(s) after microbiologic identification. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy is an antimicrobial regimen with activity against multiple different groups of bacteria or other pathogens considered to be likely causes of the clinical presentation and may consist of single or multiple agents. Multiple-drug antimicrobial therapy is when more than one antimicrobial agent is needed to expand coverage, decrease the likelihood of resistance to any particular single agent, or provide synergy to treat a suspected or known pathogen.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^5be54feb]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis — surgical and antimicrobial management centers on urgent debridement, broad coverage for aerobes including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and targeted therapy for group A streptococcus. Surgical intervention is the primary therapeutic modality and is indicated when infection is confirmed or suspected, and most patients should return to the operating room 24–36 hours after the first debridement and then daily until no further debridement is needed. In the absence of definitive trials, antimicrobial therapy should continue until further debridement is unnecessary, the patient has improved clinically, and fever has been absent for 48–72 hours. For polymicrobial infections, treatment should cover both aerobes, including MRSA, and anaerobes, using vancomycin, linezolid, or daptomycin combined with one of piperacillin-tazobactam, a carbapenem (imipenem-cilastatin, meropenem, and ertapenem), ceftriaxone plus metronidazole, or a fluoroquinolone plus metronidazole, with coverage modified once microbiology is known. Necrotizing fasciitis and/or streptococcal toxic shock syndrome caused by group A streptococcus should be treated with both clindamycin and penicillin; clindamycin suppresses streptococcal toxin and cytokine production and observational studies suggest greater efficacy than β-lactams. Reported macrolide resistance in group A streptococci is < 5.0% in the United States, 8.2% in Germany, and 18.3% in Spain, and no resistance to clindamycin was found from invasive strains in Chicago.

### Household transmission of group A Streptococcus necrotizing fasciitis [^217eaba7]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

NF is a severe infection that requires emergent surgical intervention to prevent substantial morbidity and mortality. Nonspecific symptoms of type II NF, caused by GAS, range from localized pain to gastrointestinal symptoms, and 31% of patients are given an initial diagnosis of cellulitis. Most of these cases lack an identifiable inciting event but quickly progress to a life-threatening infection.

Group A streptococcus is highly virulent, and exposed individuals have up to 2000 times of greater risk of becoming symptomatic. Since NF can present with no obvious inciting injury or trauma, it can be mistaken for a more benign disease process, as seen with the husband's presentation. Given its ability to spread to close contacts, families with recent exposure must be properly educated about the signs and symptoms. In addition, patients should seek treatment urgently if they require increasing analgesic with new onset cellulitis to avoid delays in care. Although the mode of transmission is poorly understood, routine chemoprophylaxis for close contacts is not currently recommended unless they have substantial risk factors, such as age older than 65 years, heart disease, diabetes, and/or cancer. Our patient was not given chemoprophylaxis after the recent death of her husband because the causative organism in her husband's death was not identified until after her surgical intervention. Moreover, she did not have any risk factors.

### Therapies for necrotising fasciitis [^b9495c39]. Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy (2006). Low credibility.

Necrotising fasciitis is a rare but life-threatening infectious disease emergency. Delays in diagnosis and treatment are common, and mortality rates often exceed 30%. Successful management of this disease requires high clinical suspicion and aggressive action. The mainstays of therapy include early and wide surgical debridement, antibiotics and supportive care, with prompt surgical intervention. Adjunctive modalities, such as protein synthesis inhibitors, hyperbaric oxygen and intravenous immunoglobulin, may have a role, but their effectiveness remains unproven. New rapid diagnostic tools are emerging that promise to revolutionize early detection of necrotising fasciitis. Research into the molecular microbiology, especially regarding group A streptococcus, are providing novel insights into the pathogenesis of necrotising soft tissue infections and identifying future targets for rationally designed interventions.

### Clinical practice guideline update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America on group A streptococcal (GAS) pharyngitis [^71629256]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding classification and risk stratification for group A streptococcal pharyngitis, more specifically with respect to clinical scoring systems, IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider using a clinical scoring system, such as Centor or McIsaac, to determine which patients with sore throat should be tested for group A streptococcus.

- strongly consider testing high-risk patients even if their clinical scores are low. High-risk patients include those with sore throat who have had household exposure to group A streptococcus, such as living or sleeping in the same indoor shared space as a person diagnosed with group A streptococcus infection, a history of previous rheumatic fever diagnosis, or symptoms or signs suggestive of complicated local or systemic group A streptococcus infection, such as peritonsillar or retropharyngeal abscess, scarlet fever, and/or toxic shock syndrome

- use a clinical scoring system as part of the evaluation of patients with sore throat. The principal utility of a scoring system is to identify patients with a low probability of group A streptococcus pharyngitis, in whom further evaluation by diagnostic testing is unlikely to be helpful

- given the lack of evidence favoring any particular scoring system, clinicians and patients may favor clinical scoring systems that do not include laboratory tests

- recognize that the recommendation to use a scoring system does not apply to children under 3 years of age, as group A streptococcus infection in this age group may not present with typical clinical features represented in these scoring systems.

### Can necrotizing soft tissue infection be reliably diagnosed in the emergency department? [^331c1198]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2018). Low credibility.

Conclusion

NSTI can rapidly progress to a life-threatening septic process, unless its evolution is curtailed by aggressive surgical debridement. Key to this is prompt diagnosis which can be straightforward in typical cases where patients present with classical features, but mimics and occult disease can confuse diagnostic accuracy. Several scoring systems which can be practicably applied in the ED, have been proposed, based on laboratory indices and cross-sectional imaging, but no test is infallible. Clinicians need to exercise a high threshold for considering the diagnosis of NSTI, use scoring systems judiciously, but fundamentally, surgical exploration remains the diagnostic gold standard.

### Group G streptococcal sepsis, septic arthritis and myositis in a patient with severe oral ulcerations [^156db486]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Lancefield group G streptococci (GGS) are a relatively less common cause of streptococcal infections but the incidence of which has been reported to increase in the recent years. Similar to group A streptococci, GGS produce localised and invasive infections. Streptococcal myositis is a very rare but highly fatal infection of muscles generally caused by group A streptococci. We report a case of sepsis, migrating septic arthritis and diffuse myositis caused by β-haemolytic GGS. It is an unusual case of diffuse β-haemolytic GGS myositis involving multiple muscle groups in a patient who demonstrated no skin lesions or sign of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. The patient responded well to intravenous antibiotics without surgical intervention and experienced full recovery.

Active, Laboratory-Based Surveillance for Invasive and Severe GAS

We conducted active, laboratory-based surveillance for severe and invasive GAS infections over a 2-year period; year 1 was March 1, 2017–February 28, 2018, and year 2 was March 1, 2018–February 28, 2019. At the IHS hospital, patient specimens were collected at the discretion of the clinical provider; we then sent isolates to the Johns Hopkins Center for Indigenous Health (CIH) laboratory in Whiteriver for processing and storage. We initiated surveillance at the private facility in August 2018. We retrospectively identified all cases of severe and invasive GAS infection that occurred during March 1, 2017–July 31, 2018, through review of microbiology reports and medical charts. During August 1, 2018–February 28, 2019, we identified cases prospectively and sent isolates to the CIH laboratory. At both facilities, we obtained information on case demographics (age, sex, race), underlying medical conditions, clinical syndrome (on the basis of physician report), co-infections (identified on the hospital laboratory report), and health outcomes (amputation or death within 30 days of the initial culture) by using chart review.

We defined a case of iGAS as an American Indian patient living in a community in or near the WMA Tribal lands who had GAS isolated from a normally sterile body site (e.g. blood, cerebrospinal fluid) or from a wound with a diagnosis of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome or necrotizing soft tissue infection, including necrotizing fasciitis. We defined a case of severe GAS infection as an American Indian patient living in a community in or near the WMA Tribal lands who had GAS isolated from a nonsterile site (e.g. wound, ear) and who required hospitalization that otherwise did not meet invasive criteria. We considered patients with multiple isolates collected within 7 days of the initial culture the same case. We defined a reoccurring case as a patient with a new case event, which was GAS isolated from specimens collected > 8 days after the initial date of culture.

### Treatment… [^828da846]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Key points
- Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome is a rapidly progressing infection involving shock and multi-organ failure.
- Diagnosing STSS can be difficult and patients are often misdiagnosed.
- Treatment focuses on addressing issues with shock and specific organs that are failing.
- Treatment includes antibiotics and frequently surgery to remove the source of infection.
- Follow recommended guidelines when caring for patients with STSS. Cause STSS is a disease defined as an infection with Streptococcus pyogenes accompanied by sudden onset of shock and organ failure. S. pyogenes are also called group A Streptococcus. When the bacteria produce exotoxins and virulence factors in the deep tissues and bloodstream, it can induce a cytokine cascade. Massive cytokine cascades contribute to the development of shock or organ failure.

Strains that produce certain virulence factors and exotoxins, particularly streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins, are more likely to cause severe infections, including STSS. Keep ReadingGroup A Strep Bacteria and How They Spread Incubation period The incubation period for STSS varies depending on site of entry. Once initial symptoms occur, hypotension generally develops within 24 to 48 hours. Clinical features Initial symptoms STSS often begins with influenza-like symptoms, including:

- Chills
- Fever
- Myalgia
- Nausea
- Vomiting Disease progression These symptoms often quickly progress to sepsis with
- Hypotension
- Tachycardia
- Tachypnea
- Signs and symptoms suggestive of specific organ failure Any of the following organ systems may fail:

- Blood
- Kidney
- Liver
- Lung. Treatment Hospitalization STSS requires hospitalization. Standard treatment of shock and organ failure, such as fluid resuscitation, is imperative as the first step in treatment.

Complications Known complications of shock and organ failure can occur:

- Tissue necrosis
- Loss of extremities Mortality rates Despite aggressive treatment, the mortality rate for STSS can exceed 30%. Mortality from STSS increases with age and is substantially lower in children than adults. Clin Infect Dis. 2002; 35: 950–9. Erratum in: Clin Infect Dis. 2003; 36: 243.

### Children with lethal streptococcal fasciitis after a minor contusion injury [^1007f05f]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis is a severe life-threatening soft tissue infection characterized by rapidly spreading necrosis of the fascia and the subcutaneous tissue. Mortality as a result of streptococcal necrotizing fasciitis has been associated with the presence of hypotension, streptococcal toxic shock syndrome, or bacteremia in the literature. These infections are rare in children, and the diagnosis should be considered in the presence of any soft tissue infection presenting with signs of toxicity and marked wound edema. In addition, traumatic compartment syndrome has also gained public attention. This condition is also potentially lethal if diagnosis and management are delayed, especially in patients with swollen limbs without fracture. A high index of suspicion is most important when there is a paucity of specific cutaneous findings early in the course of the disease. The diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis should be considered for any individual who has unexplained limb pain. Even for treating patients with minor trauma, the emergency department physician should keep a high level of suspicion of the possibility of a fatal outcome from the subsequent invasive streptococcal infection.

Empiric combination therapy and multidrug-resistant pathogen risk in pediatric sepsis — In children without immune compromise and without high risk for multidrug-resistant pathogens, we suggest against the routine use of empiric multiple antimicrobials directed against the same pathogen for the purpose of synergy (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence), with remarks that in certain situations, such as confirmed or strongly suspected group B streptococcal sepsis, use of empiric multiple antimicrobials directed against the same pathogen for the purpose of synergy may be indicated. In children with immune compromise and/or at high risk for multidrug-resistant pathogens, we suggest using empiric multi-drug therapy when septic shock or other sepsis-associated organ dysfunction is present/suspected (weak recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

### Manifestations of toxic shock syndrome in children, Columbus, Ohio, USA, 2010–2017 [^279a8546]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Methods

The Nationwide Children's Hospital Institutional Review Board approved the study. We queried electronic medical records during January 2010–December 2017 for diagnosis codes from the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, for toxic shock syndrome, severe sepsis with septic shock, GAS bacteremia, and necrotizing fasciitis. The addition of diagnoses other than TSS helped us identify 7 STSS patients who were discharged with diagnoses of sepsis and septic shock. In addition to discharge and admission diagnoses, we considered any diagnosis during the hospitalization period associated with these billing codes. We also reviewed preadmission records related to the admission diagnoses. We included patients in the study if their illness met criteria for definite or probable TSS. Where all CDC criteria for either STSS or NSTSS were fulfilled, we defined cases as definite. Where a single criterion was missing because of incomplete data or because GAS was isolated from a nonsterile site, we classified the case as probable. Data collected were age, sex, height, weight, body mass index, date of presentation, and clinical signs and symptoms (Table 1). We also collected duration of hospitalization; use and type of antimicrobial agents; use and timing of clindamycin, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg), or both after initial evaluation; and clinical outcomes, including mechanical intubation, amputation, and death. We reviewed several admission laboratory and radiologic parameters: complete blood count, urinalysis, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, estimated glomerular filtration rate, alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, total bilirubin, creatinine kinase, coagulation studies, and chest radiographs. We also reviewed additional studies and any imaging study done during the hospitalization period that identified possible sites and sources of infection.

### Surviving sepsis: updated guidelines from the society of… [^066d98ad]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

- After initial resuscitation with 30 mL per kg of crystalloid fluids, further fluid resuscitation should be based on intravascular volume status and organ perfusion from dynamic measures.
- Empiric antibiotics should be started within one hour in septic shock and within three hours without shock. Empiric coverage for MRSA, gram-negative resistance, or fungal infection is recommended if these pathogens are considered likely. Resuscitation With sepsis-induced hypoperfusion or shock, resuscitation with 30 mL per kg of crystalloid fluids is recommended within the first three hours. Failing to meet this initial resuscitation guideline delays resolution of hypotension and increases intensive care duration and mortality. Although lactate levels often will not decrease to normal, levels approaching normal suggest successful resuscitation. Normalization of capillary refill time can also demonstrate resuscitation.

If vasopressors are necessary after initial fluid resuscitation, the target mean arterial pressure is 65 mm Hg because higher targets do not improve survival. Vasopressors should be started peripherally rather than waiting for central venous access. Arterial blood pressure monitoring is essential and carries low risks of limb ischemia and bleeding. Intensive care admission should be completed within six hours because mortality increases when emergency department stays exceed that time frame. Infection Control Reducing time to administration of antimicrobials reduces mortality. For patients in septic shock, antimicrobials should be started within one hour because mortality increases with each hour of delay. In sepsis without shock, the evidence is less clear, and antimicrobials are recommended within three hours of recognition.

Adding procalcitonin to clinical evaluation for antibiotic initiation does not improve mortality, length of intensive care, or hospitalization and is not recommended. Because methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus accounts for one in 20 infections in critically ill patients, empiric antimicrobial therapy should cover for MRSA in patients at high risk because delays can increase mortality. Although empiric combination antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria do not improve overall mortality, combination antibiotics are recommended for patients at high risk for multidrug-resistant organisms. Similarly, empiric antifungal agents do not improve short-term mortality in critically ill patients but are recommended for patients at high risk for invasive fungal infections.

### Infections and apparent life-threatening events [^27e5faf8]. Clinical Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

The need for routine sepsis evaluation in patients who have experienced an apparent life-threatening event but lack signs of infection remains controversial. To assess their risk of a serious occult bacterial infection, records were reviewed of 95 infants in whom infections were discovered during their inpatient evaluation after an apparent life-threatening event. Noted for each patient was the presence of any suggestive findings that would have prompted a physician to consider the given type of infection in the differential diagnosis. Thirty patients had bacterial infections; all but 5 had suggestive findings. The exceptions included 1 patient with pneumonia and 4 with urinary tract infections. None of the remaining 25 patients had occult bacterial infections. In patients with an apparent life-threatening event who appear well and lack signs suggestive of a serious bacterial infection, it may be possible to forego routine sepsis evaluation beyond a chest radiograph and urine culture without risking a serious missed diagnosis.

### Risk factors for pediatric invasive group A streptococcal disease [^43abc4f3]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

Methods

Invasive GAS disease was defined as the isolation of Streptococcus pyogenes from a normally sterile site (including blood, cerebrospinal fluid, pleural fluid, peritoneal fluid, pericardial fluid, joint fluid, surgical specimens, bone, and scrotal fluid) in a noninstitutionalized resident, < 18 years of age, in a surveillance area. Children who had GAS isolated from a sterile site > 48 hours after hospital admission were presumed to have a nosocomial infection and were excluded.

Cases of invasive GAS disease were identified through active, laboratory-based surveillance in 3 areas: metropolitan Atlanta, Georgia, from July 1, 1997, to June 30, 1999; metropolitan Baltimore, Maryland, from July 1, 1997, through June 30, 1999; and the Toronto-Peel region, Ontario, Canada, from July 1, 1997, through December 31, 1997. The surveillance area population was estimated to include 9 million people (3.6 in metropolitan Atlanta, 2.4 in metropolitan Baltimore, and 3.0 in the Toronto-Peel region based on 1997 Bureau of Census estimates). All acute-care hospitals and laboratories serving the residents of the surveillance area were contacted biweekly and audited semiannually to identify patients with invasive GAS disease. For each case of pediatric invasive GAS identified, the standardized Active Bacterial Core Surveillance case-report form was completed by reviewing the hospital medical record. This form is used for all organisms under surveillance and includes all laboratory and clinical data needed to fulfill the criteria for streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) and other clinical syndromes.

The method used to reach case-patients and identify controls has been described elsewhere. Briefly, a "case algorithm" was used to contact persons infected with invasive GAS. For each case-patient identified, up to 15 separate telephone calls were made to contact the parent or guardian. To maximize the likelihood of contacting the patient, the telephone calls were made on 5 nonconsecutive days, including at least 1 weekend day, during each of 3 different time periods (8:00 a.m.–12:00 p.m. 12:01–5:00 p.m. 5:01–8:00 p.m.). Case-patients were eligible if their enrollment was complete within 3 months of onset of GAS disease. Family members of deceased case-patients were interviewed, and non–English-speaking patients were included if individual surveillance sites had the resources to communicate with the patients in their language.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2008 [^5894d787]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the original Surviving Sepsis Campaign clinical management guidelines, "Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines for Management of Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock", published in 2004.

Design

Modified Delphi method with a consensus conference of 55 international experts, several subsequent meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. This process was conducted independently of any industry funding.

Methods

We used the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations. A strong recommendation (1) indicates that an intervention's desirable effects clearly outweigh its undesirable effects (risk, burden, cost) or clearly do not. Weak recommendations (2) indicate that the tradeoff between desirable and undesirable effects is less clear. The grade of strong or weak is considered of greater clinical importance than a difference in letter level of quality of evidence. In areas without complete agreement, a formal process of resolution was developed and applied. Recommendations are grouped into those directly targeting severe sepsis, recommendations targeting general care of the critically ill patient that are considered high priority in severe sepsis, and pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category, include early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures before antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm potential source of infection (1C); administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy within 1 hr of diagnosis of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1D); reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate (1C); a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response (1D); source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method (1C); administration of either crystalloid or colloid fluid resuscitation (1B); fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure (1C); reduction in rate of fluid administration with rising filing pressures and no improvement in tissue perfusion (1D); vasopressor preference for norepinephrine or dopamine to maintain an initial target of mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1C); dobutamine inotropic therapy when cardiac output remains low despite fluid resuscitation and combined inotropic/vasopressor therapy (1C); stress-dose steroid therapy given only in septic shock after blood pressure is identified to be poorly responsive to fluid and vasopressor therapy (2C); recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and clinical assessment of high risk for death (2B except 2C for postoperative patients). In the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage, target a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL (1B); a low tidal volume (1B) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy (1C) for acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury (1C); head of bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); avoiding routine use of pulmonary artery catheters in ALI/ARDS (1A); to decrease days of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ALI/ARDS who are not in shock (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia (1B); using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions or lightening (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible (1B); institution of glycemic control (1B), targeting a blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization (2C); equivalency of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1A); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper gastrointestinal bleeding using H2 blockers (1A) or proton pump inhibitors (1B); and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate (1D). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points (2C); dopamine as the first drug of choice for hypotension (2C); steroids only in children with suspected or proven adrenal insufficiency (2C); and a recommendation against the use of recombinant activated protein C in children (1B).

Conclusions

There was strong agreement among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best current care of patients with severe sepsis. Evidenced-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the first step toward improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome: a description of 14 cases from north yorkshire, UK [^64ad862a]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To analyze the clinical and laboratory features of patients diagnosed with streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (TSS) in North Yorkshire from 1986 to 1999.

Methods

Records of patients with features satisfying the published criteria for streptococcal TSS were reviewed from laboratory and clinical records made at the time and from the hospital case notes. Isolates of streptococci were analyzed for serotype and genes encoding for the production of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxins.

Results

Fourteen patients satisfied the entry criteria. In one district, where the data were complete, the annual incidence of detected streptococcal TSS rose from 1.1 to 9.5 cases per million population in the 1990s. TSS was associated with various M serotypes of group A streptococci and various exotoxin genotypes. Two cases (14% of the series) were associated with severe group G streptococcal infection. The fatality rate was 64%, and the mode of time to death was 4 days. Local tissue necrosis occurred in 71% of cases, including necrotizing fasciitis, intrathoracic and intra-abdominal forms. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) had been taken around the time of onset of disease by 92% of the patients with TSS.

Conclusions

There has been a dramatic increase in the number of detected cases of streptococcal TSS over the 14 years since the first case was recognized here. There was a wide range of invasive forms of infection, a high fatality rate even in fit young adults, and a rapid course from onset to death. There was a high association of TSS with aggressive streptococcal infection producing local tissue necrosis.

### Manifestations of toxic shock syndrome in children, Columbus, Ohio, USA, 2010–2017 [^d3adc7e4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Our study had several limitations. Although Nationwide Children's Hospital serves almost all of central Ohio's children, our data were not population based and were from 1 pediatric center. We might not have identified all patients with NSTSS because we were unable to review individual charts for patients with staphylococcal bacteremia if they did not have additional diagnoses of sepsis or septic shock. Despite our efforts to capture the clinical and laboratory changes at the time of initial evaluation, the duration of illness, as well as rapidly changing signs such as rash, might not have been accurately recorded in the patient charts, which would affect the overall diagnosis and possibly lead to misclassification of patients. In addition, because of the retrospective nature of our study, none of the bacterial isolates were archived for further typing or microbiological analysis.

Our findings indicate organ system involvement in TSS beyond that predicted by existing CDC criteria. Because clinicians appear to rely on archetypal presentations of TSS (e.g. fever, hypotension, and rash) to diagnose TSS, updated clinical and diagnostic criteria would facilitate early accurate diagnosis and treatment. Physicians should be aware of TSS presentations without rash. Furthermore, the updated criteria may benefit from a unifying definition.

Pediatric sepsis — definitions of antimicrobial therapy types are as follows: Empiric antimicrobial therapy is "initial antimicrobial therapy started for suspected infection in the absence of definitive microbiologic pathogen identification", and "may consist of single or multiple agents but should be broad spectrum in nature" and "should be based on local, regional, or national pathogen epidemiology and patient risk factors". Targeted/definitive antimicrobial therapy is "antimicrobial therapy targeted to specific pathogen(s), usually after microbiologic identification", and "may consist of single or multiple agents, but should not be broader than required to treat the specific pathogen(s) after microbiologic identification". Broad-spectrum antimicrobial therapy is "an antimicrobial regimen with activity against multiple different groups of bacteria or other pathogens considered to be likely causes of the clinical presentation", and "may consist of single or multiple agents". Multiple-drug antimicrobial therapy is indicated when "more than one antimicrobial agent is needed to either 1) expand the spectrum of coverage…; 2) decrease the likelihood of resistance…; or 3) provide synergy to treat a suspected or known pathogen".

### Exhaustion of the immune system by group A Streptococcus necrotizing fasciitis: the occurrence of late secondary infections in a retrospective study [^8df1c5c0]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2019). Medium credibility.

Study design

A retrospective observational multicenter study was performed in the University Medical Center Utrecht (UMCU) and St Antonius Hospital, an academic medical center and a large peripheral teaching hospital in the Netherlands, respectively. The institutional review board of both centers provided a waiver. Patients diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis from August 2002 until September 2016 in either of these centers were identified. In current literature, NSTI is defined as an infection of any of the layers within the soft tissue compartment with necrotizing changes of which necrotizing fasciitis is the most prominent infection. Patients who presented at UMCU were identified using the associated ICD-10 code (International Classification of Diseases) for necrotizing fasciitis. As no official ICD-10 code existed for the diagnosis necrotizing fasciitis in the St Antonius Hospital, patients were searched using the search terms 'NSTI', 'fasciitis necroticans/necrotizing fasciitis', Fournier's gangrene' and 'myonecrosis'. To reduce selection bias, this search was performed in multiple databases: (1) rare disease lists kept by the intensive care department, (2) the consulting system of the microbiology department, and (3) the microbiology laboratory information management system with documented positive fascia biopsies. All cases of necrotizing fasciitis from both centers were identified and data were independently collected by three researchers (FN, ECEW, FH). Patients were included if the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis (including Fournier's gangrene and myonecrosis) was confirmed by two out of three modalities: (1) macroscopic findings during surgery, (2) positive findings in the fascia fresh frozen section, and (3) positive Gram staining or tissue cultures confirmed by the medical microbiology department. Macroscopic findings indicative for necrotizing fasciitis were lack of tissue resistance, gray necrotic tissue and non-contracting muscles. Exclusion criteria were patients with a superficial infection (complex cellulitis or erysipelas) and out-of-hospital death before initial presentation at the hospital. For the occurrence of late secondary infections, pneumonia was chosen as reference infection as a result of its evident clinical presentation. Other infectious complications such as multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and bacteremia usually are already present at admission, although it is the second hit that is of interest in the present study. This simultaneous presentation of these complications with necrotizing fasciitis makes it difficult to distinguish them as a primary infection combined with necrotizing fasciitis or as secondary complication with secondary sepsis after a few days. Furthermore, it is challenging to objectively extract details on these complications and secondary infections such as surgical site infections from patient's charts. This is in contrast to the unambivalent description of pneumonia in radiology and microbiology reports, providing a suitable reference infection for late secondary infections.

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign international guidelines for the management of septic shock and sepsis-associated organ dysfunction in children [^31f6b8e9]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2020). High credibility.

Table 1. Determination of the quality of evidence — Quality ratings are based on underlying methodology, with High: systematic reviews and randomized clinical trials (RCTs); Moderate: downgraded RCTs or upgraded observational studies; Low: well-conducted prospective observational cohort studies; and Very low: downgraded observational cohort studies, case-control studies, case series or expert opinion or other evidence. Factors that may decrease strength include methodologic features of available RCTs suggesting high likelihood of bias, inconsistency of results including problems with subgroup analyses, indirectness of evidence, imprecision of results, and high likelihood of reporting bias. Factors that may increase strength include large magnitude of effect with direct evidence and relative risk > 2 with no plausible confounders, very large magnitude with relative risk > 5 and no threats to validity (by two levels), and a dose-response gradient.

### Infectious shock and toxic shock syndrome diagnoses in hospitals, Colorado, USA [^672955c4]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

First described in 1978, toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a severe febrile illness now confirmed to be caused by exotoxin-producing strains of Staphyloccocus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. Investigations based on extensive chart review and/or microbiology laboratory data suggest little or no decrease in overall TSS incidence and an increase in streptococcal TSS. Given the persistence and severity of TSS and the differences in its treatment from other causes of septic shock, its evolving epidemiology needs to be accurately monitored. To this end, we assessed International Classification of Diseases, Ninth revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM)–coded TSS cases in Colorado, USA.

### Elevation of troponin I in sepsis and septic shock [^d85dd168]. Intensive Care Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To detect myocardial damage in severe systemic inflammation by cTnI measurements in patients without acute coronary syndromes.

Design

Prospective case control study.

Setting

Tertiary referral center.

Participants

Twenty patients with sepsis, septic shock, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) were examined and compared to controls without coronary artery disease or myocarditis.

Measurements and Results

cTnI levels were assessed in patients with SIRS, sepsis, and septic shock. Eight patients (two female/six male) suffered from septic shock, nine (three female/six male) from sepsis without shock, and three (three male) from SIRS. Seventeen patients (85%) showed elevated cTnI (median 0.57 microg/l; 0.17–15.4), whereas no patient in the control group showed elevated cTnI (P < 0.0001). Six patients (30%), — three with septic shock and three with sepsis — died during hospitalization, five of them with elevated cTnI. Four out of five autopsies showed normal coronary arteries. Coronary angiography, autopsy, and stress echocardiography ruled out significant coronary artery disease in ten cTnI-positive patients (59%). In 41% of cTnI-positive patients, Streptococcus pneumoniae could be cultured, whereas no cTnI-negative or control patient showed signs of infection due to S. pneumoniae.

Conclusion

Cardiac troponin I was elevated in 85% of patients with sepsis, septic shock or SIRS in our study. A high percentage showed infection caused by S. pneumoniae. In what way microorganisms cause cTnI elevations is not yet understood.

### Toxic shock syndrome in burns: diagnosis and management [^06a594f6]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2007). Low credibility.

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS), a toxin-mediated disease, is the most common cause of unexpected mortality in children with small burns. It is a diagnosis that is often missed because of non-specific signs and an ability to mimic other childhood illnesses. Any child with a pyrexia greater than 38.9 degrees C, a rash, or a sudden change in clinical condition within a few days of a burn injury should be monitored closely for TSS. If there is co-incident hyponatraemia or lymphopaenia, or if there is any deterioration in clinical condition, the child should be managed with anti-staphylococcal and streptococcal antibiotics and passive immunity for toxins provided by fresh frozen plasma (FFP) or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). It is essential that all paediatric and emergency departments accepting children with burns are aware of the symptoms, signs and early management of TSS.

### Manifestations of toxic shock syndrome in children, Columbus, Ohio, USA, 2010–2017 [^43524bab]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a severe acute illness caused by toxin-producing strains of Streptococcus pyogenes (streptococcal TSS [STSS]) and Staphylococcus aureus (nonstreptococcal TSS [NSTSS]). Data are limited on the incidence, management, and outcomes for children with TSS. Most epidemiologic and clinical studies of TSS have reported predominantly streptococcal cases. The incidence of severe streptococcal infections, including TSS, has been increasing in North America since the 1990s. Studies from the United States and Canada report incidence rates of 3.8–10.24 invasive group A Streptococcus (GAS) cases per 100,000 persons per year. Reported death rates vary from 4.2% to 56% for STSS (,–) and are up to 22% for NSTSS.

The uncontrolled cytokine stimulation by bacterial toxins results in several clinical manifestations of TSS, such as hypotension, fever, rash, and organ dysfunction. On the basis of these clinical signs, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defined criteria for TSS and updated these criteria in 2010 for STSS and in 2011 for NSTSS. Despite recognition of illness and CDC disease definitions, TSS diagnosis remains challenging because some clinical findings, such as hypotension, could be transient and some, such as rash, might be absent.

CDC criteria do not differentiate between children and adults. In children, differentiating TSS from septic shock, Kawasaki disease with shock, and drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome poses additional challenges. In addition to these diagnostic difficulties, challenges and controversies exist for managing TSS. Our objective was to differentiate the clinical patterns of TSS in children in a large tertiary center as they relate to published criteria, diagnostic decisions, and treatment options.

### Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome after breast reconstruction [^2da4ec9f]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) is an increasingly common disease entity but has rarely been described in the plastic surgery literature. We present the first known case of STSS associated with a reconstructive procedure. Two weeks postoperatively from a transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous flap for breast reconstruction, our patient presented with flulike symptoms and progressed rapidly to multiorgan failure. Though initially no nidus for infection was evident, the abdominal donor site was surgically debrided and found to contain group A Streptococcus. Following aggressive rehydration and antibiotic therapy, the patient gradually made a full recovery. In this case report, we review the presentation and epidemiology of STSS and compare it to the more common staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome. In addition, we discuss the management and outcomes of STSS, with an emphasis on raising clinical suspicion for this rare but dangerous entity.

### Reply to arends and harkisoen [^fc806044]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

 — We thank Arends and Harkisoen for their thoughtful comments relating to our article on the efficacy of polyspecific intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS). As detailed in our article, 75 STSS patients were identified through a national Swedish active surveillance study of invasive group A streptococcal (GAS) infections, in which a total of 746 invasive cases were included. The study was designed to focus entirely on STSS cases and not on the heterogeneous group of patients with invasive (GAS) infections, the rationale being that IVIG has been suggested as adjunctive therapy in STSS with a beneficial effect on survival in these patients with pronounced systemic toxicity. The mortality often exceeds 40% in STSS cases compared with < 15% for invasive cases. Among the 746 invasive GAS cases, 26 patients in total received IVIG, and as expected, the vast majority had an STSS diagnosis (n = 23).

### Surviving Sepsis Campaign: international guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock: 2008 [^1fedd28a]. Intensive Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To provide an update to the original Surviving Sepsis Campaign clinical management guidelines, "Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock", published in 2004.

Design

Modified Delphi method with a consensus conference of 55 international experts, several subsequent meetings of subgroups and key individuals, teleconferences, and electronic-based discussion among subgroups and among the entire committee. This process was conducted independently of any industry funding.

Methods

We used the GRADE system to guide assessment of quality of evidence from high (A) to very low (D) and to determine the strength of recommendations. A strong recommendation indicates that an intervention's desirable effects clearly outweigh its undesirable effects (risk, burden, cost), or clearly do not. Weak recommendations indicate that the tradeoff between desirable and undesirable effects is less clear. The grade of strong or weak is considered of greater clinical importance than a difference in letter level of quality of evidence. In areas without complete agreement, a formal process of resolution was developed and applied. Recommendations are grouped into those directly targeting severe sepsis, recommendations targeting general care of the critically ill patient that are considered high priority in severe sepsis, and pediatric considerations.

Results

Key recommendations, listed by category, include: early goal-directed resuscitation of the septic patient during the first 6 hrs after recognition (1C); blood cultures prior to antibiotic therapy (1C); imaging studies performed promptly to confirm potential source of infection (1C); administration of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy within 1 hr of diagnosis of septic shock (1B) and severe sepsis without septic shock (1D); reassessment of antibiotic therapy with microbiology and clinical data to narrow coverage, when appropriate (1C); a usual 7–10 days of antibiotic therapy guided by clinical response (1D); source control with attention to the balance of risks and benefits of the chosen method (1C); administration of either crystalloid or colloid fluid resuscitation (1B); fluid challenge to restore mean circulating filling pressure (1C); reduction in rate of fluid administration with rising filing pressures and no improvement in tissue perfusion (1D); vasopressor preference for norepinephrine or dopamine to maintain an initial target of mean arterial pressure ≥ 65 mm Hg (1C); dobutamine inotropic therapy when cardiac output remains low despite fluid resuscitation and combined inotropic/vasopressor therapy (1C); stress-dose steroid therapy given only in septic shock after blood pressure is identified to be poorly responsive to fluid and vasopressor therapy (2C); recombinant activated protein C in patients with severe sepsis and clinical assessment of high risk for death (2B except 2C for post-operative patients). In the absence of tissue hypoperfusion, coronary artery disease, or acute hemorrhage, target a hemoglobin of 7–9 g/dL (1B); a low tidal volume (1B) and limitation of inspiratory plateau pressure strategy (1C) for acute lung injury (ALI)/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); application of at least a minimal amount of positive end-expiratory pressure in acute lung injury (1C); head of bed elevation in mechanically ventilated patients unless contraindicated (1B); avoiding routine use of pulmonary artery catheters in ALI/ARDS (1A); to decrease days of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay, a conservative fluid strategy for patients with established ALI/ARDS who are not in shock (1C); protocols for weaning and sedation/analgesia (1B); using either intermittent bolus sedation or continuous infusion sedation with daily interruptions or lightening (1B); avoidance of neuromuscular blockers, if at all possible (1B); institution of glycemic control (1B) targeting a blood glucose < 150 mg/dL after initial stabilization (2C); equivalency of continuous veno-veno hemofiltration or intermittent hemodialysis (2B); prophylaxis for deep vein thrombosis (1A); use of stress ulcer prophylaxis to prevent upper GI bleeding using H2 blockers (1A) or proton pump inhibitors (1B); and consideration of limitation of support where appropriate (1D). Recommendations specific to pediatric severe sepsis include: greater use of physical examination therapeutic end points (2C); dopamine as the first drug of choice for hypotension (2C); steroids only in children with suspected or proven adrenal insufficiency (2C); a recommendation against the use of recombinant activated protein C in children (1B).

Conclusion

There was strong agreement among a large cohort of international experts regarding many level 1 recommendations for the best current care of patients with severe sepsis. Evidenced-based recommendations regarding the acute management of sepsis and septic shock are the first step toward improved outcomes for this important group of critically ill patients.

### Epidemiology and costs of sepsis in the United States-An analysis based on timing of diagnosis and severity level [^3db8b55f]. Critical Care Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Analysis

The primary analysis addressed all sepsis-related cases. We also examined the data by whether the sepsis diagnosis was present at admission (POA). Identification of POA diagnoses are part of a requirement of the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) Deficit Reduction Act for diseases which are high in cost or volume, assigned to higher paying DRGs and reasonably preventable through evidence-based medicine. Unfortunately, CMS does not require POA diagnoses at admission to be later verified; therefore, those in the non-POA group could have disease that was acquired later in the admission or was missed on initial assessment.

Patients were evaluated from the time of their admission until discharge. Clinical features of interest included demographics, outcomes, and costs. Outcomes were further stratified by the index admission and any readmissions within 30 days of discharge. During the index admission, outcomes evaluated included LOS, ICU time, time on a mechanical ventilator, inpatient mortality, discharge status (to home, skilled nursing facility, etc), and cost of visit. Additionally, 30-day follow-up outcomes included all-cause readmissions and readmission cost.

The secondary analysis focused on better characterizing the economic burden of sepsis by severity level. A hierarchy of ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes was created to stratify patients into severity categories. Those with septic shock codes were classified septic shock, those with severe sepsis codes but no septic shock codes were classified as severe sepsis, those with sepsis codes but no severe sepsis or septic shock codes were classified as sepsis without organ dysfunction, and everyone else was classified as other (Table 1).

Data were measured on a continuous scale and analyzed as mean, and median. Categorical data are reported as counts and percentages. Index hospitalization cost, defined as the cost incurred by the hospital to treat the patient, is reported in total. All analyses were conducted with SAS (version 9.4, SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC).

### Necrotizing fasciitis [^eb69ebcd]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2011). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rare, rapidly progressive bacterial soft tissue infection with a high risk for morbidity and mortality. Although more common in adults, NF also affects the pediatric population. Many bacterial organisms can cause NF, but group A Streptococcus is the most common monomicrobial cause of disease. Necrotizing fasciitis remains principally a clinical diagnosis, and it is often missed early in its presentation because of the difficulty in differentiating it from more common soft tissue infections. The criterion standard for diagnosis and the mainstay of therapy are surgical debridement. Time to initiation and completion of therapy remains the most important factor in patient outcome, highlighting the importance of early recognition and intervention in this potentially devastating disease.

### Practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of skin and soft tissue infections: 2014 update by the Infectious Diseases Society of America [^0cca2533]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Medium credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis — definition, clinical features, and bacteriology are detailed. Necrotizing fasciitis is "an aggressive subcutaneous infection that tracks along the superficial fascia", and "it is the superficial fascia that is most commonly involved". The initial presentation "is that of cellulitis", progressing with "systemic toxicity, often including high temperatures, disorientation, and lethargy", and a distinguishing feature is "the wooden-hard induration of the subcutaneous tissues". In the monomicrobial form, pathogens "are S. pyogenes, S. aureus, V. vulnificus, A. hydrophila, and anaerobic streptococci (Peptostreptococcus)", with most infections "community acquired and present in the limbs, with approximately two-thirds in the lower extremities". Cases after varicella or trivial injuries are "usually due to S. pyogenes", and in group A streptococcal disease with hypotension and organ failure, mortality is "ranging from 30% to 70%". Among S. pyogenes cases, "Nearly 50%" have "no portal of entry" and instead develop deep infection at a site of nonpenetrating trauma. Polymicrobial infection is "most commonly associated with 4 clinical settings" including perianal/abdominal sources, decubitus ulcers, injection sites in illicit drug users, and spread from genital sites.

### Photo quiz: unexpected pathogens in the Gram staining of a blood culture smear [^d465d102]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Medium credibility.

PHOTO QUIZ

A 57-year-old woman with known arterial hypertension consulted her general practitioner because of malaise and fever of undetermined character and duration. She was empirically treated with oral amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. One week later, she was admitted to the hospital and transferred to the intensive care unit due to impaired consciousness, shock (lactate 7.9 mmol/L), fever, leukocytosis (leukocytes 23.22 /nL), elevated inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein 231.9 mg/L, procalcitonin 150.4 µg/L), anemia (hemoglobin 86 g/L), thrombocytopenia (platelets 128 /nL), acute renal dysfunction (serum creatinine 41.6 mg/L), and acute liver failure. The patient was intubated, and mechanical ventilation and continuous renal replacement were started. Due to continuous veno-venous hemodialysis, also aiming for normothermic temperature management, no statements can be made about the course of the fever while being treated in the intensive care unit. Computed tomography of the head did not show any pathological findings. Blood cultures were sampled as part of standard microbiology diagnostics. After 3 h and 13 min of incubation, the aerobic blood culture bottle signaled growth (BD BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F blood culture bottle; BACTEC FX blood culture system, Becton Dickinson GmbH, Germany), and the Gram stain of a blood culture smear revealed numerous circular pathogens (Fig. 1A). Despite prompt treatment and maximal intensive care, multi-organ failure progressed, and the patient died within 1 day.

### Going out on a limb: Do not delay diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis in varicella infection [^446a2117]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2015). Low credibility.

Necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is a rare complication of varicella zoster (chicken pox) infection. Its diagnosis can be delayed or missed, which increases mortality and morbidity, because it initially presents similarly to cellulitis. We present the case of a 5-year-old boy who presented with a swollen leg, the difficulties in the diagnosis of NF, and a review of the literature. Necrotizing fasciitis complicating varicella zoster in children is associated with 3.4% mortality, although this rises to 13.6% in streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. Seventy-one percent of cases are confirmed as being caused by group A β-hemolytic Streptococcus. The association of NF with chicken pox is discussed along with the difficulties in diagnosis and treatment options. Necrotizing fasciitis is a surgical emergency and should be considered by all emergency department acute care practitioners in cases of varicella in which fever is enduring and swelling or pain is disproportionate. Because of the difficulty in diagnosis, senior opinion should be sought early.

### Molecular analysis of an outbreak of lethal postpartum sepsis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes [^fff69ad6]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2013). Low credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Cases of postpartum maternalsepsis occur sporadically; paired cases and deaths are rare in the developed world. We describe two postpartum deaths due to(group A[GAS]) that occurred within 24 h in the same maternity unit; one case was characterized by septic shock and the other by hemorrhagic pneumonia. Both cases were associated with seven additional infections detected in health care and family contacts. We combined genotypic and phenotypic analyses with whole-genome sequencing to confirm that the isolates were unique and distinct from other emm 1 GAS isolates circulating in the United Kingdom, enabling us to determine the time limits and scale of this outbreak.

### Sepsis: diagnosis and management… [^c3910a51]. AAFP (2020). Medium credibility.

WHAT'S NEW ON THIS TOPIC Sepsis 2016 guidelines provide a new definition for sepsis: a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. The guidelines define septic shock as sepsis with circulatory, cellular, and metabolic dysfunction that is associated with a higher risk of mortality; the presence of hypotension is no longer required. Although an increasing number of patients admitted for sepsis become well enough to be discharged from the hospital, these patients have higher rates of readmission and of death within 12 months and significantly reduced physical and cognitive function compared with matched controls.
7. 8, 9 The terminology was simplified, and sepsis and septic shock are now the only recognized terms. 8, 9 Sepsis is now defined as a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection.

Septic shock is defined as sepsis with circulatory, cellular, and metabolic dysfunction that is associated with a higher risk of mortality. After initial airway and respiratory stabilization, patients with sepsis should complete the sepsis bundle within three hours of presentation. 24–27 Vasopressor therapy is initiated if the patient is hypotensive despite fluid resuscitation. 21, 28, 29 Infection source control with early surgical consultation should be obtained for suspected infections requiring operative or other interventional treatment. Treatment FLUID RESUSCITATION The priorities in early sepsis management are establishing vascular access and initiating fluid resuscitation. Patients with sepsis should receive an intravenous crystalloid at 30 mL per kg within the first three hours.

Crystalloid formulations are unbalanced or balanced. Large-volume resuscitation with an unbalanced crystalloid can result in hyperchloremic acidosis, coagulopathy, and acute kidney injury. 49 Fluid administration should be restricted in the latter phases of sepsis management. At 72 hours, the net fluid balance goal should be close to zero or slightly negative. Each 1-L increase in net positive balance at 72 hours is associated with increased risk of death.
