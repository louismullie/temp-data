## Question

Albumin to globulin ratio

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the albumin-to-globulin ratio (AGR), including its definition, physiology, prognostic value across diseases, thresholds, limitations, and practical clinical use. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining AGR and its physiological basis. Then, I should appraise the evidence base by disease context and study quality. Next, I will extract and validate commonly used thresholds. After that, I need to examine limitations and confounders. Finally, I will synthesize practical clinical guidance and highlight knowledge gaps that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the definition and physiology. AGR is simply serum albumin divided by serum globulin, where globulin is typically calculated as total protein minus albumin; albumin is a negative acute-phase reactant synthesized by the liver and contributes most of the plasma colloid oncotic pressure, while globulins include immunoglobulins and acute-phase proteins that rise with inflammation, so AGR integrates nutrition and inflammation signals in one metric [^f63f7bd9] [^82bd5988] [^12988461].

> Wait, let me verify the prognostic signal in oncology. Large longitudinal cohorts in colorectal, NSCLC, and HCC show that both preoperative and postoperative AGR independently predict overall survival, with L-shaped relationships and worse outcomes when AGR is low; trajectory groups over 12 months after surgery further stratify risk, with the decreasing-rising pattern carrying the highest hazard, supporting serial AGR monitoring in postoperative surveillance [^e2f65db2] [^935a1a9e] [^73cddab5].

> I should confirm disease-specific thresholds. In upper tract urothelial carcinoma, multiple studies converge on AGR less than 1.25 as an independent predictor of worse cancer-specific and overall survival after radical nephroureterectomy, and this cutoff is consistently reproduced across cohorts and multivariable models [^5986ad2f] [^5420c5f0] [^83c550aa]. In advanced NSCLC treated with anlotinib, a nonlinear relationship shows an inflection around 1.24, with markedly lower mortality risk when AGR exceeds that value, suggesting a pragmatic threshold in that therapeutic context [^4038046a]. In peritoneal dialysis, AGR greater than 1.26 associates with better survival, again pointing to roughly 1.25 as a clinically meaningful boundary in ESRD populations [^a2eae1dd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about universal cutoffs. I need to check non-oncologic contexts. In incident hemodialysis, an A:G ratio less than 0.75 independently predicts higher all-cause mortality, indicating that very low AGR values carry risk even after adjustment for malnutrition and inflammation, though this threshold is lower than in oncology cohorts and likely reflects different baseline protein patterns in ESRD [^c6bb2e53]. In inflammatory bowel disease, elevated globulin fraction itself tracks with hospitalizations and surgeries, reinforcing that the globulin component of AGR captures disease activity and long-term severity, even if AGR itself is not always reported [^fb324c5a] [^9ead337f].

> Let me consider muscle mass and frailty, because AGR might index sarcopenia risk. In NHANES, AGR shows a positive association with appendicular skeletal muscle mass in men, with a threshold effect around AGR 1.4, suggesting potential utility for identifying low muscle mass in older adults, though sex-specific patterns and confounding by comorbidity require caution in interpretation [^67e5d2b2] [^63b94371]. But wait, what if albumin and globulin are independently associated with muscle in opposite directions? Indeed, albumin correlates positively and globulin negatively with muscle mass in men, which mechanistically aligns with inflammation-driven catabolism and supports AGR as a composite marker in this domain [^4d958f3b].

> I should double-check limitations and confounders before recommending routine use. AGR is a composite of two analytes, so changes in either albumin or globulin can shift the ratio; dehydration can artifactually raise albumin and AGR, while overhydration or third spacing can lower albumin and AGR, and assay variability for albumin and total protein can propagate error into AGR, especially across laboratories [^notfound]. Moreover, AGR does not distinguish monoclonal from polyclonal gammopathies; when globulin is high, I should confirm with serum protein electrophoresis to avoid missing myeloma or related disorders, and I must remember that AGR is a marker, not a mediator, so correcting AGR per se may not change outcomes unless the underlying driver is treated [^152777ac] [^a5ee7c91].

> Next, I should review how AGR compares with other inflammation-nutrition biomarkers. CRP-to-albumin ratio (CAR) and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) are frequently studied alongside AGR; in decompensated cirrhosis, CAR has shown independent prognostic value, whereas gamma globulins alone may not outperform MELD or CTP, underscoring that no single marker universally supersedes established clinical scores and that AGR should be interpreted in disease-specific contexts [^3261318d] [^193cc432]. In periprosthetic joint infection, CAR and CAGR outperform AGR diagnostically, reminding me not to overgeneralize AGR's performance across indications [^38b35538].

> Let me synthesize practical clinical guidance. First, I should confirm that AGR is calculated correctly from a reliable lab using standardized methods, and I should interpret AGR alongside total protein, albumin, and clinical context rather than in isolation. Second, in oncology, especially GI and lung cancers, AGR less than about 1.25 should prompt closer staging, consideration of perioperative risk, and consideration of serial AGR monitoring during follow-up given the prognostic gradient across trajectory groups. Third, in ESRD, AGR less than about 1.25 identifies higher mortality risk and may inform counseling and risk stratification. Fourth, in older adults, particularly men, AGR around 1.4 may flag low muscle mass and support geriatric assessment, though causality is not established. Fifth, when globulin is elevated, I should order serum protein electrophoresis to exclude monoclonal gammopathies before attributing changes to inflammation alone [^e2f65db2] [^a2eae1dd] [^67e5d2b2] [^152777ac].

> I need to ensure I flag what would change practice. Prospective, interventional trials are needed to test whether targeting AGR improvement changes outcomes, and harmonization of albumin and total protein assays with traceable reference materials would reduce analytical noise and improve comparability across studies and centers. Until then, AGR should remain an adjunctive marker integrated with disease-specific prognostic models and clinical judgment rather than a standalone decision tool [^40285a37] [^7f9f6d76].

The albumin-to-globulin ratio (AGR) is a **simple, inexpensive, and widely available** laboratory parameter that integrates nutritional and inflammatory status. It is calculated as serum albumin divided by globulin (total protein minus albumin) [^12988461]. AGR is a **strong independent predictor of outcomes** across multiple conditions, including cancer, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, and critical illness, with lower AGR consistently associated with higher mortality and morbidity [^e2f65db2] [^a2eae1dd] [^c6bb2e53] [^0ec23fdf]. Typical reference ranges are 1.0–2.2, but disease-specific thresholds (often around 1.25) are more prognostically informative than fixed cutoffs [^5986ad2f] [^5420c5f0]. AGR is most useful when interpreted in clinical context and, when available, as serial trends rather than a single value [^e2f65db2].

---

## Physiological basis and clinical significance

Albumin is a **negative acute-phase reactant** synthesized by the liver; its levels fall with inflammation, malnutrition, or liver disease, and it contributes most of the plasma oncotic pressure [^f63f7bd9]. Globulins include immunoglobulins and acute-phase proteins that rise with inflammation and immune activation; thus, AGR reflects both nutrition and inflammation [^4d958f3b]. Because AGR integrates these signals, it often outperforms albumin or globulin alone for prognostication [^85bf89ed].

---

## Calculation and reference ranges

AGR is calculated as **albumin divided by (total protein − albumin)** [^12988461]. Typical adult reference ranges are 1.0–2.2, but optimal prognostic thresholds vary by disease and population, so disease-specific cutoffs should be used when available [^5986ad2f].

---

## Clinical applications and prognostic value

AGR has prognostic value across diverse clinical scenarios:

| **Clinical condition** | **Prognostic significance** | **Key findings** |
|-|-|-|
| Cancer (colorectal, NSCLC, HCC) | Lower preoperative AGR predicts worse OS/RFS; postoperative AGR trajectories further stratify risk [^e2f65db2] [^935a1a9e] | - 5-year OS: 82.4% (normal AGR) vs 72.9% (low AGR) <br/> - Adjusted HRs for unfavorable trajectories: 1.38–2.78 [^935a1a9e] |
| Upper tract urothelial carcinoma | Preoperative AGR < 1.25 independently predicts worse CSS/OS [^5986ad2f] [^5420c5f0] | HR 2.81 for CSS; HR 2.09 for OS [^5986ad2f] |
| Advanced NSCLC (anlotinib) | Nonlinear relationship with OS; AGR > 1.24 is protective [^4038046a] | HR 0.20 for AGR > 1.24 [^4038046a] |
| Peritoneal dialysis | Lower AGR associates with higher all-cause and cardiovascular mortality [^a2eae1dd] [^7d2488a7] | HR 1.57 for all-cause; HR 2.01 for CVD mortality [^a2eae1dd] |
| Hemodialysis | A:G ratio < 0.75 predicts higher all-cause mortality [^c6bb2e53] | HR 1.45 [^c6bb2e53] |
| Critical illness | Hypoalbuminemia (low AGR) correlates with higher mortality, complications, and longer stay [^0ec23fdf] [^4a5562a7] | Each 10 g/L albumin drop: 137% higher mortality odds [^0ec23fdf] |

## Factors influencing AGR

Several factors can **alter AGR**:

- **Inflammation**: Cytokines suppress albumin synthesis and increase globulins, lowering AGR [^0ac5c49a].
- **Nutritional status**: Malnutrition reduces albumin, lowering AGR [^notfound].
- **Liver disease**: Reduced albumin synthesis and altered globulin patterns affect AGR [^a5ee7c91].
- **Renal disease**: Proteinuria and altered protein metabolism can change AGR [^notfound].
- **Hydration status**: Hemoconcentration or hemodilution can artifactually alter AGR.

---

## Limitations and considerations

While useful, AGR has limitations: it is a **nonspecific marker** influenced by multiple factors, and disease-specific thresholds vary, so results must be interpreted in clinical context. Assay variability for albumin and total protein can affect AGR, and standardization is important [^40285a37]. AGR should complement, not replace, other clinical and laboratory assessments.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

There are **no universal guidelines** for routine AGR use; however, emerging evidence supports its prognostic utility in oncology, nephrology, and critical care. Clinicians should consider AGR when available, especially in risk stratification and longitudinal monitoring, and use disease-specific thresholds when supported by evidence [^e2f65db2] [^a2eae1dd].

---

## Future directions and research needs

Future work should define **disease-specific AGR thresholds** and standardize assays to improve comparability. Prospective studies should test whether targeting AGR improvement improves outcomes, and research should integrate AGR with other biomarkers to enhance prognostic accuracy.

---

The albumin-to-globulin ratio is a **practical, prognostically meaningful marker** that reflects nutrition and inflammation. It is most powerful when interpreted in disease-specific contexts and as serial trends, and it can guide risk stratification and monitoring across oncology, nephrology, hepatology, and critical care.

Previous studies on serum albumin-to-globulin ratio (AGR) in human cancers were limited to its preoperative level, with postoperative serial AGR remeasurements ignored. In this study, 2844 CRC patients, 2267 NSCLC patients and 507 HCC patients who underwent curative resection were included. Postoperative AGR was a prognostic factor independent to preoperative AGR, performing a L shaped relation with OS. The 5-year OS rates for the persistently normal, normalized, lowered and persistently low perioperative AGR groups were 84.0%, 80.7%, 78.5% and 70.2%. Three longitudinal AGR trajectory groups were identified within 12 months after surgery. Compared with the normal-stable group, the adjusted HRs on OS for the rising-decreasing and decreasing-rising groups were 1.38 (95% CI: 1.13–1.68, P = 0.001) and 2.78 (95% CI: 2.30–3.36, P < 0.001). Similar results were observed for RFS. In conclusion, a routine follow-up of AGR in the postoperative surveillance will improve prognosis risk stratification of cancer patients.

Introduction

Chronic inflammation and malnutrition play important roles in muscle loss. Although albumin, globulin and albumin to globulin ratio (AGR) are considered to be useful inflammatory-nutritional biomarkers, their relationship with muscle mass remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between them in adults.

Methods

We utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011–2014 for analysis. Data on albumin, globulin, appendicular skeletal muscle mass, body mass index (BMI) and potential confounders (sociodemographic characteristics, medical conditions, laboratory parameters) were extracted and analyzed. We conducted multivariate linear regression models and smooth curve fittings to investigate the association between albumin, globulin, AGR and muscle mass. Subgroup analysis based on gender and muscle mass were performed.

Results

A total of 4110 participants were included, there were 294 participants with low muscle mass (LMM) and 3816 participants with normal muscle mass (NMM). LMM individuals were older, had greater prevalence of diabetes, higher BMI, globulin and triglycerides, lower albumin and AGR. Albumin was positively correlated to muscle mass in men, but negatively correlated with muscle mass in women. There were negative association between globulin and muscle mass, and positive association between AGR and muscle mass among men, but no significant associations were detected among women. Moreover, a linear relationship between albumin, globulin and muscle mass, as well as a non-linear relationship between AGR and muscle mass in men were identified.

Conclusions

The relationships between albumin, globulin, AGR and muscle mass were sex-specific. We speculate these indicators may be useful in assessing muscle mass in men.

Study variables

Muscle mass

The body composition measurements were performed using whole-body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) exams (Hologic, Inc. Bedford, Massachusetts), which provided values for total and regional bone mineral content, fat mass and lean soft tissue mass. ASM was defined as the sum of the lean soft tissue mass of both arms and legs. BMI was obtained from body measures. We further quantified muscle mass using appendicular skeletal muscle index (ASMI), calculated as the ratio of ASM and BMI. Based on the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health recommendation, LMM was defined as ASMI < 0.789 for men and ASMI < 0.512 for women.

Serum albumin, globulin and AGR

The serum albumin (g/dL) and serum globulin (g/dL) were measured using a Beckman UniCel® DxC800 Synchron instrument. The AGR was calculated as the albumin divided by the globulin.

Other covariates

The selection of confounding factors was based on literatures, and the following variables were considered as covariates. Demographic variables, including age (years), gender (man or woman), race (Hispanic, Non-Hispanic White, Non-Hispanic Black, others) were obtained from demographic data. The presence or absence of hypertension and diabetes were defined by participants' self-report of the diagnosis by a doctor. The serum total calcium (mg/dL), phosphorus (mg/dL), triglycerides (mg/dL) and uric acid (mg/dL) were measured using a Beckman UniCel® DxC800 Synchron instrument. White blood cell counts (1000 cells/uL) and Hemoglobin (g/dL) were measured using the Beckman Coulter MAXM instrument. The serum 25(OH)D (nmol/L) was quantified using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS). The total cholesterol (mg/dL) in serum was determined using Roche/Hitachi Modular P Chemistry Analyzer. (A summary of the reference range of laboratory parameters is demonstrated in Supplemental Table 1). A detailed description of the laboratory methodology, quality-control and quality-assurance protocols can be found on the NHANES website.

The associations of preoperative and postoperative AGR with prognosis

L-shaped relation between the preoperative AGR and OS was observed, which reduced substantially within the lower range of preoperative AGR and remained relatively flat thereafter (Fig. 2a). Preoperative AGR was normal in 3793 patients and low in 1508 patients, with median [IQR] preoperative AGR levels of 1.8 [1.6, 2.0] and 1.4 [1.2, 1.4]. Patients with low preoperative AGR had a greater age and pathological stage than those with normal preoperative AGR (Supplementary Table 5). The 5-year OS rates were 82.4% (95% CI: 81.2–83.7%) and 72.9% (95% CI: 70.5–75.3%) in patients with normal and low preoperative AGR, with a log-rank P < 0.001. (Fig. 2b).

The associations of perioperative AGR changing patterns with prognosis

The risk of death increased with the decrease of postoperative AGR levels in patients with both normal and low preoperative AGR, and the slope of reduction was steeper in patients with low preoperative AGR than those with normal preoperative AGR (Fig. 3 a, b). Of 5186 patients with accessible preoperative and postoperative AGR, four perioperative AGR groups were identified: the persistently normal group (n = 2663), the normalized group (n = 392), and the lowered group (n = 1096), and the persistently low group (n = 1035). Compared with patients with persistently normal perioperative AGR, patients in the other three groups had more pathological factors associated with poor prognosis (Supplementary Table 7).

### Relationship between albumin-globulin ratio and prostate-specific antigen: a cross-sectional study based on NHANES 2003–2010 [^0ac5c49a]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

The mechanisms associated with low AGR levels and tumor development are unclear. Some studies have pointed out that serum albumin and globulin respond to the body's nutritional and immune-inflammatory status respectively. The albumin-to-globulin ratio is more reflective of the physiologic and pathologic state of the body. Albumin is closely related to the globulin level. When the body is in an inflammatory state, cytokines associated with the inflammatory response inhibit albumin synthesis. At the same time, inflammation can cause changes in the permeability of blood vessels, and serum albumin can then leak through blood vessels into the intercellular matrix, resulting in lower levels. Moreover, research findings indicate that the serum albumin level serves as an indicator of inflammation severity. When immune cells become activated as a result of inflammation, they generate an increased quantity of cytokines, consequently causing a transition in the liver's protein synthesis from the production of albumin towards that of other acute-phase proteins. In addition to this, the chronic inflammatory state is thought to produce an inflammatory microenvironment that predisposes individuals to cancers, and inflammatory substances secreted by cells in such an inflammatory microenvironment can induce cancer cell proliferation as well as survival, thereby promoting cancer metastasis and angiogenesis. The specific mechanism still needs to be verified by a large number of basic experiments.

Discussion

Various factors have been suggested to involve in the occurrence and development of muscle loss, chronic low-grade inflammation and malnutrition were considered to be important causative factors. Although several elevated inflammatory factors have been identified in LMM individuals, a biomarker with a clear link to muscle mass measurement is still lacking. The results of our study demonstrated a significantly higher serum globulin, and lower serum albumin and AGR in LMM individuals. Furthermore, albumin and AGR were positively correlated with muscle mass, globulin was negatively correlated with muscle mass in men.

There is a growing awareness that even health ageing cannot avoid an elevated inflammatory status, which is considered to be related with muscle loss and function impairment. Several elevated inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), have been identified in patients with poor muscle strength and muscle mass. Serum globulin contains various proteins involving in inflammatory responses, such as complements, immunoglobulins, and acute phase response proteins, which has been recognized as a reliable indicator for inflammatory state. However, the relationship between globulin and muscle mass has long been disregarded. Our study not only found a higher globulin level in individuals with LMM, but also identified a negative association between globulin and muscle mass in men. This finding further corroborated the role of inflammation in muscle loss.

### KDIGO 2024 clinical practice guideline for the evaluation and management of chronic kidney disease [^f77e1997]. Kidney International (2024). High credibility.

KDIGO 2024 chronic kidney disease — urine albumin versus total protein measurement notes limitations and variability. It is possible that replacing urinary total protein measurement with albumin measurement may cause nonalbuminuric (effectively tubular and overproduction) proteinuria to be missed, and the significance of this issue is thought to be low in adults. In health, relatively small amounts of albumin (< 30 mg/24 hours) are lost in the urine. Total protein measurement is problematic in urine due to imprecision and insensitivity at low concentrations, most laboratories currently use either turbidimetry or colorimetry to measure total protein, and these methods do not give equal analytical specificity and sensitivity for all proteins, with a tendency to react more strongly with albumin than with globulin and other non-albumin proteins, and many have significant interferences causing falsely high results. There is no reference measurement procedure and no standardized reference material for urinary total protein measurement, and the variety of methods and calibrants in use means that there is inevitably significant between-laboratory variation.

### Albumin administration in the acutely ill: what is new and where next? [^4a5562a7]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Hypoalbuminemia

Hypoalbuminemia (generally defined as a serum albumin concentration ≤ 30 g/l) is very common in critically ill patients, the main reasons probably being increased albumin losses from bleeding and via the gastrointestinal tract, increased capillary permeability leading to a redistribution from the intravascular to the interstitial space (previously called third-spacing), and dilution from intravenous fluid administration Moreover, in some patients – particularly older patients – baseline albumin levels may already be low as a result of poor nutritional status or altered liver function. Although animal models suggested that albumin synthesis may be reduced in critical illness, synthesis appears to be increased in critically ill humans.

Importantly, whatever the underlying mechanisms, hypoalbuminemia is associated with worse outcomes including increased complications and reduced short-term and longer-term survival in critically ill patients. In a meta-analysis of 90 cohort studies that had evaluated hypoalbuminemia as a prognostic biomarker in acutely ill patients, each 10 g/l decrease in serum albumin concentration was associated with a 137% increase in the odds of death, an 89% increase in morbidity, and a 71% increase in length of hospital stay. There is therefore a clear association between the albumin level and the severity of the insult, but it remains uncertain whether the effect of hypoalbuminemia on outcome is a cause–effect relationship or whether hypoalbuminemia is rather a marker of serious disease.

### Relationship between albumin-globulin ratio and prostate-specific antigen: a cross-sectional study based on NHANES 2003–2010 [^1b9fe1b2]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prostate cancer is expected to be the second most common type of cancer and the fifth largest cause of cancer-related mortality among males by 2020, according to the World Cancer Statistics. Almost all reputable clinical guidelines from the past few decades have suggested using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to identify prostate cancer. However, PSA is characterized by its high sensitivity and low specificity, which often lead to diagnostic biases. Many factors are known to affect the PSA level, such as age, prostatitis, certain medications and prostate size.

The albumin-globulin ratio (AGR), as everyone knows, is calculated by dividing the serum albumin count by the globulin count. Albumin responds to the nutritional state of human body while globulin responds to its immunoinflammatory state. There is a significant controversy around the link between the level of albumin and PSA. It has been observed that middle-aged males with a lower serum albumin level have higher PSA readings. Similar to this, a different study found a nonlinear relationship between the level of serum albumin and PSA, with a negative relationship observed between them when the serum albumin level was over 41 g. In contrast, a cross-sectional study noted that dietary protein intake was positively associated with an elevated PSA level when dietary protein intake exceeded a threshold of 181.8 g. A growing body of research suggests that immune inflammation plays an important role in the development of prostate cancer. Previous studies have shown that platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) seems to have a higher accuracy in screening for prostate cancer, which, together with neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), has significant predictive value for the development of metastatic prostate cancer. However, there is still no consensus on the relationship between AGR and prostate. It has been noted that a lower level of AGR before treatment is strongly associated with poorer pathologic outcomes; AGR may be a reliable serologic marker for prostate cancer. A retrospective analysis noted that patients suffering prostate cancer with a lower preoperative AGR level had a worse tumor recurrence-free survival. However, a meta-analysis of studies noted a failure to demonstrate a potential predictive role of AGR in the prognosis of non-metastatic prostate cancer.

In conclusion, the purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the level of serum AGR and PSA among American males of over 40, who had non-prostate cancer.

These findings suggest that the RAR, assessed via routine laboratory tests, could be a promising indicator that is simple, reliable, and inexpensive for identifying individuals at high risk of mortality in clinical practice.

### Why Do the mechanistic actions of albumin not translate into tangible clinical benefits? [^209dc5b0]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Albumin has only reduced crude mortality in one randomized controlled trial conducted to date. This raises the question as to why potentially beneficial oncotic and pleiotropic properties of albumin do not consistently translate into clinically important outcomes. Four postulated explanations are provided as to why the theoretical advantages of albumin are not apparent in clinical trials: diminished oncotic action due to leakage of albumin from the intravascular compartment, modification of the pleiotropic properties of albumin both in vitro and in vivo, the ability of other plasma proteins to take over the major functions of albumin, and possible adverse effects.

### The significance of C-reactive protein to albumin ratio in patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^778272d2]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients and methods

This was a prospective study of consecutive patients with stable decompensated cirrhosis who presented for pre-liver transplantation (LT) evaluation in our Department between 2010 and 2019. Decompensated cirrhosis was defined as a history of ascites, variceal bleeding and encephalopathy in patients with known cirrhosis. Patients were stable regarding their chronic liver disease: i.e. they had no active variceal bleeding, encephalopathy or infection, such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), during the last month before admission. Detailed clinical evaluation, laboratory measurements (including procalcitonin, blood cultures and ascitic fluid paracentesis) and radiological exams (chest x-ray, upper abdominal ultrasound), when necessary, were performed in order to exclude patients with clinical infection.

We examined our patients carefully and recorded their demographic, clinical and laboratory characteristics: age, sex, cause and duration of liver disease, previous complications of cirrhosis (i.e. variceal bleeding, encephalopathy or SBP), medication administered for the liver disease (duration and dosage), and vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate). We estimated basic serum laboratory variables: albumin, protein, gamma globulins, bilirubin (total and direct), clotting profile, creatinine, electrolytes (e.g. sodium and potassium), aminotransferases (aspartate and alanine), alkaline phosphatase, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, and lactate dehydrogenase. We evaluated our patients' prognosis by calculating their MELD and CTP scores. Finally, we calculated the CAR for our patients, as well as NLR and LMR. Based on our hospital's hematology and biochemical department, CRP has an upper limit of normal of 6 mg/L, the normal range for albumin is 3.5–5.2 g/dL and for gamma-globulins 2.3–3.4 g/dL. Normal range for neutrophil proportion is 45–75%, for monocytes 2–11% and for lymphocytes 20–51%.

Multivariate analysis

On multivariate modeling, after controlling for significant baseline differences in demographics, clinical characteristics and medication exposure, a high globulin ratio remained significantly associated with higher rates of hospitalization in both CD and UC patients (Table 4). On the other hand, the association of elevated globulin fraction with increased need for IBD surgery remained significant only for the CD patients, but not the UC patients (Table 4).

### Predicting the overall survival and progression-free survival of nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients based on hemoglobin, albumin, and globulin ratio and classical clinicopathological parameters [^7c41c524]. Head & Neck (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Serum biomarkers have a significant impact on the prediction of treatment outcomes in patients diagnosed with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The primary aim of this study was to develop and validate a nomogram that incorporates hemoglobin, albumin, and globulin ratio (HAGR) and clinical data to accurately forecast treatment outcomes in patients with NPC.

Methods

A total of 796 patients diagnosed with NPC were included in the study.

Results

The results of the multivariate Cox analysis revealed that TNM stage and HAGR were found to be significant independent prognostic factors for OS and PFS. Furthermore, the utilization of the nomogram demonstrated a significant improvement in the evaluation of OS, PFS compared with the eighth TNM staging system. Additionally, the implementation of Kaplan-Meier curves and decision curve analysis curves further confirmed the discriminability and clinical effectiveness of the nomogram.

Conclusions

The HAGR, an innovative prognostic factor grounded in the realm of immunonutrition, has emerged as a promising prognostic marker for both OS and PFS in individuals afflicted with NPC.

### Association between albumin-to-globulin ratio and the risk of overall survival in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with anlotinib treatment: a retrospective cohort study [^85bf89ed]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Recently, the epidemiological survey released that lung cancer is still the most diagnosed type of cancer, accounting for 20% of global cancer-related mortality. Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the major type of lung cancer, accounting for approximately 85% of all primary lung cancers. At present, in addition to the traditional treatment methods, the rapid development of targeted therapy and immunotherapy has significantly improved the survival of lung cancer patients. The application of antiangiogenic drugs in lung cancer patients' treatment is considered to have good therapeutic effects. Anlotinib is a selective receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets vascular endothelial growth factor receptors, fibroblast growth factor receptors, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α and c-Kit. Based on the overall survival benefit observed in a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase III trial (ALTER0303), the China National Medical Products Administration approved anlotinib for the treatment of third-line advanced NSCLC. However, not all patients will benefit from anlotinib, thus, it is particularly of utmost importance to find prognostic biomarkers, which are simple, inexpensive and affordable, to select suitable patients. Albumin and globulin have attracted wide attention as non-invasive prognostic factors of tumors. Albumin can be used to reflect the nutritional and systemic inflammatory status of cancer patients and can be used as a prognostic marker for diverse cancers. Globulin, as one of the main cortisol-binding proteins, can participate in immune and inflammatory responses. As a combination of albumin and globulin, the albumin-to-globulin ratio (AGR) reflects both nutritional status and inflammatory response, which has been reported to be associated with the prognosis of several cancers. We suggest that AGR is a credible predictive parameter for several reasons. Firstly, a lower AGR level can be attributed to reduced albumin levels and/or elevated globulin levels, encompassing both significant unfavorable predictors and potentially enhancing the accuracy of predictions compared to individual parameters. Secondly, the advantage of AGR lies in its relative insensitivity to conditions such as dehydration and fluid retention, which can cause fluctuations in albumin and globulin levels. However, so far, there is no study that have reported the relationship between AGR and overall survival (OS) of advanced NSCLC patients treated with anlotinib. Therefore, we retrospectively studied the relationship between AGR and OS with the hypothesis that AGR level can be an independent protective factor for OS in advanced NSCLC patients treated with anlotinib.

### Prognostic significance of the albumin-to-globulin ratio for upper tract urothelial carcinoma [^e0a167c9]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) is a relatively rare malignancy that accounts for 5–10% of urothelial carcinomas and generally has a poor prognosis. Radical nephroureterectomy with bladder cuff excision is the gold standard treatment for nonmetastatic UTUC, whereas up to 19% of patients with UTUC have metastasis upon initial presentation.

Clinicopathological factors including laboratory markers serve as prognostic markers for UTUC. In contrast, the significance of the albumin-to-globulin ratio (AGR), which serves as a useful biomarker for various malignancies, has not been fully investigated in UTUC. Therefore, the present study assessed the significance of the association of preoperative AGR on oncological outcomes of patients with UTUC undergoing radical nephroureterectomy.

### Are we forgetting to carry out serum protein electrophoresis as part of diagnosis workup? [^152777ac]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Fig. 2
Serum protein electrophoresis. The numbers represent the electrophoretic run of different patients. When the sample is applied and the electric current is turned on, the serum proteins migrate differentially. Then, they are fixed and stained in blue. The most stained band is albumin, followed by alpha 1 globulin, alpha 2 globulin, beta globulin and gamma globulin. Column 6 shows a normal pattern of gamma globulin intensity and width. Column 7 is from the case reported, showing a marked reduction in the gamma globulin region. Column 8 was obtained from a patient with a monoclonal peak just after the beta globulin band and reduced gamma region. Column 3 displays a polyclonal gamma globulin augmentation (polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia). After staining, the results are read by spectrometry to quantify each band

Immunoglobulin A, G and M dosages were significantly reduced. IgA was 40 mg/dl (normal values: 70 to 400 mg/dL) while IgG was 270 mg/dL (normal values: 700 to 1600 mg/dL) and IgM was 25 mg/dl (normal values: 40 to 230 mg/dL). Peripheral blood lymphocyte count performed through flow cytometry showed B lymphocyte decrease to 2.12% (normal values: 5 to 15%). The CD4 count was 539 cells/µl (normal values: 410 to 1590 cells/µl), whereas that of CD8 was 1101 cells/µl (normal values: 190 to 1140 cells/µl). Therefore, the CD4/CD8 ratio was 0.47 (normal values: 0.9 to 2.6). The percentage of NK lymphocytes was 7.36% (normal values: 5 to 15%).

After confirming the CVID diagnosis, the patient missed follow-up again and returned two years later, complaining of epigastric pain. EGD and biopsies revealed poorly differentiated intestinal type gastric adenocarcinoma in the posterior wall of the gastric body. He was operated on, but did not tolerate the chemotherapy and passed away one year after the surgery, due to pneumonia and septic shock.

### Clinical practice guidelines for hypothyroidism in adults: cosponsored by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and the American Thyroid Association [^6beb4afc]. Endocrine Practice (2012). Medium credibility.

Assessment of free thyroxine (T4) — T4 is bound to specific binding proteins including T4-binding globulin (TBG), transthyretin and albumin, and approximately 99.97% of T4 is protein-bound, so total T4 is affected by binding changes; assessment of serum free T4 has now largely replaced measurement of serum total T4 as a measure of thyroid status. Methods include the serum free T4 index or free T4 estimate derived from total T4 and a thyroid hormone binding ratio or T3-resin uptake, and direct immunoassay of free T4 with physical separation using equilibrium dialysis or ultrafiltration, or without physical separation using anti-T4 antibody. In pregnancy, free T4 index or estimate shows normal values, whereas direct immunoassays show reduced values in pregnancy compared to nonpregnant reference ranges; both approaches show normal values with alterations in TBG binding.

Regarding quality improvement for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to requirements for laboratories, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to implement the following laboratory reporting and handling standards to ensure precision and reliability when evaluating urine samples:

- analyze samples for albumin measurement fresh or stored at 4 °C for up to 7 days

- do not store samples for albumin measurement frozen at -20 °C

- report albumin-to-creatinine ratio in untimed urine samples in addition to urine albumin concentration rather than the concentrations alone

- report to 1 decimal place for albumin-to-creatinine ratio whether mg/mmol or mg/g

- ensure the analytical coefficient of variation of methods to measure urine albumin is < 15%.

### Albumin-globulin ratio and mortality in patients on peritoneal dialysis: a retrospective study [^12988461]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

There is an increasing number of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients around the world. It was reported that the population of ESRD patients was more than 762,331 in 2016 according to the US Renal Data System 2018 Annual Data Report. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is an effective therapy for ESRD. Although there are some advantages of PD, the survival rate of PD patients remains inadequate. Hong Kong, which has the largest proportion of PD patients in the world, reported that the overall 5-years cumulative survival for PD patients was 50.7% in 2012; therefore, the risk factors associated with the mortality of PD patients are discommode.

The measured serum total protein includes albumin, globulin and prothrombotic proteins, prothrombin, fibrinogen, and other inflammatory proteins (e.g. C-reactive protein [CRP], interleukins, leukotrienes, and others). The albumin-globulin ratio (AGR), frequently reported in the comprehensive blood panel, calculated with the following equation: AGR = Albumin / [Total Protein-Albumin], is actually a reflection of all non-albumin proteins, which includes globulin and other prothrombotic proteins and inflammatory proteins.

Albumin functions include maintaining plasma colloid osmotic pressure, transporting substances, and acting as an antioxidant. Serum albumin can reflect both inflammatory and malnourished status. A low serum albumin level is a key characteristic of protein-energy wasting (PEW), which is common and an important risk factor for morbidity and mortality in patients on dialysis. Immunoglobulins, represent a major portion of the globulin involved in immunologic and inflammatory processes. Inflammation was related to the prognosis of ESRD patients, that inflammatory cytokines and CRP were reported as strong predictors of a poor outcome in dialysis patients. Recent studies suggested that AGR was associated with adverse outcomes in patients with different types of cancer and some other diseases such as polyangiitis and heart failure. However, there was a lack of direct clinical evidence for the association of AGR and outcomes of PD patients. In this retrospective observational cohort study, we tested the hypothesis that AGR is a predictor of mortality in PD patients.

### The significance of C-reactive protein to albumin ratio in patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^e53e7dc0]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

LT significantly improves the survival and quality of life of patients with end-stage cirrhosis. However, a large proportion of cirrhotic patients still die while on the transplant list, partly because of the lack of an accurate prediction of life expectancy. Many prognostic models have been proposed in the last 2 decades to predict mortality in cirrhosis. Recently, however, it was shown that the short-term prognosis depends largely on events that temporarily worsen or are superimposed on liver failure, emphasizing the need for powerful prognostic markers able to identify severely cirrhotic patients with the highest short-term mortality risk.

Patients with cirrhosis have a high risk of bacterial infections, which burdens their outcome, so early diagnosis and treatment is essential to improve their prognosis. High CRP levels, associated with systemic inflammatory response syndrome and infections, may identify those patients with severe cirrhosis who have a higher short-term risk of mortality. Elevation of serum gamma globulin levels is known to be a frequent occurrence in patients with chronic liver disease. This might reflect systemic inflammation and endotoxemia derived from gut microbiota, associated with the development of the decompensating complications seen in cirrhosis. Hence, inflammation-based prognostic scores such as CAR are worthy of studying in patients with decompensated cirrhosis.

### Relationship between albumin-globulin ratio and prostate-specific antigen: a cross-sectional study based on NHANES 2003–2010 [^cfa75f63]. BMC Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

The albumin-globulin ratio (AGR) influences the development of prostate cancer; however, the relationship between AGR and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has not been reported.

Methods

This cross-sectional investigation used comprehensive AGR versus PSA data from men with 40 years of age and older, who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2003 to 2010, spanning 4 investigation cycles, as only these cycles contained complete PSA data. To evaluate the nonlinear relationship between the ARG and PSA level, a regression utilizing smoothed curve fitting (penalized spline approach) and a generalized additive model (GAM) were employed. A two-segment linear regression model was used to conduct threshold effect evaluations. Lastly, subgroup analyses were carried out along with interaction tests.

Results

This study included 5,376 subjects, whose total serum PSA (mean ± standard deviation) was 1.83 ± 3.34, and its level decreased roughly with increasing quartiles of AGR. In the fully-adjusted model, AGR was negatively correlated with the likelihood of PSA, and this relationship persisted across subgroups (trend > 0.05). The PSA was characterized by an "L"-shaped curve with an inflection point. On the left side of the inflection point (K = 1.32), there was a negative relationship between AGR and PSA.

Conclusion

In the United States, among men over 40 years of age without prostate diseases, AGR demonstrated a nonlinear relationship with PSA, negatively correlating when AGR was below 1.32.

Threshold effect analysis

Generalized additive models and smooth curve fittings were performed to find the non-linear relationship between serum albumin, serum globulin, AGR and muscle mass (Figs. 2, 3 and 4). The results demonstrated linear relationships between globulin and muscle mass (Fig. 2 b), albumin and muscle mass (Fig. 3 b) in men, and non-linear relationships between albumin and muscle mass in women (Fig. 3 b), AGR and muscle mass in men (Fig. 4 b). Then threshold effect values of serum albumin in women and AGR in men were identified by using two-piecewise linear regression models (Table 5).

### Interpretation of results… [^a5ee7c91]. AAFP (2005). Low credibility.

Components of Serum Protein Electrophoresis The pattern of serum protein electrophoresis results depends on the fractions of two major types of protein: albumin and globulins. Albumin, the major protein component of serum, is produced by the liver under normal physiologic conditions. Globulins comprise a much smaller fraction of the total serum protein content. The subsets of these proteins and their relative quantity are the primary focus of the interpretation of serum protein electrophoresis. 1, 3 Albumin, the largest peak, lies closest to the positive electrode. The next five components are labeled alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, beta 2, and gamma. The peaks for these components lie toward the negative electrode, with the gamma peak being closest to that electrode. Figure 1 shows a typical normal pattern for the distribution of proteins as determined by serum protein electrophoresis. 1 and alpha 2 components.

The alpha 1-protein fraction is comprised of alpha 1-antitrypsin, thyroid-binding globulin, and transcortin. Malignancy and acute inflammation can increase the alpha 1-protein band. A decreased alpha 1-protein band may occur because of alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency or decreased production of the globulin as a result of liver disease. Ceruloplasmin, alpha 2-macroglobulin, and haptoglobin contribute to the alpha 2-protein band. The alpha 2 component is increased as an acute-phase reactant. BETA FRACTION The beta fraction has two peaks labeled beta 1 and beta 2. Beta 1 is composed mostly of transferrin, and beta 2 contains beta-lipoprotein. IgA, IgM, and sometimes IgG, along with complement proteins, also can be identified in the beta fraction. In the interpretation of serum protein electrophoresis, most attention focuses on the gamma region, which is composed predominantly of antibodies of the IgG type.

The gamma-globulin zone is decreased in hypogammaglobulinemia and agammaglobulinemia. Diseases that produce an increase in the gamma-globulin level include Hodgkin's disease, malignant lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, granulomatous diseases, connective tissue diseases, liver diseases, multiple myeloma, Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, and amyloidosis.

### Albumin-globulin ratio and mortality in patients on peritoneal dialysis: a retrospective study [^a2eae1dd]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Albumin-globulin ratio (AGR), a variable based on serum albumin and non-albumin proteins, has been demonstrated as a predictor of mortality in patients with malignant neoplasm. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of AGR on peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients.

Methods

We retrospectively analyzed 602 incident PD patients from January 1st, 2008, to December 31st, 2017, at our center and followed them until December 31st, 2018. Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariate Cox regression models were applied to analyze the association between AGR and all-cause of mortality and cardiovascular mortality.

Results

The median follow-up time was 32.17 (interquartile range = 32.80) months. During follow-up, 131 (21.8%) patients died, including 57 patients (43.5%) who died due to cardiovascular diseases. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that patients with AGR > 1.26 had better rates of survival than those with AGR ≤ 1.25 (p < 0.001). After adjusting for potential confounders, the lower AGR level was significantly associated with an increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality [hazard ratio (HR): 1.57, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07–2.32, p = 0.022 and HR: 2.01, 95% CI: 1.10–3.69, p = 0.023 respectively].

Conclusions

Patients with a low AGR level had an increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. AGR may be a useful index in identifying patients on PD at risk for CVD and all-cause of mortality.

### Association of serum globulin with all-cause mortality in incident hemodialysis patients [^c6bb2e53]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Serum globulin is a major component of total protein and can be elevated in inflammatory disease states. While inflammation is common in hemodialysis patients and associated with mortality and morbidity, the association between serum globulin and mortality has never been examined in hemodialysis patients.

Methods

In a retrospective cohort of 104164 incident hemodialysis patients treated by a large dialysis organization from 2007 to 2011, we explored the association between baseline serum globulin, albumin: globulin (A:G) ratio and serum protein levels and all-cause, cardiovascular and infection-related mortality with adjustments for demographic variables and laboratory markers of malnutrition and inflammation using Cox proportional hazards models.

Results

Patients with a globulin concentration > 3.8 g/dL had a higher all-cause and infection-related mortality risk {hazard ratio [HR] 1.11 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06–1.16] and HR 1.28 [95% CI 1.09–1.51], respectively} in the fully adjusted model when compared with the reference group of 3.0- < 3.2 g/dL. In addition, patients with an A:G ratio < 0.75 had a 45% higher all-cause mortality hazard [HR 1.45 (95% CI 1.38–1.52)] and patients with total serum protein < 5.5 g/dL had a 34% higher risk of death [1.34 (95% CI 1.27–1.42)] when compared with the reference (A:G ratio 1.05- < 1.15 and total serum protein 6.5- < 7 g/dL).

Conclusions

Among incident hemodialysis patients, a higher globulin level was associated with a higher mortality risk independent of other markers of malnutrition and inflammation, including albumin. A lower A:G ratio and serum protein was also associated with a higher mortality hazard. The mechanisms that contribute to elevated serum globulin should be further explored.

### Prognostic significance of the albumin-to-globulin ratio for upper tract urothelial carcinoma [^5986ad2f]. BMC Urology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Although the albumin-to-globulin ratio (AGR) is a promising biomarker for various malignancies, few studies have investigated its prognostic significance for upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC).

Methods

This retrospective study conformed to the REporting recommendations for tumour MARKer prognostic studies (REMARK) guideline. We reviewed 179 patients with UTUC who underwent radical nephroureterectomy at our institution between 2008 and 2018. Associations of preoperative clinicopathological factors, including the AGR, with cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed. The Cox proportional hazards model was used for univariate and multivariable analyses. AGR was dichotomized as < 1.25 and ≥ 1.25, according to the most discriminatory cutoff determined from the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis.

Results

During a median follow-up of 34months after surgery, 37 patients died from UTUC and 13 died of other causes. The preoperative AGR significantly correlated with pathological T stage, pathological N stage, and adjuvant chemotherapy. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that a decreased (< 1.25) preoperative AGR was an independent poor prognostic factor for both CSS (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.81, P < 0.01) and OS (HR = 2.09, P < 0.05).

Conclusions

Preoperative AGR < 1.25 might serve as a useful prognostic marker for patients with UTUC undergoing radical nephroureterectomy.

### Low preoperative prealbumin predicts the prevalence of complications following liver transplantation [^6266d272]. BMC Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Clinical characteristics

As shown in Table 2, clinical and pathological characteristics were included in the univariable logistic regression analysis, and preoperative MELD score, ASA score, albumin and prealbumin were found to be significantly correlated with the incidence of postoperative complications. After multivariable adjustment, MELD score, preoperative prealbumin and hypertension were shown to be independent predictive factors for postoperative complications. The odds ratios of a MELD score > 15, low levels of preoperative prealbumin and hypertension were 2.86 (95% CI 1.29–6.34), 4.40 (95% CI 1.51–12.80) and 4.09 (95% CI 1.15–14.49), respectively. However, although significant in the univariable analysis, serum albumin did not demonstrate predictive ability in the multivariable analysis.

Results

Patients' baseline characteristics are summarized in Table 1. The median follow-up was 34 months (interquartile range [IQR], 17–63) months. Thirty-seven patients died from UTUC and 13 died of other causes. ROC curve analysis identified 1.25 as the most discriminatory cutoff value of AGR by maximization of the Youden's index [Sensitivity − (1 − Specificity)] for both endpoints of CSS and OS (Fig. 1).

χ² test revealed pathological T stage (≥ T3, P < 0.01), pathological N stage (N1–3, P < 0.01), and adjuvant chemotherapy (yes, P < 0.05) to be significantly associated with AGR < 1.25, while the other variables (sex, surgical technique, tumor location, tumor grade and previous or synchronous bladder cancer) were not. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient showed a weakly significant negative correlation between age at surgery and the AGR (ρ = − 0.25, P < 0.01).

Kaplan–Meier curves with log-rank tests showed significant associations of preoperative AGR < 1.25 with shorter CSS (Fig. 2) and OS (Fig. 3). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analyses identified preoperative AGR < 1.25 as an independent poor prognostic factor for both CSS (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.81, P < 0.01) (Table 2) and OS (HR = 2.09, P < 0.05; Table 3).

### Genome-wide association study of serum albumin: globulin ratio in Korean populations [^18564d2d]. Journal of Human Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Low albumin:globulin (A/G) ratios are associated with vascular adverse events, nephrotic syndrome and autoimmune disease. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have been identifying genetic variants associated with total serum protein, serum albumin and globulins, but A/G ratio has never been considered the target phenotype. To identify the genetic basis of the A/G ratio, we performed a GWAS on A/G ratio in 4205 individuals from the Ansan cohort and confirmed the results in 4637 subjects from the Ansung cohort. The single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes of Affymetrix SNP array 5.0 were obtained from the Korean Association Resource Consortium, and we selected 290659 common SNPs with a minor allele frequency > 0.05. Genetic factors for A/G ratio were analyzed by linear regression analysis, controlling for age, sex, body mass index, smoking status and alcohol drinking status as covariates. From the GWAS of the Ansan cohort, we identified two significant genome-wide signals (P-values < 5 × 10⁻⁸) and 36 moderate signals (P-value < 1.0 × 10⁻⁴). These 38 signals were tested in the Ansung population. Eleven SNPs from six loci (GALNT2, IRF4, HLA-DBP1, SLC31A1, FADS1 and TNFRSF13B) were replicated, with P-values < 0.05. The most compelling association was observed in the TNFRSF13B locus on chromosome 17p11.2 (SNP: rs4561508), with an overall combined P-value = 7.80 × 10⁻²⁴. The other significant signal was observed on chromosome 11q12.2-the FADS1 locus (SNP: rs174548)-with an overall combined P-value = 3.54 × 10⁻⁸.

### The significance of C-reactive protein to albumin ratio in patients with decompensated cirrhosis [^3261318d]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Recently, Cacciola et al studied the role of serum gamma globulins in relation to the clinical outcome in cirrhotic patients. They proved that hypergammaglobulinemia is a strong predictor of disease progression, hepatocellular carcinoma and death in patients with cirrhosis, and that hypergammaglobulinemia may help identify the CTP class A cirrhotics with a poorer prognosis. Our results, however, showed that MELD and CTP score were superior to gamma globulins in predicting mortality, and that gamma globulins were not significant predictive markers for our patients' outcome in Cox regression analysis.

Our study has several limitations, notably its relatively small sample size. This could downgrade our results. Further and larger studies are needed to verify our findings.

In conclusion, we managed for the first time to investigate the prognostic role of 4 different inflammatory markers in decompensated cirrhotic patients with various etiologies. Our results suggest the significance of CAR and LMR in outcomes and patients' renal function. CAR was associated with the prognosis of patients with decompensated cirrhosis. In general, inflammatory markers appeared to play significant roles in these patients.

Summary Box

What is already known:

- C-reactive protein to albumin ratio (CAR) has been found to predict long-term outcomes in patients with decompensated cirrhosis related to hepatitis B virus
- Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio predicts short-term mortality in hospitalized cirrhotics
- Other inflammatory markers, lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) and gamma globulins, have also emerged as inflammation-based prognostic factors in liver cirrhosis

What the new findings are:

- LMR with a cut-off of 1.9 could predict better renal function in decompensated patients
- Decompensated patients with CAR < 2.17 presented better survival
- Excluding model for end-stage liver disease and Child-Turcotte-Pugh scores, CAR ≥ 2.17 was independently associated with death in decompensated patients

KDIGO 2024 — Factors affecting interpretation of urine albumin or protein — Understand factors that may affect interpretation of measurements of urine albumin and urine creatinine and order confirmatory tests as indicated. Hematuria, menstruation, exercise, and infection can falsely elevate albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) or protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) by increasing albumin and protein in urine, while nonalbumin proteins can cause a false decrease because other proteins may be missed by albumin reagent strips. Variability in urinary creatinine concentration also affects ratios: females have lower urinary creatinine excretion therefore higher ACR and PCR, whereas males have higher urinary creatinine excretion therefore lower ACR and PCR; low weight with low urinary creatinine excretion can cause high ACR or PCR relative to timed excretion, whereas high weight with high urinary creatinine excretion can cause low ACR or PCR relative to timed excretion; lower creatinine excretion with acute kidney injury or low-protein intake, and higher creatinine excretion with high-protein intake or exercise, also influence results.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) urine albumin/protein testing — specimen selection and confirmation: Untimed urine samples are a reasonable first test for ascertainment of albuminuria, a first morning void sample is preferred, and a random urine sample is acceptable if no first morning void sample is available. Because creatinine excretion is fairly constant over 24 hours, albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) or protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) allows correction for urinary concentration; ACR is a suitable alternative to timed measurement and PCR on random or early morning untimed samples shows good diagnostic performance and correlation with 24-hour collection. Although the accurately timed 24-hour specimen remains a reference point, it is a difficult procedure to control; hydration affects urine concentration, and reporting albumin or protein to creatinine ratio will correct for urinary concentration and reduce intraindividual variability. Measurement of urinary albumin is recommended, positive tests should be confirmed and large changes repeated, and if more accurate quantification is required, measure urine albumin or total protein in a timed collection under supervised conditions. Commonly used reagent strip devices measuring total protein are insufficiently sensitive and only semiquantitative; the use of such strips should be discouraged in favor of quantitative laboratory measurements or validated point-of-care devices, and when used, reagent strip results should be confirmed by laboratory testing.

### New roles for albumin / globulin ratio in the early-onset hyperbilirubinemia among infants born weighing 1, 000 to 2, 499 grams [^00f2a026]. American Journal of Perinatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Early-onset hyperbilirubinemia (EOH) is a clinical issue for premature infants. We predicted that EOH management would be improved by fast results from common laboratory tests. Total serum bilirubin (TSB) level and the albumin/globulin ratio may contribute to improving the management of EOH.

Objective

The aim of the study is to examine the relationship between EOH and perinatal variables among infants born weighing 1,000 to 2,499g.

Study Designs

A single center study was undertaken at Ohta Nishinouchi Hospital between April 1, 2016 and January 31, 2022, using blood samples prospectively collected from infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit that were assessed by univariate analyses and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Due to a correlation between gestational age (GA) and birth weight (BW), each variable was entered separately into Model 1 (including GA) and 2 (including BW).

Results

A total of 508 infants were analyzed (270 in the non EOH group and 238 in the EOH group). No infants experienced feto-maternal transfusion syndrome or hemolytic diseases such as blood type (ABO or Rh) incompatibility or glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency during perinatal period. Significant relationships were observed between EOH and BW (p < 0.01, odds ratio [OR], 0.997; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.996–0.997), albumin (p < 0.01, OR, 0.278; 95% CI, 0.129–0.599), albumin/globulin ratio (p < 0.01, OR, 2.695; 95% CI, 1.378–5.270), TSB (p < 0.01, OR, 2.774; 95% CI, 1.795–4.287), and antenatal corticoid therapy (p = 0.02, OR, 1.852; 95% CI, 1.108–3.097) in Model 2. Per receiver operating characteristic curves, an albumin/globulin ratio of 1.84 could predict EOH at a sensitivity of 50.0% and specificity of 75.6% (AUC = 0.652, p < 0.01, 95% CI, 0.603–0.700).

Conclusion

Albumin/globulin ratio among infants born weighing 1,000 to 2,499g may be a useful indicator of EOH.

Key Points

· Early-onset hyperbilirubinemia (EOH) is a clinical issue for premature infants. · EOH management expected to be improved through the use of common laboratory tests. · Albumin/globulin ratio among low birth weight infants may be a useful indicator of EOH.

### Grading of severity of the condition in burn patients by serum protein and albumin / globulin studies [^438c5a8a]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Capillary permeability increases after inflammation with consequent leak of fluid, electrolytes, and proteins. The albumin molecule size being smaller (69 kDa) than the globulin molecule (90–156 kDa) will leak relatively at an early stage of the disease (with moderate increase in capillary pore size) than globulin leading to albumin/globulin reversal. In cases with severe permeability changes with rapid progression to larger pore size with simultaneous leak of both albumin and globulin, albumin/globulin reversal will not occur. In this study estimation the serum protein and albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio at frequent intervals was done to grade the severity of the condition of burn patients by assessing the severity of capillary leak. A total of 61 admitted patients (from March 2002 to December 2004) based on the protein values were divided into 3 groups (group 1: 6–8 g/dL, group 2: 5.1–5.9 g/dL, group 3: ≤ 5.0 g/dL), and all the patients who showed change in their protein levels during the study were shifted to appropriate group and were classified as group shifters. The mean survival time and mortality of various groups were compared, and A/G ratio of all the expired cases was analyzed. Group 3 patients showed higher mortality (95%) as compared to that in other groups (group 1 and 2: 0% each and group shifters: 30.2%). Median survival time of group 3 was significantly low as compared to that of group 1 (P < 0.0026), group 2 (P < 0.0006), and group shifters (P < 0.0000). In group shifters the mean time (days) required for shifting from one group to other just before death or discharge in survivors was significantly higher than that in expired cases. Of 26 cases expired during the study, initial A/G ratio at the time of first assigning the group was not reversed in 22 cases (84.6%). The study concluded that the severity (indicated by lower serum protein values) and speed (judged by A/G ratio changes and median survival time analysis) of capillary permeability changes were associated with high mortality, and therefore, it is possible to grade the severity of the condition in burn patients.

### Albumin administration in the acutely ill: what is new and where next? [^30395c3f]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

Should albumin infusions target albumin levels?

The need to make decisions as to whether or not a particular patient should receive albumin based on their albumin level is related to whether the considered use is targeted as resuscitation or supplementation. Most patients requiring resuscitation fluids in the ICU are hypoalbuminemic and, as mentioned earlier, the fluid will be given largely for its effects on COP – that is, limiting edema formation – provided that the hydrostatic pressure does not increase excessively. In such patients, monitoring the albumin concentration is probably of little value.

In more prolonged administration as supplementation, however, serum albumin levels may be a useful guide to ongoing needs, in combination with disease severity, hemodynamic status, and nutritional status; just as an arbitrary cutoff hemoglobin concentration should not be used to define absolute need for blood transfusion in all patients, so a specific serum albumin threshold for albumin administration is unlikely to be relevant to all. The meta-analysis of nine prospective controlled trials on correcting hypoalbuminemia in acutely ill patients mentioned earlier suggested that complication rates were reduced in patients who achieved serum albumin concentrations > 30 g/l after albumin administration. As a result, the ALBIOS study protocol stipulated that albumin administration should be titrated to maintain serum albumin ≥ 30 g/l. Albumin levels were measured on a daily basis and 200 or 300 mL of 20% albumin were administered in patients with albumin levels between 25 and 30 g/l or < 25 g/l, respectively. Following the time course of albumin levels, especially in response to an albumin infusion, may be more valuable than a single albumin level, but optimal albumin levels during critical illness are not clearly defined.

What type of albumin preparation?

Currently available human albumin solutions are developed using various techniques, such that the various commercially available albumin solutions may differ in protein content and composition, binding capacity, metal ion content, antioxidant properties, charge, capacity to bind drugs, and so forth. This is a difficult topic to evaluate because there are few data available about the precise composition of the different albumin solutions and whether or how this may impact on its clinical properties, but the differences may help explain some of the different study results. One study comparing six different commercially available preparations of albumin with serum albumin from healthy volunteers reported large differences between the solutions, particularly in terms of the presence of oxidized cysteine 34 (23% in human volunteer albumin vs 54 to 60% in commercial preparations), which may influence the properties and hence the clinical impact of albumin solutions. Precise compositions of albumin solution should be clearly identified in future study reports.

### Sex and gender differences in clinical pharmacology: implications for transgender medicine [^c05970ee]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

DISTRIBUTION

Protein binding

Major plasma binding proteins include albumin, alpha 1‐acid glycoprotein, and globulins. Changes in plasma drug binding can either increase or decrease free drug exposure. Protein‐binding interactions contribute to clinically significant changes in free drug exposure for non‐oral, high extraction ratio drugs (e.g. intravenous lidocaine). Most medications are not susceptible to clinically significant protein‐binding interactions. Clinical examples of sex‐related differences in protein‐binding interactions are lacking.

Although no studies have characterized changes in tissue or plasma drug binding for any medication taken by transgender adults, several have summarized changes in plasma protein concentrations during hormone therapy (Table 3). In two small studies of 17 and 30 transgender men undergoing testosterone treatment, serum albumin concentrations were unchanged relative to testosterone‐naïve baseline concentrations. Conversely, corticosteroid‐binding globulin concentrations decreased in a small study of 15 transgender men taking testosterone therapy (20%, P < 0.01). Sex hormone binding globulin concentrations decreased in several prospective studies of between 10 to 53 transgender men taking testosterone therapy (42–54%, respectively, P < 0.01).,

During estrogen treatment, a prospective study of 29 transgender women reported a slight decrease in serum albumin concentrations (4%, P < 0.01 vs. estrogen‐naïve baseline concentrations), although a separate study of 15 transgender women taking transdermal estradiol reported no significant change (P = 0.12). In several prospective studies of up to ~ 50 transgender women, concentrations of sex hormone binding globulin increased threefold during either oral or injectable estradiol treatment (P < 0.001), whereas investigators observed no change in individuals taking transdermal gel or patch preparations. Finally, in a small study of 10 transgender women, corticosteroid‐binding globulin concentrations were similar before and during estrogen treatment, although most participants took non‐oral 17β‐estradiol preparations. Drug protein binding data in transgender adults may be important for pharmacokinetic modeling, but clinically significant protein‐mediated drug interactions during hormone therapy may be unlikely.

### KDIGO clinical practice guideline for lipid management in CKD: summary of recommendation statements and clinical approach to the patient [^895268dc]. Kidney International (2014). Medium credibility.

Albuminuria assessment for living donor evaluation — measurement method and thresholds are recommended as follows: We recommend measurement of albumin rather than total protein, and albumin excretion rate (AER) in a timed urine collection rather than albumin-creatinine ratio (ACR) in a spot specimen if possible. We recommend an AER threshold of less than 30 mg/d to routinely accept a donor candidate and an intermediate range of AER 30 to 100 mg/d in which to individualize decisions based on other risk factors. We acknowledge that AER of 30 to 100 mg/d meets the criteria for CKD, yet candidates have not been excluded solely on this basis. We do not require tests of total urine protein in addition to albumin because normal ranges for nonalbumin protein excretion are not accepted.

### Hypoalbuminemia in acute illness: is there a rationale for intervention? A meta-analysis of cohort studies and controlled trials [^0ec23fdf]. Annals of Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether hypoalbuminemia is an independent risk factor for poor outcome in the acutely ill, and to assess the potential of exogenous albumin administration for improving outcomes in hypoalbuminemic patients.

Summary Background Data

Hypoalbuminemia is associated with poor outcomes in acutely ill patients, but whether this association is causal has remained unclear. Trials investigating albumin therapy to correct hypoalbuminemia have proven inconclusive.

Methods

A meta-analysis was conducted of 90 cohort studies with 291,433 total patients evaluating hypoalbuminemia as an outcome predictor by multivariate analysis and, separately, of nine prospective controlled trials with 535 total patients on correcting hypoalbuminemia.

Results

Hypoalbuminemia was a potent, dose-dependent independent predictor of poor outcome. Each 10-g/L decline in serum albumin concentration significantly raised the odds of mortality by 137%, morbidity by 89%, prolonged intensive care unit and hospital stay respectively by 28% and 71%, and increased resource utilization by 66%. The association between hypoalbuminemia and poor outcome appeared to be independent of both nutritional status and inflammation. Analysis of dose-dependency in controlled trials of albumin therapy suggested that complication rates may be reduced when the serum albumin level attained during albumin administration exceeds 30 g/L.

Conclusions

Hypoalbuminemia is strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes. Further well-designed trials are needed to characterize the effects of albumin therapy in hypoalbuminemic patients. In the interim, there is no compelling basis to withhold albumin therapy if it is judged clinically appropriate.

Albuminuria and proteinuria categories — Normal to mildly increased (A1), Moderately increased (A2), and Severely increased (A3) thresholds are provided across measurement methods. Albumin excretion rate (AER) (mg/d): < 30, 30–300, > 300. Protein excretion rate (PER) (mg/d): < 150, 150–500, > 500. Albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) as mg/mmol: < 3, 3–30, > 30 and as mg/g: < 30, 30–300, > 300. Protein-creatinine ratio (PCR) as mg/mmol: < 15, 15–50, > 50 and as mg/g: < 150, 150–500, > 500. Protein reagent strip categories correspond to Negative to trace, Trace to +, and + or greater. Relationships among methods are not exact and are based on the assumption that average creatinine excretion rate is approximately 1.0 g/d or 10 mmol/d; conversions are rounded, with an exact conversion from mg/g creatinine to mg/mmol creatinine by multiplying by 0.113; relationships among categories are approximate and depend on urine concentration.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for chronic kidney disease, more specifically with respect to evaluation of albuminuria, KDIGO 2024 guidelines recommend to use more accurate methods when albuminuria is detected on less accurate methods:

- confirm reagent strip positive albuminuria and/or proteinuria by quantitative laboratory measurement and express as a ratio to urine creatinine wherever possible (quantify the albumin-to-creatinine ratio or protein-to-creatinine ratio if initial semiquantitative tests are positive)

- confirm albumin-to-creatinine ratio ≥ 30 mg/g (≥ 3 mg/mmol) on a random untimed urine with a subsequent first morning void in the urine sample.

### The factors associated with cognitive function among community-dwelling older adults in Taiwan [^900ffe4e]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Our participants in the cognitive impairment group were less likely to be physically active. Overall, 62.3% of the participants without cognitive impairment compared to only 30.1% of the cognitive impairment group had an exercise habit within the past six months. This is consistent with previous studies that have reported a positive association between exercise and cognitive function. A meta-analysis of 15 studies concluded that physical activity significantly protected against cognitive decline. Current and consistent exercise habits among Taiwanese seniors led to better cognitive performance on the SPMSQ over the course of an eight-year follow-up study.

Our results indicated that participants with a higher albumin level had a lower risk of cognitive impairment. Lower albumin levels have been reported to be correlated with poor cognitive performance in older adults. In a previous study done in Japan, a positive association between the serum albumin/globulin ratio (A/G ratio) and cognitive function was found in 70-year-old and 80-year-old participants. Similar to our study, the Asian study participants also had normal albumin levels. Since albumin is seen as a marker for nutritional status and inflammation, a low albumin level may indicate malnutrition, chronic hepatitis, nephrotic syndrome or an inflammation status. Thus, higher albumin levels may be associated with healthier individuals and possibly having better cognitive function as well.

### Testosterone (Natesto) [^41888c20]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1. Mechanism of Action

Endogenous androgens, including testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), are responsible for the normal growth and development of the male sex organs and for maintenance of secondary sex characteristics. These effects include the growth and maturation of the prostate, seminal vesicles, penis, and scrotum; the development of male hair distribution, such as facial, pubic, chest, and axillary hair; laryngeal enlargement, vocal cord thickening, alterations in body musculature, and fat distribution. Testosterone and DHT are necessary for the normal development of secondary sex characteristics.

Male hypogonadism, a clinical syndrome resulting from insufficient secretion of testosterone, has two main etiologies. Primary hypogonadism is caused by defects of the gonads, such as Klinefelter's syndrome or Leydig cell aplasia, whereas secondary hypogonadism is the failure of the hypothalamus (or pituitary) to produce sufficient gonadotropins (FSH, LH).

12.2. Pharmacodynamics

No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted using Natesto.

Absorption

Natesto delivers physiologic amounts of testosterone, producing circulating concentrations that approximate normal testosterone concentrations (i.e., 300 to 1,050 ng/dL) seen in healthy men. The maximum concentration for Natesto is achieved within approximately 40 minutes of administration and has a half-life ranging from 10 to 100 minutes.

Figure 1 summarizes the pharmacokinetic profiles of total testosterone in patients completing 90 days of Natesto treatment administered as 33 mg of testosterone daily (11 mg three times daily).

Figure 1: Mean Serum Total Testosterone Concentrations on Day 90 Following Natesto Administered As 11 mg of Testosterone Three Times Daily (N = 69)

The average daily testosterone concentration produced by Natesto administered as 11 mg of testosterone three times daily on Day 90 was 421 (± 116) ng/dL.

Distribution

Circulating testosterone is primarily bound in the serum to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin. Approximately 40% of testosterone in plasma is bound to SHBG, 2% remains unbound (free), and the rest is loosely bound to albumin and other proteins.

Metabolism

Testosterone is metabolized to various 17-keto steroids through 2 different pathways. The major active metabolites of testosterone are estradiol and dihydrotestosterone (DHT).

DHT concentrations increased in parallel with testosterone concentrations during Natesto treatment. After 90 days of treatment, the mean DHT/testosterone ratio was 0.09 which was within the normal range.

12.3 Pharmacokinetics

Absorption and Bioavailability

XYOSTED delivers physiologic amounts of testosterone, producing circulating testosterone concentrations that approximate normal concentrations (300–1100 ng/dL) seen in healthy men.

Following weekly subcutaneous injection of XYOSTED for 12 weeks, serum testosterone concentrations reached a maximum after a median of 11.9 hours post-dose (range: 5.8–168.7 hours) then slowly declined (Figure 1). In this study, the starting dose of XYOSTED was 75 mg weekly then the XYOSTED dose was adjusted based upon total testosterone trough concentrations obtained following 6 weeks of dosing [see Dosage and Administration (2.2)]. Steady state serum testosterone concentration was achieved by Week 6.

aReported as median

Distribution

Circulating testosterone is primarily bound in serum to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin. Approximately 40% of testosterone in plasma is bound to SHBG, 2% remains unbound (free), and the rest is loosely bound to albumin and other proteins.

Elimination

Metabolism

Testosterone enanthate is metabolized to testosterone via ester cleavage of the enanthate group. The mean (SD) maximum concentration of testosterone enanthate was 169 (68) ng/dL at Week 12 following weekly administration of XYOSTED.

Testosterone is metabolized to various 17-keto steroids through two different pathways. The major active metabolites of testosterone are estradiol and dihydrotestosterone (DHT). At pre-dose of Week 12 treatment, the mean DHT/testosterone ratio was 0.07 which was within the normal range.

Excretion

About 90% of a testosterone dose given intramuscularly is excreted in the urine as glucuronic and sulfuric acid-conjugates of testosterone or as metabolites. About 6% of a dose is excreted in the feces, mostly in the unconjugated form. Inactivation of testosterone occurs primarily in the liver.

### Association between albumin-to-globulin ratio and the risk of overall survival in advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients with anlotinib treatment: a retrospective cohort study [^4038046a]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

Researches about the association between serum albumin-to-globulin ratio (AGR) and the prognosis of lung cancer are limited. We aimed to investigate the relationship between AGR and overall survival (OS) in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with anlotinib.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study was conducted on 196 advanced NSCLC patients with anlotinib treatment between June 1, 2018 and June 1, 2021. The exposure was AGR, calculated by baseline serum albumin / (serum total protein - serum albumin). The outcome was OS, defined as the period from the date of initial treatment with anlotinib to death or the last follow-up. The univariate and multivariate linear regression models and generalized additive models (GAM) were used to analyze the relationship between AGR and OS. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to analyze the OS.

Results

After adjusting for potential confounders, a non-linear relationship was observed between AGR and OS, which had an inflection point of 1.24. The hazard ratio and the confidence intervals on the left and the right sides of the inflection point were 13.05 (0.52 to 327.64) and 0.20 (0.07 to 0.57), respectively. It suggested that AGR was positively associated with OS when AGR was larger than 1.24, for every 1 unit increase in AGR, the risk of death lowered approximately by 80%.

Conclusions

The relationship between AGR and the OS for advanced NSCLC patients with anlotinib is non-linear. AGR level is an independent protective factor for OS in advanced NSCLC patients who received anlotinib therapy.

### Serum albumin measurement in nephrology: room for improvement [^40285a37]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2022). Medium credibility.

Serum albumin is a widely used biomarker in clinical nephrology. Serum albumin cut-off values are used to define disease, to predict outcome and to guide patient care. The available commercial assays to measure serum albumin rely on different analytical principles, all with their own (analytical) specifications. This article provides an overview of the different clinical applications of serum albumin measurements in nephrology, the (dis)advantages of the available assays and the estimates of the effects of the measurement uncertainty between different assays in clinical decision making. This article concludes that harmonization of serum albumin assay results is needed.

### Albumin human — albumin — human [^faf991e8]. FDA (2008). Low credibility.

12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY

No pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic studies with ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 25% have been conducted.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Albumin is responsible for 75–80% of the colloid osmotic pressure of normal plasma. Albumin stabilizes circulating blood volume and is a carrier of hormones, enzymes, medicinal products and toxins. [3]

Albumin is a protein with a total extravascular mass of approximately 160 g and an intravascular mass of about 120 g. [3]

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

The colloid osmotic effect of ALBUMIN (HUMAN) 20% and 25% is approximately 5 times the volume administered. When injected intravenously, it will increase circulating plasma volume by approximately 3.5 times the volume infused within 15 minutes if the patient is adequately hydrated. This extra fluid reduces hemoconcentration and blood viscosity. The degree and duration of volume expansion depends upon the initial blood volume. When treating patients with diminished blood volume, the effect of infused albumin may persist for many hours. The hemodilution lasts for a shorter time when albumin is administered to individuals with normal blood volume. [4]

### Bilirubin-albumin binding, bilirubin / albumin ratios, and free bilirubin levels: where do we stand? [^4cb2320c]. Seminars in Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Treatment for unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is predominantly based on one parameter, i.e., total serum bilirubin (TSB) levels. Yet, overt kernicterus has been reported in preterm infants at relatively low TSB levels, and it has been repeatedly shown that free unconjugated bilirubin (freeUCB) levels, or bilirubin/albumin (B/A) ratios for that matter, are more closely associated with bilirubin neurotoxicity. In this article, we review bilirubin-albumin binding, UCBfree levels, and B/A ratios in addition to TSB levels to individualize and optimize treatment especially in preterm infants. Methods to measure bilirubin-albumin binding or UCBfree are neither routinely performed in Western clinical laboratories nor incorporated in current management guidelines on unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. For bilirubin-albumin binding, this seems justified because several of these methods have been challenged, and sufficiently powered prospective trials on the clinical benefits are lacking. Technological advances in the measurement of UCBfree may provide a convenient means for integrating UCBfree measurements into routine clinical management of jaundiced infants. A point-of-care method, as well as determination of UCBfree levels in various newborn populations, is desirable to learn more about variations in time and how various clinical pathophysiological conditions affect UCBfree levels. This will improve the estimation of approximate UCBfree levels associated with neurotoxicity. To delineate the role of UCBfree in the management of jaundiced (preterm) infants, trials are needed using UCBfree as treatment parameter. The additional use of the B/A ratio in jaundiced preterms has been evaluated in the Bilirubin Albumin Ratio Trial (BARTrial; Clinical Trials: ISRCTN74465643) but failed to demonstrate better neurodevelopmental outcome in preterm infants < 32 weeks assigned to the study group. Awaiting a study in which infants are assigned to be managed solely on the basis of their B/A ratio (with TSB excluded) versus TSB levels alone-and determining which group does better-the additional use of the B/A ratio in the management of hyperbilirubinemia in preterms is not advised. In conjunction with TSB levels, other parameters possibly allow for more accurate prediction of bilirubin toxicity. Yet, different methodologies for estimating these parameters exist, and sufficiently powered, prospective clinical trials supporting their clinical benefit, i.e., reduced bilirubin neurotoxicity when using these parameters, are lacking. Their use in addition to TSB needs to be prospectively evaluated, especially in preterm neonates, and preferentially in randomized clinical trials, which include specific risk factors and assessment of clinical relevant outcome measures for detecting those infants at risk of bilirubin toxicity.

### Plasma proteins and edema… [^f63f7bd9]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

In health, about four fifths of the solids of the plasma consist of plasma proteins. Their approximate percentages are as follows: total protein, from 7 to 8; albumin, from 4 to 5; globulin, from 1. 5 to
3. 5; fibrinogen, from 0. 1 to
0. 25; albumin-globulin ratio, 37. The colloidal osmotic pressure of the blood plasma is from 25 to 30 mm. of mercury and is maintained largely by the plasma proteins, as was first revealed by Starling. 1 The colloidal osmotic pressure of the blood plasma is not necessarily proportional to the total concentration of plasma protein, because the individual plasma proteins have different colloidal osmotic pressures. The total amount of protein may remain the same, while variations of the relative proportions of the different proteins may change the osmotic pressure.

### Testosterone (Axiron) [^3fbb5326]. FDA (2013). Low credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Endogenous androgens, including testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), are responsible for the normal growth and development of the male sex organs and for maintenance of secondary sex characteristics. These effects include the growth and maturation of prostate, seminal vesicles, penis and scrotum; the development of male hair distribution, such as facial, pubic, chest and axillary hair; laryngeal enlargement, vocal cord thickening, alterations in body musculature and fat distribution. Testosterone and DHT are necessary for the normal development of secondary sex characteristics. Male hypogonadism results from insufficient secretion of testosterone and is characterized by low serum testosterone concentrations. Signs/symptoms associated with male hypogonadism include erectile dysfunction and decreased sexual desire, fatigue and loss of energy, mood depression, regression of secondary sexual characteristics and osteoporosis.

Male hypogonadism has two main etiologies. Primary hypogonadism is caused by defects of the gonads, such as Klinefelter's Syndrome or Leydig cell aplasia, whereas secondary hypogonadism is the failure of the hypothalamus (or pituitary) to produce sufficient gonadotropins (FSH, LH).

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

No specific pharmacodynamic studies were conducted using AXIRON.

Absorption — AXIRON delivers physiologic circulating testosterone that approximate normal concentration range (i.e., 300–1050 ng/dL) seen in healthy men following application to the axilla.

On the skin, the ethanol and isopropyl alcohol evaporate leaving testosterone and octisalate. The skin acts as a reservoir from which testosterone is released into the systemic circulation over time (see Figure 1). In general, steady-state serum concentrations are achieved by approximately 14 days of daily dosing.

When AXIRON treatment is discontinued after achieving steady-state, serum testosterone concentrations returned to their pretreatment concentrations by 7–10 days after the last application.

Distribution — Circulating testosterone is primarily bound in the serum to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and albumin. Approximately 40% of testosterone in plasma is bound to SHBG, 2% remains unbound (free) and the rest is bound to albumin and other proteins.

Metabolism — Testosterone is metabolized to various 17-keto steroids through two different pathways. The major active metabolites of testosterone are estradiol and dihydrotestosterone (DHT).

DHT concentration increased in parallel with testosterone concentration during AXIRON treatment. The mean steady-state DHT/T ratio remained within normal limits and ranged from 0.17 to 0.26 across all doses on Days 15, 60, and 120.

### Effect of disease duration on the association between C-reactive protein-albumin ratio and endoscopic activity in ulcerative colitis [^9f97b5a7]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

The Selecting Therapeutic Targets in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (STRIDE) study recommended treat-to-target strategies for patients with IBD. While maintaining MH remains the larger goal, the normalization of serum and fecal biomarkers has been identified as a short-term target. The development of an easy, rapid, repeatable, and affordable serum marker for MH is one of the unmet needs related to maintaining MH in the clinical setting. Several novel biomarkers for MH have recently been reported, including the CAR as well as serum globulin, serum indirect bilirubin, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio, albumin/platelet ratio, and platelet/lymphocyte ratio. Our results indicate that CAR should be used as serum marker for disease activity and poor response to treatment but not for MH.

Only a few studies have explored the influence of disease duration on biomarker accuracy in patients with IBD. In patients with Crohn's disease, disease duration did not affect the utility of fecal calprotectin as a biomarker. In patients with UC, on the other hand, the immunochemical fecal occult blood test as a biomarker for MH is more accurate in patients with disease duration < 4 years. Similarly, serum albumin was found to be a useful marker for MH in patients with shorter UC duration but not in those with longer UC duration. In the present study, CAR was associated with disease activity only in UC patients with longer disease duration but not in those with shorter disease duration. It remains uncertain why disease duration affects the association between CAR and disease activity in patients with UC. Further research regarding the association between disease duration and serum biomarker accuracy in patients with UC is warranted.

### Higher levels of albuminuria within the normal range predict incident hypertension [^54e28bc1]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Higher levels of albumin excretion within the normal range are associated with cardiovascular disease in high-risk individuals. Whether incremental increases in urinary albumin excretion, even within the normal range, are associated with the development of hypertension in low-risk individuals is unknown. This study included 1065 postmenopausal women from the first Nurses' Health Study and 1114 premenopausal women from the second Nurses' Health Study who had an albumin/creatinine ratio < 25 mg/g and who did not have diabetes or hypertension. Among the older women, 271 incident cases of hypertension occurred during 4 yr of follow-up, and among the younger women, 296 incident cases of hypertension occurred during 8 yr of follow-up. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to examine prospectively the association between the albumin/creatinine ratio and incident hypertension after adjustment for age, body mass index, estimated GFR, baseline BP, physical activity, smoking, and family history of hypertension. Participants who had an albumin/creatinine ratio in the highest quartile (4.34 to 24.17 mg/g for older women and 3.68 to 23.84 mg/g for younger women) were more likely to develop hypertension than those who had an albumin/creatinine ratio in the lowest quartile (hazard ratio 1.76 [95% confidence interval 1.21 to 2.56] and hazard ratio 1.35 [95% confidence interval 0.97 to 1.91] for older and younger women, respectively). Higher albumin/creatinine ratios, even within the normal range, are independently associated with increased risk for development of hypertension among women without diabetes. The definition of normal albumin excretion should be reevaluated.

### The C-reactive protein combination ratios outperform the albumin-globulin ratio in diagnosing periprosthetic joint infection after total knee arthroplasty [^38b35538]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Obtaining an accurate preoperative diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infections (PJI) is challenging, making differentiating between septic and aseptic failures difficult. We sought to identify the value of common serum biomarkers and evaluate the accuracy of three ratios in the diagnosis of PJI after primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA): albumin-globulin ratio (AGR), C-reactive protein-albumin ratio (CAR), and C-reactive protein-AGR ratio (CAGR).

Methods

Patients undergoing PJI and aseptic revisions after TKA between 2011 and 2021 were retrospectively reviewed at a single institution. Only patients who had reported serum white blood cell (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), albumin (Alb), and total protein (TP) were included. Areas under the curve (AUCs), which optimize diagnostic performance by balancing sensitivity and specificity at a specific cutoff, were calculated for each individual biomarker and the three ratio groups: AGR = Alb / [TP - Alb], CAR = CRP / Alb, and CAGR = CRP / AGR). Higher AUCs indicate improved identification of PJI while reducing misclassification.

Results

Out of the 126 included cases, 89 were confirmed PJIs and 37 were aseptic revisions. Among the single and combination serum biomarkers, the AUCs were as follows: CRP (0.85), ESR (0.76), Alb (0.81), AGR (0.78), CAR (0.87), and CAGR (0.87). The CAR demonstrated excellent accuracy at a cutoff of 2.46, with a sensitivity of 0.74 and specificity of 0.84. CAGR also demonstrated excellent accuracy at a cutoff of 7.09, with a sensitivity of 0.80 and specificity of 0.78.

Conclusion

The CRP, CAR, and CAGR showed an excellent diagnostic accuracy as markers for PJI. In patients undergoing revision TKA, common serum biomarkers such as Alb, TP, CRP, and ESR can be obtained, and CAR or CAGR ratios can be calculated to aid in the diagnosis of PJI, especially in cases where synovial analysis is inconclusive, allowing for better clinical decision-making.

### Association between serum albumin to creatinine ratio and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a longitudinal cohort study in non-obese Chinese individuals [^3c225d61]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Variables

Serum albumin to creatinine ratio

sACR was calculated as the ratio of ALB (g/L) to Scr (mg/dL) measured at baseline. Both ALB and Scr were measured using standard laboratory methods. We analyzed sACR as a continuous variable and also categorized it into quartiles for sensitivity analyses.

Outcome measures

NAFLD was diagnosed via ultrasound examination following the Chinese Liver Disease Association guidelines. Specifically, diagnosis required meeting these ultrasonographic findings (1) diffuse enhancement of proximal hepatic echoes with progressive distal attenuation; (2) blurred visualization of intrahepatic structures; (3) enlarged liver with rounded margins; (4) reduced hepatic blood flow signals; (5) obscured visibility of the right lobe and diaphragmatic outline.

Participants underwent yearly follow-up assessments with liver ultrasonography conducted by skilled radiologists blinded to participants' medical history and laboratory findings. Participants were censored when either NAFLD was detected or at the last visit, whichever occurred first. The follow-up continued for a 5-year duration.

Covariates

Study covariates were determined through clinical insights and published research findings. The analysis incorporated these covariates: (1) continuous variables: age, anthropometric measurement (BMI), cardiovascular parameters (systolic blood pressure(SBP), diastolic blood pressure(DBP)), liver function indicators (alanine aminotransferase(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin (ALB), globulin (GLB), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), direct bilirubin(DBIL), total bilirubin(TB), alkaline phosphatase (ALP)), lipid profile markers (LDL-c, HDL-c, TG, TC), renal function parameters (Scr, uric acid (UA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN)), and glucose metabolism indicator (fasting plasma glucose (FPG)); (2) categorical variables: gender.

Biochemical parameters were assessed via Abbott AxSYM automated analyzer following standard protocols. A physician Physicians documented health habits and medical history. We calculated BMI as weight(kg)/height² (m²) and determined eGFR using the CKD-EPI equation adjusted for Asian populations. All measurements adhered to standardized collection and processing methods Clinical definitions followed established guidelines: impaired fasting glucose (IFG) as FPG of 6.1–6.9 mmol/L, FPG ≥ 7mmol/L as diabetes, ALT > 40 U/L reflected liver dysfunction, hypertriglyceridemia (HTG) as TG ≥ 1.7 mmol/l, CKD as eGFR < 60mL/min/1.73m². More specific details were presented in the previous reports.

NLR and LMR could not discriminate patients based on their outcome: ROC analysis for NLR (AUC 0.582, 95%CI 0.493–0.668), LMR (AUC 0.629, 95%CI 0.540–0.712), gamma globulins (AUC 0.509, 95%CI 0.420–0.597). Using the proposed cutoff of 1.9 for LMR we found that patients with LMR > 1.9 presented significantly better renal function, based on true GFR (80 ± 34 vs. 64 ± 33 mL/min, P = 0.004) and creatinine levels (0.84 [0.1–1.8] vs. 0.98 [0.59–3.3] mg/dL, P = 0.001). They had lower CTP score (7 vs. 9, P < 0.001) and MELD score (12 [-28] vs. 15 [-33], P = 0.006), NLR (2.3 [0.76–6.81] vs. 4.8 [1.44–15], P < 0.001) and CAR values (1.52 [0.15–62] vs. 3.9 [0.62–19], P < 0.001). Moreover, we verified a positive association between LMR and true GFR (Spearman's ρ: 0.335, P < 0.001). Survival analysis did not detect different times (log rank P = 0.312).

Comparing factors in prognosticating patients' mortality

We conducted ROC analysis to compare MELD and CTP score with the herein introduced inflammatory factors CAR, NLR, LMR and gamma globulins. MELD and CTP scores were superior compared to all these new markers in predicting mortality: MELD (AUC 0.814) and CTP (AUC 0.752) (P-values for all comparisons with the other inflammatory markers < 0.05) (Fig. 3).

### Evaluation of serum albumin and globulin in combination with C-reactive protein improves serum diagnostic accuracy for low-grade periprosthetic joint infection [^82d889ff]. The Journal of Arthroplasty (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Serum immune markers can be useful in the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) by detecting long-lasting abnormal immunological conditions. The purpose of this study was to examine whether serum immune markers can improve the diagnostic accuracy of PJI.

Methods

We enrolled 51 PJI, 45 aseptic loosening, and 334 osteoarthritis patients for assessment of the discriminatory accuracy of serum markers including white blood cell count, C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and D-dimer, total protein, albumin (Alb), globulin (Glb), neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio, lymphocyte-monocyte ratio, platelet-lymphocyte ratio, albumin-globulin ratio (AGR), CRP-albumin ratio (CAR), and CRP-AGR ratio (CAGR). These diagnostic accuracies for low-grade PJI were also calculated in patients who had serum CRP levels < 10 mg/L.

Results

Among serum markers, Alb, Glb, AGR, CRP, ESR, CAR, and CAGR had highly accurate diagnostic accuracy for PJI, with area under the curve of 0.92, 0.90, 0.96, 0.97, 0.92, 0.97, and 0.98, respectively. In low-grade PJI patients, area under the curve of CRP, ESR, CAR, and CAGR (0.69, 0.80, 0.65, and 0.82, respectively) was decreased but that of Alb, Glb, and AGR (0.90, 0.88, and 0.95, respectively) remained high, indicating the diagnostic utility of these immune markers. The sensitivity and specificity of AGR with cutoff value of 1.1 were demonstrated as 0.92 and 0.89, respectively, and with cutoff value of 1.2, 1.00, and 0.79, respectively, in the diagnosis of low-grade infection.

Conclusion

Our results demonstrate the potential value of Alb, Glb, AGR, and combination indices of these immune makers with CRP in improving preoperative serum diagnosis for PJI, especially in low-grade PJI.

Albuminuria and proteinuria assessment in HIV-infected persons — detection of albuminuria or proteinuria is the most common method of detecting kidney damage, and KDIGO guidelines recommend albuminuria as the preferred marker for staging CKD. Urine dipstick provides a semiquantitative measure but can substantially underestimate or overestimate true protein excretion depending on hydration status. Twenty-four–hour urine collections are the reference standard for measuring urinary excretion of albumin or protein; the adequacy of a 24-hour collection can be assessed against expected creatinine excretion of 20–25 and 15–20 mg/kg/day in men and women, respectively. The most clinically useful methods for quantifying excretion are the albumin-to-creatinine and the protein-to-creatinine ratios performed on random urine samples; albumin-to-creatinine ratios from random samples (ideally first morning) correlate closely with 24-hour collections. On average, humans excrete approximately 1 g of creatinine in the urine each day, so albumin or protein to creatinine ratios correspond to total daily excretion.

### Menotropins (menopur) [^a8c48a7d]. FDA (2018). Low credibility.

Cases of OHSS are more common, more severe, and more protracted if pregnancy occurs; therefore, women should be assessed for the development of OHSS for at least two weeks after hCG administration.

If serious OHSS occurs, gonadotropins, including hCG, should be stopped and consideration should be given as to whether the woman needs to be hospitalized. Treatment is primarily symptomatic and overall should consist of bed rest, fluid and electrolyte management, and analgesics (if needed). Because the use of diuretics can accentuate the diminished intravascular volume, diuretics should be avoided except in the late phase of resolution as described below. The management of OHSS may be divided into three phases as follows:

Acute Phase:

Management should be directed at preventing hemoconcentration due to loss of intravascular volume to the third space and minimizing the risk of thromboembolic phenomena and kidney damage. Fluid intake and output, weight, hematocrit, serum and urinary electrolytes, urine specific gravity, BUN and creatinine, total proteins with albumin: globulin ratio, coagulation studies, electrocardiogram to monitor for hyperkalemia, and abdominal girth should be thoroughly assessed daily or more often based on the clinical need. Treatment, consisting of limited intravenous fluids, electrolytes, human serum albumin, is intended to normalize electrolytes while maintaining an acceptable but somewhat reduced intravascular volume. Full correction of the intravascular volume deficit may lead to an unacceptable increase in the amount of third space fluid accumulation.
Chronic Phase:

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^82bd5988]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Other plasma proteins have also been promoted as markers of inflammation. C‐reactive protein (CRP) is a true acute‐phase protein rising within 10 hours to plasma levels > 100 mg/L after major surgery or acute sepsis. CRP is present in very low concentrations in healthy individuals but strongly upregulated, stimulated by IL‐6 and NO rising immediately after trauma or infection. There is a close inverse correlation between increases in CRP and decreases in serum albumin levels after 48 hours in well‐resuscitated septic or traumatized patients. Thereafter, CRP drops quickly after 3–4 days to low, but still modestly increased, levels if the proinflammatory phase is successful. 147 In this phase, plasma CRP level is primarily an indicator of the severity of the primary insult, initiating innate immunity to clear tissue debris and microorganisms and their products. 148 Thereafter, in the anti‐inflammatory phase, CRP is neither a precise indicator of the severity of the metabolic response, nor a very precise indicator of whether there is improvement or deterioration of the clinical state. 147 Only in the presence of renewed or unrelenting tissue damage, CRP will steeply increase or remain strongly elevated. Plasma albumin is a constitutive protein, required in health and disease. After an initial steep drop, plasma albumin levels continue to decrease modestly until 3–7 days after operation, when they start to increase slowly in the case of clinical recovery. 4 Normal levels may only be reached after 3–4 months, reflecting the anti‐inflammatory phase promoting wound healing and tissue rebuilding and remodelling.

### Testosterone therapy in men with hypogonadism: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^803c6381]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2018). Medium credibility.

Free testosterone (FT) assessment — indications and methods: Clinicians should measure FT in men who have conditions that alter sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) and should also measure FT when serum total testosterone (TT) is modestly above or below the lower limit of normal (e.g., 200 to 400 ng/dL); in men with TT far below normal (e.g., < 150 ng/dL), measuring FT is generally not necessary. Local laboratories usually do not have accurate and reliable assays for FT measurement; therefore, clinicians should use a reliable reference laboratory. Clinicians should measure FT using the equilibrium dialysis method performed under standardized conditions; if equilibrium dialysis is not available, clinicians should estimate FT using a formula that calculates FT from TT, SHBG, and albumin concentrations. Direct tracer analog immunoassays for FT are inaccurate and should not be used.

KDIGO 2024 CKD — analytical considerations for albumin and total protein testing: In health, urine albumin losses are small (" < 30 mg/24 hours"). The guideline notes "There is evidence that urinary albumin is a more sensitive test to enable the detection of glomerular pathology associated with some other systemic diseases including diabetes, hypertension, and systemic sclerosis". It cautions that "Total protein measurement is problematic in urine due to imprecision and insensitivity at low concentrations — relatively large increases in urine albumin loss can occur without causing significant measurable increase in urinary total protein", that "Most laboratories currently use either turbidimetry or colorimetry to measure total protein", and that "There is no reference measurement procedure and no standardized reference material for urinary total protein measurement (https://jctlm.org/)".

Point-of-care testing (POCT) diagnostic performance for urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio (PCR) is summarized as follows: studies addressed measurement bias (n = 1), analytical variability (n = 5), analytical sensitivity (n = 2), and analytical specificity (n = 63). Specificity ranged from 17.5 to 99.5 when ACR ≥ 30 mg/g and 30.0–98.7 when ACR ≥ 300 mg/g; for PCR, specificity ranged from 80.8–96.9 when PCR ≥ 200 mg/g and 75.6–95.2 when PCR > 500 mg/g. Given cost-effectiveness, availability without laboratory studies, and acceptable test performance, the Work Group judged that in specific clinical scenarios, POCT should be used.

### Studies on the clinical significance of the serum proteins… [^c6606365]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Denis1 in 1856 was probably the first to report an investigation of the action of various salts on the separation of serum albumin from serum globulin. Hammerstein2 in 1878 reported the utilization of the precipitating effect of salt for the quantitative estimation of the albumin and the globulin in horse and human serum. In 1882 Burckhardt3 found that in starving dogs the albumin concentration of the serum fell while the globulin concentration remained stationary. In 1912 Epstein4 reported that in 12 patients with "nephrosis" the only constant deviation from normal in the serum protein was the lowering of albumin. The absolute globulin level remained essentially constant. He expressed his findings as an albumin-globulin ratio, and since his report this relative method of expression has become deeply rooted in medical literature. It should be noted, however, that when the albuminglobulin ratio is thus reversed, reporting. KAGAN BM.

2 Pain scores: 0 = none; 1 = minimal; 2 = mild; 3 = moderate; 4 = marked

None of the horses developed clinical signs of increased pain, lameness, or swelling after injection at any time point for the 28 days of the study. Values for circumference (swelling) were variable and did not change consistently in any horse. Joint fluid analyses demonstrated a mild to moderate transudative synovitis that returned to within normal baseline values after Day 3 (Table 7). Little alteration occurred in synovial fluid albumin and globulin, and values remained below reported normal for joint fluid (1.2 and < 3.3 g/dL, respectively). Synovial fluid inflammatory cytokine Il-1 values were greater at baseline in OA horses than in our normal horses (Table 2), such that the starting average Il-1ra/Il-1 ratio was 0.3 (fractional and undesirable), and lower than the approximately even ratio (0.95) in our normal horses. After injection of UC in these OA joints, synovial fluid Il-1ra spiked as in the normal horses, such that the Il-1ra/Il-1 ratio was converted to > fourfold and was greater than C. (Table 7). Similarly, anti-inflammatory mediators Il-10, HA, and VEGF were increased and greater than baseline and controls. Serum amyloid A did not detect systemic inflammation caused by UC in horses with OA or desmitis and tendonitis. Digital radiography for carpi and digital ultrasound of the affected forelimb flexor tendons and suspensory ligaments were compared before treatment to study termination (Day 28) without changes noted over the course of the study. Hematology and serum chemistry were within acceptable limits at baseline and at the end of the study.

### Elevated serum globulin fraction as a biomarker of multiyear disease severity in inflammatory bowel disease [^9ead337f]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Results

Study cohort

There were 1767 IBD patients with 4 years of clinical follow up who had an assessment of serum globulin and these patients formed the study population. The median number of times a globulin fraction was checked per patient was 7 (IQR 3–14). Amongst these IBD patients, the majority of participants were female (53.5%) and the mean age was 48.4 ± 15.1 years. Over half of the participants (65.4%) had CD, while 34.5% had UC. Among the study participants, 446 (25.2%) patients had an elevated globulin fraction at the start of the defined study time period and these patients formed the high (i.e. elevated) globulin fraction group, while the remaining patients comprised the normal globulin fraction group.

High globulin fraction group

IBD patients in the high globulin fraction group were more likely to be female (P = 0.004) and to have undergone prior IBD-related surgery (P < 0.001), as demonstrated in Table 1. At the time of the initial test, there was no difference in disease duration between patients with a high globulin fraction and those with a normal globulin fraction. Regarding other biomarkers of disease activity checked on the initial visit, patients with a high globulin fraction had significantly higher CRP, ESR, anemia, and hypoalbuminemia than the patients without globulin elevation. Table 1 displays the differences in patient demographics and disease characteristics between patients with a high globulin fraction and their controls.shows the disease location in these patients, using the Montreal classification.

Commentary and clinical utility — preferred measures and quality assurance: Given the superior precision and sensitivity of assays for urine albumin compared with urine protein, the Work Group agrees with UACR as the preferred method for assessing albuminuria in adults, whereas the urinary protein-creatinine ratio (UPCR) is a preferred initial approach for CKD detection in children. The Work Group agrees with the need for standardized quality assessment for UACR (and UPCR) across health systems and supports working toward quality assurance practices with clinical laboratory adoption of certified reference materials for urine albumin, noting that the variability in urine albumin measurements across methods and clinical laboratories has been well-recognized.

### The relationship between urinary albumin to creatinine ratio and all-cause mortality in the elderly population in the Chinese community: a 10-year follow-up study [^a22e1c19]. BMC Nephrology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

In patients with diabetes and hypertension, proteinuria is independently associated with all-cause death. However, in the general population, urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR) is less used to predict all-cause mortality. When the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio is within the normal range (UACR < 30mg/g), the clinical relevance of an increased urinary albumin excretion rate is still debated. We studied the relationship between UACR and all-cause mortality in community populations, and compared UACR groups within the normal range.

Methods

The participants were the inhabitants from the Wanshoulu community in Beijing, China. The average age is 71.48years, and the proportion of women is 60.1%. A total of 2148 people completed random urine samples to determine the urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR). The subjects were divided into three groups according to UACR: Group 1 (UACR < 10mg/g), Group 2 (10mg/g < UACR < 30mg/g), Group 3 (UACR > 30mg/g). We used Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression model to verify the relationship between UACR and all-cause mortality.

Results

At an average follow-up of 9.87years (718,407.3years), the total mortality rate were 183.4/1000. In the Cox proportional hazards model, after adjusting for possible confounders, those with normal high-value UACR (group 2) showed a higher all-cause mortality than those with normal low-value UACR (group 1) [hazard ratio (HR) 1.289, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.002~1.659 for all-cause mortality]. Those with proteinuria (group 3) showed a higher all-cause mortality than those with normal low-value UACR (group 1) [hazard ratio (HR) 1.394, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.020~1.905 for all-cause mortality].

Conclusion

Urinary albumin to creatinine ratio is an important risk factor for all-cause death in community population. Even if it is within the normal range (UACR < 30mg/g), it occurs in people with high normal value (10mg/g < UACR < 30mg/g), the risk of all-cause death will also increase.
