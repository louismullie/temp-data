## Question

Can valacyclovir cure giant cell arteritis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether valacyclovir can cure giant cell arteritis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what valacyclovir does pharmacologically and what GCA is pathobiologically. Then, I should verify current guideline-endorsed standards of care for GCA. Next, I will need to check whether any clinical trials or guideline recommendations support valacyclovir in GCA. After that, I will review the varicella-zoster virus hypothesis and see if it changes management. Finally, I will consider proven steroid-sparing options and synthesize a risk–benefit conclusion with clear clinical guidance.

> Let me first confirm the agents and disease mechanisms. Valacyclovir is a prodrug of acyclovir that inhibits viral DNA polymerase; it is antiviral and not immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory in a way that would target T cell–macrophage granulomatous vasculitis, which is central to GCA pathogenesis, making a mechanistic cure implausible on its own. GCA is driven by dendritic cell activation with Th1/Th17 responses (e.g. IFN-γ, IL-6) leading to granulomatous inflammation and intimal hyperplasia causing ischemic complications, especially vision loss; this biology typically requires rapid immunosuppression rather than antiviral monotherapy [^113Waz8t].

> I should confirm the standard of care before considering off-path interventions. Multiple high-credibility guidelines recommend immediate high-dose corticosteroids for active GCA, with IV pulse methylprednisolone for threatened vision loss, followed by a structured taper; tocilizumab is recommended as an adjunct in selected patients to reduce relapses and glucocorticoid exposure [^1161347i] [^112Peyqv] [^112mZKSV] [^116DJKEh] [^112xNnWk]. In cerebrovascular presentations, neurology guidelines similarly emphasize urgent initiation of high-dose corticosteroids to mitigate recurrent ischemia risk [^111V74Ew].

> Wait, let me verify whether any guideline even mentions valacyclovir for GCA. I need to check EULAR, ACR/VF, and BSR documents. Hold on, I should verify again: there are no recommendations for valacyclovir or any antiviral to treat GCA itself, and I do not see any randomized or prospective studies of valacyclovir in GCA; the only relevant clinical signal is a case report where valacyclovir was used to treat disseminated VZV in a patient with GCA on immunosuppression, not to treat the vasculitis [^112mZKSV] [^112w6dCE] [^112xNnWk] [^112en6ui].

> Next, I should review the VZV–GCA hypothesis. Some observational and pathology studies detect VZV antigen or DNA in temporal arteries and speculate that VZV might trigger GCA, proposing that antivirals could help; but hold on, let's not jump to conclusions, because these are hypothesis-generating and not clinical efficacy trials demonstrating remission induction or steroid sparing from valacyclovir in GCA patients [^115PtdLF] [^112SMx9s] [^1127saWr]. I should double-check that these reports have not translated into guideline recommendations or randomized data — indeed, they have not [^112mZKSV] [^1161347i].

> I will now examine the mechanistic fit. Even if VZV were a trigger, the downstream autoimmune cascade in GCA becomes self-sustaining; antivirals that block viral DNA replication would not reverse established T cell–macrophage granulomatous vasculitis or intimal remodeling, so immunomodulation remains essential; this lines up with the consistent need for steroids and biologic immunomodulators in trials and practice [^112nnBrM] [^113Waz8t]. Let me reconsider whether any antiviral has demonstrated disease-modifying effects in GCA; I should confirm that none have in controlled studies, which remains the case [^112mZKSV] [^1161347i].

> Next, I should review proven steroid-sparing options to contextualize alternatives. Tocilizumab reduces relapses and glucocorticoid exposure in new-onset and relapsing GCA, as shown in GiACTA and extension data, and is endorsed by guidelines for selected patients; abatacept has modest randomized evidence in prolonging remission; and JAK inhibition has now shown efficacy in phase 3 [^111pp9SV] [^116LgqsF] [^116DJKEh] [^115bkQYT]. Hmm, wait a minute — upadacitinib was investigational in earlier discussions; hold on, I should verify the most recent status — per the NEJM phase 3 trial and the 2025 FDA label, upadacitinib 15 mg daily improved sustained remission and is now approved for GCA with a defined steroid-taper protocol, which updates the therapeutic landscape [^111dYpqd] [^113ri5U6].

> But wait, what if someone delays immunosuppression to try antivirals? I need to ensure we emphasize the clinical risk: deferring high-dose corticosteroids in active GCA increases the chance of irreversible vision loss and cerebrovascular events, and guidelines advise immediate treatment while diagnostic work-up proceeds, especially with ocular involvement [^112nnBrM] [^111V74Ew] [^113edRx5]. I should confirm that antivirals are appropriate only for documented VZV disease in immunosuppressed patients, as in the case report, and not as primary GCA therapy [^112en6ui].

> Synthesizing this, I should be precise. No, valacyclovir cannot cure giant cell arteritis; there is no credible clinical evidence supporting its use as treatment for GCA, and major guidelines do not recommend antivirals for disease control, whereas high-dose corticosteroids with guideline-directed tapering and proven steroid-sparing agents such as tocilizumab or upadacitinib are the standards for inducing and maintaining remission; antivirals are reserved for treating concomitant VZV infection and should not delay immunosuppression in active GCA [^112mZKSV] [^1161347i] [^112xNnWk] [^111pp9SV] [^111dYpqd] [^113ri5U6] [^112en6ui].

Valacyclovir **does not cure** giant cell arteritis (GCA). GCA is an **autoimmune large-vessel vasculitis** [^112nnBrM] driven by immune-mediated inflammation, not by herpesviruses. Valacyclovir is an antiviral for herpesviruses and has **no proven effect** on GCA pathogenesis or outcomes. The standard of care remains immediate **high-dose corticosteroids** [^112mZKSV], with tocilizumab [^116DJKEh] or methotrexate [^114LYj2i] as steroid-sparing options. There is **no clinical evidence or guideline support** for valacyclovir in GCA, and it should not be used for this purpose.

---

## Pathophysiology of giant cell arteritis

GCA is characterized by **granulomatous inflammation** of large- and medium-sized arteries, especially the temporal arteries and branches of the aorta [^112nnBrM]. The disease is driven by immune-mediated mechanisms, including:

- **Activation of vascular dendritic cells**: Initiates recruitment of CD4+ T cells and macrophages, leading to granulomatous inflammation [^112nnBrM].

- **Cytokine production**: Excessive production of cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) drives systemic inflammation and vascular injury [^113Waz8t].

- **Intimal hyperplasia and luminal occlusion**: Immune injury leads to hyperplasia of the intima, causing luminal occlusion and ischemic complications [^113Waz8t].

No **established evidence** supports a causal role for herpesviruses, such as varicella-zoster virus (VZV) or herpes simplex virus (HSV), in GCA pathogenesis [^1112neLV]. Although some studies have detected VZV antigen in temporal artery biopsies, these findings are controversial and not universally accepted [^112SMx9s].

---

## Mechanism of action of valacyclovir

Valacyclovir is an antiviral that **inhibits viral DNA polymerase**, preventing viral replication. It is used primarily for herpesvirus infections, including HSV and VZV. Valacyclovir has no meaningful immunomodulatory effects or direct anti-inflammatory properties relevant to autoimmune diseases such as GCA.

---

## Clinical evidence regarding valacyclovir in GCA

The medical literature contains **no clinical trials**, case reports, or observational studies demonstrating valacyclovir's efficacy in treating GCA [^111JEoyb]. The only related evidence consists of isolated case reports of herpes zoster-associated temporal artery vasculitis, a distinct entity from GCA [^1127saWr]. In these cases, antivirals were used to treat the underlying viral infection rather than the autoimmune vasculitis characteristic of GCA.

---

## Current standard of care for GCA

The standard of care for GCA is **immediate initiation** of high-dose corticosteroids [^111V74Ew] to prevent irreversible complications, such as vision loss [^113edRx5]. Corticosteroids are the cornerstone of therapy, with adjunctive immunosuppressive agents considered in specific scenarios:

- **Corticosteroids**: High-dose prednisone (40–60 mg/day) is recommended for induction of remission [^112mZKSV] [^1161347i].

- **Tocilizumab**: An IL-6 receptor antagonist, recommended as adjunctive therapy in patients with refractory or relapsing disease, or those at high risk of corticosteroid-related adverse effects [^116LgqsF] [^117PqAYN].

- **Methotrexate**: Considered as an alternative immunosuppressive agent in patients with active extracranial large vessel involvement [^114LYj2i] [^117YG7ry].

Current clinical guidelines **do not include antiviral therapy**, including valacyclovir, for the management of GCA [^114LYj2i].

---

## Potential risks and side effects of valacyclovir in GCA patients

Valacyclovir is generally well-tolerated, but it can cause side effects such as gastrointestinal disturbances, headache, and rare hypersensitivity reactions. In immunocompromised patients, including those receiving corticosteroids for GCA, antiviral therapy may increase the **risk of renal impairment** and other complications. However, these risks are not specifically documented in GCA because valacyclovir is not a standard treatment for this condition.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Valacyclovir **does not cure** giant cell arteritis. There is **no scientific or guideline support** for using valacyclovir to treat GCA. GCA is primarily immune-mediated; antiviral therapy targeting herpesviruses is not relevant to its disease mechanisms. The **standard of care remains corticosteroids**, with adjunctive immunosuppressive therapy as indicated [^112mZKSV].

Overall, in our patients, GC therapy was started from 5 days to 3 weeks after the appearance of clinical symptoms. In 11 patients, not even a partial recovery of visual acuity was achieved. These observations highlight the urgency of early treatment to prevent the involvement of the contralateral eye and possibly to impede further worsening of visual acuity in the affected eye. However, GCs are of poor (if any) efficacy in appreciably improving the vision of patients who have already developed ophthalmic GCA, especially in terms of visual field recovery.

GCs were slowly tapered on an individual basis, taking into account the mitigation of signs and symptoms and the reduction or normalization of laboratory features, including ESR, the CRP level, and the platelet count. The length of GC administration ranged from 18 to 36 months. Nonetheless, during GC tapering, 9 out of 56 patients suffered disease relapse (16%), including 4 out of 19 with ophthalmic GCA (21%). In addition, four patients had disease recurrence (none in patients with ophthalmic GCA) 3–6 months following GC withdrawal. Patients with relapse or recurrence were retreated with medium to high doses of GCs that were gradually tapered. Thereafter, these patients were placed on a maintenance regime of indefinite low-dose GCs.

The efficacy and safety of RINVOQ 15 mg once daily were assessed in Trial GCA (NCT03725202), a Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, multicenter, placebo-controlled study in patients 50 years of age and older (81.8% were 65 years of age and older, 73.1% were female, 93.7% were white) with new-onset or relapsing giant cell arteritis. Trial GCA was a 52-week trial in which 428 patients were randomized in a 2:1:1 ratio and dosed once daily with RINVOQ 15 mg, upadacitinib 7.5 mg, or placebo. All patients received background corticosteroid therapy. The RINVOQ and upadacitinib-treated groups followed a pre-specified corticosteroid taper regimen with the aim to reach 0 mg by 26 weeks, while the placebo-treated group followed a pre-specified corticosteroid taper regimen with the aim to reach 0 mg by 52 weeks. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving sustained remission at Week 52, as defined by the absence of giant cell arteritis signs and symptoms from Week 12 through Week 52 and adherence to the protocol-defined corticosteroid taper regimen.

A key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving sustained complete remission at Week 52, as defined by the absence of giant cell arteritis signs and symptoms from Week 12 through Week 52, normalization of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and hsCRP from Week 12 through Week 52, and adherence to the protocol-defined corticosteroid taper regimen. The study included a 52-week extension for a total study duration of up to 2 years.

### Giant cell arteritis: The experience of two collaborative referral centers and an overview of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic advancements [^1145v2LZ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

With the aim of targeting the immune abnormalities underlying both the extravascular and vasculogenic components of GCA, many different therapeutic agents have been proposed, including immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, leflunomide, and mycophenolate mofetil, along with TNF-α inhibitors like infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept, abatacept, and rituximab. A survey of the results achieved with their administration, mostly in patients with difficult-to-treat GCA and in small series, can be found in recent reviews.

While the overall results of treatment have been disappointing, an encouraging exception is biologic therapy using TCZ, shown in a trial setting to be effective in the induction and maintenance of remission in GCA patients. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 trial (GiACTA trial), TCZ combined with a 26-week prednisone taper was shown to be significantly superior to either 26-week or 52-week prednisone tapering plus placebo, in terms of sustained GCs-free remission. Furthermore, when TCZ was included as add-on therapy to GCs during the first 3 months of treatment, at week 26, the primary endpoint of remaining in remission with ≤ 0.1 mg prednisone/kg/day was met by 75% of the patients, although half experienced relapse during the 9 months following TCZ discontinuation. Finally, in an observational, retrospective, multicenter study carried out on patients with GCA refractory to conventional therapy, 94% achieved prompt and persistent clinical improvement one month after TCZ introduction. Infections were the most common adverse event.

### Evidence on treat to target strategies in polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis: a systematic literature review [^113PeGuq]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

We did not identify a study testing a treat-to-target (T2T) strategy in polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and/or giant cell arteritis (GCA). An obstacle to conducting such a trial might be the absence of internationally recognized remission criteria, which have been defined as the most relevant target for these diseases. Optimally, PMR and GCA trials adopting a T2T approach may be important for individualizing treatment, reducing side effects, and enhancing quality of life. Frequent monitoring aids in the early detection of flares, enabling timely intervention to prevent severe exacerbations. Moreover, this approach would foster standardized care, gather valuable research data, and support evidence-based decision-making, ultimately leading to improved long-term outcomes. Furthermore, the utilization of a T2T strategy calls for the introduction of new therapeutic interventions targeting individuals who exhibit limited responsiveness to the initial treatment regimen. We anticipate that this systematic literature review (SLR) and the T2T recommendations will stimulate further research in this regard.

We did not include studies without a control group in our SLR, which might be seen as a limitation; however, our objective was to identify targets and outcomes that might be valuable for a T2T strategy. Studies without an intervention were therefore considered less relevant for our purpose. Titles and abstract screening were performed by different fellows than data extraction and quality assessment; this is certainly not the standard approach and was a consequence of changed duties and personal developments during the COVID-19 crisis. However, every step was conducted under supervision.

### Giant-cell arteritis and polymyalgia rheumatica [^113Waz8t]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2003). Low credibility.

Giant-cell arteritis is an immune-mediated disease characterized by granulomatous infiltrates in the wall of medium-sized and large arteries. The immunopathology consists of two components. Excessive cytokine production (for example, interleukin-1 and interleukin-6) induces systemic inflammation with an exuberant acute-phase response. In parallel, interferon-gamma, which is released by T cells captured in the arterial wall, activates tissue-injurious macrophages. In response to the immune injury, the artery generates hyperplasia of the intima that leads to luminal occlusion and subsequent tissue ischemia.

Despite the systemic character of the disease, distinct vascular territories are preferentially affected. Based on the predominant involvement, clinical subtypes can be distinguished:

- **Cranial giant-cell arteritis**: Ischemic complications occur in the eye, the face, and the central nervous system.
- **Large-vessel giant-cell arteritis**: Occlusions occur in the subclavian or axillary vessels.
- **Aortic giant-cell arteritis**
- **Giant-cell arteritis presenting as an intense systemic inflammatory syndrome**: Features non-stenosing vasculitis.
- **Isolated polymyalgia rheumatica**: Includes myalgias, systemic inflammation, and subclinical vasculitis.

Temporal artery biopsy remains the diagnostic procedure of choice to detect arteritis in cranial vessels. In other vascular territories, giant-cell arteritis is most commonly diagnosed by vascular imaging. Laboratory studies characteristically document marked elevations of nonspecific acute-phase reactants, such as C-reactive protein and erythrocyte.

### Neck swelling and airway narrowing as an initial manifestation of giant cell arteritis [^111AS2VW]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Giant cell arteritis can result in a wide range of symptoms due to the extensive distribution of the external carotid artery. Face and neck swelling and trismus are under-recognized features of giant cell arteritis and can present as the initial symptoms prior to the development of classical temporal tenderness and jaw claudication. The lack of awareness of these less common symptoms may result in a late diagnosis of giant cell arteritis, leading to irreversible vision loss. In this paper, we present a case of neck swelling and airway narrowing as the initial manifestation of giant cell arteritis.

### Aspirin as adjunctive treatment for giant cell arteritis [^114N7cMb]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a common inflammatory condition that affects medium and large-sized arteries and can lead to sudden, permanent blindness. Currently, there is no alternative to early treatment with high-dose corticosteroids, which is the recommended standard management. However, corticosteroid-induced side effects can develop, and further disease-related ischemic complications may still occur. Therefore, alternative and adjunctive therapies are being sought. Aspirin has been shown to have effects on immune-mediated inflammation in GCA, which may reduce damage to the arterial wall.

- **Objectives**: To assess the safety and effectiveness of low-dose aspirin as an adjunctive treatment in giant cell arteritis (GCA).

- **Search methods**: We searched CENTRAL (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Group Trials Register) (2013, Issue 12), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid MEDLINE In-Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations, Ovid MEDLINE Daily, Ovid OLDMEDLINE (January 1946 to January 2014), EMBASE (January 1980 to January 2014), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS) (January 1982 to January 2014), the metaRegister of Controlled Trials (mRCT) (www.controlled-trials.com), ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov), the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (www.who.int/ictrp/search/en), and the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) website (www.fda.gov). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic searches for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 24 January 2014.

### Risk loci involved in giant cell arteritis susceptibility: a genome-wide association study [^113bNkaC]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

In this study, we explored the genetic basis of giant cell arteritis through the largest GWAS conducted for this type of vasculitis at the time of writing. Our findings substantially increase the understanding of the genetic components contributing to the pathogenesis of giant cell arteritis. We identified three novel genetic risk factors and, through an extensive functional analysis, elucidated their potential biological consequences in giant cell arteritis pathogenesis. Furthermore, our results have clarified the association between HLA and this form of vasculitis, and substantiated the role of another established giant cell arteritis-associated locus, the PLG gene.

To overcome the challenge of identifying the mechanisms underlying loci associated with giant cell arteritis, we conducted a comprehensive functional analysis of the results from the GWAS. This approach led to a considerable reduction in the number of variants that could reliably explain these associations, thus improving our ability to interpret their biological involvement. In the case of the HLA region, we have defined a set of five variants that adequately encompass the observed association within this highly complex region. For non-HLA loci, we identified the most credible causal variants with biological relevance, facilitating a focused analysis of the potential causal genes of these signals.

### Giant cell arteritis: Epidemiological clues to its pathogenesis and an update on its treatment [^1112neLV]. Rheumatology (2003). Low credibility.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a chronic systemic vasculitis with a marked female predominance and is restricted to old age. The disease process distinctly targets large and medium-sized arteries, preferentially the aorta and its extracranial branches. Morphological observations indicate that the age and sex distribution of GCA is related to the occurrence of degenerative changes in the arterial wall.

GCA is not a truly infectious vasculitis; however, an infection might be a triggering factor. Different centers report an increase in GCA incidence, but annual fluctuations have not been shown to be statistically significant. Significant seasonal variations, however, have been observed by several groups. The mortality is not increased in adequately treated patients. Although alternative steroid-sparing agents have been proposed, corticosteroids remain the first treatment choice.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for giant cell arteritis, specifically concerning the management of relapse, the BHPR/BSR 2010 guidelines recommend adjusting corticosteroids in patients with a relapse of GCA as follows:

- **Treat headache recurrence**: Increase the dose of corticosteroids to a previously effective higher level.

- **Treat jaw claudication**: Administer corticosteroids at a dose equivalent to 60 mg prednisolone orally per day.

- **Treat relapse of ocular symptoms**: Use either IV methylprednisolone or oral corticosteroids at a dose equivalent to 60 mg prednisolone.

### Diagnostic accuracy of vascular ultrasound in patients with suspected giant cell arteritis (EUREKA): a prospective, multicentre, non-interventional, cohort study [^1135ke1J]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Temporal artery biopsy is considered the diagnostic gold standard for giant cell arteritis, despite approximately 39% of patients who test negative via biopsy subsequently being given a clinical diagnosis of the condition. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound examination in patients with suspected giant cell arteritis.

- **Methods**: In this prospective, multicentre, non-interventional cohort study (Evaluation of Ultrasound's Role in Patients Suspected of Having Extracranial and Cranial Giant Cell Arteritis; EUREKA), patients aged 50 years or older with clinically suspected giant cell arteritis were consecutively recruited from three Danish hospitals: South West Jutland Hospital in Esbjerg, Silkeborg Regional Hospital, and Rigshospitalet, Glostrup. Participants underwent a bilateral ultrasound of the temporal, facial, common carotid, and axillary arteries. Ultrasounds were performed by ultrasonographers systematically trained in vascular ultrasound, using appropriate equipment and settings. Participants then received a temporal artery biopsy within 7 days of initiating corticosteroid treatment. A blinded ultrasound expert assessed all ultrasound images.

- **Ultrasound vasculitis definition**: In cranial arteries, vasculitis was defined by a homogeneous, hypoechoic intima-media complex thickness with a positive compression sign. In axillary arteries, it was defined as a homogeneous intima-media complex 1 mm in thickness or wider, and 1.5 mm or wider in the common carotid artery. Participants were followed up at 6 months. During this period, clinical assessments continued to evaluate the diagnostic effectiveness of the ultrasound in comparison to biopsy outcomes.

### Current management of giant cell arteritis and its complications [^111JEoyb]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

This review provides an update on management strategies for giant cell arteritis (GCA), emphasizing the need for alternative therapies to reduce disease relapses and mitigate glucocorticoid (GC)-related morbidity.

Recent findings indicate that the standard of care for GCA has traditionally involved prolonged use of GC. Recent studies are exploring faster GC tapering regimens to reduce adverse effects while maintaining disease control. Randomized clinical trials have highlighted the efficacy of tocilizumab (TCZ), an interleukin-6 receptor inhibitor, in reducing disease flares and sparing GCs. However, the optimal treatment duration with TCZ is unknown, and patients remain at risk of relapse after treatment discontinuation.

There is an unmet therapeutic need for patients who are not candidates for TCZ and for those who have an inadequate response to this biologic. Therefore, investigations into alternative therapies, such as targeting interleukin-17A, blocking T-cell activation, or inhibiting the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription pathway, showcase potential avenues for tailored treatments.

While GCs remain the cornerstone of therapy, TCZ emerges as a promising GC-sparing agent. Ongoing research targeting different pathways implicated in GCA pathogenesis has led to encouraging results. However, the preliminary nature of these findings necessitates larger randomized controlled trials to establish their efficacy conclusively.

### Concurrent central retinal artery occlusion and branch retinal vein occlusion in giant cell arteritis [^116rAL5b]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2010). Low credibility.

Ophthalmic involvement in giant cell arteritis can manifest in a number of ways. Central retinal artery occlusion is one of the common causes of visual loss in giant cell arteritis. In contrast, branch retinal vein occlusion is rarely associated with this condition. We report an 89-year-old lady with acute left central retinal artery occlusion on a background of progressive decline in vision over a 6-month period, accompanied by concurrent branch retinal vein occlusion. Subsequent investigation confirmed giant cell arteritis through temporal artery biopsy. This is the first reported case of concurrent central retinal artery occlusion and branch retinal vein occlusion in giant cell arteritis, highlighting the various ocular presentations that can occur in this disease.

### Successful use of ixekizumab for glucocorticoid-free remission maintenance in giant cell arteritis [^112cZiBp]. Rheumatology (2023). High credibility.

IL-17 blockade with ixekizumab can be a promising steroid-sparing agent in giant cell arteritis (GCA). GCA is a systemic vasculitis that primarily involves large- and medium-size arteries. Glucocorticoids represent the cornerstone of GCA treatment, but their use is associated with significant toxicity. Moreover, patients treated with glucocorticoid monotherapy experience a high relapse rate upon dose reduction or discontinuation. The IL-6 receptor antagonist tocilizumab is the only approved treatment with confirmed efficacy in terms of remission maintenance and glucocorticoid-sparing effect in GCA. However, tocilizumab makes C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) unreliable for monitoring disease activity. Thus, novel effective treatments are under evaluation.

### Disseminated varicella-zoster virus infections following messenger RNA-based COVID-19 vaccination [^112en6ui]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 70-year-old woman with a history of giant cell arteritis and resolved SARS-CoV-2 infection 10 months ago presented with a diffuse erythematous vesicular rash. Eighteen days ago, she completed a 20-week low-dose methylprednisolone taper for giant cell arteritis, initiated at 10 mg daily. Eight days prior to presentation, she received the first dose of the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) COVID-19 vaccine; five days later, a pruritic skin eruption with associated daily fevers developed in her.

The examination demonstrated thin erythematous papules and vesicles over the forehead, trunk, and extremities (Fig 1, C and D). No antecedent dermatomal eruption was noted; notably, the patient had received a live zoster vaccine (Zostavax, Merck) 10 years ago. Dermatopathology demonstrated papillary and mid-dermal lymphocytic infiltrate with admixed neutrophils and foci of lymphocytic vasculitis. Findings of VZV immunohistochemistry were negative; however, findings of polymerase chain reaction from a sampled vesicle were positive for VZV DNA. The patient was initiated on oral valacyclovir 1000 mg three times daily; the following day, she was admitted to the hospital for intravenous acyclovir (10 mg/kg, every 8 hours for 5 days). One week after hospital discharge, she had a near-complete resolution of her infection with diffuse postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. One week after completing valacyclovir and four weeks after her first dose, she received the second vaccine dose without complications.

### Neck swelling and airway narrowing as an initial manifestation of giant cell arteritis [^1138z4vQ]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Giant cell arteritis can result in a wide range of symptoms due to the extensive distribution of the external carotid artery. Face and neck swelling and trismus are under-recognized features of giant cell arteritis and can present as the initial symptoms before the development of classical temporal tenderness and jaw claudication. The lack of awareness of these less common symptoms may result in a late diagnosis of giant cell arteritis, leading to irreversible vision loss. In this paper, we present a case of neck swelling and airway narrowing as the initial manifestation of giant cell arteritis.

### Risk loci involved in giant cell arteritis susceptibility: a genome-wide association study [^113K3dET]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

In this GWAS and meta-analysis of the largest cohort of patients with giant cell arteritis studied at the time of writing, we identified three novel loci associated with giant cell arteritis susceptibility. Through a comprehensive functional analysis, we identified relevant cell types and potential causal variants and prioritized genes involved in angiogenesis and neutrophil extracellular traps. Notably, we pinpointed several potentially repositionable drugs for giant cell arteritis treatment and developed a genetic risk model capable of identifying individuals at high risk of developing giant cell arteritis.

Enhancing our understanding of giant cell arteritis opens up opportunities for uncovering underlying disease mechanisms, thereby potentially advancing the clinical management of individuals with this type of vasculitis. Despite the research efforts invested in the past decade to elucidate the genetic basis of giant cell arteritis, the cause of the condition remains largely unknown, with fewer identified loci associated with disease risk compared to other immune-mediated inflammatory diseases, such as systemic sclerosis and Sjögren's disease. The low prevalence of giant cell arteritis and the high statistical power necessary for genomic studies have imposed limitations on previous research, hindering substantial discoveries.

### Giant-cell arteritis: Do we treat patients with large-vessel involvement differently [^112dqz5H]? The American Journal of Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

We aimed to describe the initial treatment used in a common hospital-based practice for patients with giant-cell arteritis, both with and without large-vessel involvement at diagnosis, and to assess the outcomes in both groups.

This retrospective multi-center cohort included patients with giant-cell arteritis diagnosed between 2005 and 2015, all of whom underwent fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) at diagnosis and were followed for at least 12 months. We compared the features, treatment, and outcomes of patients with large-vessel involvement, demonstrated on FDG-PET/CT, with those of patients with a negative PET/CT.

Eighty patients (50 women, median age: 71 [53–87] years) were included in the study. Of these, 40 had large-vessel involvement demonstrated on FDG-PET/CT, and 40 did not. After a median follow-up time of 56 months, 42 (53%) patients had discontinued glucocorticoid (GC) treatment. Patients with and without large-vessel involvement were indistinguishable in terms of the initial median dose of prednisone (0.74 mg/kg vs. 0.75 mg/kg, P = 0.56), overall GC duration (P = 0.77), GC discontinuation rate (P = 0.65), relapse rate (P = 0.50), frequency of GC-dependent disease requiring GC-sparing treatments (P = 0.62), and fatality rate (P = 0.06).

In the setting of tertiary hospital recruitment, large-vessel involvement at giant-cell arteritis diagnosis using a PET/CT study had no influence on the choice of initial GC dose and had no impact on outcomes. Prospective studies are required.

Regarding the medical management of giant cell arteritis, specifically with respect to corticosteroids, the BSR 2020 guidelines recommend tapering the corticosteroid dose to zero over a period of 12 to 18 months, provided there is no return of GCA symptoms, signs, or laboratory markers of inflammation. It is advised to consider reducing the dose more rapidly in patients at high risk of corticosteroid toxicity and/or those receiving concomitant corticosteroid-sparing therapy.

### Tolicizumab effectively controls giant cell arteritis and prevents recurrence of steroid-induced concomitant toxoplasmosis chorioretinitis [^114b9sbk]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) affects various ocular structures and potentially leads to vision loss. Traditional therapy involves a tapering regimen of high-dose systemic corticosteroids, which are associated with adverse effects, including the risk of opportunistic infections such as toxoplasmosis from immune suppression. Tocilizumab, a humanised monoclonal antibody directed against the interleukin-6 receptor, offers an effective treatment option for GCA.

In this report, we detail the successful treatment of GCA-associated, steroid-induced retinochoroiditis toxoplasma chorioretinitis (RTRC) using intravenous tocilizumab. A female patient in her 70s presented with GCA treatment challenges with prednisone, and subsequent complications of RTRC were noted. Twelve months after the initial presentation, the patient was treated with intravenous tocilizumab, leading to rapid resolution of the active lesion. At the 1-year follow-up, the patient maintained 20/20 vision and showed no signs of inflammation or toxoplasmosis reactivation.

This case suggests tocilizumab may be an effective alternative treatment for managing GCA, particularly in cases complicated by RTRC.

### Risk loci involved in giant cell arteritis susceptibility: a genome-wide association study [^113BjzTf]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Giant cell arteritis represents the most common form of vasculitis in Europe and North America and mainly affects individuals aged 50 years and older. This type of large-vessel vasculitis primarily affects the aorta and its branches, resulting in ischemic complications if not promptly treated. Giant cell arteritis not only reduces the quality of life for affected individuals, but also imposes a considerable socioeconomic burden on healthcare systems, given the high costs associated with disease complications (e.g. blindness, cerebrovascular accident, and aortic aneurysms) and glucocorticoid toxicity.

The cause of giant cell arteritis is complex, involving both genetic and environmental factors. Previous attempts to uncover the genetic basis of giant cell arteritis through large-scale genetic approaches led to the identification of two loci associated with the disease, P4HA2 and PLG, and substantiated the crucial involvement of the HLA region in disease susceptibility. The identified signals indicated a genetic contribution of the angiogenesis process in disease pathogenesis, further supporting the proposed role of this mechanism in giant cell arteritis.

- **Research in context**:
	- **Evidence before this study**: Giant cell arteritis is an immune-mediated inflammatory disease with a strong genetic component that remains poorly understood. Our incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis of this chronic large-vessel vasculitis limits our ability to identify new therapeutic targets, biomarkers, and preventive strategies. Previous research has shown that genome-wide studies are essential in uncovering the genetic aspects of the disease.

### Risk loci involved in giant cell arteritis susceptibility: a genome-wide association study [^1122Ub3N]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Giant cell arteritis is an age-related vasculitis that mainly affects the aorta and its branches in individuals aged 50 years and older. Options for diagnosis and treatment are scarce, highlighting the need to better understand its underlying pathogenesis. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have emerged as a powerful tool for unraveling the pathogenic mechanisms involved in complex diseases. We aimed to characterize the genetic basis of giant cell arteritis by performing the largest GWAS of this vasculitis at the time of writing and to assess the functional consequences and clinical implications of identified risk loci.

- **Methods**: We collected and meta-analyzed genomic data from patients with giant cell arteritis and healthy controls of European ancestry from ten cohorts across Europe and North America. Eligible patients required confirmation of giant cell arteritis diagnosis by positive temporal artery biopsy, positive temporal artery Doppler ultrasonography, or imaging techniques confirming large-vessel vasculitis. We assessed the functional consequences of loci associated with giant cell arteritis using cell enrichment analysis, fine-mapping, and causal gene prioritization. We also performed a drug repurposing analysis and developed a polygenic risk score to explore the clinical implications of our findings.

- **Findings**: We included a total of 3,498 patients with giant cell arteritis and 15,550 controls. We identified three novel loci associated with the risk of giant cell arteritis. Two loci, MFGE8 (rs8029053; p = 4.96×10⁻⁸; OR 1.19 [95% CI 1.12–1.26]) and VTN (rs704).

### Giant cell arteritis: Strategies in diagnosis and treatment [^112799E3]. Current Opinion in Rheumatology (2004). Low credibility.

This review summarizes diagnostic assessments and therapeutic strategies in giant cell arteritis. Giant cell arteritis, also known as temporal arteritis, is a chronic vasculitis of large and medium-sized vessels. Symptoms include proximal muscular ache and morning stiffness, commonly associated with polymyalgia rheumatica. Recent investigations support the conjecture that polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis are different expressions of the same underlying vasculitic disorder.

The symptomatology of giant cell arteritis is quite variable. Recent findings have shown a frequent occurrence of audiovestibular manifestations, which should be actively searched for during clinical investigations. Although color Doppler ultrasound, MRI, and positron emission tomography have demonstrated the widespread nature of giant cell arteritis, none of these techniques can currently replace temporal artery biopsy. Biopsy of the superficial temporal artery is a safe and straightforward procedure and remains the gold standard for diagnosing giant cell arteritis. The importance of long biopsies and meticulous histological examination using sub-serial sectioning is emphasized. Many recent publications confirm the low diagnostic yield of a second, contralateral biopsy.

Corticosteroids remain the cornerstone treatment for giant cell arteritis. While steroid treatment promptly eliminates symptoms of systemic inflammation, its effect on inflammatory morphology is delayed. Consequently, there is a need for new therapeutic strategies. The potential role of (the text cuts off here.)

### Giant cell arteritis: Is the clinical spectrum of the disease changing [^112oE7ns]. BMC Geriatrics (2019). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids are the cornerstone of treatment. Some adjuvant therapies, such as methotrexate, have been used as glucocorticoid-sparing agents to minimize their adverse effects, with conflicting results in terms of safety and clinical benefit. It is also recommended to use low-dose aspirin to reduce the risk of associated cardiovascular events. More recently, open-label studies and clinical trials have demonstrated that the use of tocilizumab, a novel humanized monoclonal antibody against IL-6, yields significant efficacy in achieving sustained, corticosteroid-independent remissions.

The aim of this report is to aid physicians in the early recognition of symptoms of GCA, with special emphasis on patients with atypical or extra-cranial manifestations ("occult" GCA), to facilitate appropriate diagnosis, as it is crucial to prevent severe complications.

### Giant cell arteritis: The experience of two collaborative referral centers and an overview of disease pathogenesis and therapeutic advancements [^116Zszvm]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2020). Low credibility.

The treatment of GCA and PMR must take into account the disease course and the associated comorbidities. As noted above, MTX is frequently prescribed in conjunction with GCs, not only as a steroid-sparing therapy but also because of its demonstrated ability to reduce the risk of relapses. It seems, therefore, safe to state that the association of MTX with GCs is justified in both GCA and PMR patients with early relapse while tapering GCs, in those requiring long-term or more than 7.5–10 mg/day of maintenance prednisone equivalents after at least 3 months of sustained GC therapy, and in those experiencing unbearable GC-related side effects.

As mentioned before, the IL-6/IL-17 axis that is mainly responsible for the extravascular inflammatory syndrome of GCA is readily responsive to GCs. Conversely, the IL-12/IFN-γ axis is largely involved in the vascular damage and is poorly responsive to these drugs. To overcome this discrepancy, adjunctive therapies such as aspirin/anticoagulants, hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase inhibitors also known as statins, and angiotensin II receptor blockers commonly defined as sartans have been proposed. However, in the absence of randomized clinical trials, the evidence supporting their usefulness is circumstantial and overall disappointing.

### Assessment of giant cell arteritis-associated visual outcomes at a tertiary hospital in Ontario, Canada [^111nAEyG]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

There are limited data concerning outcomes in those with giant cell arteritis-associated vision changes (GCA, GCAVCs). We estimated the association of intravenous, compared to oral, glucocorticoids with outcomes in GCAVCs.

- **Objective**: We conducted a retrospective cohort study at a tertiary healthcare facility in Ontario, Canada. Individuals aged 50 years or older with an international classification of disease version 10 (ICD-10) diagnostic code for GCA associated with a healthcare visit between November 2017 to December 2023 were identified for inclusion. Diagnoses of GCA were verified as the final diagnosis of the treating clinician and were required to be supported by histologic, radiographic, and/or biochemical evidence of inflammatory vasculopathy. GCAVCs were identified by clinical assessments. Treatment exposures were defined as whether the individual was first exposed to intravenous or oral glucocorticoids. The primary outcome was reported visual improvement after treatment. We used logistic regression to estimate treatment effects adjusting for demographic and disease factors.

- **Results**: In 289 individuals with GCA, 77 (26.6%) had GCAVCs. 70.1% of GCAVCs led to permanent vision loss and visual recovery was seen in 16.0% of participants. We found no difference in outcomes for those first treated with intravenous versus oral glucocorticoids (adjusted odds ratios 0.43–1.72, 95% confidence interval range 0.02–123.68).

- **Conclusion**: GCAVCs are common and frequently associated with permanent vision loss. While the precision of our results was limited by sample size, they provide valuable insights into the treatment outcomes for GCA-associated vision changes.

### The use of intravenous methylprednisolone in giant cell arteritis: A population-based study [^111ywLbe]. Rheumatology (2025). Low credibility.

**Rheumatology key messages**: Compared to those receiving only oral glucocorticoids, patients with giant cell arteritis (GCA) treated with initial intravenous methylprednisolone (IVMP) (i) have a higher first-year incidence of diabetes mellitus; and (ii) do not show better recovery of visual acuity. Initial IVMP does not allow a more rapid tapering of oral glucocorticoid dose.

### Large vessel giant cell arteritis [^112hS23Q]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

Giant cell arteritis is the principal form of systemic vasculitis affecting people over 50. Large-vessel involvement, termed large vessel giant cell arteritis, mainly affects the aorta and its branches and often occurs alongside cranial giant cell arteritis. However, large vessel giant cell arteritis without cranial involvement can also occur. Patients mostly present with constitutional symptoms, with localized symptoms present in only a minority of cases.

Large vessel giant cell arteritis is usually overlooked until clinicians seek to exclude it with imaging techniques such as ultrasonography, magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), computed tomography angiography (CTA), or [18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose-PET-CT. Although the role of imaging in treatment monitoring remains uncertain, imaging by MRA or CTA is crucial for identifying aortic aneurysm formation during patient follow-up. In this series paper, we define the large vessel subset of giant cell arteritis and summarize its clinical challenges. Furthermore, we identify areas for future research regarding the management of large vessel giant cell arteritis.

### New-onset versus relapsing giant cell arteritis treated with tocilizumab: 3-year results from a randomized controlled trial and extension [^111pp9SV]. Rheumatology (2022). High credibility.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is an inflammatory disorder associated with vascular and inflammatory symptoms, including headache, jaw claudication, fever, weight loss, and visual disturbances that can lead to irreversible blindness. To minimize these consequences, patients with GCA are commonly treated with high-dose glucocorticoids. These are initially effective for symptom management but may not be sufficient to prevent disease flares at lower doses. Up to 80% of patients experience disease flares over the course of one year if glucocorticoids are tapered completely, and the flare rate is between 35% and 75% even if patients continue on some dose of prednisone while in remission. Many patients require additional prednisone to treat flares or refractory symptoms. However, prolonged glucocorticoid use is associated with significant toxicity. Given that GCA occurs almost exclusively in older adults, with a peak incidence occurring between 71 and 80 years, the potential for glucocorticoid toxicity is especially concerning.

The IL-6 receptor alpha inhibitor tocilizumab was approved for the treatment of patients with GCA, based on positive results from the Giant-Cell Arteritis Actemra (GiACTA) trial. GiACTA was a two-part, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicentre phase 3 study of patients with either new-onset or relapsing GCA. Part 1 consisted of a 52-week double-blind period. This was followed by a 104-week open-label phase (part 2). In part 1, tocilizumab administered weekly or every other week in combination with prednisone taper was superior to placebo plus prednisone taper at inducing remission.

### Pan American League of Associations for Rheumatology guidelines for the treatment of giant cell arteritis [^115RBwzu]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2022). Low credibility.

Considerable variability exists in the way that healthcare providers treat patients with giant cell arteritis in Latin America, with patients commonly exposed to excessive amounts of glucocorticoids. In addition, large health disparities prevail in this region due to socioeconomic factors, which influence access to care, including biological treatments. For these reasons, the Pan American League of Associations for Rheumatology developed the first evidence-based giant cell arteritis treatment guidelines tailored for Latin America.

A panel of vasculitis experts from Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Brazil, and Argentina generated clinically meaningful questions related to the treatment of giant cell arteritis in the population, intervention, comparator, and outcome (PICO) format. Following the grading of recommendations, assessment, development, and evaluation methodology, a team of methodologists conducted a systematic literature search, extracted and summarized the effects of the interventions, and graded the quality of the evidence. The panel of vasculitis experts voted on each PICO question and made recommendations, which required at least 70% agreement among the voting members to be included in the guidelines.

Nine recommendations and one expert opinion statement for the treatment of giant cell arteritis were developed considering the most up-to-date evidence and the socioeconomic characteristics of Latin America. These recommendations include guidance for the use of glucocorticoids, tocilizumab, methotrexate, and aspirin for patients with giant cell arteritis.

### Risk loci involved in giant cell arteritis susceptibility: A genome-wide association study [^115PBCEf]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Although our GWAS has provided valuable insights into the genetic basis of giant cell arteritis, it is essential to acknowledge this study's limitations. In our analysis, we addressed potential confounding factors, including sex and population stratification, to ensure robust and results that are reliable. However, it is crucial to recognize that other confounding variables, not explicitly addressed in this study, might contribute to the observed associations. Additionally, to further elucidate the functional importance of variants associated with giant cell arteritis, we acknowledge the need to complement our findings from this GWAS with experimental validations. This will allow us to substantiate the causal roles of these variants and provide a more comprehensive understanding of their effect on giant cell arteritis.

In conclusion, this study has notably expanded our understanding of the genetic architecture of giant cell arteritis, leading to the identification of cell types and genes that have a crucial role in the pathogenesis of this form of vasculitis. Specifically, our findings show a relevant involvement of angiogenesis and NET signaling in the development of giant cell arteritis. Furthermore, our study represents a step forward in translating genomic findings into clinical practice in this disease, proposing new treatments and a method to assess genetic predisposition to develop this vasculitis. These discoveries hold substantial clinical importance, offering avenues for more specific patient care and potentially influencing healthcare policies related to giant cell arteritis.

### Giant cell arteritis characterised by sore throat [^115dZbxJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Giant cell arteritis is a devastating condition that can lead to permanent vision loss. Early diagnosis is vital to initiate corticosteroid treatment before irreversible visual symptoms develop. This case study examines an 81-year-old woman with a history of polymyalgia rheumatica who initially presented with a sore throat and headache. She was ultimately diagnosed with giant cell arteritis; however, her diagnosis was delayed by multiple emergency and outpatient providers who failed to evaluate her for this condition. Her story reflects the importance of assessing polymyalgia rheumatica patients for giant cell arteritis, even when presenting with more unusual symptoms, such as a sore throat.

### Neck swelling and airway narrowing as an initial manifestation of giant cell arteritis [^114Aq73E]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Giant cell arteritis is a vasculitis affecting large-sized and medium-sized vessels, including the aorta and branches of the external carotid arteries. Histologically, it is characterized by a granulomatous process with infiltration of multinucleated cells, causing elastic laminae destruction and adventitial fibrosis. The inflammatory process is reflected in blood tests as a raised erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. Diagnosis of giant cell arteritis is based on the American College of Rheumatology's 1990 guideline, requiring the presence of three or more criteria out of five.

Giant cell arteritis is common in the elderly population, with an estimated incidence rate of 15–30 cases per 100,000 individuals. Due to the numerous structures supplied by the aorta and the external carotid arteries, giant cell arteritis can produce a broad range of symptoms. The most common symptoms include fatigue, fever, headache, mastication pain, and visual changes.

Facial and neck swelling is a subtle change that may feature early and insidiously in giant cell arteritis, although it is seldom reported. Other otolaryngologic symptoms include cough, trismus, sore throat, voice changes, dysphagia, hearing loss, and tongue claudication. Aortic involvement can produce thoracic pain, limb swelling, and thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection.

The lack of awareness of the less common symptoms may result in a late diagnosis of giant cell arteritis, leading to irreversible vision loss.

### Management of relapses in giant cell arteritis [^11166LZB]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2025). High credibility.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a relapsing large vessel vasculitis associated with serious ischemic manifestations, including vision loss and vascular damage in the form of large artery stenosis, aneurysms, and dissections. Approximately 50% of patients treated with glucocorticoid (GC) monotherapy and 30% of patients receiving adjunctive therapy with tocilizumab experience disease relapses, often during the first two years after diagnosis. Although most relapses in GCA do not involve life- or organ-threatening presentations and can be successfully controlled, frequent relapses may lead to increased prescription of GC and consequent treatment-related morbidity, in addition to risk of further vascular damage.

Emerging data suggest that persistent disease activity may lead to increased vascular morbidity. Additionally, while tocilizumab decreases the frequency of relapses, more than 50% of patients relapse after discontinuation of therapy. Therefore, although interleukin-6 blockade suppresses disease activity, it does not restore tolerance. In this article, we discuss the practical diagnosis and management of GCA relapses from an expert perspective. Treatment options for GCA relapses, including those recommended by international guidelines, as well as novel potential therapies, are reviewed.

### Infliximab for maintenance of glucocorticosteroid-induced remission of giant cell arteritis: a randomized trial [^113Z3gjx]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha is present in arteries in giant cell arteritis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of infliximab, an anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha agent, in giant cell arteritis.

- **Design**: Randomized, controlled trial.

- **Setting**: 22 sites in the United States, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Italy, and Spain.

- **Patients**: 44 patients with newly diagnosed giant cell arteritis that was in glucocorticosteroid-induced remission.

- **Intervention**: Participants were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive infliximab (5 mg/kg of body weight) or placebo. Sixteen patients were assigned to glucocorticosteroid plus placebo, and 28 patients to glucocorticosteroid plus infliximab.

- **Measurements**: End points were measured through week 22, when an interim analysis resulted in early stopping of the planned 54-week trial. Primary end points were the number of patients who remained free of relapse through week 22 and adverse events. Secondary end points were time to first relapse, biomarkers, cumulative glucocorticosteroid dose, and the number of patients who remained relapse-free while the glucocorticosteroid dosage was tapered to 10 mg/d.

- **Results**: Infliximab therapy did not increase the proportion of patients without relapse at week 22 compared with placebo (43% vs. 50%, respectively; difference, -7 percentage points [95% CI, -38 to 23 percentage points; P = 0.65]), nor did it increase the proportion of patients whose glucocorticosteroid dosages were tapered to 10 mg/d without relapse (61% vs. 75%, respectively; difference, -14 percentage points [CI, -42 to 14 percent]).

### A phase 3 trial of upadacitinib for giant-cell arteritis [^111dYpqd]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Giant-cell arteritis is a systemic vasculitis with limited treatment options. The efficacy and safety of upadacitinib, a selective Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that blocks signaling of several cytokines, including interleukin-6 and interferon-γ, are unknown in these patients.

- **Methods**: We randomly assigned patients with new-onset or relapsing giant-cell arteritis, in a 2:1:1 ratio, to receive upadacitinib at a dose of 15 mg or 7.5 mg orally once daily plus a 26-week glucocorticoid taper, or a placebo plus a 52-week glucocorticoid taper. The primary end point was sustained remission at week 52, defined by the absence of signs or symptoms of giant-cell arteritis from week 12 through week 52 and adherence to the protocol-specified glucocorticoid taper.

- **Results**: A total of 209 patients received upadacitinib at a dose of 15 mg, 107 received upadacitinib at a dose of 7.5 mg, and 112 received placebo; 70% of the patients had new-onset giant-cell arteritis. Upadacitinib at a dose of 15 mg showed superiority over placebo with respect to the primary end point (46.4% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 39.6 to 53.2] vs. 29.0% [95% CI, 20.6 to 37.5]; P = 0.002). Upadacitinib at a dose of 15 mg was superior to placebo in the analysis of the hierarchically prespecified and multiplicity-controlled key secondary end points of sustained complete remission, time to a disease flare, cumulative glucocorticoid exposure, and patient-reported outcomes. Upadacitinib at a dose of 7.5 mg was not superior to placebo with respect to the primary end point (41.1% [95% CI, 31…

### Combined treatment of giant-cell arteritis with methotrexate and prednisone. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^117YG7ry]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Corticosteroids remain the cornerstone of therapy for giant-cell arteritis, but relapse during dose tapering and corticosteroid-related adverse events often complicate management of this condition. Although several approaches, including combined therapy with cytotoxic agents, have been suggested to overcome these problems, no study has clearly shown benefits of alternate treatments.

- **Objective**: To analyze the safety and efficacy of combined therapy with corticosteroids and methotrexate in giant-cell arteritis.

- **Design**: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

- **Setting**: University-based clinic.

- **Patients**: 42 patients with new-onset giant-cell arteritis according to biopsy.

- **Intervention**: High initial doses of corticosteroid were given; the dose was then tapered quickly until therapy was completely withdrawn. Methotrexate or placebo was given weekly from the start of corticosteroid therapy for 24 months.

- **Measurements**: Number of relapses, cumulative dose of corticosteroid, and number of adverse events were assessed on completion of follow-up.

- **Results**: Compared with combined prednisone and placebo therapy, treatment with prednisone and methotrexate reduced the proportion of patients who experienced at least one relapse (45% vs. 84.2%; P = 0.02) and the proportion of patients who experienced multiple relapses (P = 0.004). The mean cumulative dose of prednisone was 4187 ± 1529 mg in the methotrexate group and 5489.5 ± 1396 mg in the placebo group (mean difference, 1302 mg [95% confidence interval, 350 to 2253 mg]; P = 0.009). Overall, the rate and severity of adverse events were assessed at the conclusion of the follow-up.

### Atypical signs and symptoms of giant cell arteritis: A systematic review [^112pkbBT]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Giant cell arteritis can present with atypical manifestations that delay treatment and risk severe complications.

- **Objectives**: To comprehensively describe all atypical signs and symptoms of giant cell arteritis.

- **Design**: In this systematic review, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to October 2022. Primary research articles that included at least one participant with an atypical sign or symptom of biopsy-proven giant cell arteritis were included. Study screening and data extraction were performed in duplicate. The primary outcome was the proportion of participants with atypical giant cell arteritis features. Time to treatment was compared between participants with atypical features only and those with both typical and atypical features.

- **Results**: Of 21,828 screened records, 429 studies corresponding to 746 individuals (median [IQR] age 72 [IQR, 66–78] years, 63% female) with at least one atypical feature of giant cell arteritis were included. Eighty-two percent had both atypical and at least one typical feature of giant cell arteritis, whereas 18% presented with atypical features only. Patients with atypical symptoms presented to clinicians earlier than those with typical features (p < 0.001). There was no difference between groups in the proportion of elevated ESR and CRP (82.3% vs. 83.35%, p = 0.91) or mortality rate (8.2% vs. 10.8%, p = 0.42). Patients with atypical features only experienced greater delay in treatment initiation (p < 0.001). The most commonly…

### Widespread arterial infection by varicella-zoster virus explains refractory giant cell arteritis [^115PtdLF]. Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

The pathologic diagnosis of VZV arteritis comes nearly 20 years after this patient's death. Reexamination of this case was prompted by the recognition that VZV is commonly found in the TAs of patients with GCA. VZV and extensive granulomatous arteritis in multiple large arteries were most likely due to reactivation of VZV in an elderly woman, followed by potentiation of virus infection by several months of high-dose corticosteroids.

Widespread vasculopathy occurs in patients with GCA treated with long-term corticosteroids. Recently, virologic studies in a man with thoracic-distribution zoster and a history of corticosteroid abuse who died suddenly revealed extensive VZV infection in multiple organs and arteries, particularly the coronary arteries and aorta, along with subclinical VZV vasculopathy. Large artery involvement in GCA has been increasingly documented.

Finally, our findings confirm detection of VZV antigen and VZV DNA in GCA-positive TAs and indicate that productive VZV infection in the TAs of patients with GCA parallels productive VZV infection in intracerebral arteries of patients with VZV vasculopathy. In fact, GCA is likely to be a form of VZV vasculopathy that predominantly, but not exclusively, affects the TA. Because VZV is triggering the immunopathology of GCA, it is likely that treatment of GCA patients with antiviral agents will not only shorten the course of corticosteroids needed to reduce the immunopathology that produces disease but also prevent the spread of VZV and the development of disseminated granulomatous arteritis.

### Ocular ischaemic syndrome due to giant cell arteritis [^111w51fv]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most common form of systemic vasculitis. It is classified as a large vessel vasculitis affecting the aorta and its branches. The reported prevalence is 19–25 cases per 100,000 people over the age of 50, with a preponderance among Caucasian women. GCA typically affects second to fifth-order branches of the arteries arising from the aortic arch, especially those supplying the head and neck. It is of autoimmune aetiology, associated with HLA-DR4 alleles.

The pathophysiology is driven by Th1 CD4+ T-lymphocytes' recruitment of monocytes and macrophages in a granulomatous process. This leads to both systemic and local responses:

- **Systemic response**: Arises through the release of interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 by activated monocytes.

- **Local effects**: May be seen histologically, where GCA presents with skip lesions causing fragmentation of the internal elastic lamina, presence of multinucleated giant cells, and inflammatory involvement of all layers of the arterial wall.

Clinically, systemic effects result in malaise, myalgia, fever, anorexia, and weight loss. Local effects depend on the distribution of affected arteries and may include:

- New onset headache with or without scalp tenderness due to superficial temporal artery involvement
- Jaw claudication with internal maxillary involvement
- Vision loss with involvement of the ophthalmic arteries and their branches

Additionally, GCA may affect the aorta, with risks of aneurysm formation, aortitis, stenosis, and dissection.

### A randomized, double-blind trial of abatacept (CTLA-4Ig) for the treatment of giant cell arteritis [^115bkQYT]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). High credibility.

To compare the efficacy of abatacept to that of placebo for the treatment of giant cell arteritis (GCA), this multicenter trial was conducted. Patients with newly diagnosed or relapsing GCA were treated with abatacept 10 mg/kg intravenously on days 1, 15, and 29 and at week 8, alongside daily prednisone administration. At week 12, patients in remission underwent a double-blinded randomization to continue abatacept monthly or switch to placebo. Patients in both study arms received a standardized prednisone taper, with discontinuation of prednisone at week 28. All patients remained on their randomized assignment until meeting criteria for early termination or until 12 months after the enrollment of the last patient. The primary endpoint was the duration of remission (relapse-free survival rate).

Forty-nine eligible patients with GCA were enrolled and treated with prednisone and abatacept. Of these, 41 reached the week 12 randomization and underwent a blinded randomization to receive abatacept or placebo. Prednisone was tapered using a standardized schedule, reaching a daily dosage of 20 mg at week 12 with discontinuation in all patients at week 28. The relapse-free survival rate at 12 months was 48% for those receiving abatacept and 31% for those receiving placebo (P = 0.049). A longer median duration of remission was seen in those receiving abatacept compared to those receiving placebo (median duration 9.9 months versus 3.9 months; P = 0.023). There was no difference in the frequency or severity of adverse events, including infection, between the treatment arms.

### Evidence on treat to target strategies in polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis: a systematic literature review [^111hyAeC]. Rheumatology (2024). Low credibility.

In studies on polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), glucocorticoid (GC)-related outcomes — such as cumulative GC dose, GC discontinuation, GC duration, or a specific GC target dose — were the most common treatment targets (90.9%); remission and relapse were applied in only half of the studies. In contrast, prevention of relapses, achievement of remission, and cumulative GC dosage were the most frequent targets in trials of giant cell arteritis (GCA).

The preference for GC-related outcomes in PMR and outcomes related to disease activity in GCA remains subject to speculation. An explanation could be the difficulty in assessing disease activity in PMR due to the presence of comorbidities that affect or mimic PMR symptoms. Another reason could be the observation that PMR does not cause long-term organ damage by itself, although it certainly impacts quality of life when active. However, the majority of patients experience adverse effects related to long-term GC therapy. Consequently, the reduction of GCs is an important therapeutic goal in PMR. In GCA, disease activity can potentially lead to vascular and organ damage if not adequately treated.

### Development of a diagnostic prediction model for giant cell arteritis by sequential application of Southend Giant Cell Arteritis Probability Score and ultrasonography: a prospective multicentre study [^112R8GxU]. The Lancet Rheumatology (2024). High credibility.

Giant cell arteritis is a critically ischaemic disease with protean manifestations that require urgent diagnosis and treatment. The European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology (EULAR) recommendations advocate ultrasonography as the first investigation for suspected giant cell arteritis. We developed a prediction tool that sequentially combines clinical assessment, as determined by the Southend Giant Cell Arteritis Probability Score (SGCAPS), with results of quantitative ultrasonography.

- **Methods**: This prospective, multicentre inception cohort study included consecutive patients with suspected new-onset giant cell arteritis referred to fast-track clinics at seven centres in Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and the UK. The final clinical diagnosis was established at 6 months. SGCAPS and quantitative ultrasonography of temporal and axillary arteries with three scores (i.e. halo count, halo score, and OMERACT GCA Score [OGUS]) were performed at diagnosis. We developed prediction models for the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis by multivariable logistic regression analysis with SGCAPS and each of the three ultrasonographic scores as predicting variables. An intraclass correlation coefficient for inter-rater and intra-rater reliability was obtained in a separate patient-based reliability exercise with five patients and five observers.

- **Findings**: Between Oct 1, 2019, and June 30, 2022, we recruited and followed up with 229 patients (150 [66%] women and 79 [34%] men; mean age 71 years [SD 10]). Of these, 84 were diagnosed with giant cell arteritis, and 145 with giant cell arteritis mimics.

The genetic basis of giant cell arteritis is not fully understood but may play a role in treatment resistance and increased risk of ischemic complications, including permanent vision loss. We present two of five cases of familial giant cell arteritis (2.5%) among 198 temporal artery biopsy-positive patients seen at a single institution over a 20-year period between 2003 and 2023, to highlight the importance of further genetic studies in this group of patients. This research aims to improve timely diagnosis, management, and detection of patients at greatest risk for ischemic sequelae.

### Identification of herpes zoster-associated temporal arteritis among cases of giant cell arteritis [^1127saWr]. American Journal of Ophthalmology (2018). Low credibility.

Perhaps the most informative case in our series was Case #3, involving a 78-year-old patient with an unusual and informative history (Figure 2). The patient first developed left trigeminal neuralgia in early June. She also experienced scalp tenderness and headaches. She was seen in the general ophthalmology clinic, and a left temporal artery biopsy was obtained on June 30. Examination of the H&E-stained temporal artery biopsy was negative for GCA. Although she was not given systemic corticosteroid treatment, the headaches and neuralgia lessened.

During the first two days of December, she noticed vesicular lesions in her left hairline. She was seen in the dermatology clinic on December 3, where herpes zoster of cranial nerve V1 was diagnosed, without any ocular involvement. She received a prescription for seven days of valacyclovir. The zoster rash abated with the antiviral treatment, without the development of postherpetic neuralgia.

On December 16, she was seen in the rheumatology clinic due to worsening jaw pain. The rheumatologist noted the history concerning a negative temporal artery biopsy in June and ordered a right temporal artery biopsy, which was performed on December 19. The second biopsy was read as positive for GCA, and the patient was placed on prednisone therapy. The slides adjacent to the H&E slides from June 30 and December 19 were retrieved and immunolabeled for herpes zoster antigen detection by IHC. The slide from June 30 was negative, but the slide from December 19 was positive for zoster antigen (Figure 2, Top row).

### Steroid management in giant cell arteritis [^112aJENG]. The British Journal of Ophthalmology (2001). Low credibility.

Ocular involvement in giant cell arteritis (GCA) is an ophthalmic emergency which, if untreated, can progress to permanent blindness. There is little evidence in the literature to support protocols for the acute treatment of GCA with steroids. The authors sought to review the effects of intravenous and oral steroids in GCA.

This retrospective study reviewed the records of 100 consecutive patients with biopsy-proven giant cell arteritis. Seventy-three patients with visual loss who were treated at the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital (RVEEH) and St Vincent's Hospital were included in the final series. The management of the patients in the first week after presentation was studied, analyzing types of treatment, dose, effect on visual acuity, and complications.

All the patients except one had visual loss due to anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION). Seventeen patients (23%) had bilateral eye involvement. Visual acuity improved in 21 of 73 patients (29%) by a mean of two Snellen chart lines after commencement of steroids. There was an increased likelihood of improved vision in the group who had intravenous steroids (40%) compared with those who received oral steroids (13%). In all except four patients (95%), vision remained stable at the 1-month review.

Prompt treatment of GCA with steroids leads to improvement of visual acuity in a significant number of cases. Intravenous steroids may offer a greater prospect of improvement compared with oral steroids. A prospective trial comparing intravenous with oral steroids is needed to validate the findings.

### Varicella zoster virus and giant cell arteritis [^112SMx9s]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a serious disease and the most common cause of vasculitis in the elderly. Recent studies have discovered varicella zoster virus (VZV) in the temporal arteries of patients with GCA, shedding light on potential virological aspects of the disease.

- **Recent findings**: GCA is characterized by severe headaches, scalp tenderness, and frequently includes symptoms such as vision loss, jaw claudication, polymyalgia rheumatica, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and fatigue. Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein are common indicators. Diagnosis is typically confirmed by a temporal artery biopsy, showing vessel wall damage, inflammation, and multinucleated giant cells or epithelioid macrophages. 'Skip lesions' are frequently observed. Notably, many clinically suspect cases have pathologically negative temporal artery biopsies. Recent virological findings indicate the presence of VZV in most GCA-positive and GCA-negative temporal artery biopsies, particularly in skip areas that correlate with adjacent GCA disease.

- **Summary**: The identified presence of VZV in both GCA-positive and GCA-negative temporal arteries suggests a potential role of VZV in triggering the immunopathology of GCA. Therefore, it is proposed that these patients should receive antiviral treatments alongside corticosteroids.

### Clinical practice. Giant-cell arteritis and polymyalgia rheumatica [^112nnBrM]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2014). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on giant cell arteritis (GCA):

- **Definition**: GCA is an inflammatory vasculitis affecting medium and large-sized arteries, with a predilection for the temporal arteries.

- **Pathophysiology**: In patients with GCA, the interaction of genetic and epigenetic factors causes pathologic activation of vascular dendritic cells, CD4 T cells, and macrophages, leading to granulomatous inflammation of the adventitia and hyperplasia of the intima. These vascular changes cause ischemic complications in tissues fed by medium and large-sized vessels.

- **Epidemiology**: In the US, the incidence of GCA is estimated at 18.9 cases per 100,000 person-years, while the prevalence is estimated at 228 persons per 100,000 population.

- **Disease course**: Ophthalmoplegia, vertebrobasilar insufficiency, central vision loss, stroke, and aortic aneurysm and rupture may occur as direct complications of vascular involvement.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Permanent vision loss occurs in approximately 15–20% of patients with GCA.
