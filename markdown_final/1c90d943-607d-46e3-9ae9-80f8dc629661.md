## Question

Abdominal compartment syndrome

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about diagnosing and managing abdominal compartment syndrome in critically ill patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clear WSACS definitions and diagnostic thresholds to anchor the discussion. Then, I should verify how and when to measure intra-abdominal pressure and the reliability of methods. Next, I will review risk factors and identify who needs surveillance. After that, I will structure a tiered management algorithm from medical to minimally invasive to surgical decompression. I should then consider open abdomen management and timing of closure. I will also examine special populations like pediatrics. Finally, I need to appraise evidence quality, correct any misapplications, and synthesize a practical decision pathway with red flags for urgent escalation [^113CWMcb] [^111YWo2x].

> Let me first confirm the core definitions, because everything else depends on these thresholds. Intra-abdominal hypertension is a sustained or repeated pathological elevation in intra-abdominal pressure of 12 mmHg or higher, graded I to IV as 12–15, 16–20, 21–25, and greater than 25 mmHg, respectively. Abdominal compartment syndrome is defined as sustained IAP above 20 mmHg, with or without abdominal perfusion pressure below 60 mmHg, plus new organ dysfunction or failure. I should double-check that these are the 2013 WSACS consensus definitions, which they are, and they remain the standard used in contemporary guidance and studies [^113CWMcb] [^111YWo2x] [^113x4ua6] [^116tS9zX].

> Next, I should review how to measure IAP accurately, because clinical examination alone is insensitive. Wait, let me verify the recommended method and protocol. The intravesical (bladder) technique with 20–25 mL sterile saline at end-expiration in supine position, zeroed at the mid-axillary line at the iliac crest, is the reference standard for intermittent measurements; it should be obtained when any known risk factor is present and repeated every 4–6 hours if IAH/ACS is suspected or confirmed. Intragastric methods may be acceptable alternatives but require further validation, and continuous IAP monitoring devices are promising yet not established as a gold standard. I need to ensure I stress that practice should not rely on exam alone and should be protocolized for reliability [^111YWo2x] [^1116d3eZ] [^111qx1kM] [^116tS9zX].

> I will now examine who is at risk and requires proactive surveillance, because missed or delayed recognition worsens outcomes. Hold on, I should verify the highest-risk scenarios: massive fluid resuscitation and secondary ACS after extra-abdominal trauma or burns, severe acute pancreatitis, major abdominal/pelvic trauma and damage control laparotomy, postoperative states like liver transplantation or mesenteric revascularization, severe sepsis with capillary leak, and ventilator-associated auto-PEEP causing transmitted pressure. Let me also consider that protocolized surveillance programs appear to improve survival and closure rates, though much of the data are observational [^113C3bwp] [^1133Pxzp] [^112PfwUU] [^111bh46M] [^116LadLv] [^1133EQYk] [^112879gn] [^117FLSwj].

> Now, I need to implement a stepwise management algorithm, starting with Tier 1 medical therapies for IAH Grades I–II and as temporizing measures in higher grades. Let me think about goals: reduce IAP and restore perfusion while buying time. Evacuate intraluminal contents with nasogastric and rectal decompression if dilated, and consider neostigmine for colonic pseudo-obstruction that is refractory to simple measures. Improve abdominal wall compliance with adequate analgesia and sedation, and consider short trials of neuromuscular blockade when appropriate. I should confirm that head-of-bed elevation can increase IAP and should be minimized if pressures are high. Finally, optimize fluid balance by avoiding sustained positive cumulative balance after initial resuscitation; diuretics and renal replacement can be considered case-by-case, but recommendations are weak and evidence is limited, so I need to be cautious in over-asserting benefit [^113ViEZw] [^113yMjsT] [^112moNc9] [^114co7y1] [^114BTMYX] [^113TvNFP] [^113swWKS] [^113dJe4r].

> If Tier 1 is insufficient or if imaging shows substantial intraperitoneal fluid, I should consider Tier 2: percutaneous catheter drainage. Wait, I should verify indications and strength of recommendation. WSACS suggests PCD when obvious intraperitoneal fluid is present and drainage is technically feasible; it can avert or delay a decompressive laparotomy in selected cases, although evidence quality is low. In severe pancreatitis, PCD has been underutilized as first-line intervention for ACS but remains appropriate when collections are accessible, with variable impact on outcomes across small cohorts [^114XYpBf] [^1133Pxzp].

> For overt ACS or refractory Grade IV IAH with organ dysfunction despite Tier 1–2 measures, I should confirm that decompressive laparotomy is indicated. Let me double-check the threshold and guidance. WSACS makes a strong recommendation to perform decompressive laparotomy for overt ACS, and WSES similarly recommends DL when medical therapy fails with reliable IAP confirmation. Earlier decompression is associated with better physiologic recovery in experimental models, and human cohort data show rapid IAP reduction and improved oxygenation and urine output in survivors, though morbidity is common and mortality remains substantial, underscoring the need for timely escalation rather than delay [^112YMpCi] [^112dd65f] [^112fMVjC] [^111we5uH] [^1174bR1B].

> After decompression, I need to ensure appropriate open abdomen management with a plan for early closure. Let me verify the preferred temporary closure and timing. Negative pressure wound therapy is recommended for open abdominal wounds, with active efforts to achieve early or at least same-admission fascial closure to reduce complications. Routine early use of bioprosthetic meshes should be avoided. In trauma with physiologic exhaustion, a prophylactic open abdomen strategy can be considered, while in severe peritonitis/sepsis, the open abdomen may be used when visceral edema precludes safe closure; conversely, after pancreatic necrosectomy, leaving the abdomen open is not recommended unless ACS risk is high. Early definitive closure should be pursued once resuscitation is complete, source control is secured, bowel viability is assured, and no re-exploration or ACS concern remains [^111oEGPW] [^111sbw8L] [^114zxTVU] [^113dfYFN] [^112PfwUU] [^111i3Ch8] [^116oPahE] [^116DkUrW] [^115V4v8A].

> I should now consider special populations where thresholds and vigilance may differ. Pediatric ACS is uncommon but highly morbid and frequently underrecognized; definitions are adapted by pediatric subcommittees, but the evidence base is sparse. Let me verify that case series report mortality above 50% in some cohorts, which argues for a lower threshold to measure IAP and escalate care using the same stepwise approach, tailored to size and etiology. Nursing recognition and contextual risk factors in pediatric ICUs also matter, and multidisciplinary protocols can improve detection [^115t2tGf] [^113VQ8kP] [^113cqbQC] [^112G4hZv].

> Next, I should review the overall quality of evidence and correct any misapplications. Much of the guidance relies on GRADE 1C recommendations for measurement protocols, avoiding sustained IAH, and decompressive laparotomy for overt ACS, acknowledging low to very low certainty but strong consensus due to pathophysiologic plausibility and observational benefit. Continuous IAP monitoring remains investigational without a gold standard, and abdominal perfusion pressure has not achieved recommendation status as a resuscitation endpoint. Wait, I initially considered extrapolating AAOS acute compartment syndrome guidance on serial clinical examinations, but hold on, I should verify scope; that AAOS guideline addresses limb compartment syndromes, not abdominal, so I must not conflate them for diagnostic strategy in ACS. The correct emphasis for ACS is protocolized IAP measurement rather than reliance on serial exams alone [^113TxJcH] [^113CWMcb] [^111YWo2x] [^111qx1kM] [^115ZsmMt] [^114fK3T4].

> Let me synthesize a pragmatic decision pathway, and I should double-check the inflection points and timelines. Recognize risk and initiate IAP monitoring via bladder every 4–6 hours with standardized technique; if IAP is 12 mmHg or higher, begin Tier 1 medical therapy while addressing cause and optimizing perfusion; if IAP reaches or exceeds 20 mmHg with new organ dysfunction, escalate promptly to Tier 2 with PCD if fluid collections are amenable; if organ dysfunction persists or IAP remains severely elevated despite these measures, proceed to emergent decompressive laparotomy with planned open abdomen care and early closure strategy. Time sensitivity matters: avoid prolonged trials of ineffective medical therapy; experimental data suggest worse outcomes when decompression is delayed beyond 9–12 hours after established ACS, supporting expedited decisions in deteriorating patients, while center-level algorithms have been associated with improved survival and closure rates [^1116d3eZ] [^111YWo2x] [^112fMVjC] [^112879gn].

> Finally, I need to ensure I highlight red flags that require immediate escalation. Hmm, wait a minute, I should list those with the strongest backing: IAP greater than 25 mmHg with signs of evolving organ failure, rapidly rising IAP accompanied by oliguria or escalating ventilator pressures and hypoxemia, refractory shock or rising lactate despite resuscitation, and failure of Tier 1–2 measures with persistent organ dysfunction. In these scenarios, I should confirm the diagnosis with reliable IAP measurements and expedite decompressive laparotomy rather than continuing temporizing measures that are unlikely to reverse the trajectory, integrating PCD if fluid burden is a contributory driver and technically accessible [^113CWMcb] [^112dd65f] [^111we5uH].

The **definition** of abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is sustained intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) > 20 mmHg [^111YWo2x] with new organ dysfunction or failure [^1131iAAL]. Who is at risk: ACS is most common in **critically ill or trauma patients** [^113C3bwp] after massive resuscitation, major abdominal surgery, severe pancreatitis [^116GW27A], or burns [^111YWo2x] [^1131iAAL]. Diagnosis requires serial IAP measurements — typically via the bladder [^111qx1kM] — as clinical examination alone is unreliable [^111YWo2x].

The **initial management focus** is medical measures [^114BADYf] (sedation [^116r69YP], neuromuscular blockade [^114co7y1], nasogastric/rectal decompression [^113ViEZw], fluid restriction [^114BTMYX], percutaneous drainage [^113CWMcb] [^114XYpBf]). If IAP remains > 20 mmHg with ongoing organ dysfunction, decompressive laparotomy [^112YMpCi] is indicated [^112dd65f]. Early recognition and intervention are critical, as mortality remains high (40–70%) [^111YAALn] even with treatment [^1131iAAL] [^1133Pxzp].

---

## Pathophysiology

The **mechanism** of ACS is sustained elevation of IAP [^111YWo2x], which reduces venous return, decreases cardiac output [^115bRu9w], increases systemic vascular resistance, and impairs organ perfusion. This triggers a cascade of ischemia, inflammation, and multi-organ dysfunction, including acute kidney injury, respiratory failure, and cardiovascular collapse [^1131iAAL] [^113d8xnA].

---

## Risk factors and causes

For **classification**, ACS is categorized as primary, secondary, or tertiary [^116qbnn7]. Primary ACS involves direct intra-abdominal injury or pathology (e.g. trauma, ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm, severe pancreatitis [^116GW27A], major abdominal surgery) [^111YWo2x] [^1131iAAL]. Secondary ACS results from indirect causes such as massive fluid resuscitation [^113C3bwp], severe burns, sepsis, or extra-abdominal trauma [^111YWo2x] [^1131iAAL]. Tertiary ACS refers to recurrent ACS after previous surgical decompression or open abdomen management [^111YWo2x] [^115msGgH].

---

## Clinical presentation

ACS presents with the following signs and symptoms:

- **Abdominal distension**: Firm, tense abdomen [^1131iAAL] [^111YWo2x].

- **Respiratory distress**: Increased peak inspiratory pressures, hypoxia, hypercapnia [^1131iAAL] [^113d8xnA].

- **Cardiovascular instability**: Hypotension, tachycardia, decreased cardiac output [^1131iAAL] [^115bRu9w].

- **Renal dysfunction**: Oliguria or anuria, acute kidney injury [^1131iAAL] [^113DdGK1].

- **Neurological impairment**: Altered mental status, increased intracranial pressure [^1131iAAL] [^113d8xnA].

---

## Diagnosis

The **diagnosis** of ACS relies on objective IAP measurement because clinical examination alone is unreliable [^1116d3eZ] [^116tS9zX]. The gold standard is intravesical (bladder) pressure measurement [^111YWo2x], typically performed every 4–6 hours in at-risk patients [^111qx1kM]. ACS is defined as sustained IAP > 20 mmHg with new organ dysfunction or failure [^111YWo2x] [^113x4ua6].

---

## Management

The **management approach** is stepwise [^116qbnn7]: begin with medical management and escalate to surgical intervention if necessary:

---

### Medical management

- **Sedation and analgesia**: Reduce abdominal wall muscle tone and improve compliance [^114co7y1] [^116r69YP].

- **Neuromuscular blockade**: Temporizing measure to reduce IAP [^114co7y1].

- **Nasogastric and rectal decompression**: Evacuate intraluminal contents [^113ViEZw] [^114BADYf].

- **Fluid management**: Avoid positive fluid balance after initial resuscitation [^114BTMYX].

- **Percutaneous catheter drainage**: Remove intra-abdominal fluid collections [^113CWMcb] [^114XYpBf].

---

### Surgical management

For **indications and technique**, surgical management centers on decompressive laparotomy [^112YMpCi] when medical measures fail and IAP remains > 20 mmHg with ongoing organ dysfunction [^112dd65f]. Temporary open abdomen techniques, such as negative pressure wound therapy, are recommended for abdominal closure [^111oEGPW]. Early fascial closure [^111sbw8L] is attempted once the patient is stabilized and IAP has normalized [^116DkUrW].

---

## Complications

Regarding **complications**, ACS is associated with multi-organ dysfunction, including respiratory failure, acute kidney injury [^113DdGK1], and cardiovascular collapse [^1131iAAL] [^113d8xnA]. Infectious complications — such as sepsis, wound infections, and intra-abdominal abscesses — can occur [^1131iAAL], often leading to prolonged ICU stay with increased morbidity and mortality [^1131iAAL] [^115bRu9w] [^111YAALn].

---

## Prognosis

The **prognosis** depends on early recognition and timely, effective management. Mortality remains high at 40%–70%, even with appropriate treatment [^1131iAAL] [^1133Pxzp] [^113C3bwp]. Early decompressive laparotomy and aggressive medical management can significantly improve outcomes [^112879gn] [^111we5uH].

---

## Prevention

For **prevention**, key strategies include:

- **Early identification**: Recognize at-risk patients and monitor IAP regularly [^111YWo2x] [^117FLSwj].

- **Fluid management**: Avoid excessive fluid resuscitation and maintain neutral fluid balance [^114BTMYX].

- **Open abdomen approach**: Consider prophylactic open abdomen in high-risk trauma patients [^115U6n5k] [^112PfwUU].

- **Multidisciplinary approach**: Involve critical care, surgery, and nursing teams in management [^1131iAAL] [^116qbnn7].

---

The **bottom line**: abdominal compartment syndrome is a critical condition characterized by sustained elevated intra-abdominal pressure leading to multi-organ dysfunction. Early recognition, accurate diagnosis, and prompt management are essential to improve patient outcomes and reduce mortality.

**Management of IAH/ACS**: In addition to decompressive laparotomy for ACS, numerous medical and minimally invasive therapies have been proposed or studied that may be beneficial for patients with IAH or ACS. Approaches or techniques of potential utility include sedation and analgesia, neuromuscular blockade, body positioning, nasogastric/colonic decompression, promotility agents, diuretics, and continuous renal replacement therapies. Fluid resuscitation strategies, percutaneous catheter drainage (PCD), and different temporary abdominal closure (TAC) techniques are also considered valuable among those requiring an open abdomen.

### International cross-sectional survey on current and updated definitions of intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome [^111qx1kM]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

IAP measurement through the intravesical route using an instillation volume of 20–25 mL of sterile saline is widely used and is currently considered a reference standard. Despite the agreement, the respondents expressed divergent opinions on the optimal volume of saline. The intragastric route using a 50–75 mL instillation volume has been suggested as a valid alternative for IAP measurement. However, the statement failed to reach the desired agreement because the respondents emphasized the need for further validation, clear guidelines, and evidence supporting its use.

Bladder or intragastric routes are traditionally the preferred techniques for continuously monitoring IAP. The WSACS guidelines recommend intermittent IAP measurement every 4–6 hours in those with suspected or confirmed IAH or ACS. Recently, newer techniques of continuous IAP measurement have been tested with conflicting results. However, some recent results from in vitro, animal, and first-in-human validation with TraumaGuard and Serenno devices seem promising. Despite the use of different methods for the continuous measurement of the IAP, the gold standard has yet to be identified.

Continuous intra-abdominal pressure (CIAP) monitoring, which offers numerous benefits that enhance care and outcomes, is essential for managing critically ill patients in the twenty-first century. CIAP allows real-time trend monitoring of the IAP, enabling clinicians to observe dynamic changes and prompt timely interventions to prevent complications. It captures the effects of body position changes on the IAP, aiding patient management.

### Abdominal compartment syndrome: an emergency department perspective [^1131iAAL]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Compartment syndromes can occur in many body regions. Abdominal compartment syndrome, initially described many years ago, has become increasingly recognized in critical care patients. The key points regarding its definition, pathophysiology, etiology, and treatment are described and discussed. Abdominal compartment syndrome is defined as an intra-abdominal pressure > 20 mm Hg with evidence of organ dysfunction. At-risk patients should be identified in the emergency department, and early monitoring of intra-abdominal pressure instituted. Interventions in the emergency department potentially contribute to the development of abdominal compartment syndrome during subsequent phases of care. The need to ensure an early multidisciplinary approach in the management of this complex condition is essential for the best possible patient outcome.

### Abdominal compartment syndrome in acute pancreatitis: A systematic review [^1133Pxzp]. Pancreas (2014). Low credibility.

Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is a lethal complication of acute pancreatitis. We performed a systematic review to assess the treatment and outcome of these patients. A systematic literature search for cohorts of patients with acute pancreatitis and ACS was conducted. The main outcomes were the number of patients with ACS, radiologic and surgical interventions, morbidity, mortality, and methodological quality. After screening 169 articles, 7 studies were included. Three studies were prospective, and 4 studies were retrospective. The overall methodological quality of the studies was moderate to low.

The pooled data consisted of 271 patients, of whom 103 (38%) developed ACS. Percutaneous drainage of intraabdominal fluid was reported as the first intervention in 11 (11%) patients. Additional decompressive laparotomy was performed in 8 patients. Overall, decompressive laparotomy was performed in a total of 76 (74%) patients. The median decrease in intraabdominal pressure was 15 mm Hg (range, 33–18 mm Hg). Mortality in acute pancreatitis patients with ACS was 49%, compared to 11% without ACS. Morbidity ranged from 17% to 90%.

Abdominal compartment syndrome during acute pancreatitis is associated with high mortality and morbidity. The studies are relatively small and have methodological shortcomings. The optimal timing and method of invasive interventions, as well as their effect on clinical outcomes, should be further evaluated.

### Secondary abdominal compartment syndrome: a potential threat for all trauma clinicians [^113C3bwp]. Injury (2007). Low credibility.

Post-injury abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is an increasingly recognized phenomenon in critical care. Over the last decade, ACS has also been identified in patients without abdominal injuries, referred to as secondary ACS. Recent investigations have improved the understanding of this elusive syndrome, which can have a mortality rate of up to 70%. Regardless of the cause of the syndrome and the nature of any extra-abdominal injuries, secondary ACS is invariably associated with massive fluid resuscitation. With a reliable predictive model and new monitoring techniques, trauma clinicians should be able to identify high-risk patients and mitigate the impact of this syndrome.

Should we measure IAP? Should we measure it via the bladder? Should we use an IAP measurement protocol? (Supplement 8; see 10.1007/s00134–013–2906-z)

As clinical examination is inaccurate for detecting raised IAP, IAH, and ACS research and management rely upon accurate serial or continuous IAP measurements. Although there is an increasing number of IAP measurement techniques, trans-bladder measurement remains a commonly used method and was recommended by the WSACS in 2006 due to its simplicity and low cost.

- **Recommendation**: We recommend measuring IAP versus not when any known risk factor for IAH/ACS is present in critically ill or injured patients (Unchanged Management Recommendation 1 [GRADE 1C]) (Table 2). We also recommend that studies of IAH or ACS adopt the trans-bladder technique as a standard IAP measurement technique (Unchanged Management Recommendation 2 [not GRADED]). Finally, we recommend the use of protocolized monitoring and management of IAP versus not (New Management Recommendation 3 [GRADE 1C]).

### Intraabdominal pressure in abdominoplasty patients [^111f3WtQ]. Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Abdominal compartment syndrome is directly related to an increase in intraabdominal pressure (IAP), which can, in severe cases, lead to serious clinical consequences. Routine measurement of IAP in specific cases is advocated by some surgical specialties; however, few studies in plastic surgery have focused on the use of IAP. The authors review the literature and describe a method of IAP analysis used for 12 patients who underwent abdominoplasty.

### Decompressive laparotomy for abdominal compartment syndrome [^111we5uH]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The effect of decompressive laparotomy on outcomes in patients with abdominal compartment syndrome has been poorly investigated. The aim of this prospective cohort study was to describe the effect of decompressive laparotomy for abdominal compartment syndrome on organ function and outcomes.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective cohort study in adult patients who underwent decompressive laparotomy for abdominal compartment syndrome. The primary endpoints were 28-day and 1-year all-cause mortality. Changes in intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and organ function, along with laparotomy-related morbidity, were secondary endpoints.

- **Results**: Thirty-three patients were included in the study (20 men). Twenty-seven patients were surgical admissions treated for abdominal conditions. The median (IQR) Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score was 26 (20–32). Median IAP was 23 (21–27) mmHg before decompressive laparotomy, decreasing to 12 (9–15), 13 (8–17), 12 (9–15), and 12 (9–14) mmHg after 2, 6, 24, and 72 hours, respectively. Decompressive laparotomy significantly improved oxygenation and urinary output. Survivors showed improvement in organ function scores, but non-survivors did not. Fourteen complications related to the procedure developed in eight of the 33 patients. The abdomen could be closed primarily in 18 patients. The overall 28-day mortality rate was 36 percent (12 of 33), which increased to 55 percent (18 patients) at 1 year. Non-survivors were no different from survivors, except for a tendency to be older and on mechanical ventilation.

### Abdominal compartment syndrome and acute kidney injury due to excessive auto-positive end-expiratory pressure [^1133EQYk]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2013). Low credibility.

Abdominal compartment syndrome is an under-recognized cause of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients. We report a case of a patient with severe obstructive lung disease who, while intubated for respiratory failure, developed abdominal compartment syndrome and oliguric acute kidney injury due to air-trapping and excessive auto-positive end-expiratory pressure (auto-PEEP; also known as intrinsic PEEP). When chemical paralysis was initiated and the auto-PEEP resolved, the patient's intra-abdominal hypertension rapidly improved and kidney function recovered immediately. Abdominal compartment syndrome secondary to excessive auto-PEEP appears to be unreported in the literature; however, any process that significantly increases intrathoracic pressure conceivably could cause increased pressure to be transmitted to the abdominal compartment, resulting in organ failure. Patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, which puts them at risk of airflow obstruction and the development of intra-abdominal hypertension, should be evaluated for air-trapping and excessive auto-PEEP.

### Abdominal compartment syndrome after liver transplantation [^111bh46M]. Liver Transplantation (2005). Low credibility.

Abdominal compartment syndrome is a well-known complication after abdominal trauma and is increasingly recognized as a potential risk factor for renal failure and mortality after adult orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).

We present a case report of a young patient who presented with acute liver failure complicated by an acute pancreatitis. The patient developed acute abdominal compartment syndrome after OLT. Transurethral measurement of intraabdominal pressure indicated an abdominal compartment syndrome associated with impaired abdominal vascular perfusion, including liver perfusion. Renal insufficiency was immediately reversed after decompressive bedside laparotomy.

Abdominal compartment syndrome is a potential source of posttransplant renal insufficiency and liver necrosis in OLT. It remains, however, a rarely described complication after liver transplantation, despite the presence of significant factors that contribute to elevated intraabdominal pressure.

### Evaluation and management of abdominal compartment syndrome in the emergency department [^114LRMx5]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2020). Low credibility.

Abdominal compartment syndrome is a potentially deadly condition that can be missed in the emergency department setting.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this narrative review article is to provide a summary of the background, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of abdominal compartment syndrome with a focus on emergency clinicians.

- **Discussion**: Abdominal compartment syndrome is caused by excessive pressure within the abdominal compartment due to diminished abdominal wall compliance, increased intraluminal contents, increased abdominal contents, or capillary leak/fluid resuscitation. History and physical examination are insufficient in isolation, and the gold standard is intra-abdominal pressure measurement. Abdominal compartment syndrome is defined as an intra-abdominal pressure > 20 mm Hg with evidence of end-organ injury. Management involves increasing abdominal wall compliance (e.g. analgesia, sedation, and neuromuscular blocking agents), evacuating gastrointestinal contents (e.g. nasogastric tubes, rectal tubes, and prokinetic agents), avoiding excessive fluid resuscitation, draining intraperitoneal contents (e.g. percutaneous drain), and performing decompressive laparotomy in select cases. Patients are critically ill and often require admission to a critical care unit.

- **Conclusions**: Abdominal compartment syndrome is an increasingly recognized condition with the potential for significant morbidity and mortality. It is important for clinicians to be aware of the evidence regarding the diagnosis, management, and disposition of these patients.

### IAH/ACS: the rationale for surveillance [^117FLSwj]. World Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Surveillance for intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) should be implemented in every intensive care unit (ICU) because it has been demonstrated that surveillance is effective.

- **Rationale**: Several criteria have led to the conclusion that IAH/ACS monitoring is of value. First, IAH is a frequent problem in critically ill patients that directly affects the function of all organ systems to some degree and is associated with considerable mortality.

	- **Availability of tools**: Simple tools for intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) monitoring are available, and it can be safely applied without the need for advanced tools.

	- **Treatment options**: Both ACS and IAH can be treated with either medical or surgical interventions. Treatment for IAH/ACS should be selected based on the severity of symptoms and the cause of IAH.

Incorporating IAP monitoring into the daily ICU management of the patient is essential.

### Intraabdominal hypertension, abdominal compartment syndrome, and the open abdomen [^113d8xnA]. Chest (2018). Low credibility.

Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is the end point of a process whereby massive interstitial swelling in the abdomen or the rapid development of a space-filling lesion in the abdomen, such as ascites or a hematoma, leads to pathologically increased pressure. This results in intraabdominal hypertension (IAH), causing decreased perfusion of the kidneys and abdominal viscera, and possible difficulties with ventilation and maintenance of cardiac output. These effects contribute to a cascade of ischemia and multiple organ dysfunction with high mortality.

A few primary disease processes, traditionally requiring large-volume crystalloid resuscitation, account for most cases of IAH and ACS. Once IAH is recognized, nonsurgical steps to decrease intraabdominal pressure (IAP) can be undertaken, such as diuresis/dialysis, evacuation of intraluminal bowel contents, and sedation. However, the clinical benefit of such therapies remains largely conjectural.

Surgical decompression with midline laparotomy is the standard ultimate treatment once ACS with organ dysfunction is established. There is minimal primary literature on the pathophysiological underpinnings of IAH and ACS, and few prospective randomized trials evaluating their treatment or prevention. This concise review, therefore, provides only brief summaries of these topics. Many modern studies nominally dealing with IAH or ACS are simply epidemiologic surveys on their incidence. This paper summarizes the incidence of IAH and ACS in a variety of disease states, with particular emphasis on modern critical care paradigms.

### Abdominal compartment syndrome [^113DdGK1]. Critical Care Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Acute renal failure frequently occurs in the intensive care unit as a primary or secondary event associated with trauma, surgery, or comorbid medical diseases. A common thread linking surgical and medical disease management is abdominal compartment syndrome. Notably, the rise of early goal-directed therapy for the initial resuscitation and management of severe sepsis and septic shock is linked with an increased frequency of secondary abdominal compartment syndrome.

This paper explores the pathophysiology underpinning abdominal compartment syndrome and its contribution to acute kidney injury and acute renal failure, focusing on intra-abdominal pressure dynamics, preload limitation, and afterload augmentation. Diagnostic modalities and therapeutic interventions are addressed to reduce the frequency of acute kidney injury and acute renal failure in the critically ill.

### Abdominal compartment syndrome after mesenteric revascularization [^116LadLv]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) results from increased pressure within the abdominal cavity, leading to multisystem organ dysfunction. The most common cause of ACS is increased intraperitoneal volume from any source, although extrinsic compression can also elevate intra-abdominal pressure. Although ACS is well-documented in patients with trauma, little has been reported on ACS in postoperative patients without traumatic injuries. We report on a patient who developed acute ACS two days after surgical revascularization for chronic mesenteric ischemia. With appropriate treatment, the patient made a rapid and complete recovery. We present this case of acute ACS in a postoperative patient without trauma to increase awareness and help minimize deaths caused by this devastating syndrome.

### Postoperative gastric dilatation causing abdominal compartment syndrome [^115M8GZg]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is defined as an increased intra-abdominal pressure (IAP > 20 mmHg) in combination with single or multiple organ dysfunction which was not previously present. This condition affects multiple organ systems in a graded fashion. Early identification and abdominal decompression are essential in the management and treatment of this difficult situation; otherwise, it leads to multiple organ failure and, ultimately, death.

Increased intra-peritoneal volume conditions are the most common source of elevated IAP. Extrinsic compression of the abdomen by burn eschars, pneumatic anti-shock garments, tight abdominal closure, massive volume resuscitation for any reason, and inflation of the peritoneum by CO2 in laparoscopic surgery can also lead to increased IAP. We present a rare case of abdominal compartment syndrome caused by postoperative gastric dilatation in a 72-year-old woman.

### Is the evolving management of intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome improving survival [^112879gn]. Critical Care Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

The diagnosis and management of intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome have undergone significant changes over the past decade. There is an improved understanding of the pathophysiology and appropriate treatment of these disease processes. Serial intra-abdominal pressure measurements, nonoperative pressure-reducing interventions, and early abdominal decompression for refractory intra-abdominal hypertension or abdominal compartment syndrome are all key elements of this evolving strategy.

- **Design**: Prospective, observational study.

- **Setting**: Tertiary referral/level I trauma center.

- **Patients**: Four hundred seventy-eight consecutive patients requiring an open abdomen for the management of intra-abdominal hypertension or abdominal compartment syndrome.

- **Interventions**: Patients were managed by a defined group of surgical intensivists using established definitions and an evidence-based management algorithm. Both univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify patient and management factors associated with improved survival.

- **Measurements and main results**: Whereas patient demographics and severity of illness remained unchanged over the 6-year study period, the use of a continually revised intra-abdominal hypertension/abdominal compartment syndrome management algorithm significantly increased patient survival to hospital discharge from 50% to 72% (p = .015). Clinically significant decreases in resource utilization and an increase in same-admission primary fascial closure from 59% to 81% were recognized. Development of abdominal compartment syndrome.

### Intra-abdominal hypertension and the abdominal compartment syndrome [^111YAALn]. The British Journal of Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) occurs when intra-abdominal pressure is abnormally high in association with organ dysfunction. It tends to have a poor outcome, even when treated promptly by abdominal decompression.

- **Methods**: A search of the Medline database was performed to identify articles related to intra-abdominal hypertension and ACS.

- **Results**: Currently, there is no agreed definition or management of ACS. However, it is suggested that intra-abdominal pressure should be measured in patients at risk, with values above 20 mmHg being considered abnormal in most. Abdominal decompression should be considered in patients with rising pressure and organ dysfunction, indicated by increased airway pressure, reduced cardiac output, and oliguria. Organ dysfunction often occurs at an intra-abdominal pressure greater than 35 mmHg and may start to develop between 26 and 35 mmHg. The mean survival rate of patients affected by compartment syndrome is 53 percent.

- **Conclusion**: The optimal time for intervention is not known, but the outcome is often poor, even after decompression. Most of the available information relates to victims of trauma rather than general surgical patients.

### Abdominal compartment syndrome in the pediatric population - Case series and review of the literature [^113cqbQC]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Low credibility.

Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) in children is a rare but life-threatening condition caused by increased intra-abdominal pressure, leading to multi-organ dysfunction. Despite its severity, pediatric ACS remains underrecognized, with limited data available to guide diagnosis and management.

- **Aim**: This study aims to contribute to the scarce literature by summarizing our institutional experience in diagnosing and managing pediatric ACS.

- **Methods**: A retrospective review was conducted of all patients under 18 years who underwent decompressive laparotomy for ACS between 2014 and 2024 at a single tertiary pediatric center. Data included demographics, underlying conditions, surgical details, and clinical outcomes.

- **Results**: Nine children, aged one week to seven years, were diagnosed with ACS and treated surgically. Etiologies varied and included postoperative complications, sepsis, and congenital anomalies such as Hirschsprung's disease, cyanotic congenital heart disease, and imperforate anus. Surgical approaches included decompressive laparotomy with or without bowel resection and open abdomen management using a Bogota bag. Despite intensive care, the mortality rate exceeded 50% (5/9 patients).

- **Conclusions**: Pediatric ACS is a heterogeneous condition with limited published data and significant mortality. Improved awareness, early recognition of warning signs, and timely surgical decompression are critical to improving outcomes in this vulnerable population.

Should we keep fluid balance neutral or even negative among ICU patients? An increased or positive fluid balance has been associated with third space fluid accumulation and organ dysfunction in animal models. However, it remains unknown whether strategies that target a neutral or even negative fluid balance after the initial resuscitation of critically ill patients may be linked with improved clinical outcomes.

- **Statement**: We suggest using a protocol to try to avoid a positive cumulative fluid balance in the critically ill or injured with, or at risk of, IAH/ACS after the acute resuscitation has been completed and the inciting issues have been addressed (New Management Suggestion 6 [GRADE 2C]).

### Decompressive laparotomy for abdominal compartment syndrome [^112fMVjC]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

This trend towards improved survival may be explained by several factors. As already mentioned, ACS may now be treated at an earlier stage; however, recent insights into the pathophysiology of both IAH and ACS and the related role of fluid overload, as well as improvements in haemodynamic and ventilatory management, may also have contributed. Finally, improvements in management of the open abdomen, previously considered a challenging condition, and the focus on early abdominal closure to avoid subsequent complications undoubtedly contributed to the relatively low complication rates and low early mortality rates in the present study. Late mortality was significantly higher, a finding in line with the above‐mentioned studies.

The timing of DL is an important issue, although this could not be confirmed in the present study. Skoog and co‐workers studied the effect of DL on peritoneal metabolism at 4 hours after inducing IAH (30 mmHg) in a porcine model. They found that early DL resulted in improved intestinal blood flow and could normalize the lactate/pyruvate ratio, a marker of intestinal hypoperfusion. Ke et al. reported that well-timed DL was associated with lower mortality and improved organ function in an experimental model of severe acute pancreatitis and ACS. If DL was postponed for 12 hours, compared with 6 or 9 hours, more severe organ dysfunction ensued.

This study has a number of limitations. During enrolment, the number of DLs performed for ACS was lower than expected. This may have been due to improved conservative and proactive management of IAH that resulted…

### Nonoperative management of intraabdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome [^115Q8nLp]. World Journal of Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Intraabdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) have detrimental effects on all organ systems and are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. In recent years, the diagnosis and management of these syndromes have evolved tremendously, and the importance of comprehensive strategies to reduce intraabdominal pressure (IAP) has been recognized. All clinicians should be aware of the risk factors that predict the development of IAH/ACS, the appropriate measurement of IAP, and the resuscitation options for managing these highly morbid syndromes.

The nonoperative management of IAH/ACS can be summarized using five therapeutic goals: evacuate intraluminal contents, evacuate intraabdominal space-occupying lesions, improve abdominal wall compliance, optimize fluid administration, and optimize systemic and regional tissue perfusion. Surgical intervention through open abdominal decompression should immediately be pursued for patients with progressive IAH, end-organ dysfunction, and failure that is refractory to these nonoperative therapies. This comprehensive management strategy has been demonstrated to improve patient survival and long-term outcomes.

### Perforated peptic ulcer associated with abdominal compartment syndrome [^116b7UTh]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is defined as an increased intra-abdominal pressure with adverse physiological consequences. Abdominal compartment syndrome caused by a perforated peptic ulcer is rare due to early diagnosis and management. Delayed recognition of a perforated peptic ulcer with pneumoperitoneum, bowel distension, and decreased abdominal wall compliance can create a vicious circle leading to ACS. We report a case of a perforated peptic ulcer associated with ACS.

A 74-year-old man with a history of an old stroke and dementia presented with a distended abdomen, edema of both legs, and cyanosis. Laboratory tests revealed deterioration of liver and kidney function. Abdominal compartment syndrome was suspected, and an imaging study was arranged to find the cause. The study showed pneumoperitoneum, contrast stasis in the heart with decreased caliber of vessels below the abdominal aortic level, and diffuse lymphedema at the abdominal walls. Emergent laparotomy was performed. A perforated peptic ulcer was noted, and gastrorrhaphy was done. The symptoms, along with liver and kidney function, improved immediately after the emergent operation.

Should we use abdominal perfusion pressure (APP) as a resuscitation endpoint? Abdominal perfusion pressure (APP) may be thought of as the abdominal analogue to cerebral perfusion pressure. This measure has previously been suggested as a more accurate predictor of visceral perfusion and a better endpoint for resuscitation than intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) or mean arterial pressure (MAP) alone.

### Decompressive laparotomy for abdominal compartment syndrome [^11379Bh8]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

The effect of decompressive laparotomy on outcomes in patients with abdominal compartment syndrome has been poorly investigated. The aim of this prospective cohort study was to describe the effect of decompressive laparotomy for abdominal compartment syndrome on organ function and outcomes.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective cohort study in adult patients who underwent decompressive laparotomy for abdominal compartment syndrome. The primary endpoints were 28-day and 1-year all-cause mortality. Changes in intra-abdominal pressure and organ function, and laparotomy-related morbidity were secondary endpoints.

- **Results**: Thirty-three patients were included in the study (20 men). Twenty-seven patients were surgical admissions treated for abdominal conditions. The median (I.Q.R.) Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation score was 26 (20–32). Median intra-abdominal pressure was 23 (21–27) before decompressive laparotomy, decreasing to 12 (9–15), 13 (8–17), 12 (9–15), and 12 (9–14) after 2, 6, 24, and 72 hours, respectively. Decompressive laparotomy significantly improved oxygenation and urinary output. Survivors showed improvement in organ function scores, but non-survivors did not. Fourteen complications related to the procedure developed in eight of the 33 patients. The abdomen could be closed primarily in 18 patients. The overall 28-day mortality rate was 36 percent (12 of 33), which increased to 55 percent (18 patients) at 1 year. Non-survivors were no different from survivors, except that they tended to be older and on mechanical ventilation.

- **Conclusion**: Decompressive laparotomy reduced intra-abdominal pressure and had an immediate effect on improving organ function in survivors.

### Intra-abdominal hypertension and the abdominal compartment syndrome: Updated consensus definitions and clinical practice guidelines from the World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome [^114K7dsb]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013).

- **Methods**: Evaluation of existing 2006 consensus definitions and risk factors was conducted. In concordance with the levels of agreement appropriate for consensus, all 2006 expert consensus definitions for which more than 80% of the members voted to accept "as is" were retained, while all those with less than 50% acceptance were rejected. Definitions with only 50–80% agreement were revised through ongoing discussion until complete consensus was obtained. Where extensive discussion among subspecialists or other experts was required, special sub-committees were created, including a dedicated Pediatric Guidelines Sub-Committee who reviewed the adult guidelines to determine their generalizability to pediatrics. We also searched the literature to determine which intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) or abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) risk factors proposed in 2006 are now supported by evidence and developed a consensus open abdomen classification system. Further details are presented in Supplement 2.

- **Development of consensus management statements**: We followed GRADE recommendations for guideline developers in order to generate management statements related to IAH/ACS. Using this approach, guidelines committee members first developed structured clinical questions and then defined patient-important outcomes with the assistance of an independent GRADE methodological advisor (R.J.). Questions were based on polling of the World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (WSACS) Executive to redundancy and were formulated according to the Patient, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, and study Design (PICO) format. Systematic review teams subsequently conducted systematic reviews.

### Intra-abdominal hypertension and the abdominal compartment syndrome: Updated consensus definitions and clinical practice guidelines from the World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome [^116qbnn7]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

To update the World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (WSACS) consensus definitions and management statements relating to intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and the abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS), systematic or structured reviews were conducted to identify relevant studies. Updated consensus definitions and management statements were then derived using a modified Delphi method and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines, respectively. The quality of evidence was graded from high (A) to very low (D), and management statements were categorized from strong recommendations (desirable effects clearly outweigh potential undesirable ones) to weaker suggestions (potential risks and benefits of the intervention are less clear).

In reviewing the consensus definitions proposed in 2006, the WSACS defined the open abdomen, lateralization of the abdominal musculature, polycompartment syndrome, and abdominal compliance, proposing an open abdomen classification system. Recommendations included intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) measurement, avoidance of sustained IAH, protocolized IAP monitoring and management, decompressive laparotomy for overt ACS, and negative pressure wound therapy with efforts to achieve same-hospital-stay fascial closure among patients with an open abdomen. Suggestions included the use of medical therapies and percutaneous catheter drainage for treatment of IAH/ACS, considering the association between body position and IAP, and attempts to avoid a positive fluid balance.

### Postoperative gastric dilatation causing abdominal compartment syndrome [^113x4ua6]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

The World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (WSACS) has recently developed consensus definitions outlining standards for intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) measurement as well as diagnostic criteria for intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) based upon both the best available clinical evidence and expert opinion.

An acute and rapid elevation in intra-abdominal pressure exceeding 12 mmHg is considered pathologically elevated and has been termed intra-abdominal hypertension. IAH is graded as follows:

- **Grade I**: IAP 12–15 mmHg
- **Grade II**: IAP 16–20 mmHg
- **Grade III**: IAP 21–25 mmHg
- **Grade IV**: IAP > 25 mmHg

ACS is defined as a sustained IAP > 20 mmHg (with or without an abdominal perfusion pressure [APP] < 60 mmHg) that is associated with new organ dysfunction or failure.

The phrase "abdominal compartment syndrome" was first used by Kron et al. in the early 1980s to describe the physiologic effects of intra-abdominal hypertension complicating a ruptured aortic aneurysm surgery. However, most of our knowledge about this entity has evolved over the past few years.

ACS can develop in both nonsurgical and surgical patients, either preoperatively or postoperatively. Although the incidence of ACS was found to range between 5% and 15% of trauma patients, an increased IAP (18 mmHg) was observed in up to 41% of surgical patients. ACS is most commonly diagnosed in patients sustaining abdominal or pelvic trauma, or suffering some other intra-abdominal hemorrhagic catastrophe. Less common etiologic factors include retroperitoneal hematoma or edema, bowel obstruction, ascites, and necrotizing pancreatitis.

Sustained elevation of intra-abdominal pressure causes increased tension and can have significant clinical implications.

### Intra-abdominal hypertension and the abdominal compartment syndrome: Updated consensus definitions and clinical practice guidelines from the World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome [^117BpunB]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The question of whether we should treat or prevent intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) is discussed (Supplement 10; see 10.1007/s00134–013–2906-z). Intra-abdominal hypertension has consistently been associated with morbidity and mortality in observational studies. However, it remains uncertain whether treating or preventing this condition improves patient outcomes.

- **Statement**: We recommend efforts and/or protocols to avoid sustained IAH as compared to inattention to intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) among critically ill or injured patients (New Management Recommendation 4 [GRADE 1C]).

### The role of the open abdomen procedure in managing severe abdominal sepsis: WSES position paper [^11353YC3]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

The prevention of abdominal compartment syndrome is crucial in managing patients with severe abdominal sepsis. The systemic inflammatory response syndrome, increased vascular permeability, and aggressive crystalloid resuscitation predispose patients to fluid sequestration and formation of peritoneal fluid. In cases of advanced sepsis, patients commonly develop shock bowel, resulting in excessive bowel edema. These physiological changes and the associated forced closure of the abdominal wall can lead to increased intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), ultimately resulting in intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH). Although the pathophysiologic implications of elevated IAP were recognized over 150 years ago, they have been essentially rediscovered only within the last two decades. In 2013, the World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome published practice guidelines for the management of intra-abdominal hypertension, classifying IAP into four grades:

- **Grade I**: IAP 12–15 mmHg
- **Grade II**: IAP 16–20 mmHg
- **Grade III**: IAP 21–25 mmHg
- **Grade IV**: IAP > 25 mmHg

Elevated IAP commonly causes marked deficits in both regional and global perfusion, potentially resulting in significant organ failure. Uncontrolled IAH, with an IAP exceeding 20 mmHg and the onset of new organ failure, leads to abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). This syndrome further affects intra-abdominal organs and has indirect effects on remote organs and systems. ACS is a potentially lethal complication characterized by its impact on the splanchnic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, and central nervous systems. Ventricular filling is reduced due to decreased venous return caused by the compression of the inferior vena cava.

### Intra-abdominal hypertension and the abdominal compartment syndrome [^115bRu9w]. Anaesthesia (2004). Low credibility.

The pressure within the abdominal cavity is normally little more than atmospheric pressure. However, even small increases in intra-abdominal pressure can have adverse effects on renal function, cardiac output, hepatic blood flow, respiratory mechanics, splanchnic perfusion, and intracranial pressure. Although intra-abdominal pressure can be measured directly, this is invasive, and bedside measurement of intra-abdominal pressure is usually achieved via the urinary bladder. This affordable and straightforward approach has been shown to produce results that correlate closely with directly measured abdominal pressures.

Significant increases in intra-abdominal pressure are seen in a wide variety of conditions commonly encountered in the intensive care unit, such as ruptured aortic aneurysm, abdominal trauma, and acute pancreatitis. Abdominal compartment syndrome describes the combination of increased intra-abdominal pressure and end-organ dysfunction. This syndrome has a high mortality, with most deaths resulting from sepsis and multi-organ failure.

Detection of abdominal compartment syndrome requires close surveillance of intra-abdominal pressure in patients thought to be at risk of developing intra-abdominal hypertension. The only available treatment for established abdominal compartment syndrome is decompressive laparotomy. Prevention of abdominal compartment syndrome after laparotomy by adopting an open abdomen approach may be preferable in patients at significant risk of developing intra-abdominal hypertension, but this has not been demonstrated in any large trials.

### Intraabdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome-what you need to know [^113mWGSn]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

Abdominal hypertension is a pathologic elevation in intraabdominal pressure most often seen in critically ill patients with a propensity for progression to abdominal compartment syndrome once organ dysfunction develops. Intraabdominal hypertension alone is an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality, but progression to abdominal compartment syndrome portends a worse prognosis with extremely high mortality rates, even after treatment. Pathologic increases in intraabdominal pressure can cause physiologic changes impacting multiple organ systems both directly and indirectly, which may lead to rapid patient deterioration. As such, critical care providers must be able to identify high-risk patients in order to effectively monitor intraabdominal pressure and provide expeditious, appropriate treatment for these patients when warranted.

While the diagnosis of abdominal compartment syndrome is clinical, the sensitivity of physical examination alone is low, and at-risk patients should undergo intraabdominal pressure monitoring with bladder pressures measured every 4 hours. Changes in intraabdominal pressure or organ function and the time over which these changes develop dictate treatment choice. Management strategies for intraabdominal hypertension focus on reduction of intraabdominal volume, increasing abdominal wall compliance, and optimizing fluid balance, which is a nuanced practice in critically ill patients. There are a multitude of treatment options which may be employed to address the spectrum of intraabdominal hypertension, which ranges from asymptomatic.

In utilizing these guidelines, clinicians should be aware of ongoing developments in medical knowledge. The panelists made great efforts to review the literature broadly and to be aware of ongoing research that could influence recommendations. However, the reviewers focused on completed peer-reviewed studies that were available in the public domain. Although some studies could have been missed, it is unlikely that the exclusion of these studies' results would significantly alter our provided recommendations. Nonetheless, it is probable that new knowledge will require future revision of this work. Given the lack of high-quality evidence on which to base decision-making, this is desirable. Users are reminded to use these guidelines in the context of knowing their patients, acting at the bedside, and considering new data as it becomes available.

### Decompressive laparotomy for abdominal compartment syndrome [^1174bR1B]. The British Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) is a clearly identified cause of organ dysfunction in patients who have had emergency abdominal surgery or suffered severe trauma. It is also increasingly recognized in various other patients receiving intensive care after elective surgical procedures, liver transplantation, massive fluid resuscitation for extra-abdominal trauma, severe burns, and aortic aneurysm repair. The presence of IAH upon admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) is associated with the development of severe organ dysfunction, and its presence in the ICU is an independent predictor of mortality.

The clinical picture that results from sustained IAH with an intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) of 20 mmHg or higher has been described as abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS). Although the pathophysiology of IAH is well understood, the treatment of ACS remains challenging. Few non-surgical options are available. IAH can be caused by intraperitoneal fluid accumulation, and percutaneous drainage may be a valid option in such situations. Gastric and rectal tubes have been used to drain air and gastrointestinal contents with some success, as have ultrafiltration, pain relief, and muscular blocking agents.

Surgical decompression of the abdomen, or decompressive laparotomy (DL), is the only available definitive treatment for ACS. Numerous case reports and case series have been published detailing results, but the exact role of DL remains unclear. Most papers focus on the description of associated parameters.

### Abdominal compartment syndrome secondary to chronic constipation in MECP2 duplication syndrome [^111uoPgu]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is an infrequently encountered life-threatening disorder characterized by elevated abdominal pressure with evidence of new organ dysfunction. It is rarely reported in pediatrics. We describe an extremely unusual presentation of a 13-year-old boy with long-standing constipation who developed ACS, complicated by refractory septic shock and multiorgan failure. He was treated with emergent decompressive laparotomy and supportive critical care. This case highlights the need for early diagnosis and timely management of ACS to improve its outcome.

### Recognition and management of abdominal compartment syndrome in the United Kingdom [^114KFpDH]. Intensive Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) is a condition associated with high mortality if undiagnosed and untreated and is seen in patients managed in intensive care units. Very little is known about the causes, diagnosis, and treatment of this condition in the United Kingdom.

- **Design**: Questionnaire study.

- **Settings**: 222 intensive care units in the UK dealing with acute abdominal conditions.

- **Results**: A total of 127 (57.2%) questionnaires were returned, with 32 from teaching hospitals and 95 from district general hospitals. Among these, 96.9% of teaching hospitals and 72.6% of district general hospitals reported cases of ACS. The conditions most frequently associated with ACS were small and large bowel surgery (67%), vascular surgery (62%), and trauma (60%). ACS was mainly suspected when there was a distended abdomen (98.6%), oliguria (94.5%), and increased ventilatory support (72.2%). The diagnosis was confirmed either clinically (68.4%) or by measuring intra-abdominal pressure (83.7%). The intra-vesical route was the most common method for measuring intra-abdominal pressure. The pressure threshold for diagnosing the condition was variable, ranging from 11 to 50 mmHg. There was significant variation in the number of patients who underwent decompressive procedures.

- **Conclusion**: Fewer patients are diagnosed with ACS in district general hospitals compared to teaching hospitals. The threshold for diagnosing ACS varies across the UK, as does the number of patients receiving decompression, indicating that many doctors remain hesitant to accept this condition. This study suggests that there is a need for further awareness and standardization.

### What's new in the management of severe acute pancreatitis [^116GW27A]. Intensive Care Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

The overall incidence of intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) in patients with severe acute pancreatitis (AP) is around 50–75% and 10–25%, respectively. The development of IAH and ACS in these patients significantly impacts morbidity and mortality. This results from a combined effect of the inflammatory process itself and the iatrogenic aggressive fluid resuscitation. Raised intra-abdominal pressure causes the upward shift of both hemidiaphragms and leads to compression atelectasis and hypercapnia. This, in combination with bilateral pleural effusions, may result in severe hypoxia.

When all non-operative measures fail to decrease intra-abdominal pressure, especially in the setting of primary ACS, one should consider immediate midline decompressive laparotomy since this can be life-saving. Newer and less-invasive methods have been recently suggested. A subcutaneous linea alba fasciotomy (SLAF) can be performed using three short horizontal skin incisions with the peritoneum closed, avoiding a true open abdomen. SLAF needs further clinical evaluation and does result in a giant midline hernia with an associated need for surgery at a later stage.

### Results from the international conference of experts on intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome. II. Recommendations [^115msGgH]. Intensive Care Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) have been increasingly recognized in the critically ill over the past decade. In the absence of consensus definitions and treatment guidelines, the diagnosis and management of IAH and ACS remain variable from institution to institution.

An international consensus group of multidisciplinary critical care specialists convened at the second World Congress on Abdominal Compartment Syndrome to develop practice guidelines for the diagnosis, management, and prevention of IAH and ACS.

Prior to the conference, the authors developed a blueprint for consensus definitions and treatment guidelines, which were refined both during and after the conference. The present article is the second installment of the final report from the 2004 International ACS Consensus Definitions Conference and is endorsed by the World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome.

The prevalence and etiological factors for IAH and ACS are reviewed. Evidence-based medicine treatment guidelines are presented to facilitate the diagnosis and management of IAH and ACS. Recommendations to guide future studies are proposed.

These definitions, guidelines, and recommendations, based upon best evidence and expert opinion, are proposed to assist clinicians in the management of IAH and ACS as well as serve as a reference for future clinical and basic science research.

### Abdominal compartment syndrome: A review [^113VQ8kP]. Pediatric Critical Care Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The aims of this review were to summarize: a) the consensus definitions of normal and pathologic intra-abdominal pressure (IAP); b) the techniques to measure IAP; c) the risk factors for intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS); d) the pathophysiology of ACS; and e) the recommendations for management and prevention of ACS.

PubMed was searched using the terms: ACS, IAH, IAP, and abdominal decompression.

ACS represents the natural progression of end-organ dysfunction caused by increased IAP and develops if IAH is not recognized and treated appropriately. Although the reported incidence of ACS is relatively low in critically ill children (0.6%-4.7%) it may be under-recognized and under-reported. The diagnosis of IAH/ACS depends on a high index of suspicion and accurate and frequent measurement of IAP in patients at risk. Mortality from ACS remains high (50%-60%) even when decompression of the abdomen is performed early, which highlights the importance of detection and treatment of elevated IAP before end-organ damage occurs.

A widespread awareness of the recognition and approach to management and prevention of IAH and ACS is needed among pediatric intensivists so the outcome of these life-threatening disease processes might be improved.

### Intra-abdominal hypertension and the abdominal compartment syndrome: Updated consensus definitions and clinical practice guidelines from the World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome [^113yMjsT]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). High credibility.

Studies have reported that treatment with neostigmine may be effective at inducing colonic decompression among those with colonic pseudo-obstruction. However, no data exist on the effects of pharmacologic promotility therapy on intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) or outcomes among those with intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) or abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS).

- **Statement**: We suggest that neostigmine be used for the treatment of established colonic ileus not responding to other simple measures and associated with IAH (New Management Suggestion 5 [GRADE 2D]).

### The open abdomen in trauma and non-trauma patients: WSES guidelines [^116DkUrW]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for abdominal compartment syndrome, more specifically with respect to decompressive laparotomy, WSES 2018 guidelines recommend performing early fascial and/or abdominal definitive closure as the strategy for management of the open abdomen. This approach should be considered once the requirements for ongoing resuscitation have ceased, source control has been definitively reached, there is no concern regarding intestinal viability, no further surgical re-exploration is needed, and there are no concerns for abdominal compartment syndrome.

### Intra-abdominal hypertension and the abdominal compartment syndrome: Updated consensus definitions and clinical practice guidelines from the World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome [^116v2xiV]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

The purpose of this update was to revise the consensus definitions and management statements from the World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome (WSACS) regarding intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) and the abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS).

To achieve this, systematic or structured reviews were conducted to identify relevant studies on IAH or ACS. Updated consensus definitions and management statements were derived using a modified Delphi method and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines, respectively. The quality of evidence was graded from high (A) to very low (D), and management statements ranged from strong recommendations, where desirable effects clearly outweigh potential undesirable ones, to weaker suggestions, where potential risks and benefits of the intervention are less clear.

In addition to reviewing the consensus definitions proposed in 2006, the WSACS defined several key concepts, including the open abdomen, lateralization of the abdominal musculature, polycompartment syndrome, and abdominal compliance. They proposed an open abdomen classification system.

- **Recommendations**: Intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) measurement, avoidance of sustained IAH, protocolized IAP monitoring and management, decompressive laparotomy for overt ACS, negative pressure wound therapy, and efforts to achieve same-hospital-stay fascial closure among patients with an open abdomen.

- **Suggestions**: Use of medical therapies and percutaneous catheter drainage for the treatment of IAH/ACS, considering the association between body position and IAP, and attempts to avoid a positive fluid balance.

### Survey of intensive care physicians on the recognition and management of intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome [^112XLVN6]. Critical Care Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the understanding and clinical management of intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome among critical care physicians. The design involved a ten-question written survey conducted at a university health sciences center. Subjects included physician members of the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM).

The interventions consisted of distributing the survey to 4,538 SCCM members, achieving a response rate of 35.7% (1622 respondents).

- **Measurements and main results**: Primary training, intensive care unit type, and methods for managing abdominal compartment syndrome were assessed. It was found that surgically trained intensivists managed the highest number of abdominal compartment syndrome cases, with 47% managing 4–10 cases and 16% managing more than 10 cases. In contrast, 25% of medically trained and pediatric-trained intensivists reported seeing no cases at all.

	- Respondents agreed on the necessity of both bladder pressures and clinical variables for diagnosing abdominal compartment syndrome, with 70% supporting this combined approach compared to 7% favoring bladder pressure alone and 20% favoring clinical variables alone. Awareness of a bladder pressure measurement procedure was lacking in 2% of surgical intensivists, compared with 24% (p < .0001) of pediatric and 23% (p < .0001) of medical intensivists.

	- Regarding physiologic compromise, 42% of respondents believed that bladder pressures of 20–27 mm Hg could cause it. However, 25–27% of pediatric, medicine, or anesthesia-trained intensivists believed compromise occurred at bladder pressures between 12 and 19 mm Hg, compared to only 18% of surgeons. No respondent believed that physiologic compromise occurred at pressures less than 8 mm Hg.

Unfortunately, the text seems to have been cut off at the end.

Diuretics are commonly used to improve fluid balance among the critically ill; however, it remains unknown whether they improve outcomes among those with intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH) or abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS).

- **Statement**: We could make no recommendation regarding the use of diuretics to mobilize fluids in hemodynamically stable patients with IAH after acute resuscitation has been completed and the inciting issues have been addressed.

### International cross-sectional survey on current and updated definitions of intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome [^1127LLqt]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2024). Low credibility.

- **Geographical representation**: The respondents of the cross-sectional survey are displayed geographically in this section.

- **Pathophysiology of intra-abdominal hypertension**: Respondents' agreement with statements on the pathophysiology of intra-abdominal hypertension and the measurement of intra-abdominal pressure is illustrated. Key terms include MAP (mean arterial pressure), IAP (intra-abdominal pressure), FG (filtration gradient), GFP (glomerular filtration pressure), APP (abdominal perfusion pressure), PTP (proximal tubular pressure), Cab (abdominal compliance), RVP (renal venous pressure), IAPei (IAP end-inspiratory), IAPee (IAP end-expiratory), HOB (head-of-bed), and RAV (respiratory-abdominal variation). Statements marked as (new) are candidate statements for future revision of guidelines.

- **Definition and management**: The respondents' agreement on the definition and management of intra-abdominal hypertension and abdominal compartment syndrome is discussed. Important concepts include ACS (abdominal compartment syndrome), IAH (intra-abdominal hypertension), IAP (intra-abdominal pressure), APP (abdominal perfusion pressure), SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment), qSOFA (quick SOFA), and TAC (temporary abdominal closure). Statements labeled as (new) indicate potential revisions for future guidelines.

A total of 1039 respondents (99%) provided feedback on the future of WSACS. A majority (n = 700, 67.4%) believe that the society should continue fostering education, training, and promoting research on IAH and ACS. A minority (89, 8.5%) felt that WSACS should integrate with another society.

- **Future role**: The distribution of respondents' opinions on the future role of the Abdominal Compartment Society is presented. WSACS refers to the Abdominal Compartment Society.

### The open abdomen in trauma and non-trauma patients: WSES guidelines [^115V4v8A]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2018). High credibility.

When addressing surgical interventions for abdominal compartment syndrome, particularly in relation to decompressive laparotomy, the WSES 2018 guidelines advise considering the open abdominal approach as a viable option for emergency surgery. This recommendation is specifically for patients with severe peritonitis and severe sepsis/septic shock, especially in scenarios involving visceral edema, where there is a concern for the development of abdominal compartment syndrome.

### Intra-abdominal hypertension and the abdominal compartment syndrome: Updated consensus definitions and clinical practice guidelines from the World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome [^112PfwUU]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). High credibility.

Use of the open abdomen after trauma damage control laparotomy is discussed in this supplement.

The damage control approach to trauma involves an abbreviated resuscitative surgical technique, with the primary goal being rapid control of hemorrhage and contamination while restoring metabolic function even at the expense of normal anatomy. Damage control laparotomy is typically a component of a larger damage control approach that also includes damage control resuscitation. Although it remains difficult to prove that this approach improves mortality and other outcomes, it has been associated with unexpected patient survival.

- **Management suggestion**: We suggest that patients undergoing laparotomy for trauma and suffering from physiological exhaustion be treated with the prophylactic use of the open abdomen versus closure and expectant intra-abdominal pressure management [New Management Suggestion 9, GRADE 2D].

Should we attempt to achieve same-hospital-stay closure of the open abdomen? (Supplement 26; see 10.1007/s00134–013–2906-z)

As the inability to achieve primary fascial closure after damage control laparotomy has been associated with increased morbidity and reduced quality of life among critically ill adults, efforts to close the abdominal fascia before discharge could potentially lead to improved outcomes.

- **Statement**: We recommend that among ICU patients with open abdominal wounds, conscious and/or protocolized efforts be made to obtain an early or at least same-hospital-stay abdominal fascial closure (New Management Recommendation 6 [GRADE 1D]).

### Intra-abdominal hypertension and the abdominal compartment syndrome: Updated consensus definitions and clinical practice guidelines from the World Society of the Abdominal Compartment Syndrome [^114XYpBf]. Intensive Care Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Should we use PCD? (Supplement 21; see 10.1007/s00134–013–2906-z)

Although paracentesis has long been a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure among those without documented intra-abdominal hypertension (IAH), the insertion of an indwelling percutaneous drainage catheter (PCD) to improve intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) and patient-important outcomes among those with IAH or abdominal compartment syndrome (ACS) was suggested only in 2001.

- **Statement**: We suggest the use of PCD to remove fluid (in the setting of obvious intra-peritoneal fluid) in those with IAH or ACS when this is technically possible compared to doing nothing (Unchanged Management Suggestion 8 [GRADE 2C]). We also suggest using PCD to remove fluid (in the setting of obvious intraperitoneal fluid) in those with IAH or ACS when this is technically possible compared to immediate decompressive laparotomy, as this may alleviate the need for decompressive laparotomy (Revised Management Suggestion 8 [GRADE 2D]).
