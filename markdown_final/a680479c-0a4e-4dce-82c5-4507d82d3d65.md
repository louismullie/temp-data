## Question

Rectal bleeding on one occasion in a 12 year old

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for guidance on evaluating and managing a 12-year-old with a single episode of rectal bleeding. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate triage and hemodynamic stability. Then, I should verify the key elements of history that narrow the differential. Next, I will examine the child with a focused anorectal and abdominal assessment. After that, I need to decide on initial laboratory testing. Then, I will construct an age-specific differential diagnosis and prioritize likely causes. Finally, I will outline management pathways for common benign causes versus when to escalate to endoscopy or imaging, and close with follow-up and safety-netting advice [^114GTeLr] [^114QVy2W].

> Let me first confirm the triage priorities: airway, breathing, circulation, and mental status, because even a single episode can herald significant blood loss in children, and I should not anchor on benign causes too early. I need to check for tachycardia, hypotension, pallor, lethargy, and orthostatic symptoms; if unstable, I should activate hemorrhage protocols, obtain IV access, and initiate crystalloid and blood products as indicated while planning urgent source control, ideally with pediatric GI and surgery involvement [^114j2xMC] [^113eJbWW].

> Next, I should review the history in a structured way, and I need to ensure I do not miss red flags. I will ask about the color and amount of blood, whether it coated the stool or mixed within, and whether there was pain with defecation, because painless bright red coating suggests an anorectal source while mixed dark red blood raises concern for more proximal disease. I should confirm associated symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, fever, mucus, tenesmus, and constipation or straining, and I must screen for family history of polyps, inflammatory bowel disease, or hereditary cancer syndromes, as well as medication exposures including NSAIDs, anticoagulants, and isotretinoin, which can precipitate IBD-like colitis and bleeding [^114GTeLr] [^114QVy2W] [^1169foQc].

> Hold on, I should verify the age-specific context here. At 12 years, solitary rectal ulcer syndrome, juvenile polyps, and inflammatory bowel disease rise in prominence, whereas classic pediatric surgical emergencies like intussusception are less likely but not impossible, so I must keep a broad differential while weighting probabilities appropriately [^116R4dg3] [^113vuUh8].

> I will now examine the patient with a focused anorectal and abdominal assessment. I need to inspect the anus for fissures, external hemorrhoids, and prolapsing tissue, and perform a gentle digital rectal exam to feel for masses, tenderness, or blood characteristics, while remembering that a DRE can help distinguish anorectal sources from more proximal bleeding and guide next steps. I should palpate the abdomen for tenderness, mass, or distension, and I must check for pallor, tachycardia, and other signs of anemia or hypovolemia, documenting vitals and a general appearance that reassures or alarms me [^111ndzB7] [^116ZDTPq] [^114QVy2W].

> Let me consider initial investigations, and I should be careful not to over-order tests in a stable child with a likely benign cause. A complete blood count can screen for anemia or leukocytosis, and a basic metabolic panel can assess hydration and electrolytes; coagulation studies are reasonable if there is a bleeding history or medication risk. If I suspect IBD, I should add inflammatory markers and consider fecal calprotectin, recognizing that a normal calprotectin makes active colonic inflammation less likely and may help defer endoscopy in low-risk presentations [^114j2xMC] [^115Zohc4] [^113ukuSa].

> Now, I will construct the differential diagnosis and prioritize by likelihood and severity. Benign anorectal causes such as anal fissure, juvenile polyp, and internal hemorrhoids are common and often present with painless bright red blood coating stools; solitary rectal ulcer syndrome is prevalent in early adolescence and classically features bleeding with straining, mucus, tenesmus, and dyssynergic defecation. Inflammatory bowel disease becomes more likely with diarrhea, abdominal pain, weight loss, nocturnal symptoms, or extraintestinal features, and at this age I should also keep in mind polyposis syndromes, infectious colitis, vascular malformations, and rare malignancies, adjusting pretest probabilities based on history and exam [^113ZsPyU] [^1144YjvF] [^115Zohc4] [^116R4dg3].

> Wait, let me verify the role of family history and genetics because this can pivot management. If there is a family history of familial adenomatous polyposis or other hereditary polyposis, guidelines support predictive genetic testing around age 12–14 and earlier colonoscopic evaluation if symptomatic with rectal bleeding, given the risk of early adenoma formation and the rare but real possibility of early cancer in FAP; I should not delay referral in that scenario [^114Dexig] [^1137g2xL] [^111wrUDZ].

> For initial management of likely benign causes, I should start with conservative therapy while ensuring close follow-up. For constipation-associated bleeding or suspected fissure, I will recommend increased fluids, dietary fiber, and osmotic laxatives such as polyethylene glycol, and I will avoid irritant laxatives like senna beyond short-term use. I need to ensure the caregiver knows to return urgently for recurrent bleeding, anemia symptoms, fever, weight loss, nocturnal symptoms, or mucus-laden stools, and I should arrange review within 1–2 weeks to confirm improvement and reassess the need for further workup [^114GTeLr] [^113dWHsU].

> But wait, what if the bleeding persists, recurs, or is accompanied by red flags. I should double-check my threshold for endoscopy: persistent or recurrent bleeding, anemia, weight loss, nocturnal symptoms, diarrhea, abdominal pain, mucus, or a family history of polyps or IBD should prompt colonoscopy rather than limited sigmoidoscopy, because total colonoscopy increases diagnostic yield for polyps and IBD and avoids missing proximal disease. Pre-endoscopic preparation with polyethylene glycol is essential for visualization and safety, and I should coordinate with pediatric anesthesia when needed [^113xW57r] [^115SsWzA] [^1121CxEt].

> Let me reconsider the likelihood of specific endoscopic diagnoses to guide counseling. Juvenile polyps are a leading cause of painless rectal bleeding in children, often solitary and in the rectosigmoid, with a high cure rate after polypectomy; solitary rectal ulcer syndrome is common in early adolescents and responds variably to behavioral and local therapy; and IBD must be actively excluded when systemic features or persistent symptoms are present, with biopsies guiding classification and therapy [^113ZsPyU] [^1144YjvF] [^115Zohc4].

> I need to ensure I do not overlook rare but serious causes. Although intussusception peaks in infancy, it can occur in older children and may present with bleeding and abdominal pain; Meckel diverticulum can cause significant lower GI bleeding; vascular malformations, including caecal AVM, have been reported in adolescents with massive bleeding; and malignancies such as rectal lymphoma or colon cancer are rare but documented in this age group, particularly with atypical features or mass lesions, so I should maintain vigilance when the story deviates from benign patterns [^113sr63U] [^1125QbGd] [^113eJbWW] [^116o65UP].

> Next, I should review follow-up and safety-netting. I will provide clear return precautions for ongoing bleeding, syncope, pallor, fatigue, weight loss, fever, or changing bowel habits, and I will schedule a check-in within 1–2 weeks to confirm symptom resolution and adherence to bowel management. If symptoms persist or evolve, I should expedite referral to pediatric gastroenterology for colonoscopy and targeted therapy, documenting the initial episode and response to conservative measures to inform escalation decisions [^114GTeLr] [^115Zohc4].

> In summary, I should stabilize first if there are any hemodynamic concerns, then use history and exam to stratify risk and guide testing, favoring conservative management for likely benign causes while maintaining a low threshold for colonoscopy in the presence of red flags or recurrence, and I must keep age-specific differentials and hereditary risks in mind to avoid both under- and over-investigation in this 12-year-old [^114j2xMC] [^114GTeLr] [^114QVy2W].

A single episode of rectal bleeding in a 12-year-old is most often due to **benign causes** such as anal fissure, juvenile polyp, or constipation-related mucosal trauma [^114GTeLr] [^113ZsPyU]. Immediate evaluation should include a **focused history**, **physical exam** (including DRE) [^111ndzB7], and **CBC** to assess for anemia or infection [^114j2xMC]. Most cases resolve spontaneously, but persistent or recurrent bleeding warrants colonoscopy to exclude polyps, IBD, or other pathology [^113xW57r] [^115SsWzA]. Red flags (pallor, weight loss, fever, severe pain, or hemodynamic instability) require **urgent referral** [^112iLEwD] [^114QVy2W].

## Common causes of rectal bleeding in adolescents

Rectal bleeding in adolescents is **typically benign**, though rare serious conditions must be considered [^114GTeLr]:

| **Category** | **Common causes** | **Rare but serious causes** |
|-|-|-|
| Anorectal | - Anal fissure <br/> - Hemorrhoids <br/> - Constipation-related mucosal trauma | - Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome [^1144YjvF] <br/> - Cap polyposis [^112Ucj1G] |
| Colonic | - Juvenile polyps [^113ZsPyU] <br/> - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [^115Zohc4] <br/> - Infectious colitis [^112qkNKf] | - Vascular malformations [^113eJbWW] <br/> - Meckel's diverticulum [^111RwNoF] <br/> - Malignancy (e.g. lymphoma) [^116o65UP] |

## Initial evaluation and diagnostic approach

### Clinical history

Characterize the bleeding by onset, duration, frequency, volume, and color (**bright red vs dark/maroon**) [^114QVy2W]. Assess associated symptoms — abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation, weight loss, fever, mucus, tenesmus, and recent travel or sick contacts [^notfound]. Review medical history for constipation, IBD, bleeding disorders, recent infections, and medications (**NSAIDs, anticoagulants**) [^114QVy2W]. Obtain a family history of IBD, polyps, or **malignancy** [^114Dexig].

---

### Physical examination

Perform a general exam to assess for pallor, tachycardia, **hypotension**, fever, and signs of anemia [^114QVy2W]. Conduct an **abdominal exam** for tenderness, masses, or distension. Perform an anorectal exam with inspection for fissures, hemorrhoids, or prolapse, and a **digital rectal exam (DRE)** to palpate for masses or tenderness [^111ndzB7].

---

### Laboratory investigations

Order a **complete blood count (CBC)** to evaluate for anemia, leukocytosis, or thrombocytopenia [^111ndzB7]. Consider **coagulation studies (PT/INR, aPTT)** if a bleeding disorder is suspected [^111ndzB7]. Obtain stool studies (**fecal calprotectin**, culture, ova and parasites) if infection or inflammation is suspected [^113ukuSa].

---

## Indications for further diagnostic testing

Further testing is indicated if any of the following are present:

- Persistent or recurrent bleeding [^115SsWzA].
- Suspected polyp or mass (prolapse, mucus, tenesmus) [^113ZsPyU].
- Systemic symptoms (weight loss, fever, anemia) [^114QVy2W].
- Family history of polyps, IBD, or malignancy [^114Dexig].

---

### Colonoscopy

Colonoscopy is the **gold standard** for evaluating persistent or recurrent rectal bleeding, suspected polyps, IBD, or malignancy [^113xW57r] [^115SsWzA]. It allows direct visualization, biopsy, and polypectomy. Adequate bowel preparation is essential for optimal visualization and diagnostic yield [^1121CxEt].

---

### Imaging studies

Imaging is reserved for specific indications: ultrasound or MRI for suspected vascular malformations or structural anomalies, and CT angiography or radionuclide scanning (e.g. Meckel scan) for active bleeding when endoscopy is inconclusive or not feasible [^112HhBf3] [^111q7fRc].

---

## Management strategies

Management depends on the **underlying cause**:

- **Anal fissure/constipation**: Conservative management with dietary fiber, fluids, stool softeners, and topical agents [^113ukuSa].
- **Juvenile polyp**: Endoscopic polypectomy [^112bLtFV].
- **IBD**: Medical therapy (aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunomodulators, biologics) and nutritional support [^115Zohc4].
- **Infectious colitis**: Targeted antimicrobial therapy [^notfound].
- **Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome**: Behavioral modification, bulk laxatives, and local therapy (steroid or sucralfate enemas) [^1144YjvF].

---

## Prognosis and recurrence

Prognosis is **excellent** for most benign causes (fissures, hemorrhoids, juvenile polyps) [^1171YLTt]. Recurrence is common with chronic constipation or untreated IBD; ongoing management and follow-up are essential [^115Zohc4].

---

## Parental education and counseling

Parents should be educated about common benign causes and the importance of hydration, fiber intake, and regular bowel habits [^112YDorv]. They should also be instructed to seek urgent care for red flags (pallor, weight loss, severe pain, fever, hemodynamic instability) [^114QVy2W].

---

A single episode of rectal bleeding in a 12-year-old is **usually benign** (fissure, polyp, constipation) [^1171YLTt]. A focused history, exam, and CBC are the initial steps; persistent or recurrent bleeding warrants colonoscopy [^113xW57r]. Most cases resolve with conservative care, but red flags require urgent evaluation [^112iLEwD].

### Fifteen-minute consultation: rectal bleeding in children [^114GTeLr]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2023). Medium credibility.

Bleeding per rectum in children is an infrequent presentation associated with a wide range of differential diagnoses, from benign to life-threatening. Irrespective of the underlying aetiology, it is typically a worrisome symptom for caregivers. Published data are limited, particularly for the UK population, from which to provide clear evidence-based guidance for assessment and management of infants, children and young people presenting with bleeding per rectum. In this Fifteen-Minute Consultation, we therefore explore the common aetiologies and combine opinions from acute paediatrics, paediatric gastroenterology and paediatric surgery to offer a structure for a diagnostic approach and initial management of lower gastrointestinal bleeding in infants, children and young people.

### The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons clinical practice guidelines for the management of inherited adenomatous polyposis syndromes [^114Dexig]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2024). High credibility.

Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) testing of at-risk relatives and pediatric surveillance: At-risk family members of a polyposis patient with an identified pathologic variant should typically undergo testing for the known familial pathogenic variant (Strength of recommendation: strong based on low-quality evidence). Predictive genetic testing should be offered to at-risk children at the age of 12 to 14 years, and children confirmed to have FAP or considered at risk without genetic testing should have surveillance colonoscopy starting at the age of 12 to 14 years; if symptomatic with rectal bleeding or mucous discharge, a colonoscopy should be considered at any age. It is reasonable for colonoscopy to be repeated every 2 years until the age of 20 years and, in the absence of adenomas, surveillance intervals can be gradually extended. Contextual risk data state that overall, colorectal cancer risk is nearly 100%, with an average age of diagnosis being 39 years; colorectal cancer has not been reported before the age of 9 years in patients with FAP, and pooled European registry data found that only 0.2% developed cancer before the age of 15 years and 1.3% before the age of 20 years.

### Investigating painless rectal bleeding – is there scope for improvement? [^113xW57r]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2005). Low credibility.

Introduction

Most patients with recurrent painless rectal bleeding warrant endoscopic examination of the lower gastrointestinal tract. This is often limited to rectum or distal colon. The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic yield of limited colorectal endoscopy with total colonoscopy in children with recurrent painless rectal bleeding.

Methods

Retrospective review of 314 patients aged 1 to 15 years who underwent colorectal endoscopy for recurrent rectal bleeding. Two hundred six underwent total colonoscopy, whereas 108 patients had endoscopy limited to the rectum in 22, sigmoid colon in 34, descending colon in 43, and transverse colon in 9. Diagnoses were recorded according to the endoscopic and histological findings.

Results

After total colonoscopy, a diagnosis was established in 70% of children compared with 35% of those undergoing limited endoscopy (P < .001). This difference was most noticeable in children with inflammatory bowel disease. Juvenile polyps were diagnosed with similar frequency in both groups, reflecting the rectosigmoid distribution of most polyps.

Conclusions

For children presenting with painless rectal bleeding, a diagnosis can be established in the majority if total colonoscopy is performed. This is particularly true for inflammatory bowel disease. Unless a rectal polyp is suspected, full colonoscopy should be planned.

### Bleeding from a gut lesion as a cause of seizure [^111ZHxGa]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

The differential diagnosis of causes of seizure is important since appropriate management depends on correct diagnosis. Making a misdiagnosis of epilepsy may lead to erroneous clinical management, and can be minimised with careful history taking and physical examination. Our educational case illustrates a patient with presumed epilepsy based on a witnessed generalised tonic-clonic seizure; he was ultimately diagnosed as upper gastrointestinal bleeding initially considered by careful attention of vital signs and rectal examination, and confirmed and treated by emergent endoscopy. Paying careful attention to the symptoms and signs in patients with seizure episodes is crucial to establishing a correct causative diagnosis for seizure.

### A rare cause of severe rectal bleeding: solitary rectal ulcer syndrome [^115vGTcU]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2014). Low credibility.

Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome is a rare benign disorder in children which often goes unrecognized or easily misdiagnosed with other common diseases. It usually presents with rectal bleeding, constipation, mucous discharge, prolonged straining, tenesmus, and lower abdominal pain. The rectal bleeding varies from a little fresh blood to severe hemorrhage that requires blood transfusion. We report herein a pediatric case of solitary rectal ulcer syndrome who admitted to pediatric emergency department with severe rectal bleeding for reminding this rare syndrome.

### Does painless rectal bleeding equate to a colonic polyp? [^113ZsPyU]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2017). Low credibility.

Background

It is often stated that if a patient presents with 'painless rectal bleeding' then a rectal polyp is the probable diagnosis. The aim of this study is to review our experience of children undergoing endoscopy to assess if the above statement is correct.

Methods

The senior author keeps a prospective database of every child undergoing flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. As part of this database, the symptoms and signs that the patient presents with, specifically abdominal pain, diarrhoea, mucous per rectum and rectal bleeding, are recorded. These results have been analysed specifically to assess whether the opening statement is correct.

Results

Between 2000 and 2014, a total of 401 children have undergone flexible sigmoidoscopy (21) or colonoscopy (380) to investigate rectal bleeding. Of these 401 patients, 42 (10.5%) had at least one polyp. Four polyps (9%) occurred in 159 patients with no rectal bleeding during the study period. The remaining 42 polyps (91%) were identified in patients with rectal bleeding. Of these 42 polyps, painless rectal bleeding was the only symptom in 24 (57%). However, 123 patients were endoscoped with painless rectal bleeding alone, giving a polyp rate of 19.5% for this symptom. The polyp pickup rate was increased to 28% if rectal bleeding and mucous per rectum were present; however, only 25 patients had this clinical history.

Conclusion

We confirm that the most common symptom of rectal polyps is painless rectal bleeding. However, only one in five patients with this clinical history has a rectal polyp at endoscopy. The polyp pickup rate at endoscopy is greater (28%) when a history of both rectal bleeding and mucous per rectumispresent. This information can be used to counsel parents preoperatively.

### Solitary rectal ulcer: a rare cause of gastrointestinal bleeding in an adolescent with hemophilia a… [^1116GhYy]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2001). Low credibility.

Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome (SRUS) is a rarely reported condition in children. The typical presentation is one of anorectal pain with passage of blood and mucus per rectum in the setting of defecation abnormalities. Diagnosis is made via endoscopy and biopsy. Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome alone is usually a benign condition; however, significant morbidity can occur if complicated by underlying disease states. We report an adolescent with hemophilia A and SRUS who presented with a rectal bleed that required blood transfusion.

### Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome in childhood: a rare, benign, and probably misdiagnosed cause of rectal bleeding. report of three cases [^114132bT]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2007). Low credibility.

Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome is an uncommon and often underdiagnosed condition that usually presents with hematochezia, mucous discharge, and tenesmus. Its etiology is unknown but it seems related to excessive straining with defecation. Prolonged efforts force the anterior rectal mucosa into the anal canal with strangulation and appearance of congestion, edema, and ulceration. Histologic findings (fibromuscular obliteration of lamina propria and disorientation of muscle fibers) are characteristic, which helps to differentiate these lesions from other rectal entities. Although solitary rectal ulcer syndrome is rarely reported in children, it must be suspected in patients with rectal discharge of blood and mucus and previous disorders of evacuation. We present three children (aged 9, 10, and 14 years) with solitary rectal ulcer syndrome that had presented with rectal bleeding. A careful inquiry about evacuation habits and a high index of suspicion in children presenting with hematochezia helps to diagnose this possibly unrecognized or misdiagnosed entity in children. Endoscopy and histologic examination confirms this condition.

### Lower gastrointestinal bleeding in children [^112iLEwD]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2002). Low credibility.

Lower gastrointestinal bleeding is a common problem in the practice of general pediatrics. The differential diagnosis can be extensive and varies according to the age of the child. A specific diagnosis can usually be made with a thorough history, physical examination, simple laboratory investigations, and appropriate diagnostic studies. Treatment should be directed at the underlying cause. In most children, bleeding ceases spontaneously, and only supportive therapy is necessary. If there is evidence of hypovolemia, the patient must be hemodynamically stabilized, active bleeding stopped, and recurrent bleeding prevented.

### Juvenile polyp presenting with rectal bleeding in a 2-year-old girl [^113vPzRF]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

A retrospective chart review on 77 children and adolescents with colorectal polyps seen over a 15-year period (1980–1994) recurrence was observed in five of 63 patients (7.9%) with juvenile polyps, in one patient with infantile polyposis, and in one with solitary adenomatous polyp. Authors suggested that a full colonoscopic evaluation should be performed in all patients with suspected polyps if feasible, for multiple polyps occurred in 35% of children without polyposis syndromes in this series. Parents of patients with more than three polyps and/or a family history of juvenile polyposis should be warned regarding the possibility of an increased risk of malignancy in future if polyps continue to recur.

Histopathologic examination of any removed polyp is important to detect any dysplastic or adenomatous element with malignant potential and to make a suitable follow-up schedule when appropriate.

### Visual diagnosis: 12-year-old girl with constipation and rectal bleeding [^115rhVK8]. Pediatrics in Review (2014). Low credibility.

Rectal duplication cysts are rare, thought to be due to defects in embryologic development, and often associated with other structural abnormalities. Clues to the existence of a rectal cyst are mainly due to bowel compression and presence of ectopic gastric mucosa within the cyst, leading to rectal bleeding. The diagnosis of a rectal duplication cyst requires a high index of suspicion. Confirming the diagnosis can be difficult based on the location of the cyst. Efforts to confirm the diagnosis include digital rectal examination, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography, and Meckel scan. Surgical resection is the treatment of choice, especially because of the cyst's potential for malignant transformation. Because of the cyst's proximal location to the nerves innervating the anal canal and sphincters, surgical resection can lead to fecal incontinence.

### Bleeding due to successive duodenal and rectal ulcers in an 81-year-old patient with severe COVID-19: a case report [^115nAzMh]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious and has caused a global pandemic in recent years. Patients with COVID-19 may exhibit symptoms, ranging from mild, flu-like symptoms to severe symptoms, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, and multiple organ failure. Age, sex, and the presence of underlying diseases are all relevant factors in determining disease severity. Older patients with COVID-19 are at a higher risk of severe complications and adverse outcomes, often requiring ICU treatment. Published reports on patients with COVID-19 have previously focused on gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting, diarrhoea, anorexia, abdominal pain, and upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and no reports of rectal ulcer bleeding in patients with severe COVID-19 exist. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of an older patient who developed both duodenal and rectal ulcer bleeding while treating severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. Severe bleeding was controlled with systemic treatment.

### Massive per rectal bleeding in a child due to caecal arteriovenous malformation treated successfully by embolisation [^113eJbWW]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 12-year-old girl presented with a sudden onset of per rectal bleeding. After admission, she had further episodes of large volume per rectal bleeding and developed hypotensive shock. Hence a massive haemorrhage protocol was activated. Surgical, paediatric and anaesthetic support was sought immediately. Further resuscitation with packed red cells, platelets and fresh frozen plasma was successful. An urgent CT angiogram of the abdomen confirmed active arterial bleeding from an arteriovenous malformation in the caecum. After a detailed discussion between the surgeons and the interventional radiologists, it was decided to attempt therapeutic embolisation first, failing which surgery was the option. The patient and family were fully informed. Through a right femoral approach under local anaesthesia, the superior mesenteric artery was catheterised and the bleeding vessel was successfully controlled with two microembolisation coils. Except for some initial abdominal discomfort, she made an uneventful recovery and was discharged home.

### Diagnosis and management of cancer risk in the gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyposis syndromes: recommendations from the Us Multi-society Task Force on Colorectal Cancer [^111wrUDZ]. Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Juvenile polyposis syndrome — endoscopic surveillance and polyp management include defined ages, intervals, and size thresholds. Colonoscopy should be first performed at age 12–15 years and repeated every 1–3 years depending on polyp burden, with removal of all polyps when feasible or at least all polyps ≥ 5 mm. Upper endoscopy should be first performed at age 12–15 years and repeated every 1–3 years with removal of polyps ≥ 5 mm. Due to possible intestinal telangiectasias in SMAD4 carriers, an annual history and physical examination and complete blood counts to monitor for rectal bleeding and/or anemia should begin at age 12–15 years. We suggest initiating colonoscopic and upper endoscopic surveillance at age 12–15 years, or earlier if symptomatic. Surveillance should be repeated every 1–3 years depending on polyp burden. (Weak recommendation, low quality of evidence)

### Solitary rectal ulcer transformation to cap polyposis in a 15-year-old child [^113WzonV]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

As previously stated, CP, even in adults, is considered a rare disease, with fewer than 100 cases reported until 2017. They are most frequently reported in patients in their fifth decade of life, with a slight predominance in women aged 12 to 76 years. However, children may also be impacted. Evidently, the youngest child reported was 11 months old, and another study by Li et al. found that the affected child's median age was 13 years. Although the exact pathophysiology of CP is unknown, inflammation, infection, particularly Helicobacter pylori, and abnormal intestinal motility have all been suggested as possible mechanisms, primarily due to the disease's similarities to other diseases such as IBD.

Rectal bleeding was the most frequently reported clinical manifestation in children, followed by mucoid discharge, constipation, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. Tenesmus, straining during defecation, the sensation of incomplete defecation, the need for manual stool evacuation, weight loss, and protein-losing enteropathy have all been reported in various studies at differing prevalence rates. Additionally, our patient presented with rectal bleeding, mucoid discharge, abdominal pain, and a five-year history of straining during defecation, progressing in severity over time. Although anemia, changes in serum inflammatory markers, and a decrease in total serum protein or albumin levels have been reported in some cases, our patient had no laboratory abnormalities.

Almost all lesions found during colonoscopy evaluation of adults or children are located in the rectum, occasionally extending to the anal canal, and less frequently in the sigmoid colon. However, Stomach involvement is reported in the adult-only. Our patient's involvement was restricted to the rectum, with no extension to the proximal or distal sections. Sessile, pedunculated, ulcerated, or flat lesions are all possible presentations of lesions of varying sizes and numbers.

As mentioned previously, our patient had multiple polyposis lesions ranging in size from 5 to 15 mm. CP is characterized histopathologically by hyperplastic crypts that are attenuated toward the ulcerated mucosal surface and covered in a thick layer of fibrinopurulent exudate. However, there are some similarities with other diseases such as IBD and mucosal prolapse syndrome, which results in frequent misdiagnosis and unnecessary or harmful evaluations or therapeutic strategies.

Rectal bleeding is an alarming event both for the child and parents. It is hypothesized that colonoscopy instead of sigmoidoscopy and adding esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy in case of accompanying complaints, improves the diagnostic accuracy in children with prolonged rectal bleeding.

Study Design

All pediatric patients undergoing colonoscopy because of prolonged rectal bleeding over an 8-year period at the Emma Children's Hospital/Academic Medical Centre were reviewed. Patient demographics, clinical features, number and extent of endoscopic examinations and the endoscopic and histopathological findings were assessed.

Results

A total of 147 colonoscopies were performed in 137 pediatric patients (63 boys) because of prolonged rectal bleeding. Inflammatory bowel disease and polyp(s) were the most prevalent diagnoses. In 72% of patients diagnosed as Crohn's disease, focal, chronically active gastritis was seen on histology, giving support to the diagnosis Crohn's disease. In 22% of the cases polyps would have been missed in the case where only sigmoidoscopy was performed. No complications after endoscopic intervention were seen.

Conclusions

Colonoscopy is the investigation of choice in children with prolonged rectal bleeding. In patients presenting with accompanying complaints such as abdominal pain or diarrhea, it is advisable to perform ileocolonoscopy combined with esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy. This combines a high diagnostic yield with a safe procedure.

### Solitary rectal ulcer transformation to cap polyposis in a 15-year-old child [^112Ucj1G]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cap polyposis (CP) is a rare benign inflammatory condition characterized by colorectal polyps with a fibrinopurulent mucoid cap. Due to its rarity, the incidence rate is unknown, but most reported cases are men or women in their fifth decade of life, and there have been fewer than 100 reported cases of children affected by this disorder worldwide.

Rectal bleeding and mucoid discharge are the most frequently reported symptoms, prompting colonoscopy to rule out other possibilities such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), malignancies, and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). During colonoscopy evaluation, single or multiple polyps varying in size and shape in the rectum or colon may be observed, raising the possibility of cap polyposis. A definitive diagnosis requires the collection of numerous tissue samples in order to confirm the disease histologically. We present a case of solitary rectal ulcer (SRU) in a 15-year-old boy that developed into CP over time. He complained of worsening symptoms associated with his initial diagnosis of SRU, including rectal bleeding, constipation, and mucoid discharge. Colonoscopy revealed numerous polyps of various sizes and shapes throughout the rectum, and histopathologic examination confirmed the diagnosis.

Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2018). Medium credibility.

Pediatric gastroesophageal reflux — "red flag" symptoms and signs suggesting disorders other than GERD (0 to 18 years of age): General features such as weight loss, lethargy, fever, excessive irritability/pain, and dysuria are "suggesting a variety of conditions, including systemic infections", and dysuria "may suggest urinary tract infection, especially in infants and young children". Onset of regurgitation/vomiting " > 6 months or increasing/persisting > 12–18 months of age" is described as "Late onset as well as symptoms increasing or persisting after infancy, based on natural course of the disease, may indicate a diagnosis other than GERD". Neurologic signs including bulging fontanel/rapidly increasing head circumference "may suggest raised intracranial pressure for example due to meningitis, brain tumor or hydrocephalus". Gastrointestinal red flags include persistent forceful vomiting "indicative of hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (infants up to 2 months old)", nocturnal vomiting that "may suggest increased intracranial pressure", bilious vomiting "Regarded as symptom of intestinal obstruction", hematemesis that "suggests a potentially serious bleed", rectal bleeding "indicative of multiple conditions", and abdominal distension "Indicative of obstruction, dysmotility, or anatomic abnormalities".

### Neonatal isolated rectal bleeding and the risk of hypersensitivity syndromes [^117ELiCB]. Journal of Perinatology (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

When rectal bleeding occurs in an otherwise asymptomatic child, it can be classified as isolated rectal bleeding (IRB). Among the different etiologies suggested for IRB, one of the most common is a hypersensitivity reaction of the bowel mucosa to digested antigens. The objective of this study was to assess the long-term outcomes and the risk of developing hypersensitivity syndromes among infants following an IRB event.

Study Design

A historical prospective comparative study was carried out. The study compared 77 infants who were born at the Sheba Medical Center in Israel during the period 2002 to 2009 and who experienced a neonatal IRB event to 77 infants with the same gestational age, but without IRB. Data were obtained from hospital records and from phone interviews with the parents regarding hypersensitivity syndrome between the ages of 3 and 10 years.

Result

The IRB group was not at an increased risk of developing a hypersensitivity syndrome or gastrointestinal symptoms compared to the control group. Longer duration of breast-feeding was found to be related to a lower incidence of hypersensitivity symptoms.

Conclusion

An IRB event in the neonatal period does not increase the risk of developing hypersensitivity syndromes or food allergies during childhood.

### Case report: profound anemia in a 2-year-old boy associated with a leech in the oropharynx [^116xEtzt]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2024). Medium credibility.

CASE PRESENTATION

A 2-year, 10-month-old boy was brought by his mother to the Casualty Department at Kapsowar Mission Hospital (KMH) in Kapsowar, located in a remote area of northwest Kenya. The mother reported that the child had 2 days of tiredness and unilateral epistaxis, with the most recent epistaxis on the day of admission. There was one episode of hematemesis. The child had no decrease in oral intake or poor diet nor melena and/or bright-red rectal bleeding. There was no family history of bleeding diatheses, genetic bleeding disorders, or liver disease.

On admission, the child had a hemoglobin value of 3.4 g/dL. The white cell count was 20.6 × 10 9 /L, 76% neutrophils, 19% lymphocytes, 3% monocytes, 0% eosinophils, and 1% basophils. Malaria was not considered to be a likely cause as Kapsowar is not a malaria-endemic region and the elevation of the child's village was above the elevation range of Plasmodium falciparum –carrying mosquitoes. Nonetheless, a malaria parasite test was performed and was negative. Of the limited tests available in the hospital laboratory, including the malaria parasite test, complete blood count, and peripheral smear, none of the test results provided any clue as to what might be causing such profound anemia with leukocytosis.

On examination, the child was listless and pale but had appropriate physical development for his stated age. Aside from marked pallor of the conjunctivae and mucous membranes, the child had normal physical findings. However, one of the local physicians pointed out that although the nasopharynx of children is too small to contain a full-sized leech, a leech could be present deep in the oropharynx.

On deeper examination of the oropharynx, the tail of a leech was noticed, but it was too deep in the oropharynx to allow retrieval with forceps or hemostat. The child was taken to the operating theater, where the nurse anesthetist on duty examined the child with a laryngoscope, identified the leech, and removed the leech with McGill forceps (Figure 1).

### Risk factors of mild rectal bleeding in very low birth weight infants: a case control study [^117EAetU]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Methods

Study design

This was a single centre retrospective case–control study.

Population

All children with birth weight (BW) ≤ 1500 g or gestational age (GA) ≤ 32 weeks admitted to the tertiary neonatal intensive care unit of the University Hospital of the Croix Rousse in Lyon were eligible for the study.

The Cases were preterm infants who had MRB; that is to say, either isolated or with mild clinical (mild abdominal distention, elevated pre-gavage residuals or emesis) or radiological (intestinal dilatation, mild ileus) signs, different from NEC stage 2 which is characterized by specific radiological signs such as pneumatosis intestinalis. When a patient had multiple incidents of rectal bleeding, we included only the first episode. When a relapse took place more than 7 days after rectal bleeding, it was considered as a recurrence. Otherwise it was considered as related to the first event.

The British Journal of Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Familial adenomatous polyposis

Section I: lower gastrointestinal manifestations

LGI.1

It is now well-established, based on different guidelines, that children and adolescents predicted to develop FAP (patients with germline PV in the APC gene (for FAP) or patients with at least one FDR affected by classical FAP) should undergo surveillance (Table 14). Recent studies have not provided data on the true age distribution for the diagnosis of CRC. Older studies no longer reflect the current situation due to the impact of screening, adenoma removal, and prophylactic surgery. In a recent study by Kennedy et al. the median age of first adenoma detection was reported as 13.4 years. They observed HGD in five patients (ages 13, 16, 17 and two at 20 years old) and invasive cancer in five patients (one at 19 years, two at 18 years and two at 17 years of age). Munk et al. reported a case of invasive cancer in an 8-year-old patient, but no information was provided regarding symptoms. An overview of different European polyposis registries showed very low numbers of CRC cases in younger patients (0–10 years: none, 11–15 years: 2 patients, 16–20 years: 15 patients). The updated version of the guidelines still suggests starting the screening programme at the age of 12 in asymptomatic patients. Potential alarm symptoms, such as changes in bowel movements, rectal bleeding/anaemia, looser stool and mucous discharge, should indicate a colonoscopy in FAP patients, as these might be indicators of more severe polyposis. Rectal bleeding, in particular, is a predictive factor for dysplasia. In accordance with the previous guidelineand in agreement with other international guidelines, a colonoscopy should be performed in all symptomatic FAP patients, regardless of age.

### The clinical utility and safety of rectal suction biopsy in children, a single center report [^112hBDtH]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

5 CONCLUSION

The bleeding rate and proportion of inconclusive biopsies observed at our institution over the past 10 years are slightly higher than those reported in previous studies. While further multicenter studies are needed to confirm and expand on these findings, these results suggest proper training and continuous quality monitoring are crucial at centers performing RSBs, given that adverse events and inadequate specimen collection occur at nonnegligible rates.

### The clinical utility and safety of rectal suction biopsy in children, a single center report [^115M8AV3]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

4 DISCUSSION

RSB is a valuable diagnostic tool utilized by gastroenterologists and surgeons to evaluate HD. To date, we have conducted the largest review of RSB procedures at a single institution. Historically, inadequate sample collection has been the most frequent challenge associated with RSBs, a finding consistent with the cohort of patients. Specimen adequacy rate (73%–100%) has varied significantly in the literature. Friemacher et al.performed a systematic review regarding RSB and they reported 89.9% of adequate tissue samples in suction biopsies for the diagnosis of HD from 14,053 samples. In this review, 99.7% (413 procedures) successfully obtained a specimen, with 82.6% (342/414) of cases yielding at least one conclusive biopsy. In 2023, Vervloet et al.reported that nonsurgical biopsies were more prone to yield more inconclusive results, often due to biopsy technique and pathologist evaluation. This study concluded most indeterminate results were due to the presence of squamous or transitional mucosa, suggesting rectal biopsies were likely taken too distally.

The minimally invasive nature of RSB allows for few potential adverse events; however, major morbidity from RSB occurs in up to 2% of patients. Regardless of the technique used for biopsy, significant bleeding, and/or perforation from the site are rare but serious adverse events that have been historically identified. Interestingly, while significant bleeding was not reported with the Rbi2 device until Corbett et al.bleeding requiring transfusion remains the most common adverse event of RSB, with an occurrence rate of 0.53%. Corbett documented three cases (1.6%) of persistent rectal bleeding following RSB with the Rbi2 gun. This investigation identified 18 bleeding events (4.3%), most of which were classified as mild to moderate, with one severe case. The severe case involved an infant presenting with rectal bleeding and a hemoglobin of 6.1, requiring a blood transfusion, ICU admission for monitoring, and surgical oversewing of two biopsy sites identified on anoscopy. Going forward, an important consideration to help minimize bleeding complications is to document the biopsy location and characterize the biopsy sample.

### A case of rectal ulcers during aspirin therapy in acute Kawasaki disease [^112acgD8]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute febrile multisystem vasculitis and has been recognized to be one of the most common causes of acquired heart disease in children. Although gastrointestinal symptoms including vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are not uncommon in KD patients, KD with lower gastrointestinal bleeding is quite rare. Here, we describe a 3-year-old boy with typical KD who had lower gastrointestinal bleeding caused by rectal ulcers on the third day of aspirin therapy.

### Pediatric inflammatory bowel disease [^115Zohc4]. Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are chronic, immune-mediated disorders that include Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. A pediatric onset of disease occurs in about 10% of all cases. Clinical presentation of IBD with rectal bleeding or perianal disease warrants direct referral for endoscopic evaluation. In the absence of red-flag symptoms, a combination of patient history and blood and fecal biomarkers can help to distinguish suspected IBD from other causes of abdominal pain or diarrhea. The therapeutic management of pediatric IBD has evolved by taking into account predictors of poor outcome, which justifies the upfront use of anti-tumor necrosis factor therapy for patients at high risk for complicated disease. In treating patients with IBD, biochemical or endoscopic remission, rather than clinical remission, is the therapeutic goal because intestinal inflammation often persists despite resolution of abdominal symptoms. Pediatric IBD comes with unique additional challenges, such as growth impairment, pubertal delay, the psychology of adolescence, and development of body image. Even after remission has been achieved, many patients with IBD continue to experience nonspecific symptoms like abdominal pain and fatigue. Transfer to adult care is a well-recognized risk for disease relapse, which highlights patient vulnerability and the need for a transition program that is continued by the adult-oriented IBD team. The general pediatrician is an invaluable link in integrating these challenges in the clinical care of patients with IBD and optimizing their outcomes. This state-of-the-art review aims to provide general pediatricians with an update on pediatric IBD to facilitate interactions with pediatric gastrointestinal specialists.

### Bleeding after suction rectal biopsy with rbi2: identification of the root cause through a multi-staged approach [^117YHPoi]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Suction rectal biopsy (SRB) is a key diagnostic tool in Hirschsprung's disease. The original Noblett device has been superseded by modern alternatives including the Rbi2 rectal biopsy gun. We describe a comparison of biopsy results from the Noblett device and the Rbi2 gun and an investigation into significant post-biopsy bleeding episodes with the latter.

Methods

A retrospective review of SRB episodes between 2006 and 2014 was undertaken to audit biopsy success rates. Significant post-procedure bleeding after SRB with the Rbi2 gun prompted further investigations.

Results

Biopsies taken with the Noblett gun were more likely to be inadequate (Noblett 82/197 (40%) vs Rbi2 77/438 (18%)). After biopsy with the Rbi2 gun, 2 infants suffered from significant bleeding requiring resuscitation, blood product support and multiple theater episodes. As there were no reported cases of bleeding with the Rbi2 gun, a report was made to the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency who identified incorrect biopsy technique as a potential contributing factor. A questionnaire of trainees and consultants found unexpected individual variation in SRB technique, with some users applying excessive suction.

Conclusions

Significant bleeding occurred after SRB with the Rbi2 gun, excessive suction was thought to be the cause.

### Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome in children: a report of 140 cases [^1144YjvF]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome (SRUS) is said to be rare in children (largest series so far; 55 in children, 116 in adults). We analyzed our experience to look at its clinical presentations, endoscopic appearance, and treatment outcome in a large cohort of children.

Methods

Clinical and endoscopic data were collected between 2000 and 2018. Children (18 years or younger) diagnosed to have SRUS on colonoscopy and confirmed by histopathology were included. All children with SRUS were treated with behavioral modification, bulk laxative. Most with ulcer received steroid enema and some sulfasalazine or sucralfate enema.

Results

The median age of 140 children was 12 (interquartile range [IQR]: 10–14) years, 79% were boys. The median symptom duration was 21 (IQR: 9–36) months. Rectal bleeding was the presenting feature in 131 (93.6%); constipation in 38 (27%); and small, frequent stools in 79 (56%). Most children had features of dyssynergic defecation such as prolonged sitting in the toilet (131, 93.6%), excessive straining (138, 98.6%), a feeling of incomplete evacuation (130, 92.8%), and rectal digitation (71, 50.7%). Rectal prolapse was noted in 24 (17%) cases. Colonoscopy documented rectal ulcer in 101 (72%) [Single: 84]. Over a median follow-up of 6 (IQR: 4–18) months, 27 patients were lost to follow-up and of the remaining 113 cases, 71 (62.8%) showed clinical improvement (healing of ulcer documented in 36/82, 44%).

Conclusions

The majority of cases of SRUS presented in second decade with rectal bleeding and features of dyssynergic defecation. Ulcer was noted in three fourths of cases. The outcome of medical treatment with behavioral modification and local therapy was modest.

### Jejunal intussusception: a cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding? [^112HhBf3]. BMJ Case Reports (2012). Medium credibility.

Intussusception is an important cause of abdominal pain in the paediatric population and is the most common abdominal emergency in early childhood. Intussusception in adults is, however, rare and can lead to diagnostic challenges for admitting physicians/surgeons. We present a case of a 76-year-old lady with history of a recent myocardial infarction and vasculitis presenting with melaena and bleeding per rectum, with suspicion of haematochezia. She complained of abdominal pain but was not clinically obstructed. Gastroscopy performed was negative. Colonoscopy was attempted; however, it was inconclusive because of active bleeding. A CT angiogram of the abdomen was performed, which showed a jejunal intussusception. There was no evidence of vasculitis or small bowel obstruction. She was not considered fit for surgery and was managed conservatively.

### Characteristics of neonates with isolated rectal bleeding [^1148FufJ]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the characteristics of full term and preterm neonates with isolated rectal bleeding (IRB), and to follow the outcome of these low risk patients.

Design

A retrospective case-control study consisting of 147 cases (83 full term and near term infants and 64 preterm infants) and 147 controls in a single institution.

Results

A feeding regimen that did not include breast milk was the only variable found to predict IRB. In full term and near term babies (gestational age ≥ 35 weeks), 52.6% of the study group were breast fed compared with 83.1% of the controls (p < 0.0001). In preterm babies (gestational age ≤ 34 weeks), 45.9% of the study group were breast fed compared with 74.2% of the controls (p = 0.0014). No obvious systemic infection cause was detected. None of the patients showed clinical or radiological deterioration in the days after diagnosis of IRB.

Conclusions

The outcome of a group of low risk neonates with IRB was excellent. It is questionable whether antibiotic treatment is required and feeding needs to be stopped. Breast feeding, even if only partial, should be encouraged.

### Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome in children [^112YDorv]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2008). Low credibility.

SRUS is a rare condition in children, which usually presents with a symptom complex of rectal bleeding, passage of mucus and straining on defecation, tenesmus, perineal and abdominal pain, sensation of incomplete defecation, constipation and rectal prolapse. The underlying etiology of SRUS is not fully understood but it is likely to be secondary to ischemic changes in the rectum associated with paradoxical contraction of pelvic floor and external anal sphincter muscles and rectal prolapse. Conservative measures like high intake of fluids and fibers, laxatives, biofeedback and behavior modification therapy may be beneficial for treatment of constipation. Excision of rectal ulcer and surgery of overt rectal prolapse, however, may be required in refractory cases not responding to conservative treatments. A therapeutic role for botulinum toxin injection into the external anal sphincter for treatment of SRUS associated with constipation and paradoxical contraction of pelvic floor and external anal sphincter muscles in children, may exist.

### Solitary rectal ulcer transformation to cap polyposis in a 15-year-old child [^112yyVhf]. BMC Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Cap polyposis (CP) is a benign, non-malignant inflammatory disease that affects the rectum. It usually occurs during the 5th decade of life, but children could also be affected. Its specific pathology is unknown. Due to the clinical, endoscopic, and histologic similarities with other disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease, a thorough histologic evaluation is critical to avoid unnecessary interventions. This study presents a 15-year-old child with a previously reported case of solitary rectal ulcer (SRU) that developed into CP determined by colonoscopy and histologic findings.

Case presentation

A 15-year-old boy who was previously diagnosed with SRU presented to our office with rectal bleeding, mucoid discharge, and abdominal pain. Additional colonoscopy evaluation revealed multiple polyposes varying in size and shape limited to the rectum. Histologic examination revealed a characteristic cap of granulation tissue covering tortuous nondysplastic crypts in the inflamed stroma, indicating that SRU had transformed into CP. Based on the assessments, we planned to perform endoscopic mucosal resection of the lesions in multiple sessions.

Conclusions

Despite the rarity of CP, the transformation from SRU may be one of its etiologies. Thus, thorough serial histologic evaluation is critical in children with rectal bleeding to avoid unnecessary or harmful interventions.

### Dieulafoy lesion in a one-year-old child [^112QVnp3]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2004). Low credibility.

The Dieulafoy lesion is a rare cause of severe upper gastrointestinal bleeding associated with a significant mortality. Rebleeding from undiscovered lesions is frequent and often fatal. The outcome depends on a high degree of suspicion for the condition. In any age group, the entity may be underdiagnosed rather than truly rare. It is particularly uncommon in infants. The authors report the case of the youngest patient so far to suffer from a Dieulafoy lesion.

### A rare and often unrecognized cause of hematochezia and tenesmus in childhood: solitary rectal ulcer syndrome [^111KgNTn]. Pediatrics (2002). Low credibility.

Solitary rectal ulcer syndrome (SRUS) is an unusual disorder of childhood, which usually presents with rectal bleeding, mucous discharge, prolonged straining, tenesmus, and localized pain in the perineal area. After the first description by Cruveilhier, Madigan and Morson further detailed the clinical and pathologic features of SRUS in 1969. The pathogenesis of the syndrome is not well-understood. The postulated mechanism responsible for rectal prolapse in most cases seems to be excessive straining efforts during which high intra-abdominal pressure forces the anterior rectal mucosa firmly into the contracting puborectalis muscle. The anterior rectal mucosa is frequently forced into the anal canal and as a consequence becomes strangulated, causing congestion, edema, and ulceration. Histologically, the presence of fibromuscular obliteration of the lamina propria with disorientation of muscle fibers is characteristic, which could be secondary to chronic mechanical and ischemic trauma and inflammation by hard stools, and intussusception of the rectal mucosa. Although the syndrome is well-recognized in adults, the pediatric experience with this condition is limited and often remains unrecognized or misdiagnosed. A misdiagnosis has been reported in one fourth of adult cases, and the correct diagnosis usually delayed approximately 5 to 7 years. There are few pediatric case reports in English literature. Here, we describe 2 children with SRUS, aged 11 and 14 years, whose SRUS was diagnosed 2 and 6 years, respectively, after the onset of the first signs and symptoms.

### Minimal access surgical management of large juvenile polyps in children [^112WqESq]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Juvenile polyps have a reported incidence of up to 2% in individuals younger than of 18 years. Most polyps are small, occur in the distal colon and rectum, and present with bleeding or prolapse. Giant juvenile polyps have been rarely reported.

Case Reports

We encountered 2 unique presentations of very large juvenile polyps in children. A 9-year-old boy presented with recurrent rectal bleeding and anemia because of a single large polyp at the hepatic flexure. A 14-year-old boy presented with abdominal pain secondary to 2 large polyps in the cecum. The polyps were seen on colonoscopy as pedunculated masses larger than 5 cm and were not subjected to biopsy. Both patients underwent laparoscopic colon mobilizations with extracorporeal segmental resection in the first patient and colotomy and polypectomy in the second. Both patients had short hospital stays and excellent outcomes.

Conclusions

Giant juvenile polyps are rare in children and may not be amenable to colonoscopic removal. They can be resected effectively with minimal access surgical techniques.

An 8-year-old boy presented with first episode of rectal bleeding. Initial hemoglobin was 9 g/dL. A Meckel scan showed a hyperemic focus in the lower pelvis. Colonoscopy identified a juvenile polyp with dysplasia in the rectosigmoid region. It is important to carefully evaluate the dynamic flow images in the Meckel scan because pathology other than a Meckel diverticulum may be identified.

### Anorectal emergencies: WSES-AAST guidelines [^111ndzB7]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

No recommendation can be made regarding the role of biochemical investigations in patients with suspected thrombosed or strangulated hemorrhoids, based on the available literature.

In patients with suspected bleeding hemorrhoids, we suggest to collect a focused medical history and to perform a complete physical examination, including a digital rectal examination, to rule out other causes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C).

In patients with suspected bleeding hemorrhoids, we suggest to check vital signs, to determine hemoglobin and hematocrit, and to assess coagulation to evaluate the severity of the bleeding (weak recommendation based on low-quality evidence, 2C). In case of severe bleeding, we suggest blood typing and cross-matching (weak recommendation based on very low-quality evidence, 2D).

### Juvenile polyp presenting with rectal bleeding in a 2-year-old girl [^112bLtFV]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2011). Low credibility.

Juvenile polyps (JP) are rare but important causes of acute gastrointestinal symptoms in children.

Juvenile polyps may present with hematochezia, prolapse of the polyp from the anus, abdominal pain due to intussusception or may even be asymptomatic. All such polyps should be removed by colonoscopy or transanal resection.

A 2-year-old girl was referred to our department due to lower gastrointestinal bleeding. Patient family history was negative. Pediatric diagnostic workout was negative and endoscopy was decided. Colonoscopy revealed a 2-cm penduculated polyp at the rectum while the rest of the large bowel and the terminal ileum were normal. Endoscopic polypectomy was performed at the operation room under general anesthesia (E.V.T.). The child recovered completely and was discharged with no recurrent episode of rectal bleeding at follow up. Histology of the resected polyp was compatible with juvenile polyp with no signs of dysplasia. In detail, the polyp had an epithelial and a connective tissue element. Smooth muscle fibers were found in the stroma. The epithelial lining of the tubules consisted of cells that showed little sign of increased nuclear activity such as hyperchromatism and mitosis, although there was some diminution in the number of goblet cells. The tubules were dilated by retained mucus leading to flattening of the epithelial lining. The epithelial tubules were widely separated by a fine areolar network of reticulin fibres and connective tissue cells containing a sprinkling of lymphocytes and plasma cells.

Rectal polyps in children are juvenile in their majority and are mostly located at the rectum. In a large review series of 563 children aged from 2 months to 17 years the highest incidence of polyps was between ages 2 and 10 years (85.1%). Rectal bleeding was the presenting symptom in 78.5% cases. The polyps were solitary in 94% of cases. The majority of polyps (86.3%) were juvenile and 86.7% located in the rectosigmoid area. Three percent of cases had a positive family history. One case of Turcot syndrome was also identified. Polyps must be removed even when asymptomatic because of their probable neoplastic potential.

Though most JP are located in the left colon, a complete colonoscopy should be the initial procedure because 37% revealed proximal polyps, 32% of polyps were located proximal to splenic flexure, persistence of symptoms from missed proximal polyp(s) necessitates a repeat study with attendant risks, and there is a possibility of malignant transformation in an unidentified JP.

### Polyposis syndromes in children and adolescents: a case series data analysis [^115d5DpD]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Polyposis syndromes in children are distinct entities clinically and pathologically. These syndromes have multiple genetic characteristics, with development of polyps at various sites of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and are associated with an increased risk of colon cancer. They are relatively rare, and have mostly been characterized in the adult population, whereas little epidemiologic data have been reported in children.

Aims

The aim of this study was to summarize the pediatric experience collected over a period of 11 years on polyposis syndromes in three major Israeli tertiary centers.

Patients and Methods

Medical records of children below 18 years old and their families, diagnosed with polyposis syndromes between 1999 and 2010, were reviewed. The data included disease presentation, genetic profile, surveillance, and treatment.

Results

Fifty patients with polyposis syndromes were identified. The most frequent syndrome was familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) in 33 children (66%), of whom 25 children (75.7%) had a known mutation. The mean age at presentation was 10.6 ± 3.9 years (range 4–17 years). Most children were examined because of a family history of a polyposis syndrome (42 children, 84%). Among symptomatic children (32 children), the most frequent complaint was rectal bleeding (42%), followed by abdominal pain (22%), intussusception (10%), and diarrhea (4%). The youngest symptomatic patient was 4 years old at presentation, with rectal bleeding. All patients underwent multiple colonoscopies and upper GI endoscopies according to specific guidelines. Thirteen children underwent colonic surgery (39%); nine children had FAP. Adenocarcinoma of the colon was diagnosed in a 12.5-year-old child.

Conclusion

In this cohort study, FAP was the most common type of polyposis syndrome diagnosed in this pediatric population. Colon cancer was present at the onset of symptoms in a 12.5-year-old patient with FAP. We therefore recommend strict adherence to the hereditary GI cancer guidelines to prevent morbidity and mortality in FAP and other inherited polyposis syndromes.

Ulcerative colitis (UC) in children — diagnosis and classification indicates that "The diagnosis of classic UC is established by colonoscopy in a patient with typical clinical symptoms, in whom enteric infections have been excluded", and that "Rectal bleeding occurs in 83% to 95% of patients with UC (as opposed to 40% of patients with CD)". It further notes "It is unusual for diarrhea to be present without blood in UC", "In classic UC there is diffuse continuous inflammation extending from the rectum proximally", and that other symptoms "may include weight loss, fatigue, skin manifestations (pyoderma gangrenosum, erythema nodosum), but none of these distinguish UC from CD".

### Abdominal surgical emergencies in infants and young children [^1125QbGd]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

Surgical emergencies can be missed easily in children, who are not always able to volunteer relevant information. Awareness of the entities discussed in this review might help the EP uncover subtle clues to early diagnoses that might not be initially apparent. Ill-appearing children who have abdominal pain and vomiting should be considered to have ischemic or necrotic bowel until proven otherwise. Possible diagnoses include volvulus, intussusception, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Bilious vomiting, especially in a young infant, should be considered to be an indication of a high bowel obstruction such as midgut volvulus, which warrants immediate surgical consultation. Significant rectal bleeding with abdominal pain can result from intussusception, volvulus, or an inflamed Meckel's diverticulum. Rectal bleeding with unstable vital signs can result from an upper GI bleed (eg, peptic ulcer disease). Painless rectal bleeding can result from a Meckel's diverticulum, polyps, arteriovenous malformation, or a tumor. Examination of the genitalia is imperative, especially in boys, to exclude the possibility of an incarcerated hernia or testicular torsion.

### Are we overdoing pediatric lower gastrointestinal endoscopy? [^113ukuSa]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Lower gastrointestinal endoscopy (LGIE)/colonoscopy is frequently performed for rectal bleeding, recurrent abdominal pain, and the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Although these are common indications, the causes of isolated rectal bleeding and recurrent abdominal pain in the otherwise well child have not been described.

Methods

A retrospective analysis of patients who had had an LGIE/colonoscopy from January 2001 to December 2010 was performed. The following data were collected: demographic data, indication, distance reached, macroscopic findings, microscopic findings, diagnosis, additional procedures, and complications.

Results

There were a total of 999 colonoscopies. The colonoscopy was normal in 390 of 999 (39%). The commonest indication for colonoscopy was a diagnosis of suspected IBD, 449 of 999 (45%). IBD was confirmed in 282 of 449 (63%), but colonoscopy was normal in 143 of 449 (32%) of suspected IBD. Colonoscopy was performed for rectal bleeding in 197 of 999 (20%) of whom 141 of 197 (72%) were normal. There were 46 (5%) colonoscopies performed for recurrent abdominal pain, which were all normal. Our completion rate to the cecum and beyond was 521 of 999 (52%). Our perforation rate during the 10 years was 0.2%.

Conclusions

Colonoscopy is a safe procedure in pediatrics; however, 39% of colonoscopies in this series were normal. Many of these could have been avoided by eliminating colonoscopy in patients with recurrent abdominal pain in the absence of other clinical features, conservative management with laxatives for those with fresh blood per rectum typical of anal fissures, and fecal calprotectin screening before endoscopy in patients with suspected IBD.

### Hematochezia in a patient with liver cirrhosis [^1146GiCM]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

Haematochezia requiring acute management is an uncommon problem in patients with portal hypertension (0.5–3.6%) and so treatment paradigms are not well established. Initial medical management following the same principles as that for esophagogastric gastric is generally recommended on both theoretical and empiric grounds and therefore we firstly tried pharmacologically reduction of the patient's portal pressure by instituting both a β-blocker and a synthetic analogue of vasopressin while also addressing his abnormal coagulation. Failure of the bleeding to lessen however mandated an attempt at more definitive intervention. Given that this episode represented the patients first episode of decompensation on a background of Child's B liver disease, we were reluctant to proceed directly to formal mechanical portal vein decompression (by means of portosystemic shunt created either by a Transjugular Intrahepatic approach [i.e. TIPS] or open operation) and therefore considered the available endoscopic treatments proposed in the literature.

Endoscopic band ligation has previously been shown by others to be effective in exactly this scenario albeit in small case seriesas indeed has endoscopic sclerotherapy. Some authors however have expressed concern that the latter procedure risks exacerbation of bleeding when the varices demonstrate red colour signs (as may be seen to be present in image one). While the long-term efficacy of either method is uncertain, such endoscopic intervention has been reported to provide an effective means of short-term relief of rectal bleeding without recourse to formal portal vein decompression in patients with cirrhosis whose main clinical issue is hematochezia. Our own experience encourages us to continue to utilise this therapeutic means in such circumstances.

### Meckel's masquerade: penetrating the disguise [^111RwNoF]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Children with abdominal pain are frequently seen in emergency departments. Physicians and parents worry about appendicitis; physicians are also concerned about intussusception and bowel obstruction in patients with previous surgical procedures. Sometimes the patient is ill, and the diagnosis is elusive. In a 6-month period at our pediatric emergency department with an annual census of 57,400 patients, we cared for 4 patients who presented with abdominal pain due to complications of Meckel's diverticulum. None presented with painless rectal bleeding, the complication of which physicians are most aware. We are reporting these patients to raise awareness of Meckel's diverticulum as a cause of acute abdomen in children. Meckel's diverticulum may masquerade as appendicitis, an abdominal mass, intussusception, or a complication of severe constipation.

### Recurrent abdominal pain in children: is colonoscopy indicated? [^116N31q1]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) in children is common, with most functional in origin. Colonoscopy has sometimes been performed to exclude pathology but its role is unclear. Our aim therefore was to assess the diagnostic yield and role of colonoscopy in these children. Retrospective review of consecutive colonoscopies in a tertiary pediatric hospital between November 2011 and October 2015 was undertaken. Only those with RAP as an indication for procedure were included. Chart review of patients with pain was undertaken to ensure they fulfilled Rome IV criteria. Patient demographics, indication for procedure, and adjunct preprocedure tests were noted. Statistical analyses were performed with SPSS software. A total of 652 colonoscopies were performed, of which 68 (10%) had abdominal pain as one of the indications, and was the sole indication in 15 (2%) patients. All 68 patients had preprocedure serum inflammatory markers measured and 53% (36/68) had stool calprotectin. Positive histology was found in 10% (7/68) including Crohn disease (n = 3), polyps (n = 2), and microscopic colitis (n = 2). The remaining 61 patients had normal colonoscopy and ileocolonic biopsies. Of the 36 patients 5 had raised fecal calprotectin, and all had abnormal histology. Serum inflammatory markers were raised in 4 patients and all also had abnormal calprotectin. No patient with isolated abdominal pain had positive histology. Rectal bleeding was the only associated indication to predict abnormal histology (P = 0.019). Colonoscopy is likely not warranted in children with RAP without bleeding, weight loss, or altered bowel habit. Fecal calprotectin is useful in helping predict positive findings.

Isolated rectal ulcers and malignant tumours can potentially cause rectal ulcer bleeding secondary to duodenal ulcer bleeding. However, patients with isolated rectal ulcer syndrome exhibit symptoms beyond mere ulceration, including aberrant defecation patterns, urgency, tenesmus, mucous stools, and unexplained anal pain. Furthermore, these symptoms typically correlate with complications, such as rectal prolapse and intussusception. This contrasts with the clinical history obtained through patient inquiry, observed clinical symptomatology, and physical examination outcomes. Discriminating between rectal ulcers, polyps, and cancer frequently requires careful evaluation. However, the ulcers presented by this patient did not manifest features similar to the aforementioned pathologies. Notably, this patient had undergone a colonoscopy examination a year before owing to minimal rectal bleeding, and was diagnosed with internal haemorrhoids that were subsequently ameliorated through appropriate intervention. While acknowledging the pivotal role of pathological evidence, the gravity of the patient's prevailing medical condition, coupled with the ample clinical dataset at hand, informed our decision to forgo pursuing a biopsy.

### Differential diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease: imitations and complications [^112qkNKf]. The Lancet: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2018). Medium credibility.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is characterised by episodes of relapse and periods of remission. However, the clinical features, such as abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and rectal bleeding, are not specific. Therefore, the differential diagnosis can include a broad spectrum of inflammatory or infectious diseases that mimic IBD, as well as others that might complicate existing IBD. In this Review, we provide an overview of ileocolitis of diverse causes that are relevant in the differential diagnosis of IBD. We highlight the importance of accurate patient profiling and give a practical approach to identifying factors that should trigger the search for a specific cause of intestinal inflammation. Mimics of IBD include not only infectious causes of colitis-and particular attention is required for patients from endemic areas of tuberculosis-but also vascular diseases, diversion colitis, diverticula or radiation-related injuries, drug-induced inflammation, and monogenic diseases in very-early-onset refractory disease. A superinfection with cytomegalovirus or Clostridium difficile can aggravate intestinal inflammation in IBD, especially in patients who are immunocompromised. Special consideration should be made to the differential diagnosis of perianal disease.

### Isotretinoin-induced inflammatory bowel disease in an adolescent [^1169foQc]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) associated with use of isotretinoin.

Case Summary

17-year-old boy presented with new-onset rectal bleeding after completion of a five-month course of isotretinoin. A diagnosis of ulcerative colitis was made. His condition worsened despite therapy with 5-aminosalicylic acid, steroid retention enema, iron supplement, and prednisone. Five months after the onset of rectal bleeding, he had lost 11.4 kgand developed bilateral pitting edema of the hips and profound anemia. A subtotal colectomy and ileostomy was performed.

Discussion

Rectal bleeding has been reported to occur during or up to several years after treatment with isotretinoin. The mechanism by which isotretinoin may induce IBD is unknown. Proposed mechanisms include inhibition of epithelial cell growth resulting in ulceration and inflammation of the gut mucosa, inhibition of glycoprotein synthesis affecting the integrity of the mucosal wall, and stimulation of kiler T cells, leading to epithelial cell injury and a resultant inflammatory response.

Conclusion

This case of probable isotretinoin-induced IBD suggests that patients with suspected IBD should be asked about current or past use of isotretinoin to improve documentation of this serious adverse event.

### Approach to the bleeding child [^1142ZTSs]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2002). Low credibility.

Because bruising and bleeding are normal events of childhood, the pediatrician must be able to determine whether a child's symptoms are normal or perhaps indicative of a defective hemostasis. A thorough medical history and physical examination should enable the clinician to choose those patients warranting further evaluation. Rather than referral to a hematologist at that point in time, pediatricians should be quite capable of performing the initial laboratory evaluation and making the correct diagnosis in a majority of cases.

### Approach to the patient with bleeding [^114iAydj]. Hematology/Oncology Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Approach to the patient with bleeding begins with a thorough bleeding, medical, and family history to determine the nature of bleeding and severity of bleeding symptoms. Use of a Bleeding Assessment Tool allows the clinician to obtain a comprehensive bleeding history and ultimately determine the individual bleeding score that reflects bleeding severity and is classifiable as either normal or abnormal. In the absence of significant findings within patient history or presenting symptoms clearly pointing to a specific bleeding pathology, an approach to laboratory investigation is presented that proceeds through first-line, second-line, and third-line testing.

### Postoperative pneumatosis intestinalis in infants does not automatically preclude enteral feeding [^114vD6Tu]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2001). Low credibility.

Background

A degree of feed intolerance after neonatal abdominal surgery is common but in an otherwise well baby enteral feeding usually is continued at the highest tolerated level. However, the presence of rectal bleeding, pneumatosis intestinalis, or portal vein gas seen on plain abdominal x-rays suggest the possibility of postoperative necrotising enterocolitis. When this happens feedings usually are stopped for 7 to 10 days, and intravenous antibiotics and total parental nutrition are commenced.

Methods

The authors report 12 episodes of rectal bleeding and 11 episodes of pneumatosis intestinalis in 3 infants who previously had undergone neonatal abdominal surgery for intestinal malformations. In 7 of these episodes, feedings were neither stopped nor were antibiotics given. At the time of these 7 episodes, the infants were more than 3 kg in weight, had no significant cardiac or respiratory pathology, were all clinically stable, had no evidence of peritonitis, had no thrombocytopenia, and were greater than 37 weeks postconception.

Results

The 3 infants were monitored closely. There were no early or late problems observed attributable to this management.

Conclusion

Carefully selected clinically stable patients that have postoperative pneumatosis intestinalis or exhibit rectal bleeding may be successfully managed by reduced enteral feedings with no antibiotics. J Pediatr Surg 36:1820–1823.

### Successful treatment of Henoch-Schönlein purpura-associated hematochezia in a child with hemophilia A: a case report [^1149HVUW]. BMC Pediatrics (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The challenges in the hemophilic children are different from those in adults. Early and long-term prophylaxis in children with hemophilia is the most effective method of forestalling bleeding and either preventing or reducing joint damage, and increasing the patients' quality of life and life expectancy. Hemophilia A is a rare inherited bleeding disorder characterized by deficiency of coagulation FVIII. Such patients, if not optimally treated, encounter recurrent bleeding episodes causing cumulative damage and, commonly, arthropathy. Coagulation FVIII, as a coagulation replacement factor, has been used to treat and prevent hemophilia A for decades. It can prevent hemophilia A patients from bleeding symptoms, joint dysfunction and abnormal, massive postoperative bleeding caused by the disease. FVIII is an important coagulation factor in the endogenous coagulation pathway. As a cofactor of coagulation factor IXa, FVIII participates in the activation of coagulation factor X and forms an endogenous coagulation pathway. Gastrointestinal bleeding is one of the serious complications of hemophilia. The most common cause of abdominal bleeding in hemophilia is gastrointestinal mucosal bleeding. Diagnostic imaging is necessary to differentiate between various causes of abdominal bleeding. At this time, prophylactic dosing is mostly based on the Swedish regimen of 25 IU/kg thrice weekly or every other day in pediatric patients.

HSP is a systemic vasculitis involving small blood vessels, most notably the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and glomeruli, accompanied by arthralgia or arthritis. While the exact cause of HSP remains unknown, several studies have reported infections and imbalance of immune and genetic factors as causes of HSP. HSP can lead to severe complications, such as intussusception, gastrointestinal bleeding, or end-stage renal disease, although it is considered a self-limiting disease. Treatment of HSP includes controlling the acute symptoms and influencing factors of prognosis, such as acute joint pain, abdominal pain and renal damage.

Symptomatic or occult gastrointestinal bleeding, such as rectal bleeding, melena, and hematemesis, is observed in 50% of children with HSP. Glucocorticoids can quickly relieve gastrointestinal symptoms and shorten the duration of abdominal pain. Corticosteroids, given early in the course of illness, seem to produce consistent benefits for gastrointestinal bleeding, in children suffering from HSP. Remarkably, our patient also had congenital malrotation of the intestine, which could increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding.

Initial management — initial triage/evaluation emphasizes comprehensive bedside assessment: "A thorough history and physical examination is needed to determine potential sources of bleeding and help identify patients at risk of severe bleeding and adverse outcomes such as rebleeding and mortality". History should cover "cardiovascular, oncologic, or renal comorbidities; GI surgeries; and associated symptoms such as abdominal pain, alteration in bowel habits, or unintentional weight loss". Examination should include "careful attention to vital signs and assessment for signs of hypovolemia", and "Careful rectal examination can help determine whether a bleeding source may be emanating from the anorectal region or indicate the presence of melena, which may increase the likelihood of an UGIB". Medication review should assess "NSAIDs, antiplatelets, and anticoagulants", and "findings such as a preceding history of decompensated liver disease or prior peptic ulcer disease… or visible stigmata of advanced liver disease may indicate the possibility of an upper GI source of bleeding in a patient with severe hematochezia".

Clinical Presentation

A middle-aged man was admitted for episodes of fresh per-rectal bleeding, which were not associated with defecation. He was recently investigated for macrocytic anaemia in the outpatient haematology clinic. Examination of the perineum revealed grade 1 internal haemorrhoids with no signs of bleeding. Initial laboratory tests revealed macrocytic anaemia (haemoglobin 10.5g/dL, normal 12.9–17.0 g/dL; mean corpuscular haemoglobin 95.3fL, normal 80.0–95.0 fL). Peripheral blood film showing blasts, dysplastic neutrophils, nucleated red blood cells and hypogranular platelets. The patient underwent a sigmoidoscopy and rubber band ligation of the internal haemorrhoids after persistent fresh per-rectal bleeding. The bleeding persisted with the development of hypotension and a significant drop of haemoglobin to 4.8g/dL requiring blood transfusions and intensive care monitoring. Repeated endoscopy, including intubation of the terminal ileum, revealed uncomplicated right-sided diverticulosis. CT mesenteric angiography performed during an episode of significant bleeding revealed extravasation of contrast in the ileum, but mesenteric angiography was unsuccessful, possibly due to a temporary cessation of bleeding. Bleeding subsequently recurred and in light of the persistent bleeding with no clear source and with a total of 12units of packed cell transfused, exploratory laparotomy, on-table enteroscopy (figure 1) with small bowel resection was performed. Histopathological examination of the specimen was performed (figures 2–4).gutjnl;66/12/2068/GUTJNL2016313252F1F1GUTJNL2016313252F1Figure 1Multiple ileal lesions with stigmata of recent bleed.gutjnl;66/12/2068/GUTJNL2016313252F2F2GUTJNL2016313252F2Figure 2Area of ulceration associated with atypical mononuclear infiltrate.gutjnl;66/12/2068/GUTJNL2016313252F3F3GUTJNL2016313252F3Figure 3Atypical mononuclear infiltrate composed of cells with enlarged, irregular nuclei containing variably prominent nucleoli.gutjnl;66/12/2068/GUTJNL2016313252F4F4GUTJNL2016313252F4Figure 4Atypical cells displayed cytoplasmic expression of myeloperoxidase.

Question

What is the diagnosis?

### Diagnostic accuracy systematic review of rectal bleeding in combination with other symptoms, signs and tests in relation to colorectal cancer [^1113AmoM]. British Journal of Cancer (2010). Low credibility.

Limitations of the present study

The validity of the results of this systematic review is determined by an independent, unbiased selection process. However, any systematic review may be susceptible to publication bias. The quality of the review is dependent on the quality of the included cohort studies. Several dimensions that relate to the quality of the included studies are unclear or inadequately reported (Table 2, online). This finding is not intended as a criticism of the original studies, but is more a reflection on the considerable challenges of undertaking cohort studies in primary care settings that rely on complete identification and follow-up of all eligible incident cases of rectal bleeding. For instance, in one included study, general practitioners were asked to include a maximum of three to four patients. This prior selection may lead to a preferential selection of more severe cases and subsequent spectrum bias, producing spurious clinical associations and overestimation of likelihood ratios.

The other feature of included studies was the application of a variety of different reference standards. In the detection of colorectal cancer, the most sensitive and specific diagnostic test is colonoscopy, followed by a flexible sigmoidoscopy in combination with a barium enaema. In the included studies, a variety of reference standard tests were used with a possibility of work-up bias in some studies as lower-risk patents were subject to less rigorous reference standard tests (Table 2). Other methodological problems include incomplete or inadequate blinding of outcome assessment and incomplete reporting on losses to follow-up (Table 2).

We found significant between-study heterogeneity for a range of symptoms and signs (Table 3). This might be due to whether or not rectal bleeding was the principal reason for consultation and also the duration of rectal bleeding. Three included studies report rectal bleeding as the primary complaint in 15%, 51% and 100% of patients, respectively, and in terms of duration two studies excluded patients with rectal bleeding longer than six and twelve months, respectively.

For age categories, we calculated sensitivities, specificities and likelihood ratios. However, primary studies use different age cut-off points, which complicate the generation of reference categories. In our review, there is a slight overlap in some of the age categories, which may have affected the precision of pooled estimates. In terms of dark red blood, the reference category includes both patients with bright red blood and a colour in between. For a history of rectal bleeding the reference category consists of patients having a first episode of rectal bleeding.

### Mesalamine (Delzicol) [^116DAMNv]. FDA (2016). Low credibility.

The 4.8 g/day dose is not an approved dosage for the treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis.

Pediatrics The safety and effectiveness of mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets in pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age for treatment of mildly to moderately active ulcerative colitis are supported by evidence from adequate and well controlled studies of mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets in adults and a single study in pediatric patients.

A randomized, double-blind, 6-week study of 2 dose levels of mesalamine delayed-release 400 mg tablets (Study 3) was conducted in 82 pediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age with mildly or moderately active ulcerative colitis. All patients were divided by weight category (17 to less than 33 kg, 33 to less than 54 kg, and 54 to 90 kg) and randomly assigned to receive a low dose (1.2, 2.0, and 2.4 g/day for the respective weight category) or a high dose (2.0, 3.6, and 4.8 g/day). Doses were administered every 12 hours.

The proportion of patients who achieved success based on the Truncated Mayo Score (TM-Mayo) (based on the stool frequency and rectal bleeding subscores of the Mayo Score) and based on the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) (which included assessment of abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, stool consistency and frequency, presence of nocturnal bowel movement and level of activity) was measured after 6 weeks of treatment. Success based on TM-Mayo was defined as either partial response (improvement from baseline in stool frequency or rectal bleeding subscores with no worsening in the other) or complete response (both stool frequency and rectal bleeding subscores equal 0). Success based on PUCAI was defined as either partial response (PUCAI reduction of greater than or equal to 20 points from Baseline to Week 6 with Week 6 score greater than or equal to 10) or complete response (PUCAI less than 10 at Week 6).

### Primary non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of rectum presenting with rectal prolapse [^116o65UP]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Involvement of the rectum by primary or secondary malignant lymphoma is uncommon in adults. Primary lymphoma of the rectum in children is an extremely rare occurrence. We describe a 12-year-old boy with a localized rectal tumor that presented with rectal prolapse and bleeding, mimicking a juvenile polyp. He underwent transrectal local wide excision of the tumor, and the pathologic condition proved to be non-Hodgkin's lymphoma of diffuse large B-cell type. This case illustrates the importance of considering the possibility of a rectal malignancy manifesting as a rectal prolapse even in children and the surgical strategy used.

### Anovulatory bleeding in a 12-year-old as presenting sign for rare undifferentiated sarcoma [^113e8gvf]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Abnormal uterine bleeding is a common phenomenon in perimenarchal females. Though most cases of abnormal bleeding are due to anovulatory bleeding or bleeding disorders, rare cases are attributable to underlying malignancy.

Case

Here we report a 12-year-old female patient who presented with abnormal uterine bleeding three months after menarche. She was ultimately diagnosed with a pelvic sarcoma of unknown primary origin. She was subsequently treated with chemotherapy, whole pelvic radiation, and hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.

Summary

Abnormal uterine bleeding unresponsive to conventional temporizing measures should be thoroughly evaluated. Management of pelvic malignancies in the pediatric population requires cooperation amongst specialists from an array of disciplines.

### Spontaneous rectal sheath bleed while on DOAC anticoagulation [^114iELLL]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Treatment

The patient was reviewed by the general surgical team on call who advised no surgical intervention at that time. The apixaban was held and his vital signs and haemoglobin concentration were monitored at regular intervals. After 24 hours, his haemoglobin had fallen to 7.7 g/dL and he was subsequently transfused with 2 units of red cell concentrate, after which the haemoglobin returned to 8.7 g/dL. His vital signs remained stable throughout the admission. It is notable that the pulse rate may have been lowered by his beta-blocker therapy. On the third day of admission the medical team noted extensive ecchymosis on the posterior right abdomen (figure 4). His haemoglobin concentration did not fall significantly during the rest of the admission.

### Incidence and risk factors for intussusception among children in Northern Israel from 1992 to 2009: a retrospective study [^113vuUh8]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Intussusception is among the most common abdominal emergencies among young children. Symptoms include sudden onset of vomiting, abdominal pain, intermittent lethargy and irritability, and rectal bleeding that has been described as "currant jelly". Reduction is usually accomplished by air or barium enema, and in some cases by surgery, with or without bowel resection. Intussusception primarily affects young children, with highest incidence in infants aged 4–10 months. Reported yearly estimates of intussusception vary among populations and regions from 20 to 100 per 100,000 infants, but a higher incidence has also been reported.

The causes of intussusception are not fully understood, yet, there is evidence linking recent episodes of gastroenteritis and increased risk of intussusception. Adenovirus was repeatedly recovered in higher proportions from fecal samples of patients with intussusception compared with control children, however no association has been found between natural rotavirus infection and intussusception.

In 1998 the reassortant rhesus human tetravalent oral rotavirus vaccine (RotaShield, Wyeth-Lederle, Pearl River, NY) was licensed in the United States. Shortly after its introduction into the routine childhood vaccination schedule, an excess risk for intussusception was found within 2 weeks after immunization with the first dose [1 intussusception case per 10,000 vaccinees. Consequently the vaccine was withdrawn from the market in 1999. Large clinical trials with two recent oral rotavirus vaccines (RotaTeq (Merck) and Rotarix (GSK)), and early post-marketing studies showed no significant increase in post-immunization intussusception. However, later studies showed that in some settings e.g. Australia, and Mexico, there is an increased risk of intussusception during the first week post vaccination with the first dose of either rotavirus vaccine. At present, this rare adverse event is estimated at about 1–2 intussusception cases per 100,000 vaccine recipients, nonetheless the vaccine's benefits clearly exceed this small risk, thus rotavirus vaccines are recommended for use worldwide. It is important to establish the baseline incidence of intussusception to assess the safety of rotavirus vaccines in countries considering the introduction of rotavirus vaccination.

### Polyposis syndromes: pediatric implications [^112U5Xhi]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

The diagnosis of a polyposis syndrome, such as juvenile polyposis, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, and familial adenomatous polyposis, requires knowledge of the site, number, and histologic type of the polyps and an appreciation of relevant family history. Children and adolescents with polyposis syndromes are faced with not only the immediate complications of the polyps, such as intussusception or bleeding, but also the extraintestinal manifestations and the long-term risk for malignancy. This article reviews the diagnosis, clinical management, surveillance, and surgical options for children with polyposis syndromes and discusses genetics and appropriate screening programs.

Diagnosis of mpox — A high index of suspicion is warranted for mpox. Clinical presentation with symptoms such as a characteristic rash is strongly suggestive of mpox; however, diagnosis of mpox based solely on clinical presentation can be challenging because illness can be atypical with isolated proctitis or rectal bleeding or a small number of lesions, lesions can mimic herpes zoster, herpes simplex, syphilis, and molluscum contagiosum, and due to the high frequency of coinfection with STIs during the multinational 2022 clade II mpox outbreak, a broad differential diagnosis is encouraged.

### Juvenile polyp in Thai children – clinical and colonoscopic presentation [^1168FdDN]. World Journal of Surgery (2007). Low credibility.

Background

The aim of this prospective study was to describe the clinical characteristics of colorectal polyp in Thai children.

Methods

From December 2002 to February 2005, children under 15 years of age presenting with rectal bleeding were prospectively enrolled. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory information was recorded. Location, number, characteristics, and histopathology of the polyps were noted.

Results

There were 32 patients with a mean age of 6.5 years. The most common presenting symptom was hematochezia, followed by prolapsing rectal mass and diarrhea. In 20 patients there was a single polyp, 6 had 2–4 polyps, and 6 were diagnosed with polyposis coli. Most of the polyps were located exclusively at the rectum and sigmoid colon. In only 7 cases were the polyps proximal to the rectosigmoid region. This included 6 patients who had polyps beyond the splenic flexure. All were juvenile polyps without evidence of adenomatous changes. Compared to those with isolated polyps, the patients with polyposis coli had a statistically significant incidence of right-sided polyps (P < 0.001) and a history of prolapse of the rectal mass (P = 0.006).

Conclusions

Because of the high prevalence of right-sided polyps and the concern about malignant transformation, colonoscopy should be considered as the initial evaluation in children with rectal bleeding.

Gastrointestinal bleeding requiring surgery in Crohn's disease — in general, surgical treatment is recommended in patients with CD with life-threatening bleeding, persistent hemodynamic instability, or recurrent, significant GI bleeding following nonoperative measures; mortality related to surgical management is high (up to 7%), rebleeding rates are much lower than with nonsurgical intervention (6% versus 39%), two-thirds of patients with CD who bleed have otherwise quiescent disease, a targeted resection is typically recommended when the source has been localized, and when bleeding cannot be localized to 1 segment of the colon, a total colectomy may be necessary.

### Twelve years of endoscopic surveillance in a family carrying biallelic Y165C MYH defect: report of a case [^112jzHEC]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2006). Low credibility.

Purpose

We report the case of two siblings, clinically andendoscopically followed for 12 years, who displayed anattenuated adenomatous polyposis coli phenotype.

Methods

On workup for rectal bleeding with colonoscopy, we found multiple adenomas mainly right-sided in a 21-year-old female and the same colonic phenotype was observed in her 27-year-old brother. We made a clinical diagnosis of attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli and performed APC gene testing. Because they had refused the proposed ileorectal anastomosis surgical option, we planned a periodic, endoscopic follow-up.

Results

Gene testing did not confirm the clinical suspicion of attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli. Actually, we did not find anypathogenic mutation in APC gene and we recently identified a biallelic Y125C MYH defect. During the endoscopic follow-up, a progressive reduction of adenomas was seen.

Conclusions

New insight colorectal cancer genetics have allowed definition of a new class of polyposis that applies to some patients with attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli phenotype as in the siblings we have described. To prevent colorectal cancer without recurring to surgery, colonoscopic polypectomy may be a suitable tool in controlling MYH polyposis.

### Causes of rectal bleeding in children… [^1171YLTt]. publications.aap.org (2001). Low credibility.

Rectal bleeding is a problem commonly seen in the ambulatory pediatric setting. It can be a terrifying finding for caretakers, sometimes heralding significant pathology. Fortunately, most cases of rectal bleeding in children are due to etiologies that have little morbidity. Rectal bleeding was identified as the chief complaint in 0. 3% of all visits presenting to a busy urban emergency department over a 10-month period. Only 4% of affected patients manifested potentially life-threatening conditions. Blood in the stool can be described as melena, hematochezia, or occult blood. Melena refers to a black, tarry stool that usually has a distinct odor. It contains blood that has been present in the gastrointestinal tract for a prolonged period, allowing degradation of hemoglobin by colonic flora. Melena can portend significant blood loss that typically originates from lesions proximal to the ileocecal valve and often above the ligament of Treitz. An example of melena.

### Rectal disorders in childhood… [^115pWAdT]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Rectal disorders in infants and children are not uncommon, and at one time or another every physician or surgeon will be consulted concerning them. In the infant and in the child rectal disturbances will often be manifested by signs and symptoms elsewhere, such as restlessness, irritability, temper, loss of weight, loss of appetite or even convulsions. The child will not direct attention to the terminal part of the bowel, and the lesion may remain unrecognized unless some obvious sign, such as bleeding or protrusion, is observed. There may be little in the past history or in the history of the present illness to direct the examiner's attention to a rectal disturbance. One can say at the outset that a deliberate examination of the anorectum and the sigmoid might in many cases reveal a lesion hitherto unsuspected.
