## Question

Hypercoagulable work up after PE

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about when and how to perform a hypercoagulable (thrombophilia) workup after a pulmonary embolism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and whether the PE was provoked or unprovoked. Then, I should verify which thrombophilia tests are actually indicated and which to avoid. Next, I will consider timing of testing relative to anticoagulation. After that, I need to check how results would change management, including duration of anticoagulation. Finally, I will review special populations and synthesize a practical algorithm with clear takeaways.

> Let me first confirm the clinical context because everything hinges on whether the PE was provoked or unprovoked and by what kind of trigger. Unprovoked PE, especially in younger patients or those with a strong family history, raises the pretest probability of heritable thrombophilia and may justify selective testing, whereas PE provoked by major transient factors like surgery, trauma, or hospitalization generally does not warrant thrombophilia testing because it won't change management or recurrence risk estimates meaningfully [^dd54058f] [^67b6ca95].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions. I should verify which thrombophilias are actually worth testing for. High-risk deficiencies such as antithrombin, protein C, and protein S deficiency, and clinically significant combinations like homozygous factor V Leiden or homozygous prothrombin G20210A, are the ones most likely to alter management or counseling, whereas heterozygous factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A alone are low-risk and routine testing is discouraged in most scenarios [^dd54058f] [^67b6ca95].

> I need to check the timing next, because anticoagulation and acute thrombosis can distort results. Testing should be deferred until at least 4 to 6 weeks after stopping anticoagulation and after the acute event has resolved, since both acute thrombosis and anticoagulants can cause false positives or negatives; for antiphospholipid syndrome, in particular, repeat testing 12 weeks apart is required to confirm persistence, and testing during acute thrombosis or on anticoagulation should be avoided when possible [^a5fe84ac] [^195294b7].

> Next, I should review how results would change management, because testing without actionable outcomes is low value. If a high-risk thrombophilia is found in a patient with unprovoked PE, that supports consideration of indefinite anticoagulation after discussing bleeding risk and patient preferences; conversely, absence of thrombophilia in a low-risk, unprovoked PE patient may support stopping anticoagulation after a standard course, though this remains individualized and evidence is mixed, so shared decision-making is essential [^dd54058f] [^67b6ca95].

> Let me consider special populations and edge cases. In pregnancy or the immediate postpartum period, routine thrombophilia testing is not recommended, but if there is a personal or strong family history of VTE, selective testing may be considered to inform future pregnancy planning and prophylaxis; in patients with heparin resistance, antithrombin deficiency should be suspected and tested; and in patients with warfarin-associated skin necrosis, protein C or S deficiency should be evaluated [^dd54058f] [^67b6ca95].

> Wait, I should double-check the role of antiphospholipid syndrome screening, because it's often overordered. APS testing should be limited to patients with unprovoked VTE who have clinical features suspicious for APS, such as arterial thrombosis, thrombosis at unusual sites, recurrent miscarriages, autoimmune disease, or a prolonged aPTT, and results should be interpreted with caution given frequent false positives on anticoagulation and the need for confirmatory repeat testing [^a5fe84ac] [^195294b7].

> I will now examine the practical test panel so I don't over-order low-yield assays. A focused panel includes antithrombin activity, protein C activity, protein S activity, and, when indicated, lupus anticoagulant with anticardiolipin and anti–beta-2-glycoprotein I antibodies for APS; factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A are generally not tested unless there is a compelling indication or a known family mutation, and broad panels without a clear indication should be avoided [^dd54058f] [^67b6ca95].

> But wait, what if the PE was provoked by a nonsurgical transient factor like estrogen or pregnancy? Does that change testing? The ASH 2023 guideline suggests that in patients with VTE provoked by nonsurgical major transient factors or by estrogen exposure, testing may be considered to refine recurrence risk and guide duration, though this is a weaker recommendation and should be balanced against the limited incremental value and the risk of overtesting [^1db59f6b].

> Let me synthesize a practical algorithm without oversimplifying. For unprovoked PE, especially in patients younger than 50 years or with a strong family history, consider selective testing for high-risk thrombophilias after stopping anticoagulation for 4 to 6 weeks and ensure results would change management; for provoked PE, especially by surgery, trauma, or major illness, do not test; for APS, test only when clinical suspicion is present and confirm results with repeat testing; and in all cases, use shared decision-making to align testing and treatment duration with patient values and bleeding risk [^dd54058f] [^67b6ca95].

> Hold on, I should verify the bottom line so I don't miss anything critical. Routine thrombophilia testing after PE is not recommended; testing is reserved for select scenarios where results are likely to alter anticoagulation duration or reproductive counseling, and even then, timing and assay selection matter to avoid misleading results and unnecessary treatment [^dd54058f] [^67b6ca95].

A hypercoagulable workup after PE is **not routinely indicated** [^dd54058f] and should be reserved for select scenarios where results would change management [^67b6ca95]. Test when PE is **unprovoked** [^67b6ca95], especially in patients < 50 years old, with a strong family history, or with recurrent VTE [^dd54058f]. Also consider testing for **antiphospholipid syndrome** [^a5fe84ac] if there are features such as arterial thrombosis, pregnancy morbidity, or a prolonged aPTT [^195294b7]. Avoid testing during acute thrombosis or while on anticoagulation; wait 2–4 weeks after stopping anticoagulation and repeat APS labs after 12 weeks to confirm persistence [^a5fe84ac]. Routine testing in provoked PE or before stopping anticoagulation is not recommended [^dd54058f] [^67b6ca95].

---

## Indications for hypercoagulable workup after PE

Hypercoagulable testing is **not routinely indicated** after a first PE [^dd54058f]; it is reserved for specific clinical scenarios where results may influence management or counseling [^67b6ca95]. The following situations warrant consideration of hypercoagulable testing:

- **Unprovoked PE**: Particularly in patients younger than 50 years old, with a strong family history of VTE, or with recurrent VTE events [^67b6ca95] [^dd54058f].

- **Suspected antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)**: Clinical features such as arterial thrombosis, pregnancy morbidity (recurrent miscarriages, stillbirths, severe preeclampsia), or unexplained prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) [^a5fe84ac] [^195294b7].

- **Heparin resistance**: Suspected antithrombin deficiency in patients requiring unusually high doses of heparin to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation [^dd54058f].

- **Warfarin-induced skin necrosis**: Suspected protein C or protein S deficiency [^dd54058f].

---

## Recommended tests for hypercoagulable workup

The selection of tests should be **guided by clinical suspicion** and the suspected underlying disorder:

| **Category** | **Recommended tests** |
|-|-|
| Inherited thrombophilia | - Antithrombin activity <br/> - Protein C activity <br/> - Protein S activity (free and total) <br/> - Factor V Leiden mutation (PCR) <br/> - Prothrombin G20210A mutation (PCR) <br/> - Homocysteine levels [^dd54058f] |
| Acquired thrombophilia | - Lupus anticoagulant (dilute Russell viper venom test, kaolin clotting time) <br/> - Anticardiolipin antibodies (IgG and IgM) <br/> - Anti-beta-2-glycoprotein I antibodies (IgG and IgM) [^a5fe84ac] |

---

## Timing of hypercoagulable testing

Timing is critical to ensure **accurate results**. Testing should be performed:

- **After acute thrombosis**: Wait at least 2–4 weeks after the acute event to avoid transient changes in coagulation factors [^a5fe84ac].

- **Off anticoagulation**: Discontinue anticoagulation for 2–4 weeks prior to testing, if clinically safe, to prevent interference with assay results [^a5fe84ac].

- **APS confirmation**: Repeat testing after 12 weeks to confirm persistence of antiphospholipid antibodies, as transient positivity is common [^a5fe84ac].

---

## Clinical implications of hypercoagulable testing results

Results of hypercoagulable testing can **significantly influence clinical management**:

- **Inherited thrombophilia**: Presence of high-risk thrombophilia (e.g. antithrombin, protein C, protein S deficiency, homozygous factor V Leiden) may support extended or indefinite anticoagulation after a first unprovoked VTE event [^dd54058f] [^67b6ca95].

- **Antiphospholipid syndrome**: Requires indefinite anticoagulation, preferably with warfarin, due to high recurrence risk and limited evidence for direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) efficacy [^a5fe84ac].

- **Family counseling**: Identification of hereditary thrombophilia may prompt counseling and testing of asymptomatic relatives, particularly in families with a strong history of VTE [^dd54058f].

---

## Limitations and controversies

Despite potential benefits, hypercoagulable testing has several **limitations and controversies**:

- **Limited predictive value**: Many thrombophilias have modest associations with recurrence risk, and testing may not reliably predict future events [^67b6ca95].

- **Overuse**: Routine testing in provoked VTE or before stopping anticoagulation is common but not supported by evidence or guidelines [^dd54058f] [^67b6ca95].

- **Psychological impact**: Positive results may cause anxiety and lead to unnecessary interventions [^notfound].

---

## Current guidelines and expert consensus

Current guidelines emphasize a **selective approach** to hypercoagulable testing:

- **Routine testing**: Not recommended for all patients with PE; reserved for specific clinical scenarios [^dd54058f] [^67b6ca95].

- **Unprovoked VTE**: Consider testing in younger patients, those with recurrent events, or strong family history [^67b6ca95] [^dd54058f].

- **APS suspicion**: Test in patients with clinical features suggestive of APS [^a5fe84ac] [^195294b7].

- **Provoked VTE**: Generally do not test, as results are unlikely to change management [^dd54058f] [^67b6ca95].

---

Hypercoagulable workup after PE is **not routine** and should be reserved for select scenarios where results would change management or counseling [^dd54058f]. Testing is most appropriate in unprovoked PE, especially in younger patients or those with a strong family history, and in suspected APS [^67b6ca95] [^a5fe84ac]. Results can guide anticoagulation duration and family counseling, but testing should be timed correctly and interpreted in clinical context [^dd54058f].

Pulmonary embolism is a common, yet often unsuspected and unrecognised disease associated with a high mortality. New, objective, "user friendly" and cost effective diagnostic strategies are being explored. D-dimers, the fibrinolytic degradation products of crosslinked fibrin, have emerged as the most useful of the procoagulant activity and ongoing fibrinolysis markers. D-dimer measurements are very sensitive in excluding a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in the setting of normal values, a low clinical suspicion, and non-diagnostic lung scans. Several assays have been developed and are reviewed.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality worldwide. Clinical presentation can be diverse, and clinicians should have a high index of suspicion regarding the diagnosis. Evaluation should include detailed history of possible risk factors, physical examination and laboratory tests that would support the diagnosis and help risk-stratify patients. Finally, a dedicated imaging study should be performed in order to make a definitive diagnosis. Decisions regarding short-term, immediate, treatment are dictated by PE risk category. Treatment of low and high-risk PE is relatively straightforward. But treating moderate risk PE is challenging since aggressive treatment is not devoid of potential harm. This review focuses on the acute and chronic treatment of PE. We present risk stratification, guidance as to treatment choice and insights into chronic treatment with available anticoagulants.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) — intermediate pretest probability: For patients at intermediate risk for PE, D-dimer testing is warranted. As for patients at low pretest probability, a normal plasma D-dimer level (ideally, age-adjusted [age × 10 ng/mL] but otherwise < 500 ng/mL) provides sufficient negative predictive value for PE; no imaging studies are indicated, and an elevated plasma D-dimer level should prompt imaging studies.

### Comparison of international guideline recommendations for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^4457a683]. The Lancet: Haematology (2023). High credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is one of the leading causes of death due to cardiovascular disease. Timely diagnosis is crucial, but challenging, as the clinical presentation of pulmonary embolism is unspecific and easily mistaken for other common medical emergencies. Clinical prediction rules and D-dimer measurement allow stratification of patients into groups of expected prevalence and are key elements in adequate selection of patients for diagnostic imaging; however, the strengths and weaknesses of the multiple proposed prediction rules, when to measure D-dimer, and which cutoff to apply might be elusive to a significant proportion of physicians. 13 international guidelines authored by medical societies or expert author groups provide recommendations on facets of the diagnostic investigations in suspected pulmonary embolism, some of which are hallmarked by pronounced heterogeneity. This Review summarises key recommendations of each guideline, considers the most recent evidence on the topic, compares guideline recommendations on each facet of the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, and provides a synthesis on the most common recommendations.

### Nonspecific tests for pulmonary embolism [^45ec4201]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2001). Low credibility.

Many tests have been proposed as useful in the diagnostic evaluation of suspected PE, but nonspecific tests for PE can only add to the level of suspicion one has for the diagnosis. As Anderson indicates, "virtually all clinical and laboratory findings neither diagnose nor exclude the diagnosis of PE. They merely serve to heighten suspicion of the diagnosis and prompt the clinician to pursue additional diagnostic studies". D-dimer measurement is promising as a test to exclude PE in young healthy out-patients, and further study and improvements in technology, can clarify the usefulness of the different methods of performing this assay. For now, diagnostic algorithms for PE should continue to incorporate multiple tests and decision points, but the standard remains specialized imaging techniques.

### Pulmonary embolism… [^3dd61b81]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. A pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that blocks the blood vessels supplying the lungs. The clot most often comes from the leg veins and travels through the heart to the lungs. When the blood clot lodges in the blood vessels of the lung, it may limit the heart's ability to deliver blood to the lungs, causing shortness of breath and chest pain, and, in serious cases, death. The US surgeon general estimates that 100 000 to 180 000 deaths occur from PE each year in the United States and identifies PE as the most preventable cause of death among hospitalized patients. The January 9, 2013, issue of JAMA contains an article about management of PE. Risk factors Genetic and acquired tendencies to develop blood clots.

Pregnancy; use of birth control pills or hormone therapy Obesity Smoking Cancer Medical illnesses including heart disease, lung disease, and kidney disease Older age Recent surgery, trauma, hospitalization, or prolonged bed rest Signs and symptoms Shortness of breath Chest discomfort Coughing up blood. Palpitations Dizziness and fainting Leg swelling and discomfort Treatment Anticoagulants are the main treatment for pulmonary embolism and work by preventing new blood clots from forming while the body breaks down the pulmonary embolism. Options for anticoagulation in patients with PE include intravenous heparin and injectable enoxaparin, dalteparin, and fondaparinux. Oral anticoagulants for PE include warfarin and rivaroxaban. Most patients with PE receive at least 6 months of anticoagulation treatment. Many patients are advised to continue anticoagulation treatment for longer than 6 months, sometimes lifelong, if their risk of recurrent PE is high.

For some patients with large or massive pulmonary embolism, more aggressive therapy is required. These treatments include clot-dissolving medications, invasive procedures to remove the embolus with catheters or surgery, and implantation of a filter device to catch free blood clots before they reach the heart.

### Current approach to the diagnosis of acute nonmassive pulmonary embolism [^ebc254e8]. Chest (2011). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is a common and potentially lethal disease. Given the variable presentation and associated morbidity of this condition, an accurate and efficient diagnostic algorithm is required. Clinical pretest probability serves as the root of any diagnostic approach. We, thus, review several clinical decision rules that may help standardize this determination. Using a review of the literature, the accuracy, predictive values, and likelihood ratios for several diagnostic tests are described. The combination of these tests, based on the pretest probability of disease, can be used in a Bayesian fashion to make accurate treatment decisions. A completely noninvasive diagnostic algorithm for patients presenting with suspected acute pulmonary embolism is proposed.

### Management of venous thromboembolism in patients with primary and metastatic brain tumors… [^cde0500e]. ASCO (2006). Low credibility.

Abstract Venous thromboembolism occurs commonly throughout the clinical course of patients with brain tumors. A number of hemostatic and clinical factors contribute to this hypercoagulable state. Concern over the possibility of intracranial bleeding has limited the use of anticoagulation in this population. However, mechanical approaches such as vena cava filters have high complication and treatment failure rates in patients with intracranial malignancies. 1-4Within this hypercoagulable population, patients with brain tumors have a particularly high incidence of VTE. Early diagnosis and treatment of this complication are essential. Left untreated, about half of all patients with symptomatic, proximal deep venous thromboses will develop clinically evident pulmonary emboli, 5which carry mortality rates of 17% to 34%. 6, 7In one postoperative series, seven of 19 patients with brain tumors who developed PE "died within minutes to hours of the clinical episode. " 8.

Clinical Factors In addition to coagulation abnormalities, several clinical risk factors predispose these patients to thromboembolism. Larger and higher-grade tumors have been associated with a greater risk of VTE. 19, 27, 35Large tumors may have a greater impact on ambulation or result in more TF production. High-grade tumors have been shown to express higher levels of TF, which may precipitate greater activation of coagulation. 36As in other patient populations, age, ABO blood group status, chemotherapy exposure, longer anesthesia times, and immobility have also been linked with increased VTE risk in patients with brain tumors. Although many experts recommend avoiding full-dose anticoagulation within 10 to 14 days of neurosurgery. 74Other studies support re-anticoagulation after 3 to 5 days. 75–78 Issues of poor compliance, inability to follow up with laboratory monitoring, or high fall risk should also be weighed carefully in treatment decisions.

Recent systemic bleeding, severe hypertension, and endocarditis are relative contraindications to anticoagulation. Thrombolytic agents, used in cases of life-threatening PE, are absolutely contraindicated in patients with intracranial tumors. Given the persistent hypercoagulable state of patients with brain tumors, the possible use of long-term primary prophylaxis outside the hospital setting has been raised. Targeting a particularly high-risk subgroup, perhaps based on the clinical characteristics listed in Table 1, would limit the complications of anticoagulation to those patients who need it most.

### Practical guide to management after an acute pulmonary embolism [^03c8bf62]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Follow-up after acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is important to assess recovery, consider the need for on-going anticoagulation and identify chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), a rare but serious complication of PE. 16 dilemmas in the follow-up of acute PE were identified by a steering committee of four pulmonologists and a haematologist with interest in PE and/or CTEPH. Current literature was reviewed and a practical approach suggested based on expert consensus. Dilemmas discussed included: (1) how to manage a breathless patient; (2) what to do if CTEPH is suspected; (3) the difference between CTEPH and post-PE syndrome, (4) testing for thrombophilia, (5) when to investigate for cancer, (6) anticoagulation duration and dose, (7) approaches to discussions and decision-making with respect to anticoagulation, (8) use of aspirin and whether antiplatelet therapy should be stopped during anticoagulation and (9) advice for patients on discharge from hospital at 3 months and information for first-degree relatives. Given the occurrence of complications that may require assessment, follow-up of patients post-PE should be systematic and consider the individual needs of the patient.

Acute pulmonary embolism — overuse and harms: Well-validated decision rules have found that the risk for PE in patients who do not meet their criteria for additional testing is very low, and despite a significant increase in diagnoses of PE, mortality has remained unchanged, suggesting that we are overdiagnosing PE that are not clinically significant. Harms of imaging include radiation exposure, contrast-induced nephropathy and contrast allergy, cost, overdiagnosis and resultant overtreatment with anticoagulants, and detection and work-up of incidental findings.

### Pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis [^b253aa70]. Lancet (2012). Excellent credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is the third most common cause of death from cardiovascular disease after heart attack and stroke. Sequelae occurring after venous thromboembolism include chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and post-thrombotic syndrome. Venous thromboembolism and atherothrombosis share common risk factors and the common pathophysiological characteristics of inflammation, hypercoagulability, and endothelial injury. Clinical probability assessment helps to identify patients with low clinical probability for whom the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism can be excluded solely with a negative result from a plasma D-dimer test. The diagnosis is usually confirmed with compression ultrasound showing deep vein thrombosis or with chest CT showing pulmonary embolism. Most patients with venous thromboembolism will respond to anticoagulation, which is the foundation of treatment. Patients with pulmonary embolism should undergo risk stratification to establish whether they will benefit from the addition of advanced treatment, such as thrombolysis or embolectomy. Several novel oral anticoagulant drugs are in development. These drugs, which could replace vitamin K antagonists and heparins in many patients, are prescribed in fixed doses and do not need any coagulation monitoring in the laboratory. Although rigorous clinical trials have reported the effectiveness and safety of pharmacological prevention with low, fixed doses of anticoagulant drugs, prophylaxis remains underused in patients admitted to hospital at moderate risk and high risk for venous thromboembolism. In this Seminar, we discuss pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis of the legs.

Heritable thrombophilia

It is not recommended to test for heritable thrombophilia in most patients with a first VTE/PE. However, there are select patient populations in which testing is indicated:

Patients with unfractionated heparin/low molecular weight heparin resistance should be tested for antithrombin deficiency.
Patients with skin necrosis associated with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) should be tested for protein C and S deficiency.

Similarly, case finding among asymptomatic relatives of patients with a history of VTE is not recommended in most cases, as the annual risk of thrombosis in family members is low. It is not indicated in asymptomatic relatives of those with low risk thrombophilia (such as factor V Leiden) and, in high risk thrombophilia (such as antithrombin deficiency or protein C or S deficiency), case finding should only be considered in families who are prone to thrombosis (one first-degree or two second-degree relatives with VTE).

In those with confirmed deficiency of antithrombin, protein C or protein S, and patients with homozygous factor V Leiden or homozygous prothrombin G20210A mutation, long-term anticoagulation should be considered after a first episode of PE occurring in the absence of a major reversible risk factor. The 2019 ESC guidelines on management of acute PE advise that testing for thrombophilia may also be considered in patients whose PE occurs at a relatively young age (< 50 years) in the absence of any provoking risk factors, particularly if they have a strong family history of VTE, as testing in these patients may be helpful for treatment decisions. However, it is important to note that thrombophilia testing should not be routinely conducted for unselected patients in order to inform decisions on the duration of anticoagulant treatment; rather, these decisions should be based on the presence or absence of a provoking risk factor for VTE/PE and the risk of bleeding during treatment.

When should I investigate for cancer in a patient with VTE?

One in 20 patients who present with VTE is diagnosed with cancer within 12 months. The multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled 'screening for occult malignancy in patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism' trial found that routine screening with CT scans of patients with a first unprovoked VTE did not result in a significant improvement in time to cancer diagnosis or cancer-related mortality versus limited occult cancer screening. Therefore, the updated 2020 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on the management of VTE do not recommend routine screening of cancer in patients with an unprovoked VTE. The decision on whether to investigate for cancer should be based on physical examination and medical history of symptoms, as described in the 2015 NICE guidelines for recognition and referral of suspected cancer. An interactive cancer screening tool is available from NICE. Age-specific and gender-specific testing (eg, mammography, cervical smear and prostate specific antigen testing) should be implemented in accordance with national guidelines and local practice. During follow-up after acute PE, the threshold to suspect cancer should be low in patients with a relatively recent history of cured cancer (eg, within 5 years, as VTE can be a sign of recurrent cancer), early VTE progression/recurrence despite anticoagulant treatment and anticoagulant-related bleeding shortly after start of treatment (particularly gastrointestinal bleeding or haematuria).

When should I test for thrombophilia?

Thrombophilia is defined as the increased tendency to form blood clots and there are heritable and acquired forms. Genetic causes of heritable thrombophilia include Factor V Leiden/prothrombin gene mutations, antithrombin deficiency and protein C and S deficiency. Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is the most common form of acquired thrombophilia.

### Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism… [^76e492c9]. CDC (2025). Medium credibility.

Pathogenesis Virchow's classic triad for thrombus formation is venous stasis, vessel wall damage, and a hypercoagulable state. Prolonged, cramped sitting during long-distance travel interferes with venous flow in the legs, creating venous stasis. Seat-edge pressure to the popliteal area of the legs can aggravate venous stasis and contribute to vessel wall damage. Coagulation activation can result from an interaction between air cabin conditions and individual risk factors for VTE. Studies of the pathophysiologic mechanisms for the increased risk of VTE after long-distance travel have not produced consistent results, but venous stasis appears to play a major role. Other factors specific to air travel might increase coagulation activation, particularly in travelers with preexisting risk factors for VTE. Clinical presentation Signs and symptoms of DVT/PE are nonspecific.

Typical signs or symptoms of DVT in the extremities include pain or tenderness, swelling, warmth in the affected area, and redness or discoloration of the overlying skin. The most common signs or symptoms of acute PE include unexplained shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, cough or hemoptysis, and syncope. Treatment Anticoagulant medications commonly are used to treat DVT or PE; anticoagulants also are used for VTE prophylaxis. Bleeding can be a complication of anticoagulant therapy. The most frequently used injectable anticoagulants are unfractionated heparin, low molecular weight heparin, and fondaparinux. Oral anticoagulants include apixaban, betrixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, rivaroxaban, and warfarin.

American College of Chest Physicians guidelines For long-distance travelers at increased risk of VTE, the ACCP recommends frequent ambulation, calf muscle exercise, sitting in an aisle seat, and using properly fitted below-the-knee GCS that provide 15–30 mmHg of pressure at the ankle during travel. For long-distance travelers not at increased risk of VTE, use of GCS is not recommended. ACCP advises against the use of aspirin or anticoagulants to prevent VTE in long-distance travelers.

### D-dimer levels for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism: making sense of international guideline recommendations [^487dbc58]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). Medium credibility.

Several international guidelines provide recommendations around the use of D-dimer testing for exclusion of pulmonary embolism, including the appropriate D-dimer threshold (or cutoff), but there is no consensus among them. We briefly discuss guideline variation, performance characteristics, and limitations of commercially available D-dimer assays in this setting, referencing the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines that recommend immunoassays with high sensitivity (≥ 97%) and negative predictive value (≥ 98%). While age-adjusted D-dimer and pretest-adjusted D-dimer are considered a safe strategy across predefined patient subgroups, clinicians need to recognize the different performance characteristics of D-dimer assays to enable safe clinical decisions for their patients. Importantly, D-dimer values must be correlated not only to clinical findings but also interpreted within the context of the accuracy and precision of the specific testing modality, adhering to manufacturer specifications that are approved by regulatory authorities.

Inherited and acquired thrombophilia

Inherited thrombophilia can be detected in up to 30% of VTE patients. However, screening for inherited thrombophilia should only be performed if the results of testing are expected to modify (i) patient management in terms of type, dosage, or duration of anticoagulant therapy or (ii) counselling on oral contraception or prophylactic measures during pregnancy for female first degree relatives. In particular, the presence of inherited thrombophilia should not drive the choice of anticoagulant drug class or its intensity. Notably, in younger patients without identifiable strong risk factors for VTE recurrence and without a strong family history of VTE, in whom the physician and patient are considering anticoagulant treatment discontinuation, the absence of inherited thrombophilia might support the latter decision. Seven of 16 panel members would use the results of genetic thrombophilia testing to support clinical decisions for young patients (e.g. age < 50 years) with unprovoked PE if validated risk assessment models suggest a low risk of recurrence. In their opinion, the presence of inherited thrombophilia may, under those circumstances, support a decision in favour of indefinite anticoagulation. The remaining nine panel members considered available evidence insufficient to support this practice.

Abstract

This position paper provides a comprehensive guide for optimal follow-up of patients with acute pulmonary embolism (PE), covering multiple relevant aspects of patient counselling. It serves as a practical guide to treating patients with acute PE complementary to the formal 2019 European Society of Cardiology guidelines developed with the European Respiratory Society. We propose a holistic approach considering the whole spectrum of serious adverse events that patients with acute PE may encounter on the short and long run. We underline the relevance of assessment of modifiable risk factors for bleeding, of acquired thrombophilia and limited cancer screening (unprovoked PE) as well as a dedicated surveillance for the potential development of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension as part of routine practice; routine testing for genetic thrombophilia should be avoided. We advocate the use of outcome measures for functional outcome and quality of life to quantify the impact of the PE diagnosis and identify patients with the post-PE syndrome early. Counselling patients on maintaining a healthy lifestyle mitigates the risk of the post-PE syndrome and improves cardiovascular prognosis. Therefore, we consider it important to discuss when and how to resume sporting activities soon after diagnosing PE. Additional patient-relevant topics that require Focused counselling are travel and birth control.

### Decreasing D-dimer after recent negative computed tomographic pulmonary angiogram does not rule out pulmonary embolism [^af6a2b23]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

An algorithmic approach to testing utilizing risk stratification and quantitative D-dimer has been considered an acceptable approach to ruling out pulmonary embolism (PE). When D-dimer is elevated, further testing for PE is indicated. However, no evidence exists to guide practitioners when patients return after a recent negative workup for PE who previously had an elevated D-dimer. This case describes a patient who initially had an elevated D-dimer with negative workup for PE who, on repeat visit, had a decreasing D-dimer but was diagnosed with a PE. When evaluating patients after a negative workup for PE after an elevated D-dimer, a decrease in D-dimer cannot be used to rule out PE.

Antiphospholipid syndrome (acquired thrombophilia)

The following list of risk factors for APS can be used to determine when a diagnosis should be considered and investigated (box 1).

Box 1
Risk factors for antiphospholipid syndrome

History of systemic lupus erythematosus or another autoimmune disease.
Presence of livedo reticularis.
Prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time prior to starting anticoagulation.
Recurrent thrombosis.
Venous thromboembolism at unusual sites.
History of arterial thrombosis without clear risk factors.
Thrombocytopaenia.
Recurrent miscarriages, stillbirth and/or severe pre-eclampsia.
Cardiac valve abnormalities in the absence of other explanations.

A diagnosis of APS is given if patients meet at least one clinical criteria and at least one laboratory criteria from the Sapporo classification of APS (box 2). Laboratory testing should only be conducted if the clinical criteria are met. It should be noted that, while all anticoagulants interfere with clotting assays, lupus anticoagulant testing is particularly prone to high rates of false positives in patients treated with VKAs and direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)and also if tested at the time of the acute VTE.

Box 2
Clinical and laboratory criteria for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome

The 2023 American College of Rheumatology/EULAR (European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology) classification criteria for APS were designed as highly specific criteria for use in observational studies and trials and, as such, have higher specificity (but lower sensitivity) than the Sapporo classification criteria.

### Diagnostic strategies for suspected pulmonary embolism [^1a32ac95]. The European Respiratory Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism often remains a difficult diagnosis for the clinician, particularly in patients with comorbidity factors. This is in contrast with the availability of effective treatment, which should be prescribed as soon as possible. To date, there is still no ideal diagnostic test that is accurate, safe, readily available and cost-effective. Recent technical advances in computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and laboratory findings have raised new possibilities in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. This review covers the performance of different diagnostic tests, and focuses on the advantages and limitations of single diagnostic tests and the clinical usefulness of these tests in diagnostic strategies.

Deep vein thrombosis epidemiology and diagnostic testing — DVT is a common condition that affects approximately one in 1,000 persons per year. Objective testing for DVT is crucial because clinical assessment alone is unreliable, and the consequences of misdiagnosis are serious, including fatal pulmonary embolism (PE). Three categories of tests are typically used to determine the probability of DVT: (1) clinical probability assessment based on patient history and clinical findings, (2) D-dimer assays, and (3) imaging studies (most commonly venous ultrasonography [US] and less frequently venography, CT scan, or MRI).

The prevalence of confirmed antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS) can be as high as 9% in patients with a first unprovoked VTE. Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are currently not recommended in patients with acute PE and APS, particularly in the presence of a double or triple positive APS. Therefore, we propose limiting APS screening to patients with unprovoked PE presenting with signs or concomitant conditions that may raise the suspicion of APS. Twelve of the 16 panel members proposed to test patients with unprovoked PE for APS (only) in case of prior episodes of arterial or small-vessel thrombosis, prior thrombosis at unusual sites, pregnancy complications such as recurrent miscarriage or pre-eclampsia/eclampsia, autoimmune diseases, younger age (< 50 years), or patients with an unexplained pre-treatment prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time. The panel suggests to avoid testing for APS during the first 4–6 weeks after the PE diagnosis because of potential unwanted interfering with the test, which may lead to both false-positive as well as false-negative results. For the interpretation of the type and titre of antiphospholipid antibodies, we refer to the statement made by the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) as the present position paper does not aim at exploring laboratory issues in detail. All panel members agree that the ISTH document sets the standards for this specific point. We further propose that the option of switching to a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) should be discussed with patients with confirmed APS who are already on a NOAC and who have remained free of recurrent thromboembolic events. Preliminary long-term follow-up data from a phase III trial suggest that switching from NOAC to VKA may be beneficial also within 2 years of VTE diagnosis.

### Venous thrombosis [^fd761b3f]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2015). Medium credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) encompasses deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism. VTE is the leading cause of lost disability-adjusted life years and the third leading cause of cardiovascular death in the world. DVT leads to post-thrombotic syndrome, whereas pulmonary embolism can cause chronic pulmonary hypertension, both of which reduce quality of life. Genetic and acquired risk factors for thrombosis include non-O blood groups, factor V Leiden mutation, oral contraceptive use, hormone replacement therapy, advanced age, surgery, hospitalization and long-haul travel. A combination of blood stasis, plasma hypercoagulability and endothelial dysfunction is thought to trigger thrombosis, which starts most often in the valve pockets of large veins. Animal studies have revealed pathogenic roles for leukocytes, platelets, tissue factor-positive microvesicles, neutrophil extracellular traps and factors XI and XII. Diagnosis of VTE requires testing and exclusion of other pathologies, and typically involves laboratory measures (such as D-dimer) and diagnostic imaging. VTE is treated with anticoagulants and occasionally with thrombolytics to prevent thrombus extension and to reduce thrombus size. Anticoagulants are also used to reduce recurrence. New therapies with improved safety profiles are needed to prevent and treat venous thrombosis. For an illustrated summary of this Primer, visit: http://go.nature.com/8ZyCuY.

### American Society of Hematology 2018 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: diagnosis of venous thromboembolism [^1d23f3fe]. Blood Advances (2018). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism — intermediate pretest probability (~20%) — the ASH guideline panel suggests using a strategy starting with D-dimer for excluding PE in a population with intermediate prevalence/PTP (~20%), followed by VQ scan or CTPA for patients requiring additional testing; if D-dimer or VQ scan are not available or testing would delay treatment in high suspicion, proceeding directly to VQ scan or CTPA alone is acceptable, and patients likely to have a nondiagnostic VQ scan should undergo CTPA. The panel also recommends against using a positive D-dimer alone to diagnose PE, and against additional testing following negative CTPA or normal VQ scan in a population with intermediate prevalence/PTP (~20%). Remarks note that a negative D-dimer rules out PE and no additional testing or anticoagulation is required; D-dimer has limited utility in hospitalized and certain patient populations (postsurgical, pregnant) due to frequent positive results; in outpatients older than 50 years an age-adjusted D-dimer can be used (age [years] × 10 μg/L with assays having a cutoff of 500 μg/L); VQ scan is preferred over CTPA as the subsequent test to limit radiation exposure when expertise and timely interpretation are available, with CTPA preferred when VQ is not feasible; results should be obtained under optimal conditions, with suboptimal D-dimer or CTPA possibly requiring repeat testing, and nondiagnostic VQ scans followed by CTPA.

### Discretionary thrombophilia test acquisition and outcomes in patients with venous thromboembolism in a real-world clinical setting [^ac002d5d]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep‐vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, affects ≈300 000 to 600 000 individuals annually in the United States. 1 Patients with VTE are at increased risk for future thromboembolism, with recurrence rates as high as 30% at 10 years. 2, 3 Anticoagulants serve as the backbone of VTE therapy to prevent thromboembolism progression and recurrence. 4, 5, 6, 7 According to current guidelines, the duration of anticoagulant therapy depends on the identification of a provoking factor. VTE events in patients without instigating factors are labeled as unprovoked, and prolonged treatment (eg, > 6 months) is suggested. 5 The failure to identify a VTE precipitant may indicate the possibility of an underlying predisposition to thrombosis, also known as thrombophilia.

Thrombophilia testing is used to identify factors that contribute to a VTE event, to refine the estimated risk of recurrent VTE, and to guide decision‐making regarding the duration of anticoagulant therapy in patients without an instigating factor. 8, 9 Currently, there is no consensus concerning the value of thrombophilia testing in VTE, and its use in clinical practice is highly variable. Indeed, thrombophilia testing is commonly obtained in the absence of an indication, ordered in the setting of anticoagulation, and frequently not repeated for confirmation. 10 Consequently, the usefulness of discretionary thrombophilia testing in current clinical practice to predict recurrence and direct treatment beyond clinical presentation remains unknown. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16

Accordingly, we performed a retrospective analysis of all patients diagnosed with VTE during a 15‐year period in a tertiary care medical center to investigate the effect of discretionary testing for thrombophilia in an unrestricted environment. We did not study the test characteristics of any individual thrombophilia test. We hypothesized that unrestricted thrombophilia testing would not be associated with improved clinical outcomes for tested participants compared with matched control participants who did not undergo thrombophilia testing.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common medical condition that carries significant morbidity and mortality. Although diagnosis, anticoagulation, and interventional clot-burden reduction strategies represent the focus of clinical research and care in PE, appropriate risk stratification and supportive care are crucial to ensure good outcomes. In this chapter, we will discuss the medical management of PE from the time of presentation to discharge, focusing on the critical care of acute right ventricular failure, anticoagulation of special patient populations, and appropriate follow-up testing after acute PE.

Explaining the higher risk of bleeding for patients with thrombolysis in PE Compared with MI?

With identical risk factors, why are patients with PE more prone to adverse bleeding events? And if patients with PE are at higher risk of bleeding, is it reasonable to treat two very different diseases in the same way?

We cannot overemphasise the major difference in the pathophysiology of clot formation, and clot burden between PE and MI. The thrombus composition in PE and deep venous thrombosis consists mainly of fibrin and a varying degree of platelets (red clot). These venous thrombi are often a consequence of either intrinsic factors (surgery, cancer, inherited hypercoagulable states) or mechanisms that predispose the patient to the formation of venous thrombosis as described by Virchow's triad. The arterial thrombus in MI has a different pathogenesis. It is triggered by an underlying atherosclerotic plaque rupture in the context of turbulent flow that induces a shear stress on arterial wall. This stimulates arterial inflammation, which enhances platelet adhesion to the damaged vessel wall, and impairs activation of coagulation factors that cannot aggregate around the formed clot (white clot). The difference in D-dimer levels (a fibrin degradation product), which are much higher in patients with PE compared with patients with MI, supports this mechanistic difference, but also emphasises the greater activation of the fibrinolytic cascade in patients with PE.

### Diagnosis of acute pulmonary embolism [^ee871428]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2017). Low credibility.

Advances in the management of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) have improved diagnostic accuracy and made management algorithms safer, easier to use, and well standardized. These diagnostic algorithms are mainly based on the assessment of clinical pretest probability, D-dimer measurement, and imaging tests-predominantly computed tomography pulmonary angiography. These diagnostic algorithms allow safe and cost-effective diagnosis for most patients with suspected PE. In this review, we summarize signs and symptoms of PE, current existing evidence for PE diagnosis, and focus on the challenge of diagnosing PE in special patient populations, such as pregnant women, or patients with a prior VTE. We also discuss novel imaging tests for PE diagnosis and highlight some of the additional challenges that might require adjustments to current diagnostic strategies, such as the reduced clinical suspicion threshold, resulting in a lower proportion of PE among suspected patients as well as the overdiagnosis of subsegmental PE.

What is new in these ASH guidelines?

The contribution of these guidelines in the broader space of treatment and prevention of VTE is to ensure that a patient-centered, individualized approach is adopted whenever appropriate. Although establishing unbiased estimates of the effect of specific antithrombotic treatments requires large RCTs, the same trials often do not provide sufficiently granular evidence to optimize the choice of whom to treat. Ultimately, the goal is to reduce the number needed to treat as much as possible, thus avoiding treatment of those patients who will not benefit from treatment or denying treatment to those who will.

To accomplish this overarching goal of finding out whether thrombophilia testing could lead to better individualized treatment, we believe the value of testing is to drive subsequent treatment decisions. We have devised an approach to appraise the value of thrombophilia testing built on combining prevalence data (how likely it is for an individual to have thrombophilia), risk association data (how likely it is for an individual with or without thrombophilia to have an event), and measures of treatment effect (how many fewer VTEs and how many more bleeding events will result from treating patients with thrombophilia and not treating patients without thrombophilia). Thus, what our panel decided upon was the number of events prevented (or provoked) by adopting a personalized treatment approach for the patients with a positive result for thrombophilia in several clinical scenarios. Of note, we have included cost, feasibility, acceptability, and equity considerations in the process. We argue that this is the best approach to making an evidence-based decision on the appropriateness of thrombophilia testing until robust prospective observations (and maybe RCTs) confirm or contradict the results of our simulations.

Pulmonary embolism imaging — Table 2 suggestions for patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) specify the following actions using computed tomography (CT) and alternative tests. Immediate CT applies to patients who are "Hemodynamically unstable, with suspected PE" or have "High pretest probability of PE", with the basis that "Risks of inaction outweigh risks of CT" and that there is an "Incidence of PE 19%-28% even with a d-dimer level < 500 ng/mL". Defer CT until after d-dimer result for "Intermediate pretest probability" or "Low pretest probability and PERC > 0", supported by "Low incidence of PE (< 1.1%) if d-dimer level < 500 ng/mL". No CT or d-dimer test is suggested for "Low pretest probability and PERC = 0", given an "Incidence of PE < 1%". For patients with symptoms of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and PE, "Begin with lower-extremity venous ultrasonography", because "Similar treatment will be pursued without exposing the patient to the risks of radiation or intravenous contrast". A safety note states, "Hemodynamic instability may make transport for imaging problematic. Supportive measures or empirical anticoagulation until imaging can be obtained may be required".

Pulmonary embolism — high pretest probability (≥ 50%) — the ASH guideline panel suggests using a strategy starting with computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) for assessing patients suspected of having PE in a population with high prevalence/PTP (≥ 50%). The strategy assumes optimal test conditions; suboptimal CTPA results may require repeat testing. If CTPA is not feasible (eg, contrast allergy, renal impairment, unavailability), VQ scan may be acceptable if nondiagnostic scans are followed by additional testing, and when clinical suspicion remains high despite a negative initial CTPA, additional testing with VQ scan or proximal ultrasound of the lower extremities may be considered. The panel recommends against using a positive D-dimer alone to diagnose PE, and against using D-dimer as a subsequent test following a negative CTPA scan in a population with high prevalence/PTP (≥ 50%).

None of the McMaster University–affiliated researchers who contributed to the systematic evidence reviews or who supported the guideline development process had any current material interest in a commercial entity with any product that could be affected by the guidelines. Supplement 3 provides the complete "Disclosure of Interest" forms of the researchers who made substantial contributions to these guidelines, that is, the 8 researchers who are listed as authors of this report (R.N. M.B. C.C.-A. L.E.C.-L. S.G.K. H.J.S. W.W. and Y.Z.).

Formulating specific clinical questions and determining outcomes of interest

The panel used the GRADEpro Guideline Development Tool and SurveyMonkey to scope and then prioritize the questions described in supplemental Appendix D. Two questions on testing for APS in women with previous placenta-mediated complications or recurrent miscarriage were dropped at the final online panel meetings because of resource constraints.

The panel selected outcomes of interest for each question a priori, following an approach described in detail elsewhere. In brief, the panel first brainstormed all possible outcomes before rating the relative importance of each outcome for decision making. During this rating process, the panel used definitions of the outcomes ("marker states") that were developed for these guidelines. The panel rated the following outcomes as critical for clinical decision making across questions: mortality, pulmonary embolism (PE), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and major bleeding. The panel did not distinguish different clinical severities of locations of DVT and PE, and major bleeding definitions varied across clinical studies.

The panel adopted a threshold-based approach to judging the size of outcome effects and continuously verified during the process the consistency of judgments, noting when exceptions were made (eg, based on the median age of the population of interest). In general, the following thresholds were used to judge the reduction in VTE (first-time or recurrence): trivial: ≤ 5 events per 1000 patient-years; small: 5 to 20 per 1000; moderate: 20 to 50 per 1000. Whenever a different threshold was used, the rationale is reported in the discussion of the specific recommendation.

Problem

Admitting doctors are often criticised for the inappropriate use of investigations in the early stages of diagnosis. This not only wastes resources, but it delays correct diagnosis and can in some cases be harmful to the patient.

The unnecessary measurement of d-dimer in cases of pulmonary embolism (PE) is particularly high.

### Targeting the initial investigation and management in cases of acute pulmonary embolism [^d6c2e65a]. BMJ Quality Improvement Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Background

Symptomatic pulmonary embolism has a > 10% mortality rate in the early stages if left untreated. Patients presenting with the symptom complex including pleuritic chest pain, dyspnoea, haemoptysis and evidence of venous thromboembolic disease may warrant investigation. A serum d-dimer measurement has high sensitivity and low specificity and thus is useful for ruling out PE as a cause of these symptoms if the diagnosis is unlikely. A CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) is both sensitive and specific and is thus ideal for definitive diagnosis of PE. CTPA is limited by a lack of resources and the high dose of radiation required for this test.

The National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) guideline on venous thromboembolic diseases (published June 2012) advises the use of a 2-level Well's score to determine which of these diagnostic tests is required. A low score (unlikely PE) should be investigated with d-dimer first, and CTPA in the event of a positive d-dimer. A high score (likely PE) should be investigated with a CTPA as soon as possible. In either case, if a CTPA is indicated but has been delayed, an interim therapeutic dose of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) should be given.

Close adherence to this guideline is important for quality of care for several reasons:

Patients with likely PE who have an inappropriate d-dimer test will delay treatment with LMWH significantly. Urgent blood tests can take more than one hour from deciding to take the sample to having the result
Efficiently ruling out PE in patients allows for timely investigation of alternative diagnoses
Needless d-dimer tests in patients with high Well's scores is a waste of resources. Likewise, any CTPA without preceding d-dimer test in cases of low likelihood PE is both a waste of resources and a large inappropriate dose of radiation.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) — PERC rule in low pretest probability: In patients with low pretest probability, application of PERC can safely identify patients for whom diagnostic testing is not necessary, and if a patient with low pretest probability of PE meets all 8 PERC criteria, their likelihood of PE is 0.3% and no further testing is required. In a meta-analysis of 12 studies, which included 14 844 patients, the PERC were found to have a sensitivity of 97%. The PERC should not be used in patients with intermediate pretest probability.

### Decision-making with D-dimer in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^bd4c5a72]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The measurement of D-dimer can provide useful information to aid in the diagnosis of patients with suspected venous thromboembolism. D-dimer measurement in conjunction with adequate estimation of pretest probability can facilitate the safe discharge of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism and limit unnecessary investigation or anticoagulation. We review clinical decision-making strategies in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and propose means to minimize diagnostic error that might arise from knowledge of the D-dimer result prior to clinical assessment.

### How we manage a high D-dimer [^926b6489]. Haematologica (2024). Medium credibility.

Conditions associated with increased D-dimer

As mentioned above, D-dimer is used to guide the diagnostic procedure of VTE, which includes DVT and pulmonary embolism. However, while patients with pulmonary embolism or DVT in the acute phase usually have high D-dimer levels, individuals with high D-dimer do not necessarily have an underlying thromboembolic disease, but they may have several other pathological and non-pathological conditions (Table 1).

Venous thromboembolism

To begin, we provide a concise description of the D-dimer-based diagnostic workup of this thrombotic disorder. VTE affects nearly 10 million people every year worldwide, with an annual incidence of 1–2 cases per 1,000 population. It is the third most frequent cardiovascular disease. Although its incidence increases with age both in men and women, women have a higher risk of developing VTE at the young age of 20–40 years due to hormonal-related factors (i.e. pregnancy or oral contraceptive use). Owing to the substantial global burden of VTE, suspected VTE requires a timely and preferably non-invasive diagnostic tool. In this context, thanks to the high sensitivity (almost 100%) of quantitative ELISA, D-dimer measurement plays a key role in the diagnostic workup. However, due to its low specificity (high negative and low positive predictive value), the test should only be used to exclude VTE. This means that a D-dimer negative result (i.e. < 500 µg/L) categorizes patients as having a low to moderate clinical pre-test probability of VTE.

### Multi-center human alert trial to prevent DVT and PE… [^b8d58619]. ClinicalTrials (2006). Low credibility.

At Brigham and Women's Hospital, we undertook a comprehensive program aimed at increasing the frequency of VTE prophylaxis in high risk patients. This novel strategy required: 1) devising a risk score that reliably and quickly identified patients at high risk of VTE, and 2) conducting a randomized controlled trial in which high risk patients without prophylaxis were randomized into an intervention or control group. 3 of the 8 risk factors were considered major and were assigned a score of 3 points each:

- Cancer
- Prior VTE
- Hypercoagulability One of the 8 risk factors, surgery, was considered intermediate and was assigned a score of 2. 4 of the 8 risk factors were considered minor and were assigned a score of 1 point each: The intervention group had an overall 41% reduction in VTE, without any increase in major bleeding. There was a 60% reduction in the incidence of symptomatic pulmonary embolism.

Identification of Patients at Risk for Venous Thromboembolism: A VTE risk profile will be computed for each hospitalized patient using 8 common risk factors. Each risk factor is weighted according to a point score. To be included in this trial, the point score must equal or exceed 4 points. Intermediate Risk Factor: · Major Surgery Major Risk Factors:

- Cancer
- Prior VTE
- Hypercoagulability. Increased VTE risk is defined as a cumulative VTE risk score 4, so that patients with at least 1 major risk factor plus at least 1 additional intermediate risk factor or minor risk factor become eligible. In the absence of a major risk factor, patients with 1 intermediate risk factor plus at least 2 minor risk factors become eligible.

Screening for Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis: If the cumulative VTE risk score is ≥ 4, orders are reviewed to detect ongoing mechanical or pharmacological prophylactic measures. Mechanical prophylactic measures include graduated compression stockings and intermittent pneumatic compression devices. Pharmacological prophylactic measures include unfractionated heparin, enoxaparin, dalteparin, fondaparinux, tinzaparin, and warfarin.

Remarks state that validated clinical decision rules were used to assess clinical probability of PE in studies, the Geneva score has been validated only in an outpatient population, if a 2-level clinical decision rule is used this recommendation corresponds to the "likely PE" category, and the strategy assumes optimal test conditions with suboptimal CTPA possibly requiring repeat testing.

### American Society of Hematology 2023 guidelines for management of venous thromboembolism: thrombophilia testing [^1db59f6b]. Blood Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

For patients with VTE provoked by surgery, the recommendation in this ASH guideline not to test for thrombophilia is consistent with those of others. Interestingly, the ASH Choosing Wisely guidance that aims to reduce inappropriate thrombophilia testing also states: "patients who experience VTE in the setting of a major transient risk factor but who have additional risk factors such as a positive family history or concurrent exposure to hormonal therapy, ASH recommends that such patients seek guidance from an expert in VTE", highlighting the need for the current guidelines.

For patients with VTE provoked by a nonsurgical major transient risk factor or VTE associated with COCs, HRT, pregnancy, or postpartum, the ASH guideline suggests testing patients for thrombophilia. These recommendations are new and may cause considerable discussion, as many currently view these VTE episodes as provoked and are generally inclined to use short-term anticoagulation for such patients. It is important to note, however, that most guidelines or guidance statements on thrombophilia testing do not distinguish between major and minor provoking risk factors, which current science suggests is appropriate. For example, the ASH VTE treatment guideline, which the thrombophilia panel has used to define clinical scenarios and standards of care, distinguishes between major and minor provoking risk factors for VTE. The role of thrombophilia in decisions to guide treatment duration was not discussed by that panel, as it was assigned to the ASH thrombophilia panel. The European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the diagnosis and management of acute PE developed in collaboration with the European Respiratory Society (ERS) (2019) also distinguish major and minor provoking risk factors for VTE to assess VTE recurrence risk and suggest "to test for high-risk thrombophilia (but not heterozygous FVL or PGM) in patients in whom VTE occurs at a young age (eg, aged < 50 years) and in the absence of an otherwise identifiable risk factor, especially when this occurs against the background of a strong family history of VTE, as these are often candidates for indefinite anticoagulant treatment after a first episode of PE occurring in the absence of a major reversible risk factor". In summary, the suggestions to consider thrombophilia testing in deciding on the duration of VTE treatment after a nonsurgical risk factor may appear counterintuitive to some, but in fact are in line with considerations mentioned in other guidelines or guidance statements. It has to be noted that, to our knowledge, the ASH recommendations are the first to have formally used a rigorous modeling approach to assess the effect of thrombophilia testing for patients with VTE provoked by a nonsurgical major transient risk factor, supporting with quantitative and comprehensive considerations the suggestion of testing and the consequent indefinite duration of anticoagulation for the patients found to be positive and therefore at higher risk.

### D-dimer for venous thromboembolism diagnosis: 20 years later [^50c931a8]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2008). Low credibility.

Twenty years after its first use in the diagnostic workup of suspected venous thromboembolism (VTE), fibrin D-dimer (DD) testing has gained wide acceptance for ruling out this disease. The test is particularly useful in the outpatient population referred to the emergency department because of suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE), in which the ruling out capacity concerns every third patient clinically suspected of having the disease. This usefulness is based on the high sensitivity of the test to the presence of VTE, at least for some assays. Due to its poor specificity precluding its use for ruling in VTE, DD testing must be integrated in comprehensive, sequential diagnostic strategies that include clinical probability assessment and imaging techniques such as lower limb venous compression ultrasonography for suspected DVT or multi-slice helical computed tomography for suspected PE. The present narrative review updates the data available on the use of the various commercially available DD assays in the diagnostic approach of clinically suspected VTE in distinct patient populations or situations, including outpatients and inpatients, patients with cancer, older age, pregnancy, a suspected recurrent event, limited thrombus burden, and patients already on anticoagulant treatment.

Acute pulmonary embolism — alternative initial testing when appropriate: Several alternative approaches to the work-up of PE may also be beneficial, including using lower-extremity venous ultrasonography before CT; in hemodynamically stable patients with lower-extremity symptoms, identifying deep venous thrombosis can eliminate the need to perform CT, and this approach has particular utility in pregnant patients in the first trimester with suspected PE, in whom the risks and benefits of CT should be weighed even more carefully. Although CT exposes these patients to less radiation than V/Q imaging does, it may have teratogenic effects, making the use of lower-extremity ultrasonography in patients with lower-extremity symptoms a valid strategy.

### Management of pulmonary embolism: an update [^3db75f8e]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a major contributor to global disease burden. Risk-adapted treatment and follow-up contributes to a favorable outcome. Age-adjusted cutoff levels increase D-dimer specificity and may decrease overuse of imaging procedures and overdiagnosis of PE. Primary systemic fibrinolysis has an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio in intermediate-risk PE; catheter-directed techniques are an option for patients with hemodynamic decompensation and high bleeding risk. New oral anticoagulant agents are effective and safe alternatives to standard anticoagulation regimens. Recent trial data do not support insertion of cava filters in patients who can receive anticoagulant treatments. Remaining areas of uncertainty include the therapeutic implications of subsegmental PE, the optimal diagnostic approach to the pregnant patient with suspected PE, and the efficacy and safety of new oral anticoagulant agents in patients with cancer. Campaigns to increase awareness combined with strategies to implement guideline recommendations will be crucial steps towards further optimizing management of acute PE.

Cancer screening

The overall incidence of a new cancer diagnosis is up to six-fold higher in patients with VTE than in sex- and age-matched controls. The absolute risk is highest during the first months after VTE diagnosis, in patients with unprovoked VTE, and in patients aged older than 50 years. The 1-year incidence of cancer is ∼1% in patients with provoked VTE compared to 5% in patients with unprovoked VTE, an incidence that gradually decreases to the risk of the general population over a 2-year period. Given these facts, we propose limited cancer screening in patients with unprovoked VTE to detect cancer at an early stage. Screening should include a thorough medical history, physical examination, basic laboratory testing (including a complete blood count, calcium, and liver function tests), and lung imaging (unless computed tomography [CT] pulmonary angiography was performed to diagnose PE). Age- and gender-specific testing (e.g. mammography, cervical smear, and prostate specific antigen testing) should be implemented in accordance with national guidelines and local practice. During follow-up after acute PE, the threshold to suspect cancer should be low in patients with a relatively recent history of cured cancer (e.g. within 5 years, as VTE can be a sign of recurrent cancer), early VTE progression/recurrence despite anticoagulant treatment, and anticoagulant-related bleeding shortly after start of treatment (particularly gastrointestinal bleeding or haematuria). If cancer is detected in the course of PE treatment, the choice and dosage of the anticoagulant as well as the duration of treatment should be adjusted accordingly.

Although (extensive) screening for cancer leads to an earlier cancer diagnosis, evidence that screening reduces cancer-related morbidity or mortality is lacking. Extensive imaging-based screening with chest CT imaging, abdominal CT imaging, and/or 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT imaging may further increase the number of cancers detected at VTE diagnosis but should be avoided, since the survival benefit of such an approach has never been demonstrated, and at the same time it carries the considerable costs and risks of invasive tests, false-positive findings, and overdiagnosis.

Description

Pulmonary embolism (PE) can be a severe disease and is difficult to diagnose, given its nonspecific signs and symptoms. Because of this, testing patients with suspected acute PE has increased dramatically. However, the overuse of some tests, particularly computed tomography (CT) and plasma d-dimer measurement, may not improve care while potentially leading to patient harm and unnecessary expense.

Methods

The literature search encompassed studies indexed by MEDLINE (1966–2014; English-language only) and included all clinical trials and meta-analyses on diagnostic strategies, decision rules, laboratory tests, and imaging studies for the diagnosis of PE. This document is not based on a formal systematic review, but instead seeks to provide practical advice based on the best available evidence and recent guidelines. The target audience for this paper is all clinicians; the target patient population is all adults, both inpatient and outpatient, suspected of having acute PE.

Best Practice Advice 1

Clinicians should use validated clinical prediction rules to estimate pretest probability in patients in whom acute PE is being considered.

Best Practice Advice 2

Clinicians should not obtain d-dimer measurements or imaging studies in patients with a low pretest probability of PE and who meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria.

Best Practice Advice 3

Clinicians should obtain a high-sensitivity d-dimer measurement as the initial diagnostic test in patients who have an intermediate pretest probability of PE or in patients with low pretest probability of PE who do not meet all Pulmonary Embolism Rule-Out Criteria. Clinicians should not use imaging studies as the initial test in patients who have a low or intermediate pretest probability of PE.

Best Practice Advice 4

Clinicians should use age-adjusted d-dimer thresholds (age × 10 ng/mL rather than a generic 500 ng/mL) in patients older than 50 years to determine whether imaging is warranted.

Best Practice Advice 5

Clinicians should not obtain any imaging studies in patients with a d-dimer level below the age-adjusted cutoff.

Best Practice Advice 6

Clinicians should obtain imaging with CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in patients with high pretest probability of PE. Clinicians should reserve ventilation-perfusion scans for patients who have a contraindication to CTPA or if CTPA is not available. Clinicians should not obtain a d-dimer measurement in patients with a high pretest probability of PE.

Implications for practice and research of these guidelines

Our work has several implications for practice and research. First, for the practicing clinician and for patients, our guideline suggests that shared decision making, covering the pros and cons and the practical implications of thrombophilia testing and the adoption of the associated VTE prevention strategies, may improve the quality of care for individuals with increased risk of clotting events, particularly so if they are at high risk of bleeding or have an indication or preference for hormonal therapy. Implementation of the guideline from this perspective will require educational tools and opportunities, which we strongly recommend being provided by scientific societies and patient organizations. Second, as pointed out many times in the guideline and for each recommendation, it is very critical that the proper thrombophilia tests are performed by high-quality clinical laboratories. Too often, thrombophilia testing includes tests with no supportive evidence, and too often the laboratory results are reported with insufficient details or interpretation. Training of physicians and laboratory medicine clinicians will be required for a positive impact of the proposed recommendations. Third, as the guidelines suggest against thrombophilia testing in many clinical scenarios, overdiagnosis may be decreased. Finally, more research is urgently needed. In particular, large implementation studies comparing the impact, in terms of outcome rates, among management strategies involving or not involving thrombophilia testing. This is a typical field where academically initiated guideline implementation studies might be warranted, as it is unlikely that this research will be sponsored by drug manufacturers because personalized medicine approaches often restrict the indication to pharmacological treatment. However, large organizations such as ASH might facilitate networks of independent researchers accessing public research funds to answer these burning questions.

The authors summarize the current knowledge in the area of novel risk factors for venous thrombosis, both genetic and acquired causes of hypercoagulability. Because the list of genetic defects that predispose carriers to develop thrombosis has increased significantly in recent years, along with the available assays to test for them, hypercoagulability has been a subject of much discussion. This review highlights the issues on hypercoagulability that pathologists who are not specialists in coagulation should be familiar with, in order to provide consultation to other physicians. An educated approach to the diagnosis of this newly described group of disorders will ensure more cost-effective and efficient care to patients at risk.

Recurrent pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosis — hemodynamically stable, nonpregnant patients: If the D-dimer strategy is followed, a highly sensitive D-dimer assay is required, and a negative D-dimer rules out PE and no additional testing or anticoagulation is required. D-dimer has limited utility in hospitalized patients and in certain patient populations (postsurgical, pregnancy) due to the high frequency of positive D-dimer results with standard thresholds, and there are limited data on the utility of D-dimer for patients receiving anticoagulation therapy who present with suspected recurrent PE. The strategy assumes that test results are obtained under optimal conditions and suboptimal CTPA results may require repeat testing, and if prior imaging is available, comparison of the previous and current imaging is warranted to determine whether the findings are new and represent recurrent PE. Scores were used to assess clinical probability of recurrent PE, but the Wells and Geneva scores have not been specifically validated for patients with suspected recurrent PE.

Modern diagnostic strategies for VTE incorporate PTP assessment, and the ability of diagnostic tests to correctly identify or exclude VTE is influenced by PTP, prevalence and test accuracy characteristics. For patients at low (unlikely) VTE risk, using D-dimer as the initial test reduces the need for diagnostic imaging, whereas for patients at high (likely) VTE risk, imaging is warranted. For PE diagnosis, ventilation-perfusion scanning and computed tomography pulmonary angiography are the most validated tests, whereas lower or upper extremity DVT diagnosis uses ultrasonography.

Approximately 20% of all patients were tested for inherited thrombophilia, and not surprisingly, clinical characteristics and VTE risk factors differed markedly between tested and untested patients with VTE. Testing for inherited thrombophilia was done more frequently in younger patients, patients with VTE provoked by estrogen use, pregnancy or postpartum, unprovoked VTE, and prior VTE, and less commonly in those with immobilization (≥ 4 days) and major risk factors such as surgery or active cancer, a pattern that has been recognized over the past decades.

The American Society of Hematology (ASH) formed a multidisciplinary panel including patient representatives. The McMaster University GRADE Centre completed systematic reviews up to 1 October 2017. The panel prioritized questions and outcomes and used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess evidence and make recommendations. Test accuracy estimates and VTE population prevalence were used to model expected outcomes in diagnostic pathways. Where modeling was not feasible, management and accuracy studies were used to formulate recommendations.

Results

Ten recommendations are presented, by PTP for patients with suspected PE and lower extremity DVT, and for recurrent VTE and upper extremity DVT.

Conclusions

For patients at low (unlikely) VTE risk, using D-dimer as the initial test reduces the need for diagnostic imaging. For patients at high (likely) VTE risk, imaging is warranted. For PE diagnosis, ventilation-perfusion scanning and computed tomography pulmonary angiography are the most validated tests, whereas lower or upper extremity DVT diagnosis uses ultrasonography. Research is needed on new diagnostic modalities and to validate clinical decision rules for patients with suspected recurrent VTE.

### 2019 ESC guidelines for the diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism developed in collaboration with the European Respiratory Society (ERS): the task force for the diagnosis and management of acute pulmonary embolism of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) [^53309105]. The European Respiratory Journal (2019). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for pulmonary embolism, more specifically with respect to follow-up, ESC 2019 guidelines recommend to obtain regular reassessments of drug tolerance and adherence, hepatic and renal function, and the bleeding risk in patients receiving extended anticoagulation.

### An official American Thoracic Society / Society of Thoracic Radiology clinical practice guideline: evaluation of suspected pulmonary embolism in pregnancy [^84468620]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Medium credibility.

Suspected pulmonary embolism in pregnancy — D-dimer testing guidance is stated as follows: Based upon this sparse and indirect evidence, which included reports of false negative d-dimers in pregnant women with documented PE, panel members judged that D-dimer cannot currently be used to exclude suspected PE in pregnancy, and consideration of the additional cost and delay to diagnosis imposed by this test resulted in a weak recommendation not to include it in the diagnostic algorithm.

### Pulmonary embolism [^af6d5f19]. Lancet (2004). Excellent credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common illness that can cause death and disability. It is difficult to detect because patients present with a wide array of symptoms and signs. The clinical setting can raise suspicion, and certain inherited and acquired risk factors predispose susceptible individuals. D-dimer concentration in blood is the best laboratory screening test, and chest CT has become the most widespread imaging test. Treatment requires rapid and accurate risk stratification before haemodynamic decompensation and the development of cardiogenic shock. Anticoagulation is the foundation of therapy. Right-ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography and higher than normal concentrations of troponin identify high-risk patients who might need escalation of therapy with thrombolysis or embolectomy even if the blood pressure is normal on presentation. When patients are admitted to medical wards or when patients undergo surgery, their physicians should prescribe prophylactic measures to prevent PE. After hospital discharge, prophylaxis should continue for about a month for patients at high risk of thromboembolism.

PE is one of the great challenges in medicine. It is a disease that carries with it a high mortality rate, yet no historical piece of information, physical examination finding, or diagnostic modality is perfect at excluding its possibility. Emergency physicians must be vigilant about considering PE in the differential diagnosis of a variety of presenting complaints and must use a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic options as they manage patients with suspected or confirmed PE. The diagnostic options range from bedside diagnostic tests to highly specialized imaging available at only specialized institutions. Knowing the advantages and disadvantages of each of the diagnostic modalities assists the physician in employing the best test. Therapeutic options also vary widely and include anticoagulation, vena caval interruption, systemic thrombolysis, embolectomy, and other therapeutic adjuncts, such as ECMO and inhaled nitric oxide. Similarly, awareness of the indications and contraindications to the varied therapeutic agents ensures appropriate therapy when the diagnosis is made.

### Venous thromboembolism laboratory testing (factor V Leiden and factor II C. ∗ 97G > A), 2025 revision: a technical standard of the American College of Medical Genetics and genomics (ACMG) [^c75e65ad]. Genetics in Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) epidemiology — The incidence of VTE is approximately 1 to 1.5 per 1000 persons per year, and an individual's absolute lifetime risk is approximately 11%. Risk is age related, being approximately 1 in 10,000 persons per year before age 40 and increasing to 1 in 1000 persons per year after age 75. The clinical management of VTE costs the health care system an estimated $1.5 billion each year in the United States. The recurrence risk is approximately 20% within 5 years and 30% within 10 years after the first incidence, and it is estimated that one-third of VTE manifests as pulmonary embolism and two-thirds as other deep vein thromboses (DVTs).
