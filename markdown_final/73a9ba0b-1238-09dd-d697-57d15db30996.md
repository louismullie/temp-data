## Question

56-year-old woman with alcoholic cirrhosis one month after TIPS presents with a week of confusion, irritability, sleep disturbances, constipation, asterixis, and slowed number connection test; exam shows stigmata of chronic liver disease and ascites.

A 56-year-old woman is brought to the emergency department by her husband because of increasing confusion, generalized fatigue, and irritability for the past week. She has been unable to recall her husband's name or their address. She has had insomnia and daytime sleepiness during this period. Her last bowel movement was 3 days ago. One month ago, she underwent a transjugular intrahepatic portal shunt (TIPS) placement. She has alcoholic liver cirrhosis. Current medications include spironolactone and furosemide. She used to drink over a pint of vodka daily but quit 2 months ago. She is oriented to place and person. Her temperature is 37.3°C (99.1°F), pulse is 88/min, and blood pressure is 102/64 mm Hg. Examination shows scleral icterus and jaundice. There are several telangiectasias over the chest and back. Palmar erythema is present. The abdomen is mildly distended and nontender. Shifting dullness is present. There is a flapping tremor of both hands when outstretched and dorsiflexed. Neurologic examination shows no other focal findings. She completes the number connection test slower than the age-normalized standard. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?

Answer Choices:
A. Reversal of TIPS
B. Paracentesis
C. Administer IV ceftriaxone
D. Administer lactulose

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which management step is most appropriate for a 56-year-old woman with alcoholic cirrhosis and recent TIPS who now presents with overt hepatic encephalopathy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and severity of hepatic encephalopathy. Then, I should verify the likely precipitating factors, especially the role of TIPS and constipation. Next, I will review guideline-based first-line therapy for overt HE. After that, I need to consider the timing and indications for more invasive options like TIPS reversal. Finally, I will evaluate the competing choices (paracentesis, ceftriaxone) and decide on the best immediate action with supporting references.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity. The patient has disorientation, confusion, sleep disturbance, asterixis, and impaired number connection testing, which together meet criteria for overt hepatic encephalopathy using the West Haven classification, and this is exactly the framework recommended for post-TIPS follow-up and HE assessment by EASL guidance, so I should classify this as overt HE rather than covert HE [^796f1efc] [^618dbaa4].

> Wait, let me verify the precipitating factors. TIPS increases the risk of post-procedural encephalopathy by diverting portal flow and reducing hepatic clearance of ammonia and other neurotoxins, and constipation further worsens ammonia absorption; constipation is a recognized precipitant of HE, and the timing one month post-TIPS fits the known risk window for new or worsening HE, so both TIPS physiology and constipation are plausible contributors here [^44ed1bce] [^cadf657e].

> I need to check the first-line management for overt HE. Guidelines consistently recommend initiating lactulose to reduce ammonia absorption via acidification and catharsis, with a typical goal of 2–3 soft stools per day; this is standard in cirrhosis care pathways and is the immediate, noninvasive therapy that can reverse HE in many patients, so lactulose is the most appropriate next step right now [^cadf657e] [^c78373f8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about TIPS reversal. Shunt modification or reversal is reserved for severe, refractory, or life-threatening encephalopathy that fails maximal medical therapy, not for initial management of overt HE; I should confirm that we escalate to reversal only if symptoms persist despite optimized lactulose and, when indicated, rifaximin, so choosing reversal now would be premature [^44ed1bce] [^54f4c3e0].

> Let me consider paracentesis. Diagnostic paracentesis is indicated for new-onset ascites or when patients are admitted with ascites-related symptoms or encephalopathy, but it is a diagnostic step and does not treat HE itself; it won't address ammonia load or neurocognitive symptoms, so it is not the most appropriate next therapeutic step for this HE presentation [^deef24e5].

> I should double-check the role of ceftriaxone. Empiric antibiotics are indicated when there is concern for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or infection as a precipitant of HE, but there is no mention of fever, abdominal pain, leukocytosis, or SBP risk features here; thus, ceftriaxone would not be indicated as the initial step in this scenario without evidence of infection [^c78373f8].

> Let me synthesize and confirm the plan. The most appropriate next step is to administer lactulose to promptly reduce ammonia absorption and reverse overt HE, while concurrently addressing constipation and monitoring for improvement; if HE recurs or remains refractory despite optimized medical therapy, then consideration of TIPS revision or reversal becomes reasonable, but that is not the immediate next step today [^cadf657e] [^44ed1bce].

---

The most appropriate next step is to **administer lactulose** [^cadf657e] because the patient presents with overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE) [^796f1efc] following TIPS, and lactulose is first-line therapy to reduce ammonia absorption and improve mental status [^c78373f8]. TIPS reversal is reserved for refractory cases, paracentesis is not indicated without new ascites or infection, and ceftriaxone is only used if infection is suspected [^deef24e5].

---

## Clinical reasoning and evidence

### Diagnosis and severity assessment

The patient's confusion, asterixis, and slowed number connection test indicate **overt HE** [^796f1efc] by West Haven criteria [^618dbaa4]. TIPS increases HE risk by diverting portal flow and reducing hepatic clearance of ammonia and other toxins [^44ed1bce].

---

### First-line management of hepatic encephalopathy

Lactulose is the **first-line therapy** [^cadf657e] for overt HE: it acidifies the colon, converts ammonia to ammonium, and reduces absorption, thereby improving mental status [^c78373f8]. Typical dosing is 10–20 g orally three times daily, titrated to 2–3 soft stools per day [^cadf657e].

---

### Alternative options and their appropriateness

- **TIPS reversal**: Reserved for severe, refractory HE despite maximal medical therapy; not first-line [^44ed1bce].
- **Paracentesis**: Indicated for new ascites or suspected infection; not for isolated HE without new ascites [^deef24e5].
- **Ceftriaxone**: Used for suspected or confirmed infection (e.g. SBP); no infection signs here [^notfound].

---

### Conclusion and recommendation

The most appropriate next step is to **administer lactulose** [^cadf657e] to promptly treat overt HE, with close monitoring and escalation only if refractory [^c78373f8].

---

The correct answer is **D. Administer lactulose**.

A Practical Approach to the Diagnosis and Management of Hepatic Encephalopathy] Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common complication of decompensated cirrhosis that can be reversed with treatment. Frequent episodes of recurrence are common, impacting patients, caregivers and healthcare systems, increasing morbidity and mortality statistics and resulting in grave financial consequences. Uptake and adherence to formal recommendations for HE diagnosis and management are low. There is an unmet need to advocate for the use of these recommendations in a more pragmatic form. Clinicians from multiple disciplines, dedicated to raising liver disease awareness, convened in a roundtable format to review and discuss the latest HE guidelines and relevant peer-reviewed literature on HE. The result was this clinical care publication on the screening, diagnosis and management of HE which seeks to facilitate clinicians' recognition and diagnosis of HE, apply a pathway of care for HE that addresses steps for initial management, long-term maintenance and prevention; it also addresses practical recommendations concerning situations encountered in HE. Resources are provided to address the different needs of the three key players in HE: patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals.

### Alosetron [^f2ba3312]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Starting dose is 0.5 mg twice a day (2.1)
May increase dose to 1 mg twice a day after 4 weeks if starting dosage is well tolerated but does not adequately control IBS symptoms (2.1)
Discontinue alosetron tablets in patients who have not had adequate control of IBS symptoms after 4 weeks of treatment with 1 mg twice a day. (2.1)

2.1 Adult Patients

To lower the risk of constipation, alosetron tablets should be started at a dosage of 0.5 mg twice a day. Patients who become constipated at this dosage should stop taking alosetron tablets until the constipation resolves. They may be restarted at 0.5 mg once a day. If constipation recurs at the lower dose, Alosetron tablets should be discontinued immediately.

Patients well controlled on 0.5 mg once or twice a day may be maintained on this regimen. If after 4 weeks the dosage is well tolerated but does not adequately control IBS symptoms, then the dosage can be increased to up to 1 mg twice a day. Alosetron tablets should be discontinued in patients who have not had adequate control of IBS symptoms after 4 weeks of treatment with 1 mg twice a day.

Alosetron tablets can be taken with or without food [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

Alosetron tablets should be discontinued immediately in patients who develop constipation or signs of ischemic colitis. Alosetron tablets should not be restarted in patients who develop ischemic colitis.

Clinical trial and postmarketing experience suggest that debilitated patients or patients taking additional medications that decrease gastrointestinal motility may be at greater risk of serious complications of constipation. Therefore, appropriate caution and follow-up should be exercised if alosetron tablets are prescribed for these patients.

Postmarketing experience suggests that elderly patients may be at greater risk for complications of constipation; therefore, appropriate caution and follow-up should be exercised if alosetron tablets are prescribed for these patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

2.2 Patients with Hepatic Impairment

Alosetron tablets are extensively metabolized by the liver, and increased exposure to alosetron tablets is likely to occur in patients with hepatic impairment. Increased drug exposure may increase the risk of serious adverse reactions. Alosetron tablets should be used with caution in patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment and is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment [see Contraindications (4), Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

### Cat hair (standardized cat hair) [^4fa53fa3]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

Diagnosis: Concentrated extract (10,000 BAU/mL) may be used for scratch or prick-puncture testing. Puncture tests performed with a bifurcated needle in ten cat allergic persons showed a mean wheal diameter of 6.6 mm (S.D. 1.3) with a mean sum of erythema of 57.3 mm (S.D. 10.4).

Intradermal tests with serial three-fold dilution of the 10,000 BAU/mL showed the following results:

The mean three-fold dilution eliciting a response of 50 mm sum of erythema diameters was 11.120 (S.D. 2,38). The number of BAU/mL required to elicit this response was 0.05 (range 0.0003 to 9.24 BAU/mL). This concentration is approximately a 1:200,000 v/v dilution of the 10,000 BAU/mL extract.

Extract for intradermal testing should be used as follows:

Patients with a positive scratch or prick test to Standardized Cat Hair Extract. It is not advisable to perform an intradermal skin test in these patients.
Patients with a negative scratch or prick test to Standardized Cat Hair Extract. Patients who do not react to a scratch or prick test with the 10,000 BAU/mL concentrate maybe tested intradermally with 0.05 mL of a 1:2,000 v/v dilution of the concentrate (5 BAU/mL). If the test is negative, a second test should be performed with 0.05 mL of a 1:200 v/v dilution of concentrate (50 BAU/mL).
Patients tested only by the intradermal method with Standardized Cat Hair Extract. Patients suspected of being highly allergic to cats should be tested with 0.05 mL of a 1:200,000 v/v dilution (0.05 BAU/mL) of the concentrate. A negative test should be followed by repeat tests using 10 fold stronger concentrations until the maximum dose of 0.05 mL of a 1:200 v/v dilution (50 BAU/mL) is reached.

### Daptomycin in sodium chloride [^1ca720e5]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Upon entry, patients were classified for likelihood of endocarditis using the modified Duke criteria (Possible, Definite, or Not Endocarditis). Echocardiography, including a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), was performed within 5 days following study enrollment. The choice of comparator agent was based on the oxacillin susceptibility of the S. aureus isolate. The duration of study treatment was based on the investigator's clinical diagnosis. Final diagnoses and outcome assessments at Test of Cure (6 weeks after the last treatment dose) were made by a treatment-blinded Adjudication Committee, using protocol-specified clinical definitions and a composite primary efficacy endpoint (clinical and microbiological success) at the Test of Cure visit.

A total of 246 patients ≥ 18 years of age (124 daptomycin for injection, 122 comparator) with S. aureus bacteremia were randomized from 48 centers in the US and Europe. In the ITT population, 120 patients received daptomycin for injection and 115 received comparator (62 received an anti-staphylococcal semi-synthetic penicillin and 53 received vancomycin). Thirty-five patients treated with an anti-staphylococcal semi-synthetic penicillin received vancomycin initially for 1 to 3 days, pending final susceptibility results for the S. aureus isolates. The median age among the 235 patients in the ITT population was 53 years (range: 21 to 91 years); 30/120 (25%) in the daptomycin for injection group and 37/115 (32%) in the comparator group were ≥ 65 years of age. Of the 235 ITT patients, there were 141 (60%) males and 156 (66%) Caucasians across the two treatment groups. In addition, 176 (75%) of the ITT population had systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) at baseline and 85 (36%) had surgical procedures within 30 days prior to onset of the S. aureus bacteremia. Eighty-nine patients (38%) had bacteremia caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Entry diagnosis was based on the modified Duke criteria and comprised 37 (16%) Definite, 144 (61%) Possible, and 54 (23%) Not Endocarditis. Of the 37 patients with an entry diagnosis of Definite Endocarditis, all (100%) had a final diagnosis of infective endocarditis, and of the 144 patients with an entry diagnosis of Possible Endocarditis, 15 (10%) had a final diagnosis of infective endocarditis as assessed by the Adjudication Committee. Of the 54 patients with an entry diagnosis of Not Endocarditis, 1 (2%) had a final diagnosis of infective endocarditis as assessed by the Adjudication Committee.

A total of 246 patients ≥ 18 years of age (124 CUBICIN, 122 comparator) with S. aureus bacteremia were randomized from 48 centers in the US and Europe. In the ITT population, 120 patients received CUBICIN and 115 received comparator (62 received an anti-staphylococcal semi-synthetic penicillin and 53 received vancomycin). Thirty-five patients treated with an anti-staphylococcal semi-synthetic penicillin received vancomycin initially for 1 to 3 days, pending final susceptibility results for the S. aureus isolates. The median age among the 235 patients in the ITT population was 53 years (range: 21 to 91 years); 30/120 (25%) in the CUBICIN group and 37/115 (32%) in the comparator group were ≥ 65 years of age. Of the 235 ITT patients, there were 141 (60%) males and 156 (66%) Caucasians across the two treatment groups. In addition, 176 (75%) of the ITT population had systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) at baseline and 85 (36%) had surgical procedures within 30 days prior to onset of the S. aureus bacteremia. Eighty-nine patients (38%) had bacteremia caused by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Entry diagnosis was based on the modified Duke criteria and comprised 37 (16%) Definite, 144 (61%) Possible, and 54 (23%) Not Endocarditis. Of the 37 patients with an entry diagnosis of Definite Endocarditis, all (100%) had a final diagnosis of infective endocarditis, and of the 144 patients with an entry diagnosis of Possible Endocarditis, 15 (10%) had a final diagnosis of infective endocarditis as assessed by the Adjudication Committee. Of the 54 patients with an entry diagnosis of Not Endocarditis, 1 (2%) had a final diagnosis of infective endocarditis as assessed by the Adjudication Committee.

### Right versus middle hepatic vein access and one-year TIPS outcomes [^54f4c3e0]. CVIR Endovascular (2025). Medium credibility.

Clinical outcomes

The primary outcome was shunt patency and one-year survival. Secondary outcomes were revision-free survival, efficacy of controlling gastrointestinal bleeding & fluid overload, and rate of new onset post-procedural HE.

In our study, post-TIPS HE was assessed using a novel classification system that stratifies patients based on the degree of intervention required. This grading system is as follows: 'None' for patients exhibiting no symptoms of HE; 'Mild' for cases necessitating the initiation of new pharmacologic therapy such as lactulose, rifaximin, or zinc – choice of medication was not standardized and was administered based on clinical judgement of the treating hepatologist, but was started at the first sign of altered mental status; 'Moderate' for patients requiring hospitalization in a non-ICU setting due to HE symptoms; and 'Severe' for cases where ICU admission or shunt reversal was warranted.

This customized stratification was chosen over the conventional West Haven classification system to provide a more clinically actionable framework. While the West Haven system remains a validated tool for HE severity assessment, our approach directly correlates HE severity with clinical resource utilization. By focusing on the therapeutic and hospitalization needs, this system aligns with the practical considerations encountered in managing post-TIPS complications.

Clinical indications for TIPS placement included refractory fluid overload from hydrothorax or ascites that was not responsive to sodium restriction or diuretics necessitating recurrent thoracentesis or paracentesis. In addition, patients with refractory gastrointestinal bleeding requiring blood transfusions or repeated endoscopy were eligible for TIPS placement. Efficacy post-TIPS was categorized based on their management requirements after TIPS placement: absent, manageable without interventions (no thoracentesis, paracentesis, or transfusions required), manageable with sparing treatments, or refractory to standard treatments.

### ONS / ASCO guideline on the management of antineoplastic extravasation [^042c185c]. JCO Oncology Practice (2025). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for extravasation of antineoplastic agents, more specifically with respect to indications for referral, ASCO/ONS 2025 guidelines recommend to consider performing a surgical referral or escalation of care for patients with central line extravasation of irritants with vesicant properties or vesicant antineoplastic agents, in addition to conservative management, rather than conservative management alone.

- recognize that high-risk populations, such as patients receiving DNA-binding vesicants, those with high-volume estimated extravasation, and those with National Cancer Institute CTCAE grade 2 (erythema associated with symptoms such as edema, pain, induration, and phlebitis), grade 3 (ulceration or necrosis; severe tissue damage), or grade 4 (life-threatening consequences) extravasation, may have a greater likelihood of benefiting from surgical referral or escalation in care.

### GRADE certainty ratings: thresholds rather than categories of contextualization (GRADE guidance 41) [^1494ffa4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

In 2017, the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) working group defined the certainty of evidence as the certainty that the true effect lies on one side of a threshold or in a particular range. This definition has proved useful as the basis for rating certainty, facilitating the interpretation of the results for the target audience. However, the categorization of suggested thresholds and ranges as levels of contextualization led to inconsistencies between the initial and subsequent papers and has proved confusing for some GRADE users.

Although considering context in choosing thresholds remains worthwhile, the GRADE working group will no longer use the categorization of contextualization. It will instead refer simply to chosen thresholds or ranges for determining the target of certainty rating.

### Mothers' reflections on the diagnosis and birth of their child with down syndrome: variability based on the timing of the diagnosis [^44d0c200]. Journal of Genetic Counseling (2025). Medium credibility.

The aforementioned effects were replicated in the language and feeling states data. Although group differences were not found in cognition term use, the postnatal diagnosis group used more emotion terms when discussing the diagnosis event relative to the birth event, a finding that was not apparent for mothers who received a prenatal diagnosis. Mothers who received a prenatal diagnosis, however, used more emotion terms when discussing their child's birth relative to mothers who received a postnatal diagnosis. When considering feeling states terms, group differences were not found for the diagnosis event. For the birth event, the prenatal group reported more positive than negative feelings, an effect that was not found for the postnatal group. The prenatal group also reported more positive and fewer negative feelings about the birth event relative to mothers who received a postnatal diagnosis.

The unique patterns of effects observed by group when considering emotion and feeling states terms suggests that the participants processed the birth event differently. Although future work is needed, it is possible that these differences result from between‐group variability in the timing of the diagnosis event in relation to the birth experience. That is, mothers who learned of their child's diagnosis during pregnancy not only had more time to process and reflect on the diagnosis relative to mothers who received a postnatal diagnosis, but the diagnosis event was more temporally distant from the birth for the former group relative to the latter. As such, for the prenatal diagnosis group, the negative, emotionally arousing information about the child's diagnosis was temporally separate from the positive, emotionally arousing information about the child's birth, whereas these two events happened in close proximity for the postnatal group. The impact of the timing of the diagnosis is apparent when considering the significance of the events: mothers who received a postnatal diagnosis rated their child's diagnosis as more significant at the time of its occurrence relative to at the time of the study, an effect that was not apparent for mothers who received a prenatal diagnosis; mothers who received a prenatal diagnosis rated the birth event as more significant at the time of the study relative to the postnatal diagnosis group. Although previous work has indicated that mothers prefer to receive news of a potential DS diagnosis even before confirmation is available (for relevant work, see Cunningham & Sloper; Gayton & Walker; Pueschel; Schimmel et al; Skotko et al.), more nuanced research is needed to better understand how variability in the timing of the diagnosis is associated with maternal reflections on the diagnosis and birth of their child with DS.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of ESBRIET was evaluated in patients with IPF in three phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trials (Studies 1, 2, and 3).

Study 1 was a 52-week trial comparing ESBRIET 2403 mg/day (n = 278) versus placebo (n = 277) in patients with IPF. Study 2 and Study 3 were nearly identical to each other in design, with few exceptions, including an intermediate dose treatment arm in Study 2. Study 2 compared treatment with either ESBRIET 2403 mg/day (n = 174) or ESBRIET 1197 mg/day (n = 87) to placebo (n = 174), while Study 3 compared ESBRIET 2403 mg/day (n = 171) to placebo (n = 173). Study drug was administered three times daily with food for a minimum of 72 weeks. Patients continued on treatment until the last patient completed 72 weeks of treatment, which included observations to approximately 120 weeks of study treatment. The primary endpoint was the change in percent predicted forced vital capacity (%FVC) from baseline to study end, measured at 52 weeks in Study 1, and at 72 weeks in Studies 2 and 3.

Studies 1, 2 and 3 enrolled adult patients who had a clinical and radiographic diagnosis of IPF (with or without accompanying surgical lung biopsy), without evidence or suspicion of an alternative diagnosis for interstitial lung disease. Eligible patients were to have %FVC greater than or equal to 50% at baseline and a percent predicted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (%DLCO) greater than or equal to 30% (Study 1) or 35% (Studies 2 and 3) at baseline. In all three trials, over 80% of patients completed study treatment.

A total of 1247 patients with IPF were randomized to receive ESBRIET 2403 mg/day (n = 623) or placebo (n = 624) in these three trials. Baseline characteristics were generally balanced across treatment groups. The study population ranged from 40 to 80 years of age (mean age 67 years). Most patients were male (74%), white (95%), and current or former smokers (65%). Approximately 93% of patients met criteria for definite IPF on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT). Baseline mean %FVC and %DLCOwere 72% and 46%, respectively. Approximately 15% subjects discontinued from each treatment group.

### Analysis of independent risk factors for hepatic encephalopathy after transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt in patients with cirrhosis combined with diabetes [^618dbaa4]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Diagnostic criteria

The study included patients who had been previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes based on the 1999 World Health Organization criteria. Furthermore, the diagnosis was predicated on the presence of hyperglycemia symptoms, a fasting blood glucose level of at least 7.0 mmol/l, and a casual blood glucose level of at least 11.1 mmol/l. Patients using insulin injections or traditional oral hypoglycemic drugs were also classified as people with diabetes.

According to the severity, covert HE is referred to as minor or no symptoms but abnormal neuropsychological or neurophysiological examinations. OHE includes grade II and higher grades according to the West Haven criteria, distinguished by disorientation, somnolence, and a coma-like state.

Ascites graded with reference to the International Ascites Club grading, Grade 1 ascites is mild ascites only detectable by ultrasound examination. Grade 2 ascites or moderate ascites is manifest by moderate symmetrical distension of abdomen. Grade 3 ascites is large or gross ascites with marked abdominal distension.

Follow-up

Patients are scheduled for follow-up visits every 3–6 months after TIPS. Each visit included a systematic examination of clinical signs and symptoms. Routine blood, coagulation, and liver function tests are also required, and regular review is requested. Ultrasound or computed tomography scans were used when necessary. A skilled hepatologist documents pertinent information and assesses the patient's symptoms and signs. During follow-up, signs and symptoms including mental and neurological abnormalities were used to identify OHE. Time to follow-up was defined as the interval from admission to death or the last visit or end of study (1 September 2023). The primary endpoint was OHE after TIPS creation.

### Pembrolizumab (Keytruda) [^f6ea25d1]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Treatment continued until RECIST v1.1-defined disease recurrence as determined by the investigator, unacceptable toxicity or up to one year. Tumor assessments were conducted every 12 weeks for the first year, then every 6 months for years 2 to 3, and then annually through year 5. After year 5, imaging was performed as per local standard of care. The major efficacy outcome measure was investigator-assessed disease-free survival (DFS). An additional efficacy outcome measure was OS.

Of 1177 patients randomized, 1010 (86%) received adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy following resection. Among these 1010 patients, the median age was 64 years (range: 35 to 84), 49% age 65 or older; 68% male; 77% White, 18% Asian; 86% current or former smokers; and 39% with ECOG PS of 1. Eleven percent had Stage IB, 57% had Stage II, and 31% had Stage IIIA disease. Thirty-nine percent had PD-L1 TPS < 1% [negative], 33% had TPS 1–49%, and 28% had TPS ≥ 50%. Fifty-two percent were from Western Europe, 20% from Eastern Europe, 17% from Asia, and 11% from Rest of World.

The trial met its primary endpoint, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in DFS in the overall population for patients randomized to the KEYTRUDA arm compared to patients randomized to the placebo arm. In an exploratory subgroup analysis of the 167 patients (14%) who did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy, the DFS HR was 1.25 (95% CI: 0.76, 2.05). OS results were not mature with only 42% of pre-specified OS events in the overall population.

Case presentation

We present a case of a 75-year-old White woman admitted for cough and dyspnea. The cough was non-productive and not associated with fever or chest pain. Her dyspnea was constant, worsening with activity and when lying supine. Both symptoms were present for 2 months, with significant exacerbation 48 h prior to admission.

Her medical history was significant for class I obesity, insulin-dependent type II diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cirrhosis secondary to Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease, with a Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) sodium score of 25 (14%–15% estimated 90-day mortality). She was a lifelong non-smoker and reported no alcohol or illicit drug use. Her prescribed medications included atorvastatin, carvedilol, rifaximin, lactulose, and both short- and long-acting insulin. The patient had multiple cirrhosis-related complications, including hepatic encephalopathy, esophageal varices with prior bleeding, thrombocytopenia, ascites, portal hypertensive gastropathy, and portal vein thrombosis. She had a history of intolerance to anticoagulation with enoxaparin due to recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding. Diuretics had been discontinued due to recurrent hyponatremia and associated acute kidney injury. Although her ascites was effectively managed through serial paracentesis, this did not result in a corresponding improvement in her HH.

Six months prior to this admission, the patient was diagnosed with recurrent HH, confirmed by a transudative right-sided pleural effusion and technetium-99 sulfur colloid imaging. She underwent multiple therapeutic interventions, including repeated thoracentesis, IPC placement (PleurX — Becton; Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA), and ultimately chemical talc pleurodesis. However, these measures failed to achieve long-term control of her large, recurrent right-sided HH. Consideration was given to TIPS placement and referral for LT; however, the patient declined both options, expressing a desire to focus on palliative medical management. Prior to admission, she continued to experience excessive fluid output through the persistent fistula in the right chest wall, which had failed to heal following IPC removal done prior to the talc pleurodesis. This fluid was normally collected and volume monitored by an external ostomy bag attached to the thoracic defect site.

### Triazolam [^59f91090]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

WARNING: RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDS; ABUSE, MISUSE, AND ADDICTION; and DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS

Concomitant use of benzodiazepines and opioids may result in profound sedation, respiratory depression, coma, and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs in patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Drug Interactions (7.1)].
The use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, exposes users to risks of abuse, misuse, and addiction, which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications, alcohol, and/or illicit substances, which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing triazolam and throughout treatment, assess each patient's risk for abuse, misuse, and addiction [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].
The continued use of benzodiazepines, including triazolam, may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of triazolam after continued use may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions, which can be life-threatening. To reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions, use a gradual taper to discontinue triazolam or reduce the dosage [see Dosage and Administration (2.3), Warnings and Precautions (5.3)].

### Oxycodone hydrochloride (Oxaydo) [^593b7826]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.7 Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia and Allodynia

Opioid-Induced Hyperalgesia (OIH) occurs when an opioid analgesic paradoxically causes an increase in pain, or an increase in sensitivity to pain. This condition differs from tolerance, which is the need for increasing doses of opioids to maintain a defined effect [see Dependence (9.3)]. Symptoms of OIH include (but may not be limited to) increased levels of pain upon opioid dosage increase, decreased levels of pain upon opioid dosage decrease, or pain from ordinarily non-painful stimuli (allodynia). These symptoms may suggest OIH only if there is no evidence of underlying disease progression, opioid tolerance, opioid withdrawal, or addictive behavior.

Cases of OIH have been reported, both with short-term and longer-term use of opioid analgesics. Though the mechanism of OIH is not fully understood, multiple biochemical pathways have been implicated. Medical literature suggests a strong biologic plausibility between opioid analgesics and OIH and allodynia. If a patient is suspected to be experiencing OIH, carefully consider appropriately decreasing the dose of the current opioid analgesic or opioid rotation (safely switching the patient to a different opioid moiety) [see Dosage and Administration (2.5), Warnings and Precautions (5.14)].

5.8 Life-Threatening Respiratory Depression in Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease or in Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients

The use of OXAYDO in patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma in an unmonitored setting or in the absence of resuscitative equipment is contraindicated.

Patients with Chronic Pulmonary Disease: OXAYDO-treated patients with significant chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cor pulmonale, and those with a substantially decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, hypercapnia, or pre-existing respiratory depression are at increased risk of decreased respiratory drive including apnea, even at recommended dosages of OXAYDO [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Elderly, Cachectic, or Debilitated Patients: Life-threatening respiratory depression is more likely to occur in elderly, cachectic, or debilitated patients because they may have altered pharmacokinetics or altered clearance compared to younger, healthier patients [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2)].

Regularly evaluate patients, particularly when initiating and titrating OXAYDO and when OXAYDO is given concomitantly with other drugs that depress respiration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)].

Alternatively, consider the use of non-opioid analgesics in these patients.

24% of patients with a delayed diagnosis had a CV-related ER visit compared with 14% without a delayed diagnosis (table 4). During the 6 months postdiagnosis, the risk of CV-related ER visits in patients with a delayed diagnosis was twice that in patients without a delayed diagnosis (adjusted OR: 1.98; 95% CI: 1.21 to 3.24; p < 0.010; figure 4). 42% of patients with a delayed diagnosis had a CV-related IP hospitalisation compared with 34% of patients without a delayed diagnosis (table 4). The risk of CV-related IP hospitalisations in patients with a delayed diagnosis was more than one and a half times that in patients without a delayed diagnosis (adjusted OR: 1.65; 95% CI: 1.10 to 2.46; p = 0.020; figure 4).

The onset often is insidious and is characterized by subtle and sometimes intermittent changes in memory, personality, concentration, and reaction times. Hepatic encephalopathy is a diagnosis of exclusion; therefore, all other etiologies of altered mental status must be effectively ruled out. 7 Therapy should be directed toward improving mental status via bowel cleansing with lactulose orally or with enemas. One randomized trial demonstrated that diets with normal protein content can be followed safely during episodic hepatic encephalopathy caused by cirrhosis, and that protein restriction has no beneficial effect during such episodes. 11In patients who are refractory to lactulose alone, neomycin can be added.

The rightsholder did not grant rights to reproduce this item in electronic media. For the missing item, see the original print version of this publication. Increases in the ratio of plasma aromatic amino acids to branched-chain amino acids as a consequence of hepatic insufficiency also may contribute to encephalopathy. One meta-analysis suggested that mental recovery was consistently more rapid in patients whose treatment included a branched-chain amino acid infusion; three studies found lower mortality rates in patients who received this treatment, and two others suggested that the treatment increased mortality. Portal Hypertension and Variceal Bleeding Regardless of the etiology of cirrhosis, the development of portal hypertension is nearly universal and results from an increased resistance to portal flow secondary to scarring, narrowing, and compression of the hepatic sinusoids. When the portal pressure exceeds a certain threshold, it results in the development of varices.

Approximately 50 percent of patients with cirrhosis develop varices, most commonly in the distal 2 to 5 cm of the esophagus. The British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for the management of variceal hemorrhage recommend that patients with cirrhosis who present with evidence of upper gastrointestinal bleeding undergo an urgent upper endoscopic evaluation. 9 If no varices are observed, these patients should have repeat endoscopy at three-year intervals. If small varices are diagnosed, patients should have repeat surveillance at one-year intervals. Primary prophylaxis of variceal bleeding is aimed at reducing the portal pressure gradient, azygous blood f low, and variceal pressure. The goals of treatment in acute variceal bleeding include hemodynamic resuscitation, treatment of active bleeding, and prevention of rebleeding. Band ligation is the standard for the control of variceal bleeding.

9 If banding is difficult because of continued variceal bleeding, endoscopic sclerotherapy with vasoconstrictors or a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube insertion may be used until TIPS or surgical treatment can be arranged.
9. TIPS has been shown to improve outcomes and is more cost-effective than endoscopic band ligation in reducing variceal bleeding, but it is associated with a higher risk of encephalopathy. 9 This treatment option should be performed in medical centers with particular expertise. TIPS has been shown to reduce portal hypertension and can be effective in converting patients with diuretic-resistant ascites to diuretic-sensitive ascites, as well as reducing gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with refractory variceal hemorrhage. Evidence regarding whether or not TIPS improves survival is conflicting.

### Feasibility of ultrasound-guided lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injections for management of lumbar radicular back pain [^51f50d43]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Whereas traditional image guidance for placement of transforaminal epidural steroid injections (TFESI) has been fluoroscopy, it has disadvantages including inability to identify soft tissue, radiation exposure, and contrast administration need. Several studies found that ultrasonography is reliable in localizing lumbar nerve root. Few have investigated the feasibility of performing ultrasound guided TFESI in the lumbar spine. This study seeks to aid in filling this gap.

Methods

Patients meeting inclusion criteria (BMI < 25) and exclusion criteria (no spinal deformity or previous lumbar surgery) were enrolled. Ultrasound visualization of nerve root and proximate placement of needle tip guided needle placement. Vascular signals were monitored. The contrast injection was done under real-time ultrasound visualization. Final needle placement with transforaminal epidural spread was assessed for accuracy by contrast fluoroscopy. Complications were assessed.

Results

Thirty ultrasound guided lumbar TFESI were performed. Visualization at the L2, L3, and L4 levels was successful. At the L5 level, needle tip was placed in proximity to the nerve root, but the final needle tip position for transforaminal placement and injection was not visualized; fluoroscopic guidance was used instead. There was no evidence of intravascular injection. No complications were noted.

Conclusion

Ultrasonography shows feasibility as an imaging modality in localizing lumbar intervertebral foramina at higher lumbar levels in patients with normal BMI and no spinal deformities. However, ultrasonography was consistently unable to assist transforaminal needle placement at the L5 level due to poor final needle tip visualization and the requirement of fluoroscopy to advance needle tip transforaminally. While no complications were seen, further controlled trials with larger sample size are needed to investigate safety.

### Feasibility of ultrasound-guided lumbar transforaminal epidural steroid injections for management of lumbar radicular back pain [^9b73b6c3]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Results

Thirty ultrasound guided transforaminal epidural steroid injections were performed: two injections were performed at L2, four injections were performed at L3, fourteen injections were performed at L4 and ten injections were performed at the L5 level.

We could visualize needle tip and real-time injection of contrast with ultrasound at L2, L3 and L4 levels. After contrast injection, AP fluoroscopic images confirmed transforaminal spread (Figure 6).

Figure 6
Comparison of anatomical lumbar anatomy on MRI. The sagittal cuts show the level of the corresponding axial cuts (L3 and L5) at the superior part of the foramen. Appreciate the variation in the anteroposterior angulation of the foramen between L3 and L5.

At the L5 level, the tip of the needle, after using similar technique of placement under ultrasound, was found to be outside the foramen consistently. The AP contrast fluoroscopic imaging demonstrated needle tip placement was lateral and with no epidural flow. To ensure needle placement for epidural flow, the needle tip needed to be advanced under fluoroscopic guidance. Therefore, at the L5 foramen real time transforaminal injection under ultrasound was generally not possible.

### Erenumab-aooe (Aimovig) [^9af9c32f]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.1	Hypersensitivity Reactions

Hypersensitivity reactions, including rash, angioedema, and anaphylaxis, have been reported with AIMOVIG in postmarketing experience. Most hypersensitivity reactions were not serious and occurred within hours of administration, although some occurred more than one week after administration. If a serious or severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs, discontinue administration of AIMOVIG and initiate appropriate therapy [see Contraindications (4), and Patient Counseling Information (17)].

5.2	Constipation with Serious Complications

Constipation with serious complications has been reported following the use of AIMOVIG in the postmarketing setting. There were cases that required hospitalization, including cases where surgery was necessary. In a majority of these cases, the onset of constipation was reported after the first dose of AIMOVIG; however, patients have also presented with constipation later on in treatment. AIMOVIG was discontinued in most reported cases of constipation with serious complications. Constipation was one of the most common (up to 3%) adverse reactions reported in clinical studies [see Adverse Reactions (6.1)].

Monitor patients treated with AIMOVIG for severe constipation and manage as clinically appropriate [see Patient Counseling Information (17)]. The concurrent use of medications associated with decreased gastrointestinal motility may increase the risk for more severe constipation and the potential for constipation-related complications.

5.3	Hypertension

Development of hypertension and worsening of pre-existing hypertension have been reported following the use of AIMOVIG in the postmarketing setting. Many of the patients had pre-existing hypertension or risk factors for hypertension. There were cases requiring pharmacological treatment and, in some cases, hospitalization. Hypertension may occur at any time during treatment but was most frequently reported within seven days of dose administration. In the majority of the cases, the onset or worsening of hypertension was reported after the first dose. AIMOVIG was discontinued in many of the reported cases.

Monitor patients treated with AIMOVIG for new-onset hypertension, or worsening of pre-existing hypertension, and consider whether discontinuation of AIMOVIG is warranted if evaluation fails to establish an alternative etiology.

### Use of natural language processing to objectively identify hepatic encephalopathy in multiple cohorts [^f932e673]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite being a major clinical, financial, and psychosocial burden, hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is not specifically prioritized for liver transplant (LT). Moreover, subjectivity in HE definition can hinder outcome analysis for multicenter trials. Aim: Use natural language processing (NLP) to determine terms associated with an inpatient HE episode across derivation and two validation cohorts.

Methods

NLP terms related to HE were selected using guideline review and physician evaluation. Derivation cohort: Charts from cirrhosis inpatients at Richmond VAMC with MELD3.0 ≥ 15 underwent NLP. Terms with highest sensitivity/NPV were then validated in two independent cohorts from North American Consortium of Study of End-stage Liver Disease (NACSELD cohorts in Richmond VA and VCU). Individual contribution of terms towards HE diagnosis was studied with machine-learning cross-validation.

Results

Derivation: 432 Veterans (4048 notes, 34% HE diagnosis) showed 5 variables associated with HE (asterixis, altered mental status, confusion, initiation/continuation of lactulose/rifaximin) with 85.8%-sensitivity/82.1%-NPV. Internal validation: 164 patients (1536 notes, 26% HE diagnosis) were included where the sensitivity/NPV of these 5 terms was 100% each. External validation:145 patients (6547 notes, 35% HE) were included with 94.1% sensitivity and 84.2%-NPV. On cross-validated machine learning, the top 5 features in both validation cohorts were similar to the derivation cohort. Contribution of the combination of these terms was superior to individual terms in defining HE.

Conclusions

Five signs, symptoms, and treatment decisions with simple phrases extracted from inpatient charts using NLP define HE across three cohorts. This objectivity could aid future policy on LT priority and HE-event adjudication in clinical trials.

### Dordaviprone (Modeyso) [^9527fb9b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of MODEYSO was evaluated in adult and pediatric patients with glioma across five open‑label, non-randomized clinical studies conducted in the U.S. (ONC006 [NCT02525692], ONC013 [NCT03295396], ONC014 [NCT03416530], ONC016 [NCT05392374], and ONC018 [NCT03134131]). Pre-specified criteria were defined to establish an integrated efficacy population; eligible patients were required to have received single-agent MODEYSO, have diffuse midline glioma harboring an H3 K27M mutation with progressive and measurable disease per Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology-High Grade Glioma (RANO-HGG) criteria, be ≥ 90 days post‑radiation therapy, have adequate washout from prior anticancer therapies, have a Karnofsky Performance Status/Lansky Performance Status (KPS/LPS) score ≥ 60, and have stable or decreasing corticosteroid use. Patients with diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), primary spinal tumors, atypical histologies, or cerebrospinal fluid dissemination were excluded. Patients received weight-based dosing of MODEYSO until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

The integrated efficacy population included 50 patients who met these criteria. The major efficacy outcome measure was overall response rate (ORR) assessed by blinded independent central review (BICR) according to RANO 2.0 criteria. Additional efficacy outcome measures were BICR-assessed ORR according to RANO-HGG criteria and Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology-Low Grade Glioma (RANO-LGG) criteria, duration of response, and time to response.

### Phenotypic heterogeneity in genetic and acquired pediatric cerebellar disorders [^01c66d15]. Movement Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Although ataxia was, as expected, the most common movement disorder in our PCD cohort (71%), tremor was present in 28% of individuals and athetosis and dystonia in 17% and 14%, respectively, indicating that non‐ataxia disorders are not uncommon in the PCD population. This finding aligns with that of a recent retrospective cohort study of 51 individuals with pediatric movement disorders, which found ataxia in 53% of cases, dystonia in 49%, tremor in 16%, and chorea‐athetosis in 13%. Another recent study including 606 patients with a childhood‐onset movement disorder found tics to be the most common diagnosis (57%), whereas dystonia was the most common non‐tic movement disorder (12%) in contrast with our findings. Additionally, 3% had ataxia, 3% chorea, 2% spasticity, and 2% tremor. Notably, many participants in the PEDIATAX cohort had combinations of two or more movement disorders, which was another common observation in previous studies. Nevertheless, it is becoming evident that the cerebellum plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of non‐ataxia movement disorders such as dystonia and paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia, potentially redefining what constitutes a cerebellar disorder. In the future, standardized minimal requirements are needed to ensure systematic reporting of clinical phenotypes in PCDs. Similarly, the use of standardized scoring systems such as the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA; applicable from 8 years of age), which we have not included in the current study, will be necessary to facilitate clinical trials.

### Isoniazid [^04e38f3d]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Isoniazid tablets, USP are recommended for all forms of tuberculosis in which organisms are susceptible. However, active tuberculosis must be treated with multiple concomitant anti-tuberculosis medications to prevent the emergence of drug resistance. Single-drug treatment of active tuberculosis with isoniazid or any other medication, is inadequate therapy.

Isoniazid tablets, USP are recommended as preventive therapy for the following groups, regardless of age. (Note: the criterion for a positive reaction to a skin test (in millimeters of induration) for each group is given in parenthesis):

Persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (greater than or equal to 5 mm) and persons with risk factors for HIV infection whose HIV infection status is unknown but who are suspected of having HIV infection. Preventive therapy may be considered for HIV infected persons who are tuberculin-negative but belong to groups in which the prevalence of tuberculosis infection is high. Candidates for preventive therapy who have HIV infection should have a minimum of 12 months of therapy.
Close contacts of persons with newly diagnosed infectious tuberculosis (greater than or equal to 5 mm). In addition, tuberculin-negative (less than 5 mm) children and adolescents who have been close contacts of infectious persons within the past 3 months are candidates for preventive therapy until a repeat tuberculin skin test is done 12 weeks after contact with the infectious source. If the repeat skin test is positive (greater than 5mm), therapy should be continued.
Recent converters, as indicated by a tuberculin skin test (greater than or equal to 10 mm increase within a 2-year period for those less than 35 years old; greater than or equal to 15 mm increase for those greater than or equal to 35 years of age). All infants and children younger than 4 years of age with a greater than 10 mm skin test are included in this category.
Persons with abnormal chest radiographs that show fibrotic lesions likely to represent old healed tuberculosis (greater than or equal to 5 mm). Candidates for preventive therapy who have fibrotic pulmonary lesions consistent with healed tuberculosis or who have pulmonary silicosis should have 12 months of isoniazid or 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin, concomitantly.
Intravenous drug users known to be HIV-seronegative (greater than 10 mm).
Persons with the following medical conditions that have been reported to increase the risk of tuberculosis (greater than or equal to 10 mm): silicosis; diabetes mellitus; prolonged therapy with adrenocorticosteroids; immunosuppressive therapy; some hematologic and reticuloendothelial diseases, such as leukemia or Hodgkin's disease; end-stage renal disease; clinical situations associated with substantial rapid weight loss or chronic undernutrition (including: intestinal bypass surgery for obesity, the postgastrectomy state [with or without weight loss], chronic peptic ulcer disease, chronic malabsorption syndromes and carcinomas of the oropharynx and upper gastrointestinal tract that prevent adequate nutritional intake). Candidates for preventive therapy who have fibrotic pulmonary lesions consistent with healed tuberculosis or who have pulmonary silicosis should have 12 months of isoniazid or 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin, concomitantly.

### Diagnosis and management of cirrhosis and its complications… [^cadf657e]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Cirrhosis leads to intrahepatic resistance, which causes portal hypertension and, at later stages, hepatic insufficiency, which disrupts the liver's normal metabolic functions. Together these features cause gut-barrier disruption and portosystemic shunting, resulting in the multisystem complications of cirrhosis, eg, hepatic encephalopathy, sarcopenia, ascites, and kidney injury. The presence of cirrhosis is associated with an increased risk of complications such as liver cancer and decompensation including ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, and variceal hemorrhage. It is important to evaluate for the presence of cirrhosis in people with risk factors or any diagnosed chronic liver disease. Covert HE: deficits in executive function, sleep disorder, vegetative behavior, and gait disturbance Overt HE: asterixis, disorientation, lethargy, and coma Lactulose, 10–20 g, 2–3 times daily with goal of 2–3 soft bowel movements.

The most common causes of cirrhosis in the US, which can overlap, include alcohol use disorder, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and hepatitis C. Patients with cirrhosis experience symptoms including muscle cramps, pruritus, poor-quality sleep, and sexual dysfunction. Cirrhosis can be diagnosed by liver biopsy but may also be diagnosed noninvasively. Elastography, a noninvasive assessment of liver stiffness measured in kilopascals, can typically confirm cirrhosis at levels of 15 kPa or greater. Approximately 40% of people with cirrhosis are diagnosed when they present with complications such as hepatic encephalopathy or ascites. Conclusions and Relevance Approximately 2. 2 million US adults have cirrhosis. Many symptoms, such as muscle cramps, poor-quality sleep, pruritus, and sexual dysfunction, are common and treatable.

First-line therapies include carvedilol or propranolol to prevent variceal bleeding, lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy, combination aldosterone antagonists and loop diuretics for ascites, and terlipressin for hepatorenal syndrome. What is the most common cause of cirrhosis. Most prevalent cases of cirrhosis in the US are caused by alcohol use disorder, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and hepatitis C infection. Most incident cases of cirrhosis are caused by NAFLD; however, there is also an increase in alcohol-related cirrhosis, particularly among young people. Chronic liver injury results in increased vasoconstrictor signaling and decreased production of vasodilators, further restricting sinusoidal flow. Inflammatory injury from alcohol or steatosis also increases vascular resistance. In both NAFLD and alcohol-related liver disease, heritable factors in lipid metabolism have been associated with progression of liver disease.

57 In addition, chronic liver injury causes hepatocyte loss and reduces the liver's capacity for metabolic activity including protein synthesis, detoxification, nutrient storage, and bilirubin clearance. Increasing portal pressure induces ascites from hepatic sinusoids. Increased sinusoidal pressure causes increased lymph production, which extravasates into the peritoneum when lymphatic drainage capacity is exceeded. Gut-derived toxins, such as ammonia and bacterial products that induce systemic inflammation, cause hepatic encephalopathy. Hepatic encephalopathy can develop at low ammonia levels in the context of infection. 59 While the mechanisms are incompletely characterized, the presence of hepatic fibrosis and hepatic injury from inflammation contribute to the genetic and epigenetic aberrations that lead to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Medical history and physical examination can identify patients with or at risk for cirrhosis.

### Management of portal hypertension in oncologic patients [^5408495a]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Portal hypertension significantly impacts the management and prognosis of patients with primary and secondary hepatic malignancies. Its presence may preclude curative surgical or locoregional therapies, increase perioperative risk, and worsen overall survival. Interventional radiology plays a central role in the management of portal hypertensive complications when medical and endoscopic therapies are insufficient. The mainstay intervention, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), is well-established for variceal bleeding, refractory ascites, and hepatic hydrothorax in cirrhotic patients, and emerging evidence supports its use in selected cancer patients, including those with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and metastatic disease. Splenic artery embolization (SAE) serves as an alternative or adjunctive therapy in patients with contraindications to TIPS, in individuals who have persistent symptoms despite TIPS placement. This document outlines evidence-based management strategies for portal hypertension in cancer patients and discusses technical considerations in TIPS placement and splenic artery embolization.

### Machine learning diagnosis of cognitive impairment and dementia in harmonized older adult cohorts [^1678c80f]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clinical diagnosis (normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment [MCI], dementia) is critical for understanding cognitive impairment and dementia but can be resource intensive and subject to inconsistencies due to complex clinical judgments that are required. Machine learning approaches might provide meaningful additions and/or alternatives to traditional clinical diagnosis.

Methods

The study sample was composed of three harmonized longitudinal cohorts of demographically diverse older adults. We used the XGBoost extreme gradient boosting platform to predict clinical diagnosis using different feature sets.

Results

Measures of cognition were especially important predictive features of clinical diagnosis. Prediction accuracy was higher in a sample that had longer follow-up, better balance across diagnostic outcomes, and both self- and informant-report independent function measures.

Discussion

Algorithmic diagnosis might be a meaningful substitute for clinical diagnosis in studies in which clinical evaluation and diagnosis are not feasible for all participants and may provide a standardized alternative when clinical diagnosis is available.

Highlights

A machine learning algorithm was used to diagnose cognitive impairment and dementia. Measures of cognition were strongest predictive features for clinical diagnosis. Algorithm accuracy was improved by informant-report independent function measures. Algorithmic diagnosis might be an alternative if clinical diagnosis is not feasible. Standardization is an important advantage of algorithmic diagnosis.

### A systematic review and quality appraisal of guidelines and recommendations for home enteral tube feeding in adults [^6024738a]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Guideline recommendations and their assessment using the AGREE-REX tool

Of all recommendations 66% (72/109) were graded as Good Practice Points while 6% (6/109) were of grade A, 18% (20/109) of grade B and 10% (11/109) of grade O. All recommendations were grouped into six clusters which were each assessed using the AGREE-REX tool. A summary of recommendation grades stratified by cluster and guideline is presented in Table S 5.

Clusters for all guidelines scored below 70% for all three domains of the AGREE-REX tool, with no overall score for any cluster > 50% (Table 3). Across all guidelines, 'Clinical Applicability' (56% [39–61%]) was the highest scoring domain, with 'care of feeding sites and enteral access devices' (61% [33–61%]) and 'recommendations for HETF feeds' (61% [56–67%]) the highest scoring clusters in this domain. These clusters also consisted of the highest proportion of A-O graded recommendations with 45% (17/38) and 45% (9/20) respectively (Table S 5). 'Values and Preferences' (21% [17–25%]) was the lowest scoring domain with the corresponding item 6 'values and preferences of policy/decision-makers' (1[1–2]) and item 7 'values and preferences of guideline developers' (1 [1–2]) the lowest scoring items. Raw consensus item scores are available in Table S 6. All recommendation clusters were recommended for use with modifications (Table S 6).

Methods and materials

Patients and data

Our research was granted approval by the Ethics Committee of West China Hospital, Chengdu, China (2021 − 1209). Given the retrospective characteristic of our study and the utilization of de-identified patient data along with confidential information, we obtained a waiver for informed consent from the local institutional review board. Initially, a total of 764 UTUC patients who underwent laparoscopic radical nephroureterectomy with bladder cuff excision between May 2003 and June 2019 were extracted from the database of West China Hospital. Exclusion criteria for this study included patients with limited long-term prognostic data, patients lacking serum albumin (ALB) or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level records, patients who received neoadjuvant therapy, and patients diagnosed with non-urothelial carcinoma confirmed by pathology. Finally, 577 patients were selected for additional investigation (Fig. 1).

The specific screening flow chart of included patients

We obtained clinicopathological data from medical records, which encompassed the age of patients at the time of surgery, their gender, body mass index (BMI), LDH and ALB levels measured within a 2-week period prior to RNU. Additionally, we recorded various tumor characteristics such as location, size, pathological stage and grade, architectural features, histologic types and presence of multifocality, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), lymph node status, surgical margin and adjuvant systemic chemotherapy.

The specimens acquired by RNU underwent individual evaluation conducted by our team of expert pathologists specialized in genitourinary pathology. Additionally, the histopathological staging was carried out following the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) staging system established by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC), while the histopathologic grading adhered to the WHO/ISUP recommendation grading system. The urology-pathological community and numerous experts have widely embraced the histopathological diagnosis of variant histology, with the diagnostic criteria being outlined in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors.

### ACG clinical guideline: malnutrition and nutritional recommendations in liver disease [^b6f77ef6]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Dysbiosis-directed therapies in liver disease — intervention signals and current stance are summarized as follows: Diverse approaches to modify dysbiosis have been used to treat liver disease or its complications, and probiotics have been used with some success in pilot trials in both alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) and MASLD, while fecal transplant has shown some exciting results in treating acute AH, cirrhosis, and hepatic encephalopathy (HE); however, a recent large trial of antibiotic therapy showed no benefit in AH, and by contrast, rifaximin and the prebiotic lactulose are well-accepted therapy for HE; overall, dysbiosis therapy as a specific form of therapy for liver disease/complications (other than HE) cannot be recommended at this time.

Study population

An overview of the trials is provided in Supplementary Table S 1. In brief, the NELSON trial enrolled, from December 2003 through July 2006, individuals between the ages of 50–74, who smoked at least 15 cigarettes per day for ≥ 25 years or 10 cigarettes per day for ≥ 30 years and were current smokers or former smokers who quit < 10 years ago. The intervention arm received four rounds of computed tomography screening with different intervals: at baseline, year 1 (1-year interval), year 3 (2-year interval) and year 5.5 (2.5-year interval). The participants in the control arm received no screening. The NLST enrolled, from August 2002 through April 2004, individuals between the ages of 55–74, who smoked at least 30 pack-years and were current smokers or former smokers who quit < 15 years ago. The intervention arm received three rounds of computed tomography screening with a one-year interval each: at baseline, year 1 and year 2. The participants in the control arm received three rounds of chest radiography screening with the same schedule as the intervention arm. For Belgian NELSON participants, only summarised information on LC incidence and mortality was available. Consequently, they were excluded (NELSON: n = 934). Furthermore, inadvertently randomised never-smokers (NELSON: n = 17), individuals diagnosed with LC before randomisation (NELSON: n = 10), and individuals without known LC incidence dates (NELSON: n = 23, NLST: n = 47) were excluded. The final analyses included 14,808 NELSON (12,429 men, 2377 women, 2 persons with an unknown sex) and 53,405 NLST participants (31,501 men, 21,904 women). The median age of the participants was 58 in NELSON and 60 in NLST. In NELSON, LC diagnoses (n = 743) and LC deaths (n = 400) occurring between randomisation and December 31 st 2015, or 10 years of follow-up since randomisation (whichever came first) were considered. In NLST, LC diagnoses (n = 2055) and LC deaths (n = 977) occurring between randomisation and 7 years of follow-up were considered. For NLST, information on stage and histology was derived through the follow-up of individuals with positive screens, annual status update and medical records, including pathology and tumour staging reports, for all suspected LC. For NELSON, data on cancer diagnosis, histology and stage, vital status, and cause of death were obtained through linkages with the Dutch Center for Genealogic and Heraldic Studies, Statistics Netherlands, and the Dutch Cancer Registry. In NELSON, randomization by screening center was applied. In NLST, blocked randomization stratified by age, sex, and screening center was applied, with blocks of length six or eight (with order of assignment being random within each block). Overall screening adherence rates were similar across the trials (NELSON: 90%, NLST: 95%). Risk-factor data were collected through epidemiologic questionnaires administered at study entry and harmonised across trials (Data Harmonisation Supplementary Appendix, Supplementary Tables S21, S22). The risk-factors considered in developing and validating the different (modelling) methods are shown in Supplementary Table S2. The analyses considered both sexes (with sex as defined by biological attributes; based on self-reported data). We refer the reader to the original trial protocols of the NELSON and NLST trials for the reporting of sex-disaggregated data. Sex was considered as an explanatory variable in all applied modelling methods.

### A systematic review and quality appraisal of guidelines and recommendations for home enteral tube feeding in adults [^89c62fcc]. European Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This review is the first to systematically identify, synthesise and evaluate the methodological quality of available guidelines and their recommendations for HETF. We identified and assessed 15 guidelines of which many were of poor methodological quality, either failing to employ systematic searches of the literature, utilising informal consensus methods, or simply lacking transparency and detail as to the methods employed. Only three of the identified guidelines were of high methodological quality however none of the recommendation clusters relevant to HETF from these guidelines achieved an overall AGREE-REX quality score > 50%. Numerous low-scoring items and domains from both the AGREE-II and AGREE-REX evaluations were attributed to the same methodological shortcomings of the appraised guidelines.

'Rigour of development' has been acknowledged as a critical domain in the appraisal of guideline quality. While scores in this domain were low there was an improvement in the use of systematic search methods and structured consensus over time. A noticeable limitation of most guidelines was the absence of criteria for regular update with only four guidelines ever having been renewed. In the past six years, no updates had been made. 'Evidence' scores were generally low with a majority of recommendations being good practice points, based on low-level evidence or extrapolated from moderate-level evidence. Inconsistent alignment between the definitiveness of some of these good practice point recommendations and the rationale provided, or lack thereof, was the main reason for lower scoring on 'applicability to target users'. Discordant recommendations, that is, when the strength of a recommendation is not reflective of the certainty of evidence, are warranted when there is low quality evidence suggesting benefit in life-threatening situations. The absence of clinical equipoise in providing EN would constitute the conduct of certain randomised controlled trials in this population unethical. When evidence is limited, guideline developers should be transparent as to the considerations made when formulating recommendations. This would include the perspective taken, the value assigned to relevant outcomes, acceptability of the recommendation to relevant stakeholders, resource requirements and the feasibility of implementation. Scarcity of high-quality evidence should not deter guideline developers from creating or updating clinical guidance, rather the well documented limitations of the evidence base could support a redistribution of some resources to rigorous conduct in other aspects of guideline development such as stakeholder engagement and ensuring implementability. Benchmarking studies of local guideline uptake have demonstrated inconsistent adherence and thus further engagement with HETF stakeholders including people receiving HETF, their carers, clinicians involved in service provision, service managers and guideline and policy-makers, would be warranted.
