## Question

Prednisone taper for 2 weeks starting at 40mg once daily

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to manage a prednisone regimen that starts at 40 mg once daily for 2 weeks, specifically whether a taper is necessary, how to implement a taper if indicated, and what monitoring and precautions should be considered. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether 2 weeks at 40 mg constitutes "short-term" therapy and whether abrupt cessation is safe. Then, I should verify disease-specific contexts that might mandate a taper even after brief courses. Next, I will outline a practical taper strategy if one is needed, including decrement sizes and timing. After that, I need to consider adrenal suppression risk and whether any testing is warranted. Finally, I should review monitoring for withdrawal, relapse, and stress-dose instructions, and then synthesize a concise recommendation with caveats for special scenarios.

> Let me first confirm the exposure category. Two weeks at 40 mg prednisone falls into short-term therapy, and for courses under about 3–4 weeks, abrupt cessation is generally acceptable without routine taper or adrenal testing if the patient is clinically well and the underlying disease is controlled, so I should not jump to a taper reflexively here [^1119HRB1].

> Wait, let me verify disease-specific exceptions before concluding. Some conditions explicitly use a 2-week high-dose course followed by a defined taper, which means a taper is indicated even after a short course in those contexts; examples include TB-associated IRIS prevention or treatment, where 40 mg daily for 2 weeks then 20 mg daily for 2 weeks is recommended, and subacute thyroiditis, where 40 mg daily for 1–2 weeks is followed by a gradual taper over 2–4 weeks or longer, so I need to check the indication first [^1119HRB1] [^1158cQEP].

> Hold on, I should also consider patient-specific risk factors for adrenal suppression or withdrawal symptoms. If the patient has had repeated or recent steroid bursts, is on interacting medications like ritonavir, or reports prior withdrawal symptoms, a cautious taper may be prudent even after 2 weeks. Additionally, if the patient is on long-acting agents such as dexamethasone, switching to a shorter-acting steroid like prednisone before tapering is advised to facilitate smoother HPA recovery, so I need to ask about prior steroid exposure and current formulation [^113NbYxg] [^1119HRB1].

> If no disease-specific taper is mandated and the patient is low risk, I should confirm that abrupt cessation after 2 weeks is acceptable. If a taper is preferred for risk mitigation or patient comfort, a brief, moderate taper is reasonable. A pragmatic approach is 40 mg daily for 2 weeks, then 20 mg daily for 3–5 days, then 10 mg daily for 3–5 days, then stop, which aligns with the principle of faster reductions at supraphysiologic doses and mirrors the TB-IRIS 40→20 mg sequence, albeit compressed for a 2-week total taper window; I should double-check that this pace remains above physiologic replacement and thus unlikely to precipitate adrenal crisis in the short term [^115VVS3N] [^115sWmpJ].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought a 50% reduction every 1–2 weeks might be too aggressive for a 2-week taper, but let me reconsider in light of the short total exposure. Given only 14 days at 40 mg, a 50% step-down after the initial 2 weeks is actually consistent with faster tapering in the supraphysiologic range, and compressing the subsequent steps to 3–5 days each keeps the total taper brief while still providing a bridge; I should ensure the patient understands symptoms of withdrawal and adrenal insufficiency so we can adjust if needed [^115sWmpJ] [^1119HRB1].

> Next, I should review adrenal suppression risk and testing. For a 2-week course, routine HPA axis testing is not indicated, and recovery is typically rapid. However, if the patient becomes symptomatic during or after the taper, or if there were prior prolonged exposures, a morning cortisol can be considered once at physiologic doses or if symptoms suggest adrenal insufficiency, recognizing that recovery can be variable and sometimes prolonged after longer courses [^1119HRB1] [^115sWmpJ].

> I will now examine monitoring and patient education. I need to ensure the patient knows to report fatigue, dizziness, nausea, abdominal pain, myalgias, arthralgias, mood changes, or recurrence of the treated condition; if withdrawal symptoms emerge, I should temporarily increase to the last tolerated dose and extend the taper, and if signs of adrenal insufficiency occur, I should revert to a safe dose and reassess the taper cadence, consistent with guidance on glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome and taper safety [^113REYhV] [^111XXZCf].

> But wait, what if intercurrent illness or surgery occurs during or soon after the taper. I should confirm that patients on recent or current steroids know to use stress-dose coverage for major stressors; if the patient is on prednisone at or above about 10 mg daily at the time of stress, additional hydrocortisone is typically unnecessary unless unstable, whereas if below 10 mg or off steroids, short-course stress dosing of hydrocortisone is reasonable during significant illness or procedures, tailored to the severity of stress [^1144zn2F].

> Let me synthesize the final recommendation. For prednisone 40 mg daily for 2 weeks in a patient without disease-specific taper requirements and without high-risk features, abrupt cessation is acceptable. If a taper is preferred or the patient is higher risk, use 40 mg daily for 14 days, then 20 mg daily for 3–5 days, then 10 mg daily for 3–5 days, then stop, with close monitoring for relapse of the underlying condition and for withdrawal or adrenal insufficiency symptoms, and adjust the pace if symptoms arise. If the indication is TB-IRIS or subacute thyroiditis, follow the disease-specific 40→20 mg sequence and broader taper duration instead of this abbreviated plan [^1119HRB1] [^115VVS3N] [^1158cQEP].

---

A prednisone taper from 40 mg daily for 2 weeks should be **individualized** to the indication, response, and risk of adrenal suppression [^115sWmpJ]. For most short courses (≤ 2 weeks), abrupt cessation is acceptable if the patient is asymptomatic and there is no ongoing disease activity [^1119HRB1]. If tapering is needed, a practical approach is to reduce by 10 mg every 3–5 days to 20 mg, then by 5 mg every 3–5 days to 10 mg, then by 2.5–5 mg every 3–5 days until discontinuation, typically over 2–4 weeks. Monitor for relapse and withdrawal symptoms, and adjust the pace as needed [^111XXZCf].

## Clinical indications for prednisone 40 mg daily for 2 weeks

Prednisone 40 mg daily for 2 weeks is commonly used for **short-term management** of inflammatory or autoimmune conditions, including:

- **Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**: 40 mg daily for 5 days, with no taper required if used ≤ 1 week [^112UCpby] [^112hshkK].
- **Asthma exacerbations**: 40–50 mg daily for 5–7 days, with no taper required if used ≤ 1 week [^112b2Sjb].
- **Immune checkpoint inhibitor-related adverse events**: 0.5–2 mg/kg/day with a 4–6 week taper [^114YTyrW] [^111RhXBB].
- **Subacute thyroiditis**: 40 mg daily for 1–2 weeks, then gradual taper over 2–4 weeks [^1158cQEP].
- **Tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)**: 40 mg daily for 2 weeks, then 20 mg daily for 2 weeks, with further tapering based on clinical response [^115VVS3N].

---

## General principles of prednisone tapering

Tapering prednisone aims to **minimize the risk of adrenal insufficiency** and disease relapse while balancing the potential side effects of prolonged corticosteroid use [^115sWmpJ] [^114vQBFm]. The decision to taper and the specific regimen should be individualized based on the following factors:

- **Duration of corticosteroid therapy**: Shorter courses (≤ 2 weeks) generally require less gradual tapering than longer courses [^1119HRB1].
- **Underlying disease activity**: Active disease may necessitate a slower taper to prevent relapse [^114kF4bm].
- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, comorbidities, and previous corticosteroid exposure influence tapering strategy [^notfound].

## Recommended tapering schedule for prednisone 40 mg daily for 2 weeks

For a patient who has received prednisone 40 mg daily for 2 weeks, the following tapering schedule is **recommended**:

| **Week** | **Prednisone dose (mg/day)** | **Duration** |
|-|-|-|
| Week 1 | 40 mg daily | Days 1–14 (already completed) |
| Week 3 | 30 mg daily | Days 15–18 (4 days) |
| Week 3 | 20 mg daily | Days 19–22 (4 days) |
| Week 4 | 10 mg daily | Days 23–26 (4 days) |
| Week 4 | 5 mg daily | Days 27–30 (4 days) |
| Week 5 | 2.5 mg daily | Days 31–34 (4 days) |
| Week 5 | Discontinue | Day 35 |

---

This schedule reduces the dose by 10 mg every 3–4 days until 10 mg is reached, then by 5 mg every 3–4 days until 5 mg, and finally by 2.5 mg every 3–4 days before discontinuation. The total taper duration is approximately **3 weeks**.

---

## Alternative tapering strategies

Alternative tapering strategies may be employed based on **clinical judgment and patient response**. These include a **longer taper** — extending the taper over 4–6 weeks with smaller decrements (e.g. 5 mg every 5–7 days) — or an **alternate-day taper**, transitioning to alternate-day dosing (e.g. 40 mg every other day) before further dose reductions [^1176ye1G].

---

## Monitoring during tapering

During the tapering period, **close monitoring** is essential to detect early signs of disease relapse or adrenal insufficiency:

- **Clinical symptoms**: Fatigue, weakness, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness, and joint pain may indicate adrenal insufficiency or withdrawal syndrome [^notfound].
- **Vital signs**: Monitor for hypotension or tachycardia, which may suggest adrenal insufficiency.
- **Laboratory tests**: Morning cortisol levels may be checked if adrenal insufficiency is suspected, particularly when tapering below physiologic doses (≤ 5 mg/day) [^1119HRB1].

---

## Potential risks and complications of tapering

Tapering prednisone carries potential risks, including **adrenal insufficiency**, which may manifest with fatigue, weakness, and hypotension, particularly if tapering is too rapid or the dose is reduced below physiologic levels [^115sWmpJ]. Disease relapse or recurrence of symptoms may occur if tapering is too rapid or the underlying disease is not adequately controlled. Withdrawal symptoms — such as joint pain, muscle stiffness, and mood changes — may also occur during tapering [^111XXZCf].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing tapering strategy

Several **patient-specific factors** influence tapering strategy:

- **Age**: Older patients may require slower tapering due to increased risk of adrenal suppression and comorbidities.
- **Comorbidities**: Diabetes, hypertension, osteoporosis, and infections may necessitate careful tapering and monitoring.
- **Previous corticosteroid exposure**: Patients with prior prolonged corticosteroid use may require slower tapering due to increased risk of adrenal suppression [^1145nqem].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

Clinical guidelines emphasize **individualized tapering** based on disease activity, duration of corticosteroid therapy, and patient-specific factors [^114kF4bm]. The European Society of Endocrinology recommends tapering glucocorticoids gradually, particularly when doses approach physiologic levels (≤ 5 mg/day) [^1119HRB1].

---

## Summary of recommendations

- **Individualize tapering**: Tailor the tapering schedule to the patient's clinical response, disease activity, and risk factors [^1117Dpyy].
- **Gradual dose reduction**: Reduce the dose by 10 mg every 3–4 days until 10 mg, then by 5 mg every 3–4 days until 5 mg, and finally by 2.5 mg every 3–4 days before discontinuation.
- **Monitor closely**: Watch for signs of adrenal insufficiency, disease relapse, and withdrawal symptoms during tapering [^115u9Dcp].
- **Adjust as needed**: Modify the tapering schedule based on patient response and clinical judgment [^111XXZCf].

---

A prednisone taper from 40 mg daily for 2 weeks should be **individualized**, with a gradual reduction over approximately 3 weeks, and close monitoring for relapse and withdrawal symptoms.

Managing paradoxical TB-IRIS includes evidence from a randomized, placebo-controlled trial showing that prednisone (1.5 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks followed by 0.75 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks) reduced a combined endpoint of days hospitalized plus outpatient therapeutic procedures, with more rapid symptom and radiographic improvement and no reduction in mortality, noting life-threatening neurological cases were excluded; for central nervous system involvement, corticosteroids (either intravenous dexamethasone or oral prednisone) are described as beneficial at presentation. If 4 weeks of prednisone is insufficient, a more gradual steroid taper over 2 to 3 months is recommended (BIII) and should be guided by repeated clinical assessment; corticosteroids should be avoided in patients with Kaposi sarcoma, and case reports describe responses to TNF-blockers or thalidomide in steroid-refractory, prolonged IRIS.

Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome during taper — We recommend consideration of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome that may occur during glucocorticoid taper; when glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is present, glucocorticoid dose can be temporarily increased to the most recent one that was tolerated, and the duration of glucocorticoid taper could be increased. Glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome is reported to occur in 40–67% of patients tapering glucocorticoids following curative adrenalectomy in adrenal Cushing syndrome, and in a recent study symptoms included arthralgias, myalgias, weakness, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and mood changes in up to 50% of patients. For example, a patient treated for several months with prednisone 20–40 mg might experience glucocorticoid withdrawal symptoms, but concerns for spontaneous symptoms and signs of adrenal insufficiency are only a concern once the taper reaches 5–7.5 mg.

Systemic lupus erythematosus glucocorticoid therapy — in organ- or life-threatening SLE flares, the guideline conditionally recommends pulse methylprednisolone treatment (250–1,000 mg for 1–3 days) followed by oral glucocorticoid taper over high-dose oral glucocorticoid taper without pulse treatment. For stable controlled SLE on prednisone > 5 mg/day, it strongly recommends tapering the prednisone to a dose of ≤ 5 mg daily (and ideally to zero) within 6 months. For sustained remission on prednisone ≤ 5 mg/day, it conditionally recommends a slow taper toward zero, and for those unable to taper prednisone to ≤ 5 mg/day, it conditionally recommends initiating or escalating immunosuppressive therapy.

### Dexamethasone versus prednisone and daily oral versus weekly intravenous mercaptopurine for patients with standard-risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a report from the children's cancer group [^116kt4Tr]. Blood (2003). Low credibility.

Conventional therapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) includes prednisone and oral 6-mercaptopurine. Prior observations suggested potential advantages for dexamethasone over prednisone and for intravenous (IV) over oral 6-mercaptopurine, which remain to be validated. We report the results of a randomized trial of more than 1000 subjects that examined the efficacy of dexamethasone and IV 6-mercaptopurine. Children with National Cancer Institute standard-risk ALL were randomly assigned in a 2 x 2 factorial design to receive dexamethasone (6 mg/m²/d) for 28 days in induction, plus taper, compared with prednisone (40 mg/m²/d). The second randomized assignment was for daily oral or weekly IV 6-mercaptopurine during consolidation. During maintenance, 5 days of the randomized steroid was given monthly, at the same dose, and all patients received daily oral 6-mercaptopurine. During delayed intensification, all patients received a dexamethasone dosage of 10 mg/m²/d for 21 days, with taper. Intrathecal (IT) methotrexate was the sole central nervous system-directed therapy. Patients randomly assigned to receive dexamethasone had a 6-year isolated central nervous system-relapse rate of 3.7% ± 0.8%, compared with 7.1% ± 1.1% for prednisone (P = 0.01). There was also a trend toward fewer isolated bone marrow relapses with dexamethasone. The 6-year event-free survival (EFS) was 85% ± 2% for dexamethasone and 77% ± 2% for prednisone (P = 0.002). EFS was similar with oral or IV 6-mercaptopurine; however, patients assigned to IV 6-mercaptopurine had decreased survival after relapse.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1169c14X]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency — tapering and discontinuation strategies are described with limited evidence: "There is no compelling evidence to guide optimal tapering", and "Once glucocorticoids are targeted down to physiologic replacement doses, the panel suggests two possible approaches for the discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy". One approach is "a rapid reduction of the glucocorticoid dose to slightly above physiologic daily dose equivalent (e.g., 7.5 mg prednisone), followed by a further reduction in smaller steps", whereas others "prefer testing of HPA axis to guide further tapering or immediate discontinuation, if normal adrenocortical function is demonstrated". Evidence generation is ongoing as "An ongoing randomized controlled clinical trial (TOAST) is testing abrupt cessation vs gradual tapering once a dose of prednisone 7.5 mg is achieved (87)". During taper, "Patients may gradually taper glucocorticoids while being cautiously monitored for clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency", and "If the patient experiences signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, glucocorticoid regimen should be restarted and not discontinued until recovery of HPA axis is documented".

### Long-term effect of tocilizumab in patients with giant cell arteritis: open-label extension phase of the giant cell arteritis actemra (GiACTA) trial [^115joWrk]. The Lancet: Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

Background

The combination of tocilizumab plus a glucocorticoid taper is effective in maintaining clinical remission without requiring additional glucocorticoid therapy in patients with giant cell arteritis, as shown in part one of the Giant Cell Arteritis Actemra (GiACTA) trial. However, the duration of the tocilizumab effect after discontinuation is unknown. Here, we explored the maintenance of efficacy 1 year after discontinuation of tocilizumab treatment, the effectiveness of retreatment with tocilizumab after relapse, and the long-term glucocorticoid-sparing effect of tocilizumab.

Methods

In part one of the GiACTA trial, 251 patients were randomly assigned (2:1:1:1) to receive subcutaneous tocilizumab (162 mg) once a week or every other week, combined with a 26-week prednisone taper, or placebo combined with a prednisone taper over a period of either 26 weeks or 52 weeks. Patients in clinical remission stopped masked injections at 1 year (the conclusion of part one). In part two, treatment was at the investigators' discretion and could consist of no treatment, tocilizumab, glucocorticoids, methotrexate, or combinations of these, for two years. Maintenance of efficacy as assessed by clinical remission (defined as absence of relapse determined by the investigator), cumulative glucocorticoid dose, and long-term safety were exploratory objectives in part two of the trial. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01791153.

Findings

215 patients participated in part two of the trial; 81 patients who were randomly assigned to tocilizumab once a week in part one were in clinical remission after 1 year, of whom 59 started part two on no treatment. 25 of these 59 patients (42%) maintained tocilizumab-free and glucocorticoid-free clinical remission throughout part two. Median (95% CI) cumulative glucocorticoid doses over 3 years were 2647 mg (1987–3507) for tocilizumab once a week, 3948 mg (2352–5186) for tocilizumab-every-other-week, 5277 mg (3944–6685) for placebo with a 26-week prednisone taper, and 5323 mg (3900–6951) for placebo with a 52-week prednisone taper (van Elteren p ≤ 0.001, tocilizumab once a week vs placebo groups; p < 0.05, tocilizumab-every-other-week vs placebo groups). Tocilizumab-based regimens restored clinical remission among patients who experienced relapse in part two and were treated (median time to remission: 15 days for tocilizumab alone [n = 17]; 16 days for tocilizumab plus glucocorticoids [n = 36]; and 54 days for glucocorticoids alone [n = 27]). No new or unexpected safety findings were reported over the full 3 years of the study.

Interpretation

Giant cell arteritis remains a chronic disease that entails ongoing management and careful vigilance for disease relapse, but continuous indefinite treatment with immunosuppressive drugs is not required for all patients. A substantial proportion of patients treated with tocilizumab for one year maintain drug-free remission during the two years after tocilizumab cessation. For patients who experience relapse, tocilizumab can be used to manage relapses, but it remains prudent to include prednisone for patients who experience relapse because of the risk for vision loss.

### Standardizing steroid protocols for newly diagnosed inflammatory bowel disease patients: a quality improvement initiative [^116cT1aK]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Systemic steroids can be used for induction of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but are not recommended as long-term therapy. Steroid weaning requires rigorous monitoring of symptoms, which may be cumbersome and lead to missed opportunities. We aim to describe our local quality improvement (QI) initiative to improve and standardize the steroid weaning process.

Methods

After identifying drivers of steroid weaning, a protocol was developed and implemented for newly diagnosed IBD patients started on steroids and subsequently initiated on anti-TNF-α therapy. Interventions included development of a tapering schedule, and standardizing communication with patients and evaluation of symptoms. The primary aim was to increase the percent of patients called on a weekly basis by 20%; secondary aims were to decrease the median steroid days by 25% and to increase the number of our patients weaned off steroids at 8 weeks from 35% to 75% by 1 year after the initiative.

Results

The median percent of patients called on a weekly basis to assess clinical symptoms and to wean steroids increased to 80% after 1 year. The median number of systemic corticosteroid days decreased from 67.5 to 50.5 days post-protocol implementation with 61.1% patients weaned off by 8 weeks from discharge. Zero patients were admitted for flares with the protocol implementation.

Conclusion

Our experience illustrates that QI methodology can be used successfully to improve and standardize the steroid weaning process, leading to shortened steroid duration and without increased flares and hospitalizations.

### Management of toxicities from immunotherapy: ESMO clinical practice guideline for diagnosis, treatment and follow-up [^115gbyhH]. Annals of Oncology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for immune checkpoint inhibitor toxicity, more specifically with respect to management of rheumatological toxicity, ESMO 2022 guidelines recommend to initiate prednisone 10–20 mg/day in patients with grade ≥ 2 immune-related-inflammatory arthritis and immune-related polymyalgia rheumatica, and then progressively taper following improvement. Consider administering a higher dosage (0.5 mg/kg) if there is no improvement, as well as conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (methotrexate, hydroxychloroquine, or sulfasalazine) or biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (anti-IL-6 receptor agents, TNF-α inhibitors) for severe or persistent symptoms. Assess ICI treatment continuation on an individual basis.

### AGA clinical practice update on sclerosing mesenteritis: commentary [^112pBT7U]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2025). High credibility.

Sclerosing mesenteritis (SM) — corticosteroids and tamoxifen dosing and response are described as follows: Prednisone monotherapy (30–40 mg a day) may improve short-term symptoms, but long-term treatment is not advised because of side effects; in a large retrospective series of prednisone-treated patients, treatment was typically started at 40 mg a day, continued for 3–4 months, then tapered 5 mg/week, and any benefit is typically lost after drug discontinuation. The most commonly used therapy is tamoxifen, 10 mg twice daily, alone or together with prednisone 40 mg daily; with combination therapy, prednisone is usually tapered after 3 months and tamoxifen continued for maintenance, although how long to continue has not been determined. Maximal response to prednisone and tamoxifen occurs around 4–6 months, with 50%–60% of patients responding; in responders with mild tamoxifen side effects, 10 mg daily may maintain response and improve tolerance, while contraindications include a history of venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or significant cerebrovascular, cardiovascular, or peripheral vascular disease, and active tobacco use is considered a relative contraindication.

### Cyclosporine (cycloSPORINE, modfied) [^11366aHV]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Adjunct therapy with adrenal corticosteroids is recommended initially. Different tapering dosage schedules of prednisone appear to achieve similar results. A representative dosage schedule based on the patient's weight started with 2 mg/kg/day for the first 4 days tapered to 1 mg/kg/day by 1 week, 0.6 mg/kg/day by 2 weeks, 0.3 mg/kg/day by 1 month, and 0.15 mg/kg/day by 2 months and thereafter as a maintenance dose. Steroid doses may be further tapered on an individualized basis depending on status of patient and function of graft. Adjustments in dosage of prednisone must be made according to the clinical situation.

Conversion from Sandimmune to cyclosporine capsules (modified) in Transplant Patients

In transplanted patients who are considered for conversion to cyclosporine capsules (modified) from Sandimmune®, cyclosporine capsules (modified) should be started with the same daily dose as was previously used with Sandimmune®(1:1 dose conversion). The cyclosporine capsules (modified) dose should subsequently be adjusted to attain the pre-conversion cyclosporine blood trough concentration. Using the same trough concentration target range for cyclosporine capsules (modified) as for Sandimmune®results in greater cyclosporine exposure when cyclosporine capsules (modified) is administered (see Pharmacokinetics, Absorption). Patients with suspected poor absorption of Sandimmune®require different dosing strategies (see Transplant Patients with Poor Absorption of Sandimmune, below). In some patients, the increase in blood trough concentration is more pronounced and may be of clinical significance.

### IPNA clinical practice recommendations for the diagnosis and management of children with steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome [^112MVRSh]. Pediatric Nephrology (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for nephrotic syndrome in children, more specifically with respect to management of initial relapse, corticosteroids, IPNA 2023 guidelines recommend to initiate daily oral prednisone in infants aged > 3 months and children or adolescents (1–18 years) with their first episode of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. Administer daily oral prednisone for either:

- 4 weeks at 60 mg/m² or 2 mg/kg (maximum dose 60 mg/day), followed by alternate day prednisone at 40 mg/m² or 1.5 mg/kg (maximum dose of 40 mg on alternate days) for 4 weeks, or

- 6 weeks at 60 mg/m² or 2 mg/kg (maximum dose 60 mg/day), followed by alternate day prednisone at 40 mg/m² or 1.5 mg/kg (maximum dose of 40 mg on alternate days) for 6 weeks.

### Similar efficacy of ciclesonide versus prednisolone to treat asthma worsening after steroid tapering [^114Hd5UY]. Respiratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Rationale

Oral corticosteroids effectively treat asthma exacerbations but are associated with well-described side effects.

Objective

This study compared the efficacy and safety of a high dose of an inhaled corticosteroid with oral prednisolone in patients with worsening of their asthma after medication withdrawal.

Methods

Patients tapered off their inhaled corticosteroids until they reached predefined criteria of "worsening asthma". Randomized patients (n = 130) were treated double blind with either ciclesonide 800mug twice daily (starting with 800mug hourly for 3h after randomization) or prednisolone 40mg once daily for 2 weeks. Spirometry, daily asthma symptoms, morning and evening peak expiratory flow and blood parameters were assessed in all, methacholine challenge and inflammatory measures were determined in induced sputum in a subset of patients.

Results

Ciclesonide was as effective as prednisolone in improving forced expiratory flow in 1s, morning peak expiratory flow and symptoms, the latter improving more rapidly with ciclesonide. No differences were found in methacholine responsiveness or inflammatory measures in sputum or blood. Ciclesonide caused significantly less reduction in morning plasma cortisol levels (p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

This study shows that inhaled ciclesonide (800mug twice daily) has comparable efficacy to oral prednisolone (40mg once daily) to regain asthma control in patients with asthma worsening. The more rapid onset and smaller effect on cortisol suppression suggest a better safety profile of ciclesonide.

### Clinical practice guideline for the management of infantile hemangiomas [^117HSauH]. Pediatrics (2019). High credibility.

Key action statement 3E — systemic corticosteroids for infantile hemangiomas (IHs): Clinicians may prescribe oral prednisolone or prednisone to treat IHs if there are contraindications or an inadequate response to oral propranolol (grade B, moderate recommendation). In the AHRQ review, oral steroids had a mean estimate of expected clearance of 43%. Dose ranges of prednisone or prednisolone reported most frequently are between 2 and 5 mg/kg per day, and most consider optimal dosing to be 2 to 3 mg/kg per day; typical protocols include treating at full dose for 4 to 12 weeks followed by a gradual taper and completion of therapy by 9 to 12 months of age, with some advocating shorter treatment durations (1–6 weeks) with intermittent courses as needed. In the AHRQ review, steroids were consistently associated with clinically important harms, including Cushingoid appearance, infection, growth retardation, hypertension, and mood changes, and the authors considered the SOE to be moderate for the association of steroids with clinically important harms.

### 2016 American Thyroid Association guidelines for diagnosis and management of hyperthyroidism and other causes of thyrotoxicosis [^1158cQEP]. Thyroid (2016). Medium credibility.

Subacute thyroiditis — treatment recommendations state that patients with symptomatic subacute thyroiditis should be treated initially with β-adrenergic-blocking drugs and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), and corticosteroids should be used instead of NSAIDs when patients fail to respond or present with moderate to severe pain and/or thyrotoxic symptoms (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). β-blockers are used as needed to control thyrotoxic symptoms, and NSAIDs provide pain relief in patients with mild symptoms; with NSAIDs, the median time for resolution of pain is 5 weeks (range 1–20 weeks). Patients who do not respond to full doses of NSAIDs over several days should be treated instead with corticosteroid therapy, with standard recommendations of prednisone 40 mg daily for 1–2 weeks followed by a gradual taper over 2–4 weeks or longer; corticosteroids at similar doses had more rapid resolution of pain (median duration, 8 days) compared with NSAIDs (mean duration, 35 days). An effective alternative regimen reported is an initial daily dose of 15 mg of prednisone with tapering by 5 mg every 2 weeks, though 20% of patients required longer than 8 weeks to discontinue the glucocorticoid; levothyroxine may be employed during the hypothyroid stage but should be withdrawn after 3–6 months.

### Cyclosporine (Neoral) [^113VSB5b]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Newly Transplanted Patients

The initial oral dose of Neoral can be given 4 to 12 hours prior to transplantation or be given postoperatively. The initial dose of Neoral varies depending on the transplanted organ and the other immunosuppressive agents included in the immunosuppressive protocol. In newly transplanted patients, the initial oral dose of Neoral is the same as the initial oral dose of Sandimmune. Suggested initial doses are available from the results of a 1994 survey of the use of Sandimmune in US transplant centers. The mean ± SD initial doses were 9 ± 3 mg/kg/day for renal transplant patients (75 centers), 8 ± 4 mg/kg/day for liver transplant patients (30 centers), and 7 ± 3 mg/kg/day for heart transplant patients (24 centers). Total daily doses were divided into two equal daily doses. The Neoral dose is subsequently adjusted to achieve a pre-defined cyclosporine blood concentration (see Blood Concentration Monitoring in Transplant Patients, below). If cyclosporine trough blood concentrations are used, the target range is the same for Neoral as for Sandimmune. Using the same trough concentration target range for Neoral as for Sandimmune results in greater cyclosporine exposure when Neoral is administered (see Pharmacokinetics, Absorption). Dosing should be titrated based on clinical assessments of rejection and tolerability. Lower Neoral doses may be sufficient as maintenance therapy.

Adjunct therapy with adrenal corticosteroids is recommended initially. Different tapering dosage schedules of prednisone appear to achieve similar results. A representative dosage schedule based on the patient's weight started with 2.0 mg/kg/day for the first 4 days tapered to 1.0 mg/kg/day by 1 week, 0.6 mg/kg/day by 2 weeks, 0.3 mg/kg/day by 1 month, and 0.15 mg/kg/day by 2 months and thereafter as a maintenance dose. Steroid doses may be further tapered on an individualized basis depending on status of patient and function of graft. Adjustments in dosage of prednisone must be made according to the clinical situation.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1117Dpyy]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoid taper strategy and formulation choice — the use of long-acting glucocorticoids with higher glucocorticoid potency predisposes to a more pronounced suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis with adrenocortical function impairment, and HPA axis recovery is impossible with continuous administration of long-acting glucocorticoids; when non-oral glucocorticoids are no longer needed, a switch to short-acting oral glucocorticoids would be appropriate, and prednisone and hydrocortisone have a wider variety of available doses and allow for a more gradual taper in smaller decrements; however, the optimal type and dose for tapering has not been established, evidence remains limited and inconclusive, and an individualized approach to taper is possible and necessary.

### 2015 recommendations for the management of polymyalgia rheumatica: a European League Against Rheumatism / American College of Rheumatology collaborative initiative [^117MpuQN]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2015). Medium credibility.

Polymyalgia rheumatica — glucocorticoid (GC) tapering principles state that equivalent objectives may be achieved by alternative tapering schedules; for example, a patient starting at a high prednisone dose (eg, 25 mg/day) may taper faster initially, whereas with a lower initial dose (eg, 12.5 mg/day) the initial dose may be kept longer before reducing. The group suggested prednisone should be tapered by 1 mg/4 weeks or similar once remission is achieved, noted that 1 mg tablets are not available in all countries, and acknowledged alternate-day reductions (eg, 10/7.5 mg on alternate days) are common clinical practice, while not fixing a schedule.

### Comparable 12-month renal response outcomes with medium vs. high-dose starting prednisone in a real-world study of lupus nephritis [^11766hx5]. Rheumatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

The optimal starting dose and tapering of glucocorticoids (GC) in lupus nephritis (LN) remains unknown. We aimed to assess whether a higher prednisone dose results in better 12-month complete renal response (CRR) rates compared with a lower dose, in a contemporary multicentre cohort of LN patients.

Methods

Retrospective and prospective cohort study of patients with new-onset biopsy-proven LN (period 2014-to date). Overall and complete renal response rates at 12months were compared between patients who started with high (> 40mg/day) vs low-medium (≤ 40mg/day) prednisone dose. Multivariable regression and time-to-response analyses were performed, applying inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) to balance baseline covariates and minimize confounding.

Results

A total of 162 patients were included; 101 received a low-medium starting prednisone dose (median 30mg/day) and 61 received a high dose (median 60mg/day). Cumulative prednisone exposure in the first year was significantly higher in the high-dose group (6.9g vs 4.0g; p < 0.001), although cumulative doses equalized by years 2 and 3. The 12-month CRR rates were comparable between high and medium-dose groups (65.4% in the low-medium vs 71.2% in the high-dose group, p = 0.55). In multivariable logistic regression with IPTW, a higher initial prednisone dose was not associated with better CRR rate (adjusted OR 1.00; 95% CI: 0.46–2.22). Similarly, time-to-response analyses showed no difference in achieving overall renal response (log-rank p = 0.26).

Conclusion

Despite significantly increasing GC exposure, a higher starting prednisone dose was not associated with improved renal response rates at 12months in a contemporary LN cohort.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor enterocolitis first-line management — guidelines uniformly recommend systemic glucocorticoids as first-line therapy, commonly using high-dose systemic glucocorticoids in doses of 0.5–2 mg/kg prednisone equivalent daily with a taper of 4–6 weeks. These doses and schedules have not been rigorously examined; lower doses or glucocorticoid-sparing treatments may have clinical benefit, and evidence from mice and humans suggests that systemic glucocorticoids may dampen antitumor responses.

### Management of immune-related adverse events in patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: ASCO guideline update [^114YTyrW]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2021). High credibility.

Tapering of steroids for irAE management — taper length is individualized, but tapering should occur slowly, generally over 4–6 weeks; detailed oral and intravenous (IV) strategies, options for physiologic hydrocortisone when very low doses are reached, and hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis testing guidance are provided. Oral tapering is recommended over 4–6 weeks with a reduction in prednisone or prednisolone of 10 mg every 3–7 days until the dose is 10 mg/d, then reduced by 5 mg every 3–7 days; for IV steroids, tapering is recommended over 4 weeks or longer with initial IV methylprednisolone ≥ 1 mg/kg/d converted to oral prednisone 1 mg/kg/d at minimum, and longer tapers (> 4–6 weeks) may be required. When ready to drop below 5 mg of prednisone or 0.5 mg of dexamethasone after a longer course with concern for iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency, transition to hydrocortisone at physiologic dosing (10 mg in the morning and 5 mg in the afternoon) is an option; if needed for disease control, a simultaneous slow, low-dose taper can decrease by 1 mg prednisone per week, and HPA axis function can be tested 24 hours after the last oral hydrocortisone with AM cortisol and ACTH, with ACTH stimulation for ambiguous results.

### Yearly reduction of glucocorticoid dose by 50% as tapering schedule achieves complete remission for 124 pemphigus vulgaris patients [^116Ntsaw]. The Journal of Dermatology (2016). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoids are the first-line treatment for pemphigus vulgaris. Among 140 patients receiving systemic glucocorticoids, 124 patients achieved complete remission off or on a prednisone dose of ≤ 10 mg/day or less for 6 months or more. The mean average steroid controlling doses were 0.65, 0.62, 0.80, 1.08 and 1.38 mg/kg per day for the mucosal-dominant patients and the mild, moderate, severe and extensive cutaneous-involved patients, respectively (P < 0.001). The mean durations of the initial tapering after controlling doses started were 77.98, 48.78, 31.74 and 28.83 days when the disease was controlled with doses of 40 mg/day or less, 45–60 mg/day, 65–80 mg/day and more than 80 mg/day for the cutaneous-involved types, respectively (P < 0.005). Of the patients, 79.51% achieved complete remission within 3 years, 98.36% within 5 years and all within 6 years, which corresponded to a 50% yearly reduction of glucocorticoid dose. These successfully treated patients indicate that a severity-tailored initial dose of glucocorticoids, an initial tapering duration based on the initial dose and a subsequent 50% yearly tapering regimen may cure pemphigus vulgaris within 3–6 years.

### A clinical response-adjusted steroid treatment protocol for children with newly diagnosed idiopathic nephrotic syndrome [^117FPF7D]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

Rationale & Objective

Prednisone protocols for children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) are generally similar in dose and duration, despite wide variations in time to response. We assessed the feasibility of a novel clinical treatment protocol characterized by a shorter duration and lower cumulative dose for children with early clinical response.

Study Design

Nonrandomized pilot clinical trial.

Setting & Participants

The study population included 59 children with newly diagnosed INS treated between 2014 and 2019 who responded to treatment within 8 days.

Intervention

The intervention group (n = 27) was treated with a response-adjusted protocol during which responders received an 8-week course of tapering doses of prednisone. The usual care group (n = 32) was treated with the standard protocol (prednisone, 60 mg/m²/24 hours for 6 weeks, followed by 40 mg/m²/48 hours for 4 weeks, followed by a slow taper for a total of 24 weeks).

Outcome

Consent rate, cumulative prednisone dose, the development of frequently relapsing or steroid-dependent nephrotic syndrome (FRNS or SDNS, respectively), relapses per year, treatment with steroid-sparing therapies, and adverse effects of steroid therapy over 3 years of follow-up observation.

Results

The consent rate was 88%. The mean cumulative steroid dose for the initial treatment was 70 mg/kg and 141 mg/kg (P < 0.001) in the intervention and usual care groups, respectively. None of the patients in the intervention group relapsed while on faster steroid taper down. The occurrence of FRNS and SDNS in the intervention group was not statistically different than in the usual care group, hazard ratios were 0.80 (95% CI, 0.37–1.73) and 0.61 (95% CI, 0.30–1.27), respectively. The proportions of relapse-free patients were similar (P = 0.5), and adverse steroid events did not differ between the groups.

Limitations

Lack of randomization and small sample size.

Conclusions

These findings demonstrate the feasibility of a shortened duration of steroid dosing for INS when patients demonstrate an initial clinical response to treatment. A larger study is needed to characterize the relative efficacy and toxicity of this novel treatment regimen.

Funding

This study received no funding.

Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) glucocorticoid (GC) tapering and relapse management — The panel strongly recommends individualizing dose-tapering schedules based on regular monitoring of patient disease activity, laboratory markers and adverse events, and the following principles of GC dose tapering are suggested: taper to an oral dose of 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent within 4–8 weeks; for relapse therapy increase oral prednisone to the pre-relapse dose and decrease it gradually (within 4–8 weeks) to the dose at which the relapse occurred; once remission is achieved, taper daily oral prednisone by 1 mg every 4 weeks or by 1.25 mg decrements using schedules such as 10/7.5 mg on alternate days until discontinuation as long as remission is maintained.

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of immune checkpoint inhibitor colitis and hepatitis: expert review [^113w8Uy6]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) colitis management emphasizes exclusion of infection, risk stratification, timely diagnosis, and graded therapy: Infectious causes of diarrhea should be excluded before treatment of suspected ICI colitis, and early stool testing for inflammatory markers in patients with grade 2 or higher colitis/diarrhea (more than 4 bowel movements daily above baseline) according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 5 (CTCAE) and selected patients with less-severe diarrhea may help stratify high-risk patients for endoscopic evaluation; endoscopic confirmation of the diagnosis and severity of ICI colitis should be considered before initiation of high-dose systemic glucocorticoids, and abdominal imaging may be considered to exclude serious complications in patients with dominant symptoms of pain, fever, or bleeding, but should not be performed routinely in patients with diarrhea alone. Rapid progression of ICI colitis may occur within a period of days, particularly in patients treated with ipilimumab, and therefore, prompt diagnosis and treatment is required. ICI colitis typically responds to high-dose systemic glucocorticoids, given in doses of 0.5–2 mg/kg prednisone equivalent daily with a taper of 4–6 weeks; however, these doses and schedules have not been rigorously examined, and infliximab and vedolizumab are reasonable options for treatment of glucocorticoid refractory colitis. Budesonide is ineffective as a prophylactic treatment for ICI colitis, but may be used for treatment of ICI-associated microscopic colitis. Patients who develop ICI colitis may be retreated with immunotherapy under select conditions, and patients with inflammatory bowel disease may have an increased risk of ICI-associated gastrointestinal adverse events, but may derive cancer treatment benefit from checkpoint blockade.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^117HQ6VG]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Medium credibility.

Glucocorticoids are widely prescribed as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agents. This results in at least 1% of the population using chronic glucocorticoid therapy, being at risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency. This risk is dependent on the dose, duration and potency of the glucocorticoid, route of administration, and individual susceptibility. Once glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency develops or is suspected, it necessitates careful education and management of affected patients. Tapering glucocorticoids can be challenging when symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal develop, which overlap with those of adrenal insufficiency. In general, tapering of glucocorticoids can be more rapidly within a supraphysiological range, followed by a slower taper when on physiological glucocorticoid dosing. The degree and persistence of HPA axis suppression after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy are dependent on overall exposure and recovery of adrenal function varies greatly amongst individuals. This first European Society of Endocrinology/Endocrine Society joint clinical practice guideline provides guidance on this clinically relevant condition to aid clinicians involved in the care of patients on chronic glucocorticoid therapy.

Rationale — Responsibilities and referral thresholds in non-endocrine glucocorticoid therapy: The guideline states that management of glucocorticoid therapy is a general medical skill to be handled by the prescribing clinician, with underlying disease guiding taper speed, and notes that the patient population is large (at least 1% of the general population) relative to endocrinology capacity. When stopping therapy, prescribing clinicians should educate their patient on tapering methods, symptoms of adrenal insufficiency, appropriate responses, and proceed to wean the dose; referral to or consultation with an endocrine specialist should be considered when long-term supraphysiologic therapy causes HPA axis suppression greater than 1 year or when adrenal crises occur.

14.11	Clinical Studies in Adults with Uveitis

The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in adult subjects with non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis excluding subjects with isolated anterior uveitis, in two randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Subjects received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after the initial dose. The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was ´time to treatment failure´.

Treatment failure was a multi-component outcome defined as the development of new inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory retinal vascular lesions, an increase in anterior chamber (AC) cell grade or vitreous haze (VH) grade or a decrease in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA).

Study UV I evaluated 217 subjects with active uveitis while being treated with corticosteroids (oral prednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All subjects received a standardized dose of prednisone 60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 15.

Study UV II evaluated 226 subjects with inactive uveitis while being treated with corticosteroids (oral prednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Subjects subsequently underwent a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 19.

Clinical Response

Results from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment failure in subjects treated with adalimumab versus subjects receiving placebo. In both studies, all components of the primary endpoint contributed cumulatively to the overall difference between adalimumab and placebo groups (Table 20).

### Clinical practice guideline: sudden hearing loss (update) [^115Sbbz7]. Otolaryngology — Head and Neck Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Systemic corticosteroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL) — timing and dosing: Spontaneous and steroid-related recovery is greatest in the first 2 weeks, with little benefit after 4 to 6 weeks, and more recent studies encourage treatment within 7 days of onset. For optimal treatment outcomes, the recommended oral prednisone dose is 1 mg/kg/d as a single dose (usual maximum 60 mg daily) for 10 to 14 days; representative regimens include 4 days at the maximum daily dose followed by a 10-mg taper every 2 days, 7 to 10 days at the maximum daily dose followed by a taper over the next week, or 4 weeks at the maximum daily dose followed by a taper. Dose equivalence is prednisone 60 mg = methylprednisolone 48 mg = dexamethasone 10 mg, and methylprednisolone/prednisone dose packs should be avoided for underdosing and delay.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1119HRB1]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Systemic glucocorticoid taper for non-endocrine conditions — short-term versus long-term, withdrawal, and transition: We suggest not to taper in short-term therapy of < 3–4 weeks and state glucocorticoids can be stopped without testing; for long-term therapy, taper only if the underlying disease is controlled and glucocorticoids are no longer required, aiming toward a physiologic daily dose equivalent (eg, 4–6 mg prednisone). We recommend consideration of glucocorticoid withdrawal syndrome with temporary dose increase and prolongation of taper if severe. We recommend against routine adrenal insufficiency testing on supraphysiologic doses or when glucocorticoids are still needed. We suggest switching from long-acting (eg, dexamethasone or betamethasone) to shorter-acting glucocorticoids (eg, hydrocortisone or prednisone) when long-acting agents are no longer needed. We suggest that at a physiologic daily dose equivalent, patients either continue gradual taper with clinical monitoring for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency or be tested with a morning serum cortisol.

### Oral prolonged release beclomethasone dipropionate and prednisone in the treatment of active ulcerative colitis: results from a double-blind, randomized, parallel group study [^114ZELEE]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

Double-blind study comparing efficacy and safety of the topically acting corticosteroid beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) to prednisone (PD) in patients with active, mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis (UC).

Methods

Overall, 282 patients were randomized to receive BDP-prolonged release tablets 5mg once daily for 4 weeks and then every other day for an additional 4 weeks or oral PD 40mg once daily for the initial 2 weeks tapered of 10mg every 2 weeks during the 8-week study period. Efficacy end point was the non-inferiority of BDP vs. PD in terms of Disease Activity Index (DAI) score < 3 or reduction by at least 3 points for patients with a baseline DAI ≥ 7 at week 4. Safety end point was the proportion of patients with steroid-related adverse events (AEs) and cortisol < 150nmol/l at week 4.

Results

DAI response rates at week 4 were 64.6% and 66.2% with BDP and PD, respectively, demonstrating non-inferiority of BDP vs. PD (delta: -1.56; 95% confidence interval (CI) -13.00–9.88, P = 0.78). Patients with steroid-related AEs and cortisol < 150nmol/l at week 4 were 38.7% in the BDP group and 46.9% in the PD group (P = 0.17 between groups). No safety signals were observed in both the groups.

Conclusions

BDP was non-inferior to PD in the treatment of active UC, with a good safety profile in both the groups.

Regarding medical management for polymyalgia rheumatica, more specifically with respect to corticosteroids, tapering, ACR/EULAR 2015 guidelines recommend to follow an individualized corticosteroid tapering schedule, predicated to regular monitoring of patient disease activity, laboratory markers and adverse events. Consider following the following principles of corticosteroid dose tapering:

| **Situation** | **Guidance** |
|-|-|
|Initial tapering|- Taper dose to an oral dose of 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent within 4–8 weeks|
|Treatment of relapse|- Increase oral prednisone to the pre-relapse dose and decrease it gradually to the dose at which the relapse occurred|
|Tapering once remission is achieved following initial and relapse therapies|- Taper daily oral prednisone by 1 mg every 4 weeks until discontinuation, as long as remission is maintained.|

Practice Point 9.3.1.6 — oral glucocorticoid tapering in ANCA vasculitis (AAV): Recommendations for oral glucocorticoid tapering are given in Figure 79, and this is a new practice point for the 2021 guideline that offers reduced-dose corticosteroid tapering schedules for patients based on body weight. We agree with this recommendation to adopt the reduced-dose glucocorticoid dosing of the PEXIVAS trial with 2 comments, including that only 15% of the patients received rituximab for remission induction; for this reason, if using reduced-dose glucocorticoids, we suggest close monitoring of kidney function during the first 4 weeks for patients receiving rituximab for induction therapy and in those presenting with organ-threatening kidney involvement. The ADVOCATE trial demonstrated that avacopan had similar efficacy to high-dose glucocorticoids at week 26 and superior efficacy at week 52 when used with either rituximab or cyclophosphamide, the avacopan group received glucocorticoids although the mean daily dose was one-third of the prednisone arm, and avacopan was FDA-approved as an adjunct therapy for AAV in 2021; we agree that cyclophosphamide dose needs adjustment based on follow-up WBC count and GFR.

14.10 Adult Uveitis

The safety and efficacy of adalimumab were assessed in adult patients with non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis excluding patients with isolated anterior uveitis, in two randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled studies (UV I and II). Patients received placebo or adalimumab at an initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week starting one week after the initial dose. The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was ´time to treatment failure´.

Treatment failure was a multi-component outcome defined as the development of new inflammatory chorioretinal and/or inflammatory retinal vascular lesions, an increase in anterior chamber (AC) cell grade or vitreous haze (VH) grade or a decrease in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA).

Study UV I evaluated 217 patients with active uveitis while being treated with corticosteroids (oral prednisone at a dose of 10 to 60 mg/day). All patients received a standardized dose of prednisone 60 mg/day at study entry followed by a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 15.

Study UV II evaluated 226 patients with inactive uveitis while being treated with corticosteroids (oral prednisone 10 to 35 mg/day) at baseline to control their disease. Patients subsequently underwent a mandatory taper schedule, with complete corticosteroid discontinuation by Week 19.

Clinical Response

Results from both studies demonstrated statistically significant reduction of the risk of treatment failure in patients treated with adalimumab versus patients receiving placebo. In both studies, all components of the primary endpoint contributed cumulatively to the overall difference between adalimumab and placebo groups (Table 20).

Note: P# = Placebo (Number of Events/Number at Risk); A# = Adalimumab (Number of Events/Number at Risk).

HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) — We suggest that clinicians consider corticosteroids as an adjunct to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in patients with biopsy-confirmed HIVAN (weak, low). Studies of HIVAN used prednisone 60 mg/day or the equivalent of 1 mg/kg of prednisone per day, with renal improvement typically observed after 1–4 weeks; responders were continued at that dose for 2–11 weeks then tapered off over 2–26 weeks, and we recommend that patients who do not respond after 1–4 weeks of prednisone should be rapidly tapered. Corticosteroids for the treatment of HIVAN should be considered only if all other etiologies for kidney disease have been excluded, and the use of corticosteroids for HIV-related kidney diseases other than HIVAN cannot be recommended. Benefits state corticosteroids may reduce kidney disease progression in HIV-infected patients with HIVAN, but harms include association with an increased risk of avascular necrosis in patients with HIV and reports of a 4- to 7-fold increased risk of avascular necrosis in association with prior corticosteroid use.

### Prednisone (predniSONE tablets, USP, 20 mg) [^1176ye1G]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

The following should be kept in mind when considering alternate day therapy:

Basic principles and indications for corticosteroid therapy should apply. The benefits of ADT should not encourage the indiscriminate use of steroids.
ADT is a therapeutic technique primarily designed for patients in whom long-term pharmacologic corticoid therapy is anticipated.
In less severe disease processes in which corticoid therapy is indicated, it may be possible to initiate treatment with ADT. More severe disease states usually will require daily divided high dose therapy for initial control of the disease process. The initial suppressive dose level should be continued until satisfactory clinical response is obtained, usually four to ten days in the case of many allergic and collagen diseases. It is important to keep the period of initial suppressive dose as brief as possible particularly when subsequent use of alternate day therapy is intended. Once control has been established, two courses are available: (a) change to ADT and then gradually reduce the amount of corticoid given every other day or (b) following control of the disease process reduce the daily dose of corticoid to the lowest effective level as rapidly as possible and then change over to an alternate day schedule. Theoretically, course (a) may be preferable.
Because of the advantages of ADT, it may be desirable to try patients on this form of therapy who have been on daily corticoids for long periods of time (e.g., patients with rheumatoid arthritis). Since these patients may already have a suppressed HPA axis, establishing them on ADT may be difficult and not always successful. However, it is recommended that regular attempts be made to change them over. It may be helpful to triple or even quadruple the daily maintenance dose and administer this every other day rather than just doubling the daily dose if difficulty is encountered. Once the patient is again controlled, an attempt should be made to reduce this dose to a minimum.
As indicated above, certain corticosteroids, because of their prolonged suppressive effect on adrenal activity, are not recommended for alternate day therapy (e.g., dexamethasone and betamethasone).
The maximal activity of the adrenal cortex is between 2 am and 8 am, and it is minimal between 4 pm and midnight. Exogenous corticosteroids suppress adrenocortical activity the least, when given at the time of maximal activity (am).
In using ADT it is important, as in all therapeutic situations to individualize and tailor the therapy to each patient. Complete control of symptoms will not be possible in all patients. An explanation of the benefits of ADT will help the patient to understand and tolerate the possible flare-up in symptoms which may occur in the latter part of the off-steroid day. Other symptomatic therapy may be added or increased at this time if needed.
In the event of an acute flare-up of the disease process, it may be necessary to return to a full suppressive daily divided corticoid dose for control. Once control is again established alternate day therapy may be re-instituted.
Although many of the undesirable features of corticosteroid therapy can be minimized by ADT, as in any therapeutic situation, the physician must carefully weigh the benefit-risk ratio for each patient in whom corticoid therapy is being considered.

Glucocorticoid tapering safety — Evidence from included studies: One study considered only the patient group tapering glucocorticoids (n = 131), and another evaluated a rapid, individualized steroid-reduction algorithm after benralizumab initiation in 598 patients with severe, eosinophilic asthma; across all five studies, the data showed no symptomatic adrenal insufficiency or clinical events related to potential adrenal insufficiency during follow-up. The authors note that these results suggest it is often safe to stop glucocorticoids abruptly after short-term high-dose use, and that after long-term use, more rapid tapering at supraphysiologic dosing followed by a slower taper at physiologic dosing appears safe; no studies compared different tapering schemes.

Steroid-sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SSNS) in children — treatment of the initial episode — We recommend that corticosteroid therapy (prednisone or prednisolone)* be given for at least 12 weeks, We recommend that oral prednisone be administered as a single daily dose starting at 60 mg/ m2/d or 2 mg/kg/d to a maximum 60 mg/d, and We recommend that daily oral prednisone be given for 4–6 weeks followed by alternate-day medication as a single daily dose starting at 40 mg/m2 or 1.5 mg/kg (maximum 40 mg on alternate days) and continued for 2–5 months with tapering of the dose. Prednisone and prednisolone are equivalent, used in the same dosage, and have both been used in RCTs depending on the country of origin.

Mild active GO treated with RAI — concurrent glucocorticoids: In the absence of any strong contraindication to GC use we suggest considering them for coverage of GD patients with mild active GO who are treated with RAI, even in the absence of risk factors for GO deterioration. The decision on whether to administer concurrent glucocorticoids in a particular patient choosing RAI therapy should be made in the light of risk–benefit considerations (i.e., their personal risk of worsening GO, balanced against their risk of developing glucocorticoid side effects). Risk factors for deterioration to be considered include active and progressive GO over the preceding 3 months and high serum pretreatment TRAb levels (normal < 1.75 IU/L, high risk for GO progression if > 8.8 IU/L). For prophylaxis, a randomized clinical trial validated prednisone 0.4–0.5 mg/kg per day, started 1–3 days after RAI administration, continued for 1 month, and then tapered over 2 months; a retrospective cohort suggested about 0.2 mg/kg per day for 6 weeks may be equally effective for prevention of GO exacerbation in patients with initially mild or absent eye disease; currently most task force members use a minimum starting dose of 30 mg prednisone daily, tapering off within 6–8 weeks.

An intramuscular option has been studied: In one randomized controlled trial, 120 mg methylprednisolone intramuscular (i.m.) injection was used every 3 weeks as a starting dose. As an adjunct, Methotrexate (MTX) has been used at doses of 7.5–10 mg/week in clinical trials, and the algorithm advises, Consider MTX if at high risk for side effects/ relapse and/or prolonged therapy. Following improvement, the algorithm specifies Gradual tapering of glucocorticoids and ultimately to Taper prednisone until discontinuation. Baseline factors associated with higher risk of relapse/prolonged therapy include high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (> 40 mm/hour) and peripheral inflammatory arthritis.

### Corticosteroids in severe alcohol-associated hepatitis. not so fast: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials [^116sPXwA]. Hepatology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Aims

Severe alcohol-associated hepatitis (AH) is rising in incidence with a high mortality burden. While corticosteroids are recommended for eligible patients with severe AH, no guidance exists for the timing of steroid initiation, tapering regimens, and surveillance of adverse events. We aim to systematically review these variables and provide evidence-based recommendations for the inpatient and outpatient management of severe AH.

Approach and Results

We performed a literature search from inception to May 30, 2024, to include clinical trials published in full form and assessed the quality of evidence using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Data were collected on the timing of initiation, rate, and complications following steroid therapy, and taper regimens in the setting of severe AH. Of 28 studies that fulfilled our inclusion criteria, the median time from admission to steroid initiation was 6.5 days. The most common steroid dosing regimen was prednisolone 40 mg daily for 28 days. Twenty-five studies containing 3196 subjects reported adverse events, with exactly 50% in the steroid arm and the other half in the comparison arm. Infections, gastrointestinal bleeds, and renal impairment were the most frequently reported adverse events. Most infections occurred within the first month of the study. A 2-week steroid taper was the most frequently reported regimen.

Conclusions

We recommend taking up to a week to systematically and thoroughly evaluate patients before initiating steroids, and vigilant monitoring in the first month of treatment. We also recommend the lowest possible steroid exposure with a 2-week steroid taper and close outpatient follow-up.

### Continuing versus tapering glucocorticoids after achievement of low disease activity or remission in rheumatoid arthritis (SEMIRA): a double-blind, multicentre, randomised controlled trial [^1138zgSy]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

Patients with inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, often receive glucocorticoids, but long-term use can produce adverse effects. Evidence from randomised controlled trials to guide tapering of oral glucocorticoids is scarce. We investigated a scheme for tapering oral glucocorticoids compared with continuing low-dose oral glucocorticoids in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Methods

The Steroid EliMination In Rheumatoid Arthritis (SEMIRA) trial was a double-blind, multicentre, two parallel-arm, randomised controlled trial done at 39 centres from six countries (France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Serbia, and Tunisia). Adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving tocilizumab and glucocorticoids 5–15 mg per day for 24 weeks or more were eligible for inclusion if they had received prednisone 5 mg per day for 4 weeks or more and had stable low disease activaity, confirmed by a Disease Activity Score for 28 joints-erythrocyte sedimentation rate (DAS28-ESR) of 3.2 or less 4–6 weeks before and on the day of randomisation. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to either continue masked prednisone 5 mg per day for 24 weeks or to taper masked prednisone reaching 0 mg per day at week 16. All patients received tocilizumab (162 mg subcutaneously every week or 8 mg/kg intravenously every 4 weeks) with or without csDMARDs maintained at stable doses during the entire 24-week study. The primary outcome was the difference in mean DAS28-ESR change from baseline to week 24, with a difference of more than 0.6 defined as clinically relevant between the continued-prednisone group and the tapered-prednisone group. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02573012.

Findings

Between Oct 21, 2015, and June 9, 2017, 421 patients were screened and 259 (200 [77%] women and 59 [23%] men) were recruited onto the trial. In all 128 patients assigned to the continued-prednisone regimen, disease activity control was superior to that in all 131 patients assigned to the tapered-prednisone regimen; the estimated mean change in DAS28-ESR from baseline to week 24 was 0.54 (95% CI 0.35–0.73) with tapered prednisone and -0.08 (-0.27 to 0.12) with continued prednisone (difference 0.61 [0.35–0.88]; p < 0.0001), favouring continuing prednisone 5 mg per day for 24 weeks. Treatment was regarded as successful (defined as low disease activity at week 24, plus absence of rheumatoid arthritis flare for 24 weeks and no confirmed adrenal insufficiency) in 99 (77%) patients in the continued-prednisone group versus 85 (65%) patients in the tapered-prednisone group (relative risk 0.83; 95% CI 0.71–0.97). Serious adverse events occurred in seven (5%) patients in the tapered-prednisone group and four (3%) patients in the continued-prednisone group; no patients had symptomatic adrenal insufficiency.

Interpretation

In patients who achieved low disease activity with tocilizumab and at least 24 weeks of glucocorticoid treatment, continuing glucocorticoids at 5 mg per day for 24 weeks provided safe and better disease control than tapering glucocorticoids, although two-thirds of patients were able to safely taper their glucocorticoid dose.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The initial dosage of prednisone may vary from 5 mg to 60 mg of prednisone per day depending on the specific disease entity being treated. In situations of less severity lower doses will generally suffice while in selected patients higher initial doses may be required. The initial dosage should be maintained or adjusted until a satisfactory response is noted. If after a reasonable period of time there is a lack of satisfactory clinical response, prednisone should be discontinued and the patient transferred to other appropriate therapy. IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT DOSAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE VARIABLE AND MUST BE INDIVIDUALIZED ON THE BASIS OF THE DISEASE UNDER TREATMENT AND THE RESPONSE OF THE PATIENT. After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage which will maintain an adequate clinical response is reached. It should be kept in mind that constant monitoring is needed in regard to drug dosage. Included in the situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment; in this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of prednisone for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.

Multiple Sclerosis

In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis daily doses of 200 mg of prednisolone for a week followed by 80 mg every other day for 1 month have been shown to be effective. (Dosage range is the same for prednisone and prednisolone.)

Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) — type-specific medical therapy includes MMI 40 mg daily for type 1 AIT, with rare addition of potassium perchlorate 250 mg four times daily, and prednisone 40 mg daily for type 2 AIT with improvement occasionally as early as 1 week. In one study of 20 AIT patients treated with perchlorate for 1 month, euthyroidism occurred in 12 patients (7 with type 1 AIT and 5 with type 2 AIT), and the eight nonresponders achieved euthyroidism after corticosteroids after an average of approximately 6 weeks. When type cannot be clearly distinguished, a combination of prednisone and methimazole should be used until stabilization, after which drugs may be individually tapered. Technical dosing remarks specify MMI 40 mg once daily until euthyroid (generally 3–6 months) and corticosteroids equivalent to prednisone 40 mg once daily for 2–4 weeks followed by a gradual taper over 2–3 months.

### Comparison of corticosteroid tapering regimens in myasthenia gravis… [^116Jxmsk]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

In the slow-tapering group, prednisone was given on alternate days, as described elsewhere. 8 The initial dose was 10 mg and was increased by increments of 10 mg every 2 days up to 1. 5 mg/kg of body weight on alternate days without exceeding 100 mg. This dose was maintained until MMS was reached and then reduced by 10 mg every 2 weeks until a dosage of 40 mg was reached, with subsequent slowing of the taper to 5 mg monthly. In the rapid-tapering group, oral prednisone was immediately started at 0. 75 mg/kg/d. The prednisone tapering protocol depended on the MGFA postintervention status. 2 First, if the patient reached MMS at 1 month, the dose of prednisone was reduced by 0. 1 mg/kg every 10 days up to
0. 45 mg/kg/d, then 0. 05 mg/kg every
10. Second, if the state of MMS was not reached at 1 month but the participant had improved according to the MGFA postintervention status, the prednisone dose was decreased by 0. 1 mg/kg every 20 days until the dose of
0.

45 mg/kg/d was achieved, then 0. 05 mg/kg every 20 days up to
0. 25 mg/kg/d, and then by decrements of 1 mg as described in the preceding paragraph. If the participant reached MMS during this tapering process, the tapering of prednisone was similar to the sequence described in the first stage. Third, if MMS was not reached and the participant had not improved, the initial dose was maintained for the first 3 months; beyond that time, a decrease in the prednisone dose was undertaken as follows: decrease of 0. 1 mg/kg every 20 days up to
0. 45 mg/kg/d, then by 0. 05 mg/kg every 20 days up to
0. 25 mg/kg/d, after which the prednisone dose was not reduced further. It is noteworthy that prednisone was discontinued earlier than expected in the slow-tapering group. The mean daily prednisone doses at 12 and 15 months were 8 and 2 mg in the slow-tapering arm but above 20 mg in a trial on thymectomy. 8 This difference indicates that the slow-tapering regimen in our trial has been fairly applied.

It is likely that the monthly follow-up enabled optimal adjustment of the prednisone dose in both therapeutic groups.

Therapeutic immune suppression and corticosteroids — Reduction or modification of immune suppression should be discussed, when appropriate, prior to initiation of ICI therapy (LE:5). For patients with melanoma who are receiving high-dose corticosteroids, the dose of corticosteroids should be reduced to ≤ 10 mg prednisone (or equivalent) per day, if possible, prior to initiation of ICI therapy (LE:3). This does not apply to corticosteroids for solid organ allograft preservation. For patients who are unable to taper to ≤ 10 mg prednisone per day, individual consideration is required with possible subspecialty co-management.

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^114tSANd]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Glucocorticoid tapering and persistent adrenal insufficiency — patients with a history of glucocorticoid treatment/exposure presenting with manifestations of Cushing syndrome should be assumed to have a fully suppressed hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis and managed accordingly, and we suggest evaluation by an endocrinology specialist if there is no recovery of HPA axis in one year while on physiologic daily dose equivalent and also for patients on glucocorticoids with a history of adrenal crisis. Adrenal insufficiency may last even up to 2–4 years after cessation, and persistent impairment beyond four years suggests recovery is very unlikely and long-term glucocorticoid replacement should be continued, with additional testing beyond four years considered case-by-case. Patients with adrenal insufficiency for more than one year should be treated with standard replacement doses of hydrocortisone or prednisone, and education is necessary on adjusting substitution doses during stressful situations to prevent or manage adrenal crises.

### Dexamethasone (taperDex 12-day) [^111TBBG5]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

For oral administration: The initial dosage of dexamethasone varies from 0.75 to 9 mg a day depending on the disease being treated.

It Should Be Emphasized That Dosage Requirements Are Variable And Must Be Individualized On The Basis Of The Disease Under Treatment And The Response Of The Patient.

After a favorable response is noted, the proper maintenance dosage should be determined by decreasing the initial drug dosage in small decrements at appropriate time intervals until the lowest dosage that maintains an adequate clinical response is reached.

Situations which may make dosage adjustments necessary are changes in clinical status secondary to remissions or exacerbations in the disease process, the patient's individual drug responsiveness, and the effect of patient exposure to stressful situations not directly related to the disease entity under treatment. In this latter situation it may be necessary to increase the dosage of the corticosteroid for a period of time consistent with the patient's condition. If after long-term therapy the drug is to be stopped, it is recommended that it be withdrawn gradually rather than abruptly.

In the treatment of acute exacerbations of multiple sclerosis, daily doses of 30 mg of dexamethasone for a week followed by 4 to 12 mg every other day for one month have been shown to be effective (see PRECAUTIONS, Neuropsychiatric). In pediatric patients, the initial dose of dexamethasone may vary depending on the specific disease entity being treated. The range of initial doses is 0.02 to 0.3 mg/kg/day in three or four divided doses (0.6 to 9 mg/m² body surface area/day).

### European Society of Endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^115sWmpJ]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

European Society of Endocrinology/Endocrine Society guideline — clinical scope and tapering principles: Chronic glucocorticoid therapy results in "at least 1% of the population" using it and "being at risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency", and this risk "is dependent on the dose, duration and potency of the glucocorticoid, route of administration, and individual susceptibility". Once glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency develops or is suspected, it "necessitates careful education and management of affected patients". Tapering "can be challenging when symptoms of glucocorticoid withdrawal develop, which overlap with those of adrenal insufficiency", and "in general, tapering of glucocorticoids can be more rapidly with a supraphysiological dosage range, followed by a slower taper when on physiologic glucocorticoid dosing". The "degree and persistence of HPA axis suppression after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy are dependent on overall exposure" and "recovery of adrenal function varies greatly amongst individuals".

### AGA clinical practice update on diagnosis and management of immune checkpoint inhibitor colitis and hepatitis: expert review [^115fDAR6]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) hepatitis management by grade is outlined as follows: For grade 1 hepatitis (AST/ALT 1–3× the upper limit of normal [ULN] or total bilirubin 1.5–3× ULN), more frequent monitoring with once or twice weekly blood draws is suggested, with or without a delay in ICI dosing. For grade 2 ICI hepatitis (AST/ALT > 3–5× ULN or total bilirubin > 1.5–3× ULN), holding ICI treatment is suggested; consultation with a gastroenterologist or hepatologist should be considered and potential hepatotoxins should be discontinued if medically feasible. In symptomatic grade 2 disease, prednisone 0.5–1.0 mg/kg/d or equivalent may be administered, and ICI may be resumed when recovered to grade 1 with a steroid dose of ≤ 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent daily; if hepatitis fails to resolve after a 1- to 2-week delay in ICI dosing, systemic glucocorticoids should be administered. For grade 3 ICI hepatitis (AST/ALT > 5–20× ULN or total bilirubin > 3–10× ULN), ICI therapy should be discontinued and glucocorticoids are generally initiated at 1–2 mg/kg/d of prednisone or equivalent with a planned 4- to 6-week taper. For patients who do not respond to glucocorticoids within 3–5 days or who have hepatitis flare during steroid taper, second-line immunomodulators such as azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or tacrolimus may be considered; infliximab should be used with caution in suspected ICI hepatitis. For grade 4 ICI hepatitis (AST/ALT > 20× ULN or total bilirubin > 10× ULN or hepatic decompensation), patients should be hospitalized, ICI should be permanently discontinued, and therapy started on 2 mg/kg/d methylprednisolone or equivalent with a planned 4- to 6-week taper; if there is not a drop in transaminases of at least 50% in 3 days, secondary immune suppression with azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or tacrolimus should be started, and antithymocyte globulin should be reserved for refractory and severe cases.

### Cyclosporine (Sandimmune) [^115ia6oR]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

See Blood Concentration Monitoring, below.

Specific Populations

Renal Impairment

Cyclosporine undergoes minimal renal elimination and its pharmacokinetics do not appear to be significantly altered in patients with end-stage renal disease who receive routine hemodialysis treatments (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). However, due to its nephrotoxic potential (see WARNINGS), careful monitoring of renal function is recommended; cyclosporine dosage should be reduced if indicated (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).

Hepatic Impairment

The clearance of cyclosporine may be significantly reduced in severe liver disease patients (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY). Dose reduction may be necessary in patients with severe liver impairment to maintain blood concentrations within the recommended target range (see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS).

Pediatrics

In pediatric usage, the same dose and dosing regimen may be used as in adults although in several studies, children have required and tolerated higher doses than those used in adults.

Adjunct therapy with adrenal corticosteroids is recommended. Different tapering dosage schedules of prednisone appear to achieve similar results. A dosage schedule based on the patient's weight started with 2.0 mg/kg/day for the first 4 days tapered to 1.0 mg/kg/day by 1 week, 0.6 mg/kg/day by 2 weeks, 0.3 mg/kg/day by 1 month, and 0.15 mg/kg/day by 2 months and thereafter as a maintenance dose. Another center started with an initial dose of 200 mg tapered by 40 mg/day until reaching 20 mg/day. After 2 months at this dose, a further reduction to 10 mg/day was made. Adjustments in dosage of prednisone must be made according to the clinical situation.

Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) induction and taper dosing with prednisone/prednisolone and azathioprine (AZA) is specified as follows: Prednisone alone is 40–60 mg daily in adults and 1–2 mg/kg daily in children (maximum dose 40–60 mg daily), or a lower dose of prednisone 20–40 mg daily in combination with AZA; AZA adult dosing is United States 50–150 mg daily, Europe 1–2 mg/kg daily, and pediatric 1–2 mg/kg daily. Some centers advocate using prednisone 1 mg/kg for adult patients. In Europe, prednisolone (1 mg/kg daily) is administered with AZA (1–2 mg/kg daily). Most centers recommend waiting 2 weeks before starting AZA to confirm steroid responsiveness, evaluate TPMT status, and exclude AZA-induced hepatitis. Once a biochemical remission has been achieved, response-guided therapy is advocated, with reduction to 20 mg daily while monitoring laboratory tests every 2 weeks, followed by a gradual taper of 2.5–5 mg every 2–4 weeks to achieve a lower dose of 5–10 mg daily.

### An international, phase III, randomized trial of mycophenolate mofetil in myasthenia gravis [^113ZSPyJ]. Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

This prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase III trial assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as a steroid-sparing agent in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG).

Methods

Patients with acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive class II-IVa MG (MG Foundation of America [MGFA] criteria) taking corticosteroids for at least 4 weeks were randomized to MMF (2 g/day) or placebo for 36 weeks. The primary endpoint was a composite measure defined as achievement of minimal manifestations or pharmacologic remission (MGFA post-intervention status), with reduction of corticosteroid dose on a set schedule. Secondary endpoints included disease severity, quality-of-life scores, and safety.

Results

A total of 44% of MMF-treated (n = 88) and 39% of placebo-receiving (n = 88) patients achieved the primary endpoint (p = 0.541). Improvements in mean quantitative MG, MG activities of daily living, and 36-item Short-Form health survey scores were similar in both groups. Numbers of adverse events were similar in both groups. The most commonly reported adverse events in the MMF-treated group were headache (12.5%) and worsening of MG (11.4%), and in the placebo group, worsening of MG (20.5%) and diarrhea (10.2%).

Conclusions

Initiation of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) treatment was not superior to placebo in maintaining myasthenia gravis (MG) control during a 36-week schedule of prednisone tapering. There were no significant differences in the primary or secondary endpoints between the study groups. MMF was well tolerated and adverse events were consistent with previous studies. Experience from this large, international, multicenter, phase III study employing full MG Foundation of America guidelines will aid the design of future MG studies.
