## Question

Recommendation of dexascan

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking who should receive DEXA scans and when to repeat them. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about condition-specific baseline indications at diagnosis or before bone-toxic therapy. Then, I should verify follow-up intervals and how they vary by risk and treatment exposure. Next, I will consider site selection and technical considerations. After that, I need to integrate ancillary risk assessment and management implications. Finally, I will outline practical, condition-tailored recommendations and highlight key exceptions and caveats, while double-checking the strength and credibility of each source.

> Let me first map the highest-credibility guidance relevant to DEXA use so I do not miss core indications; I should confirm the key sources include EASL 2022 and ACG 2015 for primary sclerosing cholangitis, ESsCD 2019 for celiac disease, ACR 2017 for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, EAU 2025 for androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer, ASCO 2019 for cancer survivors, ACR/SAA/SPARTAN 2019 for axial spondyloarthritis, ICFSR 2018 for sarcopenia diagnosis, and ISCD/major society follow-up concepts on individualized testing intervals and monitoring utility [^112iJHNN] [^115yQeMb] [^1121VCQ9] [^1112Bbk5] [^111VMbxR] [^111chYeY] [^1113aC2y] [^115nW17Z] [^116AWDhR] [^116hJdot] [^113MBGmG].

> For primary sclerosing cholangitis specifically, I need to check whether baseline DEXA is universally recommended and at what follow-up cadence; EASL 2022 recommends obtaining a DEXA scan at the time of diagnosis for all PSC patients, and ACG 2015 aligns, further advising repeat screening at 2 to 4-year intervals, which provides both an initial and longitudinal framework for this high-risk population [^112iJHNN] [^115yQeMb].

> Turning to celiac disease, hold on, let me verify whether DEXA is for all or targeted subgroups; ESsCD 2019 recommends obtaining a DEXA scan at diagnosis particularly when malabsorption, high risk, long diagnostic delay, or suggestive bone manifestations are present, which implies a baseline assessment is most critical in higher-risk presentations rather than universally across all celiac patients, and this is reinforced in their broader high-risk framing as well [^1121VCQ9] [^1148Aq3f].

> For glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, I should confirm timing and population; the ACR 2017 GIOP guideline addresses initial assessment and reassessment in adults beginning or continuing long-term glucocorticoids for at least 3 months, which operationally supports obtaining baseline DEXA to stratify fracture risk and guide treatment intensity, with subsequent reassessment individualized by risk tier and therapy response as per the conditional recommendations due to evidence limitations [^1112Bbk5] [^111VMbxR].

> In men initiating androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer, I need to check whether baseline DEXA is standard and whether any interval is specified; the EAU 2025 multidisciplinary guideline recommends DEXA at initiation of long-term ADT to mitigate osseous complications, and ESMO 2020 supports monitoring with DEXA to manage treatment-induced bone loss, while a lower-credibility expert consensus suggests a pragmatic every 2-year follow-up interval, which I will treat cautiously but acknowledge as consistent with accelerated ADT-related bone loss biology [^111chYeY] [^1113aC2y] [^116yosyc] [^111FEPqU].

> For adult cancer survivors without metastases, I should confirm the threshold for testing; ASCO 2019 recommends central/axial DEXA in nonmetastatic cancer survivors who have one or more osteoporotic fracture risk factors, and it allows alternatives such as quantitative ultrasound or calcaneal DEXA only when central DEXA is unavailable or infeasible, emphasizing the preference for axial measurements when possible [^115nW17Z].

> Considering axial spondyloarthritis, I need to be precise about whether to "consider" versus "recommend"; the ACR/SAA/SPARTAN 2019 update advises considering screening for osteopenia/osteoporosis with DEXA and specifies that in adults with syndesmophytes or spinal fusion, DEXA of both the spine and hips is preferred over hip-only or non-spine sites to mitigate measurement bias from structural changes, which I should keep in mind along with common artifacts that can distort readings [^116AWDhR] [^116hJdot].

> For sarcopenia, I should verify that DEXA is being used for body composition rather than BMD alone; the ICFSR 2018 international guideline recommends DEXA to identify low lean mass as part of diagnosing sarcopenia, highlighting a distinct, composition-focused use case that complements, rather than duplicates, standard osteoporosis screening pathways [^113MBGmG].

> Next, I will synthesize timing principles; baseline DEXA at diagnosis is strongly supported in PSC, targeted at-diagnosis in higher-risk celiac disease, and at initiation of bone-toxic therapies such as long-term glucocorticoids and androgen deprivation therapy, whereas in nonmetastatic cancer survivors, DEXA is indicated when at least one clinical fracture risk factor is present, with all of these anchored in high-credibility guideline recommendations [^112iJHNN] [^115yQeMb] [^1121VCQ9] [^1112Bbk5] [^111VMbxR] [^111chYeY] [^1113aC2y] [^115nW17Z].

> Now, about repeat intervals, I need to ensure we do not overstandardize; PSC has clear 2 to 4-year follow-up guidance, ADT cohorts warrant individualized intervals based on rate of bone loss with some expert groups using every 2 years, and ISCD-aligned practice recommends that follow-up BMD testing be purpose-driven, individualized by age, baseline BMD, pharmacotherapy, and evolving clinical risk with shorter intervals for high-risk scenarios such as ongoing glucocorticoids or ADT, while observational data can help anchor expectations for untreated interval progression by T-score band even though that evidence is lower credibility and should be applied cautiously [^115yQeMb] [^111FEPqU] [^115ceMto] [^116hs7ak].

> Regarding anatomical sites and modality, let me double-check the preferred approach; central/axial DEXA of the lumbar spine and hip is preferred for diagnostic and monitoring purposes, with ASCO explicitly favoring central DEXA over peripheral tests and the axial spondyloarthritis guideline underscoring combined spine and hip acquisition in the presence of structural spinal disease, while peripheral modalities are reserved for settings where central DEXA is not available or feasible [^115nW17Z] [^116hJdot].

> Hold on, I should verify technical caveats because they can materially alter interpretation; spinal degenerative changes, orthopedic hardware, implants, hip rotation, and other artifacts can invalidate regional measurements or spuriously elevate BMD estimates, necessitating alternative site selection and careful quality review of scans before clinical decisions are made, which argues for a site-specific, artifact-aware reading strategy in conditions like axial spondyloarthritis and in postsurgical spines and hips [^115rMmQB] [^116hJdot].

> Let me integrate ancillary assessment and management implications so DEXA results are contextualized; high-credibility oncology and urology guidance emphasize integrating fracture risk factors alongside BMD when initiating or monitoring ADT, and ASCO's survivorship guidance points clinicians to use central DEXA within a broader fracture risk framework, while general bone health preventive measures such as ensuring adequate vitamin D and calcium intake in older adults are supported by national osteoporosis guidance, though these adjuncts complement rather than replace DEXA-based risk stratification [^1113aC2y] [^115nW17Z] [^112Yn4sg].

> I also need to highlight important exceptions so we do not overgeneralize; in X-linked hypophosphatemia, expert guidance recommends not obtaining routine DEXA for bone health assessment, underscoring that DEXA utility is condition specific and that measurements may not reflect disease-relevant bone pathology in certain metabolic bone disorders, which should temper "universal screening" instincts outside clearly indicated groups [^116DWmYz].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially wrote that "DEXA is a screening tool, not diagnostic", but that is not entirely accurate; while fracture risk assessment rightly integrates clinical factors, densitometric diagnostic criteria for osteoporosis are indeed defined by T-scores derived from central DEXA, so I should correct that and emphasize that DEXA provides both diagnostic thresholds and monitoring capability, with follow-up testing performed when results are likely to influence management and not to delay indicated secondary fracture prevention therapy [^115ceMto].

> Putting this into a practical, condition-focused algorithm, I would obtain DEXA at diagnosis for all patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis and repeat every 2 to 4 years, at diagnosis in celiac disease when malabsorption, long diagnostic delay, or bone-related features are present, at or just before starting long-term glucocorticoids to establish risk and guide therapy intensity, at baseline for men initiating long-term androgen deprivation therapy, and in nonmetastatic cancer survivors who have at least one osteoporotic fracture risk factor, while considering DEXA in axial spondyloarthritis and ensuring spine plus hip measurement in the presence of syndesmophytes or fusion, then individualizing repeat intervals based on baseline BMD, age, therapy, and changing risk, with shorter intervals in high-risk exposures such as ongoing glucocorticoids or ADT and longer intervals in stable, low-risk settings [^112iJHNN] [^115yQeMb] [^1121VCQ9] [^1112Bbk5] [^111VMbxR] [^111chYeY] [^1113aC2y] [^115nW17Z] [^116AWDhR] [^116hJdot] [^115ceMto] [^111FEPqU] [^116hs7ak].

> Finally, I should confirm site selection and quality safeguards in the report; central lumbar spine and hip should be the default, with explicit notation of artifacts, clear statement of least significant change for the facility, and a plan for follow-up testing only when it will change management, recognizing when to choose alternative sites or forego routine DEXA in condition-specific exceptions such as X-linked hypophosphatemia, thereby aligning technical execution with guideline intent and clinical decision-making [^115nW17Z] [^115rMmQB] [^115ceMto] [^116DWmYz].

DEXA is recommended for **women ≥ 65 years** [^notfound], **men ≥ 70 years**, and **adults ≥ 50 years with risk factors** (prior fragility fracture, glucocorticoids ≥ 3 months [^1112Bbk5], low body weight, smoking, alcohol use, rheumatoid arthritis, or secondary osteoporosis). It is also indicated at diagnosis for primary sclerosing cholangitis [^112iJHNN] and for celiac disease with malabsorption or delayed diagnosis [^1121VCQ9]. For patients on long-term glucocorticoids [^1112Bbk5], androgen deprivation [^111chYeY], or aromatase inhibitors [^115nW17Z], **obtain baseline DEXA and repeat every 1–2 years** based on risk and therapy [^115ceMto]. Routine screening is not recommended for premenopausal women or men < 50 without risk factors [^notfound]. DEXA is **safe, low-radiation, and cost-effective** for fracture risk assessment and for monitoring response to therapy.

### 2017 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis [^1112Bbk5]. Arthritis Care & Research (2017). High credibility.

The objective of this research was to develop recommendations for the prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP).

Methods: We conducted a systematic review to synthesize the evidence for the benefits and harms of GIOP prevention and treatment options. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was used to rate the quality of evidence. A group consensus process was employed to determine the final recommendations and to grade their strength. The guideline addresses initial assessment and reassessment in patients beginning or continuing long-term (≥ 3 months) glucocorticoid (GC) treatment. It also evaluates the relative benefits and harms of lifestyle modification and treatments such as calcium, vitamin D, bisphosphonate, raloxifene, teriparatide, and denosumab in the general adult population receiving long-term GC treatment, as well as in special populations of long-term GC users.

Results: Due to limited evidence regarding the benefits and harms of interventions in GC users, most recommendations in this guideline are conditional, indicating an uncertain balance between benefits and harms. Recommendations include:

- **For adults at low fracture risk**: Treat only with calcium and vitamin D.

- **For adults at moderate-to-high fracture risk**: Treat with calcium and vitamin D plus an additional osteoporosis medication, with oral bisphosphonate as the preferred option.

- **For adults in whom oral bisphosphonate treatment is not appropriate**: Continue calcium plus vitamin D but switch from an oral bisphosphonate to another antifracture medication.

The guidelines suggest continuing oral bisphosphonate treatment or switching treatment as necessary based on individual patient needs.

### Optimizing the role of androgen deprivation therapy in advanced prostate cancer: Challenges beyond the guidelines [^111FEPqU]. The Prostate (2020). Low credibility.

The risk of osteoporosis in aging men on ADT (androgen deprivation therapy) increases due to both advancing age and the suppression of testosterone and estrogen, which are both bone-protective against fracture risk. ADT has been shown to accelerate bone loss, and hypogonadism is a leading cause of osteoporosis in men within the United States. Prolonged exposure to ADT also increases fracture risk in a dose-dependent manner.

- **Bone health**: The panel reached unanimous consensus on several aspects of risk management of skeletal events with ADT: obtaining a DEXA (bone densitometry) scan and calculating a FRAX score at baseline (within 6 months of initiating ADT) and at least once every 2 years for follow-up; assessing vitamin D levels in men who are taking osteoclast inhibitors, by either the PCP or cancer care provider. All men on ADT should receive appropriate maintenance supplementation of vitamin D and calcium (not to exceed 800–1000 IU vitamin D daily after restoring vitamin D stores to normal levels and 1200 mg calcium daily), all in accordance with the NCCN guidelines on bone health for men on ADT. Likewise, the panel supported the NCCN guidelines on determining which patients are eligible for additional pharmacologic therapies (denosumab or zoledronic acid) to increase bone mineral density in men with osteoporosis, men with osteopenia, and men with an elevated risk of fracture based on personal risk factors as estimated by calculating a patient's FRAX score.

### European Society of Endocrinology and Endocrine Society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^117JUADt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

Due to the ease and convenience of testing, as well as the experience and validation, a morning serum cortisol level (measured between 8:00 and 9:00, after holding glucocorticoid dose for at least 24 hours) is the recommended test to examine the recovery of the HPA axis following glucocorticoid therapy. The test should be conducted only after reaching the range of a physiologic equivalent daily dose (e.g. prednisone 4–6 mg daily or hydrocortisone 15–25 mg total daily dose).

Several other approaches to HPA axis assessment exist, including the measurement of waking salivary cortisone, morning DHEA-S measurement, 250 µg ACTH (1–24) test, overnight metyrapone test, and insulin tolerance test. However, the literature comparing different tests for adrenal insufficiency in the context of glucocorticoid use is very limited. Importantly, test results are hardly related to clinically relevant outcomes.

Assessment should be done at least 24 hours after the last dose of glucocorticoids, excluding dexamethasone. It should be emphasized that biochemical testing for adrenal insufficiency is sensitive but not specific. Persistence of biochemical suppression or insufficient recovery of the HPA axis is a prerequisite for clinical adrenal insufficiency. Yet, even among those patients with biochemical insufficiency, the risk for clinically meaningful adrenal insufficiency and adrenal crisis remains very low, despite the high prevalence of biochemical adrenal insufficiency.

### Evaluation of evidence supporting NICE recommendations to change people's lifestyle in clinical practice: cross-sectional survey [^113EoyHC]. BMJ Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Table 1 and Figure 1 describe the evidence cited in support of the IOLI recommendations. Inter-reviewer agreement was over 92% for all judgments, with a mean of 96%. Of the 379 recommendations, 123 (32%) did not cite any supportive evidence. For 181 (48%) recommendations, the evidence cited was judged to be of questionable relevance to support a beneficial effect.

- **Types of evidence issues**:
	- 71 (19%) referred only to evidence from observational studies (e.g. people with obesity have worse outcomes than those without obesity).
	- 61 (16%) referred to evidence not directly relevant to the target population (e.g. evidence was on pregnant women while the target was all women of fertile age) or to the intervention (e.g. evidence was on intensive interventions while the recommendation was for brief advice), or the cited evidence had limited relevance to support the intended outcome (e.g. evidence suggested weight loss leads to benefits while the recommendation assumes dietary advice would cause weight loss).
	- 49 (13%) cited evidence suggesting no beneficial effect of the recommended intervention but recommended it anyway (e.g. studies of brief advice on physical activity showed no clinically relevant effect on outcomes).

- **Table 1**: Evidence cited to support 379 recommendations of individually oriented lifestyle interventions (IOLI) in 57 NICE guidelines.

### Management of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis [^112nFGF3]. Nature Reviews Rheumatology (2010). Low credibility.

Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis is a common condition that results in significant morbidity and mortality. The skeletal effects of glucocorticoids include both direct and indirect actions on bone, leading to an early, transient increase in bone resorption accompanied by a decrease in bone formation, maintained for the duration of glucocorticoid therapy. Rapid bone loss and increased fracture risk occur soon after the initiation of glucocorticoid therapy and are dose-dependent. The increase in fracture risk is partly independent of bone mineral density, probably due to changes in bone material properties and an increased risk of falling.

Bisphosphonates are the front-line choice for the prevention of fractures in glucocorticoid-treated patients, with teriparatide as the second-line option. Calcium and vitamin D supplements should be co-prescribed in the majority of individuals. Future guidelines for managing glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis should recognize the limitations of FRAX in assessing fracture risk in glucocorticoid-treated patients and should include recently approved interventions such as zoledronate and teriparatide.

### Guideline recommendations on the assessment and management of awake airway intubation: A systematic review [^111Qq7sM]. BMC Anesthesiology (2025). High credibility.

The study synthesized guidelines and identified consistent recommendations regarding awake airway intubation. Recommendations for key clinical questions were manually extracted from all included guidelines and summarized into six themes:

- **Indications for awake difficult airway intubation**: This covers when it is appropriate to perform the procedure.
- **Airway local anesthesia before awake difficult airway intubation**: Describes the use of anesthesia as a preparatory step.
- **Awake difficult airway intubation procedure**: Details the procedure itself and its implementation.
- **Checking the tube position after awake difficult airway intubation**: Involves verifying the correct placement of the tube post-procedure.
- **Management after failure of ATI**: Addresses steps to take following unsuccessful attempts.
- **Extubation procedure for ATI**: Explains the removal process of the tube post-procedure.

Guidance documents were visualized in a five-color grid to illustrate inconsistencies. Widely recommended content serves as a reference point. Guidance documents providing consistent recommendations with reference content were colored green, inconsistent ones red, and partially consistent ones yellow. Partially consistent recommendations contain elements differing from the reference content, while cells with no applicable recommendation were colored blue and gray, respectively.

All extracted recommendations were collated and grouped according to themes. The GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system was used for analysis and summary. GRADE is an evaluation system for grading the evidence of systematic reviews and clinical guidelines, assessing the strength of guideline recommendations while providing a transparent and structured framework.

### Use and safety of corticosteroid injections in joints and musculoskeletal soft tissue: Guidelines from the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, the American Academy of Pain Medicine, the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians, and the International Pain and Spine Intervention Society [^115THbhk]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Intra-articular corticosteroid (IACS) injection and peri-articular corticosteroid injection are commonly used to treat musculoskeletal conditions. Results vary by musculoskeletal region, but most studies report short-term benefit with mixed results on long-term relief. Publications showed adverse events from single corticosteroid injections. Recommended effective doses were lower than those currently used by clinicians.

- **Methods**: Development of the practice guideline for joint injections was approved by the Board of Directors of the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine and the participating societies. A Corticosteroid Safety Work Group coordinated the development of three guidelines: peripheral nerve blocks and trigger points; joints; and neuraxial, facet, and sacroiliac joint injections. The topics included safety of the technique in relation to landmark-guided, ultrasound-guided, or radiology-aided injections; effect of the addition of the corticosteroid on the efficacy of the injectate; and adverse events related to the injection. Experts on the topics were assigned to extensively review the literature and initially develop consensus statements and recommendations. A modified version of the US Preventive Services Task Force grading of evidence and strength of recommendation was followed. A modified Delphi process was adhered to in arriving at a consensus.

- **Results**: This guideline focuses on the safety and efficacy of corticosteroid joint injections for managing joint chronic pain in adults. The joints that were addressed included the shoulder, hip, and knee.

### Distinguishing ASH clinical practice guidelines from other forms of ASH clinical advice [^1172mr9Q]. Blood Advances (2024). High credibility.

The usable end products of both ASH CPGs and other forms of ASH clinical advice are recommendations. Recommendations are actionable statements intended to guide decision-making about alternative healthcare options in a specific patient population. Several different types of recommendations are recognized. ASH CPGs and other forms of ASH clinical advice differ with respect to the types of recommendations they include.

The backbone of ASH CPGs is formal recommendations. Formal recommendations are actionable statements based on systematic reviews of the evidence that name an explicit intervention and comparison and a specific population. Such recommendations include a direction and strength; the former advises an action, while the latter is related to the balance of desirable and undesirable consequences and the quality of evidence that informs the recommendation. In addition to formal recommendations, ASH CPGs may include remarks, good practice statements, research-only recommendations, and implementation considerations (defined in Lofti et al.).

In contrast to ASH CPGs, other forms of ASH clinical advice do not include formal recommendations. Instead, they consist mainly of informal recommendations. Similar to formal recommendations, informal recommendations are actionable and explicitly list a target population and intervention. They may or may not include a comparison, direction, or strength. Unlike formal recommendations, informal recommendations are not based on a systematic review of the evidence, and they do not include a rating of the quality of the evidence.

### Updated practice guideline for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [^116hs7ak]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

Repeat BMD and VFA measurements, and clinical indications: Repeat BMD testing in combination with clinical assessment of fracture risk, bone turnover markers, if available, and other factors, including height loss and trabecular bone score, can be used to determine whether treatment should be initiated in untreated individuals. The BMD repeat testing interval depends on the overall clinical need as well as the baseline value. For example, a patient taking high-dose glucocorticoids may lose bone more rapidly, particularly in the setting of cancer and active rheumatoid arthritis. Those with low BMD and rapid loss are among those at greatest risk of fracture. On the other hand, less frequent assessment may be appropriate in older individuals.

A US study of almost 5,000 postmenopausal women aged ≥ 67 years demonstrated that the average time to transition to a densitometric diagnosis of osteoporosis (T-score ≤ -2.5) was 17 years for those with a T-score > -1.5, 5 years for women with a T-score between −1.50 and −1.99, and 1 year for women with a T-score between −2.0 and −2.49 for 10% of the total population considered. These data provided some guidance on appropriate intervals for BMD testing in untreated individuals.

### Application of recommendations regarding the use of subcutaneous tumor necrosis factor inhibitors in spondyloarthritis by rheumatologists in daily practice [^116MGBQi]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to assess the implementation of European recommendations for the use of TNF inhibitors for spondyloarthritis (SpA), the rheumatologists' level of knowledge and adherence to these recommendations, and the potential barriers to their application.

Methods: A retrospective study was conducted among 42 rheumatologists who initiated a first subcutaneous TNF inhibitor for SpA in 2013 or 2014. Thirty items from national and international recommendations were categorized into three domains: indication, pretherapeutic monitoring, and management under TNF inhibitors. A standardized data collection procedure was employed to gather data from medical files, assessing the application of each recommendation. Questionnaires evaluating the knowledge, level of adherence to each recommendation, and potential barriers to their implementation were sent to the rheumatologists.

Results: On average, rheumatologists applied 60% of items from domains A (indication) and B (pretherapeutic monitoring), but less than 50% from domain C (management under TNF inhibitors). Recommendations concerning the search for previous infections and the prevention of future infections were most often applied. However, fewer than 60% of rheumatologists assessed cancer and other diseases before initiating TNF inhibitor therapy. Over 95% of rheumatologists were aware of the recommendations and exhibited a high level of adherence. Factors such as lack of time, difficulty accessing specialized consultations, and inflexible recommendations contributed to challenges in applying the guidelines.

Conclusion: Despite the high levels of knowledge and adherence to the recommendations for using TNF inhibitors, several barriers hinder their full application among rheumatologists.

### 2017 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis [^111VMbxR]. Arthritis & Rheumatology (2017). High credibility.

To develop recommendations for the prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP), a systematic review was conducted to synthesize the evidence for the benefits and harms of GIOP prevention and treatment options. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation methodology was utilized to rate the quality of evidence. A group consensus process was employed to determine the final recommendations and to grade their strength. The guideline addresses initial assessment and reassessment in patients beginning or continuing long-term (≥ 3 months) glucocorticoid (GC) treatment. It also evaluates the relative benefits and harms of lifestyle modification and of treatment with calcium, vitamin D, bisphosphonates, raloxifene, teriparatide, and denosumab in the general adult population receiving long-term GC treatment, as well as in special populations of long-term GC users.

Due to limited evidence regarding the benefits and harms of interventions in GC users, most recommendations in this guideline are conditional, reflecting an uncertain balance between benefits and harms. Recommendations include treating with only calcium and vitamin D in adults at low fracture risk; treating with calcium and vitamin D plus an additional osteoporosis medication (with oral bisphosphonates preferred) in adults at moderate-to-high fracture risk; continuing calcium plus vitamin D but switching from an oral bisphosphonate to another antifracture medication in adults for whom oral bisphosphonate treatment is not appropriate; and continuing oral bisphosphonate treatment or switching to another option as needed.

### Wound, pressure ulcer, and burn guidelines (2023)-4: Guidelines for the management of connective tissue disease/vasculitis-associated skin ulcers, third edition [^114jjgjo]. The Journal of Dermatology (2025). High credibility.

In treating skin ulcers, the selection of topical agents is crucial. Possible choices include silver sulfadiazine cream, dextranomer polymer, cadexomer iodine ointment, iodine ointment, povidone iodine sugar, trafermin (basic fibroblast growth factor) preparation, tretinoin tocopherol ointment, bucladesine sodium ointment, PGE1 (alprostadil alfadex) ointment, and bromelain ointment.

The TIME concept — Tissue, Infection, Moisture, and wound Edge — is used for treating pressure ulcers and dictates the choice of these drugs:

- **T**: Elimination of necrotic tissue with cadexomer iodine ointment.
- **I**: Control/elimination of infection with cadexomer iodine ointment, silver sulfadiazine cream, povidone iodine sugar.
- **M**: Maintaining a moist environment (control/elimination of exudates) with cadexomer iodine ointment, dextranomer polymer, povidone iodine sugar for excessive exudates; silver sulfadiazine cream for deficient exudates.
- **E**: Management of wound margins (resolution/elimination of pockets): no drugs recommended.

For moist wound healing, the following selections are made based on exudate levels:

- **Wound surfaces with appropriate/deficient exudates**: Trafermin spray, PGE1 ointment.
- **Wound surfaces with deficient exudates**: Tretinoin tocopherol ointment.
- **Wound surfaces with excessive exudates or marked edema**: Bucladesine sodium ointment.

Topical agents used for moist wound healing can also be beneficial for treating connective tissue disease/vasculitis-associated skin ulcers.

### Medical management of hyperglycemia in type 2 diabetes: A consensus algorithm for the initiation and adjustment of therapy: A consensus statement of the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [^111SjetJ]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Type 2 diabetes is an epidemic. Its long-term consequences translate into enormous human suffering and economic costs; however, much of the morbidity associated with long-term microvascular and neuropathic complications can be substantially reduced by interventions that achieve glucose levels close to the nondiabetic range. Although new classes of medications and numerous combinations have been demonstrated to lower glycemia, current-day management has failed to achieve and maintain the glycemic levels most likely to provide optimal healthcare status for people with diabetes.

### U.S. preventive services task force methods to communicate and disseminate clinical preventive services recommendations [^112oKf7T]. American Journal of Preventive Medicine (2018). High credibility.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) issues evidence-based screening and prevention recommendations. Key to this task is the dissemination and implementation of these recommendations. The Task Force has recommendations for more than 84 topics; each USPSTF Recommendation Statement includes a letter grade, a topline summary to guide clinician interpretation in practice, and a summary of gaps in evidence to help catalyze clinically relevant research.

The USPSTF aims to update existing topics regularly and considers new topics to add each year. Clearly communicating and disseminating each recommendation is a critical task to ensure maximum benefit from their use. The primary USPSTF audience is primary care clinicians. Over time, other audiences have become interested in the USPSTF, and these entities have broad and diverse needs. Consequently, this necessitates a range of communication platforms and approaches.

This includes engagement with and input from topic experts, primary care and federal partners, and the public to help shape the development of the recommendations. It also includes the engagement of partners to disseminate USPSTF recommendations, ensuring that the primary care workforce remains up-to-date on USPSTF recommendations. This paper outlines the approaches used by the USPSTF to both solicit input, such as public comment periods, and to facilitate dissemination of its recommendations to help improve the health of all Americans. This involves web-based and mobile application tools, journal publications, and annual reports to Congress.

### Systematic analysis of levels of evidence supporting American Academy of Ophthalmology preferred practice pattern guidelines, 2012–2021 [^111E5o21]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). Low credibility.

The 2021 Cataract in the Adult Eye PPP was the guideline with the greatest number of recommendations with reported LOE (n = 18). In our systematic review of this guideline, we identified 510 statements that could be considered recommendation statements. The two reviewers both identified 386 (76%) of these recommendation statements independently. Their overall percent agreement was 82%, and the kappa statistic was 0.64. Ninety-five additional statements were identified as recommendation statements by consensus after initially being included by only one reviewer. Twenty-nine statements were additionally considered recommendations by the third reviewer.

We found that 267 (52%) recommendation statements did not have any reference associated with them. For the recommendations that did have references, we reviewed the references and categorized 92 (18%) recommendations as supported by LOE I, 95 (19%) as supported by LOE II, and 56 (11%) recommendations as supported by LOE III. For the 18 statements that had reported LOE, our categorization had 100% agreement with the reported LOE.

- **Changes from prior to guidelines**: Twenty-three PPP guidelines had a prior edition (published between 2012 and 2016) available for comparison. The Adult Strabismus PPP was published for the first time in 2019. Across the 23 prior PPPs, LOE were provided for 1254 recommendations, compared with 94 (93% decrease) in editions.

Overall, the number of recommendations with LOE has decreased significantly compared to prior editions. The details of changes in the number of recommendations with LOE by subspecialty and topic can be further analyzed to understand the shift in guideline development priorities.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: Whys, whens, and hows [^111NsF98]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Low credibility.

Issues surrounding ergocalciferol use are of note for the United States, where 50,000 IU of vitamin D2 was the only high-dose preparation available by physician prescription and, therefore, ergocalciferol was widely prescribed. Now, instead, 50,000 IU of vitamin D3 is available by prescription. In addition to assay issues, the widespread use of intermittent high-dose ergocalciferol ("bolus" therapy) appears to alter vitamin D metabolism, with increased 24-hydroxylase activity. Other adverse consequences of high-dose vitamin D therapy, notably increased fall risk, are reported and have led to calls to critically assess daily vs. bolus vitamin D therapy.

To summarize, vitamins D2 and D3 are not equivalent in raising circulating 25(OH)D, and bolus dosing may have adverse effects on vitamin D metabolism and clinical outcomes. As such, it is to be expected that calls for the use of only cholecalciferol and avoidance of ergocalciferol have been and continue to be published with recent osteoporosis-treatment guidance advising cholecalciferol over ergocalciferol. Despite these recommendations, high-dose ergocalciferol remains widely prescribed in the United States.

- **Calcifediol**: Calcifediol is the intermediate metabolite between cholecalciferol and calcitriol. Several pharmacokinetic studies performed in the last four decades have demonstrated its hydrophilic properties, leading to higher solubility in organic solvents, less sequestration in adipose tissue, smaller distribution volume, and shorter half-life when compared to cholecalciferol. By virtue of its hydrophilic properties, calcifediol exhibits distinct pharmacokinetic behavior.

### CanVasc consensus recommendations for the management of antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody-associated vasculitis: 2020 update [^112bD5et]. The Journal of Rheumatology (2021). High credibility.

The Canadian Vasculitis Research Network (CanVasc) initially established recommendations in 2015 for managing antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV) in Canada. This 2020 update aims to revise these existing recommendations and introduce new ones, grounded in the latest available evidence.

- **Methods**: A needs assessment survey conducted among CanVasc members identified key questions for an updated systematic literature review. This review covered publications from May 2014 to September 2019, utilizing databases such as Medline, Embase, and Cochrane. The new and revised recommendations were crafted and categorized by evaluating the level of evidence and strength. A modified 2-step Delphi process was employed by the CanVasc working group to achieve more than 80% consensus on each recommendation's inclusion, wording, and grading.

- **Results**: The update resulted in the creation of eleven new recommendations and the revision of sixteen existing ones. Twelve original recommendations from 2015 were retained. The document elaborates on new and revised recommendations extensively. Five original recommendations were removed; four of these were incorporated into the explanatory text. Supplementary materials for practical use were also updated to align with the new recommendations.

- **Conclusion**: The 2020 updated recommendations furnish rheumatologists, nephrologists, and other specialists in Canada with enhanced management guidance for patients with AAV, drawing from evidence and consensus among Canadian experts.

### Guidelines for treating heart failure [^114pU75L]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Optimal guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure with reduced ejection fraction comprises the angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitor (sacubitril/valsartan), an evidence-based beta-blocker (bisoprolol, carvedilol, or sustained-release metoprolol), a mineralocorticoid antagonist (spironolactone or eplerenone), and a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (dapagliflozin or empagliflozin). Optimal guideline-directed medical therapy for heart failure with preserved ejection fraction comprises a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor, with emerging evidence to support the use of a mineralocorticoid antagonist and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. This review will summarize the evidence behind the guideline recommendations, the impact of newer trials on the management of patients with heart failure, and strategies for implementation into clinical practice.

The assessment of whole-body composition (WBC) by DXA enables measurement of total and regional bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD), as well as lean and fat mass (Figure 9 A and B). In order to compare results across manufacturers, in vivo cross-calibration is necessary. For cross-calibrating systems of the same manufacturer and model, an appropriate whole-body phantom may be used. One technologist can perform 10 whole-body phantom scans with repositioning. If a difference in mean fat mass or lean mass percentage greater than 2% is observed, the manufacturer should be contacted for service/correction.

### Managing bone parameters in dialysis patients: International guideline conflicts [^112Vo5R7]. Seminars in Dialysis (2007). Low credibility.

The linkage between bone parameters (calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone) and cardiovascular death in dialysis patients has led to a major resurgence in interest in this area of nephrological practice. Two major groups have recently published extensive guidelines for clinical practice in this area: the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcomes and Quality Initiative from the United States, and the Caring for Australasians with Renal Impairment group from Australia and New Zealand. There are some important differences in their recommendations, which reflect variations in local clinical practice, reimbursement systems, and interpretation of the medical literature.

- **Use of vitamin D and its analogs**: There are variations in the recommendations concerning the use of vitamin D and its analogs.

- **Use of phosphate binders**: Another area of divergence is the use of phosphate binders.

Readers of guidelines such as these need to be careful to interpret such recommendations in the context of the realities of their local clinical practice and availability of therapies.

	- We recommend that if no other upper gastrointestinal alarm symptoms or signs are reported, urgent endoscopy is only warranted in patients aged ≥ 55 years with dyspepsia with weight loss, or those aged > 40 years from an area at an increased risk of gastric cancer or with a family history of gastro-oesophageal cancer (recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: very low).

	- We recommend that non-urgent endoscopy is considered in patients aged ≥ 55 years with treatment-resistant dyspepsia or dyspepsia with either a raised platelet count or nausea or vomiting (recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: very low).

	- We recommend that urgent abdominal CT scanning is considered in patients aged ≥ 60 years with abdominal pain and weight loss to exclude pancreatic cancer (recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: very low).

	- We recommend that all other patients with dyspepsia are offered non-invasive testing for H. pylori ('test and treat') and, if infected, given eradication therapy (recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: high).

	- We recommend that successful eradication of H. pylori after 'test and treat' is only confirmed in patients with an increased risk of gastric cancer (recommendation: strong; quality of evidence: low).

	- We recommend that patients without H. pylori infection are offered empirical acid suppression therapy (recommendation: strong).

### Practical guide to glucocorticoid induced hyperglycaemia and diabetes [^114vgzQL]. Diabetes Therapy (2023). Low credibility.

Despite the wide clinical usage of glucocorticoid therapy and well-documented evidence of glucocorticoid-induced hyperglycaemia and diabetes, these complications still go under-diagnosed and under-monitored. Consensus guidelines have a strong focus on hospital inpatient management, despite widespread community use; however, clinical evidence provides pragmatic solutions for monitoring and usage in the community. The lack of early diagnosis and appropriate management is costly to both the patient in the short and long term, in addition to the health system as a whole.

### Management of osteoporosis in survivors of adult cancers with nonmetastatic disease: ASCO clinical practice guideline [^115nW17Z]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for palliative care in patients with cancer, and more specifically concerning the management of osteoporosis screening, the ASCO 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining bone mineral density testing with central/axial DEXA in patients with nonmetastatic cancer who have one or more risk factors for osteoporotic fracture. Other bone mineral density testing, such as quantitative ultrasound or calcaneal DEXA, should be obtained in settings where DEXA is not available or technically feasible.

### Systematic analysis of levels of evidence supporting American Academy of Ophthalmology preferred practice pattern guidelines, 2012–2021 [^111zVzdR]. BMC Ophthalmology (2023). High credibility.

Results

- **PPP guidelines**: Overall, levels of evidence (LOE) from 24 preferred practice pattern (PPP) guidelines published between 2017 and 2021 were abstracted. Across the 24 guidelines, the LOE (SIGN) was provided for 94 recommendations. The median number of recommendations with LOE per guideline was 1.5 (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.0 — 5.0). Of these recommendations, 83 (88%) had LOE I, 2 (2%) had LOE II, and 9 (10%) had LOE III. All LOE II and III recommendations were found in the 2017 Refractive Errors and Refractive Surgery PPP.

Among the 94 recommendations with LOE, the vast majority (98%) were for management, with only 2% for diagnosis. The number of guidelines per subspecialty area ranged from 0 to 7.

- **Note**: Neuro-ophthalmology, ocular pathology/oncology, oculoplastics/orbit, and uveitis do not have preferred practice pattern guidelines. The adult strabismus preferred practice pattern guideline was published for the first time in 2019.

The guidelines also reported recommendation strengths (GRADE) for 104 recommendations. Of these, 86 (83%) were strong recommendations, and 18 (17%) were discretionary recommendations. These recommendations included the 94 recommendations with reported LOE, where 78 (83%) were strong recommendations, and 16 (17%) were discretionary recommendations. Importantly, aside from indicating recommendation strengths, the guidelines did not clearly designate statements as recommendations.

### Yorvipath [^112C1BSi]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Adverse reactions**: Advise patients that using two YORVIPATH injections to achieve the recommended once daily dosage increases the variability of the total delivered dose, which can cause unintended changes in serum calcium levels, including hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia. Advise patients to use only one YORVIPATH injection to achieve the recommended once daily dosage [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

- **Serious hypercalcemia and serious hypocalcemia**: Advise patients taking YORVIPATH to contact their healthcare provider promptly if they develop symptoms of hypercalcemia (e.g. nausea, vomiting, constipation, lethargy, muscle weakness) or hypocalcemia, to report abrupt discontinuations in YORVIPATH dosing, and to follow recommended serum calcium monitoring [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2, 5.3)].

- **Potential risk of osteosarcoma**: Advise patients that the administration of other PTH products causes an increase in the incidence of osteosarcoma in rats. No increased risk of osteosarcoma was observed with teriparatide compared to a general population. Advise patients to promptly report clinical symptoms (e.g. persistent localized pain) and signs (e.g. soft tissue mass tender to palpation) that could be consistent with osteosarcoma [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4)].

- **Orthostatic hypotension**: When initiating YORVIPATH treatment, advise patients to be prepared to immediately sit or lie down during or after administration if they feel lightheaded or have palpitations.

### European society of endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^111CpFsb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism (2024). High credibility.

At the start of the guideline process, the working group formulated clinical questions regarding the evaluation of adrenal function and treatment of patients after long-term supraphysiologic glucocorticoid exposure. The clinical questions that formed the basis for the systematic reviews are summarized in Supplementary Table S2 (see section on Supplementary Material).

Eligible articles were required to present data on adult patients (≥ 18 years). Articles presenting data on glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency based on biochemical testing were included based on the use of the high-dose (250 μg) short ACTH (1–24) test (also referred to by brand names as Synacthen or cosyntropin test), since these tests are widely used in clinical practice. During this test, 250 μg of synthetic ACTH (ACTH (1–24), or another corticotropic agent) is administered intravenously. To determine adrenal response to synthetic ACTH, serum cortisol levels are measured 30 and 60 minutes after administration. In primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency, peak cortisol levels < 500 nmol/L (< 18.1 μg/dL), depending on the assay, are indicative of adrenal insufficiency. Since the population under study was assessed for glucocorticoid insufficiency, the definition of a positive test was based on cut-off values provided in the individual articles.

### British Society of Gastroenterology guidelines for diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis [^116yjRd7]. Gut (2025). High credibility.

- **Second-line and third-line treatments**: We recommend budesonide as an option in non-cirrhotic adult patients with significant prednisolone-associated adverse effects (AEs). The grade of evidence is moderate, and the strength of the recommendation is weak. Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is recommended for those who are intolerant of azathioprine and are actively avoiding conception. The grade of evidence is moderate, and the strength of the recommendation is weak. In patients responding inadequately to optimized azathioprine treatment, tacrolimus may be more effective as a rescue therapy, but MMF can also be considered due to its better side-effect profile. The grade of evidence is low, and the strength of the recommendation is weak. Second and third-line therapies, other than MMF and tacrolimus, require specific expertise. Specialist input should be sought before their use. The grade of evidence is low, and the strength of recommendation is strong.

- **Long-term management**: Long-term follow-up is recommended, as autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is usually a lifelong condition. The grade of evidence is moderate, and the strength of recommendation is strong. Consideration of non-invasive imaging assessment of fibrosis at intervals of 2–3 years is recommended. The grade of evidence is weak, and the strength of recommendation is low. For adults achieving complete biochemical response (CBR) after 6 months, with repeated testing 2–4 weeks later, steroids should be withdrawn slowly over 3 months. In children, low-dose steroids should be continued and discontinued only after discussion with a specialist center.

### Uptake of pharmacist recommendations by patients after discharge: Implementation study of a patient-centered medicines review service [^112duubK]. BMC Geriatrics (2023). High credibility.

The mean participant age was 83.1 years. On average, participants took 10.4 medicines and had 8.9 medical conditions per patient. Out of 100 patients, five took fewer than five regular medicines, 48 took between five and nine, and 47 took ten or more, which is classified as hyper polypharmacy. Fifty-six percent of patients were counseled in the presence of a caregiver. Of the 368 recommendations made to 100 patients/caregivers, 351 (95%) were acted on. Among those actioned, 284 (77%) were implemented, and 206 (21%) regularly taken medicines were deprescribed — 141 ceased and 65 reduced in dose.

There were medicine changes during inpatient stay unrelated to pharmacist discharge recommendations, made by treating doctors.

- **Medicines commenced**:

- **Single occurrences**: amiodarone, doxycycline, gabapentin, irbesartan, lactulose, mirabegron, morphine liquid, tamsulosin/dutasteride, temazepam, warfarin
- **Multiple occurrences**: amlodipine (4), docusate senna (17), macrogol (9), metoclopramide (2), mirtazapine (3), ondansetron (3), oxycodone (15), oxycodone/naloxone (11), paracetamol (21), tapentadol (9), vitamin D (11)

- **Medicines ceased**: allopurinol, amitriptyline, amlodipine (4), amoxicillin (3), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (7), atorvastatin (6), aspirin (4), bisoprolol

### Hemlibra [^113skZVV]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

For subcutaneous use only, the recommended loading dose is 3 mg/kg by subcutaneous injection once weekly for the first 4 weeks, followed by a maintenance dose of:

- **1.5 mg/kg once every week**
- **3 mg/kg once every two weeks**
- **6 mg/kg once every four weeks**:

The selection of a maintenance dose should be based on healthcare provider preference, with consideration of regimens that may increase patient adherence. Discontinue the prophylactic use of bypassing agents the day before starting Hemlibra prophylaxis. The prophylactic use of factor VIII (FVIII) products may be continued during the first week of Hemlibra prophylaxis.

- **Missed dose**: If a dose of Hemlibra is missed, administer as soon as possible and then resume the usual dosing schedule. Do not administer two doses on the same day to make up for a missed dose.

### Clinical practice guideline for management of osteoporosis and fracture prevention in Canada: 2023 update [^112Yn4sg]. CMAJ (2023). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for vitamin D deficiency, specifically concerning vitamin D requirements, the 2023 OC guidelines recommend advising daily supplementation of 400 IU of vitamin D in adults aged over 50 years. This is in addition to consuming vitamin D-rich foods to achieve the recommended dietary allowance of 600 IU per day for individuals aged 51–70 years and 800 IU per day for individuals aged over 70 years, as it is difficult to reach this level of intake since few foods contain vitamin D.

### European society of endocrinology and endocrine society joint clinical guideline: Diagnosis and therapy of glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency [^1174L1xv]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2024). Low credibility.

- **R 2.8**: We suggest against routinely performing a dynamic test for diagnosing adrenal insufficiency in patients tapering or stopping glucocorticoid therapy (⊕○○○).

- **Rationale**: Morning cortisol measurement can serve as a simple approach to HPA axis assessment, obviating the need for other tests in many patients (see recommendation 2.7). However, if cortisol remains indeterminate (see 2.7), dynamic testing can be considered. The decision to carry out dynamic testing should consider the test's availability, feasibility, costs, and regional accessibility. There is no evidence that a specific test in the context of glucocorticoid treatment is superior.

	- Dynamic testing options include 250 µg ACTH (1–24) and, less commonly, overnight metyrapone and insulin tolerance tests. The 250 µg ACTH (1–24) test only examines the direct response of the adrenal gland to supraphysiologic ACTH stimulation. In primary and secondary adrenal insufficiency, a peak cortisol level < 500 nmol/L (< 18.1 μg/dL), depending on assay, at 30 or 60 minutes is indicative of adrenal insufficiency. As suppression of the HPA axis subsequently results in adrenocortical atrophy with impaired cortisol response, the test may yield less results that are reliable in patients on shorter duration of glucocorticoid therapy. The overnight metyrapone stimulation test and insulin tolerance test are more labor-intensive and can be associated with significant adverse effects. They assess the entire HPA axis, but head-to-head studies comparing different dynamic tests in this patient population are lacking.

### What do clinical practice guidelines say about deprescribing? A scoping review [^115yBSTY]. BMJ Quality & Safety (2024). High credibility.

Deprescribing recommendation characteristics: The 80 guidelines contained a total of 3,569 evidence-based recommendations, of which 248 pertained to deprescribing. The median number of recommendations per guideline was 24.5 (range: 2–233), and the median number of evidence-based deprescribing recommendations per guideline was 2 (range: 0–14). On average, 7% (248/3,569) of evidence-based recommendations identified in the guidelines pertained to deprescribing. An additional 68 deprescribing good practice statements were identified, resulting in a total of 316 deprescribing recommendations. Of these, 9% (28/316) advised on when not to deprescribe.

- **Evidence classification**: The 248 evidence-based deprescribing recommendations were classified as either strong (17%) or conditional/weak (31%). Of the remainder, 113 (46%) did not specify the strength, and 17 (7%) self-described the recommendation as consensus-based. The certainty of the evidence informing these recommendations was variable, ranging from high (2%) to very low (17%), with over half (57%) not specifying the evidence certainty.

- **Language complexity and readability**: The average language complexity score was 41%, and the average reading grade of deprescribing recommendations was 17. Only one recommendation was below the recommended reading grade for the public (grade 8). Most readability scores were above 16, which are deemed 'very difficult to read'.

### Updated practice guideline for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [^115ceMto]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). High credibility.

The latest ISCD 2023 update includes several key recommendations: Follow-up BMD testing can aid in monitoring response to therapy. Follow-up BMD testing should be undertaken with clearly defined objectives and when the results are likely to influence patient management. Testing should be performed if a fracture has occurred or new risk factors have developed, but it should not delay treatment for secondary fracture prevention.

Repeat BMD testing should be used to monitor individuals prior to a temporary cessation of bisphosphonate therapy and during the period of planned interruption of treatment. These intervals must be individualized, taking into consideration an individual's age, baseline BMD, the type of pharmacological treatment, and the presence of clinical factors associated with bone loss. Shorter intervals may be required in cases associated with rapid change in bone mineral density. These include the use of certain medications such as glucocorticoids, aromatase inhibitors, androgen deprivation therapy, and osteoanabolic therapies; medical disorders like malabsorption and severe systemic inflammatory diseases; and conditions such as prolonged immobilization, bariatric surgery, and surgical menopause.

If changes in BMD fall outside the expected range for an individual patient and adequate scan quality has been confirmed, this should prompt consideration for a re-evaluation of the patient and plan of care. A DXA report, both baseline and follow-up, should state that a follow-up exam is recommended, ensuring continued management and care.

### Updated practice guideline for dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) [^115rMmQB]. European Journal of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging (2025). Low credibility.

- **Other hip artifacts**: Prior history of osteosynthesis hardware. Even after removal, sclerotic changes can remain visible in the femoral neck. Gluteal implants overlapping with bone structures. In the majority of these cases, the hip is not suitable for BMD assessment. Other factors include hip dysplasia, bone metastases, Paget's disease, incorrect ROI position of the hip region, and incorrect rotation of the femur (lesser trochanter not visible).

A limitation of DXA scans is that they are based on two-dimensional projection images that measure BMD as the mass of bone per unit area. This may underestimate true volumetric bone density in shorter individuals or overestimate it in taller adults. As a result, they do not separate the effects of true bone density (i.e.g.rams of bone per unit volume) from those of bone size.

### How do postnatal care guidelines in Australia compare to international standards? A scoping review and comparative analysis [^11789Dac]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2024). Low credibility.

Of the 10 NICE/WHO recommendations relating to the assessment of women, five recommendations (#1, 2, 5, 7, and 9) appeared frequently in Australian guidelines. However, few Australian guidelines contained these recommended practices in their entirety, each missing one or more components of a recommendation. For example, in recommendation 5, which pertains to physical assessments after 24 hours, none of the partially agreeing guidelines recommended assessing for signs and symptoms of thromboembolism, anaemia, and pre-eclampsia, while eight guidelines recommended assessing bladder and bowel function.

- **Assessment of the woman and newborn**:
	- Comparison and level of agreement between NICE/WHO recommendations and Australian postnatal guidelines.

Assessing women's emotional wellbeing (recommendation #3) was well covered and in agreement or partial agreement with 13 Australian guidelines. However, the National Guide to a Preventive Health Assessment for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People guideline recommended against universal screening for depression (as suggested by NICE and WHO) but did recommend assessing emotional well-being in women who are experiencing or at risk of family violence. Another example is recommendation 10, which advises that a GP assesses a woman 6 to 8 weeks after birth. In Australia, four guidelines recommended that the assessment be conducted by a provider other than a GP (e.g. maternal and child health nurse or obstetrician) and two guidelines recommended alternate timing.

### Adverse skeletal effects of drugs - beyond glucocorticoids [^114BNJVL]. Clinical Endocrinology (2015). Low credibility.

Osteoporotic fractures are a significant public health concern with considerable individual and societal costs. In addition to the major risk factors for osteoporotic fractures, such as low bone mineral density (BMD), age, low body weight, and a history of fractures or falls, some drugs are now recognized as important secondary risk factors for bone loss and fractures, particularly among predisposed individuals.

Currently, available data are often generated from small observational clinical studies, complicating risk assessment and the development of management guidelines. In many cases, the exposed population has a low baseline risk for fracture, and additional assessment and treatment may not be necessary.

This review focuses on drugs other than glucocorticoids that have been identified as potentially causing adverse skeletal effects, summarizing the existing evidence from preclinical and clinical studies, and suggesting recommendations for patient management.

### Using second-generation antidepressants to treat depressive disorders: A clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians [^113927Jk]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

The American College of Physicians developed this guideline to present the available evidence on the pharmacologic management of the acute, continuation, and maintenance phases of major depressive disorder, dysthymia, subsyndromal depression, and accompanying symptoms such as anxiety, insomnia, or neurovegetative symptoms by using second-generation antidepressants.

- **Methods**: Published literature on this topic was identified using MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychLit, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts from 1980 to April 2007. Searches were limited to English-language studies in adults older than 19 years. Keywords for the search included terms for depressive disorders and 12 specific second-generation antidepressants — bupropion, citalopram, duloxetine, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, mirtazapine, nefazodone, paroxetine, sertraline, trazodone, and venlafaxine — and their trade names.

- **Findings and recommendations**: This guideline grades the evidence and recommendations using the American College of Physicians clinical practice guidelines grading system.
	- **Recommendation 1**: The American College of Physicians recommends that when clinicians choose pharmacologic therapy to treat patients with acute major depression, they select second-generation antidepressants based on adverse effect profiles, cost, and patient preferences (Grade: strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence).
	- **Recommendation 2**: The American College of Physicians recommends clinicians assess patient status, therapeutic response, and adverse effects regularly.
