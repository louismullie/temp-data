## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to approach allergy testing — when to test and how to perform it in line with guidelines. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the foundational role of history and pretest probability. Then, I should verify indications for testing and when to defer. Next, I will consider modality selection by suspected allergy type and how to conduct standardized testing. After that, I will interpret results in context, including post-anaphylaxis timing. Finally, I should ensure special populations and systems issues are addressed, communicate results clearly with delabeling where appropriate, and highlight key pitfalls to avoid.

> Let me first confirm the core principle before any test ordering: sensitization on a test does not equal clinical allergy, so a detailed, exposure-linked history is the indispensable starting point and determines whether testing is warranted; indiscriminate broad panels inflate false positives, increase cost, and lead to unnecessary avoidance, so I need to ensure testing is hypothesis-driven and history-concordant [^116yzMZG] [^114ft5BY] [^113EfEDA] [^116pA188].

> I need to check the precise indications for testing and when to defer; testing is appropriate when the diagnosis is uncertain, when results will target therapy such as immunotherapy, or when empiric treatment fails, whereas a history inconsistent with allergy generally means do not test and consider a one-step amoxicillin challenge if reassurance is needed for penicillin delabeling; wait, I almost said we must delay all testing six weeks after anaphylaxis, but hold on, practices vary and evidence is limited, with about 40% of fellowship directors delaying some testing in the first six weeks for concern about false negatives, so I should individualize timing based on risk and clinical urgency [^114H12rS] [^117RcH4t] [^113RccPm] [^114hFX4n].

> For suspected IgE-mediated food allergy, let me think about first-line modality; guidelines favor skin prick testing as initial evaluation, with serum specific IgE and component testing like Ara h 2 considered when SPT is unavailable, contraindicated, or to refine risk, and I should remember modern assays quantify down to 0.1 kUA/L so older 0.35 cutoffs are outdated; hmm, wait a minute, I almost considered intradermal food testing for added sensitivity, but I should correct myself because intradermal testing for food has high false positives and increased risk and should be avoided, and when history and testing disagree or diagnosis confirmation is needed, the reference standard remains a supervised oral food challenge [^115Z4Kfp] [^112nknvE] [^113BGfEH] [^114ft5BY] [^115tkK4Y] [^117Pwf93].

> I should confirm quantitative interpretation nuances; for some foods, SPT wheal sizes carry useful predictive cut points in context, such as egg with weal size ≥ 3 mm typically supportive with a compatible history and cow's milk with thresholds around ≥ 5 mm in older infants and ≥ 2 mm in younger infants, yet these values complement but do not replace clinical correlation and may vary by extract and age [^114ZUwkm] [^115RvxXs].

> Turning to drug allergy, I will now examine risk-stratified pathways; for low-risk histories, a direct 1- or 2-step drug challenge is preferred and safe, improving access to first-line antibiotics, whereas for high-risk IgE-mediated penicillin histories or recent anaphylaxis, penicillin skin testing is appropriate given its high negative predictive value and should be followed by challenge if negative; I should also verify cross-reactivity concerns by testing and, when needed, challenging to clarify β-lactam core versus side-chain sensitization, recognizing evolving evidence that side chains drive most cross-reactivity and that cefazolin often does not cross-react with other β-lactams, and I must not forget that drug challenge remains the gold standard for confirming or excluding allergy [^117KHdyb] [^116p3Y5r] [^1135ZxjZ] [^1151qUXe] [^1122ipg2] [^113Gvo9M] [^114fcYAK].

> But wait, I should also cover delayed drug reactions; when the phenotype suggests delayed T cell–mediated hypersensitivity, patch testing and delayed intradermal testing, interpreted alongside history and morphology, can increase culprit identification, although sensitivity remains imperfect and protocol standardization is essential for reproducibility [^1151qUXe].

> For allergic rhinitis and asthma with a consistent history, I should confirm sensitization with either SPT or specific IgE to relevant aeroallergens, particularly when diagnosis is uncertain, when treatment response is suboptimal, or when immunotherapy is contemplated; hold on, let me verify that both pulmonary and allergy parameters align on this approach, which they do, with emphasis on matching tests to history to avoid spurious positives [^115pTW3p] [^116NLaE6] [^114H12rS].

> In atopic dermatitis, I need to ensure I do not overtest; routine allergy testing is not recommended without features suggestive of immediate reactions, though in children under five with moderate-to-severe disease persisting despite optimized care or with a reliable immediate reaction history, selective food testing can be considered, and for chronic eczematous dermatitis or suspected allergic contact dermatitis, patch testing is indicated, with attention to potential suppression by topical or systemic immunosuppressants [^111Ussj6] [^113P9RvJ] [^113H8Ahs].

> For stinging insect hypersensitivity, I should double-check that candidates for venom immunotherapy have serum venom-specific IgE testing performed, and if initial skin or serum tests are negative despite a clear systemic sting history, repeating or augmenting testing with in vitro assays is advised to avoid false reassurance [^114p8EcA] [^117HVXcf] [^115p2x7C].

> Next, I should review how to conduct tests; skin testing must be performed by trained personnel using standardized extracts, with quantitative result expression to enable interpretation by others, while in vitro testing should use validated platforms such as ImmunoCAP, Immulite, or HYTEC, and in complex food allergy cases, component-resolved diagnostics can improve accuracy, though protocols and communication should be standardized to optimize understanding and downstream care [^114ke6iU] [^1151qUXe] [^111x4Mg1] [^117Pwf93] [^1127rYZt] [^113CELr7].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions when interpreting results; a positive SPT or sIgE indicates sensitization, not necessarily clinical reactivity, and a negative test usually lowers the probability substantially but must be interpreted in light of timing after anaphylaxis and test limitations, while Bayesian reasoning using pretest probability and likelihood ratios can refine post-test probability and guide the need for an oral food challenge, and importantly, neither SPT wheal size nor sIgE level should be used alone to predict future reaction severity [^116yzMZG] [^113RccPm] [^115HTUGD] [^112TAh8P] [^116yzMZG].

> Now, I should consider special settings and populations; in primary care, many tests can be ordered appropriately, but limited access to SPT and interpretation expertise can be barriers, particularly for older adults, while in infants and young children, testing is appropriate whenever the history warrants it and evolving early-introduction practices have increased testing rates, and in chronic rhinosinusitis or recurrent acute rhinosinusitis, allergy and immune function testing may be considered during evaluation [^114m6EA6] [^116pA188] [^1137h9bX] [^11667FhA] [^115BnYFU].

> I should confirm the downstream communication and stewardship steps; standardized testing protocols and clear written result explanations markedly improve patient understanding and appropriate antibiotic prescribing, negative drug evaluations should prompt delabeling to restore first-line options, and penicillin allergy testing is generally cost-saving across inpatient and outpatient settings, while for confirmed allergies we must educate on avoidance, provide emergency action plans, and consider immunotherapy where indicated [^1127rYZt] [^116p3Y5r] [^116kHFz7] [^115p2x7C].

> Before finishing, let me reconsider common pitfalls so I do not miss them; do not use unproven diagnostics such as IgG panels, hair analysis, electrodermal testing, applied kinesiology, or similar alternatives for IgE-mediated food allergy, do not rely on total IgE to decide whether to order specific IgE, and do not order broad panels without clinical justification, and if I started to think a big screening panel might be efficient, I should stop and refocus on the history-driven shortlist instead [^112nknvE] [^111qGqSc] [^113EfEDA].

> In summary, I need to ensure a disciplined pathway: history to set pretest probability, selective test ordering matched to the suspected allergy endotype, standardized performance of tests, context-aware interpretation, and then a clear clinical decision such as supervised challenge, delabeling, targeted therapy, or immunotherapy, all while maintaining rigorous communication and safety planning for patients at risk of anaphylaxis [^112F2tg3] [^113hhSRo].

Allergy testing identifies allergen sensitization [^111x4Mg1] and informs diagnosis and management; however, **testing must be guided by clinical history** to avoid misinterpretation and unnecessary avoidance [^112F2tg3] [^116n7b8a]. The main methods — skin prick testing (SPT), serum-specific IgE, and oral food or drug challenges — each have specific indications and limitations [^115tkK4Y].

- **SPT is first-line for IgE-mediated allergy** [^115Z4Kfp] (foods, aeroallergens, venoms) [^115pTW3p] due to high sensitivity and rapid results, but false positives occur and results must match clinical context [^116yzMZG].
- **Serum-specific IgE is used when SPT is contraindicated** or unavailable, or for complex cases [^1117TTvA]; it detects sensitization [^114ft5BY] but does not confirm clinical allergy [^112F2tg3].
- **Oral food and drug challenges are the gold standard** [^115tkK4Y] [^114fcYAK] for confirming or excluding allergy when history and tests are inconclusive, but require specialist supervision due to reaction risk [^117Ned1c].

Avoid **testing without suggestive symptoms**, and interpret results within the **clinical history** to prevent overdiagnosis and unnecessary avoidance [^111Ussj6] [^116n7b8a] [^112F2tg3].

### History and utility of specific IgE cutoff levels: What is the relevance for allergy diagnosis [^114ft5BY]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2023). Low credibility.

Allergy is defined clinically by symptoms on allergen exposure. A patient is considered sensitized when allergen-specific IgE (sIgE) antibodies can be detected in serum or plasma, or a skin test result is positive, even if no clinical reaction has been experienced. Sensitization should be regarded as a requisite and a risk factor for allergy, but it is not synonymous with an allergy diagnosis. To provide a correct allergy diagnosis, test results regarding allergen-sIgE must always be considered in view of the patient's case history and clinical observations.

Correct assessment of a patient's sensitization to specific allergens relies on the use of accurate and quantitative methods for the detection of sIgE antibodies. The evolution of sIgE immunoassays toward higher analytical performance and the use of different cutoff levels in the interpretation of test results sometimes cause confusion. Earlier versions of sIgE assays offered a limit of quantitation of 0.35 kilounits of sIgE per liter (kU A /L), which also became an established cutoff level for a positive test result in the clinical use of the assays. SIgE assays are capable of reliably measuring sIgE levels as low as 0.1 kU A /L and can demonstrate sensitization in cases in which previous assays could not.

When the outcome of sIgE test results is evaluated, it is critically important to distinguish between the analytical data as such and their clinical interpretation. Even though sIgE may be present in the absence of symptoms of allergy, available information suggests that sIgE concentrations between 0.1 kU A /L and higher levels are significant for clinical interpretation.

### Outcomes from an inpatient beta-lactam allergy guideline across a large US health system [^116p3Y5r]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2019). High credibility.

Beta-lactam antibiotic allergies, reported by up to 15% of hospitalized patients, impact acute-care antibiotic prescribing. Cephalosporins, antibiotics important to the treatment of common inpatient infections, are inconsistently prescribed to patients reporting penicillin allergies despite low cross-reactivity. Alternatives to β-lactam antibiotics may be less effective and can lead to adverse sequelae for patients, most notably healthcare-associated infections such as Clostridioides difficile infection.

Most patients with a documented penicillin allergy do not have clinically significant hypersensitivity and can be safely treated with penicillins and other β-lactams. Although penicillin allergy evaluation is encouraged by antibiotic stewardship guidelines, penicillin skin testing (PST) is operationally challenging in acute-care settings. Furthermore, many of the antibiotics generally used in hospitalized patients following a negative PST can be administered safely without preceding PST with a full-dose or test-dose challenge.

The Partners HealthCare System (PHS) guideline for inpatients with β-lactam allergy histories is an antibiotic stewardship tool that includes penicillin and cephalosporin hypersensitivity pathways that direct PST when institutionally available and needed (i.e. patients reporting IgE-mediated allergy symptoms to a penicillin who require a penicillin or cross-reactive cephalosporin), but it encourages direct full-dose and test-dose (i.e. standardized 2-step graded) drug challenges. Prior to this study, our results demonstrated that the guideline safely increased the use of preferred antibiotics in patients with reported β-lactam allergies.

### Infant allergy testing and food allergy diagnoses before and after guidelines for early peanut introduction [^1137h9bX]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2021). High credibility.

A landmark 2015 trial on early exposure to peanuts led to expert recommendations for screening and early peanut introduction in high-risk (severe eczema and/or egg allergy) infants, but the impact of this paradigm shift on allergy testing and diagnosis is unknown.

- **Objective**: We assessed the effects of the Learning Early About Peanut Allergy (LEAP) trial and guideline publications on allergy testing and food allergy diagnoses in infants.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective cohort study, deidentified administrative health claims from a commercial and Medicare advantage claims database were used. Infants with at least one year of continuous coverage were selected using newborn codes for birth hospitalizations from January 2010 to June 2018. Interrupted time series models were used to compare the prevalence of allergy testing before and after LEAP publication in February 2015 and formal guideline publication in January 2017.

- **Results**: For 487,533 included infants, allergy testing increased after LEAP (risk ratio [RR]: 1.11 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.07–1.15]) and guidelines (1.21 [1.18–1.23]). This increase of testing was also seen in infants not considered high risk, both after LEAP (1.12 [1.08–1.17]) and guidelines (1.20 [1.16, 1.23]). For first-time allergy tests, the post-guideline median number of allergens tested was 9 for serum tests and 10 for skin tests. Post-guidelines, there was a significant increase in the diagnosis of peanut (RR: 1.08 [1.00, 1.16]), egg (1.12 [1.05, 1.20]), and other food allergies (excluding milk) (1.22 [1.14, 1.31]).

### Rationale for specific allergen testing of patients with asthma in the clinical pulmonary office setting [^116NLaE6]. Chest (2015). High credibility.

Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects an estimated 25 million people in the United States. In 70% to 90% of cases, asthma is associated with IgE-mediated mechanisms, which have proved central to allergen-induced inflammation in preclinical and clinical models. The importance of IgE levels in patients with moderate to severe asthma has been confirmed in randomized controlled studies with a targeted IgE blocker. Advances in laboratory methods to detect and quantify allergen-specific IgE antibodies have allowed for a quick and easy diagnosis of allergic IgE-mediated sensitivities in the office. Pulmonologists tend to order in vitro tests to measure allergen-specific IgE rather than perform allergen skin testing, which is seen as the purview of allergists. This article reviews the importance of allergen testing in patients with asthma — whether by skin testing or by in vitro methods — and highlights the advantages, limitations, and interpretation of results derived from each method. Additionally, this article includes suggested documentation and administrative details for physician reporting in the office setting.

### Biomarkers for diagnosis and prediction of therapy responses in allergic diseases and asthma [^113aGXy7]. Allergy (2020). Low credibility.

Modern healthcare requires a proactive and individualized response to diseases, combining precision diagnosis and personalized treatment. The approach to patients with allergic diseases includes novel developments in personalized medicine, disease phenotyping and endotyping, and the development and application of reliable biomarkers. A detailed clinical history and physical examination, followed by the detection of IgE immunoreactivity against specific allergens, still represents the state of the art. However, further emphasis is now placed on optimizing diagnostic and therapeutic standards.

Numerous studies have investigated biomarkers of allergic diseases, including asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, food allergy, urticaria, and anaphylaxis. Various biomarkers have been developed through omics technologies, some of which lead to a better classification of distinct phenotypes or endotypes. The introduction of biologicals into clinical practice increases the need for biomarkers for patient selection, prediction of outcomes, and monitoring to enable adequate choices regarding the duration of these costly and long-lasting therapies.

Escalating healthcare costs, alongside questions about the efficacy of the management of allergic diseases, demand further development of a biomarker-driven approach. This review covers biomarkers in the diagnosis and treatment of asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis, viral infections, chronic rhinosinusitis, food allergy, drug hypersensitivity, and allergen immunotherapy.

### Recommendations for the allergy management in the primary care [^116pA188]. Allergy (2014). Low credibility.

The majority of patients seeking medical advice for allergic diseases are first seen in a primary care setting. Correct diagnosis, with identification of all offending allergens, is an absolute prerequisite for appropriate management of allergic disease by the general practitioner. Allergy diagnostic tests recommended for use in primary care are critically reviewed in accordance with the significant workload in a primary care setting. Simplified pathways for recognition and diagnosis of allergic diseases are proposed, which should be further adapted to local (national) conditions.

### Delabeling, safety, and impact of β-lactam allergy testing: A systematic review [^116ACwKy]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2023). Low credibility.

To our knowledge, this study is the most comprehensive review of the existing evidence base concerning the performance and safety of penicillin allergy testing through all its stages. It demonstrates that the incidence of anaphylaxis due to provocation testing is low; however, the data supporting this is incomplete. Additionally, there is a lack of data regarding the follow-up of patients after penicillin allergy testing and whether the work done in the allergy clinics translates into real-world settings.

Our systematic review and attempts at meta-analysis demonstrated that the evidence base in β-lactam allergy delabeling is poor. From the large number of studies initially identified, only 15 were clearly identified as having a low risk of bias across all aspects of the study, and there was a high number of studies with missing or incompletely reported data. Moreover, there were no randomized controlled studies of penicillin delabeling.

Of the studies identified, only one performed direct provocation testing on participants regardless of skin testing results. Therefore, we cannot comment on the utility of skin testing in identifying those more likely to react during direct provocation testing, as the positive and negative predictive values of skin testing cannot be appropriately assessed. This is significant when considering the costs and time associated with specialized skin testing for β-lactam allergy, including both the time and expense required for training clinical staff appropriately and the expense of minor and major determinants.

### Current practices in delaying testing for IgE-mediated food allergy after anaphylaxis [^113RccPm]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2022). Low credibility.

General recommendations for delaying allergy testing, especially skin testing, in the weeks following anaphylaxis have been proposed due to concerns about false-negative results. However, no specific guidelines exist to aid clinicians in deciding when to perform postanaphylactic food allergy testing and which test to use. The practices of allergists regarding a delay in testing for food allergy after anaphylaxis are unknown.

- **Objective**: We aimed to quantify the use of different approaches to postanaphylactic food allergy testing among allergists across the United States.

- **Methods**: A clinical scenario was presented to 82 allergy and immunology fellowship program directors via email survey. They were asked whether they avoid skin prick and/or blood-specific IgE testing in a child in the six weeks following suspected food-induced anaphylaxis due to concern for false-negative results.

- **Results**: The survey response rate was 33%. Of the 27 respondents, 4 (14.8%) avoid both blood and skin testing, 7 (25.9%) avoid skin testing only, and 16 (59.3%) do not avoid any testing.

- **Conclusion**: Given the paucity of published evidence, there exists a spectrum of opinions regarding testing in the weeks following food-induced anaphylaxis. About 40% of the allergy and immunology fellowship program directors in the United States who responded to the survey in this study avoid some allergy testing in the first six weeks after food-induced anaphylaxis owing to concern for false-negative results.

### Bsaci guideline for the diagnosis and management of pollen food syndrome in the UK [^112y785N]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for pollen-food allergy syndrome, more specifically in relation to skin prick tests, BSACI 2022 guidelines recommend obtaining allergy tests only for specifically reported triggers. These include:

- **Raw fruits and vegetables**: A positive prick-to-prick skin test using raw/unpeeled foods suggests pollen-food allergy syndrome (PFAS). Test for sensitization to non-specific lipid-transfer proteins if severe or atypical reactions to fruits or composite dishes are reported.

- **Soya products**: A positive prick-to-prick skin test to soya milk, along with a history of reactions to soya milk but not to soy-containing foods, suggests PFAS. Test for sensitization to the Gly m 4 - PR10 allergen and other soya allergens, including Gly m 5, 6, and 8, if the test is positive but reactions are severe or reported to occur with all soy-containing foods.

- **Hazelnut**: A positive skin prick test to hazelnut and a negative prick-to-prick skin test to roasted hazelnut confirm a diagnosis of PFAS. Test for sensitization to the hazelnut PR10 allergen Cor a 1 and seed storage proteins, including Cor a 9 and Cor a 14, if the roasted hazelnut prick-to-prick skin test is positive but the history strongly suggests PFAS. It is important to recognize that some hazelnut skin prick test extracts are enriched with Cor a 1 but can be used if the prick-to-prick skin test is not available, provided a positive test is interpreted with caution and in conjunction with the symptom history.

- **Peanut, walnut, almond, Brazil nut**: A negative skin prick test and typical PFAS symptoms confirm a diagnosis of pollen-food allergy syndrome (PFAS).

### Factors associated with aeroallergen testing among adults with asthma in a large health system [^114m6EA6]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2023). Low credibility.

We found that having at least one allergy/immunology visit during the study period was the strongest predictor of receiving testing in the multivariable adjusted analysis. However, it is important to note that we did not count successful referrals from primary care to asthma specialist clinics, which may represent guideline-concordant care. Regardless, our finding that 56.2% of patients in the cohort (17,305 of 30,775) had primary care visits only and were categorized as not receiving testing, despite the fact that any Penn Medicine provider can order serum aeroallergen testing without consulting an asthma specialist, illustrates the low rate of testing or referrals for testing in our primary care practices.

The reasons for this low rate may include lack of availability of skin prick testing in primary care practices, time constraints, lack of knowledge of the US asthma guidelines, and inexperience with interpreting allergy test results among primary care providers. Age was another important factor, with older age associated with lower odds of receiving testing. The COVID-19 pandemic may have also contributed to the low rate, as test rates declined after the March 17, 2020 lockdown date in Philadelphia.

Consistent with our expectations based on clinical indication, in the adjusted analysis for the outcome of receiving testing, patients with more severe and/or uncontrolled asthma, including those with prescriptions for multiple controller medications or asthma ED visits in the prior year, were more likely to receive testing. We also found that most aeroallergen tests were ordered…

### National survey of United Kingdom paediatric allergy services [^112VnWyC]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

All services offer specific IgE testing, and 95% (147/154) undertake skin prick testing. Component resolved diagnostics (CRD) is offered by 71% (89/126) of secondary services and 89% (25/28) of tertiary services. Intradermal testing, exhaled nitric oxide, spirometry, and ISAC panels are more frequently offered at tertiary centres. Patch testing for foods is offered in five allergy services, two tertiary and three secondary.

Logistics of skin prick testing, including staff undertaking it, allergens tested, products used, and technical aspects of skin prick test interpretation, are reviewed in detail in the Supplementary Appendix.

- **Intradermal testing**: Of the 25 services offering intradermal testing to paediatric allergy patients, six are secondary and 19 are tertiary services. Intradermal testing is most commonly offered to local anaesthetic agents (5 secondary, 19 tertiary), general anaesthetics (2 secondary, 14 tertiary), and antibiotics (3 secondary, 14 tertiary). Wasp and bee venom intradermal testing are offered by 13 services (all tertiary). Intradermal testing to other drugs was listed by three tertiary services and to chlorhexidine by one tertiary service.

### Making the most of in vitro tests to diagnose food allergy [^115HTUGD]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2017). Low credibility.

- **Clinical reasoning to diagnose food allergy**: The tests available for routine use in the clinic can vary. Some practices use mainly skin prick tests (SPT), others mainly specific IgE (sIgE), and others both. sIgE to allergen components is used in most specialist centers, and the basophil activation test (BAT) is becoming increasingly used clinically. The other tests described in the previous section are reserved for use in the research setting, namely, peptide microarrays and T-cell assays.

- **Interpretation of allergy test results**: The ultimate goal of the allergy test result is to determine the probability of clinical allergy; this is then used to decide whether an oral food challenge (OFC) is warranted. The probability of clinical allergy depends first and foremost on the clinical history and secondarily on the allergy test result. For example, if a patient consumes age-appropriate amounts of the food regularly without developing any symptoms, the probability of having food allergy (FA) is negligible, regardless of the allergy test results. Such patients should, in fact, not be tested as a false-positive result could be confusing for the patient and lead to unnecessary food avoidance.

	- The clinical history provides information that enables the clinician to establish a pretest probability of FA, which will be taken into account to determine the probability of clinical allergy for a given allergy test result, that is, the post-test probability. This reasoning is best described using nomograms that use likelihood ratios to calculate the post-test probability based on a given pretest probability. Likelihood ratios have the advantage of not depending on the specific values of the tests.

### Diagnostic accuracy, risk assessment, and cost-effectiveness of component-resolved diagnostics for food allergy: A systematic review [^117Pwf93]. Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review analyzing the evidence on the diagnostic accuracy of component-resolved diagnostics (CRD) for a range of food allergies. The strengths of this study include the use of a highly sensitive search strategy with no language restrictions, which allowed for a comprehensive literature search across several databases and clinical trial registries. The inclusion criteria for this review were carefully selected to provide clinically relevant information. Similar work in the field, including a RAND report and a systematic review by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Guidelines Group, was used as a basis for the inclusion criteria of this review.

Furthermore, the internal validity of the studies included in this review was strong, as they all used double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC) as the reference standard in at least 50% of participants. A limitation of this review is the large degree of heterogeneity between studies that met the inclusion criteria, in terms of the components tested, the particular CRD assay employed, and the cutoff values used, which prevented a quantitative synthesis of data. Additionally, we acknowledge that food allergies other than the ones we focused on are becoming increasingly important. As our search strategy was broadly formulated, we were able, in response to expert peer-review feedback, to check for any other potentially relevant studies for other foods. However, we were unable to find any such studies.

### Updating allergy and/or hypersensitivity diagnostic procedures in the WHO ICD-11 revision [^117XzUrX]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2016). Low credibility.

The classification of allergy and/or hypersensitivity conditions for the World Health Organization (WHO) International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-11 provides the appropriate corresponding codes for allergic diseases, assuming that the final diagnosis is correct. This classification should be linked to in vitro and in vivo diagnostic procedures. Considering the impact on our specialty, we decided to review the codification of these procedures into the ICD to establish a baseline and to suggest changes and/or submit new proposals.

For this purpose, we prepared a list of the relevant allergy and/or hypersensitivity diagnostic procedures that healthcare professionals manage daily. This list was based on the main guidelines, selecting all applicable and relevant corresponding terms from the ICD-10 (2015 version) and the ICD-11 β phase foundation (June 2015 version). More than 90% of the specific and essential diagnostic procedures currently used by the allergist community daily are missing. We observed that some concepts commonly used by the allergist community are not fully recognized by other specialties. The entire scheme and the correspondence in the ICD-10 (2015 version) and ICD-11 foundation (June 2015 version) provided us with a comprehensive view of the missing or imprecise terms and how they are scattered in the ICD-11 framework, allowing us to submit new proposals to increase the visibility of allergy and/or hypersensitivity conditions and diagnostic procedures.

### The quality of paediatric asthma guidelines: Evidence underpinning diagnostic test recommendations from a meta-epidemiological study [^1112ZpEA]. Family Practice (2024). Low credibility.

- **Selection of diagnostic tests related to primary care**: A list of included diagnostic tests across all relevant CPGs was provided to two GPs who work within the primary author's research department and practice in the United Kingdom. They independently identified which tests could be requested in the primary care setting from those only accessible in specialist care. Interrater agreement between the two GPs was 76%. A third GP resolved any disagreements. The list of included and excluded diagnostic tests was provided to four other GPs who practice in different parts of the United Kingdom, and they unanimously agreed on its validity.

- **Assessment of quality of evidence**: We examined the evidence underpinning recommendations for diagnostic tests identified by the GPs. Supporting references could include other guidelines, evidence syntheses, and primary studies. The full texts of referenced studies supporting each guideline recommendation were identified from Medline and Embase searches. If no studies supported a guideline recommendation and it was not explicitly stated that the recommendation was based on expert opinion, we contacted the author organization for clarification.

Two reviewers independently appraised the supporting studies for each recommendation and assessed their quality using GRADE, the most widely adopted tool for grading the quality of evidence supporting guideline recommendations. Disagreements were resolved by discussion and a third author if required. While GRADE assessments are typically tailored towards intervention outcomes, we used the guidance for performing GRADE.

### Standardized testing and written communication improve patient understanding of beta-lactam allergy testing outcomes: A multicenter, prospective study [^1127rYZt]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2022). High credibility.

Standardizing testing protocols and the written communication of testing results improved participant understanding of their allergy status after beta-lactam delabeling from 54% concordance with the clinical team to 91.6% and, consequently, may change future antibiotic prescribing.

The focus of studies looking at delabeling practices has long concentrated on methods of testing, including skin testing regimens and provocation test practices. Few studies have reported how these practices translate beyond the allergy clinic or how patient understanding is affected after testing. Of 285 publications identified as examining beta-lactam delabeling, only 3 addressed participants' understanding of the testing results afterwards. In these articles, 19.4% to 57.9% of delabeled participants considered themselves allergic to penicillin even after testing. Previous studies have also examined risk-stratifying patients to apply testing in a more streamlined manner. The focus on risk assessment and testing procedures is understandable given the known barriers to testing, including limited facilities and the time-intensive nature of the procedure for both clinician and patient. However, the importance of post-test care and communication may be underestimated.

When comparing the two phases of our study, more standardized testing regimes did not result in significantly different testing results. There were comparable rates of positivity across all forms of testing between the two phases. However, there was a difference in the rate of delabeling, which may be partly attributed to differences in age cohorts.

### Practical aspects of allergy-testing [^1163XCVD]. Paediatric Respiratory Reviews (2003). Low credibility.

Allergy-testing is a prerequisite for specific allergy treatment, including specific allergen avoidance measures, relevant pharmacotherapy, and specific allergy vaccination. All children with persistent or severe possible "allergic symptoms" or those with a need for continuous treatment should be tested, irrespective of the child's age. Allergy testing includes a careful case history and a determination of IgE sensitisation by skin prick test or the measurement of allergen-specific IgE in serum by standardised and validated methods.

The diagnosis of food allergy cannot usually be based solely on the case history and IgE sensitisation; the diagnosis has to be confirmed by controlled food elimination and food challenge procedures. The diagnosis of inhalant allergic disease requires only confirmatory nasal, conjunctival, or bronchial challenges in equivocal cases or before specific allergy treatment, such as extensive allergen avoidance measures or allergy vaccination.

### Skin testing [^114ke6iU]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2006). Low credibility.

To provide readers with a relevant review of the literature regarding skin testing in the allergist's office, a PubMed search for the years 1970 through 2005 was performed using the following keywords: allergy skin testing, skin prick testing, and intradermal skin testing.

- **Study selection**: Articles that highlighted aspects of sentinel to clinical allergists' use of skin testing in the office, such as methods of skin testing, intradermal versus skin prick testing, skin test devices, and methods of expressing skin test results, were selected for further review.

- **Results**: Skin testing remains the central test to confirm an allergic response. It is minimally invasive and, when performed correctly, has good reproducibility. Results are easily quantifiable and correlate well with end organ challenge. It is imperative, however, that technicians who perform the skin tests and the clinicians who order or interpret these tests understand the characteristics of the specific tests they are administering. It is also important for the clinician to express skin test results in a manner that allows easy interpretation by another physician.

- **Conclusions**: Allergists must consider controllable variables that affect skin test results and their interpretation. When not considered, these variables may be responsible for some of the inaccuracies associated with allergy skin testing.

### Food allergies: Detection and management [^116tYPTg]. American Family Physician (2008). Low credibility.

Family physicians play a central role in the suspicion and diagnosis of immunoglobulin E-mediated food allergies; they are also critical in redirecting the evaluation for symptoms that patients are falsely attributing to allergies. Although any food is a potential allergen, more than 90 percent of acute systemic reactions to food in children occur from eggs, milk, soy, wheat, or peanuts. In adults, these reactions are commonly caused by crustaceans, tree nuts, peanuts, or fish.

The oral allergy syndrome is more common than anaphylactic reactions to food, but its symptoms are transient and limited to the mouth and throat. Skin-prick and radioallergosorbent tests for particular foods have about an 85 percent sensitivity and 30 to 60 percent specificity. Intradermal testing has a higher false-positive rate and greater risk of adverse reactions; therefore, it should not be used for initial evaluations. The double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge remains the most specific test for confirming a diagnosis.

Treatment involves recognition and avoidance of the responsible food. Patients with anaphylactic reactions need emergent epinephrine and instruction in self-administration in the event of inadvertent exposure. Antihistamines can be used for more minor reactions.

### Skin testing as a biomarker in drug allergy [^1151qUXe]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2023). High credibility.

Despite the significant negative impact that drug allergies can have on patient care, the diagnosis is largely based on clinical history, with limited diagnostic tests available at the time of a reaction. Biomarkers are needed to improve diagnosis and identification of the culprit medication. Skin testing serves as the most useful biomarker for both immediate- and delayed-type reactions; however, it is limited by its low sensitivity. To enhance its accuracy and reproducibility, a standardized procedure must be employed.

For immediate-type reactions, penicillin skin testing is the most extensively studied. It can be used in patients with a history of anaphylaxis, recent immunoglobulin E-mediated reactions, or for those at significant risk if a reaction were to occur, such as during pregnancy. Skin testing is also crucial in cases of allergy to platinum agents, allowing for the continuation of first-line therapy.

For delayed-type reactions, patch testing and delayed intradermal testing, when used in conjunction with clinical history, can improve the identification of the culprit medication depending on the reaction type. Other biomarkers, including in vitro testing for specific immunoglobulin E, basophil activation test, lymphocyte transformation test, ELISpot, and genetic factors that increase the likelihood of a reaction, are under investigation. These may be most helpful when used in combination with clinical history and skin testing results.

- **Antigen leukocyte cellular antibody testing**

- **Electrodermal testing**

- **Hair analysis**

- **Applied kinesiology**

- **Iridology**

- **Genetic analysis**

These tests should not be utilized in the diagnostic process for IgE-mediated food allergies according to the guidelines.

### Assessment of latex allergy in a healthcare population: Are the available tests valid [^111N2rp7]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2000). Low credibility.

Latex allergy can cause serious, preventable work-related health problems in healthcare workers, who are a high-risk group for this form of allergy. Type I hypersensitivity can produce life-threatening systemic effects and involves an allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) response to proteins found in latex. The estimated prevalence of latex allergy in healthcare workers varies widely (2.8% - 18%), and studies do not always distinguish between those who are positive in an assay for latex-specific IgE and those with clinical allergy.

- **Objective**: To assess the performance of four in-vitro methods and three skin testing methods for detecting latex-specific IgE in a group of UK healthcare workers. Test results were compared with reported clinical symptoms defined by a questionnaire.

- **Methods**: Skin prick testing was carried out on volunteers using three reagents: (a) Stallergenes commercial latex extract (Cedex, France); (b) an in-house latex glove extract; and (c) a fresh glove piece. Specific IgE levels were determined using Pharmacia AutocapTM (Uppsala, Sweden), Pharmacia UnicapTM (Uppsala, Sweden), DPC Immulite(R) (Los Angeles, USA), and Hycor HytecTM (Irvine, California, USA) methods. Each volunteer completed a questionnaire detailing latex exposure and allergic history.

- **Results**: In vitro methods for detecting specific IgE to natural rubber latex were positive in 3.6% to 43.6% of the same population. Skin prick test positivity varied between 2.9% and 14.3% with different extracts. From the subjects tested, 9.1% reported symptoms which could be consistent with latex allergy.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: Survey of drug allergy experts [^113Gvo9M]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology. Global (2025). High credibility.

When evaluating a patient with a high-risk penicillin allergy, many experts chose to include both penicillin and cephalosporin skin tests, as opposed to just performing a penicillin-based skin test, as suggested by the practice parameter. Similarly, for a high-risk cephalosporin history, more physicians recommended a penicillin skin test in addition to a cephalosporin skin test, even when evaluating whether the patient can receive cephalosporins, while the practice parameter does not suggest the need to evaluate penicillins.

We were especially interested in the approach to cefazolin allergy among drug allergy experts. Cefazolin is a first-generation cephalosporin broadly used for perioperative prophylaxis. Reviewing the chemical structures and immunogenic components of cefazolin has shown that it has two side chains (R1 and R2) whose structures do not match those of any other β-lactams in use in the United States, including penicillin. This suggests that the true rate of cross-reactivity of cefazolin to other β-lactam antibiotics may actually be close to zero. Several studies suggest that patients with past immediate reactions to cefazolin often tolerate all other cephalosporins and other β-lactams. A 2021 study demonstrated that in a series of 452 patients labeled as having penicillin allergy who underwent allergy testing, none had a positive skin test result when tested specifically for cefazolin or ceftriaxone. In a systematic review and meta-analysis from 2021 looking at dual allergy to penicillin and cefazolin, less than 1% of non-confirmed penicillin allergy also had the label.

### Allergy testing: Common questions and answers [^115Wvdmd]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

An estimated 10% to 30% of the global population has an allergic disease. Clinical presentations of allergic diseases, respiratory infections, and autoimmune conditions have similar features. Allergy and immunologic testing can help clarify the diagnosis and guide treatment. Immediate immunoglobulin E (IgE) and delayed T cell-mediated reactions are the main types of allergic responses. The allergens suspected in an immediate IgE-mediated response are identified through serum IgE-specific antibody or skin testing. For patients with an inhalant allergy, skin or IgE-specific antibody testing is preferred.

In patients with food allergies, eliminating the suspected allergenic food from the diet is the initial treatment. If this is ineffective, IgE-specific antibody or skin testing can exclude allergens. An oral food challenge should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Patients with an anaphylactic reaction to an insect sting should undergo IgE-specific antibody or skin testing. Skin testing for penicillin has a high negative predictive value and can help when penicillin administration is indicated and there are limited alternatives. Testing for other drug allergies has less well-determined sensitivity and specificity but can guide the diagnosis. Patch testing can help identify the allergen responsible for contact dermatitis.

### The use of penicillin skin testing to assess the prevalence of penicillin allergy in an emergency department setting [^1124Fedn]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Patient-reported penicillin allergies are often unreliable and can result in unnecessary changes in antibiotic therapy. Although penicillin allergy skin testing is commonly performed in allergy clinics, it has not been used in emergency departments (EDs) to verify self-reported allergies. We hypothesize that ED-based testing is possible and that the false-positive rate of patients with self-reported penicillin allergy is greater than 90%.

- **Methods**: This prospective observational cohort study enrolled a convenience sample of ED patients with a self-reported penicillin allergy. Patients were enrolled by one of two emergency physicians who performed skin prick and intracutaneous tests with penicillin major and minor determinants. The total testing time was 30 minutes. The proportion of false-positive self-reported allergies was computed with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the score method.

- **Results**: A total of 150 patients (mean age 42 years; SD 16 years; 46% men; 47% black) were enrolled. The false-positive rate for self-reported penicillin allergy was 137 of 150 (91.3%; 95% CI 85.3% to 95.1%). There were no adverse reactions associated with penicillin skin testing. Compared with patients with a false-positive penicillin allergy result (confirmed by negative penicillin skin testing result), patients reporting a true penicillin allergy confirmed by positive penicillin skin test results tended to be more frequently men (61.5% versus 44.5%; Δ17.0%; 95% CI -13.5% to 42%) and black (69.2% versus 44.5%; Δ24.7%; 95% CI -6.9% to 46.8%).

### Peanut allergy: An epidemiologic analysis of a large database [^116Gdkb4]. Journal of Pediatrics (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to confirm new observations on peanut allergy and address concerns that families and healthcare providers have about this condition.

Children who presented with a history of peanut allergy or peanut sensitization were asked to participate in a registry. This allowed for an analysis focused on questions posed by a food allergy support group about children with peanut allergy or sensitization.

A total of 1,070 children were entered into the registry over five years. Two-thirds of these children experienced a reaction to peanuts. Children with peanut allergy were predominantly male (63%), white (78%), and had private health insurance (80%). Most reactions involved the skin (55%), and anaphylaxis occurred in 35% of cases. The median age for a reaction was one year. Atopic dermatitis was noted in 60% of participants, and asthma was present in 41%. Additionally, 58% of the children had other food allergies. Upon second exposures, 28% experienced a more severe reaction. Skin test size did not differentiate the type of reaction, and children with anaphylaxis had slightly higher specific IgE levels. Severe reactions due to inadvertent exposure in children who were peanut sensitized were rare (< 1%).

The strategies for peanut allergy prevention and treatment have evolved. The data obtained from this large registry can address many questions that families and healthcare providers have during this transition.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: Survey of drug allergy experts [^116yiWYZ]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2025). Low credibility.

For scenario C, the practice parameters recommend the normal administration of a dissimilar cephalosporin and a skin test-based approach for a structurally similar cephalosporin in patients with an anaphylactic history to penicillin. Our survey results showed that 23% elected to perform a penicillin-based skin test and focus only on proving or disproving the penicillin allergy, which aligns with practice parameters' recommendations.

For scenario D, for a patient with a high-risk cephalosporin history, the practice parameters suggest a cephalosporin skin test as the evaluation approach. Forty-eight percent of the experts in our survey chose answers that aligned with this approach.

For scenario E, for patients with another high-risk history of a cephalosporin, specifically cefazolin, a higher number of participants (57%) chose a cephalosporin skin test as their evaluation.

In the scenario following scenario E, we specifically asked about the recommended steps in cephalosporin use when the skin test results are positive for cefazolin. For this scenario, most experts (34, 79.1%) recommended avoiding cefazolin and conducting an oral challenge with a structurally dissimilar cephalosporin, versus 9 experts (20.9%) who recommended avoiding cefazolin alone, without the need to continue to an oral challenge.

We attempted to perform a post hoc analysis to look for a correlation between the experts' time in practice and their adherence to the guidelines, but we found no such correlation in any of the case scenarios.

The survey's last section asked about the impact of the 2022 practice.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, specifically with respect to drug challenge testing, the 2014 AAAAI/ACAAI/EAACI/ICON/WAO/iCAALL guidelines recommend obtaining a drug challenge test as the gold standard to identify the drug eliciting a drug hypersensitivity reaction. Prefer the oral route whenever possible for drug challenge testing.

### Drug allergy diagnosis work up [^1152djtK]. Allergy (2002). Low credibility.

Drug hypersensitivity reactions are a daily concern for clinicians. The tools available for a definitive diagnosis are limited and poorly validated. They include a thorough clinical history, standardized skin tests, reliable biological tests, and sometimes drug provocation tests. These tools are currently being evaluated by the European Network of Drug Allergy, under the aegis of the EAACI drug hypersensitivity group of interest.

### Road map for the clinical application of the basophil activation test in food allergy [^114dYJZn]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2017). Low credibility.

Do we need improved diagnostic testing for IgE-mediated food allergy? The diagnostic performance of skin prick test (SPT) and specific IgE to whole extracts can vary depending on the food sources and the quality of the allergen extracts. Allergen extracts usually contain major and minor allergens relevant to the food's ability to elicit allergic reactions. However, allergen extracts obtained from certain food sources, such as soya, wheat, and certain nuts and seeds, may miss some important allergens (e.g. lipophilic proteins, such as oleosins, and other proteins that are lost during the production of the extracts), which can impair their diagnostic utility.

Generally, when interpreting SPT and specific IgE as positive at the low limits of detection, these tests have a high sensitivity but poor specificity. Therefore, without clinical history suggestive of allergy, the mere detection of sensitization by SPT or specific IgE leads to high false-positive rates and low positive predictive values (PPVs). When 95% PPV value cut-offs are used (e.g. 8 mm for SPT to peanut and 15 kU/L for specific IgE to peanut), the specificity of these tests is enhanced, but their sensitivity is reduced, resulting in many false negatives and low negative predictive value (NPV).

As a result, a large proportion of patients tested, particularly when the pre-test probability is low (e.g. no or remote history of known ingestion), have intermediate range results for SPT and specific IgE and require an oral food challenge (OFC) to clarify whether they have a food allergy.

### Diagnostic testing in the evaluation of food allergy [^115W9pHo]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2011). Low credibility.

Food-related symptoms are frequent in childhood, and pediatricians are often requested to initiate a food allergy diagnostic workup. A careful history is the cornerstone for assessing whether tests are needed and which diagnostic procedures are most appropriate. Skin prick tests should be performed only according to standard procedures by a skilled health professional. Determining serum IgE levels (in vitro tests) is available for a wide range of foods. Of utmost importance is the need to correlate test results to the clinical picture. When a conclusion cannot be reached, oral food challenges should be performed for a definite diagnosis.

### Does provider specialty matter [^113EfEDA]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2019). Low credibility.

Multiple practice guidelines discourage the indiscriminate use of broad panels of allergen-specific IgE (sIgE) tests due to the increased risk of false positives and misinterpretation of results. We provide an analytical framework to identify specialty-specific differences in ordering patterns and effectiveness, which can be used to improve test utilization.

- **Methods**: Test results from a tertiary pediatric hospital were analyzed by ordering specialty to evaluate the size of allergen workups. Positivity rates were analyzed to determine effectiveness in selecting tests with high positive pretest probabilities. Laboratory test menu components were also evaluated.

- **Results**: Our findings demonstrate that 29% of sIgE tests are ordered as part of broad workups (> 20 sIgE tests/date of service) contrary to the recommended testing approach. Detailed descriptions of ordering patterns and positivity rates are provided.

- **Conclusions**: This study provides a framework for using a cross-sectional analytical approach to assess test utilization patterns and evaluate components of laboratory testing menus.

### Clinical laboratory assessment of immediate-type hypersensitivity [^111x4Mg1]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2010). Low credibility.

Clinical laboratory analyses aid in the diagnosis and management of human allergic (IgE-dependent) diseases. Diagnosis of immediate-type hypersensitivity begins with a thorough clinical history and physical examination. Once symptoms compatible with an allergic disorder have been identified, a skin test, blood test, or both for allergen-specific IgE antibodies provide confirmation of sensitization, which strengthens the diagnosis.

Skin testing provides a biologically relevant immediate-type hypersensitivity response with resultant wheal-and-flare reactions within 15 minutes of allergen application. Allergen-specific IgE antibody in serum is quantified using three laboratory-based autoanalyzers: ImmunoCAP, Immulite, and HYTEC-288, along with novel microarray and lateral-flow immunoassays.

Technologic advances in serologic allergen-specific IgE measurements have involved increased automation, enhanced reproducibility, greater quantification, lower analytic sensitivity, and component-supplemented extract-based allergen use. In vivo provocation tests involving inhalation, ingestion, or injection of allergens serve to clarify discordant history and skin- or blood-based measures of sensitization.

Other diagnostic allergy laboratory analyses include total and free serum IgE measurement, precipitating IgG antibodies specific for organic dusts, mast cell tryptase, and indicator allergen analyses to assess indoor environments. This promotes patient-targeted allergen avoidance programs. A critique is provided on the predictive utility of serologic measures of specific IgE for food allergy.

### Allergic and hypersensitivity conditions in non-specialist care: Flow diagrams to support clinical practice [^113gwY4M]. Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

In spite of the fact that allergy, in one of its many guises, accounts for an estimated 6% of consultations, the primary care clinician has often received little or no training at either the undergraduate or postgraduate level concerning this disease area. There is clearly a need to upskill healthcare professionals working in primary care. At the time of writing, there are two publications that have identified the core skills required for primary care practitioners, with a further one for professions allied to health. However, in general, there is no sign of these being implemented, although for the first time, allergy is included as part of the postgraduate curriculum for primary care in the United Kingdom.

The making of a diagnosis, even if this is provisional until confirmed, is a critical step in patient management. It was previously called for by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) "to develop simplified pathways for the diagnosis and management of allergic diseases in primary care". Diagnosis is a complex process, requiring an underlying level of relevant clinical knowledge, pattern recognition, and interpretative skills to be successful. An incorrect diagnosis leads to inappropriate investigation and management decisions, which may cause patient harm and incur greater expense to the patient and to society.

The diagnostic process in allergy is further confounded by the presence of non-allergic diseases, from which it must be differentiated. For example, allergic asthma and non-allergic asthma or IgE-mediated food allergy, and non-IgE-mediated food allergy must be accurately diagnosed to ensure appropriate treatment and management.

### What the clinician should know when ordering a mast cell tryptase test: A review article for the North American practicing clinician [^112KNRkU]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2025). Low credibility.

Tryptase is currently the most specific mast cell biomarker available in clinical laboratories. Tryptase levels in the peripheral blood contribute to the diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic evaluation of the following three clinical categories: (1) immediate hypersensitivity reactions, including the life-threatening systemic form known as anaphylaxis; (2) clonal mast cell diseases and other myeloid malignancies, also as a biomarker for the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents targeting mast cell survival; and (3) hereditary α-tryptasemia, a genetic trait found in 4% to 8% of the general population, associated with an increased risk of severe immediate hypersensitivity reactions.

Rapidly evolving pathophysiology knowledge and management guidelines affect tryptase use in clinical practice, explaining the need for frequent updates. Such updates often lack context on the pathophysiology and methods regarding mast cells and tryptase, thus hampering the practicing clinician's ability to get the full picture from tryptase test results. Here, we provide the practicing physician with the 2025 state-of-the-art recommendations on tryptase use and interpretation in clinical practice, also exposing their basic, clinical, and technical foundations.

Successive additions to mast cell and tryptase research are summarized and revisited in light of today's knowledge. The review sections are titled to reflect matter-of-fact questions arising in clinical practice. Currently unmet needs of tryptase use and selected lines of ongoing research expected to influence clinical practice in the near future are also presented.

### The predictive value of total serum IgE for a positive allergen specific IgE result [^113CjCbb]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2004). Low credibility.

The measurement of total serum IgE and allergen-specific IgE is frequently requested to assess potential allergies. As public awareness increases, so do the requests for allergy assessment. Unless there is a clear "allergen suspect" in the patient's history, multiple allergen-specific IgE tests may be requested. This practice increases the likelihood of detecting borderline increases in allergen-specific IgE levels, the clinical relevance of which is uncertain, and has important cost implications for healthcare services.

- **Aims**: To provide an evidence base for this observation.

- **Methods**: In this retrospective observational study, results from 301 patients under 16 years of age, whose blood was taken for "allergy testing" between March 2001 and February 2003, were studied.

- **Results**: Allergen-specific IgE testing in children with low total serum IgE concentrations (< 10 IU/litre) yielded very few positive results (three of 73 children), except in those being investigated for an acute reaction to a single food. When IgE levels were 11–20 kU/litre, 13 of 73 children had positive allergen-specific IgE results. In the 21–40 kU/litre IgE group, 16 of 74 children had positive results, and in the 41–80 kU/litre group, 22 of 81 children had positive allergen-specific IgE results.

- **Conclusions**: Allergen-specific IgE testing in children with low IgE concentrations (< 10 kU/litre) produces few positive results in patients with non-specific symptoms. Laboratories should perform allergy testing for specific allergens regardless of total IgE concentration only when there are convincing clinical reasons to do so and should refrain from testing if the total IgE is < 10 kU/litre.

### Stinging insect hypersensitivity: A practice parameter update 2016 [^114p8EcA]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hymenoptera sting allergy, specifically with respect to specific IgE testing, AAAAI/ACAAI 2017 guidelines recommend obtaining serum venom-specific IgE testing in patients with a history of systemic reactions to an insect sting. Recognize that venom IgE-positive patients are at an increased risk for subsequent sting anaphylaxis and are eligible for venom immunotherapy.

### Management of allergy to penicillins and other beta-lactams [^1122ipg2]. Clinical and Experimental Allergy (2015). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for drug allergy, more specifically with respect to the evaluation of penicillin allergy, BSACI 2015 guidelines recommend obtaining skin testing to penicillins and the required cephalosporin. This is to establish whether sensitization is to the β-lactam core or side chain if a cephalosporin is required by a patient with a previous reaction. Subsequent challenge testing should be obtained to exclude allergy or for desensitization if the patient is allergic.

### Penicillin allergy testing is cost-saving: An economic evaluation study [^116kHFz7]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2021). High credibility.

Having a penicillin allergy label is associated with the use of less appropriate and more expensive antibiotics, along with increased healthcare utilization. Penicillin allergy testing results in the delabeling of most allergy claimants and may be cost-saving. This study aimed to project whether penicillin allergy testing in patients reporting a penicillin allergy is indeed cost-saving.

- **Methods**: In this economic evaluation study, we built decision models to project the economic impact of two strategies for a patient with a penicillin allergy label: (1) perform diagnostic testing (drug challenges, with or without skin tests), and (2) do not perform diagnostic testing. The health service perspective was adopted, considering costs associated with penicillin allergy tests, hospital bed-days, outpatient visits, antibiotic use, and diagnostic testing. Twenty-four base case decision models were constructed, accounting for variations in the diagnostic workup, setting (inpatient vs. outpatient), and geographic region. Uncertainty was explored via probabilistic sensitivity analyses.

- **Results**: Penicillin allergy testing was cost-saving in all decision models analyzed. For models assessing the performance of both skin tests and drug challenges, allergy testing resulted in average savings (in United States [US] dollars) of $657 for inpatients (US: $1444; Europe: $489) and $2746 for outpatients (US: $256; Europe: $6045). Seventy-five percent of simulations obtained through probabilistic sensitivity analysis identified testing as the less costly option.

- **Conclusions**: Penicillin allergy testing was projected to be cost-saving across all models.

### Evaluation of cephalosporin allergy: Survey of drug allergy experts [^113Kkyyv]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2025). High credibility.

If further prospective studies provide an evidence base for low-risk cephalosporin allergy evaluation through drug oral challenges (DOCs), drug allergy providers in the community may actually perform DOCs with cephalosporins.

In support of the idea that drug allergy practice in the United States is rapidly evolving, with experts receptive to the evolving evidence and ready to change their practice guidelines, most experts reported that they performed more DOCs, more single-dose challenges, and fewer skin tests. They also affirmed that the updated drug allergy practice parameters (DAPP) had already influenced their practice.

Drug challenge remains the reference standard to remove a drug allergy label. In low-risk cases, performing skin tests before drug challenge may not be that helpful. Increased uptake of DOCs, as shown in our survey, may represent an impact of the 2022 DAPP and associated guideline recommendation changes from the 2010 version. However, we observed significant variation in test practices of cephalosporin allergy among drug allergy experts when evaluating high-risk reactions, with variations among the experts as well as variations from the recommended DAPP pathways. This likely reflects a need for a better evidence base to guide the consensus on testing higher-risk reactions in clinical practice.

### Pearls and pitfalls of allergy diagnostic testing: Report from the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology/American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology specific IgE test task force [^116yzMZG]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2008). Low credibility.

The intended purpose of this monograph is to provide a general overview of allergy diagnostics for healthcare professionals who care for patients with allergic disease. For a more comprehensive review of allergy diagnostic testing, readers can refer to the Allergy Diagnostic Practice Parameters. A key message is that a positive allergy test result (skin or blood) indicates only the presence of allergen-specific IgE, referred to as sensitization; it does not necessarily mean clinical allergy, which is allergic symptoms with exposure.

For this reason, it is important that the allergy evaluation be based on the patient's history and directed by a healthcare professional who has sufficient understanding of allergy diagnostic testing. This expertise is crucial to using the information obtained from the patient's evaluation to determine:

1. What allergy diagnostic tests to order
2. How to interpret the allergy diagnostic test results
3. How to use the information obtained from the allergy evaluation to develop an appropriate therapeutic treatment plan.

### Standardized testing and written communication improve patient understanding of beta-lactam allergy testing outcomes: A multicenter, prospective study [^114cLGfu]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology Global (2022). Low credibility.

Eighteen to 25% of hospital inpatients report an antibiotic allergy. Such patients often experience longer hospital stays, higher incidences of Clostridium difficile, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci infections, and have a greater likelihood of intensive care admission and in-hospital mortality. They also incur higher costs compared to patients without an antibiotic allergy label. Up to 54% of reported antibiotic allergies are to beta-lactams, commonly referred to as "penicillin allergy".

Delabeling involves the assessment and testing required to disprove a patient's immune-mediated reaction to a medication. Antibiotic allergy delabeling can be time and resource-intensive as it requires dedicated challenge clinics and specialized healthcare staff trained in skin prick and intradermal testing techniques, interpretation, and the management of anaphylaxis. Although many expert consensus guidelines exist, there are no standardized methods for assessing risk before proceeding to an antibiotic challenge, nor standardized testing protocols. There are also no standards for communicating results to patients and other clinicians to ensure the uptake of recommendations.

Antibiotic allergy testing generally results in 80% to 90% of patients being delabeled. However, a recent survey of Australian hospital specialists and pharmacists identified significant barriers to testing, with 42% of respondents either unaware of or lacking access to antibiotic allergy testing services. Furthermore, there are no published data demonstrating the effectiveness and long-term outcomes of these practices.

### A practical guide to patch testing [^113H8Ahs]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). Low credibility.

Contact dermatitis is a common disease managed by allergists, dermatologists, and primary care physicians. The gold standard for diagnosing allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is patch testing, which is indicated for any patient with a chronic, pruritic, eczematous, or lichenified dermatitis if underlying or secondary ACD is suspected. Patients with acute generalized dermatitis, especially those who have extensive eczema on the back, are on immunosuppressant medications, or have applied topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, or ultraviolet radiation to the patch test (PT) site, may experience suppressed PT reactions.

The procedure of patch testing is straightforward to perform. However, the interpretation of the PT requires critical components, including an appropriate level of suspicion for ACD diagnosis, testing the relevant allergens in the correct vehicle and concentration, and having the necessary experience to interpret results properly. A careful history and physical examination must be correlated with the PT result to establish clinical relevance. Once the PT is completed, allergens are identified, and relevance is established; educating the patient about avoiding exposure is critical.

The Joint Task Force of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, and the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology has developed updated practice parameters for contact dermatitis and patch testing, which will be discussed.
