## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a simple, grammatically corrected rewrite of their note and the appropriate differential diagnosis of a red, itchy rash confined to the left axilla that did not improve with over-the-counter hydrocortisone 1% or Neosporin ointment. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the key clinical clues from location, morphology, and treatment response. Then, I should weigh the most likely etiologies in intertriginous skin, including contact dermatitis and infections. Next, I will consider important inflammatory mimickers and early hidradenitis. After that, I should outline a targeted workup including patch testing, KOH examination, and Wood's lamp. Finally, I will consider initial management strategies and when to escalate or refer, making sure to verify any assumptions against guideline-supported recommendations [^114MQCL7] [^1111SgSS].

> Let me first confirm the anchor facts and implications. The axilla is an intertriginous, warm, and moist area prone to irritant or allergic contact dermatitis and to certain infections such as Candida and Corynebacterium minutissimum, as well as to dermatophytes and bacterial folliculitis, so localization alone keeps multiple categories in play [^114MQCL7]. Wait, let me verify the laterality, because unilateral involvement nudges me more toward a localized contactant exposure, focal infection, or early hidradenitis, rather than a symmetric systemic eruption, and the prompt indeed says left axilla only, which supports localized etiologies over generalized dermatoses [^114MQCL7]. I should also flag that nonresponse or worsening after hydrocortisone and a triple-antibiotic ointment can signal either undertreatment, infection altered by steroids, or allergic contact dermatitis to either neomycin/bacitracin or even to the corticosteroid itself, which is a recognized phenomenon requiring patch test confirmation when suspected [^113WProi] [^115qLejZ] [^117SVyVF] [^1111SgSS] [^1154F2LW].

> Now, I will prioritize the most likely diagnosis. Allergic contact dermatitis to neomycin or bacitracin in the Neosporin is high on the list given the topical exposure history and lack of improvement, and the FDA labeling warns that neomycin can cause cutaneous sensitization and allergic reactions, with pruritus and erythema commonly reported, which aligns with this presentation [^113WProi] [^115qLejZ] [^117SVyVF]. I should confirm that this is epidemiologically plausible, and meta-analytic data show nontrivial patch-test positivity to neomycin in North America, supporting that this is not rare in dermatitis patients and that over-the-counter availability increases exposure risk, so this fits both mechanism and prevalence context [^117GJXoJ] [^114GTLkA]. Next, I should review guidance, and when dermatitis worsens or fails to respond after topical antibiotics or corticosteroids, guidelines recommend patch testing to suspected sensitizers, which directly supports evaluating for neomycin and bacitracin allergy here [^1111SgSS].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions, because irritant contact dermatitis from deodorants, antiperspirants, shaving products, or friction and sweat maceration is also common in the axilla and can present with burning or itch and erythema, often sharply demarcated at the site of exposure, improving with avoidance, so this remains a parallel consideration that a focused exposure history can clarify [^113WrcbU]. I need to consider candidal intertrigo, which characteristically produces a beefy red plaque with satellite pustules in occluded folds, often pruritic, and can be quickly screened by KOH preparation if morphology or distribution suggests it, particularly after topical steroid use that might modify features [^114MQCL7]. Let me also keep tinea in mind, because dermatophyte infection in axillary skin can be atypical, and steroid use can mask or alter morphology leading to so-called steroid-modified tinea, with contemporary concerns for recalcitrant strains that mimic eczema and resist terbinafine, which makes my KOH check even more important before escalating steroids [^117KeEEW] [^114NH4T8].

> Next, I should review bacterial and Corynebacterium mimics. Erythrasma is a classic intertriginous mimic that produces brown-red scaly patches and is easily screened with a Wood's lamp showing coral-red fluorescence, which can be done at bedside to rapidly refine the differential if suspected by color and scale subtleties, and I need to remember this especially when lesions are minimally pruritic but persistent [^115MFNCt]. Bacterial folliculitis or impetiginization can present with follicular pustules or crusts and localized tenderness rather than predominant itch, and this tends to respond to appropriate antibacterial therapy, making culture reasonable if pustules or exudate are present on exam, especially if I am reconsidering early hidradenitis where bacterial involvement often coexists [^114MQCL7] [^114kcyf4].

> I will now examine inflammatory mimickers that favor flexures. Inverse psoriasis can present in the axilla as smooth, well-demarcated erythematous plaques with minimal scale and pruritus, and a family or personal history may help, with poor response to low-potency steroids not ruling it out, so I should keep it as a consideration if infection and contactant causes are excluded [^114MQCL7]. Seborrheic dermatitis can occasionally involve axillae and present with erythema and greasy scale, with management options including calcineurin inhibitors to avoid chronic steroid use on thin skin in folds, so I should look for involvement of scalp and facial seborrheic areas to support this [^112LBPtK]. Hidradenitis suppurativa can start subtly in the axilla, sometimes before nodules and sinus tracts declare themselves, and early lesions may be mistaken for nonspecific dermatitis, so palpation for deep nodularity and a history of recurrent tender boils and scarring would support this diagnosis and influence management toward topical clindamycin for mild disease while addressing modifiable risks [^114kcyf4]. But wait, what if I am missing a genodermatosis such as Hailey-Hailey disease presenting with erosive plaques in the folds; that would be unusual without fissuring or erosions here, but if morphology evolves or recurs with maceration and fissures, I should biopsy to distinguish it from eczema or intertrigo, especially if there is a family history or recurrent flares in flexures [^111CnnqW].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought bilateral fold disease might dominate this list, but it is unilateral, so I should weigh localized contactant exposure and focal infections more heavily and de-emphasize symmetric systemic dermatoses like scabies, which usually presents with nocturnal itch and often bilateral involvement of typical sites such as web spaces, burrows, and multiple household contacts, making it less likely here unless additional stigmata are found on exam, though I will still keep it as a low-probability differential if history redirects me toward infestation features [^116ozbY5].

> Next, I should review the diagnostic workup in a stepwise, minimally invasive manner. I need to ensure immediate cessation of suspected offending topicals, including Neosporin and potentially all fragranced or medicated products, as avoidance is the cornerstone of managing suspected allergic or irritant contact dermatitis, and avoidance is explicitly recommended in contact dermatitis management parameters alongside medical therapy, which also reduces additional sensitization risk while I test [^113WProi] [^116sW3z2]. I should confirm sensitizer involvement through patch testing if the eruption failed to respond or worsened with topical antibiotics or corticosteroids, and I will include neomycin, bacitracin, and common excipients and fragrance on the panel owing to the exposure history, with attention that steroid allergy can masquerade as treatment failure and likewise requires patch confirmation [^1111SgSS] [^1154F2LW]. I will perform a bedside KOH scraping to evaluate for Candida and dermatophytes before escalating anti-inflammatory therapy, and if color and scale raise suspicion for erythrasma, I will add Wood's lamp examination to look for coral-red fluorescence to quickly differentiate this entity, which is both rapid and specific in many cases [^114MQCL7] [^115MFNCt]. If there are pustules or drainage, I should consider bacterial culture to guide therapy and to evaluate for secondary infection or early hidradenitis, tailoring antibiotics accordingly if indicated, which is consistent with pragmatic approaches in HS care where bacterial overgrowth complicates disease [^114kcyf4]. If the diagnosis remains uncertain after bedside tests or if morphology is atypical or refractory, I should proceed to a targeted punch biopsy to clarify inflammatory versus infectious pathology and to evaluate less common entities such as Hailey-Hailey disease or psoriasis variants, thereby preventing prolonged empiric steroid exposure in a fold [^111CnnqW].

> I will now consider initial management while testing proceeds, making sure to avoid treatments that could confound diagnosis or worsen intertriginous skin. Let me first confirm that I should stop the triple-antibiotic ointment given the risk of neomycin and bacitracin sensitization and superinfection with prolonged use, and substitute a bland barrier such as plain petrolatum while avoiding fragrances and potential sensitizers until patch results return, which aligns with labeling warnings and avoidance-first principles in contact dermatitis care [^113WProi] [^117SVyVF] [^116sW3z2]. Hold on, I should verify steroid choice in the axilla, because occluded thin skin is at higher risk of atrophy, and labeling for very potent steroids cautions against use in axillae, so if an anti-inflammatory is needed pending results, I would favor a topical calcineurin inhibitor as a steroid-sparing agent for dermatitis in sensitive areas, which is supported by both BAD guidance for contact dermatitis and primary care guidance for seborrheic and flexural dermatoses, with product labeling reminding us to reassess if there is no improvement and to pause if infection is present [^1131AAMS] [^112LBPtK] [^1144BUBL]. If KOH suggests Candida, I will treat with a topical azole and avoid steroid combinations that can mask fungal infections and complicate morphology, a principle reinforced by concerns around steroid-modified tinea and by combination product labeling that underscores limited appropriate indications and cautions in occluded areas such as diaper regions that parallel the risks in axillae, and I will reserve systemic therapy for refractory or extensive disease after mycology-guided selection [^117KeEEW] [^111Havqs]. For pruritus that disturbs sleep or function, I can consider an H1 antihistamine adjunct if topical measures are inadequate, recognizing that this is supportive care while the primary process is addressed, and I will monitor response to ensure I am not masking progression of an infection or contactant-driven process [^1175PfZL]. If HS is suspected based on nodularity or recurrent lesions, topical clindamycin is reasonable for limited disease as per guidelines, along with counseling on friction and weight management, while arranging dermatology follow-up for staging and longitudinal care if needed [^114kcyf4].

> I should double-check red flags and follow-up triggers. If there is rapid progression, erosions, severe pain, systemic symptoms, or mucosal involvement, I need to escalate to urgent in-person evaluation and consider alternative diagnoses including severe drug reactions or bullous disease, rather than continuing empiric topical therapy, and a low threshold for biopsy is appropriate when presentation is atypical or refractory despite targeted interventions, which helps avoid delayed diagnosis and prolonged exposure to potentially sensitizing or atrophy-inducing treatments in the axilla [^112QSrxp] [^114qTLAM]. Finally, I need to ensure the patient is counseled to avoid over-the-counter triple antibiotics and fragranced products in the future, particularly in intertriginous zones, and to seek patch testing if similar rashes recur or fail to respond promptly, as this is both diagnostic and preventative for allergic contact dermatitis in this clinical context [^1111SgSS] [^113WProi].

---

The patient's left axillary rash is most likely **allergic contact dermatitis** from neomycin in Neosporin [^113WProi], given the commonality of neomycin allergy [^117GJXoJ] [^116d4RpN] and the lack of response to hydrocortisone [^1154F2LW]. Other considerations include **irritant contact dermatitis, intertrigo, tinea corporis, erythrasma** [^115MFNCt], and **inverse psoriasis** [^114MQCL7]. Management should include stopping Neosporin [^113WProi], using a mid-potency topical steroid [^116sW3z2], and considering patch testing if the rash persists [^1111SgSS].

## Recommended diagnostic approach

- **Clinical history**: Detailed history of exposures, personal care products, occupational exposures, and recent medication use [^112ESgmd].

- **Physical examination**: Careful examination of rash morphology, distribution, and presence of systemic symptoms [^113F39rh].

- **Patch testing**: Recommended if allergic contact dermatitis is suspected, especially with failure to respond to topical corticosteroids [^1111SgSS].

- **KOH preparation**: To rule out fungal infection (tinea corporis) [^112QSrxp].

- **Wood's lamp examination**: To evaluate for erythrasma [^115MFNCt].

---

## Management recommendations

- **Discontinue Neosporin ointment**: Avoid further exposure to potential allergens [^113WProi].

- **Topical corticosteroids**: Consider mid-potency topical corticosteroids (e.g. triamcinolone 0.1%) for symptomatic relief [^116sW3z2] [^1131AAMS].

- **Emollients**: Regular use of emollients to restore skin barrier function [^115hUQQh].

- **Antihistamines**: Consider oral antihistamines for pruritus control [^1175PfZL].

- **Follow-up**: Re-evaluate in 2–4 weeks. If no improvement, consider biopsy or dermatology referral [^113F39rh].

### Prevalence of contact allergy to neomycin in dermatitis patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^117GJXoJ]. Contact Dermatitis (2025). Low credibility.

Neomycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic frequently employed in topical formulations, is a recognized allergen that is part of many baseline series and can cause contact allergy (CA) in both adults and children. It is an allergen of interest due to its widespread use in over-the-counter and prescription products globally, yet geographical variations may exist. This study aimed to establish prevalence estimates of CA to neomycin in dermatitis patients and to investigate potential geographical variations.

Three databases — PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science — were screened, revealing 70 included studies comprising 456,372 adults and 17,720 children who underwent patch testing. The pooled prevalence of CA to neomycin was found to be 3.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.6%-3.8%) in adults and 4.3% (95% CI: 2.65%-6.3%) in children. The highest prevalences were observed in North America (adults: 6.4%; children: 8.1%) and South Asia (adults: 4.9%), while Europe showed lower rates (adults: 2.5%; children: 0.8%). Studies after the year 2000 indicated a prevalence of 2.1% in adults and 5.1% in children across geographical regions.

These findings highlight a public health concern, particularly in regions with high prevalence rates. The study underscores the need for more restrictive use of neomycin to reduce the incidence of neomycin-induced CA.

### Erythematous scaly plaques with erosions in a 4-month-old [^113rHkc1]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

A 4-month-old previously healthy, full-term, exclusively breastfed male infant presented with a rash on the face, arms, and diaper area for 4 weeks. The patient was previously treated by his pediatrician with nystatin cream, ketoconazole cream, hydrocortisone 2.5% ointment, and oral clindamycin without significant improvement. The family history was unremarkable. There were well-demarcated erythematous crusted plaques with focal erosions of the perioral, genital, and acral skin, and scattered scaly erythematous plaques on the extremities (Fig 1, A-C). There was relative sparing of the upper cutaneous lip (Fig 1, A). Appropriate treatment resulted in rapid resolution in 2 weeks.

### Successful treatment of refractory subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus with deucravacitinib [^115AyG89]. JAAD Case Reports (2023). Low credibility.

A 51-year-old Caucasian woman with no personal or family history of atopy, psoriasis, or autoimmune disease presented for a second opinion regarding a persistent, mildly pruritic, red, scaly rash on her right cheek. The rash first appeared one year before the presentation and gradually worsened. She was previously treated with low-potency topical corticosteroids, topical azoles, metronidazole, and doxycycline. On examination, she had an erythematous, scaly, thin plaque confined to the right malar cheek. The rest of her skin examination was unremarkable, including her scalp, retroauricular and nasolabial folds, elbows, knees, and nails.

Initially, she was treated with desonide 0.05% cream and tacrolimus 0.1% ointment with only minimal improvement. Expanded series patch testing did not reveal any relevant contact allergens. A 4-mm punch biopsy was performed on the right cheek, showing a superficial-to-deep perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with rare eosinophils, focal interface changes, thickened basement membrane, and moderately increased stromal mucin. Based on the clinical presentation, histopathology, and the lack of response to treatments for other conditions such as rosacea, seborrheic dermatitis, atopic dermatitis, and psoriasis, the patient's presentation was most consistent with subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE).

### Differential diagnosis of round or discoid lesions [^111Z96DE]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Dermatologists are frequently tasked with diagnosing various skin conditions across diverse age groups. Dermatologic diagnosis, which is based on identifying a primary lesion, utilizes morphologic clues to categorize the pathological process causing the eruption. Additionally, the distribution and grouping of lesions assist in supporting a specific diagnosis. Dermatologists, either consciously or subconsciously, employ pattern recognition to form their differential diagnosis based on clinical experience and prior exposure to similarly appearing skin lesions in lectures, texts, and journals. Round and discoid patches and plaques are extremely prevalent in the clinical practice of dermatology. This contribution reviews the dermatologic conditions that present as round or discoid lesions and proposes an approach to diagnosis.

### Diagnostic value of cutaneous manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^114Kvhoq]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Similar skin symptoms were also seen in untested symptomatic users: 1429 (8.2%) users reporting any of the three main symptoms also reported a rash, compared with 6.0% for those who did not (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.23–1.42, P = 4.7×10^-15).

Association analysis highlighted a higher prevalence of either body or acral rashes among users who tested positive for SARS‐CoV‐2 compared with those who tested negative (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.42–1.97, P = 1.1×10^-9). The subtypes were similar: body rashes were associated with SARS‐CoV‐2‐positive swab with an OR of 1.66 (95% CI 1.37–1.99, P = 1.1×10^-7), whereas the OR for acral rashes was 1.74 (95% CI 1.33–2.28, P = 5.9×10^-5). In comparison, the OR for fever was 1.48 (95% CI 1.31–1.66, P = 4.3×10^-11). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the reported ORs. Positive predictive values for all symptoms are reported in Table S4 (see Supporting Information).

The comparison between 17,371 symptomatic untested users who reported at least one of the main symptoms and those who did not yielded an OR of 1.46 (95% CI 1.35–1.58, P = 1.9×10^-20) for body rash, while the association with the rarer acral rash was not significant (P = 0.21). We could not assess whether ethnicity affected the prevalence of cutaneous symptoms as the number of non‐European users with skin symptoms was too low.

### Periorbital rash and scaly plaques in a 13-year-old boy [^117J154K]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

- **Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?** A. Juvenile-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) B. Atopic dermatitis C. Allergic contact dermatitis D. Clinically amyopathic juvenile dermatomyositis (CAJDM) E. Systemic sclerosis (SSc)

- **Answers**: A. Juvenile-onset SLE – Incorrect. Following the 2019 American College of Rheumatology/European Alliance of Associations for Rheumatology classification criteria, a diagnosis of SLE cannot be made without systemic involvement and with normal laboratory data. Moreover, in SLE, facial lesions would present as a red, butterfly-shaped rash over the cheeks and nose and between the interphalangeal joints.

	- B. Atopic dermatitis – Incorrect. The absence of muscular involvement leads to a differential diagnosis with papulosquamous dermatoses, such as atopic dermatitis. However, the clinical distribution of cutaneous lesions and the absence of spongiotic dermatitis in the skin biopsy specimen are against the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis.

	- C. Allergic contact dermatitis – Incorrect. Eyelid skin is susceptible to the actions of irritating or allergenic agents; therefore, it can frequently be affected in the context of contact dermatitis. However, violaceous color and cutaneous lesions on both hands cannot be related to an exogenous agent. A cutaneous biopsy would show spongiotic dermatitis.

	- D. CAJDM – Correct. CAJDM is defined by the presence of hallmark skin lesions of dermatomyositis (heliotrope rash, Gottron papules, nailfold capillary changes, and poikiloderma involving the "V" of the chest and the upper back), with no clinical evidence.

### Contact urticaria and related conditions: Clinical review [^112ESgmd]. Contact Dermatitis (2025). Low credibility.

A critical part of the diagnostic workup for contact urticaria (CoU) and related conditions involves obtaining a thorough medical history with a high degree of suspicion. Patients should be asked about their symptoms and signs, the time from exposure to onset, the duration until resolution, and potential triggers such as food, workplace exposures, personal care products, habits, and medications. It is important to determine whether symptoms began before or after starting a particular job and if there is improvement during time away from work. Collaboration with occupational physicians is often necessary to assess potential triggers.

In patients with CoU, skin reactions are often absent during physical examination, making the evaluation of photographs of skin lesions particularly valuable. Diagnostic tests must be carefully selected, performed, and interpreted by trained professionals. False-positive results can lead to unnecessarily restrictive measures and negatively impact a patient's quality of life, while false-negative results may result in continued exposure to triggering substances.

- **Skin tests**: Skin tests for diagnosing immediate contact skin reactions are summarized in Table 4. NI-CoU is generally diagnosed based on medical history, including exposure history (e.g. photographs of cosmetic product ingredients and safety material data sheets), photographs of skin reactions, and positive non-invasive skin tests. For I-CoU, IgE sensitization must be confirmed using skin tests such as skin prick tests (SPTs) and prick-by-prick tests.

### The generalized rash: part II. Diagnostic approach [^113F39rh]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Although it is important to begin the evaluation of a generalized rash with an inclusive differential diagnosis, the possibilities must be narrowed down by taking a focused history and looking for key clinical features of the rash. Part I of this two-part article lists the common, uncommon, and rare causes of generalized rashes. In part II, the clinical features that help distinguish these rashes are described. These features include key elements of the history (e.g. travel, environmental exposures, personal or family history of atopy); characteristics of individual lesions, such as color, size, shape, and scale; and areas of involvement and sparing, with particular attention to palms, soles, face, nails, sun-exposed areas, and extensor and flexor surfaces of extremities. Additional distinguishing factors include pruritic or painful lesions; systemic symptoms, especially fever; and dermatologic signs, such as blanching and the Koebner phenomenon.

### Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis sine pustules following semaglutide injection [^1157NaNJ]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

A 36-year-old woman presented in January 2024 with approximately a 2-month history of waxing and waning rash affecting her axillae and inframammary area. The rash was associated with burning pain but was minimally pruritic. She denied any systemic symptoms or oral lesions. Her medical history was significant for obesity (BMI 36.5 kg/m²) and nephrolithiasis but was otherwise unremarkable. Her medications included multivitamins, fish oil, and a levonorgestrel IUD, none of which were new in the past year. Her only recent medication change was the initiation of weekly injections of compounded semaglutide (0.25–0.75 mg; Olympia Pharmaceuticals) in late October 2023. She otherwise denied recent changes in skincare products or detergents. She had visited urgent care on several occasions for the rash, where she was prescribed clotrimazole-betamethasone 1%/0.05% cream, ketoconazole 2% cream, hydrocortisone 2.5% cream, and fluconazole 150 mg with minimal benefit.

At the initial evaluation in our clinic, she exhibited ill-defined erythematous patches with minimal fine scale lacking vesicles, pustules, or satellite lesions in the axillary and inframammary folds (Fig 1). No lymphadenopathy or mucosal lesions were present. A potassium hydroxide examination was deferred due to recent treatment with antifungals. The differential diagnosis included contact dermatitis, symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema, and erythema annulare centrifugum. She was started on hydrocortisone 2.5% ointment twice daily and a 21-day taper of prednisone 40 mg. Despite 10 days of treatment, the text seems to cut off, and it is unclear how the treatment or condition further evolved.

PR is a self-limiting disease with a low risk of transmission and typically resolves on its own within weeks to a few months; for most patients, monitored waiting and symptomatic treatment are sufficient. General measures such as moisturizing, using emollients, and applying topical steroids can help alleviate itching or discomfort, while oral antihistamines may also provide relief. However, using stronger therapies is generally discouraged due to the unclear underlying etiopathology and the challenges in evaluating the specific effects of these treatments. Given that the disease usually resolves spontaneously, clinicians should carefully compare the benefits of potentially faster resolution with the risk of side effects or drug resistance if considering more potent therapeutics.

- **Steroids**: Both topical and systemic steroids are occasionally used to treat PR, but evidence for their effectiveness is limited. A randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study found that tapering daily low-dose of prednisolone 20 mg to 10 mg for 15 days helped with rash clearance at 2 weeks but showed a higher relapse rate at 12 weeks, indicating a potential viral reactivation after initial suppression. A study by Leonforte found that corticosteroid treatment worsened PR symptoms, including itching, irritation, and new lesion formation, especially when started in the early stages. Given PR's viral nature, oral steroids may not be ideal, and topical steroids should be limited to severely pruritic cases to prevent skin atrophy associated with prolonged use.

Antihistamines are also occasionally used, but the content ends abruptly.

### Clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate [^111Havqs]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

If you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, it is not known if clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream will harm your unborn baby. If you use clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream during pregnancy, apply it on the smallest area of the skin and for the shortest time needed. Similarly, if you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed, it is not known if clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate passes into your breast milk. Breastfeeding women should use clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream on the smallest area of skin and for the shortest time necessary. Do not apply the cream directly to the nipple and areola to avoid contact with your baby.

Inform your healthcare provider about all the medications you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Especially notify your healthcare provider if you take other corticosteroid medicines orally or use other products on your skin or scalp that contain corticosteroids.

- **What should I avoid while using clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream**: Clotrimazole and betamethasone dipropionate cream should not be used to treat diaper rash or redness. Avoid applying it in the diaper area.

Regarding the medical management of atopic dermatitis, particularly in managing pruritus, the EADV/ETFAD 2020 guidelines recommend considering the use of H1 receptor antagonists (H1RAs) for treating pruritus in patients with atopic dermatitis. This consideration comes into play if standard treatments such as topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, and emollients are not sufficient.

### The rash that becomes an erythroderma [^117TVTNh]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

Erythroderma is a dermatologic emergency with potentially serious consequences. Several diseases with different etiologies characteristically appear as erythroderma. Depending on the age groups, congenital ichthyosiform disorders, infections, preexisting dermatoses, drug eruptions, and internal malignancies commonly present with, or progress to, erythroderma. The course, prognosis, and management strategies also vary depending on the cause of erythroderma; hence, an accurate diagnosis is essential in minimizing associated morbidity and mortality.

The generalized erythema and scaling often obscure the classic clinical features of the underlying skin diseases, posing a diagnostic challenge to dermatologists. Awareness and elicitation of subtle signs and clinical manifestations are crucial. A step-wise approach ensures completeness of clinical evaluation and avoids missing any relevant clinical data.

The initial clinical presentation, cutaneous examination findings, and systemic clues reveal important information regarding the diagnosis, course, and prognosis of erythroderma. The age at onset, symptomatology, duration of illness, initial lesions, initial site of onset, clinical course, family history, types of scales, changes in cutaneous integuments, and systemic clues will assist in delineating the nature of the underlying disease.

Regarding medical management for dermatitis herpetiformis, more specifically with respect to second-line therapy, EADV 2021 guidelines recommend offering the following agents as alternative therapies in patients with dermatitis herpetiformis:

- **Sulfasalazine**: 1–4 g/day
- **Sulfamethoxypyridazine**: 0.25–1.5 g/day
- **Sulfapyridine**: Dosage not specified
- **Tetracycline plus nicotinamide**: 500 mg/500 mg four times daily
- **Potent topical corticosteroids**: Application as recommended

This list serves as a recommended approach to managing patients who may not respond adequately to first-line treatments, thereby offering clinicians a range of alternative therapeutic options.

### Tacrolimus [^1144BUBL]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take and skin products you use, including prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Keep a list of the medicines you take to show your doctor and pharmacist each time you get a new medicine.

- **How to use tacrolimus ointment**:
	- Use tacrolimus ointment exactly as prescribed, only on areas of your skin that have eczema. Apply it for short periods, and if needed, treatment may be repeated with breaks in between. Stop using the ointment when the signs and symptoms of eczema, such as itching, rash, and redness, go away, or as directed by your doctor. Follow your doctor's advice if symptoms of eczema return after treatment.

	- Call your doctor if:
	- Your symptoms worsen with tacrolimus ointment.
	- You develop a skin infection.
	- Your symptoms do not improve after 6 weeks of treatment, as other skin diseases can sometimes resemble eczema.

- **To apply tacrolimus ointment**:
	- Wash your hands before applying the ointment. Apply a thin layer twice daily to the areas affected by eczema, using the smallest amount necessary to control the symptoms. If you are a caregiver applying the ointment to a patient, or if you are not treating your hands, wash your hands with soap and water after application to remove any remaining ointment. Avoid bathing, showering, or swimming immediately after applying tacrolimus ointment.

### Pityriasis rosea in otherwise asymptomatic confirmed COVID-19-positive patients: A report of 2 cases [^116sv8du]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 23-year-old woman with no significant medical history presented for urgent care with a 1-week history of an asymptomatic diffuse rash of unknown etiology. Dermatology was consulted via teledermatology store-and-forward photographs. The rash began as a few patches and disseminated following a few days. The review of systems was otherwise negative, and she was afebrile (37.2°C). She denied new medications or known COVID-19 exposures; however, she notably worked in health care, with patient contact. Polymerase chain reaction testing result for SARS-CoV-2 performed 3 weeks prior was negative. The photographs revealed Fitzpatrick type IV skin with scattered, thin, erythematous-to-hyperpigmented plaques and patches with scale on the upper and middle portions of the chest, abdomen, back, and flanks in a Blaschkoid distribution. Larger patches with visible collarettes of scale led to the clinical diagnosis of pityriasis rosea. Rapid plasma reagin testing was nonreactive, and repeat SARS-CoV-2 testing result was positive. She was prescribed 0.1% triamcinolone ointment as needed for pruritus. The patient relocated and, therefore, has not undergone follow-up examination.

- **Figures**:
	- Photograph of scattered, thin, red-to-hyperpigmented plaques and patches with scale on the upper and middle portions of the chest in a Blaschkoid distribution.
	- Photograph of scattered, thin, red-to-hyperpigmented plaques and patches with scale on the left flank in a Blaschkoid distribution.

We hope that our cases help to diversify the available images of the skin manifestations of COVID-19.

### Blaschkoid hyperkeratotic plaques in a hemi-distribution since infancy [^116KkJmR]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A 41-year-old woman presented with brown hyperkeratotic plaques in a blaschkoid distribution on the left side of her body, including the face, neck, torso, arm, hand, leg, and foot (Fig 1). There was a sharp line of delineation in the midabdomen between normal and pathologic skin. The patient reported having these lesions since the age of 1 year. She noted difficulty healing and also noted that upon injury to the lesion, wounds would heal thicker, rougher, and darker. She denied any family history of skin disease. A biopsy specimen of the left arm was obtained and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (Fig 2).

- **Question 1: What is your diagnosis?**
	- A. Lichen planus (LP)
	- B. Incontinentia pigmenti
	- C. Linear epidermal nevus
	- D. Linear porokeratosis with dysplasia
	- E. Darier disease

- **Answers**: A. LP – Incorrect. LP typically has deeper purple, polygonal papules with fine white lines and characteristic Wickham striae. LP most commonly occurs on the limbs and dorsal aspects of the trunk, with nails and mucous membranes commonly involved.
B. Incontinentia pigmenti – Incorrect. Incontinentia pigmenti usually occurs in female infants with a staged presentation progressing in order from vesicular, verrucous, hyperpigmented, and hypopigmented and atrophic blaschkoid lesions. Abnormalities can also be seen in teeth, hair, and nails. One-third of patients have ocular and neurologic abnormalities.
C. Linear epidermal nevus – Incorrect. Linear epidermal nevi are benign hamartomatous growths of epidermal cells that typically occur at birth. Lesions are described as brown- to skin-colored plaques, and patches.

### Antibiotic allergy [^116d4RpN]. The Lancet (2019). Low credibility.

Antibiotics are the most common cause of life-threatening immune-mediated drug reactions considered off-target, including anaphylaxis, and organ-specific and severe cutaneous adverse reactions. However, many antibiotic reactions documented as allergies were unknown or not remembered by the patient, related to cutaneous reactions unrelated to drug hypersensitivity, drug-infection interactions, or drug intolerances. Although such reactions pose negligible risk to patients, they currently represent a global threat to public health.

Antibiotic allergy labels result in the displacement of first-line therapies for antibiotic prophylaxis and treatment. A penicillin allergy label, in particular, is associated with increased use of broad-spectrum and non-β-lactam antibiotics, which results in increased adverse events and antibiotic resistance. Most patients labeled as allergic to penicillins are not allergic when appropriately stratified for risk, tested, and re-challenged.

Given the public health importance of penicillin allergy, this review provides a global update on antibiotic allergy epidemiology, classification, mechanisms, and management.

### Drug-mediated rash: Erythema multiforme versus Stevens-Johnson syndrome [^111hNz9k]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Low credibility.

A 92-year-old woman presented with an acute onset generalized maculopapular rash with associated mucosal involvement, following the recent initiation of griseofulvin. The rash progressed rapidly over two days to involve most of her body; however, mucosal involvement was limited to her oral mucosa. Characteristic target lesions appeared at 72 hours, and a diagnosis of erythema multiforme secondary to griseofulvin was made after further investigation and skin biopsy. The patient was monitored closely for progression of the rash and other indicators of more severe dermatological conditions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome. She was managed symptomatically, with resolution of the rash in four weeks and full recovery to her premorbid level of functioning. This case details the diagnostic and management approach to erythema multiforme, a condition that warrants thorough consideration for the differential of Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

### Pruritic rash in a man with seminoma [^113VYzh1]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

- **Answer A - Metastatic seminoma**: Incorrect. Although seminoma commonly spreads to the lungs, CT imaging would likely find multiple variably sized confluent soft tissue nodules and masses.

- **Answer B - Adult-onset Still disease**: Incorrect. Adult-onset Still disease is a rare systemic autoinflammatory disease characterized by the classic triad of fever, joint pain, and a distinctive bumpy salmon-colored rash. This disease is often considered a diagnosis of exclusion.

- **Answer C - Bleomycin toxicity**: Correct. This is a case of bleomycin-induced flagellate erythema (BIFE), bleomycin-induced melanonychia, and bleomycin-induced lung toxicity (BILT). BIFE and persistent hyperpigmentation occur in approximately 10% to 20% of patients on bleomycin. It can present from hours to months after bleomycin exposure and is characterized by pruritic, erythematous-to-hyperpigmented, linear streaks in a whip-like pattern primarily affecting the trunk. Bleomycin-induced melanonychia is a rare brown-to-black pigmentation of the nail caused by the presence of melanin in the nail plate associated with bleomycin use. The key to diagnosis in this patient is the clinical symptomatic respiratory impairment, recent bleomycin therapy and skin toxicity, and the exclusion of infection or pulmonary involvement of the primary malignancy.

- **Answer D - Erythema ab igne**: Incorrect. Erythema ab igne is a disorder characterized by a localized macular rash in a reticulated pattern that may lead to red or brown hyperpigmentation following chronic exposure to infrared radiation in the form of heat. It is commonly seen with the use of laptops.

### Treatment and diagnostic challenges associated with the novel and rapidly emerging antifungal-resistant dermatophyte [^117KeEEW]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

T. indotineae dermatophytosis can be severe, covering large areas of the body and challenging to treat. These infections can present as extensive, pruritic plaques that are minimally inflammatory, primarily affecting the trunk, extremities, and groin, causing tinea corporis, tinea cruris, tinea faciei, and tinea genitalis. Central clearing is often absent, and the plaques may resemble eczema, with post-cure pruritus being frequently reported. Dark-skinned individuals can present with prominent pigmentation. Lesions may appear in various atypical morphologies, including erythematous, scaly concentric plaques with a "pseudoimbricata" appearance, as well as papulosquamous, pustular, or steroid-modified tinea forms.

Patients often report a history of ineffective treatment with topical or oral antifungals, including terbinafine (TRB). Some may have recently traveled to, or been in contact with individuals from, countries where T. indotineae infections are prevalent. However, domestic cases in patients without travel history are increasingly being documented. The use of topical corticosteroid products, often for severe pruritus, can exacerbate the condition by masking symptoms and altering lesion morphology, complicating diagnosis and treatment.

T. indotineae has rarely been implicated in nail or hair infections. As of the time of writing, only two cases of onychomycosis have been reported: one from Italy in a patient who immigrated from India, and the other in a French man — both involving toenails and associated with extensive tinea corporis, presenting with proximal erosion of the nail plate.

### Prevalence of contact allergy to neomycin in dermatitis patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114GTLkA]. Contact Dermatitis (2025). Low credibility.

- **Prevalence according to geographical regions**: For adults, the highest pooled prevalences of contact allergy (CA) to neomycin were found in North America (6.4%, 95% CI, 5.0%–7.9%; n = 6 studies) and South America (6.2%, 95% CI, 5.3%–7.2%; n = 2 studies). Southeast Asia reported a prevalence of 5.3% (95% CI, 3.6%–7.4%; n = 5 studies) and South Asia 4.9% (95% CI, 2.3%–8.3%; n = 3 studies). In contrast, the lowest prevalences were observed in Europe (2.5%, 95% CI, 2.0%–3.0%; n = 26 studies), East Asia (2.4%, 95% CI, 0.6%–5.3%; n = 4 studies), and the Middle East (0.8%, 95% CI, 0.2%–1.5%; n = 5 studies). Each bullet in Figure 4 represents one study, and the standard deviation (SD) was calculated for regions with two or more studies.

For children, the pooled prevalence of CA to neomycin was 0.8% (95% CI, 0.4%–1.5%; n = 12 studies) in Europe and 8.1% (95% CI, 4.9%–11.9%; n = 3 studies) in North America. Due to a limited number of studies, pooled prevalences in other regions such as the Middle East, South America, East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia could not be calculated. Note that there was only one study in children from Asia, preventing further region-specific analysis.

### S2k guidelines (consensus statement) for diagnosis and therapy of dermatitis herpetiformis initiated by the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) [^116ozbY5]. Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis, more specifically with respect to differential diagnosis, the EADV 2021 guidelines recommend differentiating dermatitis herpetiformis from the following non-autoimmune diseases:

- **Atopic dermatitis and other types of eczema**: Consider these conditions, as they can resemble dermatitis herpetiformis.
- **Multiple folliculitis**: This condition can mimic the presentation of dermatitis herpetiformis.
- **Nodular or subacute prurigo**: These should be considered in differential diagnosis.
- **Scabies**: It is important to rule out scabies as it presents with itching and lesions similar to dermatitis herpetiformis.
- **Arthropod bite reactions (papular urticaria, strophulus)**: Ensure to differentiate these from dermatitis herpetiformis as they can present similarly.

### Prevalence and determinants of sensitisation to neomycin in north-eastern Italy, 1997–2021 [^116LQVXo]. Contact Dermatitis (2025). Low credibility.

The present study is the largest investigation into neomycin sensitisation in Italy, spanning 25 years. It employs a multicentre data collection approach, assessing the impact of occupation and providing adjusted prevalence estimates over time. However, the study has limitations, including its cross-sectional design, variability in testing prevalence by research centre and calendar year, and the lack of definition of clinical relevance for neomycin sensitisation. Nonetheless, the exclusion of clinical relevance assessments, as seen in other epidemiological studies, reduced potential interpretation bias.

The majority of cases were assessed at 96 hours after commencement of the database. In Trieste, approximately a quarter of patients were evaluated at 72 hours due to organisational and technical constraints. Patients were still advised to return to the clinic in the event of late-onset reactions.

### The spectrum of sensitive skin: Considerations for skin care in vulnerable populations [^111H9QGA]. Journal of Drugs in Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Sensitive skin is a multifactorial condition where the underlying pathology is not fully understood, and the clinical signs may not always be present or obvious. Despite this challenge, recent progress has been made in understanding the different subtypes of sensitive skin, as well as developing new methods to measure the sensorial response that may not be obvious from visual examination. Similarly, there has been progress in managing symptoms through skin care regimens designed for sensitive skin. The implications of this new research indicate the potential for better clinical outcomes for sensitive skin sufferers, as well as more personalized regimens tailored to different triggers across the full spectrum of sensitive skin.

### A case of eosinophilic dermatosis of hematologic malignancy with tissue-based Th2 cytokine profiling [^115z7RJU]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Treatments of eosinophilic dermatosis of hematologic malignancy (EDHM) include topical steroids, systemic steroids, narrow-band UVB phototherapy, oral antihistamines, dapsone, and antibiotics. However, there is only limited data regarding the efficacy of these treatments. Studies have shown that patients with EDHM often respond to systemic steroids, with or without concomitant topical steroids, but the majority relapse once steroids are discontinued.

Dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody approved for atopic dermatitis that targets the alpha subunit of the IL-4 receptor to inhibit IL-4 and IL-13 signaling, has been used off-label in patients with EDHM who experience frequent flares. It has achieved sustained responses for multiple months in select patients. Maglie et al. selected a patient for dupilumab treatment based on the presence of inflammatory cells expressing IL-4, detected by immunohistochemistry in a lesional skin biopsy during a disease flare, and observed complete lesion clearance after 6 weeks of treatment.

Using RNA in situ hybridization, we demonstrate equivocal IL-4 and IL-5 staining, but prominent IL-13 staining, which had not been previously demonstrated in EDHM (see Fig 2). Recent therapeutic advances have led to the development of novel IL-13–specific monoclonal antibodies, including lebrikizumab and the recently approved tralokinumab for atopic dermatitis. Our immunologic characterization of the patient's lesions supports the role of IL-13 in EDHM. Future studies are needed to evaluate if IL-13 is commonly elevated in the skin or serum of patients with EDHM and whether IL-13 targeted agents are efficacious in treatment.

### Bullous drug eruption with leukemic cell infiltrate in the setting of new-onset acute myeloid leukemia [^111sdS17]. JAAD Case Reports (2017). Low credibility.

Based on the patient's cutaneous eruption and newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the differential diagnosis included leukemia cutis, Sweet syndrome, erythema multiforme, a viral exanthema, and a bullous drug eruption. Two skin biopsies were performed: one from an intact vesicle on the left periaxillary skin and the second from an erythematous plaque of the chest. Histologic examination of the specimen from the chest found marked papillary dermal edema with a perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrate (Fig. 2). The biopsy from the left periaxillary lesion revealed an intraepidermal vesicle and prominent papillary dermal edema with a perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrate. Immunostains showed that the infiltrate was CD3− and strongly positive for CD43 and CD33. Immunostains for CD117, CD20, CD34, and myeloperoxidase were negative. These findings support a leukemic cell infiltrate at the site of this eruption and are consistent with a bullous dermal hypersensitivity reaction pattern with a leukemic cell infiltrate.

Although leukemic cells were present, the histologic pattern was not consistent with the dense aggregates of atypical cells typical of leukemia cutis. Sweet syndrome is associated with myeloid leukemia. The details on immunostains show:

- **Figure 2**: Hematoxylin-eosin stain of a skin biopsy from a left periaxillary vesicle shows:
	- A and B: An intraepidermal vesicle and prominent papillary dermal edema with a perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrate.
	- C: A mononuclear cell infiltrate (original magnification: A, ×4; B, ×10; C, ×40).

- **Figure 3**: Immunostains performed on chest specimen demonstrate:
	- A: CD43;
	- B: CD20;
	- C: CD3.

### Diagnostic value of cutaneous manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^117LR5pL]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Fourthly, some of these cutaneous manifestations could have been caused by adverse reactions to drugs used to treat SARS-CoV-2 and/or for other purposes. Due to the size of our study and the nature of the app used to collect our data, we could not gather a full history of drug usage, either at the time of data collection or retrospectively. However, we expect the number of community-based users on drugs that could have also caused a rash to be very low compared with the number of rashes observed in hospitalized patients and, therefore, drugs are unlikely to have been a major alternate cause of rashes. Similarly, we could not collect information on pre-existing skin diseases and could not investigate whether they influenced the rate of the reported rashes.

In summary, this study strongly supports the inclusion of skin rashes in the list of suspicious COVID-19 symptoms. Although they are less prevalent than fever, they are more specific, last longer, and can be easily spotted by patients. Importantly, from the survey reported in this study, it was the only presentation in one-fifth of the patients diagnosed with COVID-19.

Increased awareness from the public and healthcare professionals regarding COVID-19 skin changes will allow more efficient detection of infection and contact tracing.

### Lessons from the skin — cutaneous features of familial cancer [^115ph4q8]. The Lancet Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

As the molecular basis of disease continues to be elucidated, familial cancer syndromes, which consist of a range of neoplastic and non-neoplastic features, are emerging. The usual pathway of referral to a genetics clinic or familial cancer centre is via an oncologist when high-risk features that suggest a possible hereditary basis for the presenting cancer are recognized. Traditionally, these high-risk features include more than two family members with similar cancers over two or more generations, a young age of onset, and more than one synchronous or metachronous tumor. These features are effective in ascertaining a substantial proportion of families with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer due to a BRCA mutation or the more common bowel cancer predisposition syndromes, such as hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer and familial adenomatous polyposis. However, there is a range of familial cancer syndromes that are not easily detected and that can remain undiagnosed when history and examination are not extended to include non-malignant features. The identification of cutaneous signs associated with rare familial cancer syndromes provides individuals and their families with the opportunity to undertake early surveillance for malignant and non-malignant complications that might, in time, be shown to improve outcomes.

### Dress syndrome: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms [^1162cbfV]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2017). Low credibility.

Dress syndrome is a cutaneous and systemic drug reaction with severe complications and a long course that can be fatal. Recognition may be difficult, and the condition is just rare enough that clinicians will eventually see it but may not be familiar with it. This review focuses on key elements to help clinicians with the challenges of recognition and differential diagnosis.

### S2k guidelines (consensus statement) for diagnosis and therapy of dermatitis herpetiformis initiated by the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) [^116gcSxH]. Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for dermatitis herpetiformis, particularly in terms of differential diagnosis, the EADV 2021 guidelines recommend differentiating dermatitis herpetiformis from the following autoimmune bullous diseases:

- **Linear IgA dermatosis**: Differentiation is essential to ensure accurate diagnosis and treatment.
- **Bullous pemphigoid**: Clinicians should be aware of its clinical presentation to prevent misdiagnosis.
- **Anti-laminin gamma-1 pemphigoid**: This condition should be meticulously distinguished from dermatitis herpetiformis.
- **Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita**: Attention to detail is necessary in identifying this potential differential.
- **Bullous SLE**: A careful examination is recommended to differentiate it accurately.
- **Pemphigus herpetiformis**: Adequate differentiation is crucial to avoid treatment errors.
- **IgA pemphigus**: Accurate identification can ensure proper management and therapeutic options.

### The diagnostic challenge of coma blisters [^115jWnwA]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Coma blisters are a benign dermatologic condition that can be diagnostically challenging. This case was unique in that the lesions in question closely mimicked retiform purpura in a patient with a darker skin tone, Fitzpatrick type V. Distinguishing coma blisters from more serious diseases requires thorough history-taking, dermatologic examination, and timely skin biopsy. Increased representation of images of dermatologic disease in patients with darker skin tones may help improve diagnostic acumen.

### Contact dermatitis: a practice parameter-update 2015 [^112Kj8At]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2015). High credibility.

The 2015 AAAAI/ACAAI guidelines recommend that diagnostic investigations for contact dermatitis, particularly regarding evaluation for specific allergens found in personal products or cosmetics, should include an evaluation for patients displaying a facial rash in the periorbital areas. This evaluation is crucial for identifying allergic contact dermatitis caused by components such as fragrances, preservatives, and excipients, which are common sensitizers of the facial skin.

Warnings and precautions regarding the use of bacitracin / neomycin / polymyxin B OPHTH (also known as Medi-First, Neosporin Original, Triple Antibiotic):

- **Skin rash, skin erythema**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as antibiotics, particularly neomycin sulfate, may cause cutaneous sensitization.

- **Superinfection**: Maintain a high level of suspicion, as prolonged use of bacitracin zinc / neomycin sulfate / polymyxin B sulfate may result in overgrowth of non-susceptible organisms, particularly fungi.

### Teledermatology viewpoint: Sudden onset of a widespread rash [^1168nXsv]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

Although there are limitations to teledermatology because of lighting, focus, composition, and bias regarding which lesions have been photographed, which can mask important clues, this case showcases how store-and-forward teledermatology was used to make important recommendations to the school nurse. Research has indicated that accuracy in diagnosis and effectiveness in management have been comparable to in-person dermatological care, especially concerning skin cancers. Pathognomonic features were visible in this EI case, demonstrating the potential usefulness of store-and-forward teledermatology in diagnosing inflammatory skin conditions as well.

In other, less clear-cut cases, research shows that teledermatology is beneficial for triage, either providing feedback for management to the referring clinician or recommending further in-person evaluation. Although some studies claim the clinical usefulness of store-and-forward teledermatology is limited, this case supports the functionality of teledermatology for diagnosing distinct inflammatory conditions.

### Elidel [^113qActq]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Tell your doctor about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements. Make sure to also inform your doctor about all the skin medicines and products you use.

Know the medicines you take and keep a list of them with you. Show this list to your doctor and pharmacist each time you get a new medicine.

- **How should I use Elidel cream, 1%**: Use Elidel cream, 1% exactly as your doctor tells you. Stop using Elidel cream, 1% when the signs and symptoms of eczema, such as itching, rash, and redness, go away, or as directed by your doctor. Wash your hands before using Elidel cream, 1%. If you apply Elidel cream, 1% following a bath or shower, make sure your skin is dry.

Apply a thin layer of Elidel cream, 1% only to the affected skin areas twice each day, as directed by your doctor. Use the smallest amount necessary to help control the signs and symptoms of eczema.

If you apply Elidel cream, 1% to another person, or if you have eczema and are not treating your hands, it is important to wash your hands with soap and water after applying the cream to remove any residue. Avoid bathing, showering, or swimming right after applying Elidel cream, 1%, as this could wash off the cream.

You can use moisturizers with Elidel cream, 1%, but ask your doctor first about the products that are right for you. People with eczema can have very dry skin, so it is important to maintain good skin care practices. If you use moisturizers, apply them after Elidel cream, 1%.

Call your doctor if your symptoms worsen with Elidel cream.

### The rash that presents as a vesiculobullous eruption [^114qTLAM]. Clinics in Dermatology (2019). Low credibility.

Various infections, autoimmune conditions, and reactive skin conditions can present with blisters of varying sizes. Some of these disorders are commonly seen in everyday practice, whereas others are rarely encountered. In many cases, the clinical picture is so typical that the diagnosis is easy and obvious. Nevertheless, the significant clinical overlap between many of these diseases can cause frustration for both inexperienced and expert clinicians. We present the most typical clinical clues and offer simplified algorithms for diagnosing skin conditions with vesicles and bullae.

When assessing a patient with blisters on the skin, focus is on several aspects: the age of onset, a history of comorbidities and medication intake, the general condition of the patient, and most importantly, the distribution, number, size, morphology, and evolution of the blisters. Additionally, the characteristics of the peribullous skin and the presence of mucosal involvement are considered. Emphasis is placed on differentiating between potentially life-threatening blistering eruptions and more benign, self-limiting conditions.

### Zovirax [^111w5Nn5]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.

- **How should I use Zovirax cream**: Use Zovirax Cream exactly as your healthcare provider instructs you to use it. Start using Zovirax Cream at the onset of the first symptoms of a cold sore, such as itching, redness, burning, tingling, or when the cold sore appears. Wash your hands with soap and water before and after applying Zovirax Cream. Ensure the affected area is clean and dry prior to application. Apply Zovirax Cream to the affected area 5 times daily for 4 days, ensuring coverage of the outer edge. Refrain from applying other skin products to the affected area during treatment with Zovirax Cream. Avoid unnecessary rubbing of the cold sore, as this can cause it to spread to other areas around your mouth or exacerbate the cold sore.

- **What are the possible side effects of Zovirax cream**: The most common side effects of Zovirax Cream are skin reactions at the treatment site. These may include dry or cracked lips, peeling, flaking, dryness of the skin, a burning or stinging sensation, and itching.

### Diagnostic value of cutaneous manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^111TDkng]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

COVID-19 is now known to have varied clinical manifestations and to target multiple organs, including the skin. COVID-19 rashes may present in many forms and at different stages of the disease.

In our app-based study, 8.8% of patients who were positive for COVID-19 via swab tests also reported skin rashes (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.42–1.97). Body rashes were more frequent than acral lesions (6.8% vs. 3.1%), although their predictive value was similar (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.37–1.99 vs. 1.74, 95% CI 1.33–2.28, respectively). Interestingly, the OR for both types of rash was greater than for fever (OR 1.48), a widely used criterion to suggest testing. Reports of cases with both body rashes and acral lesions were rare (1.1%), suggesting different pathogenesis, with the former caused by immunological reactions to the virus, and the latter more likely explained by delayed small thrombotic occlusions or damage to vessel walls.

### The new antibiotics [^117KEgUa]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2000). Low credibility.

It is easy to become overwhelmed by the amount of information available on the new antibiotics and difficult to keep abreast of the appropriate indications for each of them. For most patients with community-acquired infections, the first-line agent is usually not one of the newer agents but a standard regimen, or at times, no antibiotic at all. The development of resistance is likely to parallel the extent to which these agents are prescribed. They should be used only when standard treatment fails, when compliance with treatment is a real and serious issue, or when the patient has a real allergic reaction to the standard regimen.

### Common pediatric and adolescent skin conditions [^112143Jm]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Skin lesions are encountered in all areas of medicine, making it essential for physicians to understand the fundamentals of describing and diagnosing common skin conditions. The article begins with a discussion on the description and documentation of skin lesions based on color, size, morphology, and distribution. Pigmentation disorders such as vitiligo are depicted.

- **Cutaneous growths**: Growths found in the pediatric and adolescent population include acrochordons, dermatofibromas, keloids, milia, neurofibromas, and pyogenic granulomas. Treatment usually involves observation or curettage with electrodessication.

- **Scaling patches and plaques**: Psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, poison ivy, and eczema comprise scaling patches and plaques. Poison ivy and atopic dermatitis may also present with bullous and vesicular changes. Therapy typically consists of topical emollients and corticosteroids, while phototherapy is reserved for refractory cases.

- **Acne vulgaris**: This is the most common skin disease in the pediatric and adolescent population. This condition can be psychologically debilitating; therefore, proper treatment is of paramount importance. Therapeutic options include topical as well as oral antibiotics and retinoids. Extreme caution must be used when prescribing retinoids to post-pubescent females, as these agents are teratogenic.

- **Vascular anomalies**: These are most commonly exemplified by port wine stains and hemangiomas. Port wine stains may be treated with pulsed dye laser or may be observed if they are not of concern to the patient or physician. Hemangiomas typically spontaneously regress.

### Elidel [^112hduGE]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2020). High credibility.

Apply a thin layer of Elidel Cream, 1% to the affected skin twice daily. Patients should discontinue using Elidel Cream, 1% once signs and symptoms, such as itch, rash, and redness, resolve. They should be instructed on the appropriate actions to take if symptoms recur. If signs and symptoms persist beyond six weeks, patients should undergo a re-examination by their healthcare provider to confirm the diagnosis of atopic dermatitis.

Continuous long-term use of Elidel Cream, 1% should be avoided, and its application should be restricted to areas involved with atopic dermatitis [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)]. The safety of Elidel Cream, 1% when used under occlusion, which can promote systemic exposure, has not been evaluated, and its use with occlusive dressings should be avoided.

### ETFAD/EADV eczema task force 2020 position paper on diagnosis and treatment of atopic dermatitis in adults and children [^1157SH8S]. Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (2020). High credibility.

For diagnostic investigations of atopic dermatitis, specifically regarding allergy testing, the EADV/ETFAD 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining an allergy workup in patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. This includes serum IgE, skin prick tests, and patch tests for contact sensitization to ingredients of emollients and topical anti-inflammatory agents, depending on the individual's history. An allergy workup should also be considered in patients with mild atopic dermatitis depending on clinical suspicion.

### Amcinonide [^116Y4r2K]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Amcinonide belongs to the class of topical corticosteroids, which are primarily synthetic steroids used as anti-inflammatory and antipruritic agents.

- **Topical cream USP, 0.1%**: Each gram of Amcinonide Cream contains 1 mg of the active steroid amcinonide in a white, smooth, homogeneous, opaque emulsion. This emulsion is composed of benzyl alcohol (as a preservative), emulsifying wax, glycerin, isopropyl palmitate, lactic acid, purified water, and sorbitol solution 70%.

- **Topical ointment USP, 0.1%**: Each gram of Amcinonide Ointment contains 1 mg of the active steroid amcinonide in a specially formulated base. This base is composed of benzyl alcohol 2.2% (wt/wt) as a preservative, butylated hydroxyanisole, citric acid anhydrous, emulsifying wax, propyl gallate, propylene glycol, and white petrolatum.

Chemically, amcinonide is described as Pregna-1,4-diene-3,20-dione, 21-(acetyloxy)-16,17-[cyclopentylidenebis (oxy)]-9-fluoro-11-hydroxy-, (11β, 16α).

### Locoid [^1154F2LW]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Skin infections**: The use of topical corticosteroids, including Locoid Lotion, may delay healing or worsen concomitant skin infections. If skin infections are present or develop, an appropriate antimicrobial agent should be used. If a favorable response does not occur promptly, the use of Locoid Lotion should be discontinued until the infection has been adequately controlled [see Adverse Reactions (6)].

- **Allergic contact dermatitis**: The use of topical corticosteroids, including Locoid Lotion, can cause allergic contact dermatitis [see Adverse Reactions (6)]. Allergic contact dermatitis with corticosteroids is usually diagnosed by observing a failure to heal rather than noticing a clinical exacerbation. Such an observation should be corroborated with appropriate patch testing. Discontinue Locoid Lotion if the diagnosis is established.

### Chronic verrucous plaques on bilateral lower extremities [^117LEBJM]. JAAD case reports (2021). Low credibility.

Question 2: Which of the following is the most appropriate management option for this patient?
A. Topical corticosteroids
B. Intralesional corticosteroids
C. Systemic glucocorticoid therapy
D. Methotrexate
E. Antimalarials

Answers: A. Topical corticosteroids — Incorrect. For severe disfigurement, such as that seen in this patient, topical therapy is likely to be insufficient.
B. Intralesional corticosteroids — Incorrect. Intralesional therapy may be used for small skin lesions, such as those seen in papular cutaneous sarcoidosis, but it is unlikely to be effective for the treatment of large plaques.
C. Systemic glucocorticoid therapy — Correct. For rapidly progressing or severely disfiguring verrucous sarcoidosis, such as that seen in this patient, systemic glucocorticoid therapy is the first-line treatment option.
D. Methotrexate — Incorrect. Due to the extensive and severely disfiguring nature of this patient's lesions, systemic glucocorticoid therapy was chosen as the first-line treatment. Methotrexate is typically reserved for steroid-resistant sarcoidosis or for patients who are unable to tolerate the side effects of steroids. However, after initial improvement, one should consider adding methotrexate as a steroid-sparing agent while tapering the systemic glucocorticoids especially given this patient's history of diabetes mellitus.
E. Antimalarials — Incorrect. For rapidly progressing or severely disfiguring verrucous sarcoidosis, such as that seen in this patient, systemic glucocorticoid therapy is the first-line treatment option. Antimalarials may be considered as an adjun

### Treatment and diagnostic challenges associated with the novel and rapidly emerging antifungal-resistant dermatophyte [^114NH4T8]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2025). Low credibility.

It is speculated that the misuse of topical glucocorticoids and antimycotic/antibiotic fixed-dose combination creams, frequently containing potent steroids like clobetasol propionate, has led to the adaptation of T. indotineae infections and therapy recalcitrant dermatophytosis. These creams are widely accessible over the counter in India and other countries, such as those in Africa and the Middle East. They are affordable and often recommended by pharmacists. Prolonged steroid use often results in steroid-modified tinea lesions, such as tinea pseudoimbricata, leading to misdiagnosis and delays in treatment. Additionally, steroid misuse can cause systemic effects like Cushing's syndrome and contribute to recurrent and chronic dermatophytosis by potentially disrupting the skin microbiome and immune response.

T. indotineae has been present for more than a decade before it was first reported in India, as evidenced by the identification of a sequence corresponding to T. indotineae in a GenBank sequence deposited in 2004 from India. This isolate was from a human skin sample. T. indotineae sequences were also deposited in GenBank from other countries before the first report of chronic recalcitrant dermatophytosis in 2016. In 2008, sequences of T. indotineae were deposited as Arthroderma benhamiae from Japan and Australia. By 2017–2019, T. indotineae had replaced the previously dominant dermatophytes across India. However, there was variability in the terbinafine (TRB) resistance rate of T. indotineae between different regions of India. The national resistance rate overall was 72%.

### The generalized rash: part I. Differential diagnosis [^112QSrxp]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Physicians often have difficulty diagnosing a generalized rash because many different conditions produce similar rashes, and a single condition can result in different rashes with varied appearances. A rapid and accurate diagnosis is critically important to make treatment decisions, especially when mortality or significant morbidity can occur without prompt intervention. When a specific diagnosis is not immediately apparent, it is important to generate an inclusive differential diagnosis to guide diagnostic strategy and initial treatment.

In part I of this two-part article, tables listing common, uncommon, and rare causes of generalized rash are presented to help generate an inclusive differential diagnosis. The tables describe the key clinical features and recommended tests to help accurately diagnose generalized rashes. If the diagnosis remains unclear, the primary care physician must decide whether to observe and treat empirically, perform further diagnostic testing, or refer the patient to a dermatologist. This decision depends on the likelihood of a serious disorder and the patient's response to treatment.

### Differential diagnosis of severe cutaneous drug eruptions [^111L3Jgj]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Adverse cutaneous reactions to drugs are frequent, mostly secondary to antibacterials. However, serious adverse cutaneous reactions are infrequent. Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) are a spectrum of the same disease and represent the more severe drug eruptions, with a mortality rate around 30% for TEN.

The confusion between erythema multiforme major and SJS means that erythema multiforme major is the main differential diagnosis. Skin disorders involving desquamation, particularly after pustulosis, are also common differential diagnoses. Mechanical or autoimmune blistering are potential misdiagnoses of TEN/SJS. Hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS), or drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS), is a severe cutaneous drug reaction often characterized by a prolonged duration of eruption and involvement of other organs.

Exfoliative dermatitis, whether caused by psoriasis, dermatitis, or lymphoma, can be considered a differential diagnosis of DRESS/HSS. Additionally, angio-immunoblastic lymphadenopathy, viral eruption, and vasculitis are other differential diagnoses of DRESS/HSS. Prompt recognition of a severe drug reaction and withdrawal of the culprit drug is often the most important therapeutic action. Conversely, a delay in starting specific treatment for a disease misdiagnosed as a drug eruption could be deleterious.

### Vanos [^115Ezft4]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Vanos Cream is a corticosteroid indicated for the relief of the inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses in patients 12 years of age or older.

- **Indications**: Vanos® (fluocinonide) Cream, 0.1% is indicated for the relief of inflammatory and pruritic manifestations of corticosteroid-responsive dermatoses in patients 12 years of age or older [see use in specific populations (8.4)].

- **Limitation of use**: Treatment beyond 2 consecutive weeks is not recommended, and the total dosage should not exceed 60 g per week due to the potential for the drug to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The safety of Vanos Cream for use longer than 2 weeks has not been established. Therapy should be discontinued once control of the disease is achieved. If no improvement is observed within 2 weeks, reassessment of the diagnosis may be necessary. Do not use more than half of the 120 g tube per week. Vanos Cream should not be used in the treatment of rosacea or perioral dermatitis, and should not be applied to the face, groin, or axillae.

### Management of patients with a history of allergy to beta-lactam antibiotics [^117LPCsj]. The American Journal of Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Patients with a history of penicillin allergy present a treatment dilemma. Unnecessary avoidance of this relatively non-toxic class of drugs exposes the patient to potentially more toxic drugs, increases health care costs, and contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance. However, for those who truly have an allergy or other serious adverse reactions to beta-lactams, the use of alternate drugs is necessary. This article reviews management strategies to determine which patients are suitable candidates for the reintroduction of beta-lactams and which patients should continue to avoid them.

### Occupational skin disease [^113WrcbU]. American Family Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Contact dermatitis, the most common occupational skin disease, is characterized by clearly demarcated areas of rash at sites of exposure. The rash improves upon removal of the offending agent. In allergic contact dermatitis, even minute exposures to antigenic substances can lead to a skin rash. Common sensitizing agents include nickel and members of the Rhus genus (e.g. poison ivy, poison oak). Severe skin irritants tend to cause immediate red blisters or burns, whereas weaker irritants produce eczematous skin changes over time.

An occupational cause should be suspected when a rash occurs in areas that are in contact with oil, grease, or other substances. Direct skin testing (patch or scratch) or radioallergosorbent testing may help to identify a specific trigger. Skin cancer can have an occupational link in workers with prolonged exposure to sunlight and certain chemicals, although it can take decades for lesions to develop. In workers with occupational skin disease, workplace changes and protective measures are important to prevent future exposure.
