## Question

How much do statins improve mortality in elderly

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how much statins improve mortality in elderly patients. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical context and definitions, especially primary versus secondary prevention and the age groups involved. Then, I should verify the highest-quality evidence, particularly meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials and large observational datasets. Next, I will quantify mortality benefits by prevention type and age, and I should double-check absolute versus relative risk reductions. After that, I need to consider modifiers such as frailty, competing risks, and time-to-benefit. Finally, I will integrate guideline positions and translate this into practical, patient-centered recommendations with explicit uncertainties and shared decision-making language.

> Let me first confirm the clinical frame. "Elderly" here generally means adults aged 75 years and older, though some analyses extend to 65 and older; I need to distinguish secondary prevention (established ASCVD) from primary prevention (no prior ASCVD), because benefits differ meaningfully between these settings and are sensitive to baseline risk and competing mortality risks [^6545a899] [^5e68118a].

> Next, I should review the highest-quality evidence. The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration (CTT) individual participant data meta-analysis of 28 RCTs including 14,483 participants older than 75 years found that statins reduce major vascular events by about 21% per 1 mmol/L LDL-C reduction, with a 12% proportional reduction in vascular mortality and no effect on non-vascular mortality; importantly, the proportional risk reduction in major vascular events did not significantly diminish with age, though the absolute benefit is larger at older ages due to higher baseline risk [^6545a899] [^f52cc65a] [^e6bbb689].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about all-cause mortality in primary prevention. I initially thought the CTT showed a clear all-cause mortality reduction in those over 75 without ASCVD, but wait, let me verify the primary prevention signal. The CTT authors explicitly note less definitive direct evidence for primary prevention in patients older than 75 without occlusive vascular disease, and when heart failure/dialysis trials are excluded, the trend toward smaller relative risk reductions with age persists for coronary events, reinforcing that the mortality benefit is less certain in this subgroup [^6545a899] [^f52cc65a] [^e6bbb689].

> I will now examine secondary prevention, where the signal is strongest. In older adults with established ASCVD, statins consistently reduce all-cause mortality. A hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis of 9 RCTs in patients 65–82 years showed a 22% relative risk reduction in all-cause mortality with an NNT of 28 over 5 years, and the LIPID trial subgroup of patients 65–75 years showed a 21% mortality reduction with even larger absolute benefits due to higher baseline risk; these effects align with the CTT's vascular mortality reduction and support robust benefits in secondary prevention [^adc9e8d0] [^151e490e] [^6545a899].

> For primary prevention in those 75 and older, I should double-check the magnitude and certainty. Observational data suggest potential mortality benefit, but confounding is a concern. A large VA cohort of 326,981 veterans aged 75+ without ASCVD found new statin use associated with lower all-cause mortality (HR around 0.68–0.87 depending on interval), even in those over 90 and with dementia, though this remains observational and susceptible to immortal time and healthy-user bias [^ca58f7dc]. By contrast, randomized data are limited: PROSPER's primary prevention subgroup did not show reduced all-cause mortality, and ALLHAT-LLT in adults 75+ suggested a nonsignificant increase in mortality with pravastatin, underscoring uncertainty and the need for ongoing RCTs like STAREE and PREVENTABLE [^96bc0293] [^9df803fe] [^7a27e0d6].

> Let me quantify absolute benefits where I can. In secondary prevention, the Bayesian meta-analysis estimates an NNT of 28 for all-cause mortality over 5 years in older adults, and the LIPID analysis estimated 45 deaths prevented per 1000 older patients treated over 6 years. In primary prevention, absolute benefits are smaller and less certain; a meta-analysis of 21 trials reported an absolute mortality reduction of 0.8% with statins, but this pooled estimate includes younger populations and is not specific to adults over 75, so I should be cautious extrapolating to the oldest old [^adc9e8d0] [^151e490e] [^54c24637].

> I need to ensure I account for modifiers that can blunt apparent benefit. Competing non-cardiovascular mortality rises with age, which can attenuate the relative impact of statins on all-cause outcomes; meta-regression suggests smaller mortality benefits in populations with higher non-CV mortality, and frailty, multimorbidity, and limited life expectancy further complicate risk–benefit assessments in the very old [^e44fcdf] [^5e8d1d21]. Time-to-benefit matters too: for primary prevention, the time to prevent one MACE is about 2.5 years, so if life expectancy is shorter than that, the net benefit is questionable, reinforcing individualized decisions in adults over 75 [^83550547] [^ff393fb2].

> Next, I should review guideline positions to anchor practice. The USPSTF issues an I statement for statins for primary prevention in adults 76 and older due to insufficient evidence, while the ESC/EAS suggests considering statins for primary prevention in high- and very-high-risk patients older than 75 years; the National Lipid Association/American Geriatrics Society consensus emphasizes shared decision-making incorporating life expectancy, frailty, and patient preferences, and supports considering statins in appropriately selected adults over 75 without life-limiting illness [^5e68118a] [^78fc1e55] [^2e539afb] [^afee112a].

> But wait, what if we consider LDL-C lowering more broadly, not just statins. A 2020 meta-analysis of LDL-lowering therapies (statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors) in patients 75 and older showed a 26% reduction in major vascular events per 1 mmol/L LDL-C reduction, with no significant difference versus younger adults, supporting the biological plausibility that LDL lowering benefits older patients, though mortality data were not separately reported and many included patients had established disease [^3621ace7].

> I should also confirm safety signals that might offset benefit. Large meta-analyses and the CTT show no increase in cancer or non-vascular mortality with statins, and muscle symptoms are generally uncommon in RCTs, though observational data in older adults report higher rates of myalgias and polypharmacy concerns; nonetheless, serious adverse events are not increased in pooled RCT analyses, which supports the overall favorable safety profile in appropriately selected older adults [^6545a899] [^5f11b3d0].

> Let me synthesize and be explicit about uncertainties. In adults 75 and older with established ASCVD, statins reduce all-cause mortality by roughly 20–25% with substantial absolute benefit, and this is high-certainty evidence. In adults 75 and older without ASCVD, there is a credible but uncertain mortality benefit; observational data suggest potential benefit, but randomized data are sparse and inconsistent, so any mortality gain is likely modest and highly dependent on baseline risk, life expectancy, and frailty, warranting shared decision-making and consideration of coronary artery calcium or other risk enhancers to refine benefit [^adc9e8d0] [^6545a899] [^ca58f7dc] [^5e68118a].

> Practically, I should confirm a stepwise approach. First, distinguish secondary from primary prevention. Second, estimate life expectancy and frailty. Third, discuss absolute risk reductions, time-to-benefit, and potential harms. Fourth, consider risk enhancers such as CAC in borderline cases. And fifth, revisit decisions periodically as function and preferences change, aligning with the principle that preventive therapies are most appropriate when life expectancy exceeds time-to-benefit and the patient values the potential gains [^2e539afb] [^afee112a] [^83550547].

Statins reduce mortality in older adults, with the clearest benefit in **secondary prevention** [^adc9e8d0] (established ASCVD) and a smaller, debated benefit in **primary prevention** [^5e68118a] (no prior ASCVD). In secondary prevention, statins reduce all-cause mortality by about 20–30% [^adc9e8d0] and cardiovascular mortality by about 30% [^adc9e8d0]. In primary prevention, meta-analyses show no significant reduction in all-cause mortality [^fc9ff8c4] in adults ≥ 65 years, though some observational studies suggest lower mortality in adults ≥ 75 years [^ca58f7dc]. Benefits are greatest in those with higher baseline risk and longer life expectancy [^e6bbb689]; in frailty, multimorbidity, or limited life expectancy, the net benefit is uncertain [^afee112a] and decisions should be individualized [^2e539afb].

---

## Secondary prevention: established ASCVD

In older adults with established ASCVD, statins provide **robust mortality benefits**:

- **All-cause mortality**: Reduced by ~22% (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.65–0.89) [^adc9e8d0].
- **Cardiovascular mortality**: Reduced by ~30% (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53–0.83) [^adc9e8d0].
- **Absolute benefit**: Greater in older adults due to higher baseline risk; NNT ~28 to prevent one death over 5 years [^adc9e8d0].

These benefits are consistent across ages, including patients > 75 years [^6545a899], and are supported by multiple meta-analyses and large RCTs [^e6bbb689].

---

## Primary prevention: no established ASCVD

In older adults without established ASCVD, the **mortality benefit is less clear**:

- **RCT evidence**: Meta-analyses of RCTs in adults ≥ 65 years show no significant reduction in all-cause mortality (RR 0.941, 95% CI 0.856–1.035) [^fc9ff8c4].
- **Observational data**: Some large observational studies suggest lower all-cause mortality with statins in adults ≥ 75 years [^ca58f7dc], but these are subject to confounding and selection bias [^c28c480c].
- **Guidelines**: USPSTF gives an I statement for adults ≥ 76 years due to insufficient evidence [^5e68118a]; ESC/EAS suggests considering statins for high/very high-risk patients > 75 years [^78fc1e55].

---

## Factors influencing benefit

Several factors modify the **magnitude of benefit** in older adults:

| **Factor** | **Influence on benefit** |
|-|-|
| Baseline cardiovascular risk | Higher risk yields greater absolute benefit [^e6bbb689] |
| Life expectancy | Longer expectancy increases net benefit [^83550547] |
| Frailty, multimorbidity, dementia | Competing risks may blunt benefit; individualize decisions [^afee112a] |
| Statin intensity | Moderate-intensity statins are generally recommended in older adults [^13e3146c] |

---

## Safety considerations

Statins are generally well tolerated in older adults, but **clinicians should monitor for**:

- **Muscle symptoms**: More common in older adults; monitor CK if symptomatic [^e516493f].
- **Drug interactions**: Common due to polypharmacy; review medications carefully [^13e3146c].
- **Cognitive effects**: No consistent evidence of significant cognitive harm [^5e68118a].

---

## Clinical implications and recommendations

- **Secondary prevention**: Strongly recommend statins in older adults with established ASCVD, regardless of age [^6545a899].
- **Primary prevention**: Consider statins in adults ≥ 75 years with high cardiovascular risk and reasonable life expectancy; use shared decision-making [^2e539afb] [^78fc1e55].
- **Frailty or limited life expectancy**: Avoid routine statin initiation; focus on comfort and quality of life [^afee112a].

---

Statins reduce mortality in older adults, with **clear benefit in secondary prevention** and a smaller, context-dependent benefit in primary prevention. Decisions should be individualized based on baseline risk, life expectancy, frailty, and patient preferences [^2e539afb].

### Do statins reduce mortality in older people? Findings from a longitudinal study using primary care records [^69ca4301]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Assess whether statins reduce mortality in the general population aged 60 years and above.

Design

Retrospective cohort study.

Setting

Primary care practices contributing to The Health Improvement Network database, England and Wales, 1990–2017.

Participants

Cohort who turned age 60 between 1990 and 2000 with no previous cardiovascular disease or statin prescription and followed up until 2017.

Results

Current statin prescription was associated with a significant reduction in all-cause mortality from age 65 years onward, with greater reductions seen at older ages. The adjusted HRs of mortality associated with statin prescription at ages 65, 70, 75, 80 and 85 years were 0.76 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.81), 0.71 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.75), 0.68 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.72), 0.63 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.73) and 0.54 (95% CI 0.33 to 0.92), respectively. The adjusted HRs did not vary by sex or cardiac risk.

Conclusions

Using regularly updated clinical information on sequential treatment decisions in older people, mortality predictions were updated every 6 months until age 85 years in a combined primary and secondary prevention population. The consistent mortality reduction of statins from age 65 years onward supports their use where clinically indicated at age 75 and older, where there has been particular uncertainty of the benefits.

### Lipid-lowering therapy in patients 75 years and older: clinical priority or superfluous therapy? [^8e0d662d]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

The incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular (CV)-related morbidity and mortality significantly increase with age. In the elderly, hypercholesterolemia with elevated total and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol is a significant predictor of incident and recurrent CV disease. Multiple lines of evidence have established the benefit of statin therapy to lower cholesterol levels and reduce the risk of CV events as well as prevent progression of subclinical atherosclerotic disease. Elderly patients, particularly those older than 75 years, have not been well represented in randomized clinical trials evaluating lipid lowering therapy. The limited available data from clinical trials do support the benefit of statin therapy in the elderly population. Based upon these data, cholesterol treatment guidelines endorse statin therapy as the primary treatment of hypercholesterolemia in elderly patients, though caution is recommended given the greater number of co-morbid conditions and concern for poly-pharmacy common in the elderly. Additional research is needed to better establish the benefit of statin therapy in the elderly within the context of reducing CV risk, minimizing side effects, and improving overall quality of life.

### Do statins reduce mortality in older people? Findings from a longitudinal study using primary care records [^0b0b695a]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study showed significant absolute and relative reductions in all-cause mortality associated with statins for primary and secondary prevention of CVD at all ages over 65 years, including those at age 75 or older, in routine clinical practice over 25 years. This supports the use of statins, where clinically indicated and after discussion of the potential risks and benefits with the patient, in those aged over 75 years.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the biggest cause of death from non-communicable disease in the world. Clinical guidelines internationally recommend statin therapy for both primary and secondary prevention of CVD, making statins one of the most frequently prescribed drugs in industrialised countries. Yet uncertainty remains about the benefits of statin therapy in older people, particularly those aged 75 years or older who do not have a history of CVD, due to relatively few older people being included in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). In 2019, the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration published a meta-analysis of 28 randomised trials of statin therapy in older people. They found a trend towards smaller relative reductions in cardiac events and vascular mortality with increasing age, and no effect on non-vascular mortality. Their risk ratios, however, were inappropriately presented as per mmol/L reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL, 'bad cholesterol'), making it difficult to compare with findings of other studies, and their data have not been made available for scrutiny. A recent meta-analysis of RCTs and a contemporary cohort showed the efficacy of LDL lowering treatment for primary prevention of cardiovascular events for patients aged 75 or older. However, another study found that low and high levels of LDL was associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality, questioning the safety of cholesterol-lowering. The persistent uncertainty about the benefits and risks of statins in those aged over 75 is being addressed by trials including the STAREE trial, which is examining whether statin therapy will reduce all-cause mortality among healthy older people (≥ 70 years), with an estimated study completion date of December 2023.

### Benefits of statins in elderly subjects without established cardiovascular disease: a meta-analysis [^fc9ff8c4]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Objectives

The purpose of this paper was to assess whether statins reduce all-cause mortality and cardiovascular (CV) events in elderly people without established CV disease.

Background

Because of population aging, prevention of CV disease in the elderly is relevant. In elderly patients with previous CV events, the use of statins is recommended by guidelines, whereas the benefits of these drugs in elderly subjects without previous CV events are still debated.

Methods

Randomized trials comparing statins versus placebo and reporting all-cause and CV mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and new cancer onset in elderly subjects (age ≥ 65 years) without established CV disease were included.

Results

Eight trials enrolling 24,674 subjects (42.7% females; mean age 73.0 ± 2.9 years; mean follow up 3.5 ± 1.5 years) were included in analyses. Statins, compared with placebo, significantly reduced the risk of MI by 39.4% (relative risk [RR]: 0.606 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.434 to 0.847]; p = 0.003) and the risk of stroke by 23.8% (RR: 0.762 [95% CI: 0.626 to 0.926]; p = 0.006). In contrast, the risk of all-cause death (RR: 0.941 [95% CI: 0.856 to 1.035]; p = 0.210) and of CV death (RR: 0.907 [95% CI: 0.686 to 1.199]; p = 0.493) were not significantly reduced. New cancer onset did not differ between statin- and placebo-treated subjects (RR: 0.989 [95% CI: 0.851 to 1.151]; p = 0.890).

Conclusions

In elderly subjects at high CV risk without established CV disease, statins significantly reduce the incidence of MI and stroke, but do not significantly prolong survival in the short-term.

### Is aggressive lipid-lowering effective and safe in the older adult? [^80f5ec08]. Clinical Cardiology (2005). Low credibility.

With improvements in diet and health care over the last several decades, the elderly have become the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population. Along with this progress, however, has come increasing morbidity, much of which is attributable to cardiovascular disease, and which is burdensome both to patients and to the health-care system. New medications, including HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have the potential to prevent or delay the progression of disease and vascular events. Large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials continue to show that elderly patients benefit from statin therapy and that aggressive therapy is generally very safe in this population; however, statins remain under-used in older individuals. This paper reviews the benefits of statin therapy in the elderly and discusses the reality versus the perception of risk, selection of appropriate patients, and ways in which any risks that may exist can be minimized further.

### Are statins indicated in senior citizens? A review of statin therapy in the elderly [^722655c0]. The American Journal of Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

The use of statin therapy in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) has demonstrated substantial improvement in morbidity and mortality of the aging population. Despite exhaustive studies demonstrating the benefits of statin therapy linking lower cholesterol levels to decreased vascular events, statin guidelines vary greatly with age, and recommendations are unclear regarding initiation and discontinuation of statin therapy in patients 65 years and older. Data suggest that statins are highly effective at secondary prevention of major cardiovascular events and development of coronary heart disease in patients with a history of vascular disease or risk factors such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or smoking. Therefore, patients who meet these criteria, regardless of age, should begin statin therapy. There is also some evidence to suggest that statin therapy may be beneficial in primary prevention of major cardiovascular events, although these data are not as well studied as secondary prevention use of statin therapy, and should therefore be individualized for each patient.

### Statin therapy for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: cons [^e839ae8f]. Atherosclerosis (2022). Medium credibility.

While recent decades have seen substantial reductions in cardiovascular mortality, heart disease remains the number one cause of death both in the United States and globally. This has led many to advocate for prescribing statins even more widely, including to patients with low risk of cardiovascular disease, based on the hypothesis that any reduction in lipid levels will eventually translate to a reduction in the development of atherosclerosis and thus to subsequent mortality. However, empirical evidence to date has not substantiated the hoped for benefits of this strategy. When healthy patients without cardiovascular disease are prescribed statins they do not live longer, and they have only a marginal reduction in the risk of ischemic events. Furthermore, statins cause numerous side effects which substantially limit their net benefit. These tradeoffs are even more lopsided in elderly patients treated for primary prevention, in whom statin therapy does not lead to a reduction in mortality or ischemic events and has the potential for significant harms. Strategies to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease should therefore avoid a focus on cholesterol levels and subsequent pharmacological therapy and should instead redouble efforts to improve the lifestyle factors that are far more consequential to the development of cardiovascular disease and overall good health.

### Statins in the elderly: a patient-focused approach [^13e3146c]. Clinical Cardiology (2015). Low credibility.

Individuals age > 65 years represent the fastest-growing subpopulation in the United States. Although these individuals with the highest cardiovascular risk profile would be anticipated to be the most aggressively treated, paradoxically, treatment and baseline risk are inversely related. Presumably, the elderly population would benefit from high-intensity statin therapy; however, as per the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, given the scarcity of evidence in patients age > 75, there are only sufficient data from randomized controlled trials to support use of moderate-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention. Despite evidence demonstrating statins are beneficial in the elderly, the decision to initiate and sustain treatment should be a well-informed and collaborative decision. One must balance the benefits (secondary atherosclerotic cardiovascular prevention, stroke reduction, decreased morbidity and mortality) with the potential risks to the elderly (altered metabolism, comorbidities, polypharmacy and drug-drug interactions, side effects, cognitive limitations, and cost).

### Is it time for a cardiovascular primary prevention trial in the elderly? [^f75997f7]. Stroke (2007). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Statins have been shown conclusively to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in subjects with clinical cardiovascular disease or diabetes aged 65 to 80 years of age. However, few data are available for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in those aged ≥ 70 years.

Summary Of Review

A moderate-dose statin was of little benefit in a population aged 70 to 82 years when given for 3 years in the setting of suboptimally treated blood pressure. More evidence supports the use of blood pressure-lowering medications, but few data are available regarding the appropriate blood pressure target and most effective agents in the elderly. Some evidence also suggests that the elderly could experience higher mortality with antihypertensive treatment. These findings, along with greater safety concerns and an increasing number of competing risks and medical conditions with advancing age, make it imperative to carefully evaluate the risk/benefit balance from treating hypercholesterolemia and hypertension in persons aged ≥ 70 years.

Conclusions

We propose a 5-year 2x2 factorial trial of primary prevention in the elderly that will (1) evaluate whether statin therapy will reduce the risk of cardiovascular events when added to the treatment of hypertension to achieve a blood pressure < 140/90 mm Hg in most patients and (2) determine the most appropriate blood pressure regimen for the prevention of cardiovascular and renal events.

### Do statins reduce mortality in older people? Findings from a longitudinal study using primary care records [^23eb7e6f]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2021). Medium credibility.

Results

Study population

The study population comprised 110 243 patients ages 60 years with 38% entering the study in 1990–1995 (born in 1930–1935) and the remaining 62% in 1996–2000 (born in 1936–1940) (table 1). The median follow-up was 16.6 years and maximum for 27 years, with 78 728 (71%) participating at age 75 (online supplemental table S3). During the follow-up, the cardiac risk of the study population increased, largely driven by age (online supplemental table S4). The overall mortality rate per year during follow-up was 120 per 10 000 people, where death was observed in 20% of the study population by the end of the study period.

Table 1
Characteristics of the study population

The proportion of current statin prescription increased greatly between 1995 and 2010 and roughly stabilised afterwards, with differences seen by cardiac risk, sex, and age (figure 1). In 2015, current statin prescription in 75 year olds at low, medium and high cardiac risk was 10%, 35% and 75%, respectively.

Figure 1
Proportion of current statin prescription by cardiac risk, sex and age during the study period.

The cumulative years of statin prescription increased during the follow-up and were greater in the younger birth cohort (online supplemental figure S2). The median (IQR) statin exposure in those with a current prescription at age 75 and born in 1930–1935 or 1936–1940 was 4 (2–7) years or 6 (3–9) years, respectively. Approximately 90% of patients with a current statin prescription adhered at least 75% of follow-up time (S3 Figure). By the end of the study period, 51% of the study population were never prescribed statins, 41% were prescribed at some age and stayed on statins, 6% were prescribed statins and subsequently stopped statins permanently and 2% initially stopped statins but came back on, including 0.5% who had four or more switches. The cumulative years of statin prescription in patients with no current statin prescription at a landmark also showed minimal crossover of treatment (online supplemental figure S4).

### Statins for secondary prevention in elderly patients: a hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis [^adc9e8d0]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study was designed to determine whether statins reduce all-cause mortality in elderly patients with coronary heart disease.

Background

Statins continue to be underutilized in elderly patients because evidence has not consistently shown that they reduce mortality.

Methods

We searched 5 electronic databases, the Internet, and conference proceedings to identify relevant trials. In addition, we obtained unpublished data for the elderly patient subgroups from 4 trials and for the secondary prevention subgroup from the PROSPER (PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk) trial. Inclusion criteria were randomized allocation to statin or placebo, documented coronary heart disease, ≥ 50 elderly patients (defined as age ≥ 65 years), and ≥ 6 months of follow-up. Data were analyzed with hierarchical Bayesian modeling.

Results

We included 9 trials encompassing 19,569 patients with an age range of 65 to 82 years. Pooled rates of all-cause mortality were 15.6% with statins and 18.7% with placebo. We estimated a relative risk reduction of 22% over 5 years (relative risk [RR] 0.78; 95% credible interval [CI] 0.65 to 0.89). Furthermore, statins reduced coronary heart disease mortality by 30% (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.83), nonfatal myocardial infarction by 26% (RR 0.74; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.89), need for revascularization by 30% (RR 0.70; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.83), and stroke by 25% (RR 0.75; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.94). The posterior median estimate of the number needed to treat to save 1 life was 28 (95% CI 15 to 56).

Conclusions

Statins reduce all-cause mortality in elderly patients and the magnitude of this effect is substantially larger than had been previously estimated.

### What do the statins tell us? [^dfcf1032]. American Heart Journal (2002). Low credibility.

Until the recent introduction of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), the potential effect of cholesterol lowering on the prevention of clinical manifestations of coronary disease was a matter of debate. In trials conducted before the introduction of statins, cholesterol levels were lowered, on average, by only approximately 10%, resulting in prevention of coronary events but with no effect on total mortality rates. However, statins have been able to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by a mean of roughly 28%, significantly decreasing both relative and absolute risk levels of coronary events and total mortality. These benefits have been demonstrated not only in middle-aged men but also in women and patients aged > 65 years. Aggressive cholesterol lowering has also been shown to yield larger decreases in the incidence of subsequent coronary events than angioplasty, and to reduce the occurrence of such events in patients who have undergone coronary artery bypass graft surgery, which raises the question of whether these procedures should be relegated to symptom relief, with cholesterol lowering as the primary means of coronary heart disease event prevention. Statins, therefore, have unequivocally shown the importance of cholesterol lowering in the prevention of morbidity and mortality due to coronary disease. Ongoing research will elucidate the role of statin therapy in the prevention of strokes and in the treatment of patients aged > 75 years, and future trials will be needed to evaluate the potential role of statins in primary prevention for younger populations who cannot control cholesterol with lifestyle changes.

### Association of statin use in older people primary prevention group with risk of cardiovascular events and mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies [^25e62e61]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the major cause of mortality worldwide. More than 80% of the overall CVD death occurs in older people (aged ≥ 65 years). In 2015, people aged ≥ 65 years represented 8.5% (617.1 million) of the global population (7.3 billion). In 2030, this percentage is projected to reach 12% (1 billion) of the world population. In Europe, it is projected that almost 25% of its population will be aged ≥ 65 years by 2030, higher than any of the other continents. Therefore, efforts at the prevention of CVD in older people are important and will influence global healthcare policies.

The consideration of statins for primary CVD prevention in older people represents a dilemma in clinical practice unlike the secondary prevention, which is well-established and supported by a level (A) evidence, according to the most recent European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) guidelines. Current evidence on the use of statins for primary prevention of CVD in older people (especially those aged > 75 years) is still lacking. Statin therapy for primary prevention in people aged > 75 years (at high risk) was supported by level (B) evidence and considered as a class IIb recommendation in the 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines on dyslipidemias. The 2019 ESC/EAS guidelines advocate statins for primary prevention in older people aged ≤ 75 years (i.e. 65 to 75 years) as a class I recommendation, which is unlike the 2016 guidelines with a class ΙΙa recommendation and level (B) evidence. This change in recommendation class was based on an individual participant level-meta-analysis from 28 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) by the "Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration" that reported a significant 39% proportional reduction [rate ratio (RR) 0.61; 99% confidence interval (CI) 0.51 to 0.73] in major vascular events for every 1 mmol/L drop in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by statins (or more intensive statin therapy) in participants without vascular disease, aged > 65 and ≤ 70 years. This beneficial effect of statins was statistically insignificant for primary prevention in participants aged > 70 years.

### Overuse of statins in older adults… [^260c11fb]. AAFP (2019). Medium credibility.

The study found no improvement in CAD or mortality in the pravastatin arm despite decreases in LDL cholesterol. There was also a trend toward higher mortality with statins in those older than 75 years. Subgroup analyses of people older than 75 in other studies have shown variable benefits of statins on cardiovascular outcomes and no reductions in mortality.
4. Many older people are prescribed statins for primary prevention despite potential adverse effects and no evidence of effectiveness. In a study of patients older than 80 years in an integrated health system, 22% of them received a statin, 71% of whom were at low risk of CAD, and most of whom were treated to LDL levels of 90 mg per dL or lower. 5 A national survey showed that the percentage of older people treated with statins for primary prevention increased from 8. 8% in 2000 to 34% in 2012.
4.

6 A total of 5, 804 patients 70 to 82 years of age with a history of CAD were randomized to 40 mg of pravastatin per day or placebo and were followed for three years. The primary endpoint occurred in 21 out of 1, 000 fewer pravastatin users compared with those using placebo; however, there was no reduction in overall mortality. 7 When patients in the PROSPER study were followed for eight years, those taking pravastatin had no reduction in cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, or death compared with those taking placebo. 8 A recent retrospective cohort study that researched the impact of statins on older people with diabetes mellitus showed a small statin benefit in those 75 to 85 years of age. 9 Over 10 years, 1. 8 out of 1, 000 fewer statin users developed CAD compared with those using placebo, and 13 out of 1, 000 fewer statin users died.

There was no benefit for people older than 85 years. A Bayesian meta-analysis of people older than 65 who had an active diagnosis of CAD also showed a small statin benefit over five years. 10 However, few people in this study were older than 80 years.

### Statin therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^6e8e728a]. JAMA (2013). Excellent credibility.

Clinical Question

Do statins reduce rates of cardiovascular events when used for primary prevention?

Bottom Line

When used for primary prevention, statins are associated with lower rates of all-cause mortality, major vascular events, and revascularizations compared with placebo. Statin therapy is not associated with increased rates of life-threatening adverse effects such as cancer.

### Primary prevention with statins in the Elderly [^3002a02c]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2018). Low credibility.

The burden of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) in high-income countries is mostly borne by the elderly. With increasing life expectancy, clear guidance on sensible use of statin therapy to prevent a first and potentially devastating ASCVD event is critically important to ensure a healthy aging population. Since 2013, 5 major North American and European guidelines on statin use in primary prevention of ASCVD have been released by the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association, the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, and the European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society. Guidance on using statin therapy in primary ASCVD prevention in the growing elderly population (> 65 years of age) differs markedly. The authors discuss the discrepant recommendations, place them into the context of available evidence, and identify circumstances in which uncertainty may hamper the appropriate use of statins in the elderly.

### Efficacy and safety of statin therapy in older people: a meta-analysis of individual participant data from 28 randomised controlled trials [^6545a899]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Summary

Background

Statin therapy has been shown to reduce major vascular events and vascular mortality in a wide range of individuals, but there is uncertainty about its efficacy and safety among older people. We undertook a meta-analysis of data from all large statin trials to compare the effects of statin therapy at different ages.

Methods

In this meta-analysis, randomised trials of statin therapy were eligible if they aimed to recruit at least 1000 participants with a scheduled treatment duration of at least 2 years. We analysed individual participant data from 22 trials (n = 134 537) and detailed summary data from one trial (n = 12 705) of statin therapy versus control, plus individual participant data from five trials of more intensive versus less intensive statin therapy (n = 39 612). We subdivided participants into six age groups (55 years or younger, 56–60 years, 61–65 years, 66–70 years, 71–75 years, and older than 75 years). We estimated effects on major vascular events (ie, major coronary events, strokes, and coronary revascularisations), cause-specific mortality, and cancer incidence as the rate ratio (RR) per 1·0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol. We compared proportional risk reductions in different age subgroups by use of standard χ 2 tests for heterogeneity when there were two groups, or trend when there were more than two groups.

Findings

14 483 (8%) of 186 854 participants in the 28 trials were older than 75 years at randomisation, and the median follow-up duration was 4·9 years. Overall, statin therapy or a more intensive statin regimen produced a 21% (RR 0·79, 95% CI 0·77–0·81) proportional reduction in major vascular events per 1·0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol. We observed a significant reduction in major vascular events in all age groups. Although proportional reductions in major vascular events diminished slightly with age, this trend was not statistically significant (p trend = 0·06). Overall, statin or more intensive therapy yielded a 24% (RR 0·76, 95% CI 0·73–0·79) proportional reduction in major coronary events per 1·0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol, and with increasing age, we observed a trend towards smaller proportional risk reductions in major coronary events (p trend = 0·009). We observed a 25% (RR 0·75, 95% CI 0·73–0·78) proportional reduction in the risk of coronary revascularisation procedures with statin therapy or a more intensive statin regimen per 1·0 mmol/L lower LDL cholesterol, which did not differ significantly across age groups (p trend = 0·6). Similarly, the proportional reductions in stroke of any type (RR 0·84, 95% CI 0·80–0·89) did not differ significantly across age groups (p trend = 0·7). After exclusion of four trials which enrolled only patients with heart failure or undergoing renal dialysis (among whom statin therapy has not been shown to be effective), the trend to smaller proportional risk reductions with increasing age persisted for major coronary events (p trend = 0·01), and remained non-significant for major vascular events (p trend = 0·3). The proportional reduction in major vascular events was similar, irrespective of age, among patients with pre-existing vascular disease (p trend = 0·2), but appeared smaller among older than among younger individuals not known to have vascular disease (p trend = 0·05). We found a 12% (RR 0·88, 95% CI 0·85–0·91) proportional reduction in vascular mortality per 1·0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol, with a trend towards smaller proportional reductions with older age (p trend = 0·004), but this trend did not persist after exclusion of the heart failure or dialysis trials (p trend = 0·2). Statin therapy had no effect at any age on non-vascular mortality, cancer death, or cancer incidence.

Interpretation

Statin therapy produces significant reductions in major vascular events irrespective of age, but there is less direct evidence of benefit among patients older than 75 years who do not already have evidence of occlusive vascular disease. This limitation is now being addressed by further trials.

### Association of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels with more than 20-year risk of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in the general population [^c23d2873]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2022). Medium credibility.

Furthermore, a clinical trial among older adults without baseline CVD demonstrated that statin treatment did not improve the adverse outcomes (eg, overall deaths, CVD deaths, CHD deaths and stroke deaths) for primary cardiovascular prevention. Guidelines also showed lower strength recommendations in older adults for statin uses than in younger adults. A meta‐analysis on benefits of statin in primary prevention, including 24 674 elderly subjects, demonstrated statin use did not significantly reduce the risk of all‐cause and CVD mortality. Another meta‐analysis of clinical trials showed that for people without vascular disease, net benefits of statins on cardiovascular events were found in adults younger than 70 years of age, not in adults older than 70 years. Notably, advanced age was the risk factor of the adverse outcomes of statin use, including diabetesand muscle symptoms. These studies highlighted that the role of age and statins use on adverse outcomes needed to be further investigated in future studies.

Implications of all the available evidence

Statins reduced vascular events irrespective of age, including in people older than 75 years. In the primary prevention setting, among people older than 75 years, there is less evidence of the effects of statin therapy. Ongoing trials are investigating this group directly.

### Starting primary prevention earlier with statins [^6c6544bc]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2014). Low credibility.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults was based on a systematic review of randomized trials with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) outcomes and meta-analyses of these trials published through 2011. With evidence of an ASCVD risk reduction benefit greatly outweighing the potential for adverse effects, the guideline recommends statin therapy for primary prevention in those with ≥ 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk and consideration of statin therapy in those with 5% to < 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk. Subsequent meta-analyses of the statin trials support these recommendations and have additionally found a reduction in total mortality in lower-risk subjects. Additional evidence from imaging trials and epidemiologic studies suggests that initiation of statin therapy earlier in the course of ASCVD could have the potential to more effectively prevent age-related progression of atherosclerosis. Given the high levels of suboptimal risk factors in adults and the safety and availability of low-cost generic statins, a consideration of all the available evidence strongly supports earlier intervention for the primary prevention of ASCVD. In conclusion, earlier initiation of statin therapy has the potential to have a large long-term impact on the heavy burden of cardiovascular disease in the aging populations.

### Efficacy and safety of statin therapy in older people: a meta-analysis of individual participant data from 28 randomised controlled trials [^e3bedd69]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Meta-analyses of individual participant data from 27 randomised trials in the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) Collaboration database indicate that each 1·0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol with statin therapy reduces the risk of major vascular events by about a fifth, with similar proportional risk reductions among men and women, and across different levels of absolute risk. However, even among patients with established cardiovascular disease, rates of use of statin therapy have been shown to decline with increasing age, and are substantially lower in people older than 75 years, reflecting differences in both prescribing and compliance. This decline is even more prominent among older patients with no evidence of occlusive vascular disease. One explanation for this observation might relate to uncertainty about applying the evidence for statin efficacy and safety from randomised trials to an older population, given that a relatively small number of people aged over 75 years were enrolled in such trials, and many older people have non-cardiovascular comorbidities. The CTT collaboration has age-specific data on vascular events, cause-specific mortality, and cancer from 28 randomised controlled trials of statin therapy among a total of nearly 187 000 participants, of whom about 14 500 were older than 75 years at baseline. We aimed to do a meta-analysis of data from all large statin trials to compare the effects of statin therapy at different ages and explore the effects of statin therapy among older individuals.

### Lipid-lowering agents in older individuals: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials [^5b0b7541]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

The efficacy of lipid-lowering agents on patient-important outcomes in older individuals is unclear.

Methods

We included randomized trials that enrolled individuals aged 65 years or older and that included at least 1 year of follow-up. Pairs of reviewers selected and appraised the trials.

Results

We included 23 trials that enrolled 60,194 elderly patients. For primary prevention, statins reduced the risk of coronary artery disease [CAD; relative risk (RR): 0.79, 95% CI: 0.68 to 0.91] and myocardial infarction (MI; RR: 0.45, 95% CI: 0.31 to 0.66) but not all-cause or cardiovascular mortality or stroke. These effects were imprecise in patients with diabetes, but there was no significant interaction between diabetes status and the intervention effect. For secondary prevention, statins reduced all-cause mortality (RR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.73 to 0.89), cardiovascular mortality (RR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.58 to 0.79), CAD (RR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.61 to 0.77), MI (RR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.59 to 0.79), and revascularization (RR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.61 to 0.77). Intensive (vs less-intensive) statin therapy reduced the risk of CAD and heart failure. Niacin did not reduce the risk of revascularization, and fibrates did not reduce the risk of stroke, cardiovascular mortality, or CAD.

Conclusion

High-certainty evidence supports statin use for secondary prevention in older individuals. Evidence for primary prevention is less certain. Data in older individuals with diabetes are limited; however, no empirical evidence has shown a significant difference based on diabetes status.

### Statins provide less benefit in populations with high noncardiovascular mortality risk: meta-regression of randomized controlled trials [^e44fc3df]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To examine whether the benefit of statins varied according to cardiovascular (CV) and non-CV mortality of the treated population.

Design

Meta-analysis and meta-regression of 16 randomized placebo-controlled trials.

Setting

Community and hospital.

Participants

Statin- (n = 59,671) and placebo-treated (n = 59,707) individuals with and without CV disease (mean age 55 to 75).

Measurements

Meta-regression was used to model relative risks (RRs) of major CV events (myocardial infarction and stroke) and total mortality for statins versus placebo as a function of CV and non-CV mortality risks of the study population.

Results

Every 1% increase in 5-year non-CV mortality risk of the study population was associated with a 3.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.2 to 6.3%) greater RR of major CV events and a 4.4% (95% CI = 2.1 to 6.9%) greater RR of total mortality. (Higher RRs indicate smaller benefits.) CV mortality was not associated with statin effects (P > .05). In stratified analysis according to CV (≥ 5.3% vs < 5.3%) and non-CV mortality (≥ 3.8% vs < 3.8%) of the study population, statins had little mortality benefit in populations with high non-CV mortality, regardless of CV mortality (random-effects pooled RR = 0.81, 95% CI = 0.72 to 0.91, for low CV and low non-CV mortality; random-effects pooled RR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.76 to 1.06 for low CV and high non-CV mortality; random-effects pooled RR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.72 to 0.87 for high CV and low non-CV mortality; random-effects pooled RR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.87 to 1.02 for high CV and high non-CV mortality). The CV event reduction was also attenuated in populations with high non-CV mortality (random-effects pooled RR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.60 to 0.75, for low CV and low non-CV mortality; random-effects pooled RR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.66 to 0.81 for low CV and high non-CV mortality; random-effects pooled RR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.69 to 0.87 for high CV and low non-CV mortality; random-effects pooled RR = 0.83, 95% CI = 0.74 to 0.92 for high CV and high non-CV mortality).

Conclusion

Benefits of statins may depend on the non-CV mortality risk of the treated population. This should be confirmed using individual-level data.

Suggestions for practice regarding the I statement — adults older than 75 years: According to national mortality data, heart disease and cerebrovascular disease were respectively the first and fourth leading causes of death in adults 65 years or older in 2018, yet trial data on benefits in persons older than 75 years are limited, and available evidence is insufficient to recommend for or against initiating statins for primary prevention in this age group. Evidence on potential harms specifically in adults 76 years or older is limited, while trials in the general adult population show statins are not associated with an increased risk of myalgia, elevated alanine aminotransferase level, or cognitive harms.

### Statins for prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: evidence report and systematic review for the US preventive services task force [^5f11b3d0]. JAMA (2016). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Cardiovascular disease (CVD), the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the United States, may be potentially preventable with statin therapy.

Objective

To systematically review benefits and harms of statins for prevention of CVD to inform the US Preventive Services Task Force.

Data Sources

Ovid MEDLINE (from 1946), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (from 1991), and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (from 2005) to June 2016.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials of statins vs placebo, fixed-dose vs titrated statins, and higher- vs lower-intensity statins in adults without prior cardiovascular events.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

One investigator abstracted data, a second checked data for accuracy, and 2 investigators independently assessed study quality using predefined criteria. Data were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis.

Main Outcomes and Measures

All-cause mortality, CVD-related morbidity or mortality, and harms.

Results

Nineteen trials (n = 71 344 participants [range, 95–17 802]; mean age, 51–66 years) compared statins vs placebo or no statin. Statin therapy was associated with decreased risk of all-cause mortality (risk ratio [RR], 0.86 [95% CI, 0.80 to 0.93]; I2 = 0%; absolute risk difference [ARD], -0.40% [95% CI, -0.64% to -0.17%]), cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.69 [95% CI, 0.54 to 0.88]; I2 = 54%; ARD, -0.43% [95% CI, -0.75% to -0.11%]), stroke (RR, 0.71 [95% CI, 0.62 to 0.82]; I2 = 0; ARD, -0.38% [95% CI, -0.53% to -0.23%]), myocardial infarction (RR, 0.64 [95% CI, 0.57 to 0.71]; I2 = 0%; ARD, -0.81% [95% CI, -1.19 to -0.43%]), and composite cardiovascular outcomes (RR, 0.70 [95% CI, 0.63 to 0.78]; I2 = 36%; ARD, -1.39% [95% CI, -1.79 to -0.99%]). Relative benefits appeared consistent in demographic and clinical subgroups, including populations without marked hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol level < 200 mg/dL); absolute benefits were higher in subgroups at higher baseline risk. Statins were not associated with increased risk of serious adverse events (RR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.94 to 1.04]), myalgias (RR, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.79 to 1.16]), or liver-related harms (RR, 1.10 [95% CI, 0.90 to 1.35]). In pooled analysis, statins were not associated with increased risk of diabetes (RR, 1.05 [95% CI, 0.91 to 1.20]), although statistical heterogeneity was present (I2 = 52%), and 1 trial found high-intensity statins associated with increased risk (RR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.05 to 1.49]). No trial directly compared titrated vs fixed-dose statins, and there were no clear differences based on statin intensity.

Conclusions and Relevance

In adults at increased CVD risk but without prior CVD events, statin therapy was associated with reduced risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality and CVD events, with greater absolute benefits in patients at greater baseline risk.

### Meta-analysis of usefulness of treatment of hypercholesterolemia with statins for primary prevention in patients older than 75 years [^3343485a]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical guidelines from the United States and Europe do not recommend treatment with statins for primary prevention in patients with hypercholesterolemia who are older than 75 years. Data from 35 randomized controlled trials in this age group where statin therapy for primary prevention was compared with placebo or usual care were analyzed. Using all-cause death as the outcome, we performed 2 types of analyses: frequentist and Bayesian. Frequentist analysis indicated no significant difference in mortality between cases (on statins) and controls (on placebo or usual care, p = 0.16). However, in the Bayesian analysis, patients > 75 years had lower mortality from treatment with statins (p = 0.03). In conclusion, Bayesian analysis indicates a definite, statistically significant and clinically relevant benefit of statin treatment for primary prevention in patients > 75 years of age.

### Statins, mortality, and major adverse cardiovascular events among veterans with CKD… [^b97f22be]. JAMA Network (2023). Excellent credibility.

Question Among adults older than 65 years with chronic kidney disease stages 3 to 4 and no history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, is new statin use associated with lower risk of mortality or major adverse cardiovascular events. Findings In this cohort study of 14 828 participants, a target trial emulation of statin initiation found that statins were significantly associated with a 9% lower risk of all-cause mortality. There was a numerically lower risk of MACE, but the results were not statistically significant. Meaning These findings suggest that in older adults with CKD stages 3 to 4 without prior ASCVD, statin initiation may lower risk of mortality and MACE. Importance There are limited data for the utility of statins for primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and death in adults with chronic kidney disease.

The lack of evidence for statins for primary prevention in older adults has contributed to a growing call to deprescribe or avoid using these medications, 6, 10 yet it is particularly the older adult population with CKD that is at the highest risk of mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events. 11 Therefore, we used a target trial emulation framework to examine the association of statin initiation with mortality and MACE among older adults following moderate CKD diagnosis using data from the US Veterans Health Administration. In this target trial emulation of statin initiation in US veterans older than 65 years with CKD stages 3 to 4 and no prior ASCVD, statin initiation was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality but not with MACE. In a less restrictive analysis that included all eligible veterans, results suggested a greater protective association for statins with both all-cause mortality and MACE.

These results call into question the growing movement to deprescribe statins for primary prevention in older adults with CKD. 10, 28. Among US veterans older than 65 years with CKD stages 3 to 4 and no prior ASCVD, statin initiation was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality compared with no statin initiation. Results should be confirmed in a randomized clinical trial. However, until such trials are completed, these data argue against withholding or deprescribing statins for primary prevention in older patients with CKD stages 3 to 4.

### Serum total cholesterol and risk of cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality in old age: a population-based study [^20ef86cc]. BMC Geriatrics (2017). Low credibility.

The tolerability of cholesterol-lowering agents in the elderly people (e.g. age ≥ 75 years) has become a concern, because the potential harm of intensive treatment of high cholesterol might be greater in older adults than that in young and middle-aged people. The current guidelines do recommend that the treatment and control of blood cholesterol among elderly people should be with additional cautions. For instance, the 2011 guidelines from the European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society recommended that clinician judgement is urged for the treatment of high blood cholesterol in elderly people. The 2013 guidelines from the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association recommended a lower intensity of statin therapy for the elderly people than for young and middle aged people to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

The present study has many strengths, e.g. population-based study design, long follow-up, and appropriate statistical analysis (i.e. competing risks models). However, this study also has limitations. First, we only focused on total cholesterol measured and we were not able to examine the associations between various components of lipid profiles (e.g. low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride) and mortality due to lack of data in our project. Second, cardiovascular risk reduction might at least partly rely on types, dosages, period and adherence of cholesterol-lowering therapy, but we could not address these issues because of lack of the relevant information. Third, other potential residual confounding (e.g. nutritional status), which are related to both total cholesterol and mortality, cannot be completely ruled out. Finally, we only controlled for potential confounders measured at baseline without taking into account the changes of these factors during follow-up, which might also affect mortality.

### Association of statin use with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in US veterans 75 and older… [^ca58f7dc]. JAMA Network (2020). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this retrospective cohort study that used propensity score overlap weighting and included 326 981 participants, statin use, compared with no statin use, was significantly associated with a lower risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. This is one reason the updated 2018 cholesterol guidelines recommend statins as a reasonable choice for primary prevention of ASCVD for individuals 75 years and older without a life-limiting disease.
6. After propensity score overlap weighting was applied, statin use was significantly associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular death. In sensitivity analysis, HRs plotted at 2-year intervals following the index date indicated that statin use was significantly associated with lower mortality within the first three 2-year intervals.

For all-cause mortality, HRs at years 2, 4, and 6 were 0. 68,
0. 79, and 0. 87, with a similar pattern for cardiovascular death. In subgroup analysis, the association between statin use and lower mortality remained statistically significant across all age groups, with significant lower risk of both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality even in those 90 years and older. Quiz Ref IDIn a cohort of veterans 75 years and older, new statin use was significantly associated with a lower risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Results remained consistent even at advanced ages and in those with comorbidities, with similar lower risk for mortality observed in statin users 90 years and older or with dementia.

In secondary analyses, new statin use was also significantly associated with a lower risk of a composite of ASCVD events.

### Discontinuation versus continuation of statins: a systematic review [^0cb7c6cd]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Clinicians and patients often face a decision to continue or discontinue statins. We examined the impact of discontinuation of statins compared with continuation on clinical outcomes (all-cause mortality, cardiovascular [CV] mortality, CV events, and quality of life).

Methods

We conducted a systematic review. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), cohort studies, case-control studies, and quasi-randomized studies among people ≥ 18years were eligible. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Registry (inception to August 2023). Two independent reviewers performed screening and extracted data. Quality assessment was performed by one author and verified by another. We summarized results narratively, performed meta-analysis for a subset of studies, and used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence. We summarized findings in the subgroup of persons ≥ 75years.

Results

We retrieved 8369 titles/abstracts; 37 reports from 36 studies were eligible. This comprised 35 non-randomized studies (n = 1,708,684) and 1 RCT (n = 381). The 1 RCT was conducted among persons with life expectancy < 1year and showed there is probably no difference in 60-day mortality (risk difference = 3.5%, 90% CI -3.5 to 10.5) for statin discontinuation compared with continuation. Non-randomized studies varied in terms of population and setting, but consistently suggested that statin discontinuation might be associated with a relative increased risk of mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 1.92, 95% CI 1.52 to 2.44, nine studies), CV mortality (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.27 to 2.10, five reports), and CV events (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.23 to 1.39, eight reports). Findings in people ≥ 75years were consistent with main results. There was a high degree of uncertainty in findings from non-randomized studies due to methodological limitations.

Conclusions

Statin discontinuation does not appear to affect short-term mortality near end-of-life based on one RCT. Outside of this population, findings from non-randomized studies consistently suggested statin discontinuation may be associated with worse outcomes, though this is uncertain.

### Statins in primary prevention in people over 80 years [^e516493f]. The American Journal of Cardiology (2023). Medium credibility.

In the much older population (≥ 80 years), the management of cardiovascular diseases requires specific research to avoid a plain transposition of medical practice from younger populations. Whether statins are useful in primary prevention in this population is not clear. The 3 intricate issues requiring attention are (1) the impact of hypercholesterolemia on mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events in subjects > 80 years, (2) the efficacy of statins to prevent cardiovascular events at this age, and (3) the safety and tolerance of statins in this population. Three systematic reviews were performed using a search on EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science databases including publication until January 2021. Among the 7,617 references identified, 29 were finally retained. Regarding the first objective (16 studies, 121,250 participants), 7 studies (10,241 participants) did not find total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels associated with an increased rate of major cardiovascular events in octogenarians. A total of 6 studies (14,493 participants) found increased levels associated with events, whereas 3 studies (96,516 participants) found the opposite, with increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events with lower levels of cholesterol. In 8 studies (436,005 participants) addressing the efficacy of statins, most did not indicate a significant decrease in the rate of major cardiovascular events in these subjects. Finally, regarding tolerance (9 studies, 217,088 participants), the most important side effects in this population were muscular, hepatic, and gastrointestinal disorders. These events were more frequent than in the younger population. In conclusion, in the absence of convincing evidence, the benefit of statins in primary prevention for much older patients is not certain. Their prescription in this setting should only be considered case by case, taking into consideration physiological status, co-morbidities, level of risk, and expected life expectancy. Specific trials are mandatory.

### Evaluation of time to benefit of statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in adults aged 50 to 75 years: a meta-analysis [^83550547]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Importance

Guidelines recommend targeting preventive interventions toward older adults whose life expectancy is greater than the intervention's time to benefit (TTB). The TTB for statin therapy is unknown.

Objective

To conduct a survival meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials of statins to determine the TTB for prevention of a first major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) in adults aged 50 to 75 years.

Data Sources

Studies were identified from previously published systematic reviews (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and US Preventive Services Task Force) and a search of MEDLINE and Google Scholar for subsequently published studies until February 1, 2020.

Study Selection

Randomized clinical trials of statins for primary prevention focusing on older adults (mean age > 55 years).

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two authors independently abstracted survival data for the control and intervention groups. Weibull survival curves were fit, and a random-effects model was used to estimate pooled absolute risk reductions (ARRs) between control and intervention groups each year. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods were applied to determine time to ARR thresholds.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was time to ARR thresholds (0.002, 0.005, and 0.010) for a first MACE, as defined by each trial. There were broad similarities in the definition of MACE across trials, with all trials including myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality.

Results

Eight trials randomizing 65 383 adults (66.3% men) were identified. The mean age ranged from 55 to 69 years old and the mean length of follow-up ranged from 2 to 6 years. Only 1 of 8 studies showed that statins decreased all-cause mortality. The meta-analysis results suggested that 2.5 (95% CI, 1.7–3.4) years were needed to avoid 1 MACE for 100 patients treated with a statin. To prevent 1 MACE for 200 patients treated (ARR = 0.005), the TTB was 1.3 (95% CI, 1.0–1.7) years, whereas the TTB to avoid 1 MACE for 500 patients treated (ARR = 0.002) was 0.8 (95% CI, 0.5–1.0) years.

Conclusions and Relevance

These findings suggest that treating 100 adults (aged 50–75 years) without known cardiovascular disease with a statin for 2.5 years prevented 1 MACE in 1 adult. Statins may help to prevent a first MACE in adults aged 50 to 75 years old if they have a life expectancy of at least 2.5 years. There is no evidence of a mortality benefit.

### Reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol after myocardial infarction in older individuals, levels versus change: can observational studies answer the questions? [^d81b51fb]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Epidemiology studies before the introduction of statin therapy had shown that total or low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL‐C) levels at the time of heart attack were directly related to subsequent risk of recurrent myocardial infarction (MI) and death. 1 There was a strong linear relationship between the extent of the reduction of LDL‐C and decreased risk of recurrent events after initial heart attack (ie, secondary trials of statin therapy). 2 The change in LDL‐C level and lower level of LDL‐C were major determinants of the reduction in risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). It has been estimated that for both primary and secondary prevention that a 1‐mmol, ≈38‐mg, reduction in LDL‐C resulted in ≈22% decrease in CHD incidence. 2

The type of statin therapy, intense or moderate, is directly related to the amount of LDL‐C lowering but not necessarily the level reached after starting statin therapy.

A recent meta‐analysis suggested that the benefits of more intense versus less intense statin therapy may be restricted to individuals with initial LDL‐C > 100 mg/dL (ie, before starting statin therapy). 3 The initial results of clinical trials of PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9) inhibitors in combination with statin therapy versus statin therapy alone have demonstrated both a greater reduction in LDL‐C and decrease in MI but no significant decline in either cardiovascular disease (CVD) or total deaths. 4 This may be, in part, because of the short‐term follow up or possibly that the drugs have less effect on cardiovascular mortality. There is less clinical trial evidence on the efficacy of statin therapies for those aged > 75 years for both primary and secondary prevention of CHD, resulting in different guidelines proposed for statin therapy in elderly individuals. 5, 6, 7 Major concerns for use of statin therapy in elderly individuals include the following: (1) the high prevalence of comorbidities that contribute to disability and death 5; (2) potential adverse effects of statin therapy on other health behaviors, especially muscle pain leading to a decrease in physical activity and fitness among elderly individuals 8; (3) polypharmacy and risk of adverse drug interactions; (4) hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus leading to increased use of antidiabetic drug therapies 9 (this increase in diabetes mellitus may be especially important in the increasing population of older individuals who have obesity, insulin resistance, and hyperglycemia); and (5) the unproved suggestions that lowering LDL‐C in elderly individuals might be associated with cognitive decline or depression.

### Healthy ageing: addressing acute coronary syndrome? [^175873ca]. European Heart Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Acute coronary syndromes contribute significantly to the patterns of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. A meta-analysis of the pathology of acute myocardial infarction has shown that 80–90% of episodes result from the rupture of small, unstable lesions that cause < 70% diameter stenosis. Statins have been shown to stabilize the architecture of atherosclerotic plaques in humans and in animals. Statin treatment has also been shown to restore endothelial function, inhibit platelet thrombus formation and exert an anti-inflammatory effect. Collectively, these data support the use of statin therapy in those at risk for acute coronary syndromes, of whom the elderly are foremost.

### Drug insight: statin use in the elderly [^69676cf0]. Nature Clinical Practice: Cardiovascular Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

The elderly represent a notable proportion of patients who present with myocardial infarction or acute coronary syndromes. This subgroup of patients also experiences a higher incidence of adverse outcomes than younger age-groups, and, therefore, has more to gain from effective, evidence-based therapies. The efficacy of statins in secondary cardiovascular disease prevention is firmly established. The starting of therapy soon after an acute coronary event has been shown to provide added benefit. Uncertainties about the effectiveness of statins in the elderly, however, have resulted in their underuse in this population. In this review we evaluate the evidence for statin use in this important and increasingly large group of patients.

### Efficacy and safety of statin therapy in older people: a meta-analysis of individual participant data from 28 randomised controlled trials [^e595988e]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Research in context

Evidence before this study

Before this meta-analysis, the evidence available from randomised trials on the effects of statin therapy in older people had been summarised only in meta-analyses of aggregated data from published reports. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and PubMed for English-language publications published between Jan 1, 1996, and Dec 31, 2017, using the search terms "statins OR HMG CoA Reductase Inhibitors" and "Elderly OR Aged", and found 14 meta-analyses with conflicting assessments of efficacy among older people (generally defined as > 65 years). Because of a lack of access to the individual participant data, none of these previous meta-analyses were able to examine the effects of statins within particular older age groups (eg, > 75 years) in primary and secondary prevention. We previously reported meta-analyses of the effects of statins by age, but these analyses were restricted in scope and some large randomised trials that included older individuals have been reported since they were published.

Added value of this study

We analysed individual participant data from 27 randomised controlled trials (n = 174 149) and detailed summary data from one trial (n = 12 705). During 4·9 years of follow-up, major vascular events were significantly reduced by statin therapy among all age groups by about a fifth per 1·0 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction, including among the 14 483 participants who were older than 75 years at randomisation. Older age groups were disproportionately represented in heart failure and dialysis trials (which did not show an overall benefit with statin therapy), and exclusion of those trials weakened an apparent trend with increasing age towards smaller relative risk reductions in vascular event and mortality outcomes. We found significant reductions in major coronary events in all age groups (including those older than 75 years at randomisation), but the trend towards smaller relative reductions with increasing age persisted, even after excluding heart failure and dialysis trials. However, as the absolute risk of these events was higher in older people, the absolute benefits were similar to, if not greater than, those at younger ages. We observed significant efficacy regardless of age among participants with previous vascular disease, whereas there was a weak trend towards smaller relative risk reductions with increasing age in the primary prevention setting (although there were too few such older participants for reliable assessment in that group alone). Despite previous concerns, we found no adverse effects on cancer or non-vascular mortality in any age group.

### Time to benefit of statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events… [^ff393fb2]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

These findings suggest that statin medications for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events may reduce cardiac events for some adults aged 50 to 75 years with a life expectancy of at least 2. 5 years; no data suggest a mortality benefit. Importance Guidelines recommend targeting preventive interventions toward older adults whose life expectancy is greater than the intervention's time to benefit. The TTB for statin therapy is unknown. Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that treating 100 adults without known cardiovascular disease with a statin for 2. 5 years prevented 1 MACE in 1 adult. Statins may help to prevent a first MACE in adults aged 50 to 75 years old if they have a life expectancy of at least 2. 5 years. There is no evidence of a mortality benefit.

Indeed, a randomized clinical trial in older adults with a life expectancy of less than 1 year showed worse self-reported quality of life at 60 days in patients who continued long-term statin therapy vs those from whom it was withdrawn.
11. Older adults with a limited life expectancy should avoid preventive interventions with an extended TTB, because these older adults would be exposed to the up-front harms and burdens of the intervention with little chance that they survive to experience the benefit. Although many indexes to predict life expectancy for older adults have been validated and are available through websites such as ePrognosis, the TTB of statins for the primary prevention of MACEs is unclear. In this survival meta-analysis, the TTB to prevent 1 MACE for 100 adults aged 50–75 years treated with statins was 2. 5 years.

These results suggest that statins are most likely to benefit adults aged 50–75 years with a life expectancy of greater than 2. 5 years and less likely to benefit those with a life expectancy of less than
2. 5 years. Quiz Ref IDIn this meta-analysis, only 1 of 8 randomized trials found that statins decreased all-cause mortality when used for primary prevention. We found that 100 adults aged 50 to 75 years would need to be treated for 2. 5 years to avoid 1 MACE. This result suggests that statin treatment is most appropriate for adults aged 50–75 years with a life expectancy of greater than 2. 5 years.

### Life's essential 8: optimizing health in older adults [^5a864e85]. JACC: Advances (2023). Medium credibility.

Recommendations for controlling cholesterol in older adults

Most recently, 2018 American College of Cardiology/AHA guideline recommended statin use for primary prevention in patients with LDL-C ≥ 190 mg/dL, DM, or a 10-year atherosclerotic CVD risk ≥ 7.5% with risk enhancers. Atherosclerotic CVD risk is validated for age 20 to 79 years. On the other hand, cardiovascular risk score-3 risk calculator is valid up to the age of 85 years.

Coronary artery calcium score is a valuable prognostic tool in older adults. The negative predictive value of zero coronary artery calcium score for predicting CAD events and mortality increases with age and can be used as an impactful prognostic marker for de-risking at older ages.

Adherence to a healthy lifestyle aids in cholesterol lowering. Statins are important for secondary prevention, and to reduce first CVD event at least to age 75 years. Observational data suggest lower risk for CV events for primary prevention over age 75 years with statin. Few trials have included individuals aged 75 and older. The PROSPER (Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk) trial, the first dedicated trial to older individuals (70–82 years), demonstrated an overall improvement in CVD outcomes with pravastatin treatment in a mixed primary and secondary prevention population. Subsequent analysis of primary prevention data from Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin and Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation-3 demonstrated a significant 26% relative reduction in CVD events and death among individuals aged ≥ 70 years. Moreover, meta-analysis of 28 major statin trials that included over 186,000 participants (both primary and secondary prevention) and found a 12% reduction in vascular mortality per 1.0 mmol/L reduction in LDL-C, though benefits were attenuated in those over age 75 without pre-existing CVD. Two ongoing randomized controlled trials, the STAREE (Statin Therapy for Reducing Events in the Elderly;) trial and the PREVENTABLE (Pragmatic Evaluation of Events and Benefits of Lipid-Lowering in Older Adults;) trial will address the role of statins for primary prevention in those aged 75 years and older. In addition to lowering cholesterol, statins may have antiaging properties through modulation of telomerase activity. That being said, in older adults with life-limiting illnesses and polypharmacy concerns, the potential net benefits of statin treatment for primary prevention are likely attenuated.

### Statin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in adults: US preventive services task force recommendation statement [^96bc0293]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Older adults (≥ 75 years) — Evidence on benefits is limited; PROSPER (n = 3239 for primary prevention) found no decrease in all-cause mortality (RR, 1.07 [95% CI, 0.86 to 1.35]), risk of stroke (RR, 1.03 [95% CI, 0.73 to 1.45]), or a composite cardiovascular outcome (RR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.78 to 1.14]); in ALLHAT-LLT, statin therapy was associated with higher risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in persons 75 years or older than in those aged 65 to 74 years (hazard ratio, 1.36 [95% CI, 0.98 to 1.89] vs 1.05 [95% CI, 0.81 to 1.35]; RR, 1.39 [95% CI, 0.85 to 2.25] vs 0.99 [95% CI, 0.71 to 1.39]), although estimates for the age group 75 years or older were imprecise and not statistically significant; ALLHAT-LLT had important limitations and showed no benefit of statin use overall.

### Statin therapy is associated with reduced mortality across all age groups of individuals with significant coronary disease, including very elderly patients [^08b4e018]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2002). Low credibility.

Objectives

This study evaluated the effect of statin therapy on mortality in individuals with significant coronary artery disease (CAD) stratified by age.

Background

Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) significantly reduce morbidity and mortality in individuals with CAD. Unfortunately, the large statin trials excluded individuals over 80 years old, and it is therefore unknown whether very elderly individuals benefit from statins as do younger individuals.

Methods

A cohort of 7,220 individuals with angiographically defined significant CAD (≥ 70%) was included. Statin prescription was determined at hospital discharge. Patients were followed up for 3.3 ± 1.8 years (maximum 6.8). Patients were grouped by age (< 65, 65 to 79, and ≥ 80 years) to determine whether statin therapy reduced mortality in an age-dependent manner.

Results

Average age was 65 ± 12 years; 74% were male; and 31% had a postmyocardial infarction status. Overall mortality was 16%. Elderly patients were significantly less likely to receive statins than younger patients (≥ 80 years: 19.8%; 65 to 79 years: 21.1%; < 65 years: 28.0%; p < 0.001). Mortality was decreased among statin recipients in all age groups: ≥ 80 years: 29.5% among patients not taking a statin versus 8.5% of those taking a statin (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.50, p = 0.036); 65 to 79 years: 18.7% vs. 6.0% (HR 0.56, p < 0.001); and < 65 years: 8.9% vs. 3.1% (HR 0.70, p = 0.097).

Conclusions

Statin therapy is associated with reduced mortality in all age groups of individuals with significant CAD, including very elderly individuals. Although older patients were less likely to receive statin therapy, they received a greater absolute risk reduction than younger individuals. More aggressive statin use after CAD diagnosis may be indicated, even in older patients.

### Prevention and treatment of coronary heart disease: who benefits? [^d36fe02d]. Circulation (2001). Low credibility.

Coronary heart disease (CHD) remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, despite our better understanding of the pathobiology of atherosclerosis, our knowledge of risk factors, the widespread availability of inexpensive cholesterol screening, and the availability of effective and well-tolerated cholesterol-lowering agents. Advances in these areas have created controversies regarding who should be screened and treated for primary or secondary prevention of coronary events. The advent of the statin class of lipid-lowering agents represented a major advance, because they are much more effective and better tolerated than previous agents. There is general agreement that patients with hypercholesterolemia and established CHD require treatment for secondary prevention of recurrent coronary events. Primary prevention is controversial in all patient groups except those with diabetes, because their risk of developing CHD is dramatically increased. Postmenopausal women and the elderly are undertreated, whereas young adults may be underdiagnosed and undertreated. Several ongoing trials may resolve the controversies about which patient groups will benefit from different prevention and treatment strategies.

### Statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^853a9ff4]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Reducing high blood cholesterol, a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) events in people with and without a past history of CVD is an important goal of pharmacotherapy. Statins are the first-choice agents. Previous reviews of the effects of statins have highlighted their benefits in people with CVD. The case for primary prevention was uncertain when the last version of this review was published (2011) and in light of new data an update of this review is required.

Objectives

To assess the effects, both harms and benefits, of statins in people with no history of CVD.

Search Methods

To avoid duplication of effort, we checked reference lists of previous systematic reviews. The searches conducted in 2007 were updated in January 2012. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2022, Issue 4), MEDLINE OVID (1950 to December Week 4 2011) and EMBASE OVID (1980 to 2012 Week 1). There were no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials of statins versus placebo or usual care control with minimum treatment duration of one year and follow-up of six months, in adults with no restrictions on total, low density lipoprotein (LDL) or high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and where 10% or less had a history of CVD.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion and extracted data. Outcomes included all-cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events, combined endpoints (fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events), revascularisation, change in total and LDL cholesterol concentrations, adverse events, quality of life and costs. Odds ratios (OR) and risk ratios (RR) were calculated for dichotomous data, and for continuous data, pooled mean differences (MD) (with 95% confidence intervals (CI)) were calculated. We contacted trial authors to obtain missing data.

Main Results

The latest search found four new trials and updated follow-up data on three trials included in the original review. Eighteen randomised control trials (19 trial arms; 56,934 participants) were included. Fourteen trials recruited patients with specific conditions (raised lipids, diabetes, hypertension, microalbuminuria). All-cause mortality was reduced by statins (OR 0.86, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.94); as was combined fatal and non-fatal CVD RR 0.75 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.81), combined fatal and non-fatal CHD events RR 0.73 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.80) and combined fatal and non-fatal stroke (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89). Reduction of revascularisation rates (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.72) was also seen. Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were reduced in all trials but there was evidence of heterogeneity of effects. There was no evidence of any serious harm caused by statin prescription. Evidence available to date showed that primary prevention with statins is likely to be cost-effective and may improve patient quality of life. Recent findings from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists study using individual patient data meta-analysis indicate that these benefits are similar in people at lower (< 1% per year) risk of a major cardiovascular event.

Authors' Conclusions

Reductions in all-cause mortality, major vascular events and revascularisations were found with no excess of adverse events among people without evidence of CVD treated with statins.

### Primary prevention of coronary heart disease in the elderly [^1dff3fbb]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review relevant literature supporting the use of antihypertensive agents, lipid-lowering agents (i.e., statins), and aspirin therapy for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) in an elderly patient population (age ≥ 65 y).

Data Sources

A MEDLINE search (1988-January 2003) was conducted.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Primary and tertiary literature involving the uses of antihypertensives, statins, and aspirin therapy in the elderly were reviewed.

Data Synthesis

Mortality due to CHD in the US population has decreased 40–50% over the last 30 years; however, CHD remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in elderly persons. As the population continues to age, the number of older adults eligible for primary prevention will rise. The American Heart Association clinical practice guidelines for the primary prevention of CHD were updated in 2002; however, they are based on findings from clinical trials that enrolled predominantly middle-aged white men. The recommendations for elderly individuals are predominantly extrapolated from subgroup analyses of randomized clinical trials or cohort studies. This literature suggests that elderly persons are candidates for primary prevention measures and experience reductions in coronary events when treated with appropriate therapies.

Conclusions

Data suggest that use of antihypertensives, statins, and aspirin therapy in the elderly appears effective to an extent similar to, and often greater than, that observed in younger patients. We believe these agents should be prescribed to all appropriate high-risk elderly patients. Ongoing and future studies will more clearly elucidate the benefits of primary prevention therapy, particularly in persons ≥ 75 years of age.

### Primary prevention statins in older adults: personalized care for a heterogeneous population [^b8a322c9]. Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2020). Medium credibility.

The 2018 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines on the management of cholesterol acknowledge a lack of robust randomized clinical trial data to support routine use of statin therapy for primary prevention in adults older than 75years. Shared decision making is emphasized because potential recommendations should reflect limitations of the current data, as well as heterogeneity of the older adult population, spanning the robust to the most frail. Although the National Institute on Aging recently funded PRagmatic EValuation of EvENTs And Benefits of Lipid-Lowering in OldEr Adults (PREVENTABLE), a trial to study benefits of statins in very old adults, data are not anticipated for 5years. Thus interim guidance is essential. Furthermore, even when PREVENTABLE is completed, individual idiosyncrasies among older adults suggest that decisions for each patient will still need to be personalized, relative to their unique clinical situation. In this article, we present three case studies to highlight dynamics that commonly impact choices regarding statins in older adults. Details underlying shared decision making are also described including the evolving application of coronary artery calcium to inform this practice. J Am Geriatr Soc 68:467–473, 2020.

### Evaluating the association between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction and relative and absolute effects of statin treatment: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^54c24637]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Importance

The association between statin-induced reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and the absolute risk reduction of individual, rather than composite, outcomes, such as all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, or stroke, is unclear.

Objective

To assess the association between absolute reductions in LDL-C levels with treatment with statin therapy and all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke to facilitate shared decision-making between clinicians and patients and inform clinical guidelines and policy.

Data Sources

PubMed and Embase were searched to identify eligible trials from January 1987 to June 2021.

Study Selection

Large randomized clinical trials that examined the effectiveness of statins in reducing total mortality and cardiovascular outcomes with a planned duration of 2 or more years and that reported absolute changes in LDL-C levels. Interventions were treatment with statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) vs placebo or usual care. Participants were men and women older than 18 years.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Three independent reviewers extracted data and/or assessed the methodological quality and certainty of the evidence using the risk of bias 2 tool and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation. Any differences in opinion were resolved by consensus. Meta-analyses and a meta-regression were undertaken.

Main Outcomes and Measures

Primary outcome: all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes: myocardial infarction, stroke.

Findings

Twenty-one trials were included in the analysis. Meta-analyses showed reductions in the absolute risk of 0.8% (95% CI, 0.4%-1.2%) for all-cause mortality, 1.3% (95% CI, 0.9%-1.7%) for myocardial infarction, and 0.4% (95% CI, 0.2%-0.6%) for stroke in those randomized to treatment with statins, with associated relative risk reductions of 9% (95% CI, 5%-14%), 29% (95% CI, 22%-34%), and 14% (95% CI, 5%-22%) respectively. A meta-regression exploring the potential mediating association of the magnitude of statin-induced LDL-C reduction with outcomes was inconclusive.

Conclusions and Relevance

The results of this meta-analysis suggest that the absolute risk reductions of treatment with statins in terms of all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke are modest compared with the relative risk reductions, and the presence of significant heterogeneity reduces the certainty of the evidence. A conclusive association between absolute reductions in LDL-C levels and individual clinical outcomes was not established, and these findings underscore the importance of discussing absolute risk reductions when making informed clinical decisions with individual patients.

### Lipid management in the geriatric patient [^fa6dac88]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2009). Low credibility.

Elderly individuals are at higher risk for cardiovascular events, and thus this population stands to gain a greater reduction in events from lipid therapy than younger individuals. Multiple primary and secondary prevention trials have demonstrated that the benefits of statins in geriatric patients are equivalent to, or greater than, those seen in younger patients. Combination therapy with non-statin agents should be considered in patients who do not meet cholesterol goals or who have concomitant hypertriglyceridemia or low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Although increased side effects may occur with high-dose statin therapy, careful vigilance of drug interactions and limiting polypharmacy can reduce these effects.

Older people are heterogenous in many aspects (i.e. clinically, demographically, and functionally). They were underrepresented in the available RCTs especially those aged ≥ 75 years, and this may limit the generalizability of their findings to the clinical practice. On the other hand, our study was based on data from observational studies, which are more generalizable. Another limitation of the evidence from older people RCTs is the relatively short follow-up durations that ranged from 1 to 5.2 years. However, the follow-up durations of the included cohort studies in the current meta-analysis were longer (ranged from 4.7 to 24 years). Larger included number of participants, longer durations of follow-up, residual confounders, and inclusion of prevalent statin users instead of statin new users in some of the included observational studies are possible explanations for the observed differences between our study and RCTs in case of some outcomes (as presented above). Some previous meta-analyses of RCTs reported statins effect on composite outcomes of several components that significantly varies in their clinical importance (e.g. coronary revascularization versus CVD death). It is recommended to avoid combining composite outcomes in meta-analyses to avoid any misleading results. In our study, we only combined data of single components, and we filled some gaps in the evidence about people aged ≥ 75 years, while awaiting the results of The STAREE (STAtins for Reducing Events in the Elderly) trial (NCT02099123) and the PREVENTABLE (Pragmatic Evaluation of Events and Benefits of Lipid-Lowering in Older Adults) trial (NCT04262206).

### Distribution of lifespan gain from primary prevention intervention [^5df6a24a]. Open Heart (2016). Low credibility.

Study limitations

Our calculation of lifespan gain is based on the relative risk reduction for cardiovascular mortality from preventative medication being approximately the same across risk groups and across ages. In particular, we have relied on the observation from large-scale meta-analysesof statins that there is no sign that patients with low-to-intermediate estimated cardiovascular risk have a weaker hazard reduction. However, if there is any particular risk stratum in which cardiovascular mortality is reduced to a different extent by medical intervention, then our results would need to be modified.

Our analysis pays no regard to the possibility of adverse effects of therapy. For primary prevention statins, for example, there is a documented increase of diagnosis of diabetes of approximately 0.5% which partly counteracts the 0.5% decrease in absolute mortality, 1% decrease in myocardial infarction and 0.3% decrease in strokes. In the longer term, it is conceivable that the higher rate of diabetes could increase cardiovascular event rates. However, even the longest randomised controlled trials have shown nothing other than continued reduction of cardiovascular event rates in the statin arms, to the end of the randomised period and beyond.

We used contemporary mortality data for all age strata to construct the life-table, but it should be remembered that there has been a secular trend to falling mortality, which is likely to continue for many years to come. Therefore, when people currently aged 50 eventually reach the age of 80, they will be facing not the mortality of current 80-year-olds (used in our life-tables) but a future mortality which is likely to be lower. Thus, the actual life-years gained for people starting preventative therapy now will likely be larger than computed in our life-tables.

Life expectancy and cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality rates vary between countries. Therefore, our life-tables, built from the UK data, may be slightly different in other geographies. We have previously provided full details of this method in an onlineto a previous publication.

### Efficacy and safety of statin therapy in older people: a meta-analysis of individual participant data from 28 randomised controlled trials [^e6bbb689]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

The selection criteria used among the 28 trials contributing to this meta-analysis, and differences in when they were conducted, mean that the absolute risk of major vascular events and mortality in our overall study population is not likely to be representative of any contemporary population. Therefore, we have not produced estimates of the absolute effects of statin therapy directly from the numbers of events observed in these trials. By contrast, the proportional effects observed in this meta-analysis are likely to be widely generalisable. Consequently, as the proportional reductions in major vascular events appeared to diminish only slightly (if at all) with increasing age, while untreated absolute risks of major vascular events in the general population increase exponentially with age, the absolute benefits of a given absolute reduction in LDL cholesterol with statin therapy would be expected to be substantially greater among older individuals. For example, in the primary prevention setting, two individuals aged 63 years and 78 years with otherwise identical risk factors might have projected major vascular event rates of 2·5% versus 4·0% per year, respectively. Reducing those risks by a fifth with a 1·0 mmol/L LDL cholesterol reduction would prevent first major vascular events from occurring each year in 50 individuals aged 63 years and 80 individuals aged 78 years per 10 000 people treated.

In conclusion, statin therapy produces significant reductions in major vascular events, irrespective of age. There is less definitive direct evidence of benefit in the primary prevention setting among patients older than 75 years, but evidence supports the use of statin therapy in older people considered to have a sufficiently high risk of occlusive vascular events.

### The effects of cholesterol lowering with simvastatin on cause-specific mortality and on cancer incidence in 20, 536 high-risk people: a randomised placebo-controlled trial [^3d491fa2]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Background

There have been concerns that low blood cholesterol concentrations may cause non-vascular mortality and morbidity. Randomisation of large numbers of people to receive a large, and prolonged, reduction in cholesterol concentrations provides an opportunity to address such concerns reliably.

Methods

20,536 UK adults (aged 40–80 years) with vascular disease or diabetes were randomly allocated to receive 40 mg simvastatin daily or matching placebo. Prespecified safety analyses were of cause-specific mortality, and of total and site-specific cancer incidence. Comparisons between all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants (ie, "intention-to-treat") involved an average difference in blood total cholesterol concentration of 1.2 mmol/L (46 mg/dL) during the scheduled 5-year treatment period.

Results

There was a highly significant 17% (95% CI 9–25) proportional reduction in vascular deaths, along with a non-significant reduction in all non-vascular deaths, which translated into a significant reduction in all-cause mortality (p = 0.0003). The proportional reduction in the vascular mortality rate was about one-sixth in each subcategory of participant studied, including: men and women; under and over 70 years at entry; and total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L or LDL cholesterol below 3.0 mmol/L. No significant excess of non-vascular mortality was observed in any subcategory of participant (including the elderly and those with pretreatment total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L), and there was no significant excess in any particular cause of non-vascular mortality.

Cancer incidence rates were similar in the two groups, both overall and in particular subcategories of participant, as well as at particular primary sites. There was no suggestion that any adverse trends in non-vascular mortality or morbidity were beginning to emerge with more prolonged treatment.

Conclusion

These findings, which are based on large numbers of deaths and non-fatal cancers, provide considerable reassurance that lowering total cholesterol concentrations by more than 1 mmol/L for an average of 5 years does not produce adverse effects on non-vascular mortality or cancer incidence. Moreover, among the many different types of high-risk individual studied, simvastatin 40 mg daily consistently produced substantial reductions in vascular (and, hence, all-cause) mortality, as well as in the rates of non-fatal heart attacks, strokes and revascularisation procedures.

### Reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol after myocardial infarction in older individuals, levels versus change: can observational studies answer the questions? [^603a4be9]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

In conclusion, clinical trials consistently demonstrate that the change in LDL‐C levels is associated with a substantial reduction in the risk of CHD. Second, older chronological age is not the same as older biological age. The decision about the intensity of the statin therapy (ie, moderate versus intense or even potential use of PCSK9 inhibitors) should probably be based on measures of biological aging and comorbidity (ie, degree of disability, frailty, cognitive dysfunction, and sarcopenia) rather than just a specific chronological age. Third, a low cholesterol level in an older individual may be attributable to poor health rather than good health and may be associated with increased mortality, a paradox similar to that observed with lower blood pressure levels in elderly individuals. Such information should not be used to presume that low cholesterol levels over a lifetime among elderly individuals are associated with increased mortality and, therefore, that statin therapy should not be used in elderly individuals. Fourth, a primary determinant of CVD in both middle‐aged and older individuals is the extent of atherosclerosis, which can be easily measured by computed tomography with low radiation effects and at relatively low cost. 19 If there is question about whether to start or not start statin therapy or intensive or moderate‐intense statin therapy in elderly individuals, measurement of coronary atherosclerosis may be an approach to evaluate the likelihood of recurrent cardiac events and benefits of statin therapy. Finally, lack of adherence to statin therapy is a major player in the continued high morbidity and mortality of CVD after a heart attack. A focus on enhancing adherence to statin drug therapy is probably more important in the community than a continued debate on whether the LDL‐C level should be reduced to 70 or 50 mg%. 20

### Cardiovascular effect of discontinuing statins for primary prevention at the age of 75 years: a nationwide population-based cohort study in France [^342cb78f]. European Heart Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular events after discontinuation of statin therapy

Some studies have tried to specifically address the value of statins in the elderly population. The PROSPER (Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk) trialevaluated the effect of pravastatin 40 mg on the risk of cardiovascular events in people aged 70–82 years (mean age 75 years). In the primary prevention subgroup of 3239 patients, statin therapy did not significantly reduce the incidence of coronary heart disease and stroke vs. placebo.

Based on data from the JUPITER (Justification for Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) trial, comparing Rosuvastatin 20 mg vs. placebo in patients with no history of cardiovascular disease and high C-reactive protein and low low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, subgroup analysis in the 5695 participants aged 70 years or older (median age 74 years) showed a significant reduction of cardiovascular events (HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.46–0.82), but not all-cause mortality (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.62–1.04).

The meta-analysis of primary prevention by Savarese et al.based on eight trials including 24 674 people over the age of 65 years with a mean age of 73 years concluded that statins vs. placebo significantly reduced the risk of myocardial infarction by 39.4% (95% CI 15.3–56.6%) and the risk of stroke by 23.8% (95% CI 7.4–37.4%), but statins did not provide any significant benefit on the risk of cardiovascular or all-cause mortality.

The recent meta-analysis by the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration, based on 28 trials, included a subgroup of 6449 primary prevention patients older than 75 years. Within this subgroup, cardiovascular incidence rates of 2.7 and 2.8 per 100 patient-years were found for the patient groups 'statin or more intensive treatment' and 'controls or less intensive treatment', respectively, corresponding to a rate ratio per 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol of 0.92 (95% CI 0.73–1.16).

### Evidence-based use of statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease [^513386b5]. The American Journal of Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Three-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, are widely available, inexpensive, and represent a potent therapy for treating elevated cholesterol. Current national guidelines put forth by the Adult Treatment Panel III recommend statins as part of a comprehensive primary prevention strategy for patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol at increased risk for developing coronary heart disease within 10 years. Lack of a clear-cut mortality benefit in primary prevention has caused some to question the use of statins for patients without known coronary heart disease. On review of the literature, we conclude that current data support only a modest mortality benefit for statin primary prevention when assessed in the short term (< 5 years). Of note, statin primary prevention results in a significant decrease in cardiovascular morbidity over the short and long term and a trend toward increased reduction in mortality over the long term. When appraised together, these data provide compelling evidence to support the use of statins for primary prevention in patients with risk factors for developing coronary heart disease over the next 10 years.

### Association of statin use in older people primary prevention group with risk of cardiovascular events and mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies [^66c8cf23]. BMC Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Data extraction and outcomes of interest

Using preformatted tables, two independent authors (MM, MZ) reviewed the included articles and extracted the following data: (1) first author's name, (2) year of publication, (3) study location, (4) study design, (5) follow-up duration, (6) study population characteristics, and (7) data regarding the relevant outcomes (i.e. the most adjusted risk estimates along with their 95% CI). Disagreements were resolved upon the opinion of another author (KA).

Primary outcomes were risk estimates of all cause-mortality, CVD death, MI, and stroke. Secondary outcomes included risk estimates on NODM and cancer incidence.

If a study reported its data on the older people as multiple age cohorts, in which participants of the first age cohort who survived to the next target age could have been a part of multiple age cohorts, we only extracted data of the age cohort with the largest sample size to avoid overlapped data.

Risk of bias assessment

Two reviewers (KA and MZ) independently used The Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool for the risk of bias assessment of the included studies. This tool includes seven domains and rates the overall risk of bias as low, moderate, serious, critical, or unclear. Disagreements were resolved by discussion.

Quality of evidence assessment

The level of evidence of each primary outcome was rated as very low, low, moderate, or high quality using the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. This rating system is based on five domains to downgrade the evidence level as follows: risk of bias, imprecision, inconsistency, indirectness, and publication bias; and other three domains for upgrading the evidence level as follows: large effect size, dose-response gradient, and all residual confounding reducing an effect size.

### The effects of cholesterol lowering with simvastatin on cause-specific mortality and on cancer incidence in 20, 536 high-risk people: a randomised placebo-controlled trial [^68424f78]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Discussion

The large size of the Heart Protection Study, its prospective randomised design and the inclusion of a broad range of participants allow it to assess reliably both the efficacy and the safety of cholesterol lowering in a variety of different circumstances. The present results demonstrate that lowering LDL cholesterol by about 1 mmol/L (38 mg/dL) for 5 years with a statin reduces the rate of death from vascular causes by about one-sixth, with no apparent adverse effect on non-vascular mortality or morbidity. This proportional reduction in vascular mortality was remarkably consistent among the different types of participant studied, including women as well as men, older as well as younger individuals, and those who entered the study with below average cholesterol concentrations. Furthermore, the lack of any significant hazard was also consistent among the different types of participant, and there was no suggestion of any adverse effects emerging with more prolonged follow-up.

Consistent beneficial effects of cholesterol lowering on vascular mortality and morbidity

The prespecified analyses for assessing the benefits of statin allocation in different types of participant were to be of major vascular and coronary events. Because much larger numbers suffered at least one such event, analyses of those outcomes can help interpret the observed effects on the smaller numbers of deaths from vascular causes. For example, the proportional reduction in vascular mortality observed among the 5082 participating women was very similar to that among the men. But since fewer women took part and their absolute risk of vascular death was somewhat lower, this result did not reach conventional levels of statistical significance on its own (p = 0.08). Even so, the very definite and highly significant reductions in major vascular events observed among the participating women (figure 6) indicate that the reduction in vascular death, and hence in all-cause mortality, among the women is real. Similarly, the highly significant reductions in major vascular events in the elderly and those with below average cholesterol concentrations at baseline reinforce the consistent reductions in vascular mortality of about one-sixth in these groups. Given the two-thirds compliance during HPS, actual use of 40 mg simvastatin daily in this population would lower LDL cholesterol by about 1.5 mmol/L (57 mg/dL), and this would probably reduce the vascular death rate by about one quarter. Furthermore, the continued divergence in the vascular death rate during successive years of follow-up (reinforced by the similar effect on major vascular events) suggests that more prolonged statin therapy would produce even larger absolute reductions in vascular mortality.

### Real-life benefits of statins for cardiovascular prevention in elderly subjects: a population-based cohort study [^c262435e]. The American Journal of Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The benefits of initiating statins in the elderly remains debated. We evaluated the effects of initiating statins in the elderly, according to cardiovascular risk.

Methods

This population-based cohort study used data of the representative sample of the French health care system database for the 2008–2015 period. New users of statins, aged 75 years and older, were dynamically included in the cohort and matched 1:1 to statin nonusers on age, sex, numbers of different drugs dispensed and medical consultations, and cardiovascular history. Patients were classified into 3 cardiovascular risk groups: secondary prevention (history of coronary heart disease), primary prevention with modifiable risk factors (diabetes or cardiovascular medications), and primary prevention without modifiable risk factors (none of the above). Effect of cumulative use of statins on occurrence of acute coronary syndrome or all-cause death was analyzed by using multivariable time-dependent Cox models stratified on cardiovascular risk at inclusion.

Results

Among the 7284 patients included, median follow-up was 4.7 years. Cumulative use of statins was associated with a lower risk of outcomes in the primary prevention with modifiable risk factors group (adjusted hazard ratio 0.93 per year of use; 95% confidence interval, 0.89–0.96; P < .01) and in the secondary prevention group (0.75; 0.63–0.90; P < .01), but not in the primary prevention without modifiable risk factors group (1.01; 0.86–1.18; P = 0.92).

Conclusions

Statin treatment was not associated with a reduction in acute coronary syndrome or all-cause death in elderly without modifiable cardiovascular risk factor treated in primary prevention.

### Efficacy and safety of statin therapy in older people: a meta-analysis of individual participant data from 28 randomised controlled trials [^11df93a5]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Individual randomised trials of statin therapy have previously reported significant cardiovascular risk reductions among participants older than 65 years but younger than 70 years at the time of randomisation (who were therefore aged > 70–75 years at the end of a median of 5 years of scheduled treatment). Meta-analyses among older people have consistently reported evidence for beneficial effects in secondary prevention, but the evidence has been less clear for primary prevention. Availability of individual participant data in the CTT Collaboration database has permitted more detailed assessment of the effects of statin therapy at different ages.

In our meta-analysis of data from 28 trials among 186 854 people (with 14 483 [8%] older than 75 years at randomisation), we found slightly smaller proportional risk reductions in major vascular events (p trend = 0·06) and vascular deaths (p trend = 0·004) with increasing age. The exclusion criteria for 24 trials incorporated at least one of the following: a history of heart failure, poor ejection fraction, poor prognosis (other than from atherosclerotic disease), or the requirement for renal dialysis. However, two trials exclusively enrolled patients with moderate to severe (New York Heart Association Class II–IV) heart failure, and two exclusively enrolled patients with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis. Statin therapy has not been found to reduce the risk of major vascular events or vascular deaths in either of these patient populations, and consequently is not recommended for such patients in the absence of other indications. Therefore, we did exploratory analyses that excluded these four trials, to assess their contribution to the observed trends towards smaller relative reductions with increasing age. Among people without heart or renal failure, we found little evidence of any diminution of benefit with increasing age on major vascular events (p trend = 0·3) or on vascular death (p trend = 0·2).

### Statins are associated with a large reduction in all-cause mortality in women from a cardiac outpatient population [^286de23e]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Fewer women received statins than men, and when they did, they were more likely to receive low-intensity regimens. The protective effect of primary prevention statins was stronger in women than men for both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, but the additional benefit of high-intensity statins was modest and similar for both sexes. Statins seem to be effective regardless of treatment intensity, especially in women.

### Statins versus placebo for people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [^3932cb92]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common, preventable, and treatable respiratory disease. COPD exacerbations are associated with worse quality of life, increased hospitalisations, and increased mortality. Currently available pharmacological interventions have variable impact on exacerbation frequency. The anti-inflammatory effects of statins may lead to decreased pulmonary and systemic inflammation, resulting in fewer exacerbations of COPD. Several observational studies have shown potential benefits of statins for patients with COPD.

Objectives

This review aims to evaluate available evidence on benefits and harms associated with statin therapy compared with placebo as adjunct therapy for patients with COPD. Primary objectives include the following.• To determine whether statins reduce mortality rates in COPD.• To determine whether statins reduce exacerbation frequency, improve quality of life, or improve lung function in COPD.• To determine whether statins are associated with adverse effects.

Search Methods

We identified trials from the Cochrane Airways Trials Register, which contains studies identified through multiple electronic searches and handsearches of other sources. We also searched trial registries and reference lists of primary studies. We conducted the most recent search on 20 May 2019.

Selection Criteria

Parallel, randomised controlled trials recruiting adults with COPD.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methods as expected by Cochrane. Prespecified primary outcomes were number of exacerbations, all-cause mortality, and COPD-specific mortality.

Main Results

Eight studies including 1323 participants with COPD were included in the review. Participants had a mean age of 61.4 to 72 years, and most were male (median 73.4%). Mean baseline forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV₁) ranged from 41% to 90% predicted. All studies compared moderate- or high-intensity statin therapy versus placebo. The duration of treatment ranged from 12 weeks to 36 months. We found no statistically significant difference between statins and placebo in our primary outcome of number of exacerbations per person-year (mean difference (MD) -0.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.25 to 0.19, 1 trial, 877 participants), including number of exacerbations requiring hospitalisation per person-year (MD 0.00, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.10, 1 trial, 877 exacerbations). This evidence was of moderate quality after downgrading for unclear risk of bias. Our primary outcomes of all-cause mortality (odds ratio (OR) 1.03, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.74, 2 trials, 952 participants) and COPD-specific mortality (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.38 to 4.13, 1 trial, 877 participants) showed no significant difference between statins and placebo, with wide confidence intervals suggesting uncertainty about the precision of the results. This evidence was of low quality after downgrading for unclear risk of bias and imprecision. Results of the secondary outcomes analysis showed no clear differences between statins and placebo for FEV₁ (% predicted) (MD 1.18, 95% CI -2.6 to 4.97, 6 trials, 325 participants) but did show a statistically significant improvement in FEV₁/forced vital capacity (FVC) (MD 2.66, 95% CI 0.12 to 5.2; P = 0.04; 6 trials, 325 participants). A sensitivity analysis excluding two trials at high risk of bias showed no statistically significant difference in FEV₁/FVC (MD 2.05, 95% CI -0.87 to -4.97; P = 0.17; 4 trials, 255 participants). We also found no significant differences between the two groups in functional capacity measured by six-minute walk distance in metres (MD 1.79, 95% CI -52.51 to 56.09, 3 trials, 71 participants), with wide confidence intervals suggesting uncertainty about the precision of the results. Results show no clear difference in quality of life, which was reported in three trials, and a slight reduction in C-reactive protein (CRP) in the intervention group, which was statistically significant (MD -1.03, 95% CI -1.95 to -0.11; I² = 0%, P = 0.03; 3 trials, 142 participants). We noted a significant reduction in interleukin (IL)-6 in the intervention group (MD -2.11, 95% CI -2.65 to -1.56; I² = 0%, P ≤ 0.00001; 2 trials, 125 participants). All trials mentioned adverse events and indicated that statins were generally well tolerated. One study reported adverse events in detail and indicated that rates of all non-fatal adverse events (the number of serious adverse events per person-year) were similar in both groups (0.63 ± 1.56 events (intervention group) and 0.62 ± 1.48 events (control group); P > 0.20) for all comparisons, except for non-fatal serious adverse events involving the gastrointestinal tract, which were more frequent in the intervention group (in 30 patients (0.05 events per person-year) vs 17 patients (0.02 events per person-year); P = 0.02). Another trial lists the total numbers and percentages of adverse events in the intervention group (12 (26%)) and in the control group (21 (43%)) and of serious adverse events in the intervention group (4 (9%)) and in the control group (3 (6%)). The other trials stated that researchers found no significant adverse effects of statins but did not report adverse events in detail.

Authors' Conclusions

A small number of trials providing low- or moderate-quality evidence were suitable for inclusion in this review. They showed that use of statins resulted in a reduction in CRP and IL-6, but that this did not translate into clear clinical benefit for people with COPD. Further randomised controlled trials are needed to explore this topic.

### Statin use and adverse effects among adults > 75 Years of age: insights from the patient and provider assessment of lipid management (PALM) registry [^4b7477b5]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

Despite their high risk of ASCVD, the evidence for primary prevention statin therapy and high‐intensity statin therapy in secondary prevention in older adults is incomplete. 4, 5, 17, 18 Clinical trial data suggest a clinical benefit of moderate‐intensity statins in those aged ≥ 75 years when used for secondary prevention, and prior observational studies have demonstrated a significant risk reduction gleaned from statin therapy in this population. 11, 15, 16, 19 Similarly, a recent observational study suggests a significant survival advantage exists among older adults with ASCVD treated with high‐ versus moderate‐intensity statins, amplified at maximal doses of high‐intensity statins. 20 On the other hand, a recent post hoc analysis from the ALLHAT‐LLT (Antihypertensive and Lipid‐Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial) found a signal (P = 0.07) for possible increased all‐cause mortality among older adults treated with statins. 7 These findings highlight the necessity for clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of statin therapy, including high‐intensity therapy, for both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, specifically in older adults. One such example is the ongoing STAREE (Statin Therapy for Reducing Events in the Elderly) trial (NCT02099123). This trial is randomizing older adults (≥ 70 years) without prior ASCVD to high‐intensity statin therapy with atorvastatin 80 mg or placebo, and it features several relevant geriatric end points, including measures of cognitive function, disability, frailty, and quality of life.

### Statins are associated with a large reduction in all-cause mortality in women from a cardiac outpatient population [^464d56e4]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Women in our dataset more often received low-intensity statins compared with men, confirming previous work. The evidence supporting equal statin prescription strategies for both sexes is growing, but higher rates of side effects in women may be the underlying reason for maintaining this careful approach to statin prescription in women. The topic of statin-related side effects is still debated. Meta-analyses suggesting no differences in adverse events between treatment and placebo arms, but others argue that statin-related side effects, especially milder ones, are very common and an important challenge in statin treatment. There is also some evidence for sex differences in adverse events, but this is not yet conclusive. Our analyses exploring the relationship between statin intensity and long-term prognosis suggested high-intensity regimens only conferred marginal additional benefit. This raises the question whether low-intensity statins could already be sufficiently effective in women, and whether the small additional benefit of high-intensity statins is proportional to the increased risk of potential side effects. These yet unanswered questions underscore the importance of clinical trials providing sex-specific data for both the efficacy of low-intensity versus high-intensity statins and adverse events rates associated with different statin intensities. Dose-finding trials could answer the question which statin dosage best balances prognosis benefits against possible harms such as side effects.

### Effectiveness of Treat-to-target cholesterol-lowering interventions on cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality risk in the community-dwelling population: a target trial emulation [^8238868a]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Discussion

This study emulates a target trial via a 29-year community-dwelling-based longitudinal cohort of 5735 CMCS participants to assess the effectiveness of long-term treat-to-target cholesterol-lowering interventions adhering to the 2020 CSC recommendations or feasible interventions on CVD, all-cause mortality, and ASCVD. We found that adhering to risk-based treat-to-target cholesterol-lowering intervention for 29 years reduced 2.3% absolute risk of CVD, 3.0% of all-cause mortality, and 2.6% of ASCVD in the community-dwelling population, respectively, compared to no interventions, equivalent to REMT-based NNT of 115, 95, 104 to prevent one CVD, all-cause mortality, and ASCVD event. Furthermore, the higher adherence rate of risk-based treat-to-target cholesterol-lowering intervention would confer more evident benefit.

Given that no randomized controlled trials compared the preventive effects of time-evolving risk-based cholesterol-lowering interventions with no interventions, we cannot directly verify the preventive effects from the hypothetical treat-to-target intervention. However, our hypotheses derived from the current guidelines on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, synthetic evidence from statin therapy randomized trials showing a clear net benefit in people at low risk of vascular disease, cardiovascular-risk-based approaches for determining statin eligibility in primary prevention, and cumulative cholesterol profiles exposure showing an increased lifetime cardiovascular risk –. More importantly, our positive control analysis emulating a target trial of statin therapy and vascular disease yielded a constant of 22% ASCVD relative risk reduction per 1 mmol/L reduction in plasma LDL-C levels versus no intervention, in line with the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists meta-analysis of statin therapy in people at low vascular risk from 27 randomized trials showing a 21% relative risk reduction in major cardiovascular event.

### Effect of statin treatment vs usual care on primary cardiovascular prevention among older adults: the ALLHAT-LLT randomized clinical trial [^9df803fe]. JAMA Internal Medicine (2017). Medium credibility.

Importance

While statin therapy for primary cardiovascular prevention has been associated with reductions in cardiovascular morbidity, the effect on all-cause mortality has been variable. There is little evidence to guide the use of statins for primary prevention in adults 75 years and older.

Objectives

To examine statin treatment among adults aged 65 to 74 years and 75 years and older when used for primary prevention in the Lipid-Lowering Trial (LLT) component of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT-LLT).

Design, Setting, and Participants

Post hoc secondary data analyses were conducted of participants 65 years and older without evidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease; 2867 ambulatory adults with hypertension and without baseline atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease were included. The ALLHAT-LLT was conducted from February 1994 to March 2002 at 513 clinical sites.

Interventions

Pravastatin sodium (40 mg/d) vs usual care (UC).

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome in the ALLHAT-LLT was all-cause mortality. Secondary outcomes included cause-specific mortality and nonfatal myocardial infarction or fatal coronary heart disease combined (coronary heart disease events).

Results

There were 1467 participants (mean [SD] age, 71.3 [5.2] years) in the pravastatin group (48.0% [n = 704] female) and 1400 participants (mean [SD] age, 71.2 [5.2] years) in the UC group (50.8% [n = 711] female). The baseline mean (SD) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were 147.7 (19.8) mg/dL in the pravastatin group and 147.6 (19.4) mg/dL in the UC group; by year 6, the mean (SD) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were 109.1 (35.4) mg/dL in the pravastatin group and 128.8 (27.5) mg/dL in the UC group. At year 6, of the participants assigned to pravastatin, 42 of 253 (16.6%) were not taking any statin; 71.0% in the UC group were not taking any statin. The hazard ratios for all-cause mortality in the pravastatin group vs the UC group were 1.18 (95% CI, 0.97–1.42; P = 0.09) for all adults 65 years and older, 1.08 (95% CI, 0.85–1.37; P = 0.55) for adults aged 65 to 74 years, and 1.34 (95% CI, 0.98–1.84; P = 0.07) for adults 75 years and older. Coronary heart disease event rates were not significantly different among the groups. In multivariable regression, the results remained nonsignificant, and there was no significant interaction between treatment group and age.

Conclusions and Relevance

No benefit was found when pravastatin was given for primary prevention to older adults with moderate hyperlipidemia and hypertension, and a nonsignificant direction toward increased all-cause mortality with pravastatin was observed among adults 75 years and older.

Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). High credibility.

Statin effects on LDL-C and events in older adults are summarized from observational and trial data: LDL-C response to low to moderate-intensity statins was slightly greater (2–5% depending on statin and dose) among adults without ASCVD older than 75 years compared to those aged ≤ 50, and differences with high-intensity therapy were minimal. Over a median follow-up of 2.5 years, major vascular event reduction per 1 mmol/L LDL-C reduction showed adjusted HR 0.76, 0.73, 0.81, 0.81, and 0.77 across age groups with no differences by age. Among individuals without ASCVD up to age 75 in randomized statin trials, the average time to benefit was 2.5 years. Across 28 major statin trials (n = 186,854), only 8% were over age 75 and only 2% of primary prevention participants were over age 75.

### Reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol after myocardial infarction in older individuals, levels versus change: can observational studies answer the questions? [^38b481ed]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The likelihood of either a placebo or statin clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of intense statin therapy versus moderate or no statin therapy in the very elderly or the use of PCSK9 inhibitors with or without statin therapy in this very old age group (aged ≥ 80 years) with long‐term follow‐up efficacy for multiple end points would be an important contribution, extremely unlikely to occur at least in the United States.

The current article by Alter et al 10 in this issue of the Journal of the American Heart Association (JAHA) was an observational study and not a clinical trial that evaluated the potential efficacy of intensive versus moderate statin therapy in elderly individuals. The study followed up the participants for up to 8.8 years, but median follow‐up was only 2.5 years, a major limitation in interpreting the results of the study. 11 They focused on secondary prevention (ie, individuals had an MI, evaluation of risk of recurrent MIs, other CHD, CVD, and total mortality) ≥ 30 days after initial MI in relation to the level of LDL‐C measured after the heart attack for individuals receiving statin therapy. Individuals not receiving statin therapy were excluded from the study. Their result suggested little further reduction in the number of subsequent heart attacks, other CVD, stroke, CVD, or total mortality if a greater percentage of older individuals, either 65 to 74 or ≥ 75 years, had LDL‐C levels reduced to either 70 or 50 mg% by statin therapy after MI. The study does not compare the use of statins with no statin therapy in elderly individuals nor does it measure the change in LDL‐C level before and after statin therapy.

Evidence from trials

Up until now, only one randomised clinical trial (RCT), the PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER) trial, was specifically designed to evaluate statins versus placebo in older patients with and without pre-existing CVD. Other evidence on the benefits of lipid-lowering therapy in older adults is based on (meta-analyses of) subgroups of older patients from large RCTs including adults aged < 80 years. The PROSPER trialincluded 5804 patients aged 70–82 with (high risk of) CVD. In older patients with CVD, pravastatin lowered the risk of cardiovascular events or death over a period of 3.2 years (HR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.66 to 0.93). However, in patients without pre-existing CVD, contrary to most other primary prevention trials with effect sizes of 25%–30%, the relative risk (RR) reduction was only 6% and did not reach statistical significance (HR: 0.94; 0.77–1.15). This could be due to lack of power because the PROSPER trial was not designed to demonstrate a significant effect in each subgroup. Yet, this still leaves the effectiveness of statins in older adults without CVD unconfirmed. A recent meta-analysis of 28 randomised controlled trials including 14.483 patients > 75 years of age (mean (SD) age 78.8 (2.8) years) showed that in patients with pre-existing CVD the proportional reduction in cardiovascular events was similar among all age groups (p trend 0.2). The RR reduction on major vascular events for patients with CVD was 0.85; 95% CI 0.73 to 0.98 in 4.9 years of time. In patients without pre-existing CVD, mainly using subgroup results of the PROSPER trial, a smaller proportional risk reduction was observed with increasing age (p trend 0.05). No significant benefit of statins was observed for patients aged > 75 years without CVD (RR 0.92; 0.73 to 1.16). This is in line with a previously published primary prevention meta-analysis. Although ambiguous, of all older adults without CVD, data seem to suggest only (very) high-risk patients (eg, with diabetes) benefit from statins in terms of preventing CVD. In conclusion, previously performed trials show that lipid-lowering therapy benefits older adults at high absolute risk of CVD, for example, those with preexisting CVD. However, these trials did not include adults aged > 80 years and most likely no frail older adults, suggesting that these results may not apply to a great deal of the (frail) older patients encountered in daily clinical practice. Also, RCTs were not powered in terms of outcomes which are important in the majority of older adults, such as quality of life and functional status. According to the National Institute on Aging (NIA) placebo-controlled and pragmatic RCTs seem to be suitable to address these knowledge gaps, studying a full range of outcomes, such as quality of life, function and symptom burden related to statins. However, we foresee obstacles for conducting such a trial, as today most older adults already take lipid- lowering drugs, and the frailest patients are not able to participate in such trials. Perhaps only pragmatic deprescribing RCTs or analyses of electronic health records with details on incidence and severity of major side effects and drug interactions could determine benefits and harms of (de)prescribing therapy in these older adults. Pending results of such trials, other factors should be taken into account when treating hypercholesterolaemia in the oldest old and frail older adults.

### Frailty and cardiovascular health [^5e8d1d21]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2024). Medium credibility.

Lipid Reduction

Hyperlipidemia is associated with frailty, and observational data have shown an association between higher serum remnant cholesterol and higher FI scores. Guideline recommendations for secondary prevention in older adults are generally similar to those for younger adults. However, there are considerable gaps in guidelines for lipid‐lowering therapies in primary prevention, particularly in those older than 75 years, leaving management strategies largely to individualized, patient‐specific considerations. While large observational studies have shown that lipid‐lowering therapy benefits older adults, the current body of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) is limited. A meta‐analysis from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration, comprising 28 major statin trials and nearly 186 000 participants, found that statin therapy reduced vascular events and mortality, with attenuation of the benefit of statins for primary prevention in adults 75 years and older due to limited enrollment in this age group. A meta‐analysis of JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) and the HOPE‐3 (Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation‐3) trial demonstrated that rosuvastatin was superior to placebo for patients 70 years and older for preventing atherosclerotic CVD. Furthermore, despite the few published studies for the role of lipid‐lowering therapies in older adults with frailty, at least one observational study suggests similar or greater benefits of statins for mortality and MACE prevention in those with frailty.

Limitations in current data to guide statin use have partly been attributed to the heterogeneity of patient ages and geriatric complexities such as multimorbidity, frailty, cognitive decline, polypharmacy, and falls. Thus far, statin therapy has not been shown to have adverse impacts on physical function and frailty in this population. However, 2 ongoing RCTs, STAREE (Statins in Reducing Events in the Elderly) and the PREVENTABLE (Pragmatic Evaluation of Events and Benefits of Lipid Lowering in Older Adults) trials, seek to fill the gaps in CVD prevention in older adults.

### Effect of alirocumab on cardiovascular outcomes after acute coronary syndromes according to age: an ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial analysis [^5ed65b06]. European Heart Journal (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of death in older patients, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) remains a strong risk factor for cardiovascular events even at an advanced age. Statins reduce the risk of vascular mortality and major coronary events irrespective of age, although the evidence is less strong in patients above 75 years. A recent meta-analysis explored the effectiveness of statin therapy across many age categories. Overall, statin therapy compared with placebo or more intensive statin therapy compared with less intensive statin therapy reduced the risk of major coronary events, but there appeared to be a trend towards smaller proportional risk reductions with increasing age. Absolute risk reduction, however, increased with advancing age.

As older individuals were often underrepresented in the clinical trials included in that analysis, uncertainty remains regarding the balance between benefit and risk with intensive LDL-C lowering in the elderly, particularly after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). This was identified as a specific knowledge gap in an American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association scientific statement. Older patients, who are often challenging to treat, are less likely to be prescribed lipid-lowering therapies, and when statins are used the dose is often lower. Reasons include fear of side-effects, perceived lack of benefit, concerns about polypharmacy, and potential drug–drug interactions. Older patients in secondary prevention also have lower adherence to statins, which has been associated with an increased risk of death. As a consequence, few elderly patients in secondary prevention appear to achieve the LDL-C levels recommended in guidelines. In view of these limitations, additional LDL-C lowering by non-statin therapies might, therefore, be particularly appealing for older patients with established coronary artery disease.

### Statins and mortality among elderly patients hospitalized with heart failure [^868f9f9d]. Circulation (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Small studies suggest that statins may improve mortality in patients with heart failure (HF). Whether these results are generalizable to a broader group of patients with HF remains unclear. Our objective was to evaluate the association between statin use and survival among a national sample of elderly patients hospitalized with HF.

Methods and Results

A nationwide sample of 61 939 eligible Medicare beneficiaries ≥ 65 years of age who were hospitalized with a primary discharge diagnosis of HF between April 1998 and March 1999 or July 2000 and June 2001 was evaluated. The analysis was restricted to patients with no contraindications to statins (n = 54,960). Of these patients, only 16.7% received statins on discharge. Older patients were less likely to receive a statin at discharge. Patients with hyperlipidemia and those cared for by a cardiologist or cared for in a teaching hospital were more likely to receive a statin at discharge. In a Cox proportional hazards model that took into account demographic, clinical characteristics, treatments, physician specialty, and hospital characteristics, discharge statin therapy was associated with significant improvements in 1- and 3-year mortality (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.84; and hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.79 to 0.85, respectively). Regardless of total cholesterol level or coronary artery disease status, statin therapy was associated with significant differences in mortality.

Conclusions

Our data demonstrate that statin therapy is associated with better long-term mortality in older patients with HF. This study suggests a potential role for statins as an adjunct to current HF therapy. Randomized clinical trials are required to determine the role of these agents in improving outcomes in the large and growing group of patients with HF.

Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). High credibility.

Patient-centered decision framework — life expectancy, time to benefit, and frailty considerations: If the life expectancy is shorter than the time to benefit, statin therapy generally should not be recommended, and if approximately equal to the time to benefit, patient preferences should guide decisions; in advanced dementia, the time to benefit of primary prevention statin therapy may exceed life expectancy and goals may shift to reducing treatment burden and maintaining quality of life. For patients with frailty, severe functional impairment or dementia, incorporating patient preferences in statin decisions is essential, and a retrospective cohort of 326,981 Veterans aged 75 years and older without ASCVD at baseline found that new statin use was significantly associated with a lower risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, with the association evident at ages aged > 90 years, in those with dementia, and remaining significant in those with frailty.

### Statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular events and mortality in old and very old adults with and without type 2 diabetes: retrospective cohort study [^33c40d57]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

A possible survival effect should also be considered. Study participants had reached age 75 years with no vascular disease, which could partially explain the limited effect size of statin treatment observed in this population. Finally, we cannot dismiss the possibility that a proportion of non-statin users might have taken statins previous to the washout period, potentially allowing a lagged effect of some statins that could partially explain the observed lack of differences between users and non-users without type 2 diabetes.

It is rather complex to establish a precise cut-off point for the age at which statins no longer have a beneficial effect in people with diabetes. However, in our data the effect was substantially reduced after age 85 years and disappeared in nonagenarians.

Comparison with other studies

The effectiveness of statins for primary prevention in people aged 75 years or older has elicited wide controversy. The only clinical trial specifically designed for elderly people, the Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER), included patients aged 70–82 years (mean 75 years), with a high proportion of participants in secondary prevention of CVD. Although no beneficial effect was found in the subanalysis including only participants in primary prevention.

There are studies supporting the benefit of statins on cardiovascular disease but not on mortality. Within the JUPITER trial (Justification for Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin), a subanalysis of patients older than 70 years (median 74 years), showed a 39% reduction of CVD in participants treated with statins, but no beneficial effect on mortality. Two meta-analyses have also addressed the statin effect in cardiovascular primary prevention. Savarese et al included participants older than 65 years (mean 73 years) and found that statins were associated with a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of myocardial infarction and stroke but not in overall mortality. Teng et al also included patients older than 65 years (mean 72.7 years), but found statins to be significantly effective only in reducing the incidence of myocardial infarction but not of stroke or overall mortality.

### Present status of statin therapy [^55cc7e2b]. Trends in Cardiovascular Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Statins are cardioprotective agents that reduce the adverse effects of increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. For significantly dyslipidemic persons, who are at higher cardiovascular risk, combined statin therapy substantially reduces the mortality risk, thus potentially being an ideal risk-reducing combination with added risk reduction by lifestyle changes. Decisions regarding the initiation of statin therapy for primary prevention where the absolute risk reduction is much less are more difficult, involving LDL-C levels and higher C-reactive protein levels. For significantly dyslipidemic persons, combined intense exercise and statin therapy substantially reduces the mortality risk, thus potentially being an ideal risk-reducing combination.

### The effects of cholesterol lowering with simvastatin on cause-specific mortality and on cancer incidence in 20, 536 high-risk people: a randomised placebo-controlled trial [^e6e915f5]. BMC Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Based on large numbers of deaths and other relevant outcomes, the present results show that lowering LDL cholesterol by an average of 1 mmol/L produces substantial reductions in vascular (and, hence, all-cause) mortality in a wide range of individuals at increased risk of occlusive arterial disease (as well as reducing their risks of heart attacks, strokes and revascularisation procedures). These results also provide considerable reassurance that lowering total cholesterol concentrations by more than 1 mmol/L for an average of 5 years does not produce adverse effects on non-vascular mortality or cancer incidence, even among those who had their cholesterol concentrations reduced to very low levels. Indirectly, this observation provides some reassurance about the likely efficacy and safety of the more intensive cholesterol-lowering achievable with higher-dose or newer statins, and with combinations of standard statin doses and drugs acting through other pathways (such as resins or cholesterol absorption inhibitors). The present results provide further evidence of the benefits and safety of using statin therapy routinely in anyone (irrespective of their initial cholesterol concentration or other factors, such as age or gender) in whom a reduction in their vascular disease risk of about one third would be considered worthwhile.

### Benefits of pravastatin on cardiovascular events and mortality in older patients with coronary heart disease are equal to or exceed those seen in younger patients: results from the LIPID trial [^151e490e]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The effect of cholesterol-lowering therapy on death from coronary heart disease in older patients with previous coronary heart disease and average cholesterol levels is uncertain.

Objective

To compare the relative and absolute effects of pravastatin on cardiovascular disease outcomes in patients with coronary heart disease who are 65 years of age or older with those in patients 31 to 64 years of age.

Design

Subgroup analysis of a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.

Setting

87 centers in Australia and New Zealand.

Patients

3514 patients 65 to 75 years of age, chosen from among 9014 patients with previous myocardial infarction or unstable angina and a baseline plasma cholesterol level of 4.0 to 7.0 mmol/L (155 to 271 mg/dL).

Intervention

Pravastatin, 40 mg/d, or placebo.

Measurements

Major cardiovascular disease events over 6 years.

Results

Older patients were at greater risk than younger patients (31 to 64 years of age) for death (20.6% vs. 9.8%), myocardial infarction (11.4% vs. 9.5%), unstable angina (26.7% vs. 23.2%), and stroke (6.7% vs. 3.1%) (all P < 0.001). Pravastatin reduced the risk for all cardiovascular disease events, and similar relative effects were observed in older and younger patients. In patients 65 to 75 years of age, pravastatin therapy reduced mortality by 21% (CI, 7% to 32%), death from coronary heart disease by 24% (CI, 7% to 38%), coronary heart disease death or nonfatal myocardial infarction by 22% (CI, 9% to 34%), myocardial infarction by 26% (CI, 9% to 40%), and stroke by 12% (CI, -15% to 32%). For every 1000 older patients treated over 6 years, pravastatin prevented 45 deaths, 33 myocardial infarctions, 32 unstable angina events, 34 coronary revascularization procedures, 13 strokes, or 133 major cardiovascular events, compared with 22 deaths and 107 major cardiovascular events per 1000 younger patients. Among older patients, the numbers needed to treat were 22 (CI, 17 to 36) to prevent one death from any cause, 35 (CI, 24 to 67) to prevent one death from coronary heart disease, and 21 (CI, 17 to 31) to prevent one coronary heart disease death or nonfatal myocardial infarction.

Conclusions

In older patients with coronary heart disease and average or moderately elevated cholesterol levels, pravastatin therapy reduced the risk for all major cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality. Since older patients are at greater risk than younger patients for these events, the absolute benefit of treatment is significantly greater in older patients.

### Effects on 11-year mortality and morbidity of lowering LDL cholesterol with simvastatin for about 5 years in 20, 536 high-risk individuals: a randomised controlled trial [^a0993ed4]. Lancet (2011). Excellent credibility.

Background

Findings of large randomised trials have shown that lowering LDL cholesterol with statins reduces vascular morbidity and mortality rapidly, but limited evidence exists about the long-term efficacy and safety of statin treatment. The aim of the extended follow-up of the Heart Protection Study (HPS) is to assess long-term efficacy and safety of lowering LDL cholesterol with statins, and here we report cause-specific mortality and major morbidity in the in-trial and post-trial periods.

Methods

20,536 patients at high risk of vascular and non-vascular outcomes were allocated either 40 mg simvastatin daily or placebo, using minimised randomisation. Mean in-trial follow-up was 5·3 years (SD 1·2), and post-trial follow-up of surviving patients yielded a mean total duration of 11·0 years (SD 0·6). The primary outcome of the long-term follow-up of HPS was first post-randomisation major vascular event, and analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number 48489393.

Findings

During the in-trial period, allocation to simvastatin yielded an average reduction in LDL cholesterol of 1·0 mmol/L and a proportional decrease in major vascular events of 23% (95% CI 19–28; p < 0·0001), with significant divergence each year after the first. During the post-trial period (when statin use and lipid concentrations were similar in both groups), no further significant reductions were noted in either major vascular events (risk ratio [RR] 0·95 [0·89–1·02]) or vascular mortality (0·98 [0·90–1·07]). During the combined in-trial and post-trial periods, no significant differences were recorded in cancer incidence at all sites (0·98 [0·92–1·05]) or any particular site, or in mortality attributed to cancer (1·01 [0·92–1·11]) or to non-vascular causes (0·96 [0·89–1·03]).

Interpretation

More prolonged LDL-lowering statin treatment produces larger absolute reductions in vascular events. Moreover, even after study treatment stopped in HPS, benefits persisted for at least 5 years without any evidence of emerging hazards. These findings provide further support for the prompt initiation and long-term continuation of statin treatment.

### Statin discontinuation and cardiovascular events among older people in Denmark… [^1fcc6e5c]. JAMA Network (2021). Excellent credibility.

Findings In this cohort study of 27 463 people treated with statins for primary prevention and 39 955 treated for secondary prevention, statin discontinuation was associated with a significantly higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular events for primary prevention and secondary prevention compared with treatment continuation. Meaning In this study, statin discontinuation was associated with a higher rate of cardiovascular events than statin continuation among older people receiving long-term statin treatment, but more definitive evidence is needed. Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study, among older adults receiving long-term statin treatment, discontinuation of statins was associated with a higher rate of MACE compared with statin continuation in both the primary and the secondary prevention cohorts. These findings suggest a need for robust evidence from randomized clinical trials.

In our post hoc analyses, statin discontinuation was associated with a higher rate of all-cause mortality and noncardiovascular mortality. In our negative control outcome analysis, statin discontinuation was associated with a higher rate of hip fracture in both the primary and the secondary prevention cohorts. In this cohort study, statin discontinuation was associated with a higher rate of occurrence of MACE compared with statin continuation among older people receiving long-term statin treatment for both primary and secondary prevention. Although the relative effect estimates for statin discontinuation were similar in both cohorts, the overall rate of cardiovascular events and the magnitude of the rate difference between discontinuation and continuation were higher in the secondary prevention cohort than among statin users without a history of cardiovascular disease.

In a recent observational study conducted in France19 that included older persons aged 75 years with no history of cardiovascular disease, statin discontinuation was associated with an increased risk of hospitalizations for cardiovascular events during the 2. 5-year follow-up. In this cohort study, among older Danes receiving long-term statin treatment, discontinuation was associated with a higher rate of MACE compared with statin continuation. Although the relative effect of statin discontinuation was similar in the primary and secondary prevention cohorts, the rate difference was larger in the secondary prevention cohort. These findings suggest a need for further evidence from RCTs on this topic to inform shared decision-making in clinical practice.

### Lipid-lowering therapy with statins in high-risk elderly patients: the treatment-risk paradox [^925e6fdf]. JAMA (2004). Excellent credibility.

Context

The benefits of cardiovascular therapies such as statins for secondary prevention have been well documented, although they may not be optimally used in patients most likely to benefit. Ideally, aggressiveness in the use of these beneficial therapies should correlate with baseline cardiovascular risk.

Objective

To examine the association between physicians' treatment aggressiveness and baseline cardiovascular risk.

Design, Setting, and Patients

Retrospective cohort study incorporating the use of multiple linked health care administrative databases covering more than 1.4 million elderly residents of Ontario. We included 396,077 patients aged 66 years or older who had a history of cardiovascular disease or diabetes while undergoing medical treatment and who were alive on April 1, 1998. Baseline cardiovascular risk was derived using a risk-adjustment index in which we modeled probability of death after 3 years of follow-up.

Main Outcome Measure

Likelihood of statin use, stratified by baseline cardiovascular risk, after adjusting for age, sex, socioeconomic status, and rural or urban residence.

Results

Only 75,617 patients (19.1%) in this secondary prevention cohort were prescribed statins. In patients 66 to 74 years old, the adjusted probabilities of statin prescription were 37.7%, 26.7%, and 23.4% in the categories of low, intermediate, and high baseline risk, respectively. The likelihood of statin prescription was 6.4% lower (adjusted odds ratio, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.93–0.95) for each year of increase in age and each 1% increase in predicted 3-year mortality risk. The influence of age also interacted synergistically with baseline risk on the prescription of statins (P < .001).

Conclusions

We found that prescription of statins diminished progressively as baseline cardiovascular risk and future probability of death increased. Since the benefits of a therapy are dependent on the baseline risk, the maximum benefits of statins may not be fully realized until implementation of therapy includes patients at highest risk.

Journal of the American Geriatrics Society (2025). Medium credibility.

Recommendation‐specifc supportive text

There is substantial variability in life expectancy among older adults of the same age, e.g. a healthy 85‐year‐old woman is expected to live an additional 10 years (and would be likely to benefit from primary prevention) while a frail, multimorbid 85‐year‐old woman may have less than 2 years remaining life expectancy and may not stand to benefit. Clinicians can consider morbidity burden, functional status and frailty to estimate life expectancy. If an individual's life expectancy is greater than the time to benefit for a given preventive intervention, the intervention may help and should generally be recommended. If the life expectancy is shorter than the time to benefit, the intervention is more likely to harm and generally should not be recommended. If the life expectancy is approximately equal to the time to benefit, patient preferences should be the guiding factor in decision making. An online calculator, ePrognosis, can help clinicians incorporate evidence‐based information about life expectancy for older adults into decisions about preventive therapies such as statins. For example, for an individual with advanced dementia, the time to benefit of primary prevention statin therapy may exceed life expectancy and the goals of therapy may shift over time from preventing illness and prolonging life to reducing the burden of treatment and maintaining quality of life.
For patients with frailty, severe functional impairment or dementia, incorporating patient preferences in decisions about statin therapy is essential for patient‐centered care. These conditions are associated with physical and functional decline, increased mortality risk, and increased risk of harm from polypharmacy. Yet, individuals with frailty, functional impairment and dementia should not automatically be denied statin therapy. Although few studies have included such patients, a retrospective cohort study of 326,981 Veterans aged 75 years and older without ASCVD at baseline found that new statin use was significantly associated with a lower risk of all‐cause and cardiovascular mortality, even at advanced ages (e.g. aged > 90 years) and in those with dementia. This association was evident within 2 years and remained significant in those with frailty. However, for some patients with frailty, severe functional impairment or dementia, goals of therapy may shift from preventing illness and prolonging life to reducing the burden of treatment and maintaining quality of life. Practical tools to assess functional status, frailty and cognition are listed in Table 5. The presence of any of these syndromes may prompt elicitation of patient values and preferences for prevention and medication use (see Question 6, Section 2).

### Association of statin use and mortality after transcatheter aortic valve replacement [^ea547618]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Among patients with severe, symptomatic aortic stenosis, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) improves survival and quality of life compared with medical therapy. 1, 2 Despite the improvement in survival conferred by TAVR, mortality rates after TAVR remain high, 3, 4 as patients undergoing TAVR are often elderly with multiple cardiovascular and noncardiovascular comorbidities. A number of strategies have been employed to reduce post‐TAVR mortality further, including improving patient selection, limiting periprocedural complications (eg, reducing sheath size to decrease vascular complications, computed tomography sizing, and sealing skirts to reduce paravalvular leaks), and improving postprocedure care (eg, less intensive care time and earlier mobilization). However, there is a continued need to investigate strategies that may provide further mortality reduction after TAVR.

Statins are well established as a key therapy to reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality, especially among patients at high‐risk for cardiovascular events. However, the role of statins in older adults is uncertain. Due to competing mortality risks along with concerns for side effects and polypharmacy in the elderly population, current American clinical practice guidelines do not recommend statin therapy for patients > 75 years of age for primary prevention with the decision to treat patients, and shared decision making is advised for secondary preventions. 5 Despite the high rate of post‐TAVR mortality, it is unclear whether statins are associated with improved outcomes after TAVR. In addition to their cardiovascular benefits, statins may potentially reduce mortality via nonatherosclerotic or pleiotropic effects (eg, reducing acute kidney injury 6 and other surgical complications). 7 One study that examined the relationship of statins with post‐TAVR outcomes found that statin use was associated with lower mortality at 2 years compared with no statin use. 8 A different study found no association of statins with mortality at 2 years after TAVR. 9 However, because these were single‐center studies with relatively small sample sizes and the inherent risk of bias due to nonrandom treatment assignment in observational studies, leveraging statistical methods that increase the comparability between groups across key characteristics is important. We performed a propensity‐matched analysis among a large, prospective, adjudicated, multicenter cohort of patients who underwent TAVR to examine the association of statin use with the risk of mortality after TAVR.

### Class effects of statins in elderly patients with congestive heart failure: a population-based analysis [^a4c48c6f]. American Heart Journal (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Long-term treatment with statins reduces mortality in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Whether statin agents exert a class effect is unknown.

Methods

We analyzed long-term mortality in Canadian patients aged ≥ 65 years who were discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of CHF from January 1998 to December 2002. Administrative data from Quebec, Ontario, and British Columbia were merged. We compared patients prescribed with atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, and lovastatin.

Results

A total of 15,368 patients hospitalized with a diagnosis of CHF fulfilled the inclusion criteria for this study. In this final dataset, 6670 (43.4%) filled a prescription for atorvastatin, 4261 (27.7%) for simvastatin, 3209 (20.9%) for pravastatin, and 1228 (8.0%) for lovastatin. Clinical characteristics and proportion of days covered with a statin prescription were similar across groups. Drug dosages were relatively low, with 82% of patients who received the agent at a dose of ≤ 20 mg. Although controlling for time-dependent covariates representing current use and dosage, as well as for age, sex, coronary artery disease, and several other comorbidities, treatment with pravastatin (adjusted hazards ratio [HR] 0.94, 95% CI 0.83–1.07), lovastatin (adjusted HR 1.02, 95% CI 0.88–1.17), or simvastatin (adjusted HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.83–1.01) had a similar effectiveness to prevent mortality compared to atorvastatin (reference in this analysis) in this population with CHF. Time-dependent exposure to a statin was highly protective against mortality.

Conclusions

Statins exert a class effect in patients with CHF, when used at a relatively low dose. The favorable effects appear largely independent of drug dosage.

### Changes in cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular events in the elderly population [^b4942630]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Individual CVH Metrics and CVD Risk in the Very Elderly Population

Because of the lack of data in the very elderly participants, there are no clinical support tools specifically designed to assess cardiovascular risk in this population. Statin therapy, blood pressure control, smoking cessation, physical activity, and maintaining a normal body weight are interventions that have been shown to reduce the incidence of primary cardiovascular events in the very elderly. The present study showed that maintaining optimal BMI and cholesterol level were not related with reduced mortality in both the elderly and very elderly population. No significant association of BMI with outcomes might be attributable to the obesity paradox. For example, obesity is associated with mortality at a younger age, but not at an older age. Thus, the association might be driven by this age difference.

The association between weight loss and cardiovascular mortality is less clear in the very elderly population. Ghaem Maralani et al reported that obesity increased risk of CVD‐related death only in those aged < 70 years, but not in those aged ≥ 70 years. Takata et al observed a similar outcome that cardiovascular mortality was 78% less in overweight octogenarians than in those who were underweight. Thus, although dietary recommendations can be made for the very elderly participants, weight loss recommendations for this population are not well supported by the literature.

The best available evidence for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in older adults supports the use of statin therapy and blood pressure control. This study showed ideal total cholesterol was positively associated with CVD events in elderly participants. It can be a benefit from lipid‐lowering therapy. Statin therapy reduces the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke, although close monitoring for adverse events is warranted. It was the same in the Asian very elderly (≥ 75 years) population. However, in participants aged > 75 years because of the lack of evidence, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce cardiovascular risk in adults do not recommend using their atherosclerotic risk calculator. It is suggested that therapy could be considered on the basis of a discussion of benefits and risks, adverse effects, drug interactions, and patient preference.

### Efficacy and safety of statin therapy in older people: a meta-analysis of individual participant data from 28 randomised controlled trials [^1afdde51]. Lancet (2019). Excellent credibility.

Methods

Study design and outcomes

The methods of the CTT Collaboration have been described previously, and were agreed before the reporting of any individual trial results. Randomised trials were eligible for inclusion if the main effect of at least one of the trial interventions was to lower LDL cholesterol, the trial was unconfounded with respect to this intervention (ie, no other differences in modification of risk factors between the relevant treatment groups were intended), and the trial aimed to recruit 1000 or more participants with a scheduled treatment duration of at least 2 years.

As for all CTT analyses, the risk of bias was low because of prespecified study methods, the ability to adjust for heterogeneity by weighting rate ratios (RRs) according to trial-level absolute differences in LDL cholesterol, and the low probability of publication bias due to a prospective design with prespecified study eligibility. Prespecified outcomes included major coronary events (defined as non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death), coronary revascularisation (angioplasty or bypass grafting), stroke (subdivided by type), site-specific cancers, and cause-specific mortality. Subsequently, we defined major vascular events as the composite of major coronary events, coronary revascularisation, and stroke.

### Statins are associated with a large reduction in all-cause mortality in women from a cardiac outpatient population [^5f6e3071]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This study shows that fewer women eligible for statin therapy received statins compared with men, and when they did, they more often received a low-intensity statin. Statin prescription for primary prevention reduced the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality to a greater extent in women compared with men. High-intensity statins conferred modest additional protection against both mortality outcomes and this effect was similar for women and men.

The main strength of our study was the use of a clinical care database that closely reflects the current situation in clinical care, both regarding statin prescription practices and patients that are seen at such outpatient clinics. Women were well represented (52%) and the majority of patients (55%) had a low (< 5%) 10-year risk of cardiovascular mortality, which is exactly the patient population for whom more evidence regarding statin efficacy is warranted. The main limitation of our study is that data collection was driven by medical need and thus not performed systematically. Residual confounding may remain despite our efforts to control for confounding by indication. This may have biased our findings towards the null because patients with a higher mortality risk have a higher chance of being prescribed (high-intensity) statins, which would reduce the difference in survival between statin users and non-users and low-intensity and high-intensity statin users. We were also unable to evaluate more short-term outcomes that may be relevant in this low-risk population such as cardiovascular events and hospitalisations, and lacked good-quality data on adverse drug reactions. We were unable to correct for potential sex differences in adherence, but this is unlikely to change the interpretation of our findings because literature suggests women have poorer adherence than men, which would lead us to underestimate the observed benefit in women.

### Efficacy and safety of lowering LDL cholesterol in older patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials [^3621ace7]. Lancet (2020). Excellent credibility.

Background

The clinical benefit of LDL cholesterol lowering treatment in older patients remains debated. We aimed to summarise the evidence of LDL cholesterol lowering therapies in older patients.

Methods

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE and Embase for articles published between March 1, 2015, and Aug 14, 2020, without any language restrictions. We included randomised controlled trials of cardiovascular outcomes of an LDL cholesterol-lowering drug recommended by the 2018 American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines, with a median follow-up of at least 2 years and data on older patients (aged ≥ 75 years). We excluded trials that exclusively enrolled participants with heart failure or on dialysis because guidelines do not recommend lipid-lowering therapy in such patients who do not have another indication. We extracted data for older patients using a standardised data form for aggregated study-level data. We meta-analysed the risk ratio (RR) for major vascular events (a composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or other acute coronary syndrome, stroke, or coronary revascularisation) per 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol.

Findings

Data from six articles were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, which included 24 trials from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration meta-analysis plus five individual trials. Among 244090 patients from 29 trials, 21492 (8·8%) were aged at least 75 years, of whom 11750 (54·7%) were from statin trials, 6209 (28·9%) from ezetimibe trials, and 3533 (16·4%) from PCSK9 inhibitor trials. Median follow-up ranged from 2·2 years to 6·0 years. LDL cholesterol lowering significantly reduced the risk of major vascular events (n = 3519) in older patients by 26% per 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol (RR 0·74 [95% CI 0·61–0·89]; p = 0·0019), with no statistically significant difference with the risk reduction in patients younger than 75 years (0·85 [0·78–0·92]; p interaction = 0·37). Among older patients, RRs were not statistically different for statin (0·82 [0·73–0·91]) and non-statin treatment (0·67 [0·47–0·95]; p interaction = 0·64). The benefit of LDL cholesterol lowering in older patients was observed for each component of the composite, including cardiovascular death (0·85 [0·74–0·98]), myocardial infarction (0·80 [0·71–0·90]), stroke (0·73 [0·61–0·87]), and coronary revascularisation (0·80 [0·66–0·96]).

Interpretation

In patients aged 75 years and older, lipid lowering was as effective in reducing cardiovascular events as it was in patients younger than 75 years. These results should strengthen guideline recommendations for the use of lipid-lowering therapies, including non-statin treatment, in older patients.

Funding

None.

NNT declines with advancing age consistent with greater benefit in the older compared to younger age groups.

QUESTION 2
For the population of adults older than 75 years without established ASCVD, how should ASCVD risk be assessed and stratified?

Synopsis

Calibrating the use and intensity of preventive therapies to an individual's absolute ASCVD risk is the foundation of risk assessment. Generally, this includes (a) the use of risk stratification tools to estimate 10‐year risk of an ASCVD event, (b) personalizing this risk estimate, and (c) then further refining this risk using imaging in select patients. For older adults, several risk stratification tools are available (Table 1). Since chronologic age is one of the most heavily weighted risk factors in all the currently available risk stratification tools, these tools are limited by a lack of specificity in identifying older adults most likely to benefit from preventive therapies including statin therapy. Most risk stratification tools do not incorporate other considerations that are very important in older adults including co‐morbidities, life expectancy, functional status, frailty, and cognition and most do not take into account the competing risk of non‐cardiovascular mortality, which may lead to the over‐estimation of ASCVD risk and of the potential benefit from risk factor reduction. Use of models that adjust for competing risk in older adults can help estimate individualized treatment effects and inform clinical decision making. Assessment of vascular age using markers of subclinical atherosclerosis (e.g. CAC scoring [Table 2]) can assist clinicians in refining risk assessment and identifying older adults most likely to benefit from preventive therapies including statin therapy. Lifestyle therapy including a heart healthy diet and physical activity remains first line therapy in older adults, regardless of the results of risk assessment, given the independent association with all‐cause mortality and favorable impact on physical functioning and mental wellbeing.

Recommendation-specific supportive text — statin therapy in adults older than 75 years reports that 6 statin trials have enrolled participants older than 75 years, with few individuals over 80 years, and that in PROSPER data on the 2,355 participants over age 75 have only been published in aggregate including those with and without prior ASCVD.

Absolute risk reduction in cardiovascular disease over 5 years was 1.20% (95% CI 0.57%-1.82%) among individuals aged 75 to 84 years and 4.44% (95% CI 1.40%-7.48%) among those aged 85 years or older, with no increase in myopathies or liver dysfunction in either group. Two ongoing randomized trials, the STAREE trial and the PREVENTABLE Trial are assessing benefits and risks of statin therapy in this age group prospectively.

### Statins are associated with a large reduction in all-cause mortality in women from a cardiac outpatient population [^f66b7bb5]. Open Heart (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Statins have been shown to effectively lower the risk of cardiovascular events by reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, with high-intensity regiments being more effective than low-intensity variants. This effect is seen independently of baseline mortality risk, suggesting that all people at risk of cardiovascular events benefit from treatment. However, women are less likely to receive guideline-recommended statin therapy than men in both primary and secondary prevention. It has been shown that women are more likely to refuse or stop statin therapyand that healthcare professionals are also less likely to prescribe (high-intensity) statins for women. This careful approach may stem from remaining uncertainty about the benefit of statin therapy as primary prevention strategy for women due to the low number of women in primary prevention trials.

There is some evidence to suggest that women and men may benefit equally from statin treatment. The Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin trial showed that rosuvastatin reduced the risk of cardiovascular events and cardiovascular mortality in both women and men. In addition, data from a primary care cohort of new statin users showed that improved adherence to statins reduced the risk of hospitalisation for cardiovascular events in both men and women to a similar extent. While some meta-analyses of primary prevention trials confirmed that statin treatment benefits both sexes, others failed to find such positive effects. Moreover, it remains unclear whether the intensity of therapy influences outcomes. Therefore, we used regular care data from cardiac outpatient clinics to study whether receiving a statin prescription for primary prevention affects long-term prognosis in women and men without a history of cardiovascular disease. We also explored whether high-intensity statins confer additional protection over low-intensity regimens.
