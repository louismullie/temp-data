## Question

How is glucose turned into uric acid?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how glucose is turned into uric acid. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about whether glucose can be directly converted to uric acid or whether this requires an indirect route. Then, I should verify the key indirect pathway via endogenous fructose production and its ATP-depleting metabolism. Next, I will trace the purine degradation cascade from AMP to uric acid and check the regulatory role of inorganic phosphate. After that, I should review direct evidence linking glucose to uric acid generation in hepatocytes. Finally, I will consider clinical implications and reconcile any conflicting data before summarizing the pathway succinctly.

> Let me first confirm the core premise: glucose is not directly converted to uric acid. Uric acid is the end product of purine catabolism, so any glucose-to-urate link must be indirect, typically via fructose generation and subsequent purine turnover, or via hepatic phosphate stress during high glucose flux [^116q9yKJ] [^114mDigD] [^1138qb7i].

> Wait, let me verify the indirect route via endogenous fructose. Under pathologic conditions such as diabetes, hyperglycemia, or dehydration, the polyol pathway converts glucose to sorbitol via aldose reductase, and sorbitol is then oxidized to fructose, creating an endogenous fructose source that can engage fructokinase-driven ATP depletion and purine degradation [^116q9yKJ] [^114DtDeB].

> I will now examine the fructose-to-uric acid mechanism. Fructokinase (ketohexokinase) phosphorylates fructose to fructose-1-phosphate without feedback regulation, trapping inorganic phosphate and transiently depleting ATP; the resulting ADP/AMP accumulation and phosphate deficit disinhibit AMP deaminase, initiating purine degradation to IMP, inosine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine, with xanthine oxidase generating uric acid and reactive oxygen species as byproducts [^114mDigD] [^114U6uQX] [^112S6qdi].

> Hold on, I should verify the phosphate-dependent regulation. AMP deaminase is normally inhibited by physiological inorganic phosphate. When phosphate is sequestered during rapid phosphorylation of sugars, AMP deaminase is activated, accelerating AMP degradation and downstream uric acid formation, which mechanistically couples sugar flux to purine turnover and urate generation [^1138qb7i] [^116AkZDs].

> Next, I should review direct evidence that glucose itself can increase uric acid. In hepatocyte models, elevated glucose concentrations increase the GCK-to-GCKR ratio, promote accumulation of phosphorylated intermediates, and transiently lower inorganic phosphate, leading to ATP depletion and increased uric acid production. This effect is attenuated by GCKR overexpression, supporting a glucose-driven phosphate-stress mechanism rather than a direct purine conversion [^1138qb7i] [^113YdkgK] [^114NABrc].

> But wait, what about clinical implications and corroborating data. High fructose intake acutely raises serum uric acid in humans, whereas isocaloric glucose generally does not, reinforcing that fructose is the primary driver; however, endogenous fructose production during hyperglycemia and the hepatic phosphate stress response to high glucose can still modestly increase uric acid, and SGLT2 inhibitors lower uric acid partly by increasing urinary urate excretion via GLUT9-mediated exchange, which modulates the net urate balance without altering production per se [^113eEDnz] [^116q9yKJ] [^113nSpwB] [^1139Z5Zy].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought glucose might directly feed purine synthesis via the pentose phosphate pathway to increase uric acid, but I should double-check that. On reconsideration, while glucose carbon can enter the pentose phosphate pathway to generate ribose-5-phosphate for de novo purine synthesis, the dominant uric acid–raising mechanism from glucose is indirect via endogenous fructose and hepatic phosphate stress rather than a direct glucose-to-urate conversion, so I need to correct that overstatement and keep the emphasis on the fructose and phosphate-stress axes [^116q9yKJ] [^1138qb7i].

> Let me synthesize the pathway succinctly. Glucose is converted to sorbitol by aldose reductase, sorbitol is oxidized to fructose, fructose is rapidly phosphorylated by fructokinase trapping phosphate and depleting ATP, AMP accumulates and AMP deaminase is disinhibited by low phosphate, purine degradation proceeds through IMP, inosine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine, and xanthine oxidase generates uric acid with ROS, with an additional, smaller contribution from direct hepatic phosphate stress during high glucose flux that accelerates purine turnover to uric acid [^116q9yKJ] [^114mDigD] [^1138qb7i].

Glucose is not directly converted to uric acid; instead, **high glucose drives endogenous fructose production** via the polyol pathway [^116q9yKJ], and fructose metabolism depletes ATP and phosphate, triggering purine degradation to uric acid [^114mDigD] [^113eEDnz]. This indirect pathway is amplified by oxidative stress and inflammation, which further increase uric acid synthesis [^112bbxBs]. Clinically, **hyperglycemia is linked to hyperuricemia** through this fructose-mediated mechanism, and SGLT2 inhibitors lower uric acid by increasing renal excretion and reducing fructose-driven production [^111yDEen] [^114UyTmM].

## Indirect conversion of glucose to uric acid

### Polyol pathway and endogenous fructose production

- **Polyol pathway**: High intracellular glucose is reduced by aldose reductase to sorbitol, then oxidized by sorbitol dehydrogenase to fructose [^114DtDeB].
- **Fructose metabolism**: Fructose is rapidly phosphorylated by fructokinase to fructose-1-phosphate, consuming ATP and trapping phosphate, causing ATP depletion and phosphate loss [^114mDigD] [^113eEDnz].
- **ATP depletion and purine degradation**: Low ATP and phosphate activate AMP deaminase, converting AMP to IMP and driving purine degradation to uric acid [^114mDigD] [^114U6uQX].

---

### Purine degradation pathway

AMP deaminase converts AMP to IMP, which is then converted to inosine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine; xanthine oxidase then oxidizes xanthine to uric acid, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) that promote oxidative stress and inflammation [^1138qb7i] [^11357TBV].

## Molecular mechanisms linking glucose metabolism to uric acid production

| **Mechanism** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Polyol pathway | Glucose → sorbitol → fructose; fructose metabolism depletes ATP and phosphate, triggering purine degradation [^114DtDeB] [^114mDigD] |
| AMP deaminase activation | ATP depletion and phosphate loss activate AMP deaminase, initiating purine degradation to uric acid [^114mDigD] [^114U6uQX] |
| Xanthine oxidase activity | Oxidizes xanthine to uric acid, generating ROS and promoting oxidative stress [^114mDigD] [^11357TBV] |
| Oxidative stress and inflammation | ROS and inflammation further increase uric acid synthesis and exacerbate hyperuricemia [^notfound] |

## Clinical implications and therapeutic considerations

- **Hyperuricemia and metabolic syndrome**: Hyperglycemia-induced uric acid production contributes to hyperuricemia, gout, and metabolic syndrome [^114mDigD] [^114kd17o].
- **SGLT2 inhibitors**: Reduce uric acid by increasing renal excretion and decreasing fructose-driven production, lowering serum uric acid by ~0.6–1.5 mg/dL and gout risk by 30–50% [^111yDEen] [^114UyTmM].
- **Dietary interventions**: Reducing added sugars and fructose intake lowers uric acid and improves metabolic outcomes [^112S8ZQY].

---

Glucose is not directly converted to uric acid; rather, **high glucose drives endogenous fructose production**, whose metabolism depletes ATP and phosphate, activates purine degradation, and generates uric acid, with oxidative stress and inflammation amplifying this effect [^116q9yKJ] [^114mDigD] [^114DtDeB].

### Fructose-rich beverages and risk of gout in women… [^113eEDnz]. JAMA Network (2010). Excellent credibility.

Fructose induces uric acid production by increasing adenosine triphosphate degradation to adenosine monophosphate, a uric acid precursor. The phosphorylation of fructose to fructose-1-phosphate by fructokinase leads to the degradation of ATP to adenosine diphosphate. As fructose-1-phosphate entraps inorganic phosphate, intracellular Pi levels decrease. As a net result, intracellular ATP levels decrease and AMP levels increase, which also leads to increased inosine monophosphate levels. Elevated AMP and IMP levels activate catabolic pathways, which leads to increased uric acid production. beverages contain low levels of purine, they contain large amounts of fructose, which is the only carbohydrate known to increase uric acid levels. 8–10 In humans, acute oral or intravenous administration of fructose results in a rapid increase in serum uric acid via accentuated degradation of purine nucleotides and increased purine synthesis.

11, 12 Furthermore, this urate-increasing effect was found to be exaggerated in individuals with hyperuricemia9 or a history of gout.
8. Free fructose and total fructose intake were categorized into quintiles based on percentage of energy. Fructose induces uric acid production by increasing adenosine triphosphate degradation to adenosine monophosphate, a uric acid precursor. 12, 28, 33 Fructose phosphorylation in the liver uses ATP, and the accompanying phosphate depletion limits regeneration of ATP from adenosine. diphosphate, which in turn serves as substrate for the catabolic pathway to uric acid formation. 34 Thus, within minutes after fructose infusion, plasma uric acid concentrations are increased. 28 In conjunction with purine nucleotide depletion, rates of purine synthesis de novo are accelerated, thus potentiating uric acid production. 11 In contrast, glucose and other simple sugars do not have the same effect.

Furthermore, fructose could indirectly increase serum uric acid level and risk of gout by increasing insulin resistance and circulating insulin levels. 36 Experimental studies in animal models and from short-term feeding trials among humans suggest that higher fructose intake contributes to insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, and hyperinsulinemia. 23, 37, 38 In contrast, glucose intake had no similar adverse effects. 38.

### Elevated glucose represses liver glucokinase and induces its regulatory protein to safeguard hepatic phosphate homeostasis [^116AkZDs]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

Uric acid production by hepatocytes is dependent on glucose metabolism.

The transient decline in ATP despite sustained elevation in glucose 6-P (Fig. 7 A and B) is most likely due to a transient decline in cell inorganic phosphate (Pi), as occurs with fructose loading. To test for this possibility, we determined uric acid formation as an index of cytoplasmic Pi depletion. Uric acid is the end product of purine degradation in the human liver (Fig. 8 A). Degradation of adenine nucleotides to uric acid involves conversion of AMP to inosine monophosphate by AMP deaminase, which is allosterically inhibited by physiological concentrations of Pi. The enzyme is activated by Pi depletion, and consequently uric acid production is a sensitive index of cell Pi depletion. Because uric acid is further metabolized by uric acid oxidase to S-allantoin in rat hepatocytes (Fig. 8 A), we used oxonic acid, an inhibitor of uric acid oxidase, to measure uric acid formation. Oxonic acid caused concentration-dependent inhibition of degradation of exogenous uric acid (Fig. 8 B), and it increased endogenous uric acid accumulation during incubation of hepatocytes with fructose (Fig. 8 C). In the presence of 0.5 mmol/L oxonic acid, the basal rate of uric acid production was stimulated by fructose in a concentration-dependent manner and to a lesser extent by 25–35 mmol/L glucose (Fig. 8 D). In the presence of 25 mmol/L glucose (Fig. 8 E), uric acid production was enhanced by Gck overexpression and attenuated by Gckr overexpression, consistent with an effect of the Gck-to-Gckr ratio on cell Pi homeostasis.

Conclusions

Searching for the cause of type 2 diabetes has been a prime area of research since Etienne Lancereaux described fat diabetes (diabetes gras) in 1880. Though more studies are needed, the evidence that fructose-induced hyperuricemia may have a contributory role is gaining ground. While it still remains a hypothesis, increasing evidence suggests uric acid may have a fundamental role in the manifestations of metabolic syndrome (Fig. 3). Given that hyperuricemia is a remediable risk factor, we recommend both basic and clinical studies to address this important possibility.

Uric acid: potential mechanisms for insulin resistance and diabetes. Uric acid may contribute to insulin resistance in the liver by inducing mitochondrial oxidative stress and steatosis. Uric acid also blocks the ability of insulin to stimulate vasodilation of blood vessels, which is important for the delivery of glucose to the skeletal muscle. Uric acid also induces local inflammation in the adipose tissue with a reduction in the production of adiponectin. Finally, uric acid may also have direct effects on the islet cells leading to local oxidative stress and islet dysfunction. Mt, mitochondria; PO4, phosphate.

### Fructose: pure, white, and deadly? Fructose, by any other name, is a health hazard [^114BdxDi]. Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology (2010). Low credibility.

The worldwide consumption of sucrose, and thus fructose, has risen logarithmically since 1800. Many concerns about the health hazards of calorie-sweetened beverages, including soft drinks and fruit drinks and the fructose they provide, have been voiced over the past 10 years. These concerns are related to higher energy intake, risk of obesity, risk of diabetes, risk of cardiovascular disease, risk of gout in men, and risk of metabolic syndrome. Fructose appears to be responsible for most of the metabolic risks, including high production of lipids, increased thermogenesis, and higher blood pressure associated with sugar or high fructose corn syrup. Some claim that sugar is natural, but natural does not assure safety.

DISCUSSION

We find that mitochondrial metabolism – specifically, the ability to engage in OXPHOS – dictates the pathway by which cells maintain pools of purines. ETC-deficient cells exhibit suppressed de novo purine synthesis and require purine uptake and salvage to maximize growth (Figure 7J). We observed alterations in purine metabolites in fibroblasts from patients with mitochondrial dysfunction, and in human NSCLCs where the contribution of glucose to the TCA cycle correlates inversely with markers of purine salvage. We also note that patients with cancer receiving IACS-010759 in a Phase I clinical trial exhibited elevated purine nucIeotides in the blood, and that defects in mitochondrial DNA replication perturb purine-related metabolites in patients and mice. These findings provide support for the disease relevance of our study.

Aspartate is required for the synthesis of SAICAR, a pivotal step in de novo IMP synthesis, and becomes limiting when the cell's ability to recycle NADH to NAD + is impaired. Therefore, the suppression of de novo purine synthesis by ETC blockade is intuitively understandable. However, merely restoring intracellular aspartate is insufficient to restore de novo purine nucleotide synthesis in ETC-deficient cells, indicating the involvement of other factors in suppressing de novo purine synthesis under these conditions. For example, ETC dysfunction also disrupts one-carbon metabolism which provides N 10 -formyl-tetrahydrofolate for de novo purine synthesis pathway.

An intriguing aspect of the data is that ETC inhibition not only results in a switch from de novo purine synthesis to purine salvage to maintain purine monophosphate pools, but also expands these pools. We speculate that accumulation of purine monophosphates is an adaptive response to help cells cope with compromised ETC function. De novo purine nucleotide synthesis from PRPP to IMP is energetically demanding, requiring contributions from glutamine, glycine, aspartate, and N 10 -formyl-tetrahydrofolate, and is subject to feedback inhibition by purine monophosphates. Constitutive de novo purine synthesis would be counterproductive and perhaps toxic when the cell's ability to produce and maintain a favorable energy state and pools of required intermediates is insufficient to complete the pathway. The accumulated purine monophosphates may facilitate inhibition of PPAT, which catalyzes the committed step of the de novo pathway, therefore preventing unnecessary energy expenditure.

### Uric acid improves glucose-driven oxidative stress in human ischemic stroke [^112Smq6K]. Annals of Neurology (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

A study was undertaken to test in a subgroup reanalysis of the URICO-ICTUS trial whether uric acid is superior to placebo in improving the functional outcome in patients with acute stroke and hyperglycemia.

Methods

Patients were part of the URICO-ICTUS trial, a double-blind study that compared the administration of uric acid versus placebo in stroke patients treated with alteplase within 4.5 hours of onset. The effect of therapy on the rate of excellent outcome at 90 days (modified Rankin Scale ≤ 2) in each tertile of admission glucose was assessed with multivariate adjusted models in 409 of the 421 randomized patients who had available pretreatment glucose levels. The effect of therapy on infarct growth was assessed in 72 patients who had longitudinal multimodal brain imaging.

Results

Uric acid was associated with an increased rate of excellent outcome in patients with glucose levels in the upper tertile range (odds ratio [OR] = 2.9, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.0–8.3). However, the effect was not apparent for patients in the middle tertile (OR = 1.6, 95% CI = 0.8–3.6) or lower tertile of glucose (OR = 1.1, 95% CI = 0.5–2.6). Uric acid therapy was more effective than placebo in limiting infarct growth in the upper tertile range (Mann-Whitney U test, p = 0.04) but not in the middle tertile (p = 0.95) or lower tertile of glucose (p = 0.30). Uric acid also proved superior to placebo in reducing infarct growth in patients with early recanalization.

Interpretation

Uric acid therapy was associated with reduced infarct growth and improved outcome in patients with hyperglycemia during acute stroke.

### Fructose induces transketolase flux to promote pancreatic cancer growth [^1168YfNQ]. Cancer Research (2010). Low credibility.

Carbohydrate metabolism via glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid cycle is pivotal for cancer growth, and increased refined carbohydrate consumption adversely affects cancer survival. Traditionally, glucose and fructose have been considered as interchangeable monosaccharide substrates that are similarly metabolized, and little attention has been given to sugars other than glucose. However, fructose intake has increased dramatically in recent decades and cellular uptake of glucose and fructose uses distinct transporters. Here, we report that fructose provides an alternative substrate to induce pancreatic cancer cell proliferation. Importantly, fructose and glucose metabolism are quite different; in comparison with glucose, fructose induces thiamine-dependent transketolase flux and is preferentially metabolized via the nonoxidative pentose phosphate pathway to synthesize nucleic acids and increase uric acid production. These findings show that cancer cells can readily metabolize fructose to increase proliferation. They have major significance for cancer patients given dietary refined fructose consumption, and indicate that efforts to reduce refined fructose intake or inhibit fructose-mediated actions may disrupt cancer growth.

### World congress on insulin resistance, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease: part 1 [^114sBtVB]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Richard Johnson (Denver, CO) presented evidence of a relationship of fructose and uric acid to the pathogenesis of diabetes and obesity. He recalled the thrifty gene hypothesis that evolutionary adaptations to lack of nutrient availability underlie many of our metabolic characteristics and noted that the increase in sugar intake over the past several centuries leads to adaptations with desirable effects under circumstances of famine to engender the development of illness. Sucrose is a disaccharide of glucose and fructose, and high fructose corn syrup is a mixture of 55% fructose and 45% glucose. Fructose itself appears naturally in foods such as honey, and fructose availability is increasing in our modern environment of low physical activity, high energy intake, and obesity. The specific mechanisms by which fructose causes adverse effects relate to its unique metabolism, with a specific transporter and with fructokinase, which catalyzes the phosphorylation of fructose to fructose-1-phosphate (F1P), not being product regulated, which potentially leads to transient ATP depletion.

### Purine nucleotide depletion prompts cell migration by stimulating the serine synthesis pathway [^1114bFj9]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Purine nucleotides are necessary for various biological processes related to cell proliferation. Despite their importance in DNA and RNA synthesis, cellular signaling, and energy-dependent reactions, the impact of changes in cellular purine levels on cell physiology remains poorly understood. Here, we find that purine depletion stimulates cell migration, despite effective reduction in cell proliferation. Blocking purine synthesis triggers a shunt of glycolytic carbon into the serine synthesis pathway, which is required for the induction of cell migration upon purine depletion. The stimulation of cell migration upon a reduction in intracellular purines required one-carbon metabolism downstream of de novo serine synthesis. Decreased purine abundance and the subsequent increase in serine synthesis triggers an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and, in cancer models, promotes metastatic colonization. Thus, reducing the available pool of intracellular purines re-routes metabolic flux from glycolysis into de novo serine synthesis, a metabolic change that stimulates a program of cell migration.

### Serum uric acid and 1-h postload glucose in essential hypertension [^117K6NAU]. Diabetes Care (2012). Low credibility.

Another clinical question supported by our data is that NGT ≥ 155 subjects progress toward new diabetes, as recently demonstrated by others. This is an open question, because only 30–40% of subjects with IGT develop diabetes, whereas 40% of subjects who develop new diabetes are NGT at baseline, and our data contribute to explain the underlying mechanism. All these emphasize the importance of precociously identifying subjects at high risk for diabetes in order to offer them an intervention program that will prevent or slow their progression to overt diabetes. In keeping with this and on the basis of the strong relationship between UA and 1-h postload plasma glucose, it is plausible to hypothesize that simply measuring the UA concentration may also be considered a good predictor for future diabetes in NGT subjects. Baseline and postchallenge glucose and insulin concentrations seem to justify the biologic importance of global metabolic abnormalities and UA specifically. Thus, it should be useful in clinical practice to also routinely use the UA evaluation given that even nonelevated levels can be useful in identifying hypertensive people who are at risk for insulin resistance and diabetes. In fact, up to 50% of people with essential hypertension have insulin resistance, and this is one way to look for it without the need for an OGTT. In addition, the UA assessment is easy to determine and is less expensive.

### Sugar, uric acid, and the etiology of diabetes and obesity [^114U6uQX]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

FIG. 1.
Fructose-induced nucleotide turnover. Fructose is rapidly phosphorylated in the hepatocyte by KHK to fructose-1-phosphate (F-1-P), which uses ATP as a phosphate donor. Intracellular phosphate (PO4) levels decrease, stimulating the activity of AMP deaminase 2 (AMPD2). AMPD2 converts AMP to inosine monophosphate (IMP). IMP is metabolized to inosine by 5′ nucleotidase (5′NT), which is further degraded to xanthine and hypoxanthine by xanthine oxidase (XO), ultimately generating uric acid.

Recent studies suggest that this "side event" in fructose metabolism may be critical for how fructose induces metabolic syndrome. First, there are actually two KHK isoforms, and they differ in their ability to activate this pathway. KHK-C phosphorylates fructose rapidly, consuming ATP with the generation of uric acid. In contrast, KHK-A phosphorylates fructose slowly and consumes minimal ATP. When both KHK-C and KHK-A are deleted, mice are fully protected from fructose-induced metabolic syndrome and fatty liver; however, when KHK-A is selectively deleted, there is increased fructose available for metabolism by KHK-C, and the metabolic syndrome and fatty liver are worsened compared with wild-type mice despite the same intake of total calories and fructose. These studies suggest that differences in nucleotide turnover might influence the metabolic response.

### Inborn errors of pyrimidine metabolism: clinical update and therapy [^117E8JwT]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2014). Low credibility.

Inborn errors involving enzymes essential for pyrimidine nucleotide metabolism have provided new insights into their fundamental physiological roles as vital constituents of nucleic acids as well as substrates of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism and in oxidative phosphorylation. Genetic aberrations of pyrimidine pathways lead to diverse clinical manifestations including neurological, immunological, haematological, renal impairments, adverse reactions to analogue therapy and association with malignancies. Maintenance of cellular nucleotides depends on the three aspects of metabolism of pyrimidines: de novo synthesis, catabolism and recycling of these metabolites. Of the ten recognised disorders of pyrimidine metabolism treatment is currently restricted to only two disorders: hereditary orotic aciduria (oral uridine therapy) and mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE; allogeneic hematopoetic stem cell transplant and enzyme replacement). The ubiquitous role that pyrimidine metabolism plays in human life highlights the importance of improving diagnostic evaluation in suggestive clinical settings, which will contribute to the elucidation of new defects, future development of novel drugs and therapeutic strategies. Limited awareness of the expanding phenotypic spectrum, with relatively recent descriptions of newer disorders, compounded by considerable genetic heterogeneity has often contributed to the delays in the diagnosis of this group of disorders. The lack of an easily recognisable, easily measurable end product, akin to uric acid in purine metabolism, has contributed to the under-recognition of these disorders. This review describes the currently known inborn errors of pyrimidine metabolism, their variable phenotypic presentations, established diagnostic methodology and recognised treatment options.

### Could Alzheimer's disease be a maladaptation of an evolutionary survival pathway mediated by intracerebral fructose and uric acid metabolism? [^113aY6YV]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2023). Medium credibility.

An important aspect of survival is to assure enough food, water, and oxygen. Here, we describe a recently discovered response that favors survival in times of scarcity, and it is initiated by either ingestion or production of fructose. Unlike glucose, which is a source for immediate energy needs, fructose metabolism results in an orchestrated response to encourage food and water intake, reduce resting metabolism, stimulate fat and glycogen accumulation, and induce insulin resistance as a means to reduce metabolism and preserve glucose supply for the brain. How this survival mechanism affects brain metabolism, which in a resting human amounts to 20% of the overall energy demand, is only beginning to be understood. Here, we review and extend a previous hypothesis that this survival mechanism has a major role in the development of Alzheimer's disease and may account for many of the early features, including cerebral glucose hypometabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. We propose that the pathway can be engaged in multiple ways, including diets high in sugar, high glycemic carbohydrates, and salt. In summary, we propose that Alzheimer's disease may be the consequence of a maladaptation to an evolutionary-based survival pathway and what had served to enhance survival acutely becomes injurious when engaged for extensive periods. Although more studies are needed on the role of fructose metabolism and its metabolite, uric acid, in Alzheimer's disease, we suggest that both dietary and pharmacologic trials to reduce fructose exposure or block fructose metabolism should be performed to determine whether there is potential benefit in the prevention, management, or treatment of this disease.

### Sugar, uric acid, and the etiology of diabetes and obesity [^112cWPpi]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

The intake of added sugars, such as from table sugar (sucrose) and high-fructose corn syrup has increased dramatically in the last hundred years and correlates closely with the rise in obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. Fructose is a major component of added sugars and is distinct from other sugars in its ability to cause intracellular ATP depletion, nucleotide turnover, and the generation of uric acid. In this article, we revisit the hypothesis that it is this unique aspect of fructose metabolism that accounts for why fructose intake increases the risk for metabolic syndrome. Recent studies show that fructose-induced uric acid generation causes mitochondrial oxidative stress that stimulates fat accumulation independent of excessive caloric intake. These studies challenge the long-standing dogma that "a calorie is just a calorie" and suggest that the metabolic effects of food may matter as much as its energy content. The discovery that fructose-mediated generation of uric acid may have a causal role in diabetes and obesity provides new insights into pathogenesis and therapies for this important disease.

### Coordinated metabolic transitions during drosophila embryogenesis and the onset of aerobic glycolysis [^115xtisk]. G3 (2014). Low credibility.

Uric acid production is associated with oxidative stress

The finding that uric acid accumulates to high levels in late-stage embryos supports a model in which embryonic metabolism is adapted to oxidative stress. Uric acid is an end product of purine nucleotide degradation and is normally produced when there is either an abundance of free nucleotides or a disruption of other central metabolic pathways. Elevated uric acid production in humans is commonly associated with disorders in which oxidative metabolism is disrupted, such as cardiac failure, acute stroke, sleep apnea, and the onset of type 2 diabetes.

Uric acid production in Drosophila, however, not only results from high levels of purine catabolism but also reflects the disposal of nitrogenous waste from amino acid–derived energy production. In this context, the significant depletion of aspartate during embryogenesis is likely linked to the increase in uric acid. Aspartate is one of the three amino acids required for synthesizing purines, and the maternal loading of this amino acid could provide abundant precursor material for nucleotide synthesis. Although the production of ATP during the conversion of amino acid–derived purines into uric acid is rather inefficient, it provides distinct advantages to the developing embryo. Uric acid is highly insoluble and readily forms crystals, which have been observed previously in the developing Malpighian tubules. Because embryos are isolated from the external environment, uric acid crystal formation allows for the internal disposal of nitrogenous waste. Furthermore, uric acid is a powerful antioxidant and could protect developing embryos from oxidative stress. Mutants for the Drosophila xanthine dehydrogenase homolog, which eliminate uric acid production, are sensitive to oxidative stress.

Interestingly, uric acid synthesis not only is linked with defects in oxidative metabolism but also is associated with tumor metabolism. Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is a life-threatening and unpredictable event that results from tumors producing dangerously high levels of uric acid. Although the cause remains unclear, TLS often occurs after the administration of chemotherapy, suggesting that uric acid production is a result of metabolic stress. Drosophila embryogenesis, therefore, not only provides a unique opportunity to explore the metabolic state that drives uric acid synthesis but also may also provide valuable insights into why stressed tumors produce high levels of uric acid and how this dangerous syndrome might be avoided.

### Sugar-induced obesity and insulin resistance are uncoupled from shortened survival in drosophila [^1162gbQ4]. Cell Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

High-sugar diets cause thirst, obesity, and metabolic dysregulation, leading to diseases including type 2 diabetes and shortened lifespan. However, the impact of obesity and water imbalance on health and survival is complex and difficult to disentangle. Here, we show that high sugar induces dehydration in adult Drosophila, and water supplementation fully rescues their lifespan. Conversely, the metabolic defects are water-independent, showing uncoupling between sugar-induced obesity and insulin resistance with reduced survival in vivo. High-sugar diets promote accumulation of uric acid, an end-product of purine catabolism, and the formation of renal stones, a process aggravated by dehydration and physiological acidification. Importantly, regulating uric acid production impacts on lifespan in a water-dependent manner. Furthermore, metabolomics analysis in a human cohort reveals that dietary sugar intake strongly predicts circulating purine levels. Our model explains the pathophysiology of high-sugar diets independently of obesity and insulin resistance and highlights purine metabolism as a pro-longevity target.

### Sex-specific association of the putative fructose transporter SLC2A9 variants with uric acid levels is modified by BMI [^116skcpo]. Diabetes Care (2008). Low credibility.

In humans, uric acid is the end product of purine metabolism, and hyperuricemia might be caused by an overproduction of or by disturbances in the elimination of uric acid. Although some experimental evidence supports the idea of a beneficial role of uric acid because of its strong antioxidative properties, a number of epidemiological studies reported an association between high uric acid levels and cardiovascular disease, hypertension, kidney disease, metabolic syndrome, and even total mortality. Uric acid levels are, furthermore, positively associated with serum glucose in healthy subjects, and subjects with higher uric acid levels have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome. However, the mechanisms underlying this association are still unclear.

The regulation of uric acid levels is under strong genetic control, with heritability estimates ranging from 25 to70%. The elucidation of the genetic contributors to uric acid levels as an intermediate phenotype for various diseases might shed some light on the pathogenesis of these complex phenotypes and might help identify new targets for treating undesirably high uric acid levels.

Recent genome-wide association studies identified a strong association of uric acid levels with genetic variants within SLC2A9, a gene located in the chromosomal region 4p16.1 encoding a putative fructose transporter. There is strong evidence from both animal models and human studies supporting fructose as a highly lipogenic nutrient that contributes to tissue insulin insensitivity, metabolic disturbances, and the development of a prediabetic state when consumed in high quantities.

In the present study we aimed to replicate the recently discovered association between genetic variation within the SLC2A9 gene and uric acid concentrations in the population-based Bruneck Study. This analysis was extended by a large case-control study of severely obese individuals from Utah who showed increased uric acid levels compared with those in control subjects to explore whether the genetic association is modified by obesity.

### Sugar-induced obesity and insulin resistance are uncoupled from shortened survival in drosophila [^114NfGHe]. Cell Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Here, we show that water imbalance plays an important role in mediating the pathology of both high-sugar and high-purine diets. Water is vital for all living systems, yet its importance is often overlooked in biological studies. For example, dehydration stress induces innate immunity in Drosophila through steroid signaling in the renal tubules. Water dysregulation is also relevant in the context of metabolic disease. For instance, thirst is an early symptom of T2D, and low water intake is a predictor of hyperglycemia. Hydration status is also known to affect kidney function and plasma uric acid levels in humans, and the geographical distribution of kidney stone prevalence is higher in hotter climates associated with dehydration. Consistent with our findings in Drosophila, human epidemiological studies show positive effects of fluid intake on decreasing the risk of kidney stone formation. Uric acid concentrations above ∼6–7 mg/dL are prone to crystallization, which, interestingly, is equivalent to the ∼70 ng/μL detected in the hemolymph of flies fed the high-sugar diet, showing that the levels are surprisingly well controlled and suggesting an evolutionarily conserved biochemical mechanism between distant organisms.

The XO inhibitor AP is widely prescribed to patients for the treatment of conditions associated with uric acid accumulation, including gout and kidney stones. In our study, we adopted a pharmacological approach to prevent uric acid formation by treating flies with AP. Importantly, despite AP treatment successfully clearing the tubules of uric acid stones, the accumulation of upstream metabolites in the purine degradation pathway was itself pathophysiological. Xanthine and hypoxanthine are also biochemically prone to form crystals, as we observed in the rectal ampulla, which may explain the incomplete rescue of survival upon AP treatment in our experiments. Consistent with our findings, genetic disruption of purine catabolism is detrimental: null mutants for XO, encoded by the rosy (ry) gene in Drosophila, develop xanthine tubule stones and are short-lived. Therefore, although AP provided a partial rescue of the high-sugar-induced uric-acid-associated mortality, the blockage of purine catabolism was metabolically disruptive and ultimately detrimental to survival, suggesting a need for novel therapies and approaches, which could be tested for rescue of survival with the Drosophila model system.

### Maternal and umbilical cord plasma purine concentrations after oral carbohydrate loading prior to elective cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia: a randomized controlled trial [^114LK9cw]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

With metabolic stress and decreased delivery of glucose, mitochondrial dysfunction during pregnancy and delivery may disrupt the purinergic pathway of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) cycle. Purine bases and nucleosides are the end-products of cellular conversion in tissues and can be utilized by various cells of the body, including erythrocytes, hepatic and kidney cells, or muscles. This occurs within the purine conversion pathways and influences the cellular energy status. However, when tissue metabolic needs exceed glucose delivery to cells, degradation of ATP occurs, with the production of a series of intermediate products: ATP → ADP (adenosine diphosphate) → AMP (adenosine monophosphate) → adenosine → inosine → hypoxanthine → xanthine → uric acid → excretion of uric acid with urine.

In addition, a shift from the utilization of glucose to the utilization of fat may occur during periods of fasting. Prolonged fasting leads to a shift from carbohydrates to fat as the primary energy source, resulting in the production of ketones such as beta-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB). Beta-hydroxybutyrate serves as an alternative energy source for extrahepatic tissues, such as the brain, heart, and skeletal muscles, when glucose is limited, such as during starvation with hyperketonaemia as a side effect in many patients. According to Bellwood et al. if starvation duration is limited by oral carbohydrate use to under 4 h, then the incidence of ketonuria is 10%.

### Umami-induced obesity and metabolic syndrome is mediated by nucleotide degradation and uric acid generation [^115HMEsh]. Nature Metabolism (2021). High credibility.

Umami refers to the savoury taste that is mediated by monosodium glutamate (MSG) and enhanced by inosine monophosphate and other nucleotides. Umami foods have been suggested to increase the risk for obesity and metabolic syndrome but the mechanism is not understood. Here we show that MSG induces obesity, hypothalamic inflammation and central leptin resistance in male mice through the induction of AMP deaminase 2 and purine degradation. Mice lacking AMP deaminase 2 in both hepatocytes and neurons are protected from MSG-induced metabolic syndrome. This protection can be overcome by supplementation with inosine monophosphate, most probably owing to its degradation to uric acid as the effect can be blocked with allopurinol. Thus, umami foods induce obesity and metabolic syndrome by engaging the same purine nucleotide degradation pathway that is also activated by fructose and salt consumption. We suggest that the three tastes-sweet, salt and umami-developed to encourage food intake to facilitate energy storage and survival but drive obesity and diabetes in the setting of excess intake through similar mechanisms.

(E) Biochemical pathway showing how dietary sugars such as-glucose and-fructose can lead to enhanced purine metabolism and to the formation of uric acid. Following the action of enzymes such as hexokinase, adenosine monophosphate (AMP) is formed and can be converted to the purine precursor inosine monophosphate (IMP). Alternatively, the purine precursor ribose-5-P is formed via the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) by de novo biosynthesis. The drug allopurinol (AP) prevents uric acid production by inhibiting the enzyme xanthine oxidase (XO)/xanthine dehydrogenase (XDH). Urate oxidase (Uro) catalyzes the degradation of uric acid to allantoin. The enzyme XO/XDH (encoded by rosy in Drosophila) and Uro are strongly expressed in the tubules (> 20-fold and > 13,000-fold higher than in the hindgut of females, respectively;).

### Are heterozygous carriers for hereditary fructose intolerance predisposed to metabolic disturbances when exposed to fructose? [^113REB1b]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Background

High fructose intake causes hepatic insulin resistance and increases postprandial blood glucose, lactate, triglyceride, and uric acid concentrations. Uric acid may contribute to insulin resistance and dyslipidemia in the general population. In patients with hereditary fructose intolerance, fructose consumption is associated with acute hypoglycemia, renal tubular acidosis, and hyperuricemia.

Objective

We investigated whether asymptomatic carriers for hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) would have a higher sensitivity to adverse effects of fructose than would the general population.

Design

Eight subjects heterozygous for HFI (hHFI; 4 men, 4 women) and 8 control subjects received a low-fructose diet for 7 d and on the eighth day ingested a test meal, calculated to provide 25% of the basal energy requirement, containing 13C-labeled fructose (0.35 g/kg), glucose (0.35 g/kg), protein (0.21 g/kg), and lipid (0.22 g/kg). Glucose rate of appearance (GRa, calculated with [6,6–2H2]glucose), fructose, net carbohydrate, and lipid oxidation, and plasma triglyceride, uric acid, and lactate concentrations were monitored over 6 h postprandially.

Results

Postprandial GRa, fructose, net carbohydrate, and lipid oxidation, and plasma lactate and triglyceride concentrations were not significantly different between the 2 groups. Postprandial plasma uric acid increased by 7.2% compared with fasting values in hHFI subjects (P < 0.01), but not in control subjects (-1.1%, ns).

Conclusions

Heterozygous carriers of hereditary fructose intolerance had no significant alteration of postprandial fructose metabolism compared with control subjects. They did, however, show a postprandial increase in plasma uric acid concentration that was not observed in control subjects in responses to ingestion of a modest amount of fructose. This trial was registered at the US Clinical Trials Registry as NCT02979106.

### Insights into SGLT2 inhibitor treatment of diabetic cardiomyopathy: focus on the mechanisms [^114BbauY]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2023). Medium credibility.

Hyperuricaemia is another independent risk factor for diabetes. Uric acid levels increase in the early stages of impaired glucose metabolism, and hyperuricaemia is associated with micro- and macrovascular complications of diabetes. Uric acid concentrations higher than physiological levels inhibit NO synthesis, reduce NO activity and induce NF-κB, leading to the induction of monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), which mediate inflammation and atherosclerosis. Chino et al. found that the SGLT2i luseogliflozin increased uric acid excretion and that GLUT9 isoform 2 was involved. SGLT2i increased the concentration of glucose in the proximal tubule, which caused GLUT9 isoform 2 and other transporters to reabsorb more glucose and excrete more uric acid. In the collecting ducts, a high concentration of glucose prevents GLUT9 isoform 2 from reabsorbing uric acid (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2
SGLT2i can improve vasodilatory inflammation by decreasing uric acid levels. In proximal renal tubules, SGLT2i acts on SGLT2, decreasing the reabsorption of Na ions and glucose and increasing glucose concentrations in the lumen, which is exchanged with uric acid by GLUT9 isoform 2. This leads to increased uric acid exclusion. In the collecting duct, high levels of glucose inhibit this exchange and reduce the absorption of uric acid, thereby draining it. Lowering the concentration of uric acid in the blood helps reduce inflammation in the blood vessels

### Maternal and umbilical cord plasma purine concentrations after oral carbohydrate loading prior to elective cesarean delivery under spinal anesthesia: a randomized controlled trial [^111Mmv3J]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The results of this secondary biochemical analysis of a prospective randomized controlled trial showed that concentrations of hypoxanthine and xanthine in the mother's blood plasma and umbilical cord blood plasma in patients supplemented with carbohydrates were significantly lower compared to patients without carbohydrate supplementation undergoing spinal anesthesia for elective cesarean delivery, with no differences between the level of uric acid between the two groups. These results suggest a clinically important relationship between CHO and maternal and neonatal ATP metabolism and the purinergic pathway. What is important to emphasize is that during metabolic stress (i.e. fasting) with limited glucose access, tissues, and cells utilize a pathway alternative to ATP formation through ADP phosphorylation. In such an event ATP undergoes a different process - degradation in the purinergic pathway with the formation of hypoxanthine and xanthine and later conversion to uric acid. Lower levels of intermediate products (hypoxanthine and xanthine) in the group provided a preoperative CHO suggesting that preoperative glucose delivery limits metabolic stress and is associated with a favorable biochemical response.

Significant positive correlations were observed in the group of patients who received carbohydrate loading (CHO) prior to elective cesarean delivery. In maternal plasma, these included correlations between uric acid and xanthine, uric acid and β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB), hypoxanthine and xanthine, xanthine and β-HB, and lactate and β-HB.

The authors are unaware of any prior studies comparing CHO loading to no CHO loading in patients undergoing elective cesarean delivery, with maternal and neonatal assessment for purinergic pathway metabolites. Some studies are reporting metabolic data in this aspect of research, including a study by Calderon et al. who compared the effect of modes of delivery on purines and malondialdehyde concentration in the plasma of blood drawn from the umbilical artery of healthy newborns born at term, demonstrating that vaginal delivery was associated with higher hypoxanthine and xanthine concentration than elective cesarean delivery. The authors hypothesize that reduction of placental and umbilical flow during uterine contractions, especially when augmented with oxytocin infusion, decreases the blood flow between the mother and her fetus which may preferentially induce the ATP breakdown pathway with increased levels of xanthine and hypoxanthine. However, no direct correlation was demonstrated between purine levels and negative clinical outcomes. Although our study examined the purine pathway in the context of maternal and neonatal metabolism, it does not provide evidence for a direct effect of metabolic changes with CHO or SF on neonatal clinical outcomes.

### Serum uric acid as a new player in the development of diabetic nephropathy [^116Uvt6W]. Journal of Renal Nutrition (2011). Low credibility.

The pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy is complex and still not fully elucidated. Uric acid has been associated with renal disease, even though hyperuricemia may be a marker of or by itself be responsible for microvascular disease in diabetes. In animal models, elevated level of uric acid can lead to arteriolopathy of preglomerular vessels, impaired autoregulation, glomerular hypertension, as well as endothelial dysfunction. Kidney damage in hyperuricemic rats is not dependent on blood pressure, and instead involves the renin-angiotensin system. In patients with diabetes, serum uric acid early in the course of diabetes is significantly, and independent of confounders, associated with later development of persistent macroalbuminuria. Therefore, uric acid may be a novel and important player in the pathogenesis of microvascular complications in diabetes. A dose-response relationship between serum uric acid and early decline in renal function has recently been demonstrated in patients with type-1 diabetes. Randomized controlled trials on drugs that lower uric acid need to be conducted to evaluate the causal relationship between serum uric acid and development and progression of diabetic kidney disease; in addition, large scale long-term treatment trials need to be performed, as they are still lacking.

### Uric acid as a danger signal in gout and its comorbidities [^116WaeCD]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2013). Medium credibility.

Uric acid is a waste product of purine catabolism. This molecule comes to clinical attention when it nucleates to form crystals of monosodium urate (MSU) in joints or other tissues, and thereby causes the inflammatory disease of gout. Patients with gout frequently suffer from a number of comorbid conditions including hypertension, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. Why MSU crystals trigger inflammation and are associated with comorbidities of gout has been unclear, but recent studies provide new insights into these issues. Rather than simply being a waste product, uric acid could serve a pathophysiological role as a local alarm signal that alerts the immune system to cell injury and helps to trigger both innate and adaptive immune responses. The inflammatory component of these immune responses is caused when urate crystals trigger both inflammasome-dependent and independent pathways to generate the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1. The resulting bioactive IL-1 stimulates the inflammation of gout and might contribute to the development of other comorbidities. Surprisingly, the same mechanisms underlie the inflammatory response to a number of irritant particles, many of which also cause disease. These new insights help to explain the pathogenesis of gout and point to potential new therapeutic targets for this and other sterile inflammatory diseases.

### Association between serum uric acid to creatinine ratio with metabolic profile in subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) [^114xoabN]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Fig. 3
Mechanistic pathways underlying the association between elevated serum uric acid to creatinine ratio in NAFLD progression

In the present study, fasting insulin concentrations decreased across higher tertiles of SUA/Cr, whereas no significant differences were observed in HOMA-IR. These findings suggest that although SUA/Cr has been proposed as a surrogate marker of metabolic dysfunction, its relationship with insulin resistance may not be straightforward in all populations. One possible explanation is that SUA/Cr reflects the interplay between uric acid production and renal clearance rather than directly mirroring insulin resistance status. Despite our null findings for HOMA-IR, growing evidence supports a link between SUA/Cr and glucose dysregulation. Kuwabara et al. reported that higher SUA/Cr was significantly associated with elevated HOMA-IR and increased risk of insulin resistance in a large Japanese cohort. Likewise, Liu et al. demonstrated that SUA was an independent predictor of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. At the mechanistic level, uric acid has been shown to interfere with insulin signaling pathways through oxidative stress, impaired endothelial nitric oxide bioavailability, and promotion of low-grade inflammation. Therefore, although our study did not reveal a significant association between SUA/Cr and HOMA-IR, the observed reduction in fasting insulin at higher SUA/Cr tertiles may reflect an early adaptive or compensatory response. Taken together, while our findings highlight the complexity of this association, the existing literature consistently supports the role of SUA/Cr as a potential contributor to insulin resistance and NAFLD progression.

### The effects of apples and apple juice on acute plasma uric acid concentration: a randomized controlled trial [^111LUJjj]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The consumption of large amounts of fructose from added sugars results in the hepatic production and export of uric acid into the circulation.

Objective

Our aim was to test whether fructose present in fruit is of sufficient quantity or in a form that will increase uric acid concentration.

Design

Seventy-three participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups to ingest small (205 g) and large (410 g) servings of apple segments, small (170 mL) and large (340 mL) servings of apple juice, or a glucose and a fructose control beverage. Within each group, participants ingested both treatments in a crossover design. The fructose control and the large servings of apple and juice contained 26.7 g fructose. Test foods were ingested within 10 min. Blood samples were taken at baseline and at 30 and 60 min after intake.

Results

Plasma uric acid concentrations increased after the intake of all fructose-containing treatments and decreased after the glucose beverage. The mean (95% CI) increase in uric acid at 30 min was 15 µmol/L (10, 21 µmol/L) for the fructose control and 19 µmol/L (8, 30 µmol/L) and 17 µmol/L (9, 24 µmol/L) for the large servings of apple and apple juice, respectively. There was no difference in change in uric acid between baseline and 30 min when comparing the apple (3 µmol/L; 95% CI: -8, 14 µmol/L) and apple juice (-7 µmol/L; 95% CI: -18, 5 µmol/L) with the fructose control. Blood pressure taken 70 min after ingestion was unaffected by any treatment (P > 0.05). There was no difference in change in satiety scores between the fructose and glucose control beverages (P > 0.05). Participants felt more satiated 30 min after ingesting whole apple than after apple juice. The glycemic response reflected the amount of glucose in each treatment.

Conclusions

The body acutely responds to fructose regardless of source. Longer-term studies are required to assess how small and transient increases in plasma uric acid contribute to health. This trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry at https://www.anzctr.org.au/trial/registration/trialreview.aspx?id = 367974 as ACTRN12615000215527.

### Purine metabolism and dystonia: perspectives of a long-promised relationship [^111UEmXh]. Annals of Neurology (2025). Medium credibility.

Bioenergetic and Mitochondrial Dyshomeostasis

Another pathological process that is involved in the genesis of dystonic movements is cellular energy deficiency. Based on clinico‐genetic observations in patients, in vitro studies, and animal models, pathways required for energy production and transfer in the brain are often compromised in dystonic syndromes. Both purine de novo synthesis and purine salvage are closely connected to cellular energetic states and mitochondrial function. Purines and their downstream signals are crucial to sustain the orchestration of energy homeostasis that is required for neuronal activity and associated astrocytic responses.

In situations where the de novo and salvage pathways become discoordinated, cells may experience higher energy demands to maintain purine pools that are essential to meet the requirements for normal function. Such shifts in pathway utilization would be the expected outcome of several purine‐pathway enzyme defects resulting in PMDs, including LND and, potentially, IMPDH2 ‐related dystonia caused by gain‐of‐function mutations (see Fig 2). Mechanistically, imbalances driving purine de novo synthesis to become more active would lead to an enhanced activation of biochemical pathways that depend on glucose concentrations. Direct experimental confirmation for disturbances in glucose metabolism as a result of greater reliance on the de novo synthetic pathway in PMDs comes from studies of neural cells derived from patients with LND. Bell and colleaguesperformed real‐time glucose tracing to reveal that HGprt deficiency causes an increased shunt of glucose to the pentose phosphate pathway, which is required to maximize the efficiency of purine de novo synthesis. This, in turn, resulted in reduced availability of glucose for glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation, culminating in a negative impact on ATP production. When assessing cell type‐specific consequences of the glucose shunting, the authors observed that energy defects were most evident in dopamine neurons, whereas some cortical cells were less severely affected, highlighting pronounced vulnerability of a main dystonia‐relevant system. Similar alterations in energetic metabolism could be hypothesized for gain of IMPDH2 function, although the associated disease pathophysiology at the cellular level still remains largely elusive.

### Physiological serum uric acid concentrations correlate with arterial stiffness in a sex-dependent manner [^1157nDzA]. BMC Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

In humans, uric acid is the end product of purine metabolism (metabolism of DNA, RNA, or nucleotides) that requires renal excretion to maintain homeostasis. An increase in uric acid formation or impaired elimination can lead to gout and urolithiasis due to crystallization. Although it is a metabolic end product, physiological serum concentrations in the range of ~ 200 to ~ 400 µmol/l are maintained at steady state. The reason behind that is probably the blood pressure-increasing or -maintaining effect of uric acid, which represented an evolutionary advantage during the transition to terrestrial life when NaCl supply was critical. This effect is probably based on the vascular impact of uric acid, which can promote phenotypic changes of vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells, thereby leading to vascular remodeling and ultimately higher blood pressure. Recent studies demonstrate an increase in oxidative stress, a decrease in NO availability, activation of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system (RAAS), and vascular inflammatory processes as underlying molecular mechanisms.

Nowadays, NaCl supply is abundant and there is overconsumption, making this impact detrimental and contributing to vascular pathophysiology. Accordingly, several studies indicate that increased uric acid serum concentrations are associated with cardiovascular diseases and vascular end-organ damage. Thus, it is conceivable that uric acid promotes vascular dysfunction and vascular remodeling and thereby arterial hypertension. However, this hypothesis is unproven for humans, and it cannot be excluded that uric acid promotes primarily hypertension, thereby leading to vascular damage. In addition, pathophysiologically relevant uric acid concentration ranges as well as their sex differences are unclear.

Our present analyses show the positive association of serum uric acid concentrations with PWV, as a measure of vascular stiffness in a large and population-based cohort of the German adult population. This association was observed across the entire spectrum of serum urate levels and not restricted to individuals with hyperuricemia and persisted after correction for relevant confounders, including blood pressure, age, smoking, obesity, blood glucose, Hba1c, or cholesterol levels. Of note, the strength of the association was identical (same regression coefficient) in the entire sample and in the subsample with "normal" serum urate levels. The result of machine learning approach, performed as a proof of principle, confirmed the regression analysis and identified uric acid as independent variable associated with vascular stiffness. Of note, linear regression analysis resulted in negative regression coefficients for smoking related to PWV. This finding is surprising but highly significant and should be analyzed further in subsequent studies. However, it is important to note that the effect size is small.

### Assessment of the relationship between serum uric acid and glucose levels in healthy, prediabetic and diabetic individuals [^111MsmSa]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

It has been demonstrated that type 2 diabetes is associated with oxidative stress and increased free radical formation. Oxidative stress causes the reduction of the antioxidant levels in the body. This may explain the reduction of SUA in present investigation as SUA is considered as one of the total antioxidant compound present in the body. The inverse relationship observed in the present study between SUA and FBG may reflect the role of hyperglycemia in the genesis of oxidative stress in diabetic individuals. The main strength of the present study includes its population-based nature, the inclusion of healthy, prediabetic and diabetic individuals, and the availability of some useful data on potential confounders for multivariable adjustment. Furthermore, a rigorous methodology was followed during data collection. The major limitation of the study is the cross-sectional nature of the data which may preclude the findings regarding the temporal nature of the relationship between SUA and diabetes. Therefore, even though there were some independent traditional confounders such as age, BMI, TC and TG, but it was difficult to confirm the cause-effect relationship. Other limitations included, we did not have information on glycemic control (HbA1c) and levels of urinary uric acid of the prediabetic and diabetic individuals, and therefore our results indicate a hypothesis other than a conviction. Moreover, we did not collect information on antidiabetic medications. Taken into account the inconsistent findings in recent and previous studies, it is rather difficult to determine SUA levels as a risk factor for diabetes mellitus. However, present study findings are worthy as a reference for future research.

### Pathway for ascertaining the role of uric acid in neurodegenerative diseases [^112ANZnm]. Alzheimer's & Dementia (2022). Medium credibility.

Uric acid is the end product of purine metabolism. Elevated serum urate level, a condition known as hyperuricemia, is a cardiovascular disease risk factor. Low urate level, a condition known as hypouricemia, is a risk factor for developing neurodegenerative diseases. The upper normal uric acid levels could range between 6 and 6.8 mg/dL in healthy adults with normal kidney function. Maintaining normal urate levels provides significant antioxidant and neuroprotective effects. High urate levels above saturation threshold (6.8 mg/dL) are considered a pro‐inflammatory condition, leading to increased oxidative stress, increased renin–angiotensin levels, activated aldosterone system, increased systemic vascular resistance, and reduced renal blood flow, and consequently hypertension and worsening kidney function. Low serum urate levels are a risk factor for developing neurodegenerative diseases (Figure 1). Although the exact mechanism that uric acid exerts as a neuroprotective biochemical is not elucidated, it is believed that uric acid levels are scavengers of free radicals, superoxide, and hydrogen peroxide. Urate levels are responsible for 55% of free radicals' scavenging capacity in the human body. Thus, low uric acid levels could augment the risk of oxidative stress, increasing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species, which may permeate the effect of tau protein on neuro entanglement, leading to a decline in cognitive function and preclinical neurodegenerative diseases.

### Unraveling the complexities of diet induced obesity and glucolipid dysfunction in metabolic syndrome [^1113tBgU]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2025). Medium credibility.

Palmitic acid may be further elongated or desaturated (by SCD) to form a long chain or unsaturated fatty acids, namely stearic acid (C18) and oleic acid (C18:1, D 9) which are then esterified for conversion into endogenous TAGs. Small amounts of FFA enter into FAO pathways to generate ATP to be utilized by hepatocytes for energy purposes. The lipid storage capacity of the liver is minimal; so, the excess FFAs are re-esterified into TAGs, which are then packaged into VLDL and transported to adipose and other peripheral tissues. Minor amounts of cytosolic acetyl CoA are used for cholesterol biosynthesis (stimulated by ChREBP), which is then utilized to synthesize bile acids, vitamin D, and steroid hormones (either in the liver or other endocrine organs). After delivery of their TAGs in adipose tissue, the reminant chylomicrons reach the liver, where they are finally metabolized and broken down to FFA and glycerol, which can be utilized for TAG resynthesis. Chylomicron resident cholesterol can be used for the biosynthesis of bile acids, or excess cholesterol can be excreted via bile. With the addition of fructose or sucrose in the diet, fructose metabolism in the liver feeds into the glycolytic pathway via fructokinase action. Fructose metabolism also generates glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) which can continue into glycolysis or feeds into lipogenesis. Fructose-induced stimulation of carbohydrate response element (ChREBP) subsequently upregulates de novo lipogenesis (via SREBP induction and activation) producing fatty acids which are esterified into TAG synthesis and enhances cholesterol biosynthesis. Fructose metabolism can generate uric acid and advanced glycation end products such as methylglyoxal (in higher doses of fructose), which can directly inhibit AMPK thus reducing energy expenditure. Fructose metabolism-generated AGEs via their receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), disrupt mitochondrial functions, increasing the production of ROS production, which interact with RAGEs, and promote oxidative stress. Mitochondrial ROS and fructose (directly) interact with proteins undergoing molecular rearrangements, resulting in the formation of more AGEs, namely carboxymethyl-lysine (CML) and glyoxal-lysine dimer (GOLD) (via albumin binding). These AGEs inhibit SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) degradation, triggering unimpeded SREBP activity that induces lipogenesis.

### The protective role of serum uric acid against premature membrane rupture in gestational diabetes: a cross-sectional study [^115E1c3o]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

There was some strength in this study. Blood biochemical tests (including SUA) were collected from all subjects at 24–28th weeks of gestation to exclude the effects of differences in gestational weeks on the results. All the subjects were women because of pregnancy, and none of the subjects consumed alcohol. Consequently, possible SUA-influencing factors, such as sex and alcohol consumption, were excluded. Except for the factors that may affect glucose metabolism, there were no other recruitment restrictions, thus the study population should be a good representation. There are some limitations to this study. This was a single centre study, so the number of subjects was limited. The follow-up period was short; therefore we could make no conclusions on the long-term pregnancy outcomes. The related uric acid metabolism pathways also need further study.

### Endogenous fructose production and fructokinase activation mediate renal injury in diabetic nephropathy [^114DtDeB]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Diabetes is associated with activation of the polyol pathway, in which glucose is converted to sorbitol by aldose reductase. Previous studies focused on the role of sorbitol in mediating diabetic complications. However, in the proximal tubule, sorbitol can be converted to fructose, which is then metabolized largely by fructokinase, also known as ketohexokinase, leading to ATP depletion, proinflammatory cytokine expression, and oxidative stress. We and others recently identified a potential deleterious role of dietary fructose in the generation of tubulointerstitial injury and the acceleration of CKD. In this study, we investigated the potential role of endogenous fructose production, as opposed to dietary fructose, and its metabolism through fructokinase in the development of diabetic nephropathy. Wild-type mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes developed proteinuria, reduced GFR, and renal glomerular and proximal tubular injury. Increased renal expression of aldose reductase; elevated levels of renal sorbitol, fructose, and uric acid; and low levels of ATP confirmed activation of the fructokinase pathway. Furthermore, renal expression of inflammatory cytokines with macrophage infiltration was prominent. In contrast, diabetic fructokinase-deficient mice demonstrated significantly less proteinuria, renal dysfunction, renal injury, and inflammation. These studies identify fructokinase as a novel mediator of diabetic nephropathy and document a novel role for endogenous fructose production, or fructoneogenesis, in driving renal disease.

### Fructose production and metabolism in the kidney [^116q9yKJ]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Understanding fructose metabolism might provide insights to renal pathophysiology. To support systemic glucose concentration, the proximal tubular cells reabsorb fructose as a substrate for gluconeogenesis. However, in instances when fructose intake is excessive, fructose metabolism is costly, resulting in energy depletion, uric acid generation, inflammation, and fibrosis in the kidney. A recent scientific advance is the discovery that fructose can be endogenously produced from glucose under pathologic conditions, not only in kidney diseases, but also in diabetes, in cardiac hypertrophy, and with dehydration. Why humans have such a deleterious mechanism to produce fructose is unknown, but it may relate to an evolutionary benefit in the past. In this article, we aim to illuminate the roles of fructose as it relates to gluconeogenesis and fructoneogenesis in the kidney.

### Current updates and future perspectives in uric acid research, 2024 [^114mKchR]. Hypertension Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Uric acid, the final product of purine metabolism, plays a significant role in hypertension Research on uric acid has advanced significantly, particularly regarding its links to hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Our 2023 review covered the relationship between uric acid, hypertension; and CVD, however, numerous new studies have emerged since then. This paper provides an update, summarizing recent findings over the past two years on hyperuricemia and its association with hypertension, preeclampsia, arteriosclerosis, kidney disease, sleep-disordered breathing, CVD, and so on. Hyperuricemia, often driven by reduced uric acid excretion or increased production, is influenced by genetic factors and lifestyle habits, including high-purine foods, alcohol, and fructose intake. While hyperuricemia has been proposed to contribute to hypertension and CVD through mechanisms like inflammasome activation and oxidative stress, its causal role remains debated. Further clinical and basic science studies on hyperuricemia and purine metabolism are necessary to clarify its impact on CVD and guide therapeutic approaches.

### Assessment of the relationship between serum uric acid and glucose levels in healthy, prediabetic and diabetic individuals [^114YXqHX]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Uric acid in serum is the metabolic end product of the purine nucleotides, and it's over-production and decreased excretion through kidneys lead to hyperuricemia in humans. The prevalence of hyperuricemia in the general population is estimated at about 10–25%. In recent decades, the prevalence of hyperuricemia has increased substantially in the world with a rising trend both in the developed and developing nations. High concentration of uric acid in the blood can lead to gout and are associated with several medical conditions, including metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and renal dysfunction. In epidemiological studies, serum uric acid (SUA) has been shown as a risk factor for hypertension, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular and kidney diseases however, the putative association between SUA and diabetes is not clear and the findings are controversial, and there may be sex and ethnic differences in the relationships.

Previously, some studies reported a positive association between elevated SUA and diabetes, whereas, other studies reported no correlation, or an inverse relationship. In healthy individuals, SUA has been reported to be positively correlated with blood glucose. However, this association in non-diabetic healthy, prediabetic and diabetic individuals is not consistent. A meta-analysis reported an association between SUA and increased risk of development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). A prospective study indicated that diabetes is related to a lower risk of gout development in the UK general population and Chinese population. Other studies have shown a declining trend of SUA in the glycemic state and in some cases, there was no significant association between SUA and glycemic state. Most of the previous studies were conducted in the population group with existing co-morbid conditions such as old age, diabetes, and who were at high risk for kidney or cardiovascular disease. There are few studies that have evaluated the SUA levels and its relationship with blood glucose concentrations in apparently healthy adults. So, it is important to know the actual trend of SUA in healthy, prediabetic and diabetic individuals, as hyperuricemia is increasingly found to be associated with a number of modifiable risk factors contributing to cardiovascular diseases. Although there are some reports on the relationship between SUA and diabetes from different parts of the world, still there is a lack of such information for the Bangladeshi population. In this context, we aimed to assess the relationship between SUA and fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels in non-diabetic healthy, prediabetic and diabetic individuals in Bangladesh.

### Sugar, uric acid, and the etiology of diabetes and obesity [^1113ehUW]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

To examine the purine nucleotide pathway in the metabolic response, we silenced aldolase B in a hepatocyte line (HepG2 cells). Aldolase B is the second enzyme in fructose metabolism, and the genetic loss of aldolase B is the cause of hereditary fructose intolerance. When aldolase B is inhibited, fructose is phosphorylated by ATP but cannot be further metabolized, nevertheless fructose can be metabolized by other routes such as hexokinase. In this regard, subjects with hereditary fructose intolerance, are known to have hyperactive KHK and show enhanced ATP depletion and uric acid generation in response to fructose. As such, this is an interesting condition in which marked nucleotide turnover and ATP depletion occur but without the ability to be further metabolized by this primary enzymatic pathway to glucose, glycogen, or triglycerides. Nevertheless, the feeding of fructose to HepG2 cells lacking aldolase B resulted in a rapid accumulation of triglycerides, consistent with our findings that uric acid itself can induce triglyceride accumulation. These experiments explain why fatty liver and hyperuricemia are common complications of this disease and also why fatty liver and diabetes are complications in subjects with glycogen storage disease I, in which hepatic intracellular ATP depletion and hyperuricemia also occur. Finally, it provides an explanation for why fructose is lipogenic (based on acetate labeling studies) despite little of the fructose molecule being incorporated into the triglyceride molecule itself.

### Sugar, uric acid, and the etiology of diabetes and obesity [^114zWzU8]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Fructose-induced weight gain and metabolic syndrome

Experimental studies from the 1950s showed the peculiar ability of fructose to induce insulin resistance in laboratory rats. Today, fructose intake has been shown to induce all features of metabolic syndrome in rats, as well as oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, fatty liver, microalbuminuria and kidney disease (rev. in). Similar findings can be shown when animals are fed sucrose or high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), both which contain fructose. In contrast, administration of glucose or starch results in fewer features of metabolic syndrome when provided equivalent intake.

Fructose may increase the risk for obesity by altering satiety, resulting in increased food intake. The intake of fructose is not effective in stimulating insulin and leptin secretion in humans, and hence may not induce a satiety response. Other mechanisms may also be operative. For example, a high intake of fructose induces leptin resistance in rats. Fructose also encourages food intake due to stimulation of dopamine in the mesolimbic system and effects on the hypothalamus. Food intake is also stimulated by hepatic ATP depletion, which occurs in animals and humans administered fructose. Fructose may also affect metabolic rate. A recent study in humans documented a reduction in resting energy expenditure in overweight and obese subjects fed fructose but not glucose.

### Multi-regional alterations in glucose and purine metabolic pathways in the Parkinson's disease dementia brain [^112RCGHc]. NPJ Parkinson's Disease (2023). Medium credibility.

Purine metabolism

Purines are essential components of the DNA and RNA nucleobase backbone and also function as components of other metabolic molecules that are involved in a great number of metabolic pathways, such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP), cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and coenzyme A (CoA); disruptions in the purine metabolic pathway (see Fig. 6) may lead to insufficient pools of purine components for these pathways. Here, we report several alterations in purine metabolism, including widespread increases in inosine — in the CB, CG, HP, MCX, MED, PONS and PVC — increased deoxyguanosine in every investigated region, region-specific increases in guanosine, deoxyuridine-monophosphate and ureidopropionate, and localised decreases in guanine, hypoxanthine, uracil and xanthine. Increased adenosine and inosine, as well as decreased uric acid, have been previously reported in the PD cortex and striatum of males, with female-specific increases in xanthine, although such sex-specific differences were not apparent in the current PDD cohort. Together, these observations suggest substantial disruption of the purine metabolism pathway in the PDD brain (see Fig. 6).

### Salvage of ribose from uridine or RNA supports glycolysis in nutrient-limited conditions [^115p71ck]. Nature Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Glucose is vital for life, serving as both a source of energy and carbon building block for growth. When glucose is limiting, alternative nutrients must be harnessed. To identify mechanisms by which cells can tolerate complete loss of glucose, we performed nutrient-sensitized genome-wide genetic screens and a PRISM growth assay across 482 cancer cell lines. We report that catabolism of uridine from the medium enables the growth of cells in the complete absence of glucose. While previous studies have shown that uridine can be salvaged to support pyrimidine synthesis in the setting of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation deficiency 1, our work demonstrates that the ribose moiety of uridine or RNA can be salvaged to fulfil energy requirements via a pathway based on: (1) the phosphorylytic cleavage of uridine by uridine phosphorylase UPP1/UPP2 into uracil and ribose-1-phosphate (R1P), (2) the conversion of uridine-derived R1P into fructose-6-P and glyceraldehyde-3-P by the non-oxidative branch of the pentose phosphate pathway and (3) their glycolytic utilization to fuel ATP production, biosynthesis and gluconeogenesis. Capacity for glycolysis from uridine-derived ribose appears widespread, and we confirm its activity in cancer lineages, primary macrophages and mice in vivo. An interesting property of this pathway is that R1P enters downstream of the initial, highly regulated steps of glucose transport and upper glycolysis. We anticipate that 'uridine bypass' of upper glycolysis could be important in the context of disease and even exploited for therapeutic purposes.

### Modulation of de novo purine biosynthesis leads to activation of AMPK and results in improved glucose handling and insulin sensitivity [^111gQXKW]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Metabolic disorders, more specifically Type 2 Diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases that result from both environmental and genetic factors are considered to be some of the fastest growing public health problems globally. These conditions may be associated with reduced insulin action and impaired glucose and lipid metabolism. Several therapeutic options available today differ in their mode of action, efficacy to lower blood glucose and associated complications and in their side effect profiles. Since T2DM is a progressive disease worsening with time, the available drugs need to be used in varied associations and there is a pressing need to develop new therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat T2DM.

AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a phylogenetically conserved serine/threonine protein kinase, which acts as an energy sensing enzyme in the cells and is activated in response to cellular stresses that deplete the ATP levels in the cells. It is shown to act as a central 'fuel gauge', and recent studies demonstrate AMPK as one of the probable targets for antidiabetic action of leading drugs like metformin and thiazolidinediones. In addition, chemical activation of AMPK with AICAR is shown to improve blood glucose and lipid profile. Taken together the above findings support the idea that AMPK can be an attractive therapeutic target for T2DM and insulin resistance. However, developing a small molecule which regulates AMPK activity can be quite challenging considering the subtype complexity and tissue distribution of these isoforms.

### The cardiometabolic benefits of glycine: is glycine an' antidote' to dietary fructose? [^111mnqn1]. Open Heart (2014). Low credibility.

Is uric acid a mediating risk factor?

The proposal that glycine might function as an 'antidote' to the adverse metabolic impact of fructose must contend with the fact that fructose can markedly amplify production of uric acid in the liver. Administration of a bolus of fructose leads to the rapid hepatic generation of ADP owing to the unregulated activity of fructokinase; this in turn can lead to accelerated production of AMP, adenosine and purine catabolites — including the ultimate catabolite (in humans) uric acid. The ability of fructose-rich diets to boost serum urate levels is well known, and there is no reason to suppose that glycine would prevent this effect. This urate does not pose a problem in fructose-fed rodents, as their uricase activity converts urate to non-toxic allantoin — but humans do not express uricase. Human physiological levels of urate are clearly toxic to the tissues of rodents, as they promote oxidative stress via NADPH oxidase activation.

### Fructose and sugar: a major mediator of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease [^112S8ZQY]. Journal of Hepatology (2018). Low credibility.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome; its rising prevalence parallels the rise in obesity and diabetes. Historically thought to result from overnutrition and a sedentary lifestyle, recent evidence suggests that diets high in sugar (from sucrose and/or high-fructose corn syrup [HFCS]) not only increase the risk of NAFLD, but also non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Herein, we review the experimental and clinical evidence that fructose precipitates fat accumulation in the liver, due to both increased lipogenesis and impaired fat oxidation. Recent evidence suggests that the predisposition to fatty liver is linked to the metabolism of fructose by fructokinase C, which results in ATP consumption, nucleotide turnover and uric acid generation that mediate fat accumulation. Alterations to gut permeability, the microbiome, and associated endotoxemia contribute to the risk of NAFLD and NASH. Early clinical studies suggest that reducing sugary beverages and total fructose intake, especially from added sugars, may have a significant benefit on reducing hepatic fat accumulation. We suggest larger, more definitive trials to determine if lowering sugar/HFCS intake, and/or blocking uric acid generation, may help reduce NAFLD and its downstream complications of cirrhosis and chronic liver disease.

### Association between serum uric acid level and metabolic syndrome components [^116FGdWk]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

In this study, we evaluated the associations of serum uric acid levels with MetS components in individuals with or without MetS. Serum uric acid levels were significantly higher in the MetS group compared to healthy individuals after considering covariates like gender, age and BMI. This finding is in line with some other studies. Although hyperuricemia is well recognized as a risk factor for atherosclerotic diseases such as myocardial infarction and stroke, its independent association with cardiometabolic risk factors remained controversial. However, Zhang et al. showed that uric acid is an independent risk factor of MetS, and its higher concentrations increased the risk of MetS.

We found that higher serum uric acid levels, even within the normal ranges, were associated with an increased odds ratio of MetS, and remained significant even after adjusting for confounding factors. It is speculated from this study that serum uric acid is one of the determinants of the Mets. With one unit increasing of serum uric acid, the odds of developing MetS approximately doubled. Similar findings have shown that individuals with high uric acid levels have 1.6 times higher odds of developing MetS. However, the precise biological mechanisms underlying the association between serum uric acid and development of MetS remain unclear, although reduction in endothelial nitric oxide bioavailability by uric acid is likely to be involved. Nitric oxide seems to play an important role in the development of insulin resistance, and its deficiency is believed to reduce blood flow to insulin-sensitive tissues, i.e. skeletal muscle, liver, adipose tissue, leading to block the action of insulin. Furthermore, hyperinsulinemia reduces urinary uric acid excretion by the effect of insulin on urinary tubules leading to hyperuricemia.

In the present study, after controlling for sex, age and BMI, serum uric acid had significant relationship with hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL-C. These findings are in line with results of some other studies. Several past studies have shown that high level of plasma TG are related to hyperuricemia. There are some explanations for such relation. A potential mechanism is that TG synthesis accelerates the de novo synthesis of ribose-5-phosphate to phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PPRP) through the common metabolic pathway of NADP-NADPH, and as a result, uric acid production increases. Some previous studies reported negative correlation between HDL-C and serum uric acid. The mechanisms of this relation may be due to the association between decreased HDL-C levels and insulin resistance.

The present study showed that higher concentrations of serum uric acid were significantly associated with increased number of MetS components. This finding has been reported in some other similar studies.

### UDP-glucose accelerates SNAI1 mRNA decay and impairs lung cancer metastasis [^112ocmU1]. Nature (2019). Excellent credibility.

Cancer metastasis is the primary cause of morbidity and mortality, and accounts for up to 95% of cancer-related deaths 1. Cancer cells often reprogram their metabolism to efficiently support cell proliferation and survival 2,3. However, whether and how those metabolic alterations contribute to the migration of tumour cells remain largely unknown. UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase (UGDH) is a key enzyme in the uronic acid pathway, and converts UDP-glucose to UDP-glucuronic acid 4. Here we show that, after activation of EGFR, UGDH is phosphorylated at tyrosine 473 in human lung cancer cells. Phosphorylated UGDH interacts with Hu antigen R (HuR) and converts UDP-glucose to UDP-glucuronic acid, which attenuates the UDP-glucose-mediated inhibition of the association of HuR with SNAI1 mRNA and therefore enhances the stability of SNAI1 mRNA. Increased production of SNAIL initiates the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, thus promoting the migration of tumour cells and lung cancer metastasis. In addition, phosphorylation of UGDH at tyrosine 473 correlates with metastatic recurrence and poor prognosis of patients with lung cancer. Our findings reveal a tumour-suppressive role of UDP-glucose in lung cancer metastasis and uncover a mechanism by which UGDH promotes tumour metastasis by increasing the stability of SNAI1 mRNA.

### Elevated glucose represses liver glucokinase and induces its regulatory protein to safeguard hepatic phosphate homeostasis [^114NABrc]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

Induction of G6pc and elevation in the Gckr-to-Gck ratio by elevated glucose protects against excessive accumulation of phosphorylated intermediates of glucose metabolism. The hepatic concentration of glucose 6-P is approximately twofold higher in the ad libitum–fed state compared with the fasted state. However, a high-carbohydrate meal after a 48-h fast causes a far greater elevation in metabolic intermediates. Chronic meal feeding may enable adaptive regulation of gene expression to buffer metabolite accumulation. A key consequence of rapid accumulation of phosphorylated intermediates is the acute depletion of Pi, resulting in degradation of adenine nucleotides to uric acid. Two metabolic situations in which severe Pi imbalance occurs in humans are fructose loading and deficiency of G6pc in glycogen storage disease type 1. Both are characterized by depletion of liver ATP and elevated uric acid production. We show that moderate overexpression of Gck in hepatocytes above endogenous levels causes ATP depletion and enhanced uric acid production at elevated glucose. Inhibition of G6pc with S4048 further enhances these effects, confirming the role of G6pc in buffering the concentrations of phosphorylated intermediates. The attenuation of uric acid production by Gckr overexpression indicates a protective role of this Gck inhibitor in preserving homeostasis of phosphorylated metabolites. These results provide a potential explanation for the recent demonstration of an association between an intronic single nucleotide polymorphism (rs780094) in the Gckr gene and elevated serum urate levels. The minor T-allele is associated with lower fasting glucose and raised triglycerides and uric acid levels. The low glucose and high triglyceride predicts increased Gck activity, and the elevated urate is consistent with the present finding that endogenous urate production by hepatocytes is influenced by the Gck-to-Gckr ratio.

### Time course of serum uric acid accumulation and the risk of diabetes mellitus [^1111pV3h]. Nutrition & Diabetes (2022). Medium credibility.

There are several biological mechanisms underlying the relationship of cumSUA and its time course with DM. Several in vitro and in vivo studies showed that high SUA levels can induce oxidative stress, which has been established as a pathological pathway for the development of DM. First, high cumSUA produces oxidative stress via pathways involving the activation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase and the generation of oxidized lipids and inflammatory mediators. Second, high cumSUA can regulate enzymes associated with glucose and lipid metabolism primarily in the liver, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle. Through positive feedback, adipose tissue could produce and secrete additional SUA via xanthine oxidoreductase. Third, elevated cumSUA would decrease insulin sensitivity and lead to insulin resistance through altering glucose metabolism. High cumSUA can induce endothelial dysfunction and nitric oxide inhibition, which in turn contribute to insulin resistance and thus diabetes. This is supported by findings that fructose-induced hyperuricemia in rats leads to insulin resistance along with other components of metabolic syndrome, and these conditions are improved by decreasing uric acid levels.

The strengths of our prospective study is that when assessing the association between cumSUA and DM, we considered the modulated effect of time course of cumSUA accumulation, which may provide additional information. However, our study still has several limitations. First, the use of urate-lowering agents was not available. Given the low rate of hyperuricemia therapy and the controversial benefit of pharmacological treatment for asymptomatic hyperuricemia, our conclusion would not meaningfully change. Second, due to the large sample, our cohort did not take oral glucose tolerance test and measure hemoglobin A1c to diagnose DM. Considering the same diagnosis criteria being used in all the participants which will lead to nondifferentiated misclassification, the association of cumSUA and its time course with DM would be underestimated. We therefore excluded participants diagnosed with diabetes less than 2 years to avoid misclassification at baseline and increase specificity of diabetes diagnosis. Finally, our population is from a region in North China; therefore, the finding may not be generalized.

### Sugar, uric acid, and the etiology of diabetes and obesity [^117Q82eB]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Other issues related to uric acid.

Other aspects of the uric acid studies have also been questioned. One paradox is that the acute elevation of serum uric acid by infusion often results in an improvement in endothelial function. However, while uric acid is an antioxidant in the extracellular environment, it has prooxidative effects inside the cell. Several investigators have also suggested that it is not uric acid that is driving metabolic syndrome, but rather xanthine oxidase, since this enzyme generates oxidants in addition to uric acid, and it may be the former that is responsible for the metabolic syndrome. For example, high-dose allopurinol improves endothelial dysfunction in subjects with heart failure whereas the lowering of uric acid with probenecid was ineffective. However, this could simply relate to the relative superiority of allopurinol to lower intracellular uric acid as it blocks synthesis. Although xanthine oxidase–induced oxidants could be important, the observation that raising intracellular uric acid, even in the presence of allopurinol, can increase hepatic fat suggests that it is the uric acid that is responsible.

Genetic studies.

A final argument relates to the genetics of uric acid and fructose metabolism. While some genetic polymorphisms in various enzymes involved in fructose metabolism and urate transport have been linked with metabolic syndrome and hypertension, several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) could not show such associations. However, the primary polymorphism driving serum uric acid in the GWAS studies is SLC2A9; this polymorphism mediates the transport of uric acid out of tubular cells, and so it may not predict the development of diabetes because it is likely to dissociate the serum from intracellular uric acid levels, the latter of which may be more important in driving insulin resistance.

### Elevated glucose represses liver glucokinase and induces its regulatory protein to safeguard hepatic phosphate homeostasis [^1138qb7i]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

FIG. 8.
Glucose metabolism affects uric acid production by hepatocytes. A: Uric acid is the final product of purine degradation in humans because of lack of a functional urate oxidase (UAO) gene. In other mammals, uric acid is further metabolized to S-allantoin by urate oxidase. AMP-deaminase (AMPD) catalyses the conversion of AMP to inosine monophosphate and is inhibited by physiological concentrations of Pi. During ATP-dependent phosphorylation of fructose or glucose, the ADP generated at the level of fructokinase (FK) or glucokinase (GK) is reconverted to ATP by oxidative phosphorylation (OP). If accumulation of phosphorylated intermediates during sugar metabolism causes depletion of Pi, then AMPD is deinhibited, resulting in degradation of AMP to uric acid. B: Oxonic acid inhibits uric acid degradation. Rat hepatocytes were incubated for 30 or 60 min in medium containing 100 μmol/L uric acid and the concentrations of oxonic acid (μmol/L) shown. Uric degradation is expressed as nmol/h per mg protein. C: Effects of oxonic acid on uric acid accumulation in the medium (nmol/h per mg) during incubation of hepatocytes in medium containing 30 mmol/L fructose and the oxonic acid concentrations (μmol/L) indicated. D: Effects of glucose and fructose on uric acid production (UAP, expressed as % control) in hepatocytes incubated for 1 h in medium containing 500 μmol/L oxonic acid and the substrates indicated (5, 25, or 35 mmol/L substrate or 25 mmol/L substrate + S4048 [(25)S]). E: Uric acid production (expressed as % control) in hepatocytes treated with adenoviral vectors for overexpression of Gck (2.5 to 10-fold) or Gckr (four- to sixfold) and incubated for 1 h in medium containing 25 mmol/L glucose. Means ± SEM, n = 3 (B and C); n = 3–7 (D and E). ✱ p < 0.05 relative to 5 mmol/L glucose (D) or relative to untreated (E).

### Hypothesis: fructose-induced hyperuricemia as a causal mechanism for the epidemic of the metabolic syndrome [^116DKRj2]. Nature Clinical Practice: Nephrology (2005). Medium credibility.

The increasing incidence of obesity and the metabolic syndrome over the past two decades has coincided with a marked increase in total fructose intake. Fructose — unlike other sugars — causes serum uric acid levels to rise rapidly. We recently reported that uric acid reduces levels of endothelial nitric oxide (NO), a key mediator of insulin action. NO increases blood flow to skeletal muscle and enhances glucose uptake. Animals deficient in endothelial NO develop insulin resistance and other features of the metabolic syndrome. As such, we propose that the epidemic of the metabolic syndrome is due in part to fructose-induced hyperuricemia that reduces endothelial NO levels and induces insulin resistance. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that changes in mean uric acid levels correlate with the increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the US and developing countries. In addition, we observed that a serum uric acid level above 5.5 mg/dl independently predicted the development of hyperinsulinemia at both 6 and 12 months in nondiabetic patients with first-time myocardial infarction. Fructose-induced hyperuricemia results in endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance, and might be a novel causal mechanism of the metabolic syndrome. Studies in humans should be performed to address whether lowering uric acid levels will help to prevent this condition.

### Why does the gout attack stop? A roadmap for the immune pathogenesis of gout [^114vsATt]. RMD Open (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Purine metabolism in apes and humans is fundamentally different from that in all other mammalian species. Whereas all mammals share the enzyme xanthine oxidase, which is requires to degrades xanthine, a product of the purine metabolism, to uric acid, the subsequent metabolic step mediated by the enzyme uricase, cleaving uric acid to allantoin, is lacking in apes and humans. The consequence of this loss of uricase is that the uric acid level is comparatively high in humans even at steady state conditions, as uric acid cannot be degraded and resembles the final product of purine catabolism. To allow the body to get rid of uric acid, which continuously accumulates in the body due to tissue turnover, excretion is preferentially managed by the kidney and, to a lesser extent, by the gut.

### Serum uric acid mediates the association between the estimated glucose disposal rate and chronic kidney disease in patients with diabetes or prediabetes: an analysis from NHANES 2005–2018 [^116AXsPC]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Diabetes and prediabetes have become core challenges in global public health. The latest statistical report shows that the prevalence of diabetes among adults aged 20 to 79 worldwide is 10.5% (536.6 million), and the prevalence of prediabetes is as high as 5.8% (298 million). Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is one of the most common and fatal microvascular complications of diabetes and prediabetes. Multiple epidemiological survey results have shown that approximately 30% to 40% of diabetic patients and 16% to 18% of prediabetic patients have CKD. A longitudinal study involving over 330,000 people revealed that diabetes and prediabetes are independent risk factors for CKD. Although intensive blood glucose control can improve renal outcomes, traditional indicators such as glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) can explain only part of renal function heterogeneity, suggesting the need to search for more sensitive risk markers.

### Uric acid and the cardio-renal effects of SGLT2 inhibitors [^114UyTmM]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2019). Medium credibility.

Sodium/glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which lower blood glucose by increasing renal glucose elimination, have been shown to reduce the risk of adverse cardiovascular (CV) and renal events in type 2 diabetes. This has been ascribed, in part, to haemodynamic changes, body weight reduction and several possible effects on myocardial, endothelial and tubulo-glomerular functions, as well as to reduced glucotoxicity. This review evaluates evidence that an effect of SGLT2 inhibitors to lower uric acid may also contribute to reduced cardio-renal risk. Chronically elevated circulating uric acid concentrations are associated with increased risk of hypertension, CV disease and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The extent to which uric acid contributes to these conditions, either as a cause or an aggravating factor, remains unclear, but interventions that reduce urate production or increase urate excretion in hyperuricaemic patients have consistently improved cardio-renal prognoses. Uric acid concentrations are often elevated in type 2 diabetes, contributing to the "metabolic syndrome" of CV risk. Treating type 2 diabetes with an SGLT2 inhibitor increases uric acid excretion, reduces circulating uric acid and improves parameters of CV and renal function. This raises the possibility that the lowering of uric acid by SGLT2 inhibition may assist in reducing adverse CV events and slowing progression of CKD in type 2 diabetes. SGLT2 inhibition might also be useful in the treatment of gout and gouty arthritis, especially when co-existent with diabetes.

### Metabolic factors mediate the association between serum uric acid to serum creatinine ratio and cardiovascular disease [^112SScZE]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

To investigate the potential pathways between SUA/SCr and CVD, mediation analyses were performed by considering cardiometabolic factors as mediators. The results showed that TG, TC, BMI, DBP, hs‐CRP, and FBG played fundamental roles in these pathways. Regarding the mediating role of lipids, previous studies reported that higher SUA had an unfavorable impact on lipids, and was associated with dyslipidemia.SUA and lipid metabolic disorder are mutually associated. An increase in SUA can lead to a decline in lipoprotein enzymes that affect lipid metabolism, eventually resulting in alteration of adipose factors that regulate fat synthesis. Therefore, lipids may mediate the association between SUA/SCr and CVD. Regarding obesity and indicators of inflammation, SUA can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome and induce the production of inflammatory factors, and SUA acts on fat cells, which induces an inflammatory response. In the state of obesity, SUA can be converted into an oxidant and participate directly in proliferation and oxidative stress of fat. Inflammation and oxidative stress are major contributors in the pathology of CVD. Regarding blood pressure, many previous studies confirmed that SUA is associated with the risk of hypertension. Moreover, SUA can activate the renin‐angiotensin system, decrease renal blood flow, induce endothelial cell dysfunction, and further stimulate vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation in systemic circulation, and these mechanisms lead to the occurrence of hypertension and CVD. However, in the present study, FBG had a negative mediating effect on the association between SUA and CVD, suggesting an inverse link between SUA and FBG. Indeed, the negative association between SUA and FBG is consistent with findings from previous studies. A cross‐sectional survey in Southern China reported a correlation coefficient of −0.26 between SUA and FBG in patients with type 2 diabetes. Data from the Riyadh 2 cohort showed that FBG was decreased with increased SUA/SCr, and subjects in the highest tertile of SUA/SCr had the lowest levels of FBG. Similar results were also observed in a retrospective study, which showed a negative correlation between SUA/SCr and diabetes (r = −0.075) and FBG (−0.059). One study has shown that the hyperfiltration state caused by hyperglycemia can promote excretion of SUA, which partially explains the existence of the inverse association. Our results showed that TG, TC, and DBP played mediating roles in the association between SUA/SCr and CVD. Although LDL‐C, HDL‐C, and SBP were not shown to play mediating roles in this association, this does not necessarily imply that they are not associated with SUA/SCr or CVD. Possible explanations required further investigations.

### Sugar, uric acid, and the etiology of diabetes and obesity [^113UBCiW]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Clinical studies: the importance of the control group.

Recently, a number of investigators have presented meta-analyses that suggest fructose does not have a causal relationship with obesity or metabolic syndrome. Before we analyze these studies, it is important to understand the complexity related to their interpretation. First, many clinical studies use fructose alone — and often at relatively high doses — in order to evaluate the effects of fructose per se. This allows one to directly address the effects of fructose, and the use of high doses is a common experimental approach to allow one to identify metabolic effects that could otherwise take much longer periods to show. Indeed, the fact that metabolic syndrome could be induced de novo in 25% of healthy men with high doses of fructose in just 2 weeks is a statement of how strong this approach can be. Although studies involving HFCS or sucrose might be clinically more relevant, these types of studies will have trouble distinguishing whether the metabolic effects observed are from the fructose or the high glycemic content of these added sugars.

Nevertheless, the administration of fructose alone can be very difficult to interpret because the absorption of fructose when given alone is quite variable. As many as two-thirds of children and one-third of adults malabsorb fructose. This is likely because of variable expression of the fructose transporter GLUT5 in the gut. Expression of GLUT5 and the enzyme KHK, however, are enhanced with repeated exposure to fructose. It is interesting that studies in children have found an inverse relationship between fructose malabsorption and obesity. Consistent with this data, the metabolic response to fructose in children with NAFLD is greater compared with lean control subjects. The importance of fructose absorption has recently been highlighted in African Americans because they commonly malabsorb fructose and also have a lower frequency of NAFLD. The observation that NAFLD subjects may absorb fructose more efficiently is further supported by our observation of higher KHK expression in liver biopsies of NAFLD compared with other liver disease and could be the reason why ATP depletion in response to fructose is greater in NAFLD subjects with a higher prior exposure to dietary fructose. Our observation that hyperuricemia may regulate KHK also provides an explanation for why studies in which fructose is given to young athletic lean individuals are often negative and why they may not carry over to older and heavier individuals.

### Changes over time in uric acid in relation to changes in insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function, and glycemia [^112rPtXb]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Context

Serum uric acid has been linked to risk of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), but debate persists as to whether it plays a causal role. Indeed, it is unclear if changes in uric acid relate to the pathophysiologic determinants of T2DM (insulin resistance, beta-cell dysfunction), as would be expected if causal.

Objective

To evaluate the impact of changes in uric acid over 2 years on changes in insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function, and glycemia in women with and without recent gestational diabetes (GDM), a model of the early natural history of T2DM.

Design/Setting/Participants

At both 1 and 3 years postpartum, 299 women (96 with recent GDM) underwent uric acid measurement and oral glucose tolerance tests that enabled assessment of insulin sensitivity/resistance (Matsuda index, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]), beta-cell function (insulin secretion-sensitivity index-2 [ISSI-2], insulinogenic index/HOMA-IR [IGI/HOMA-IR]), and glucose tolerance.

Results

Women with recent GDM had higher serum uric acid than their peers at both 1 year (281 ± 69 vs 262 ± 58 µmol/L, P = 0.01) and 3 years postpartum (271 ± 59 vs 256 ± 55 µmol/L, P = 0.03), coupled with lower insulin sensitivity, poorer beta-cell function, and greater glycemia (all P < 0.05). However, on fully adjusted analyses, neither uric acid at 1 year nor its change from 1 to 3 years was independently associated with any of the following metabolic outcomes at 3 years postpartum: Matsuda index, HOMA-IR, ISSI-2, IGI/HOMA-IR, fasting glucose, 2-hour glucose, or glucose intolerance.

Conclusion

Serum uric acid does not track with changes over time in insulin sensitivity, beta-cell function, or glycemia in women with recent GDM, providing evidence against causality in its association with diabetes.

### Uric acid, the metabolic syndrome, and renal disease [^114kd17o]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2006). Low credibility.

Metabolic syndrome, characterized by truncal obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, elevated BP, and insulin resistance, is recognized increasingly as a major risk factor for kidney disease and also is a common feature of patients who are on dialysis. One feature that is common to patients with metabolic syndrome is an elevated uric acid. Although often considered to be secondary to hyperinsulinemia, recent evidence supports a primary role for uric acid in mediating this syndrome. Specifically, fructose, which rapidly can cause metabolic syndrome in rats, also raises uric acid, and lowering uric acid in fructose-fed rats prevents features of the metabolic syndrome. Uric acid also can accelerate renal disease in experimental animals and epidemiologically is associated with progressive renal disease in humans. It is proposed that fructose- and purine-rich foods that have in common the raising of uric acid may have a role in the epidemic of metabolic syndrome and renal disease that is occurring throughout the world.

### Hyperuricemia and gout reduction by SGLT2 inhibitors in diabetes and heart Failure: JACC Review topic of the week [^111yDEen]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Gout is characterized by increased production of purines (through the pentose phosphate pathway), which is coupled with reduced renal or intestinal excretion of urate. Concurrent upregulation of nutrient surplus signaling (mammalian target of rapamycin and hypoxia-inducible factor-1a) and downregulation of nutrient deprivation signaling (sirtuin-1 and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase) redirects glucose toward anabolic pathways (rather than adenosine triphosphate production), thus promoting heightened oxidative stress and cardiomyocyte and proximal tubular dysfunction, leading to cardiomyopathy and kidney disease. Hyperuricemia is a marker (rather than a driver) of these cellular stresses. By inducing a state of starvation mimicry in a state of nutrient surplus, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors decrease flux through the pentose phosphate pathway (thereby attenuating purine and urate synthesis) while promoting renal urate excretion. These convergent actions exert a meaningful effect to lower serum uric acid by ≈0.6 to 1.5 mg/dL and to reduce the risk of gout by 30% to 50% in large-scale clinical trials.

### A metabolomics-based molecular pathway analysis of how the sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin may slow kidney function decline in patients with diabetes [^114r2hjT]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Among the metabolites that were reduced, lipids were over‐represented and constituted > 50% of the downregulated identified metabolites (Table S 2). Lipid species from several different lipid classes were reduced, including diacylglycerols, endocannabinoids, dicarboxylic acids and monohydroxylated, mainly 3‐hydroxylated, fatty acids. A marked reduction in a dihydroxy fatty acid, 12,13‐HOME, was also observed. Interestingly, several primary and secondary bile acids were reduced, indicating reduced bile acid pool. As expected, treatment reduced plasma glucose levels and other simple carbohydrates. The change in fasting glucose correlated well with the quantitative changes in fasting glucose measured previously (ρ = 0.79, P < 0.0001). As previously observed, plasma levels of urate were reduced. 5 Three metabolites in xanthine metabolism including theophylline, which is upstream urate in purine degradation, were reduced. Alanine and glutamine were the only amino acids reduced in plasma. Intermediates in the TCA cycle, including succinate, fumarate and malate, were reduced.

### Serum uric acid levels improve prediction of incident type 2 diabetes in individuals with impaired fasting glucose: the rancho bernardo study [^115jXAh5]. Diabetes Care (2009). Low credibility.

Increased levels of serum uric acid have been associated with insulin resistance and with established type 2 diabetes. Previous studies demonstrated that uric acid is an independent predictor of incident type 2 diabetes in general populations, but whether uric acid predicts incident type 2 diabetes in individuals who have abnormal glucose tolerance is unknown. We examined whether baseline uric acid levels predict incident type 2 diabetes by glucose tolerance status in older adults.

### State-of-the-art-review: mechanisms of action of SGLT2 inhibitors and clinical implications [^1139Z5Zy]. American Journal of Hypertension (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Inhibitors of the Na+-coupled glucose transporter SGLT2 (SGLT2i) primarily shift the reabsorption of large amounts of glucose from the kidney's early proximal tubule to downstream tubular segments expressing SGLT1, and the non-reabsorbed glucose is spilled into the urine together with some osmotic diuresis. How can this protect the kidneys and heart from failing as observed in individuals with and without type 2 diabetes?

Goal

Mediation analyses identified clinical phenotypes of SGLT2i associated with improved kidney and heart outcome, including a reduction of plasma volume or increase in hematocrit, and lowering of serum urate levels and albuminuria. This review outlines how primary effects of SGLT2i on the early proximal tubule can explain these phenotypes.

Results

The physiology of tubule-glomerular communication provides the basis for acute lowering of GFR and glomerular capillary pressure, which contributes to lowering of albuminuria but also to long term preservation of GFR, at least in part by reducing kidney cortex oxygen demand. Functional co-regulation of SGLT2 with other sodium and metabolite transporters in the early proximal tubule explains why SGLT2i initially excrete more sodium than expected and are uricosuric, thereby reducing plasma volume and serum urate. Inhibition of SGLT2 reduces early proximal tubule gluco-toxicity and by shifting transport downstream may simulate "systemic hypoxia", and the resulting increase in erythropoiesis, together with the osmotic diuresis, enhances hematocrit and improves blood oxygen delivery. Cardio-renal protection by SGLT2i is also provided by a fasting-like and insulin-sparing metabolic phenotype and, potentially, by off-target effects on the heart and microbiotic formation of uremic toxins.

A role for uric acid in fructose-induced fat accumulation

The observation that fructose-fed rats develop fatty liver and metabolic syndrome without requiring increased energy intake suggests that the metabolism of fructose may be different from that of other carbohydrates. Fructose is distinct from glucose only in its initial metabolism. The first enzyme to metabolize fructose is fructokinase (also known as ketohexokinase [KHK]). The metabolism of fructose to fructose-1-phosphate by KHK occurs primarily in the liver, is rapid and without any negative feedback, and results in a fall in intracellular phosphate and ATP levels. This has been shown to occur in the liver in humans with relatively small doses of oral fructose (60 g fructose alone or 39 g fructose with 39 g glucose). The decrease in intracellular phosphate stimulates AMP deaminase (AMPD), which catalyzes the degradation of AMP to inosine monophosphate and eventually uric acid (Fig. 1). The increase in intracellular uric acid is followed by an acute rise in uric acid in the circulation likely due to its release from the liver. Fructose also stimulates uric acid synthesis from amino acid precursors, such as glycine.

### Uric acid is a biomarker of oxidative stress in the failing heart: lessons learned from trials with allopurinol and SGLT2 inhibitors [^112bbxBs]. Journal of Cardiac Failure (2020). Medium credibility.

Hyperuricemia increases the risk of heart failure, and higher levels of serum uric acid are seen in patients who have worse ventricular function, functional capacity, and prognosis. Heart failure is also accompanied by an upregulation of xanthine oxidase, the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of uric acid and a purported source of reactive oxygen species. However, the available evidence does not support the premise that either uric acid or the activation of xanthine oxidase has direct injurious effects on the heart in the clinical setting. Xanthine oxidase inhibitors (allopurinol and oxypurinol) have had little benefit and may exert detrimental effects in patients with chronic heart failure in randomized controlled trials, and the more selective and potent inhibitor febuxostat increases the risk of cardiovascular death more than allopurinol. Instead, the available evidence indicates that changes in xanthine oxidase and uric acid are biomarkers of oxidative stress (particularly in heart failure) and that xanthine oxidase may provide an important source of nitric oxide that quenches the injurious effects of reactive oxygen species. A primary determinant of the cellular redox state is nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, whose levels drive an inverse relationship between xanthine oxidase and sirtuin-1, a nutrient deprivation sensor that exerts important antioxidant and cardioprotective effects. Interestingly, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors induce a state of nutrient deprivation that includes activation of sirtuin-1, suppression of xanthine oxidase, and lowering of serum uric acid. The intermediary role of sirtuin-1 in both uric acid-lowering and cardioprotection may explain why, in mediation analyses of large-scale cardiovascular trials, the effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors to decrease serum uric acid is a major predictor of the ability of these drugs to decrease serious heart failure events.

Fructose-induced hyperuricemia, insulin resistance, and diabetes

The observation that inhibition of uric acid synthesis prevented metabolic syndrome and hepatic steatosis leads to the question of how uric acid might contribute to insulin resistance and diabetes.

Hepatic effects.

The observation that uric acid can induce mitochondrial oxidative stress and fatty liver may explain how fructose induces insulin resistance. Mitochondrial oxidative stress has a role in driving insulin resistance. In turn, the development of fatty liver is also linked with insulin resistance.

Effects in the white adipose tissue.

Uric acid may also induce insulin resistance via effects on adipocytes. Uric acid is taken up in adipocytes by an organic anion transporter where it induces oxidative stress via activation of NADPH oxidase, generating oxidized lipids and inflammatory mediators such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). Adiponectin synthesis is also inhibited. In the hyperuricemic Pound mouse, the inhibition of uric acid synthesis by allopurinol attenuates the local inflammatory response in the visceral fat, reduces the expression of inflammatory cytokines, and enhances circulating levels of adiponectin in association with an improvement in insulin resistance. Likewise, the reduction of uric acid by either allopurinol or benzbromarone in the fructose-fed rat results in less insulin resistance and decreases the leptin overexpression that occurs in the visceral fat.

Vascular effects.

Fructose may also induce insulin resistance via effects on the vasculature. One of the major effects of insulin is to stimulate the release of NO from endothelial cells, where it causes vasodilation that aids delivery of glucose to the skeletal muscle. Mice that cannot generate endothelial NO develop features of metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. In this regard, uric acid inhibits endothelial NO generation, including in response to insulin. Uric acid reduces endothelial NO via several mechanisms, including blocking the uptake of the substrate,-arginine, stimulating the degradation of-arginine by arginase, and scavenging NO by uric acid or by uric acid–generated oxidants. Hyperuricemic rats have impaired endothelial function and hypertension that can be reversed by lowering uric acid or treating with-arginine or antioxidants. Hyperuricemia is also associated with endothelial dysfunction in humans, and lowering uric acid with allopurinol improves endothelial dysfunction in asymptomatic hyperuricemia, congestive heart failure, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, obstructive sleep apnea, and with smoking (rev. in).

### Canagliflozin reduces epicardial fat in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^1125ZpX4]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

We showed that canagliflozin decreased the level of uric acid. The mechanism by which SGLT2 inhibitors reduce the level of uric acid has not been fully established. However, the facilitative glucose transporter 9 isoform 2 (SLC2A9b) may be involved: it is expressed at the apical membrane of the renal tubular cells and exchanges glucose for uric acid. Higher glucose concentrations in urine, which are attributable to canagliflozin treatment, could increase the exchange of uric acid in the apical membrane of tubular cells through the transporter, increase the release of uric acid from blood into the urine, and thereby reduce the serum uric acid levels. This potential mechanism has been supported by the evidence of trans-stimulation of uric acid efflux with high glucose concentrations in Xenopus oocytes expressing SLC2A9b.

The present study had several limitations. First, the study is a single-arm observational study with a small sample size. Thus, the study contains a patient selection bias and less statistical power due to the patients' heterogeneity. Second, the observational period was relatively short. Hence, the long-term effects of SGLT2 inhibitors could not be analyzed. Third, we could not exclude the effects of concomitant drugs that can affect glucose metabolism, even though the patients' drugs were not changed during the study period. Fourth, because of a methodological issue, we evaluated only EAT thickness and did not study the effect of canagliflozin on EAT volume. Randomized, large, clinical cohort studies with a longer observation period are needed to evaluate further the findings of this study.

### High plasma uric acid concentration: causes and consequences [^113NsaSP]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2012). Low credibility.

High plasma uric acid (UA) is a precipitating factor for gout and renal calculi as well as a strong risk factor for Metabolic Syndrome and cardiovascular disease. The main causes for higher plasma UA are either lower excretion, higher synthesis or both. Higher waist circumference and the BMI are associated with higher insulin resistance and leptin production, and both reduce uric acid excretion. The synthesis of fatty acids (tryglicerides) in the liver is associated with the de novo synthesis of purine, accelerating UA production. The role played by diet on hyperuricemia has not yet been fully clarified, but high intake of fructose-rich industrialized food and high alcohol intake (particularly beer) seem to influence uricemia. It is not known whether UA would be a causal factor or an antioxidant protective response. Most authors do not consider the UA as a risk factor, but presenting antioxidant function. UA contributes to > 50% of the antioxidant capacity of the blood. There is still no consensus if UA is a protective or a risk factor, however, it seems that acute elevation is a protective factor, whereas chronic elevation a risk for disease.

### Potential role of sugar (fructose) in the epidemic of hypertension, obesity and the metabolic syndrome, diabetes, kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease [^1135MJD4]. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2007). Low credibility.

Currently, we are experiencing an epidemic of cardiorenal disease characterized by increasing rates of obesity, hypertension, the metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and kidney disease. Whereas excessive caloric intake and physical inactivity are likely important factors driving the obesity epidemic, it is important to consider additional mechanisms. We revisit an old hypothesis that sugar, particularly excessive fructose intake, has a critical role in the epidemic of cardiorenal disease. We also present evidence that the unique ability of fructose to induce an increase in uric acid may be a major mechanism by which fructose can cause cardiorenal disease. Finally, we suggest that high intakes of fructose in African Americans may explain their greater predisposition to develop cardiorenal disease, and we provide a list of testable predictions to evaluate this hypothesis.

### Hypothesis: could excessive fructose intake and uric acid cause type 2 diabetes? [^113w2sjr]. Endocrine Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

We propose that excessive fructose intake (> 50 g/d) may be one of the underlying etiologies of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. The primary sources of fructose are sugar (sucrose) and high fructose corn syrup. First, fructose intake correlates closely with the rate of diabetes worldwide. Second, unlike other sugars, the ingestion of excessive fructose induces features of metabolic syndrome in both laboratory animals and humans. Third, fructose appears to mediate the metabolic syndrome in part by raising uric acid, and there are now extensive experimental and clinical data supporting uric acid in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome. Fourth, environmental and genetic considerations provide a potential explanation of why certain groups might be more susceptible to developing diabetes. Finally, we discuss the counterarguments associated with the hypothesis and a potential explanation for these findings. If diabetes might result from excessive intake of fructose, then simple public health measures could have a major impact on improving the overall health of our populace.

### Long-term feeding of high-fat plus high-fructose diet induces isolated impaired glucose tolerance and skeletal muscle insulin resistance in miniature pigs [^112U6xuD]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2017). Low credibility.

Fructose consumption is a potential factor that induced hepatic de novo lipogenesis resulting in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and hepatic insulin resistance. Unexpectedly, the HFHF pigs did not develop fatty liver (as assessed by histological analysis), tremendous hepatic triglyceride content (Additional file 1: Figures S1, S2), hyperuricemia, and hyperglycemia, the outcomes of elevated endogenous glucose production under conditions of hepatic insulin resistance. Clinical studies have indicated that only small amounts, 0.05 and 0.15%, of absorbed fructose are converted de novo to fatty acids and triglyceride-glycerol, respectively, and most, 28.9–37.4%, is converted to glucose. However, fructose consumption indeed increases newly synthesized triglyceride-glycerol in circulating VLDL, which suggests that fructose may alter hepatic lipid metabolism through other mechanisms instead of direct contribution to lipid synthesis. It has been demonstrated that uric acid mediates fructose-induced lipid accumulation in hepatocytes. Metabolizing fructose transiently depletes intracellular ATP and results in uric acid overproduction, which causes mitochondrial oxidative stress and de novo lipogenesis. Unlike the human, deficient in functional uricase, most mammalians are able to metabolize uric acid and therefore have relatively low level of uric acid in circulation. In the context of the present study, the metabolism of fructose and uric acid in the pigs may be different than humans, resulting in a lack of fructose-induced hyperuricemia, hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance.

Problems with the fructose and uric acid hypothesis

Concerns with animal studies.

The fructose-induced hyperuricemia hypothesis has been challenged. First, animal studies using fructose typically use pure fructose as opposed to sucrose or HFCS, which is the primary source of fructose in humans, and the dose of fructose administered to rodents is usually higher (50–60% of the diet) compared with humans (where it is typically 10–15% of the diet). Purified fructose is used, however, so one can separate the effects of fructose from glucose. Indeed, animals are more sensitive to the combination of fructose and glucose because both sugars accelerate the absorption of the other. Combinations of free fructose and glucose, or sucrose, induce features of metabolic syndrome with levels of fructose of 20–30% dietary intake.

Furthermore, rodents are relatively resistant to fructose in part because they generate less uric acid in response to fructose due to the presence of the uricase gene in their liver. Uricase degrades uric acid to allantoin, and as a consequence, rats degrade uric acid rapidly after it is formed in their liver. When uricase is inhibited, rats show a greater metabolic response to fructose with worse fatty liver and higher blood pressure. Indeed, there is evidence that the loss of uricase may have provided a survival advantage to ancestral apes living in Europe in the mid-Miocene and therefore may have acted like a thrifty gene. The subsequent rise in sugar intake over the last centuries may have acted in concert with the loss of uricase to predispose us to obesity and diabetes.

### The effect of fructose on renal biology and disease [^114mXc19]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2010). Low credibility.

Dietary fructose intake is increasing. It is increasing primarily from added sugars, including sucrose and high fructose corn syrup, and correlates epidemiologically with the rising prevalence of metabolic syndrome and hypertension worldwide. The administration of fructose to animals and humans increases BP and the development of metabolic syndrome. These changes occur independently of caloric intake because of the effect of fructose on ATP depletion and uric acid generation. Fructose ingestion may also be a risk factor for kidney disease that includes glomerular hypertension, renal inflammation, and tubulointerstitial injury in animals. We suggest excessive fructose intake should be considered an environmental toxin with major health implications.

### Insulin restores metabolic function in cultured cortical neurons subjected to oxidative stress [^116wMtX7]. Diabetes (2006). Low credibility.

We previously demonstrated that insulin has a neuroprotective role against oxidative stress, a deleterious condition associated with diabetes, ischemia, and age-related neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we investigated the effect of insulin on neuronal glucose uptake and metabolism after oxidative stress in rat primary cortical neurons. On oxidative stress, insulin stimulates neuronal glucose uptake and subsequent metabolism into pyruvate, restoring intracellular ATP and phosphocreatine. Insulin also increases intracellular and decreases extracellular adenosine, counteracting the effect of oxidative stress. Insulin effects are apparently mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-K and extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathways. Extracellular adenosine under oxidative stress is largely inhibited after blockade of ecto-5'-nucleotidase, suggesting that extracellular adenosine results preferentially from ATP release and catabolism. Moreover, insulin appears to interfere with the ATP release induced by oxidative stress, regulating extracellular adenosine levels. In conclusion, insulin neuroprotection against oxidative stress-mediated damage involves 1) stimulation of glucose uptake and metabolism, increasing energy levels and intracellular adenosine and, ultimately, uric acid formation and 2) a decrease in extracellular adenosine, which may reduce the facilitatory activity of adenosine receptors.

### The mechanisms underlying fructose-induced hypertension: a review [^112S6qdi]. Journal of Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

Uric acid

The first step in the metabolism of fructose is phosphorylation to fructose 1-phosphate by fructokinase, which uses ATP as a phosphate donor. Unlike glucose, whose phosphorylation is tightly regulated so that intracellular ATP levels are never depleted, there is no feedback mechanism regulating the phosphorylation of fructose. As a result, intracellular phosphate levels continue to fall and AMP deaminase is activated. This enzyme converts AMP to inosine monophosphate (IMP), which is further metabolized to hypoxanthine. Xanthine oxidase then converts hypoxanthine to xanthine to uric acid.

Nguyen et al. have used NHANES data to investigate the relationship between sugar-sweetened beverage intake and serum uric acid in US adolescents. The authors found that serum uric acid increased by 0.18 mg/dl (11 μmol/l) from the lowest to the highest category of sugar-sweetened beverage intake, a statistically significant rise that was paralleled by an increase in BP. Since glucose metabolism does not enhance uric acid production, it can be assumed that the higher uric acid levels were associated with the fructose content of the drinks. Several decades ago, Macdonald et al. showed that oral fructose raises serum uric acid significantly in normal individuals, whereas oral glucose has no effect.

In rats, plasma uric acid is also found to increase during high fructose diet regimes. Moreover, xanthine oxidase inhibitors that lower uric acid have been shown to decrease BP. Allopurinol and febuxostat have both been reported to lower SBP in fructose-fed rats, though the reduction was not statistically significant for febuxostat. Allopurinol has also been reported to normalize the effects of fructose on BP in healthy adult men. The men consumed 200 g of fructose daily for 2 weeks with or without allopurinol. In the group that did not receive allopurinol, serum uric acid increased by 21.2%, whereas a 31.7% decrease from baseline was observed in the allopurinol group. SBP rose by 5.5% in the nonallopurinol group, compared to 1.5% in the allopurinol group, whereas DBP rose by 6.3% in the nonallopurinol group and 1% in the allopurinol group. Thus, both animal and human studies indicate that allopurinol attenuates the development of fructose-induced hypertension by lowering uric acid.

### Modulation of de novo purine biosynthesis leads to activation of AMPK and results in improved glucose handling and insulin sensitivity [^116YAYHG]. Journal of Diabetes and Metabolic Disorders (2014). Low credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Purine nucleotides, apart from being a part of nucleic acids, act as key regulators of vital functions of cell including cell metabolism, cell proliferation and cell death. They are the essential carriers of chemical energy such as ATP. Purine metabolite state modulates the AMP/ATP ratio and can impact mitochondrial function as well as AMPK activity affecting key cellular functions such as skeletal muscle oxidative capacity and glucose oxidation, hepatic glucose output, glucose sensitivity and islet insulin secretion – all of which can affect glucose homeostasis. Under diabetic condition, metabolic stress can lead to reduced mitochondrial function which can impact the cellular ATP pools. This in conjunction with reduced glucose metabolism due to insulin resistance, can result in reduced purine metabolites, making it rate limiting for further cellular processes. Earlier studies indicate that under insulin resistance and diabetic conditions, the mitochondrial function is compromised leading to reduced ATP synthesis.

### A' complexity' of urate transporters [^116fE8rK]. Kidney International (2010). Low credibility.

Genetic variation in the SLC2A9 gene is a new genetic risk factor for low fractional excretion of uric acid, hyperuricemia, and gout. Its gene product, GLUT9, was previously known as a type II glucose/fructose transporter but is now known to function as a high-capacity uric acid transporter that is expressed in kidney, liver, and several other tissues. Follow-up meta-analyses, including one with data from 28,141 individuals, implicated a total of nine additional loci influencing serum urate concentrations, including six other membrane transporters (SLC17A1, SLC17A3, SLC22A11, SLC22A12, SLC16A9, and ABCG2). Variants in these genes together account for about 5% of the variance in serum urate, two-thirds of which is due to SLC2A9. Using these variants in 'Mendelian randomization' analyses provides a powerful means of dissecting the role of urate in cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, where cause-and-effect influences are difficult to discern due to potential confounding. The results highlight the complex interplay of membrane transporters involved in urate metabolism. They also show how variants of weak effect identified by genome-wide association studies can still be important in identifying novel pathways, including a 'complexity' of new and potentially druggable targets for modifying urate transport.

### Association between serum uric acid levels and long-term mortality of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease: a nationwide cohort study [^117Avz5F]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2023). Medium credibility.

The association between SUA and mortality in participants with MAFLD varies across sex and causes in our study. Based on our results, CVD mortality in MAFLD patients was exacerbated by high SUA levels regardless of sex, which was in line with the meta-analysis conducted in the general population. On the contrary, we found that low SUA level was significantly associated with increased cancer mortality in males. This finding was in line with the findings of a large 38-years cohort study that higher SUA levels were associated with a lower risk of lung, colorectal, and prostate cancer mortality among males. Recently, consensus have been reached that controlling SUA levels is beneficial for decreasing cardiovascular risk. However, there is still no clear guide in terms of MAFLD. MAFLD is a phenotype with complex and disparate causes, which indicates that effective treatment will require personalized assessment. Our analyses may offer evidence for the necessity of screening SUA levels in a general population and controlling SUA levels within the appropriate range in MAFLD patients for a better prognosis.

The mechanisms by which uric acid is associated with MAFLD remains unclear, but several studies offered possible explanations. Inflammation has been considered to involve in the pathogenesis of fatty liver disease. Both soluble urate and monosodium urate (MSU) crystal act as a damage-associated molecular pattern, which could trigger inflammatory responses and pathologic consequences. The NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome can be activated by MSU crystals, resulting in the production of its downstream effectors interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 in gout patients. Correspondingly, our previous study has shown that uric acid regulates hepatic steatosis and impairs insulin sensitivity through activating the NLRP3 inflammasome both in vivo and in vitro. Besides, uric acid acts as a modulator of glucose and lipid metabolism. Choi et al. demonstrated that uric acid induces triglyceride accumulation by activating sterol regulatory element-binding protein via induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress in hepatocytes. Furthermore, uric acid generated during fructose metabolism may even amplify the effects of endogenous fructose production and de novo lipogenesis by stimulating aldose reductase in the polyol pathway, and inhibiting aconitase in the Krebs cycle. These data may support our findings that uric acid is an important factor in hepatic steatosis.

### Obesity-related hypogonadism in women [^114G5F1k]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

Hyperandrogenemia increases uric acid by inducing hepatic metabolism of purine nucleotides and increasing purine renewal in kidney. Hyperuricemia in turn induces IR through suppression of both basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Consequently, serum uric acid was positively associated with visceral obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Interestingly, uric acid to creatinine ratio strongly correlated with free androgen index (r = 0.81). Women with obesity and PCOS had significantly higher uric acid to creatinine ratio than those without PCOS. The combination of uric acid to creatinine ratio and free androgen index increased the odds of PCOS in women with obesity by 4.3-fold (95% CI 3.4–7.6).

Obesity is associated with both inflammation and hyperandrogenism. Recently, inflammation has been suggested to directly increase ovarian androgen production. An inflammatory stimulus increased androstenedione production from rat ovarian theca interstitial cells, and this effect could be blocked by a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. Furthermore, a 3-week pilot trial in women with PCOS showed that ibuprofen (400 mg twice daily in women with bodyweight < 70 kg; or 400 mg 3 times daily if > 70 kg) reduced total testosterone from 0.75 ± 0.06 ng/mL to 0.59 ± 0.05 ng/mL (P = 0.008). These studies support the concept of inhibiting ovarian hyperandrogenism by suppressing inflammatory pathways.

### Sugar, uric acid, and the etiology of diabetes and obesity [^111jzi9y]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

This is relevant to subjects with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Subjects with NAFLD ingest more fructose-containing soft drinks than age, sex, and BMI-matched control subjects and have increased KHK expression in their liver. Subjects with NAFLD who have the highest fructose intake also show the greatest ATP depletion in response to a fructose load, and those subjects with the highest uric acid levels show a greater nadir in the ATP depletion. These data are consistent with an induction of KHK in the liver with subsequent increased sensitivity to the effects of fructose via a uric acid–dependent mechanism.

Rodents have lower serum uric acid than humans due to the presence of uricase in their liver, and hence show a lesser rise in serum uric acid in response to fructose. Nevertheless, lowering uric acid has also been found to block the development of hepatic steatosis in fructose-fed rats. Lowering uric acid also reduces hepatic steatosis in the desert gerbil (which spontaneously develops fatty liver on a normal diet), in alcoholic fatty liver (in which increased intrahepatic uric acid occurs), and in the Pound mouse (a mouse model of metabolic syndrome manifesting fatty liver, obesity, insulin resistance, and hypertension caused by a leptin receptor mutation). These studies supported the tight association of hyperuricemia with fatty liver; prospective studies have also reported that an elevated uric acid independently predicts the development of NAFLD. The ability of hyperuricemia to predict fatty liver is independent of obesity. Hyperuricemia is even associated with NAFLD in hemodialysis subjects who have a BMI below 20. A summary of how fructose and uric acid induce fatty liver is shown in Fig. 2.

In the classical pathway, triglycerides (TG) are a direct product of fructose metabolism by the action of multiple enzymes including aldolase B (Aldo B) and fatty acid synthase (FAS). An alternative mechanism was recently shown. Uric acid produced from the nucleotide turnover that occurs during the phosphorylation of fructose to fructose-1-phosphate (F-1-P) results in the generation of mitochondrial oxidative stress (mtROS), which causes a decrease in the activity of aconitase (ACO2) in the Krebs cycle. As a consequence, the ACO2 substrate, citrate, accumulates and is released to the cytosol where it acts as substrate for TG synthesis through the activation of ATP citrate lyase (ACL) and fatty acid synthase.

### Elevated glucose represses liver glucokinase and induces its regulatory protein to safeguard hepatic phosphate homeostasis [^113YdkgK]. Diabetes (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The induction of hepatic glucose 6-phosphatase (G6pc) by glucose presents a paradox of glucose-induced glucose intolerance. We tested whether glucose regulation of liver gene expression is geared toward intracellular homeostasis.

Research Design and Methods

The effect of glucose-induced accumulation of phosphorylated intermediates on expression of glucokinase (Gck) and its regulator Gckr was determined in hepatocytes. Cell ATP and uric acid production were measured as indices of cell phosphate homeostasis.

Results

Accumulation of phosphorylated intermediates in hepatocytes incubated at elevated glucose induced rapid and inverse changes in Gck (repression) and Gckr (induction) mRNA concomitantly with induction of G6pc, but had slower effects on the Gckr-to-Gck protein ratio. Dynamic metabolic labeling in mice and liver proteome analysis confirmed that Gckr and Gck are low-turnover proteins. Involvement of Max-like protein X in glucose-mediated Gck-repression was confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. Elevation of the Gck-to-Gckr ratio in hepatocytes was associated with glucose-dependent ATP depletion and elevated urate production confirming compromised phosphate homeostasis.

Conclusions

The lowering by glucose of the Gck-to-Gckr ratio provides a potential explanation for the impaired hepatic glucose uptake in diabetes. Elevated uric acid production at an elevated Gck-to-Gckr ratio supports a role for glucose regulation of gene expression in hepatic phosphate homeostasis.

### Effect of canagliflozin on serum uric acid in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus [^113nSpwB]. Diabetes, Obesity & Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Discussion

Canagliflozin decreased serum uric acid levels in patients with T2DM, including a subset of patients with hyperuricaemia. Furthermore, 20–30% of patients with hyperuricaemia were able to achieve normal serum uric acid levels (< 6 mg/dl) with canagliflozin. Previous pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies have shown that this reduction in serum uric acid levels relates to an increased fractional excretion of uric acid during the first weeks of canagliflozin treatment 12. By week 12, the total urinary uric acid excretion returned to near baseline levels, probably reflecting the persistent reduction in serum uric acid concentrations.

The mechanism by which SGLT2 inhibitors reduce serum uric acid has not been established; however, it may possibly involve the renal SLC2A9 (GLUT9) transporter, which is known to exchange glucose for uric acid 13. Higher glucose concentrations in the urine attributable to canagliflozin treatment could lead to an increased exchange of uric acid in the apical membrane of tubular cells. Consequently, this would result in increased release of uric acid from blood into the urine, reducing serum uric acid levels 13. This potential mechanism is supported by evidence of trans‐stimulation of uric acid efflux with high glucose concentrations in Xenopus oocytes expressing SLC2A9b 14.

In conclusion, both doses of canagliflozin reduced serum uric acid levels in patients with T2DM. Furthermore, up to 30% of patients with baseline hyperuricaemia and T2DM achieved normal serum acid levels with canagliflozin after 26 weeks. Whether such changes have other beneficial effects on renal and/or cardiovascular complications will require evaluation in longer‐term studies.

### Sugar, uric acid, and the etiology of diabetes and obesity [^111uxfZa]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Evidence that fructose mediates fatty liver and insulin resistance in humans

The major source of fructose in the Western diet is from soft drinks and fruit drinks, and this accounts for approximately 7% of caloric intake in the adult, and upward to 15% of total caloric intake in adolescents. Intake of sugar and soft drinks are higher in populations at increased risk for insulin resistance and diabetes, including the African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, and subjects with lower income. A meta-analysis concluded that the intake of sugary soft drinks is an independent predictor for the development of metabolic syndrome and/or diabetes. Genetic factors enhance the risk for developing diabetes from soft drinks.

Clinical studies have documented the metabolic effects of fructose. Studies from the 1960s through the 1980s showed that sucrose, or fructose, can worsen hypertriglyceridemia and insulin resistance, especially if subjects were hyperinsulinemic. More recently Stanhope et al. fed 25% of diet as fructose or glucose to overweight individuals for 10 weeks. Although some features of metabolic syndrome were induced with glucose, the fructose-fed subjects showed worse postprandial hypertriglyceridemia, increased hepatic de novo synthesis of fatty acids, a decrease in insulin sensitivity (noted by elevations in fasting glucose and insulin levels), increased total and visceral fat (among men), higher 24-h uric acid levels, increased systemic inflammatory mediators (MCP-1), and lower resting energy expenditure. In another study, Maersk et al. randomized overweight adults to drink 1 L of a sugary soft drink daily for 6 months, with control subjects receiving equivalent amount of diet soft drink, milk, or water. At the end of 6 months, the subjects receiving the sugary soft drinks displayed more visceral, skeletal muscle, and liver fat and higher serum triglycerides and cholesterol compared with the group drinking milk, with a trend toward significance in the other two groups. Tappy and colleagues have also shown the ability of fructose to induce insulin resistance, hepatic lipid accumulation, and hypertriglyceridemia. Similarly, our group administered 200 g fructose to overweight men for 2 weeks and documented higher blood pressure, higher triglycerides, and lower HDL cholesterol compared with baseline, with 25% of the subjects developing de novo metabolic syndrome at 2 weeks. Another study showed that the administration of one 8-oz soft drink per day to adolescents results in increased body weight at 18 months compared with subjects given diet soft drinks.

### Urinary metabolomics provide insights into coronary artery disease in individuals with type 1 diabetes [^11357TBV]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2024). Medium credibility.

Xanthosine– a nucleoside composed of xanthine and ribose– was associated with increased risk of 10-year incident CAD in type 1 diabetes, specifically among individuals with albuminuria. We hypothesize that this observed xanthosine association reflects the purine degradation pathway: More specifically, the metabolism of guanosine monophosphate (GMP) and inosine monophosphate (IMP) to uric acid. IMP is transformed to hypoxanthine, which is further catabolized to uric acid through xanthine by a xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), which simultaneously generates reactive oxygen species. GMP is transformed to guanine, which is also further metabolized to uric acid through xanthine partly by a XOR. Importantly, the reactive oxygen species produced by XOR may lead to oxidative stress and to endothelial dysfunction. The downstream product, uric acid, is commonly elevated in serum of individuals with metabolic syndrome and has been suggested to predict cardiovascular outcomes. In humans, xanthosine can be produced from xanthosine monophosphate (XMP), and xanthosine may be catabolized to xanthine. XMP is an intermediate molecule in IMP conversion to GMP. Further supporting the relevance of the purine degradation pathway, xanthosine linked to glutamine in the case-to-control network comparison. Glutamine is an essential substrate in the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines, and the enzyme converting XMP to GMP requires glutamine in the process. In the correlation networks, xanthosine correlated strongly with arabinose and allantoin. Allantoin, as the product of uric acid oxidative reactions, is considered a marker of oxidative stress in the human urine, suggesting xanthosine to indeed reflect purine degradation and oxidative stress. Targeting this purine degradation pathway, xanthine oxidase inhibitors have already been proposed as a putative drug target for CVD for individuals with related risk factors (e.g. diabetes). In summary, we hypothesize that the association between elevated xanthosine and increased risk of incident CAD reflects purine degradation, the oxidative stress induced by xanthine oxidoreductases, and the subsequent endothelial dysfunction.

### Endogenous toxic metabolites and implications in cancer therapy [^113uh3Gm]. Oncogene (2020). Medium credibility.

Second, a metabolic enzyme that appears to be essential in tissue culture may not end up being essential in a more physiological (in vivo) context, as typical culture media conditions do not accurately reflect the diversity and quantity of metabolites that are available in the human bloodstream. Uric acid, pyruvate, taurine and various other metabolites are present at higher levels in human serum than in culture media. Consequently, disrupting a biosynthetic pathway may sufficiently deprive cells of an essential metabolite in tissue culture, while in vivo the cells may be able to obtain the metabolite from the bloodstream.

As illustrated, there are multiple reasons why targeting a particular enzyme that produces cellular building blocks may not be effective to kill a cancer cell. Thus, even when this enzyme appears to be important to a cancer cell, either due to the product it makes or due to it being increased in expression and/or activity, targeting it may not translate to effective therapy. Here, we outline an alternative approach: the notion of killing cancer cells not by impairing the production of biosynthetic building blocks, but rather by inducing an accumulation of toxic intermediates that lie within metabolic pathways. Assuming a standard linear metabolic pathway that involves the stepwise chemical conversion of a series of metabolites, the loss of an enzyme that converts toxic metabolite "b" to a nontoxic metabolite "c" may result in the accumulation of "b" to toxic levels in the cell (Fig. 1c). This approach may overcome some of the aforementioned limitations of the building block deprivation approach. Even if alternate synthesis or uptake routes exist for the building block synthesis, it cannot remedy the issue of accumulated toxic metabolites. Importantly, if this metabolic pathway is more active in a particular type of cancer cell compared with a normal cell, then the accumulation of "b" should occur at a greater rate in the cancer cell, providing a therapeutic window. The more toxic metabolite "b" is, the more likely it is that the disruption of the downstream enzyme will be detrimental to the cancer cell.

### High plasma uric acid concentration: causes and consequences [^117AWAd9]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2012). Low credibility.

Production control

Purine bases and their nucleotides are rapidly captured by the liver and converted into xanthines, metabolized by uric acid or recycled by salvage pathways or de novo synthesis, and the latter requires a higher energetic cost (ATP consumption). Uric acid formation by xanthine occurs via hypoxanthine by the action of xanthine oxidase. In most mammals, uric acid is converted into allantoin by uricase and later into urea, which are excreted. For this reason, uricemia in these animals corresponds to 10% of human values.

Diseases accompanied by great cell depletion, such as leukemia, leukocytosis and dystrophies can increase the provision of nucleic acids to the liver and result in a larger production of uric acid. Hence, diseases resulting from innate purine metabolic errors may also result in hyperuricemia.

### Dietary fructose and the metabolic syndrome [^117PgdUX]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Fructose, a naturally found sugar in many fruits, is now commonly used as an industrial sweetener and is excessively consumed in Western diets. High fructose intake is increasingly recognized as causative in development of prediabetes and metabolic syndrome. The mechanisms underlying fructose-induced metabolic disturbances are unclear but are beginning to be unravelled. This review presents recent findings in this field and an overall mechanistic insight into the metabolic effects of dietary fructose and its role in metabolic syndrome.

Recent Findings

Recent animal studies have confirmed the link between fructose feeding and increased plasma uric acid, a potentially causative factor in metabolic syndrome. Advanced glycation end products are also implicated because of their direct protein modifications and indirect effects on inflammation and oxidative stress. Human studies have demonstrated fructose's ability to change metabolic hormonal response, possibly contributing to decreased satiety.

Summary

There is much evidence from both animal models and human studies supporting the notion that fructose is a highly lipogenic nutrient that, when consumed in high quantities, contributes to tissue insulin insensitivity, metabolic defects, and the development of a prediabetic state. Recently evidence has helped to decipher the mechanisms involved in these metabolic changes.

### Assessment of the relationship between serum uric acid and glucose levels in healthy, prediabetic and diabetic individuals [^111KiKDL]. Diabetology & Metabolic Syndrome (2019). Medium credibility.

A plausible mechanism for the observed findings of the negative relationship between SUA and diabetes may be related to the inhibition of uric acid reabsorption in the proximal tubule of kidney by high glucose concentrations in diabetic individuals. Studies demonstrated that the net concentration of uric acid in serum depends on its synthesis, secretion and reabsorption in the body. The low concentration of uric acid in serum might be the results of the uricosuric effect of glucose on uric acid which may influence to increase the excretion and decrease reabsorption of uric acid from the kidney. About 70% of the uric acid is excreted through kidney. The exact mechanism is not clear but the proposed mechanism is that the 100% of uric acid is filtered in the glomerulus to the renal tubules with about 80% filtered load reabsorbed. A major percentage of uric acid is reabsorbed by proximal tubules using urate or anion exchanger and a voltage sensitive urate channels. The filtered blood glucose is also reabsorbed in the proximal renal tubes. As both blood glucose and uric acid are reabsorbed at the same site in the kidney, so, blood glucose may affect the uric acid reabsorption. Uric acid is transported by GLUT9 from lumen to proximal tubules and its reabsorption may be affected by several inorganic and organic ions and glucose which results in decline reabsorption and increase excretion of uric acid.

### Metabolic factors mediate the association between serum uric acid to serum creatinine ratio and cardiovascular disease [^116PFLm7]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2021). Medium credibility.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most common cause of death worldwide and a significant contributor to morbidity. In 2017, ≈17.8 million CVD deaths occurred worldwide, corresponding to 330 million years of life lost and another 35.6 million years lived with disability. Reducing the major risk factors for CVD is a major strategy for reducing its prevalence. Therefore, primary prevention of CVD through understanding and reduction of risk factors may have significant implications for public health and clinical practice.

Serum uric acid (SUA), the final oxidation product of purine metabolism, has been shown to be a modifiable risk factor for CVD. However, conflicting data exist. These inconsistencies may be explained by the fact that the concentration of endogenous SUA depends primarily on renal clearance function. Increased SUA often occurs as a consequence of renal dysfunction, although some previous studies have ignored the effect of renal function on SUA. Consequently, renal function‐normalized SUA (the SUA to serum creatinine ratio [SUA/SCr]) has emerged as a new biomarker and is considered a superior indicator of net SUA production. Several studies have suggested that SUA/SCr is significantly associated with several metabolic diseases and mortality. However, evidence on the effect of SUA/SCr on CVD is limited and, to date, the potential pathway linking SUA/SCr to CVD remains incompletely characterized. SUA/SCr was confirmed to be associated with various cardiometabolic factors, which raised the question as to whether SUA/SCr can lead directly to the outcome of CVD, or if cardiometabolic factors, such as indicators of obesity, blood glucose, blood lipids, blood pressure, and indicators of inflammation play potentially mediating roles in the association between SUA/SCr and CVD.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the association between SUA/SCr and CVD and, using mediation analysis, assess whether and to what extent the association is mediated by cardiometabolic factors.

Fructose-induced metabolic syndrome does not require increased energy intake

The ability for fructose (and sucrose, which contains fructose) to stimulate food intake and to lower metabolism provides a mechanism for how a high fructose intake may encourage weight gain and visceral fat accumulation. However, fructose or sucrose also alters fat stores and metabolism independent of excessive energy intake. Although weight gain is largely controlled by overall energy intake, other features of metabolic syndrome can occur independent of weight gain. For example, rats fed fructose develop fatty liver, hypertriglyceridemia, and insulin resistance when compared with rats fed isocaloric glucose or starch-enriched diets. Indeed, hypertriglyceridemia, fatty liver, and type 2 diabetes can be induced in metabolic syndrome–prone rats with caloric restriction provided the diet is high (40%) in sucrose (which contains fructose). A recent epidemiological analysis in humans also found an association of diabetes prevalence with sugar availability that was independent of total energy intake.

### Food sources of fructose-containing sugars and glycaemic control: systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled intervention studies [^115DvQaZ]. BMJ (2018). Excellent credibility.

The increase in insulin in the absence of a harmful effect on HBA1c or fasting blood glucose with sweetened low fat milk in the substitution studies could relate to an isolated insulinotropic effect of dairy proteins. The ability of protein, especially dairy proteins, co-ingested with carbohydrate to stimulate glucose stimulated insulin secretion has been well described. This isolated finding does not necessarily imply harm, because fasting glucose was not increased and sweetened and unsweetened low fat dairy, especially in the form of yogurt, is associated with decreased risk of weight gain and diabetes incidence.

By contrast, the observed harmful effects of food sources of fructose-containing sugars on glycaemic control in addition studies seem to be largely driven by the energy contribution of the sugars. Fructose-containing sugars supplementing diets with excess calories could promote ectopic weight gain, contributing to downstream insulin resistance and impaired glycaemic control. Related effects have been reported in systematic reviews and meta-analyses of controlled intervention studies of fructose overfeeding for body weight, blood pressure, uric acid levels, markers of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and postprandial triglycerides. Although fructose has been proposed to increase de novo lipogenesis more than other carbohydrates (owing to fructose's ability to enter glycolysis as an unregulated substrate), leading to weight gain and its downstream cardiometabolic disturbances, this mechanism has been shown to be a minor pathway for fructose disposal. The mechanism is also not unique to fructose-containing sugars, and weight gain with metabolic disturbances would be expected for the overconsumption of food sources of other dietary macronutrients.

The lack of a protective effect of interventions to reduce excess energy from food sources of fructose-containing sugars in subtraction studies is unclear. It could represent compensation, in which the decrease in energy from food sources of these sugars are compensated by replacement with energy from other food sources or spontaneous changes in physical activity that decrease energy expenditure, preventing weight loss and its downstream metabolic benefits. Compensation might have been more apparent in these studies because they had the longest median follow-up (12 weeks), and might explain why longer term subtraction studies (with median follow-up of roughly one year) designed to displace excess energy from SSBs have only shown a weight loss benefit in specific subgroups of overweight or obese individuals. The instability in the significance of the pooled effect estimates might have also had a role. Removal of the Campos study (group 2)explained the heterogeneity showing significant beneficial effects on fasting insulin, suggesting that this study might have masked a true benefit of interventions to reduce fructose-containing sugars.

### Hyperuricemia-induced kidney injury: a narrative review of mechanisms and therapeutic advances [^117DxTBv]. BMC Nephrology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Uric acid (2,6,8-trioxypurine, molecular formula C 5 H 4 N 4 O 3; UA) is the final product of endogenous and exogenous purine metabolism, primarily synthesized in the liver. Hyperuricemia (HUA) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by increased serum UA levels, arises from an imbalance between UA production and excretion. Intrinsic causes of HUA include overproduction of UA due to increased purine metabolism and impaired renal or intestinal UA excretion, often linked to genetic predispositions or renal tubular dysfunction. Liver damage, such as that seen in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or hepatitis, can exacerbate HUA by impairing hepatic UA metabolism or altering xanthine oxidase activity, potentially leading to further increases in circulating UA levels. Extensive clinical studies have demonstrated that HUA serves as a fundamental pathological condition associated with certain metabolic diseases, including chronic kidney disease (CKD), gout, cardiovascular disease, and hyperglycemia. Notably, HUA shares a bidirectional relationship with hyperglycemia, as elevated UA levels can induce insulin resistance, while hyperglycemia may enhance UA production through increased purine catabolism. HUA has also been identified as an independent risk factor for the development and progression of CKD. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of HUA-related kidney injury and advances in therapeutic interventions is crucial for preventing and delaying the onset of CKD. In this review, we focus on the potential mechanisms of HUA-induced kidney injury and summarize recent advances in improving renal damage. These insights may provide a useful reference for future research on HUA-induced kidney injury and the development of potential therapeutic strategies.

Pathomechanisms in hyperuricemia-induced kidney injury

Hyperuricemia (HUA) -induced kidney damage involves complex mechanisms, including urate crystal deposition, inflammatory reactions, endothelial dysfunction, renal fibrosis, and dysbiosis of the gut microbiota. Among these, the deposition of urate crystals is the most direct form of injury, as they form stones in renal tissues, obstructing the ureters and leading to renal impairment. Additionally, HUA may exacerbate renal damage through various mechanisms such as activating the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, and increasing oxidative stress. It is worth noting that although HUA has become an important risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), its early diagnosis and treatment still pose challenges. Therefore, a thorough exploration of the mechanisms by which HUA causes kidney damage and its impact on CKD is crucial for the development of new treatment strategies.

### Uric acid-induced pancreatic β-cell dysfunction [^115VJhfD]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Worldwide, the prevalence of diabetes is about 8–9% and its incidence varies between 2.9 and 23.5 per 1000 population. The worldwide prevalence of gout, defined as deposition of monosodium urate crystals mostly in the peripheral joints, ranges from 0.1 to 10%, and its incidence varies 0.3 to 6 per 1000 person-years. Both prevalence and incidence of diabetes are higher in patients with gout.

Uric acid (UA) is the end product of exogenous and endogenous purine (adenine and guanine) metabolism. The liver and the intestine are the major sites of endogenous UA production, which is about 300–400 mg/day. Dietary contribution is approximately 300 mg/day with a total pool size of 1200 mg in men and 600 mg in women. UA homeostasis depends on a balance between production and catabolism, where 20–40% of UA is excreted by the gastrointestinal tract and 60–80% by the kidneys. Secreted UA by the intestine is further metabolized by the gut bacteria (intestinal uricolysis). UA is freely filtrated by the kidneys, of the filtrated load (plasma concentration of UA × glomerular filtration rate), 90% is reabsorbed and therefore, fractional excretion of UA is about 10% (7–12%). Physiological functions of UA include but not limited to antioxidant property, defense against neurological diseases, autoimmune diseases, and maintaining endothelial function.
