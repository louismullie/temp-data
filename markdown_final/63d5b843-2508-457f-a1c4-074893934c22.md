## Question

Treatment for SIADH

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how to treat SIADH. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and excluding mimics. Then, I should determine symptom severity and chronicity to triage urgency. Next, I'll identify and address the underlying cause while selecting first-line therapy, followed by evidence-based second-line options. After that, I need to set correction-rate limits and outline overcorrection management. Finally, I'll consider special scenarios and practical monitoring parameters, anchoring the flow to high-credibility guidelines and recent reviews.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis of SIADH carefully, because misclassification drives harm; I need to verify hypotonic hyponatremia with effective serum osmolality less than 275 mOsm/kg, inappropriately concentrated urine above 100 mOsm/kg, clinical euvolemia, urine sodium above 30 mmol/L on normal salt intake, and exclusion of adrenal, thyroid, renal insufficiency, and recent diuretic use, while remembering that guidelines advise against measuring vasopressin for diagnosis [^115cSj3z] [^117VQ1wD]. Hold on, I should also consider mimics such as renal or cerebral salt wasting when the volume assessment is unreliable, using uric acid and fractional excretion of urate judiciously to avoid mislabeling salt wasting as SIADH, since treatment directions are opposite [^112ndk8z] [^113VBoKn].

> Next, I should review clinical severity and timing because this dictates initial therapy; I need to check whether symptoms are severe, such as seizures, coma, or signs of life-threatening cerebral edema, in which case hypertonic 3% saline is indicated immediately irrespective of chronicity, preferably with a bolus strategy and close ICU-level monitoring [^115EBSx5] [^111WX8Kf]. Wait, let's not jump to conclusions; for moderate symptoms or profound hyponatremia without severe features, a more conservative approach is appropriate, while for mild or asymptomatic cases, I can proceed with first-line fluid restriction alongside close monitoring of sodium trajectories [^115EBSx5].

> Concurrently, I will now examine the underlying cause, because removing the stimulus for inappropriate AVP is the most effective and definitive therapy; I should double-check for malignancy such as small-cell lung cancer, pulmonary or CNS disease, and especially drugs including SSRIs/SNRIs, linezolid, and even thiazolidinediones like rosiglitazone, and stop the offending agent when feasible [^115EBSx5] [^115GEEFh] [^113Gn64Y] [^111KEq8y]. But wait, what if multiple drivers coexist; in that case, I need to prioritize reversible contributors first and reassess sodium after dechallenge to avoid overtreatment with aquaretics [^115EBSx5].

> For first-line therapy, let me verify fluid restriction parameters, since guidelines recommend fluid intake restriction as initial management in moderate or profound SIADH; typical targets are about 1 liter per day, and an RCT showed a median 3 mmol/L sodium rise by day 3 with minimal additional gain by day 30, highlighting both early modest efficacy and the frequent need to escalate when response is inadequate [^113PdLtM] [^116qJhh9]. Hmm, wait a minute, adherence and thirst limit tolerability, and the osmotic threshold for thirst is lower in chronic SIADH, so I should ensure patient education and realistic timelines before deciding FR has failed [^114MVSuY].

> If FR is inadequate after 48–72 hours or poorly tolerated, I should review second-line options beginning with urea, because guidelines endorse increasing solute intake; dosing is typically 0.25–0.50 g/kg/day, and a recent meta-analysis suggests a roughly 9 mmol/L mean sodium increase, with low overcorrection risk and low cost, although heterogeneity and observational designs temper certainty [^114aNjKF] [^112MGZPb]. Hold on, I should verify alternative adjuncts; loop diuretic combined with oral sodium chloride can increase solute delivery and free water clearance, but prospective evidence is limited, so I would reserve it for selected patients with careful monitoring of volume status and electrolytes [^112MGZPb].

> Now, regarding tolvaptan as a V2 antagonist, I need to ensure its use is targeted and monitored; SALT-1/2 established efficacy with about a 4 mmol/L rise by day 4 versus roughly 1 mmol/L with placebo, with a starting dose of 15 mg daily and uptitration to 30–60 mg if response is under 5 mmol/L at 24 hours, although participants with Na less than 120 mmol/L plus neurological impairment were excluded [^115EBSx5]. I should confirm real-world safety; registries show higher overcorrection rates, around 12% and up to 24%, especially when baseline sodium is under 120 mmol/L, supporting inpatient initiation, sodium checks every 4–6 hours for the first 24 hours, avoidance of concurrent fluid restriction, and consideration of lower starting doses such as 7.5 mg in select patients to mitigate risk, though evidence for ultra-low dosing remains limited and does not eliminate overcorrection risk [^1126CSdP] [^115KMrVW] [^1112hMeE]. Wait, let me verify practical pitfalls; profound aquaresis and hypotension can occur at 15 mg in sensitive patients, so I should be prepared to pause therapy, administer free water, or use desmopressin if the sodium rise is too rapid [^113QnQQS] [^115KMrVW].

> I will also consider SGLT2 inhibitors as an emerging adjunct in select inpatient cases; a randomized trial of empagliflozin 25 mg added to 1000 mL/day fluid restriction increased sodium by about 10 mmol/L over 4 days versus 7 mmol/L with placebo, with a small overcorrection signal, but this remains investigational and not standard of care pending broader evidence [^111af2Rz]. Hold on, I should verify comorbidities and renal function before selecting this approach, given transient declines in eGFR and the need for inpatient monitoring [^111af2Rz].

> I need to ensure the correction rate stays within safe limits to prevent osmotic demyelination; the general target is no more than 8–10 mmol/L per 24 hours, and if the sodium rise outpaces targets, I should stop active therapy, give electrolyte-free water such as IV 5% dextrose with a 10 mL/kg bolus over 1 hour, and consider desmopressin 1–2 mcg IV or subcutaneously to halt aquaresis, with frequent reassessment and laboratory checks until back under the 24-hour limit [^115EBSx5] [^11167oaL] [^113Ucrn6]. Hold on, I should verify whether a proactive desmopressin strategy is warranted; while some advocate early coadministration with hypertonic saline to tightly control the correction rate, evidence is limited and uncontrolled, and it may prolong hyponatremia if antidiuresis persists, so I would reserve it for highly selected scenarios with expert oversight [^115eEJTN].

> Let me think about special scenarios because context shifts management; in chronic SIADH requiring maintenance after FR failure, urea is a practical long-term option, and tolvaptan can be used intermittently with daily review to minimize overcorrection risk and drug exposure, whereas postoperative SIADH often resolves within one to three weeks and may be managed conservatively while monitoring for spontaneous improvement, and paraneoplastic SIADH may remit once the malignancy is treated, with aquaretics or urea bridging symptoms during oncologic therapy [^115EBSx5] [^111tY5vT] [^111ZUk49] [^114rePbs]. I should double-check for relapse triggers and reassess the need for ongoing therapy as the underlying driver evolves to avoid overtreatment [^115EBSx5].

> Finally, I should confirm operational safeguards; initiate hypertonic saline for severe symptoms with rapid neurologic stabilization targets and frequent sodium checks, start tolvaptan in an inpatient setting with sodium monitoring every 4–6 hours during the first 24 hours, avoid combining tolvaptan with fluid restriction to reduce overcorrection risk, and when using FR alone, reassess after 48–72 hours to decide on escalation while continually searching for and removing reversible causes [^115EBSx5] [^1126CSdP]. I need to ensure that each adjustment is followed by timely labs and that the cumulative 24-hour correction stays within the safety envelope, ready to relower promptly if the trajectory exceeds targets [^115EBSx5] [^113Ucrn6].

The cornerstone of SIADH management is **fluid restriction** [^113PdLtM] (800–1,200 mL/day) [^112MGZPb] as first-line therapy for chronic, asymptomatic, or mildly symptomatic hyponatremia. For acute or severe symptomatic hyponatremia, use **hypertonic saline** (3% NaCl) [^115EBSx5] with careful monitoring to avoid overcorrection [^111WX8Kf]. If fluid restriction fails, consider second-line options [^112MGZPb]: oral urea (0.25–0.5 g/kg/day) [^114aNjKF], loop diuretics with salt tablets [^112MGZPb], or vasopressin receptor antagonists (tolvaptan) [^1126CSdP]. Always identify and treat the underlying cause [^112xMY7y], monitor serum sodium closely [^115EBSx5], and limit correction to ≤ 10 mmol/L in 24 hours to prevent osmotic demyelination [^111WX8Kf].

---

## General principles of management

Identify and treat **underlying causes**, such as malignancy, CNS or pulmonary disease, or offending drugs [^112xMY7y]. Monitor **serum sodium** closely, with checks every 2–4 hours initially [^111WX8Kf], then daily once stable. Avoid **rapid correction** [^115EBSx5] by limiting the rise to ≤ 10 mmol/L within 24 hours to prevent osmotic demyelination [^112MGZPb].

---

## First-line treatment: fluid restriction

Fluid restriction is the **primary therapy** for chronic, asymptomatic, or mildly symptomatic SIADH [^113PdLtM].

- **Recommended fluid intake**: 800–1,200 mL/day [^113PdLtM] [^112MGZPb].

- **Efficacy**: Modest early rise in sodium [^116qJhh9]; about one-third do not reach ≥ 130 mmol/L after 3 days.

- **Limitations**: Poor adherence, thirst [^114MVSuY], and limited efficacy in severe hyponatremia [^115EBSx5].

---

## Second-line treatments

If **fluid restriction is ineffective or poorly tolerated**, consider:

| **Treatment** | **Mechanism** | **Dose** | **Efficacy** | **Limitations** |
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Urea | Osmotic diuresis | 0.25–0.5 g/kg/day [^112MGZPb] | - Effective <br/> - Sodium rise in 24–48 h [^114aNjKF] | - Taste <br/> - GI upset |
| Loop diuretics + salt | - Block Na-K-2Cl <br/> - Replace Na | Furosemide 20–40 mg + NaCl 9 g/day [^112MGZPb] | - Effective <br/> - Sodium rise in 24–48 h | - Hypokalemia <br/> - Volume depletion |
| Tolvaptan | V2 antagonist | 7.5–15 mg/day | - Rapid sodium rise [^1126CSdP] <br/> - Effective | - Overcorrection [^115KMrVW] <br/> - Hepatotoxicity <br/> - Cost [^112xMY7y] |

---

## Management of acute or severe symptomatic hyponatremia

Acute or severe symptomatic hyponatremia (e.g. seizures or coma) **requires urgent correction**.

- **Hypertonic saline (3% NaCl)**: 100 mL bolus over 10 minutes; repeat up to three times to achieve 4–6 mmol/L rise [^115EBSx5].

- **Monitoring**: Check sodium every 2 hours [^115EBSx5]; avoid > 10 mmol/L rise in 24 hours [^111WX8Kf].

- **Desmopressin**: Consider to prevent overcorrection in high-risk patients [^115EBSx5] [^115eEJTN].

---

## Long-term management and prevention of recurrence

Address **underlying causes** by treating malignancy, CNS or pulmonary disease, or discontinuing offending drugs [^112xMY7y]. Provide **patient education** on fluid restriction, symptom recognition, and adherence. Monitor **serum sodium** regularly and adjust therapy to maintain 135–145 mmol/L [^114oZizi].

---

## Potential complications and side effects

- **Osmotic demyelination syndrome**: From rapid correction; limit to ≤ 10 mmol/L in 24 hours [^115EBSx5] [^111WX8Kf].

- **Overcorrection**: Risk with tolvaptan [^1126CSdP] and hypertonic saline; monitor closely [^115EBSx5].

- **Medication side effects**: Tolvaptan (hepatotoxicity, thirst) [^112xMY7y], urea (GI upset) [^114aNjKF], loop diuretics (hypokalemia).

---

## Emerging therapies and recent advances

**SGLT2 inhibitors**, such as empagliflozin [^111af2Rz], produce a modest sodium rise but require further study. **Proactive desmopressin**, administered early alongside hypertonic saline, may help control the correction rate [^115eEJTN]. **Lower-dose tolvaptan (7.5 mg)** may reduce the risk of overcorrection, though more data are needed [^1112hMeE].

---

Fluid restriction is **first-line** [^112MGZPb] for SIADH, with **hypertonic saline** [^115EBSx5] for acute or severe cases. Second-line options include **urea, loop diuretics with salt, and tolvaptan** [^1126CSdP]. Identify and treat **underlying causes**, monitor sodium closely, and avoid rapid correction to prevent complications [^111WX8Kf].

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis [^112xMY7y]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2025). Low credibility.

Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD), the most frequent cause of hypotonic hyponatremia, is mediated by nonosmotic release of arginine vasopressin, which promotes water retention by activating renal vasopressin type 2 (V2) receptors. There are numerous causes of SIAD, including malignancy, pulmonary and central nervous system diseases, and medications. Rare activating mutations of the V2 receptor can also cause SIAD. Determination of the etiology of SIAD is important because removal of the stimulus for inappropriate arginine vasopressin secretion offers the most effective therapy.

Treatment of SIAD is guided by symptoms and their severity, as well as the level of plasma sodium. In the absence of severe symptoms, which require urgent intervention, many clinicians focus on fluid restriction as a first-line treatment. Second-line therapeutic options include loop diuretics and salt tablets, urea, and V2 receptor antagonists.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^115EBSx5]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

The efficacy of tolvaptan vs. placebo in raising serum sodium was established in the SALT-1 and SALT-2 trials. These studies recruited 448 participants with a mean age of 61 years. The two trials had an identical design (one conducted at 50 international sites and the other at 42 US sites), enrolling patients with chronic mild-to-moderate hyponatremia, mean baseline serum sodium 129 mmol/L (SD 4.1), who were electively admitted to the hospital for trial initiation. Euvolemic and hypervolemic patients were both enrolled: 30.8% had heart failure, 26.8% had cirrhosis, 24.6% had SIAD, and 17.8% had "other" conditions. These trials compared 30 days of tolvaptan or placebo in addition to standard care (fluid intake recommendations as per treating clinician: no protocolized fluid restriction). Both trials demonstrated greater improvement in their primary endpoint of serum sodium area under the curve (AUC) with tolvaptan by day 4 (∼4 mmol/L) than with placebo (∼1 mmol/L). The initial dose of tolvaptan was 15 mg daily, with uptitration to 30 mg or 60 mg daily if there was limited response (< 5 mmol/L increase in plasma sodium). Participants with plasma sodium less than 120 mmol/L "in association with neurological impairment" were excluded. Adverse effect rates were similar between the two groups, the most common being thirst, dry mouth, weakness, nausea, dizziness, and urinary frequency.

Tolvaptan was approved in the United States and Europe in 2009; then Japan, Taiwan, and Hong Kong in 2010; Canada, China, Indonesia, and Korea in 2011; and Australia in 2012. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval formed a template for…

### Rapidity of correction of hyponatremia due to syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone following tolvaptan [^117CyYR1]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2018). Low credibility.

Tolvaptan effectively corrects hyponatremia due to the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), but undesired overcorrection can occur. We hypothesized that pretherapy parameters can predict the rapidity of response to tolvaptan in SIADH.

- **Study design**: Multicenter historical cohort study.

- **Setting & participants**: Adults with SIADH or congestive heart failure (CHF) treated with tolvaptan for a serum sodium concentration ≤ 130 mEq/L at 5 US hospitals.

- **Predictors**: Demographic and laboratory parameters.

- **Outcomes**: Rate of change in serum sodium concentration.

- **Measurements**: Spearman correlations, analysis of variance, and multivariable linear mixed-effects models.

Results revealed that 28 patients with SIADH and 39 patients with CHF treated with tolvaptan (mean baseline serum sodium, 120.6 and 122.4 mEq/L, respectively) were studied. Correction of serum sodium concentration > 12 mEq/L/d occurred in 25% of patients with SIADH compared to 3% of those with CHF (P < 0.001). Among patients with SIADH, the increase in serum sodium over 24 hours was correlated with baseline serum sodium concentration (r = -0.78; P < 0.001), serum urea nitrogen concentration (SUN; r = -0.76; P < 0.001), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (r = 0.58; P = 0.01). Baseline serum sodium and SUN concentrations were identified as independent predictors of change in serum sodium concentration in multivariable analyses. When patients were grouped into four categories according to baseline serum sodium and SUN median values, those with both low baseline serum sodium (≤ 121 mEq/L) and low baselin

### Normouricemia in the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion [^117C6YeV]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2001). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is observed in 40% to 60% of hospitalized acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients. The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and volume contraction are the most common causes. The serum uric acid level can be used to distinguish between these two causes of hyponatremia. Hypouricemia is typically seen in SIADH, whereas hyperuricemia commonly accompanies volume contraction. This report presents an AIDS patient with SIADH and normouricemia secondary to pyrazinamide and ethambutol.

Abnormalities of micturition occur in many various diseases, with a variety of causes and forms. This review will focus exclusively on those abnormalities in which antidiuretic therapy may be of benefit. These conditions are primarily characterized by an increase in the total amount of urine produced (polyuria) or a circadian shift in the control of urine production and/or voiding, such as nocturnal enuresis and nocturia.

### Tolvaptan for the treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^1119qmWX]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

The fourth question, regarding the optimal tolvaptan dose, remains topical as it has only been addressed in retrospective studies with small cohorts. Criticism has been raised that tolvaptan, initiated at the approved dose of 15 mg, can often lead to overly rapid sodium correction through profound aquaresis. This raises the question of whether tolvaptan may, in some cases, act as 'a cannon rather than a magic bullet' and highlights the need for a precision low-caliber weapon to effectively and safely treat hyponatremia.

For this reason, large prospective studies are needed to compare the efficacy and safety of lower tolvaptan doses, such as 7.5 mg and 3.75 mg, with the 'approved' starting dose of 15 mg across different levels of baseline hyponatremia.

### A case report of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion with Castleman's disease and lymphoma [^111ZUk49]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

After the diagnosis of lymphoma was established, the patient was transferred to the Department of Hematology for further treatment. For the etiology treatment of B-cell lymphoma, chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, oncovin, and prednisone (CHOP), along with rituximab (a monoclonal antibody against the protein CD20), was administered. The patient's serum sodium level stabilized without fluid restriction.

### A case report of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion with Castleman's disease and lymphoma [^114rePbs]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is caused by the excessive release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH, also known as vasopressin) from the posterior pituitary gland and can cause hyponatremia in hospitalized patients, with an incidence as high as 30%. SIADH is typically seen in patients diagnosed with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), which was first described by Schwartz et al. in two patients with lung cancer.

SIADH is not difficult to diagnose in clinical settings. It can be secondary to various disorders, such as medications, malignancies, surgery, and HIV infection, or it can be idiopathic. While SCLC is the primary malignancy causing SIADH, lymphoma can also induce this condition. In this report, the diagnosis of Castleman's disease was established before we suspected SIADH was caused by a malignancy. After extensive examinations, we made the final diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Chemotherapy treatment was recommended for the patient and significantly ameliorated the SIADH symptoms.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^111af2Rz]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), approved for the treatment of diabetes and heart failure, may be beneficial in the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD). The SGLT2 in the proximal renal tubule is responsible for 90% of renal glucose resorption and 65% of sodium resorption. Inhibition of SGLT2 leads to glycosuria, accompanied by osmotic diuresis. Due to the increased free water excretion, SGLT2is have been investigated in SIAD as a novel therapy.

A randomized trial of 87 inpatients with SIAD compared 4 days of empagliflozin 25 mg or placebo, in addition to 1000-mL fluid restriction (FR), in patients with a mean baseline plasma sodium (pNa) of 125.5 mmol/L. Plasma sodium increased by 10 mmol/L over 4 days in the empagliflozin plus FR group, compared to 7 mmol/L with placebo and FR (P = 0.04). Comorbid type 2 diabetes mellitus was present in 14% of participants, equal between empagliflozin and placebo arms. Overcorrection of plasma sodium occurred in 2 patients in the empagliflozin arm (5%), compared to 1 in the placebo arm. The only other potentially related adverse event was decreased renal function in 7% of empagliflozin participants, which later resolved. There was no hypotension or hypoglycemia observed.

The relatively high sodium increment in the placebo group (i.e. FR alone) suggests that at least in some patients, reversible stimuli to arginine vasopressin (AVP) secretion may have been present. It is worth noting that the causes of SIAD were unbalanced between the two groups; thus, the rates of autocorrection may have differed. However, the higher rate of malignancy (a nonreversible stimulus) in the SGLT2i group would, if anything, be expected to bias the response.

### Diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia: Expert panel recommendations [^111WX8Kf]. The American Journal of Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is a serious but often overlooked electrolyte imbalance that has been independently associated with a wide range of deleterious changes involving many different body systems. Untreated acute hyponatremia can cause substantial morbidity and mortality as a result of osmotically induced cerebral edema. Excessively rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can cause severe neurologic impairment and death due to osmotic demyelination.

The diverse etiologies and comorbidities associated with hyponatremia pose substantial challenges in managing this disorder. In 2007, a panel of experts in hyponatremia convened to develop the "Hyponatremia Treatment Guidelines 2007: Expert Panel Recommendations" that defined strategies for clinicians caring for patients with hyponatremia. In the six years since the publication of that document, the field has seen several notable developments, including new evidence on morbidities and complications associated with hyponatremia, the importance of treating mild to moderate hyponatremia, and the efficacy and safety of vasopressin receptor antagonist therapy for hyponatremic patients.

Therefore, additional guidance was deemed necessary, and a panel of hyponatremia experts (including all the original panel members) was convened to update the previous recommendations for the optimal management of this disorder. The updated expert panel recommendations in this document represent recommended approaches for multiple etiologies of hyponatremia based on the consensus opinions of experts in the field and the most recent evidence.

### Tolvaptan for the treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^1126CSdP]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). High credibility.

Real-world data on the effectiveness and safety of tolvaptan use, and predictors for the rapidity of hyponatraemia correction, are essential for understanding its application in clinical settings. The Hyponatraemia Registry, the largest observational study in this field, examined the effectiveness and safety of various treatment modalities for a serum sodium level ≤ 130 mmol/liter in diverse real-life settings, both in the United States and Europe. Real-world data analysis of 225 tolvaptan-treated SIAD patients, with median baseline serum sodium levels of 127 mmol/liter, recorded a median first 24-hour sodium change of 4 mmol/liter following tolvaptan initiation.

The effectiveness of tolvaptan was similar to that of hypertonic saline and superior to fluid restriction. Tolvaptan was also significantly more successful compared with all other therapies for achieving correction benchmarks, such as a sodium level increase of at least 5 mmol/liter (78% success rate), final serum sodium ⩾130 mmol/liter (74%), and sodium ⩾ 135 mmol/liter (40%). Overly rapid correction of hyponatraemia occurred in 12.1% of tolvaptan-treated patients, with both the magnitude of correction and the rate of overly rapid sodium rise being higher than in RCTs. Notably, the patients at greatest risk for unduly rapid sodium correction were those with severe baseline hyponatraemia, especially those with a sodium concentration < 120 mmol/liter.

Subsequently, a retrospective study of 61 tolvaptan-treated SIAD patients, with a mean starting sodium level of 119.9 mmol/liter, reported a mean first-day sodium increase of 9 mmol/liter and an unprecedented rate of overly rapid correction of 23%.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^112wNUbn]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

SIAD has been classified into several distinct pathophysiological categories based on the evaluation of AVP concentrations. This classification was pioneered by Zerbe and colleagues, who measured AVP concentration before and after raising the serum osmolality with hypertonic saline in patients with SIAD. They identified four patterns of AVP response, known as types A to D. These phenotypes correlate with certain etiologies; however, whether the categories are clinically meaningful or simply a vehicle for better understanding pathophysiology is less clear.

- **Type A**: This refers to a persistently raised AVP concentration regardless of an increase in serum osmolality. It occurs in the most common forms of SIAD due to ongoing "inappropriate" AVP secretion, either from the pituitary or a paraneoplastic source.

- **Type B**: Characterized by a lower osmotic threshold for AVP secretion ("reset osmostat"), with serum sodium typically stably maintained at a lower level of 125 to 135 mmol/L. In this pattern, AVP will still suppress at lower osmolarities than this, unless another intercurrent pathology occurs. This pattern may be more common in older age.

- **Rarer patterns**:
	- **Type C**: Characterized by an abnormal AVP response only at low osmolalities, potentially due to dysfunction of inhibitory neurons in the hypothalamus.
	- **Type D**: In this pattern, AVP is undetectable, either because of secretion of an unidentified antidiuretic substance from tumor cells or, alternatively, a gain-of-function mutation in the V2 receptor (i.e. nephrogenic SIAD).

More recently, the same patterns have been shown for copeptin.

### Tolvaptan for the management of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion: Lessons learned in titration of dose [^113QnQQS]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

To report a patient with idiopathic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) who developed profound aquaresis with symptomatic extracellular fluid depletion after initiation of therapy with tolvaptan. The patient was later successfully treated with smaller doses of compounded tolvaptan to prevent rapid correction of serum sodium.

- **Methods**: Case report and review of the literature.

- **Results**: A 51-year-old woman was diagnosed with SIADH during admission for elective surgery, resulting in multiple complications. The patient failed multiple therapies, including fluid restriction, salt tablets, and demeclocycline, and was admitted to the hospital for initiation of tolvaptan therapy. After a 15-mg dose of tolvaptan, the patient experienced a rapid increase in urine output and symptomatic hypotension. Sodium levels corrected rapidly overnight from 126 mEq/L to 139 mEq/L. A lower dose of tolvaptan resulted in similar symptoms and sodium correction. Due to continuing symptoms of hyponatremia, including headaches, nausea, vomiting, and paresthesias after reinitiation of fluid restriction and salt tablets, tolvaptan was compounded to continue titration at lower doses. The patient was then admitted, and tolvaptan was initiated at a dose of 1.5 mg with no significant improvement in sodium levels. Tolvaptan was titrated to 3 mg, which resulted in correction of sodium to 129 mEq/L with no associated symptoms of hypovolemia.

- **Conclusions**: Tolvaptan should be initiated in an inpatient setting with close monitoring of serum sodium levels.

### Fluid restriction therapy for chronic SIAD; results of a prospective randomized controlled trial [^116qJhh9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). High credibility.

Fluid restriction (FR) is the recommended first-line treatment for syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD), despite the lack of prospective data to support its efficacy.

- **Design**: A prospective non-blinded randomized controlled trial of FR versus no treatment in chronic SIAD.

- **Interventions and outcome**: A total of 46 patients with chronic asymptomatic SIAD were randomized to either FR (1 liter/day) or no specific hyponatremia treatment (NoTx) for 1 month. The primary endpoints were change in plasma sodium concentration (pNa) at days 4 and 30.

- **Results**: Median baseline pNa was similar in the two groups [127 mmol/L (interquartile range 126–129) for FR and 128 mmol/L (IQR 126–129) for NoTx, P = 0.36]. PNa rose by 3 mmol/L (IQR 2–4) after 3 days of FR, compared with 1 mmol/L (IQR 0–3) for NoTx, P = 0.005. There was minimal additional rise in pNa by day 30; median pNa increased from baseline by 4 mmol/L (IQR 2–6) in FR, compared with 1 mmol/L (IQR 0–1) in NoTx, P = 0.04. After 3 days, 17% of the FR group had a rise in pNa of ≥ 5 mmol/L, compared with 4% in NoTx, RR 4.0 (95% CI 0.66–25.69), P = 0.35. After 3 days, 61% of the FR group corrected pNa to ≥ 130 mmol/L, compared with 39% of NoTx, RR 1.56 (95% CI 0.87–2.94), P = 0.24.

FR induces a modest early rise in pNa in patients with chronic SIAD, with minimal additional rise thereafter, and it is well-tolerated. More than one-third of patients fail to reach a pNa ≥ 130 mmol/L after 3 days of FR, emphasizing the clinical need for additional therapies for SIAD in some patients.

### Severe hyponatremia due to rosiglitazone use in an elderly woman with diabetes mellitus: A rare cause of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion [^111KEq8y]. Endocrine Practice (2008). Low credibility.

To describe the first case of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion with life-threatening hyponatremia due to rosiglitazone therapy, we conducted a clinical study examining the patient's clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings.

An 89-year-old woman with a 5-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus was admitted to the emergency department due to unconsciousness. She had experienced generalized weakness for 15 days and nausea and vomiting for 3 days. Laboratory analysis revealed severe hyponatremia with a sodium level of 110 mEq/L. The patient had normal renal, cardiac, and adrenal function and did not exhibit edema or volume depletion. The hyponatremia was attributed to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. No other cause was identified apart from rosiglitazone, an antihyperglycemic drug increasingly used in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. According to her medical history, rosiglitazone was prescribed 1 month previously after the withdrawal of gliclazide.

We discontinued the rosiglitazone and treated the hyponatremia with hypertonic saline infusion. The saline infusion was halted once blood sodium levels stabilized within the normal range after 2 days. The patient's plasma sodium concentration has remained within the reference range at follow-up visits.

This case is the first reported instance of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion as an adverse effect of rosiglitazone, suggesting that this drug should be considered for inclusion on the list of drugs that can cause this condition.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^115KMrVW]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Postapproval observational studies of tolvaptan have reported efficacy in hospitalized patients with lower serum sodium concentrations than the SALT trials but have identified potential risks. While the SALT trials reported excessively rapid correction of hyponatremia (defined as an increase in sodium > 12 mmol in 24 hours) in 1.7% of overall tolvaptan-treated patients (5.6% in the SIAD subgroup), observational studies of tolvaptan in moderate to profound hyponatremia have reported highly variable rates of biochemical overcorrection (variably defined, usually ≥ 12 mmol/L over 24 hours) in patients with initial pNa less than 125 mmol/L, ranging from 0% to 30% of cases. The largest data sets are an international hyponatremia registry that included 225 patients with SIAD treated with tolvaptan, which observed overcorrection (pNa > 12 mmol/L in 24 hours) in 12.1% of cases, and an international pharmacovigilance study of 252 tolvaptan-treated patients that observed overcorrection in 24.6% of cases. One reason for the higher rates of overcorrection in clinical practice compared to the SALT trials may be that in clinical practice, tolvaptan is used second-line, which selects for patients with more severe SIAD. Some of these studies describe use that differs from standard practice, including combining tolvaptan with FR or the concurrent use of additional therapies. Higher rates still of overcorrection are reported in observational studies in which tolvaptan has been used in less highly selected patient groups, including those likely to contain participants with acute hyponatremia.

### Clinical management of SIADH [^114zYH9K]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia is the most frequent electrolyte disorder, and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) accounts for approximately one-third of all cases. In the diagnosis of SIADH, it is important to ascertain the euvolemic state of extracellular fluid volume both clinically and by laboratory measurements. SIADH should be treated to alleviate symptoms. While this is undisputed in the presence of grave or advanced symptoms, the clinical role and indications for treatment in the presence of mild to moderate symptoms are currently unclear.

Therapeutic modalities include nonspecific measures such as fluid restriction, hypertonic saline, urea, and demeclocycline, with fluid restriction and hypertonic saline being commonly used. Recently, vasopressin receptor antagonists, called vaptans, have been introduced as specific and direct therapy for SIADH. Although clinical experience with vaptans is limited at this time, they appear advantageous for patients because there is no need for fluid restriction and the correction of hyponatremia can be achieved comfortably and within a short time. Vaptans also seem beneficial for physicians and staff due to their efficiency and reliability. The side effects include thirst, polydipsia, and frequency of urination.

In any therapy of chronic SIADH, it is important to limit the daily increase of serum sodium to less than 8–10 mmol/liter because higher correction rates have been associated with osmotic demyelination. In the case of vaptan treatment, the first 24 hours are critical for the prevention of overly rapid correction.

### Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone and hyponatremia after spinal surgery [^111tY5vT]. Neurosurgical Focus (2004). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia caused by an inappropriately high level of antidiuretic hormone secretion after spinal surgery is an uncommon and self-limiting phenomenon that resolves within 2 or 3 weeks. During the early postoperative period, the patient's urine output and serum sodium levels should be monitored closely to prevent possible serious complications of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. Symptoms vary depending on the severity of the hyponatremia and can range from mild headache, muscle cramps, nausea, and vomiting to convulsions, coma, and death.

- **Treatment options**: Include fluid restriction, oral intake of salt, and hypertonic saline.

It is important that spine surgeons recognize this phenomenon early and treat it appropriately and conservatively to prevent possible serious complications.

### A case report of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion with Castleman's disease and lymphoma [^1161nqd2]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is a condition characterized by excessive release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary gland or other sources, leading to water retention and hyponatremia. In this report, the association between SIADH and a rare combination of Castleman's disease and lymphoma is examined. The report explores the pathophysiological mechanisms likely contributing to the secretion of ADH in this context, including the role of interleukins (IL) and other cytokines. Understanding these mechanisms can help tailor therapeutic approaches for affected patients.

### Cost-effectiveness of tolvaptan for the treatment of hyponatraemia secondary to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in Sweden [^115RqkA8]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

Hyponatraemia (HN) is the most common electrolyte disturbance in clinical practice, occurring in approximately 15–30% of hospitalised patients. It is commonly defined as a serum sodium concentration ([Na+]) < 135 mmol/L, with severe HN defined as < 125 mmol/L. Hyponatraemia is associated with increased mortality, morbidity, and length of hospital stay.

Hyponatraemia can be euvolaemic (i.e. without an associated change in body fluid volume), hypervolaemic (i.e. body fluid volume is increased), or hypovolaemic (body fluid volume is decreased). These three types of HN have different sets of possible aetiologies. The most common cause of euvolaemic HN is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), which is the focus of our analysis. In SIADH, water retention is caused by inappropriate increased release of, or responsiveness to, antidiuretic hormone (ADH). This can be due to malignancy, pneumonia, central nervous system disorders, or certain drugs. Although SIADH can be associated with many different types of malignancy, it is most commonly observed with small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and studies have shown a higher mortality rate in SCLC patients with HN than in those without. Drug-induced SIADH usually resolves upon discontinuation of the medication.

Swedish guidelines for HN, published by the Swedish Endocrine Society and the Swedish Association for Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care, recommend resolution of the underlying condition as the primary treatment strategy in patients with SIADH. If symptoms are mild, HN secondary to SIADH may be…

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^11167oaL]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Electrolyte-free water administration (e.g. oral water or IV 5% dextrose) is critical in managing overcorrection. The European guidelines recommend a bolus of 10 mL/kg of electrolyte-free water over 1 hour (e.g. 500–1000 mL over 1 h for patients 50–100 kg). International expert panel guidelines suggest commencing an infusion of 3 mL/kg/h of IV 5% dextrose (i.e. 150–300 mL/h for patients weighing 50–100 kg) with hourly monitoring until the plasma sodium level (pNa) has returned below the 24-hour limit. We favor the larger upfront bolus in line with the European guidelines, followed by reassessment before any ongoing infusion. The Adrogué-Madias formula can estimate the sodium-lowering effect of 1000 mL of dextrose 5%, with the caveat that this formula assumes no net electrolyte-free water clearance or retention occurs as the dextrose is administered. If the pNa is rising faster than desired but has not yet exceeded the maximum target, an infusion of dextrose 5% can prevent further increments. As a rule of thumb, matching the rate of fluid input to hourly urine output (an imperfect indicator of electrolyte-free water clearance) should stabilize pNa in this instance.

Desmopressin, an AVP analogue, may be administered either IV or subcutaneously at a dose of 1 to 2 mcg to reduce urine output and prevent further increments in pNa. Desmopressin is particularly useful in polyuric patients when a reversible stimulus to AVP is no longer present and accumulated free water is rapidly excreted, heralded by hypotonic polyuria (i.e. low urine sodium and osmolality).

### Tolvaptan for the treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^116dV2Et]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

We recommend individualizing the treatment of SIAD, based on a benefit–risk analysis for each patient and several individual factors, including chronicity of hyponatremia, etiology of SIAD, comorbidities, symptoms, and biochemical parameters.

- **Rationale for tolvaptan use**: We promote the use of tolvaptan as the main pharmacotherapy for SIAD for several reasons. Tolvaptan is highly efficacious in correcting hyponatremia. Although evidence that tolvaptan improves hard clinical outcomes is currently lacking, this applies to all treatment options for SIAD. Therefore, using clinical judgment on a case-by-case basis, we decide whether each individual is likely to benefit from increasing serum sodium levels. Tolvaptan is the sole treatment modality licensed for the treatment of SIAD in the United States and Europe, having undergone a stringent review of the risk–benefit balance by regulatory authorities and based on high-quality evidence for efficacy and safety. In contrast, the use of other agents is supported by low-quality data, derived primarily from retrospective uncontrolled studies and case series.

- **Concerns about rapid correction**: Regarding concerns about tolvaptan-related overly rapid hyponatremia correction, greater effectiveness is associated with a higher risk for too rapid correction. However, this risk can be substantially reduced if patients undergo rigorous monitoring at frequent intervals and specific measures are implemented, when necessary, to prevent or even reverse overly rapid correction.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^1166gUQF]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

A prospective cohort study from the Netherlands, involving nearly 3,000 hospitalized patients with available sodium measurements over a 3-month period, found that 30% had a recorded sodium level below 136 mmol/L during their admission. A larger Danish prospective study of more than 250,000 inpatients reported that 15% had serum sodium less than 135 mmol/L at admission. Larger retrospective database studies from Singapore, the United States, and China support this range, with reported rates of sodium less than 135 mmol/L between 14.5% and 28.2%.

An outlying US study of nearly 200,000 patients reported only 5.5% had hyponatremia; however, this study employed stricter criteria, requiring two sodium concentrations below 135 mmol/L within 24 hours of admission, which would not capture those with transient initial hyponatremia, only a single result, or hyponatremia that developed later during the hospital stay. Rates of profound hyponatremia are lower, with approximately 2% of patients recording sodium concentrations at or below 125 mmol/L.

- **Specific patient subgroups at higher risk**: For example, following pituitary surgery, a meta-analysis showed 5.6% of cases develop symptomatic hyponatremia. Large database studies may fail to account for factors that can influence the accuracy of sodium measurements. Although many studies do seek to exclude translocational hyponatremia due to increased serum glucose, causes of pseudohyponatremia, such as increased serum lipids or proteins, are often overlooked.

### Zyvox [^115GEEFh]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

- **Hyponatremia and/or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)**: Postmarketing cases of hyponatremia and/or SIADH have been observed in patients treated with linezolid. In reported cases, the signs and symptoms included confusion, somnolence, generalized weakness, and in severe cases led to respiratory failure and even death. Monitor serum sodium levels regularly in the elderly, in patients taking diuretics, and in other patients at risk of hyponatremia and/or SIADH while taking Zyvox. If signs and symptoms occur, discontinue Zyvox and institute appropriate supportive measures.

- **Risks in patients with phenylketonuria**: Phenylalanine can be harmful to patients with phenylketonuria (PKU). Zyvox for oral suspension contains phenylalanine, a component of aspartame. Each 5 mL of the 100 mg/5 mL oral suspension contains 20 mg of phenylalanine. Before prescribing Zyvox for oral suspension to a patient with PKU, consider the combined daily amount of phenylalanine from all sources, including Zyvox for oral suspension. The other Zyvox formulations do not contain phenylalanine.

- **Development of drug-resistant bacteria**: Prescribing Zyvox in the absence of a proven or strongly suspected bacterial infection or a prophylactic indication is unlikely to provide benefit to the patient and increases the risk of the development of drug-resistant bacteria.

### Tolvaptan for the treatment of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD) [^116dVYFV]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia, the most frequent electrolyte abnormality encountered in hospital practice, is defined as a serum sodium concentration below 135 mmol/l and is associated with significant morbidity and excess mortality, with its commonest cause being the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD). Fluid restriction has been the mainstay treatment for SIAD in recent decades, despite the limited evidence base supporting its use. The modest efficacy of fluid restriction in increasing serum sodium, noted in large observational studies, was also confirmed in the first and only prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT), which reported a failure to respond in more than one-third of patients, highlighting the need for other therapies for SIAD.

Vaptans are non-peptide antagonists of arginine vasopressin (AVP) receptors that have been shown to be useful for the treatment of hyponatremia by selectively increasing solute-free water excretion from the kidneys. Several vaptans have been developed and tested in humans, including tolvaptan, conivaptan, mozavaptan, lixivaptan, and satavaptan. However, the only vaptan that is currently licensed and available in Europe is tolvaptan, but its role in the treatment of SIAD has been disputed, and its place in therapeutic strategies remains unclear. This review summarizes the state of knowledge on the use of tolvaptan for hyponatremia due to SIAD, exploring its effectiveness and safety. It also attempts to define its place in the treatment armamentarium of SIAD and to form a protocol for its optimal use in clinical practice.

### Copeptin and its role in the diagnosis of diabetes insipidus and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis [^116VRq9H]. Clinical Endocrinology (2019). Low credibility.

Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is the main regulating hormone of body fluid homeostasis. It is secreted from the posterior pituitary upon osmotic or nonosmotic stimuli, with the main osmotic stimulus being increased plasma osmolality and the main nonosmotic stimulus being hypovolemia. AVP promotes water reabsorption via V2 receptors in the kidney, thereby normalizing hypertonicity and vasomotor tone.

Disorders of body fluid homeostasis are common and can be divided into hyperosmolar and hypoosmolar circumstances. The classical hyperosmolar disorder, characterized by a deficiency of body fluid relative to body solute, is diabetes insipidus. In contrast, the most common hypoosmolar disorder, characterized by an excess of body fluid relative to body solute, is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD).

Diabetes insipidus belongs to the polyuria-polydipsia syndrome and is characterized by a high urinary output of more than 50 mL per kg body weight per 24 hours, accompanied by polydipsia of more than 3 L a day. After excluding osmotic diuresis, such as hyperglycemia, the differential diagnosis of polyuria-polydipsia syndrome includes impaired AVP synthesis (central diabetes insipidus) or action (nephrogenic diabetes insipidus) as well as primary polydipsia.

Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis is the predominant cause of hyponatremia and is characterized by reduced free water excretion and secondary natriuresis, mostly due to an imbalanced secretion of the antidiuretic hormone AVP.

Arginine vasopressin measurement could theoretically help in the guidance of diagnosis and treatment.

### Cost-effectiveness of tolvaptan for the treatment of hyponatraemia secondary to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in Sweden [^111R1wBc]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

This study presents the first cost-utility analysis of tolvaptan for the treatment of hyponatraemia (HN) secondary to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) in a European setting. Treatment with tolvaptan was associated with reduced costs and better health outcomes, measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), compared with usual care in the 'general SIADH', small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and pneumonia populations considered in this economic evaluation. Based on the assumptions within this evaluation, tolvaptan represents a cost-effective treatment option for patients with HN secondary to SIADH who have either failed to respond to fluid restriction or for whom the use of fluid restriction is not suitable.

### Is it cerebral or renal salt wasting [^112ndk8z]. Kidney International (2009). Low credibility.

Cerebral salt-wasting (CSW) or renal salt-wasting (RSW) has evolved from a misrepresentation of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) to acceptance as a distinct entity. Challenges still confront us as we attempt to differentiate RSW from SIADH, ascertain the prevalence of RSW, and address reports of RSW occurring without cerebral disease. RSW is redefined as 'extracellular volume depletion due to a renal sodium transport abnormality with or without high urinary sodium concentration, presence of hyponatremia or cerebral disease with normal adrenal and thyroid function'.
Our inability to differentiate RSW from SIADH lies in the clinical and laboratory similarities between the two syndromes and the difficulty of accurate assessment of extracellular volume. Radioisotopic determinations of extracellular volume in neurosurgical patients reveal that RSW is more common than SIADH. We review the persistence of hypouricemia and increased fractional excretion of urate in RSW as compared to correction of both in SIADH, the appropriateness of ADH secretion in RSW, and the importance of differentiating renal RSW from SIADH because of disparate treatment goals: fluid repletion in RSW and fluid restriction in SIADH.

Patients with RSW are being incorrectly treated by fluid restriction, with clinical consequences. We conclude that RSW is common and occurs without cerebral disease, and propose changing CSW to RSW.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^1112hMeE]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

A lower initial dose of tolvaptan, 7.5 mg, has become more widely prescribed in recent years, as there is some evidence of lower overcorrection risk. In two small trials, overcorrection rates (each greater than 12 mmol/L in 24 hours) were seen with the 7.5 mg dose, yet with the standard 15 mg dose, 13% to 40% of patients overcorrected. However, the risk is not completely eliminated, as even an ultra-low dose of 3.75 mg did not prevent overcorrection greater than 10 mmol/L per 24 hours in a study of patients with acute postneurosurgical hyponatremia. Overcorrection rates were above 30% for both the 3.75 mg and 7.5 mg doses in this acute cohort.

Notably, these studies were not designed to determine the degree to which tolvaptan use, rather than autocorrection following resolution of reversible stimuli to AVP secretion, contributed to the overly rapid rise in pNa, as there was no placebo control group. The ultra-low dose of 3.75 mg is often impractical and inaccurate because it requires quartering a triangular tablet with formulations in many markets. An alternative approach to achieve an even lower overall dose is to administer 7.5 mg every second day. However, there are no published data to support this, and this strategy does not reduce the risk of overcorrection with the initial dose. The potential for overcorrection on initiation means that, in our experience, tolvaptan is best prescribed as single doses, with ongoing therapy reviewed daily.

### Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone induced by intraarterial cisplatin chemotherapy [^115gMexn]. Gynecologic Oncology (2002). Low credibility.

Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone induced by intraarterial cisplatin therapy is a previously unreported complication.

- **Case**: A 63-year-old woman with stage Ib2 squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix was treated with intraarterial cisplatin infusion in a neoadjuvant setting. Four days following the second course of chemotherapy, she became drowsy with severe fatigue and decreased mental awareness. Blood tests showed sodium of 110 mEq/L. Urine and plasma osmolarities were 308 and 240 mOsm/kg, respectively, confirming the diagnosis of a syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone induced by intra-arterial cisplatin infusion.

- **Conclusion**: The potential for development of clinically significant hyponatremia early in the course of cisplatin therapy with any infusion routes emphasizes the need to closely monitor patients.

### Endocrine dysfunction after traumatic brain injury: An ignored clinical syndrome [^113sAYkf]. Neurocritical Care (2023). Low credibility.

Injury to the hypothalamus, posterior pituitary, or pituitary stalk may cause water and electrolyte abnormalities, leading to conditions such as diabetes insipidus (DI) and the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) after traumatic brain injury (TBI).

DI occurs because of the underproduction of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), resulting in fluid and electrolyte imbalances. Diagnosing DI necessitates the exclusion of the effects of osmotic agents and hyperglycemia. The diagnostic criteria for DI are detailed in Table 1. The incidence of severe DI with gross hypernatremia is approximately 2.9%, while the overall incidence of DI in the early period after injury is about 22–26%. Patients with TBI have impaired consciousness, nausea, vomiting, and pain, and they often receive osmotic diuretics for raised intracranial pressure, which leads to decreased total intake. Polyuria further exacerbates water loss, resulting in a negative water balance. Consequently, hypernatremia and dehydration contribute to increased morbidity. It has been suggested that patients with features of acute DI should be screened for anterior pituitary dysfunction. Although DI is often transient, in about 6.9% of TBI patients, DI may persist from 6 to 36 months after injury.

Hyponatremia (sodium level < 135 mmol/l) is the most common (20%) electrolyte abnormality seen after TBI. SIADH occurs in 12.7% of patients with TBI in the acute phase. While typically transient, it can cause hyponatremia, exacerbate cerebral edema, and even precipitate seizures.

### Cost-effectiveness of tolvaptan for the treatment of hyponatraemia secondary to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in Sweden [^1113wNuR]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

The present analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness of tolvaptan in three populations of patients with hyponatraemia (HN) secondary to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) for whom the alternative treatment option is natural aquaretics (NAT). In the base case for the 'general SIADH' population, tolvaptan was the dominant strategy compared with NAT, as it was associated with a reduction in cost and an incremental quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gain. Cost savings are predicted based on reductions in length of stay (LOS), while QALY gains are a consequence of associated improvements in health-related quality of life (HRQL). Compared with NAT, tolvaptan was also the dominant strategy in the small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and pneumonia populations, associated with incremental cost savings and an incremental QALY gain. The results were sensitive to assumptions relating to the duration of tolvaptan treatment, LOS associated with NAT, and the reduction in LOS associated with tolvaptan treatment.

The data used to calculate LOS and HRQL was obtained from the SALT I and SALT II clinical trials. The patients in the trials were treatment-naïve, whereas patients in the model had either failed to respond to fluid restriction or the use of fluid restriction was not suitable. Patients who fail to respond to fluid restriction may have more severe forms of SIADH and may be unable to excrete electrolyte-free water. Therefore, they may respond differently to tolvaptan compared with the patients in SALT I and SALT II. Although the assumed positioning of tolvaptan in the model may be considered a limitation of the analysis, the positioning was based on Swedish guidelines for HN. Furthermore, there are indications from small case series that tolvap

### Urea to treat hyponatremia due to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^114aNjKF]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2025). Low credibility.

Use of urea to treat hyponatremia related to the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) has not been universally adopted due to questions about effectiveness, safety, and tolerability. This systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies addresses these questions.

- **Study design**: This PRISMA-guided study examined published research across four electronic databases.

- **Study populations**: Patients with SIADH-related hyponatremia.

- **Selection criteria**: Clinical trials and observational studies reporting at least one outcome related to serum sodium concentration, symptom resolution, or adverse effects after oral or nasogastric urea administration.

- **Data extraction**: Data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers using a standardized form recording study characteristics, participant demographics, intervention details, and treatment outcomes.

- **Analytical approach**: A meta-analysis was conducted using the restricted maximum likelihood method for the random effects model to assess the effect of urea treatment on serum sodium and serum urea compared with other treatment modalities. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on treatment duration and SIADH severity.

- **Results**: Urea treatment significantly increased serum sodium (mean difference [MD], 9.08 [95% CI, 7.64–10.52], P < 0.01) and urea (MD, 31.66 [95% CI, 16.05–47.26], P < 0.01) in patients with SIADH, albeit with significantly high heterogeneity. Subgroup analysis based on the treatment duration showed a significant rise in the serum sodium level after 24 hours.

Hyponatremia secondary to the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) is not uncommon in patients receiving treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or venlafaxine.

This case report involves a 47-year-old man with depression who developed hyponatremia after commencing treatment with desvenlafaxine. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of desvenlafaxine-associated SIADH since the introduction of the drug.

Physicians should be aware of the possibility of desvenlafaxine-associated hyponatremia in patients under the age of 65.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^111yho3U]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

Renal V2 receptors are located on the basolateral membrane of principal cells in the collecting duct. Stimulation of the V2 receptor increases the synthesis and insertion of aquaporin-2 water channels that enhance water permeability. This leads to increased reabsorption of water from the glomerular filtrate, resulting in water retention and more concentrated urine (Fig. 5). Additionally, AVP promotes water resorption by increasing the medullary interstitial osmotic gradient. It achieves this by enhancing the expression of epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC) to increase sodium reabsorption and by increasing urea transporters (UT-A1s) to enhance urea reabsorption. These mechanisms elevate the osmotic gradient in the renal interstitium, drawing additional water from the filtrate and further contributing to urine concentration.

AVP can be viewed as an essential hormone to maintain tissue perfusion and defend against physiological and psychological stress. This critical importance of AVP for survival is demonstrated by the fact that hypothalamic AVP production is highly redundant, with clinical AVP deficiency (diabetes insipidus) manifesting only if more than 90% of hypothalamic AVP neurons are destroyed. Experiments in rodents show that the defenses against deviations of blood volume or osmolarity from their set points are very finely tuned. In hyperosmolar states, the presentation of water-predicting cues reduces AVP-secreting neuron activity within seconds, even before water ingestion begins. Likewise, optogenetic experiments suggest that thirst-sensing neurons can predict how water consumption will alter fluid balance.

### A case report of syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion with Castleman's disease and lymphoma [^111j3stj]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2013). Low credibility.

Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is a common cause of hyponatremia in hospitalized patients and is often associated with small-cell carcinoma of the lung. In this report, we describe both Castleman's disease and lymphoma coexisting in one patient with SIADH.

- **Case presentation**: A 70-year-old Chinese woman with a history of diabetes mellitus and insulin therapy presented with severe hyponatremia and gastrointestinal symptoms. Through a series of examinations, common causes such as pulmonary carcinoma were excluded. An abdominal mass was detected by computed tomography. Although the peripheral lymph node biopsy indicated Castleman's disease, the pathology of the abdominal lymph node revealed diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Following chemotherapy, the hyponatremia was addressed during a period of follow-up.

- **Conclusion**: This patient presented with the rare clinical condition of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion alongside Castleman's disease and lymphoma. Asymptomatic hyponatremia may persist for some time, suggesting that clinical physicians should pay attention to mild cases of hyponatremia. We also hypothesized that Castleman's disease may be a precursor to lymphoma, with both conditions having the potential to cause SIADH. The possibility of lymphoma as well as Castleman's disease triggering the development of SIADH should be considered when conducting repeat biopsies.

Fluid restriction

In patients with SIAD, fluid restriction (FR) is the first-line therapy currently recommended by EU and US hyponatremia guidelines, though evidence for efficacy is limited. FR has the advantages of being free and readily accessible; however, limitations include patient adherence, accuracy of fluid balance monitoring in real-world conditions, potential competing needs for concomitant medications that require coadministration of oral or IV fluid, and potentially poor tolerability with respect to thirst and quality of life.

Interestingly, the osmotic threshold for thirst is lower in those with chronic SIAD, which may contribute to discomfort with FR. In a study comparing water intake post hypertonic saline infusion in eight patients with chronic SIAD and eight healthy controls, onset of thirst occurred at a significantly lower serum osmolality in those with SIAD: 264 vs. 285 mOsm/kgH2O.

### A copeptin-based classification of the osmoregulatory defects in the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis [^1121QQXQ]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia, the most frequent electrolyte disorder, is predominantly caused by the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (SIAD). A comprehensive characterization of SIAD subtypes, defined by the type of osmotic dysregulation, is lacking but may aid in predicting therapeutic success.

We analyzed serial measurements of serum osmolality and serum sodium, plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP), and plasma copeptin concentrations from 50 patients with hyponatremia who underwent hypertonic saline infusion. A close correlation between copeptin concentrations and serum osmolality existed in 68 healthy controls, with a mean osmotic threshold ± SD of 282 ± 4 mOsM/kg H2O. Furthermore, saline-induced changes in copeptin concentrations correlated with changes in AVP concentrations in both controls and patients.

Using copeptin concentration as a surrogate measure of AVP concentration, patients with SIAD were grouped according to osmoregulatory defect:

- **Type A**: Ten percent of patients had grossly elevated copeptin concentrations independent of serum osmolality.
- **Type B**: Fourteen percent had copeptin concentrations that increased linearly with rising serum osmolality but had abnormally low osmotic thresholds.
- **Type C**: Forty-four percent had normal copeptin concentrations independent of osmolality.
- **Type D**: Twelve percent had suppressed copeptin concentrations independent of osmolality.
- **Type E or reset barostat**: A novel SIAD subtype discovered in 20% of patients, characterized by a linear decrease in copeptin concentrations with increasing serum osmolality.

In conclusion, there is a partial or complete loss of AVP osmoregulat…

### Vasopressin-dependent disorders: What is new in children [^11319S3y]. Pediatrics (2021). Low credibility.

Arginine vasopressin (AVP)-mediated osmoregulatory disorders, such as diabetes insipidus (DI) and syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), are common in the differential diagnosis for children with hypo- and hypernatremia and require timely recognition and treatment. DI is caused by a failure to concentrate urine secondary to impaired production of or response to AVP, resulting in hypernatremia. Newer methods of diagnosing DI include measuring copeptin levels; copeptin is AVP's chaperone protein and serves as a surrogate biomarker of AVP secretion. Intraoperative copeptin levels may also help predict the risk for developing DI after neurosurgical procedures. Copeptin levels hold diagnostic promise in other pediatric conditions too. Recently, expanded genotype and phenotype correlations in inherited DI disorders have been described and may better predict the clinical course in affected children and infants. Similarly, newer formulations of synthetic AVP may improve pediatric DI treatment.

In contrast to DI, SIADH, characterized by inappropriate AVP secretion, commonly leads to severe hyponatremia. Contemporary methods aid clinicians in distinguishing SIADH from other hyponatremic conditions, particularly cerebral salt wasting. Further research on the efficacy of therapies for pediatric SIADH is needed, although some adult treatments hold promise for pediatrics. Lastly, expansion of home point-of-care sodium testing may transform management of SIADH and DI in children.

In this article, we review recent developments in the understanding of pathophysiology and treatment of these disorders.

### Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone in traumatic brain injury: when tolvaptan becomes a life saving drug [^11291cxz]. Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry (2012). Low credibility.

To outline the role of a new drug, tolvaptan, in treating severe and chronic hyponatraemia, tolvaptan decreases aquaporin expression in renal collecting ducts by inhibiting antidiuretic hormone (ADH)-V2 receptors to promote free water clearance. Given its mechanism of action, this drug seems the ideal treatment for the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) when the osmotic imbalance leads to life-threatening complications.

A case is described of severe hyponatraemia deriving from SIADH secondary to meningoencephalitis in a patient admitted to hospital for traumatic brain injury.

Clinical, laboratory, and radiological data at presentation and for one year of follow-up were analyzed. Tolvaptan ameliorated hyponatraemia, brain oedema, and consciousness; however, drug withdrawal led to the recurrence of hyponatraemia and coma.

In patients with SIADH, which is not self-limited and is associated with severe cognitive impairment, the use of tolvaptan may prove life-saving and should be rigorously evaluated.

Regarding the medical management of arginine vasopressin deficiency, specifically concerning fluid therapy, the Society for Endocrinology's 2018 guidelines recommend deciding on the type and volume of fluid therapy for patients unable to manage their fluid intake and medication. These patients, who may have impaired consciousness or other conditions, should receive normal serum sodium equivalent to the daily requirements appropriate for patients without central diabetes insipidus. This should be administered alongside the agreed, prescribed dose of desmopressin.

### Diagnosing and treating the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion [^114oZizi]. The American Journal of Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is the most common cause of hyponatremia in clinical practice. However, the management of hyponatremia and outcomes in patients with SIADH are not well understood. The objective of the Hyponatremia Registry was to assess the management of hyponatremia due to SIADH in diverse hospital settings, specifically exploring which diagnostic and treatment modalities are currently used and how rapidly and reliably they result in an increase in serum sodium concentration ([Na(+)]). A secondary objective was to determine whether treatment choices and outcomes differ across the United States and the European Union.

- **Methods**: The Hyponatremia Registry recorded selected diagnostic measures and examined the use, efficacy, and outcomes of therapy for euvolemic hyponatremia diagnosed clinically as SIADH in 1524 adult patients with [Na(+)] ≤ 130 mEq/L (1034 from 146 US sites and 490 from 79 EU sites). A subgroup of patients with more rigorously defined SIADH through the measurement of relevant laboratory parameters was also analyzed.

- **Results**: The most common monotherapy treatments for hyponatremia in SIADH were fluid restriction (48%), isotonic (27%) or hypertonic (6%) saline, and tolvaptan (13%). Additionally, 11% received no active agent. The mean rate of [Na(+)] change (mEq/L/d) was greater for a

### Cost-effectiveness of tolvaptan for the treatment of hyponatraemia secondary to syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in Sweden [^112Diioz]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2016). Low credibility.

The model assumes a reduction in LOS of 20% based on the overall reduction observed in patients receiving tolvaptan compared with patients receiving placebo in the SIADH population of the SALT trials. This reduction was not statistically significant, and the studies were not powered to demonstrate a difference in the reduction of LOS. However, a subgroup analysis of euvolaemic patients with HN in the investigator-diagnosed SIADH group, combined with patients classified as 'other' (all patients not meeting clinical criteria for diagnosis of heart failure or cirrhosis), demonstrated a significantly shortened LOS favoring tolvaptan (4.70 ± 3.89 versus 8.40 ± 9.67 days; p = 0.045; a reduction of 44%). These preliminary findings should ideally be confirmed by clinical trials designed to evaluate this outcome.

A reduction of LOS, as demonstrated in the SALT trials, is supported by preliminary data from the HN registry showing that the median LOS from the start of treatment was shortest for tolvaptan (3 days) and longest for no treatment (6 days). Published data in HN relevant to the analysis are limited, not least due to the complexity of the condition and the clinical pathway. Every effort was made to identify the most relevant data for the model, using real-world data sources where possible. Sweden-specific data were used where available.

Basing model LOS data in the SCLC and pneumonia populations on evidence from the SALT trials may be considered a source of uncertainty, as the percentage of patients in the study population with SCLC or pneumonia is not known.

### Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone associated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor administration [^114mKHvY]. Pediatric Cardiology (2013). Low credibility.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) are an important medication in the treatment of congestive heart failure. However, ACEIs may cause harmful side effects, such as the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), which is a rare but significant side effect. We describe here a case of SIADH associated with ACEI administration in a 6-year-old boy with restrictive cardiomyopathy. After recovery from acute exacerbation of congestive heart failure by tolvaptan administration, an ACEI (cilazapril) was started to decrease the production of angiotensin II, which upregulates serum antidiuretic hormone secretion. The patient's heart failure symptoms worsened, including accumulation of right pleural effusion and ascites, after the initiation of ACEI administration. Cessation of ACEI administration dramatically improved his symptoms. Because it is difficult to distinguish SIADH associated with ACEI from worsening congestive heart failure, the possibility of fluid retention due to ACEI administration should always be considered when this agent is administered to patients with heart failure.

### Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone following high dose rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer: a case report [^112piZa4]. BMC Urology (2022). Low credibility.

The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone is a disorder characterized by the excess release of antidiuretic hormone and can result in hyponatremia. If managed inappropriately, severe hyponatremia can cause seizures, cerebral edema, and even death. There are various known causes of this inappropriate release of antidiuretic hormone, including malignancy, CNS disorders, and disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary-renal axis. However, reports of syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone after brachytherapy for prostate cancer are exceedingly rare.

- **Case presentation**: We report a case of symptomatic hyponatremia secondary to the inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone after prostate high-dose rate brachytherapy under general anesthesia in a patient with adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

- **Conclusions**: In rare instances, inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone can occur after high-dose rate brachytherapy for prostate cancer. The cause is likely multifactorial, involving pain or discomfort ensuing from the surgical procedure, the general anesthesia, or intraoperative drugs administered. However, due to the potential severity of the side effects, timely diagnosis is crucial to ensure prompt and effective management.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^114dm6hA]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

While there is some preclinical evidence that sex steroids may modulate the secretion of AVP, there is no consistent effect of sex on hyponatremia rates. Some studies report a slight male predominance, some a female predominance, and others no effect.

In population-based studies, SIAD is the most common attributed cause of hyponatremia, accounting for 35% to 40% of cases. However, most retrospective studies to determine the etiology of hyponatremia are limited by an incomplete diagnostic workup, with one multicenter registry finding that less than 50% of 3087 patients with hyponatremia had all appropriate investigations performed. A prospective study of 121 consecutive inpatients with pNa less than 130 mmol/L at a single hospital in Germany, assessed by a senior endocrinologist according to a rigorous diagnostic protocol, determined that 35% had SIAD, 32% hypovolemia, 20% hypervolemia (heart failure, cirrhosis, angioedema), 7% thiazide-induced hyponatremia, 4% primary polydipsia, and 2% adrenal insufficiency. Another prospective study at a tertiary neurosurgical referral center in Ireland of 1323 patients admitted with pNa less than or equal to 130 mmol/L initially classified 573 (43.4%) of these patients as having SIAD, though 22 of these (3.8%) were subsequently reclassified to adrenal insufficiency after completing further investigation.

### Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis: From pathophysiology to management [^115eEJTN]. Endocrine Reviews (2023). Low credibility.

An alternative approach that has been proposed is "proactive DDAVP", which involves the early empirical coadministration of both desmopressin (DDAVP) and hypertonic saline. The rationale is that overcorrection is frequently the result of a spontaneous water diuresis following the resolution of transient SIAD, interruption of polydipsia, or cessation of a causative medication. This spontaneous water clearance can be prevented with preemptive desmopressin. The advantage of this approach is that the rate of correction can be more precisely controlled with hypertonic saline alone (bolus or infusion), without variable outputs to contend with.

However, by potentiating SIAD through the administration of an AVP analogue before overcorrection occurs or appears imminent, this approach risks exacerbation or prolongation of hyponatremia symptoms, especially in the presence of ongoing fluid input. In patients with a chronic cause of SIAD (e.g. paraneoplastic SIAD), desmopressin is unlikely to have any effect as the underlying cause of antidiuresis is likely to continue.

The only data for this proactive approach stem from an uncontrolled observational study in 24 patients with plasma sodium levels less than 120 mmol/L, predominantly secondary to thiazide diuretics. These patients were treated with desmopressin 1 to 2 mcg every 8 hours and weight-based hypertonic saline titrated to achieve a plasma sodium increase of 6 mmol/L in 24 hours. Overall, participants had a mean increase in serum sodium of 5.8 mmol/L over 24 hours. Two patients experienced a decline in serum sodium by 1 to 2 mmol/L after 4 hours, and two patients had an above-target increase in serum sodium.

In case of overcorrection: Relowering of plasma sodium

Overcorrection of serum sodium can occur as a consequence of any sodium-raising intervention, or may occur spontaneously with the resolution of a reversible stimulus for AVP secretion or cessation of excessive water input, and subsequent aquaresis. There is no evidence that spontaneous overcorrection of chronic (> 48 h) hyponatremia is any safer than iatrogenic overcorrection. To maintain the rate of correction within the target range, "relowering" of serum sodium can be achieved with administration of hypotonic fluid, with or without iatrogenic AVP therapy (desmopressin, DDAVP) to suspend urine output, and of course ceasing any active sodium-increasing therapy (see Figs. 8 and 10). Because the symptoms of ODS are delayed by several days, relowering remains essential for patients who are asymptomatic — but may also improve symptoms and outcomes for those with early clinical ODS.

The Diagnostic Criteria for Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion (SIADH) is a clinical tool designed to aid in the diagnosis of SIADH, a condition characterized by excessive release of antidiuretic hormone from the posterior pituitary gland or other sources. The criteria are primarily used to identify patients with hyponatremia, a common electrolyte disorder, who may have SIADH as the underlying cause.

- **Essential criteria**: The essential criteria include effective serum osmolality less than 275 mOsm/kg, urine osmolality greater than 100 mOsm/kg, absence of clinical evidence of hypovolemia or hypervolemia, urine sodium concentration greater than 30 mmol/L with normal dietary salt and water intake, absence of adrenal, thyroid, pituitary, or renal insufficiency, and no recent use of diuretic agents.

- **Supplemental criteria**: The supplemental criteria, which provide additional diagnostic support, include serum uric acid less than 0.24 mmol/L, serum urea less than 3.6 mmol/L, failure to correct hyponatremia after 0.9% saline infusion, fractional sodium excretion greater than 0.5%, fractional urea excretion greater than 55%, fractional uric acid excretion greater than 12%, and correction of hyponatremia through fluid restriction.

The Diagnostic Criteria for SIADH is a comprehensive tool that incorporates a wide range of clinical and laboratory parameters.

### Suprasellar arachnoid cyst resulting in the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion [^113s5ykg]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2010). Low credibility.

The syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is occasionally seen after hypothalamic injury or dysfunction, although it typically occurs in association with other endocrine disturbances. It has never been described as a presenting feature of a suprasellar arachnoid cyst (SAC) in the pediatric population. The authors describe the case of an enlarging SAC resulting in SIADH as the only presenting feature, with an otherwise normal hypothalamic-pituitary axis.

An SAC was diagnosed in utero in this 5-month-old girl who had a normal functioning hypothalamic-pituitary axis on presentation. Due to cyst enlargement and hydrocephalus, the patient was scheduled for surgery; however, preoperative labs revealed SIADH. After stabilizing the serum sodium concentration with fluid restriction and the administration of 3% sodium chloride, the patient underwent endoscopic cyst fenestration. Postoperatively, she had complete resolution of the SIADH.

- **Proposed mechanism**: In the aforementioned patient, the proposed mechanism for SIADH was enlargement of the suprasellar arachnoid cyst causing compression of the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, thus overstimulating the secretion of arginine vasopressin, which resulted in SIADH.

The association of SIADH with an SAC is reportable, as is the resolution of the SIADH via cyst fenestration. The authors suggest that SIADH is an uncommon presenting feature of SACs and that syndrome resolution is possible with surgical intervention.

He was subsequently admitted for acute severe hyponatremia due to SIADH. His sodium was slowly corrected with hypertonic saline with a goal of 6–8 mEq/L per day, and he was also placed on fluid restriction of less than 2 L of free water daily. His symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, lightheadedness, and dizziness, improved by the next day as his serum sodium started to improve, and all symptoms resolved by the second hospitalization day. His hospitalization lasted for 2 days, and he was discharged with a serum sodium of 130 mEq/L. He was counseled to maintain a 2 L per day fluid restriction and to have close follow-up with his primary care physician for repeat labs. On follow-up labs 2 days after his hospital discharge, his sodium remained within normal limits, and his fluid restriction was lifted.

### Clinical laboratory evaluation of the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone [^113VBoKn]. Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2008). Low credibility.

Hyponatremia secondary to the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) is a frequent cause of hypotonicity. Although the differential diagnosis with other causes of hypotonicity, such as salt depletion, is sometimes challenging, some simple and readily available biologic parameters can be helpful in diagnosing SIADH. In SIADH, urea is typically low; this is less specific for elderly patients, for whom lower clearance of urea accounts for higher values.

Low levels of uric acid are more often seen in SIADH (70%) compared with salt-depleted patients (40%). Typically, patients with SIADH will show a lower anion gap with nearly normal total CO2 and serum potassium, despite dilution. In patients with hyponatremia secondary to hypocorticism, total CO2 is usually lower than in nonendocrine SIADH despite low urea and uric acid levels.

Urine biology can also be helpful in diagnosing SIADH because patients with SIADH have high urine sodium (Na; > 30 mEq/L), and most of them will have a high fractional excretion of Na (> 0.5% in 70% of cases), reflecting salt intake. Conversely, low urine Na in patients with SIADH and poor alimentation is not rare. Finally, measurement of urine osmolality is useful for the diagnosis of polydipsia and reset osmostat and could further help in the choice of therapeutic strategy. Patients with low urine osmolality will benefit from water restriction or urea, whereas those with high urine osmolality (> 600 mOsm/kg) would be good candidates for V2 antagonist.
