## Question

nitrous oxide in anesthesia risks/benefits

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the risks and benefits of nitrous oxide in anesthesia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic properties that underpin clinical effects. Then, I should verify the major clinical benefits across settings. Next, I will examine patient-level risks, followed by population-level and environmental risks. After that, I need to integrate guideline positions and trial data to reconcile conflicting evidence. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, risk-stratified recommendation and highlight knowledge gaps that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the pharmacologic foundation, because mechanistic plausibility often predicts clinical trade-offs. Nitrous oxide provides analgesia via opioid-like spinal mechanisms and NMDA receptor antagonism, with rapid onset and offset due to low blood-gas solubility, which supports quick recovery and titratability in procedural settings, though I should double-check that these mechanisms are consistently supported across sources before proceeding [^117Ugzgt] [^113gzBdT] [^113MMV3o].

> Now, I will examine the clinical benefits, starting with analgesia and anxiolysis. Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence in pediatrics and emergency care. Multiple ED and outpatient studies show meaningful analgesia and anxiolysis with 30–70% N2O for minor procedures, with rapid recovery and high satisfaction; combining N2O with local anesthesia improves pain control compared with local alone, and demand-valve systems are feasible in children, though efficacy varies with cooperation and procedure type [^117TFQEc] [^117275n2] [^113VDrbN]. I should also confirm the obstetric data; observational cohorts suggest roughly one-third of parturients obtain effective analgesia with N2O, and some studies associate its use with higher breastfeeding rates, though selection and confounding are likely, so I need to be cautious in interpreting causality here [^113soVgh] [^117J3pej].

> Next, I should review pharmacokinetic advantages that translate into clinical practice. N2O's low solubility yields rapid wash-in and wash-out, enabling faster induction and emergence when combined with volatiles, and it can reduce the required concentration of volatile agents by roughly half in adults, which may shorten recovery times. I need to ensure I'm not overstating this, so I'll anchor the MAC-sparing effect to the sevoflurane label and contemporary reviews [^115hw1UQ] [^116yVqS8] [^117BzKpV].

> Hold on, I should verify the potential benefit on chronic postsurgical pain, because NMDA antagonism is biologically plausible for preventive analgesia. The original ENIGMA follow-up suggested a reduction in chronic postsurgical pain with N2O, but the larger ENIGMA-II analysis found no overall effect, with a signal of benefit only in Asian patients and those with MTHFR variants; this heterogeneity means I should not generalize a preventive analgesic effect outside those subgroups without further data [^117NxVhA] [^1141bbUv].

> I will now examine patient-level risks, starting with postoperative nausea and vomiting, since this is the most consistent clinical signal. Multiple trials and meta-analyses show a duration-dependent increase in PONV with N2O, with risk rising about 20% per hour after 45 minutes; importantly, this risk is modifiable with guideline-directed prophylaxis, and the absolute benefit of avoiding N2O grows with longer cases, so I should tailor use and prophylaxis to baseline PONV risk and case duration [^115sXETd] [^114gEUGh] [^113P6F32].

> Let me consider pulmonary effects next, and I need to reconcile conflicting data. The Cochrane review reported increased atelectasis with N2O-based anesthesia, whereas a post hoc analysis of the ENIGMA-II Australian cohort found fewer atelectasis events with N2O; these discrepancies likely reflect differences in control groups, oxygen fractions, and definitions, so I should avoid overinterpreting either result and instead focus on lung-protective ventilation and oxygen titration strategies when N2O is used [^116rDDca] [^116MH1e6].

> I should confirm the cardiovascular risk signal, because mechanistic concerns about homocysteine and endothelial dysfunction exist. ENIGMA-II, the largest randomized trial in high-risk noncardiac patients, showed no increase in 30-day death or major cardiovascular events with N2O, and a one-year follow-up likewise found no excess in death, MI, or stroke; earlier observational signals of increased MI risk in ENIGMA-I were not reproduced in ENIGMA-II, suggesting that contemporary practice mitigates or that earlier findings reflected confounding, so routine cardiovascular harm from N2O is not supported by high-quality randomized data [^111cASUE] [^116hEfmj] [^111v4Dhb].

> But wait, what about neurotoxicity and special populations. Nitrous oxide inactivates methionine synthase and can precipitate subacute combined degeneration in B12-deficient individuals or with very high exposures; case series and mechanistic reviews support this, and pediatric patients with unrecognized B12 pathway issues may be vulnerable, so I should screen for B12 deficiency or methotrexate exposure when relevant and avoid N2O in those contexts [^113gzBdT] [^1166yrh9] [^114a72BJ].

> Next, I should review occupational and environmental risks, because these increasingly influence practice even when direct patient harm is modest. N2O is a potent greenhouse gas with a long atmospheric lifetime, and central piping systems leak substantially; professional societies recommend decommissioning central N2O manifolds, using portable cylinders with closed valves between uses, and prioritizing low-flow techniques or alternatives to reduce emissions, which can materially reduce the carbon footprint of anesthesia without compromising care when implemented thoughtfully [^1179eGBu] [^116LdtQx] [^117RawPC] [^113cXrbU].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about abandoning N2O entirely. I should integrate guideline positions and large trials to balance risks and benefits. Contemporary guidelines emphasize that N2O can be used safely across broad surgical populations, with attention to PONV prophylaxis, case duration, and patient risk factors; ENIGMA-II supports cardiovascular safety in noncardiac surgery, and stroke-focused guidance notes no increase in perioperative stroke with N2O, reinforcing that agent choice is unlikely to drive neurovascular outcomes when standard depth monitoring and hemodynamic management are applied [^111cASUE] [^116iW2at] [^111Bkkkm].

> I should double-check pediatric nuances, because practice is shifting. Concerns about impaired preoxygenation, laryngospasm risk, and occupational/environmental exposure have led some to recommend avoiding N2O for pediatric mask induction; nonetheless, procedural sedation data in children remain favorable when N2O is combined with local anesthesia and appropriate monitoring, so a blanket prohibition is not supported by the evidence base, though technique selection should reflect local expertise and risk profile [^117MQeAV] [^117TDt5y] [^113VDrbN].

> Let me synthesize a practical approach, and I need to ensure it aligns with evidence and guidelines. For short, low-risk procedures where rapid recovery and patient cooperation are priorities, N2O provides meaningful analgesia and anxiolysis with minimal cardiopulmonary depression; for longer cases or patients at high PONV risk, I should either avoid N2O or pair it with aggressive multimodal antiemetics, and I should avoid N2O in patients with known or suspected B12 deficiency, active methotrexate therapy, or gas-trapped spaces, while using lung-protective ventilation and oxygen titration to mitigate atelectasis concerns [^114gEUGh] [^116RGFAR] [^113MMV3o].

> Finally, I should acknowledge uncertainties and future directions. The preventive analgesia signal in Asian patients and MTHFR variant carriers warrants prospective validation, and the field would benefit from adequately powered trials of low-concentration N2O strategies, standardized oxygen control groups, and integration of environmental stewardship metrics into clinical trials. Until then, individualized risk–benefit discussions and mitigation strategies are prudent [^1141bbUv] [^1124LrYG] [^117RawPC].

Nitrous oxide offers **rapid onset/offset** [^113BcxCK] and **meaningful analgesia** [^117TFQEc] with minimal cardiovascular depression, enabling faster recovery and reduced opioid use [^113BcxCK]. However, it **increases PONV risk** [^111cASUE] (especially with > 1 hour exposure) [^115sXETd], can expand gas-filled spaces [^114QpRhK], and inactivates methionine synthase, posing risks for patients with B12 deficiency or on methotrexate [^114a72BJ]. It does not increase mortality or major cardiovascular events in high-risk patients [^111cASUE] [^116hEfmj] but is contraindicated in pneumothorax, bowel obstruction, middle ear surgery, and severe pulmonary hypertension. Environmental concerns are significant [^113cXrbU] due to its **high global warming potential** [^1179eGBu]; use low flows or avoid when possible [^116LdtQx]. Overall, nitrous oxide is **safe and effective when appropriately selected** [^1124LrYG], with PONV prophylaxis and vigilance for gas space expansion and B12/methotrexate interactions [^111cASUE].

---

## Pharmacological properties and clinical advantages

- **Rapid onset and offset**: Low blood-gas solubility enables fast induction and emergence, supporting rapid recovery and shorter PACU stays [^116rDDca] [^113BcxCK].

- **Analgesic properties**: Provides clinically meaningful analgesia, reducing intraoperative opioid requirements and potentially lowering opioid-related adverse effects [^117TFQEc] [^113BcxCK].

- **Minimal cardiovascular depression**: Unlike volatile agents, nitrous oxide has minimal direct myocardial depressant effects and does not significantly impair cardiac output or blood pressure [^113BcxCK] [^114QpRhK].

- **MAC-sparing effect**: Reduces the required dose of volatile anesthetics, potentially lowering their adverse effects and environmental impact [^116yVqS8] [^111cASUE].

---

## Clinical risks and adverse effects

- **Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV)**: Nitrous oxide increases PONV risk, particularly with exposures exceeding one hour; risk rises about 20% per hour after 45 minutes [^115sXETd] [^114gEUGh].

- **Expansion of gas-filled spaces**: Diffuses into closed spaces (pneumothorax, bowel obstruction, middle ear), causing complications; contraindicated in these settings [^113MMV3o] [^112oucZY].

- **Methionine synthase inactivation**: Inactivates methionine synthase, causing transient hyperhomocysteinemia; risky for patients with B12 deficiency or on methotrexate [^114B3JuT] [^114a72BJ] [^113MMV3o].

- **Respiratory effects**: Mild respiratory depression and diffusion hypoxia can occur, especially with high concentrations or prolonged use [^114QpRhK] [^112oucZY].

## Patient populations and clinical scenarios

| **Patient population/clinical scenario** | **Risks** | **Benefits** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| General surgical patients | - PONV <br/> - Diffusion hypoxia | - Analgesia <br/> - Rapid recovery | Use with PONV prophylaxis [^111cASUE] [^114gEUGh] |
| Patients with gas-filled spaces (pneumothorax, bowel obstruction, middle ear surgery) | - Significant expansion risk | - Minimal benefit | Contraindicated [^113MMV3o] |
| Patients with B12 deficiency or on methotrexate | - Methionine synthase inactivation | - Minimal benefit | Avoid use [^116rotyB] [^114a72BJ] |
| Pediatric patients | - PONV <br/> - Diffusion hypoxia | - Rapid onset/offset <br/> - Analgesia | Use cautiously with monitoring [^114QpRhK] [^11658ykv] |
| Obstetric patients (labor analgesia) | - Minimal risk | - Effective analgesia <br/> - Patient control | Safe and effective [^111iX2kf] [^117J3pej] |

## Environmental considerations

Nitrous oxide is a **potent greenhouse gas** with a long atmospheric lifetime; its use contributes to climate change [^113cXrbU]. Strategies to mitigate its environmental impact include **low-flow anesthesia**, **leak detection**, and **avoidance when possible** [^116LdtQx] [^117RawPC].

---

## Summary of evidence

- **ENIGMA-II trial**: No increase in mortality or major cardiovascular events with nitrous oxide in high-risk patients [^111cASUE] [^116hEfmj].

- **PONV**: Increased risk, especially with prolonged exposure; manageable with prophylaxis [^115sXETd] [^111cASUE].

- **Gas expansion**: Contraindicated in patients with gas-filled spaces [^113MMV3o] [^114QpRhK].

- **Environmental impact**: Significant; use low flows or avoid when possible [^113cXrbU] [^116LdtQx].

---

Nitrous oxide remains a **valuable adjunct** in anesthesia, offering rapid onset, meaningful analgesia, and minimal cardiovascular depression, but it **requires careful patient selection** and monitoring due to PONV, gas space expansion, and methionine synthase effects. Its environmental impact also warrants judicious use and mitigation strategies [^1124LrYG].

Volatile anesthetics for procedural pain — We recommend not using inhaled volatile anesthetics for procedural pain management in critically ill adults (strong recommendation, very low quality of evidence). No RCTs comparing isoflurane to a control intervention were found, and a small double-blinded RCT of nitrous oxide 50% and oxygen with isoflurane versus nitrous oxide 50% and oxygen alone around CTR showed mixed results (more effective for the first chest tube but not the second). The panel does not recommend this intervention due to timing concerns, very low-quality evidence, resource needs, and safety issues outside the operating room.

### Influence of nitrous oxide anesthesia, B-vitamins, and MTHFR gene polymorphisms on perioperative cardiac events: the vitamins in nitrous oxide (VINO) randomized trial [^112c7guA]. Anesthesiology (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Nitrous oxide causes an acute increase in plasma homocysteine that is more pronounced in patients with the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T or A1298C gene variant. In this randomized controlled trial, the authors sought to determine whether patients carrying the MTHFR C677T or A1298C variant had a higher risk for perioperative cardiac events after nitrous oxide anesthesia and whether this risk could be mitigated by B-vitamins.

Methods

The authors randomized adult patients with cardiac risk factors undergoing noncardiac surgery, to receive nitrous oxide plus intravenous B-vitamins before and after surgery, or to nitrous oxide and placebo. Serial cardiac biomarkers and 12-lead electrocardiograms were obtained. The primary study endpoint was the incidence of myocardial injury, as defined by cardiac troponin I increase within the first 72 h after surgery.

Results

A total of 500 patients completed the trial. Patients who were homozygous for either MTHFR C677T, or A1298C gene variant (n = 98; 19.6%) had no increased rate of postoperative cardiac troponin I increase compared with wild-type and heterozygous patients (11.2 vs. 14.0%; relative risk 0.96; 95% CI, 0.85–1.07; P = 0.48). B-vitamins blunted the rise in homocysteine, but had no effect on cardiac troponin I increase compared with patients receiving placebo (13.2 vs. 13.6%; relative risk 1.02; 95% CI 0.78 to 1.32; P = 0.91).

Conclusions

Neither MTHFR C677T and A1298C gene variant, nor acute homocysteine increase are associated with perioperative cardiac troponin increase after nitrous oxide anesthesia. B-vitamins blunt nitrous oxide-induced homocysteine increase but have no effect on cardiac troponin I increase.

Safe and predictable analgesia is required for the potentially painful or uncomfortable procedures often undertaken in an emergency department. The characteristics of an ideal analgesic agent are safety, predictability, non-invasive delivery, freedom from side effects, simplicity of use, and a rapid onset and offset.

### Promoting low-flow anaesthesia and volatile anaesthetic agent choice [^1158pk9C]. BMJ Open Quality (2019). High credibility.

Background

We wanted to reduce costs and to provide environmental benefits during our project by promoting the use of low-flow anaesthesia, but what exactly does this mean? Low-flow and minimal-flow anaesthesia are characterised by the rate of fresh gas flow (L/min), which is fed into the breathing gas system of the circuit (eg, the anaesthetic machine). The concept of low-flow anaesthesia is not new, having been first described in 1952 by Foldes et al. They described a technique for nitrous oxide–oxygen anaesthesia with a gas flow of 1 L/min. Following on from this, Virtue described a technique for minimal flow anaesthesia in 1974. In this technique, the flows are reduced to 0.5 L/min. Although there is no absolute and universally accepted definition of low-flow anaesthesia, it certainly implies a carrier gas flow less than that attainable with a non-absorber breathing system. Among the anaesthetic community worldwide, flow rates of ≤ 1 L/min would be compatible with an accepted definition of low-flow anaesthesia.

There are multiple benefits of employing low-flow anaesthesia. There are obvious environmental and economic benefits since lowering gas flow rates through the breathing circuit reduces the amount of volatile agent, which leaks out of the circuit via the adjustable pressure limiting valve and the scavenging system. Very little of the volatile agent is metabolised by the patient, so there is greater conservation of volatile agent per case and less released into the atmosphere as environmental pollution. As anaesthetists, we are more aware than ever of the environmental impact of our practice. The halogenated volatile anaesthetic agents are classed as greenhouse gases; thus, they contribute to global warming and are potentially damaging to the ozone layer. Anaesthetic gases currently represent 5% of the carbon footprint for all acute NHS organisations, and it has been estimated that the annual warming effect of all volatile agents is the equivalent of one coal fired power station. Anaesthetists, therefore, have a major role to play in contributing to a greener operating theatre.

### Impact of nitrous oxide use on parturient recall of neuraxial analgesia risks [^1161bLVp]. Journal of Clinical Anesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Study Objective

Nitrous oxide affects memory and recall. We aimed to determine if using nitrous oxide during labor affected patients' ability to learn and recall the risks and benefits of neuraxial analgesia.

Design

Single-center, prospective cohort study.

Setting

Labor and delivery unit in a large academic medical center.

Patients

Nulliparous patients with spontaneous or planned induction of labor.

Interventions

Parturients chose whether to use nitrous oxide during labor. At the discussion for epidural consent, 4 risks were described: headache, infection, nerve damage, bleeding.

Measurements

Labor pain score, time from nitrous oxide discontinuation, and cervical dilation were documented at the discussion of epidural risks. Patients were assessed for unprompted recall and prompted recall of epidural risks on postpartum day 1 and unprompted recall at postpartum week 6. The number and proportion of patients who indicated each true risk (unprompted and prompted recall) or distractor (prompted recall only) were summarized by treatment group and results compared using Pearson χ² tests.

Main Results

Of the 403 enrolled patients, 294 (73%) did not use nitrous oxide, and 109 (27%) did. The 2 groups were similar except women who used nitrous oxide were more likely to be cared for by midwives and had higher pain scores at their epidural request. Scores for unprompted or prompted recall of epidural risks were not different between women who received or did not receive nitrous oxide. All 4 risks were recalled unprompted by only 3% in the nitrous oxide group and by 6% in the group not receiving nitrous oxide (P = 0.18).

Conclusions

The use of nitrous oxide for labor analgesia does not adversely influence a parturient's ability to recall the risks of epidural placement. Patients who receive nitrous oxide for labor analgesia should be considered eligible to provide consent for subsequent procedures.

### Practice advisory for intraoperative awareness and brain function monitoring: a report by the American society of anesthesiologists task force on intraoperative awareness [^115wngiS]. Anesthesiology (2006). Medium credibility.

Appendix 1 — Preoperative evaluation for intraoperative awareness risk includes: review patient medical records for potential risk factors such as substance use or abuse, previous episode of intraoperative awareness, history of difficult intubation or anticipated difficult intubation, chronic pain patients using high doses of opioids, ASA physical status IV or V, and limited hemodynamic reserve; interview the patient to assess level of anxiety and obtain information regarding previous experiences with anesthesia; and determine other potential risk factors including cardiac surgery, cesarean delivery, trauma surgery, emergency surgery, reduced anesthetic doses in the presence of paralysis, planned use of muscle relaxants during the maintenance phase of general anesthesia, and planned use of nitrous oxide–opioid anesthesia. Patients whom the individual clinician considers to be at substantially increased risk of intraoperative awareness should be informed of the possibility of intraoperative awareness when circumstances permit.

### Views of people who have given birth on the environmental and occupational exposure risks of nitrous oxide for labour analgesia: an interview-based qualitative study [^116pS1p6]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Some of our study participants used nitrous oxide for labour analgesia despite not intending to do so or continued to use it despite finding it ineffective. The variable analgesic efficacy of nitrous oxide is well‐recognised, and the many non‐analgesic benefits of nitrous oxide were reported by our participants as being one of its advantages over other methods of labour analgesia. This supports existing research which has found that there are many complex contributors to maternal satisfaction with labour, including effective communication and being involved in decision‐making. This supports the need to ensure that people giving birth have the option to access the full range of pain relief choices during labour, of which nitrous oxide is the one used most widely in the UK.

It is true that other health systems are lower users of nitrous oxide for labour analgesia, for example, the USA and parts of Europe; furthermore, it was seen as a " bonus " by one of our participants who was from France. However, ensuring that people giving birth are safe and have as good an experience of childbirth as possible are key considerations when evaluating potential changes in practice or system design aimed at reducing the environmental impact of nitrous oxide. Delays in access to epidural analgesia were reported by some participants, and lack of pain relief was one of the key themes to emerge from the recent report by the All‐Party Parliamentary Group on Birth Trauma. Alternatives to nitrous oxide, such as remifentanil patient‐controlled analgesia, have variable availability in the UK and this option was not offered to any of our study participants. Socio‐economic deprivation is associated with lower utilisation of epidural analgesia, and reducing access to nitrous oxide may widen health inequalities. Participants reported a concern about the care of people giving birth not being prioritised more generally.

### Nitrous oxide may not increase the risk of cancer recurrence after colorectal surgery: a follow-up of a randomized controlled trial [^115uAhpb]. BMC Anesthesiology (2009). Low credibility.

Discussion

Despite significant improvements in diagnosis, surgical technique, and adjuvant therapies, cancer recurrence remains the primary cause of death in patients presenting with colonic malignancies. Cancer surgery, sometimes the best hope for cure, is nearly always associated with minimal residual disease, and competence of host defense, especially natural killer cell function, appears to be a critical determinant of whether residual disease develops into clinical recurrence.

Anesthetics impair immune function to various degrees; and at least in animals, anesthetic interventions that impair natural killer cells augment metastatic risk. For example, recurrence is more common with general than regional anesthesia in retrospective analyses of 129 women with breast cancer and 225 men with prostate cancer (unpublished data). Similar benefits of avoiding general anesthesia has been observed with melanoma surgery. Perioperative blood transfusion, which impairs natural killer cell function and promotes angiogenesis (which is necessary for metastases), may also increase recurrence risk after some types of cancer surgery – although this conclusion remains controversial.

Nitrous oxide impairs numerous immune functions, including those critical for fighting cancer. Our study has limited power resulting from its relatively small sample size. Increases in recurrence risk to as much as 83% or decreases by as much as 34% cannot be excluded. A larger, randomized, clinical trial would thus be helpful. We nonetheless note that previous major studies evaluating the effect of anesthetic interventions on cancer-recurrence risk in humans were retrospective; ours differs in being the first prospective randomized trial with blinded outcome assessment which markedly strengthens our conclusion.

In our study, postoperative analgesia was provided by patient-controlled intravenous opioids. In the first two postoperative hours, opioid use was similar in patients assigned to either nitrous oxide or nitrogen. Unfortunately, opioid use beyond the first two hours of recovery was not recorded. While it is thus possible that this confounds our analysis, it seems unlikely that intraoperative administration of nitrous oxide, an extremely short-acting drug, would alter opioid requirements beyond the initial recovery period.

### Nitrous oxide-based versus nitrous oxide-free general anaesthesia and accidental awareness during general anaesthesia in surgical patients [^111Zmqu9]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Accidental awareness during general anaesthesia (AAGA) is when a patient unintentionally becomes conscious during a procedure performed with general anaesthesia and subsequently has explicit recall of this event. Incidence estimates for AAGA vary, with the most common estimate being one to two cases per 1000 general anaesthetics. Evidence linking nitrous oxide use and an increased risk of AAGA has come from observational studies data but the literature is contradictory, with some studies finding a protective effect of nitrous oxide.

Objectives

To assess the effect of general anaesthesia including nitrous oxide on the risk of AAGA in patients aged five years and over.

Search Methods

We searched the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE and trial registers ((www.clinicaltrials.gov), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (www.who.int/ictrp/network/en/) and Current Controlled Trials (www.isrctn.com/)) for eligible studies on December 9 2015. In addition, we conducted forward and backward citation searching using key identified papers.

Selection Criteria

We considered all randomized controlled trials (RCTs), including quasi-randomized studies and cluster-randomized studies, of participants aged five years or older receiving general anaesthesia for any type of surgery. We included trials in which participants receiving general anaesthesia that included nitrous oxide for maintenance at a concentration of at least 30% were compared with participants receiving no nitrous oxide during general anaesthesia. The intervention group must have received nitrous oxide in conjunction with an additional anaesthetic. We excluded studies where the depth of anaesthesia differed between the study arms. For inclusion in the review, studies needed to state in their methods that they planned to assess AAGA. We defined this as when a patient becomes conscious during a procedure performed with general anaesthesia and subsequently has explicit recall of this event.

Data Collection and Analysis

We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane to identify studies. We extracted data and conducted 'Risk of bias' assessment using the Covidence database.

Main Results

We included 15 studies. The total number of participants included in the analyses was 3520. Most studies were small with fewer than 120 participants, although two larger studies with 2012 and 671 participants were included. There was considerable variation in many of the study characteristics, including the anaesthetics used. The concentrations of nitrous oxide varied between 50% and 70%, and half of the studies used clinical signs and haemodynamic changes to monitor depth of anaesthesia. As it was not possible to blind the anaesthetist to the anaesthetic used, we rated all studies at high risk of performance bias and we therefore downgraded the quality of evidence by one level for risk of bias using the GRADE approach. Other types of bias were generally low, or were rated unclear due to missing information. No studies were designed to measure AAGA as the primary outcome, and were therefore statistically underpowered to answer this review question. Despite the inclusion of 3520 participants, only three awareness events were reported by two studies. In one study the event was due to technical failure. Due to the rarity of the events, we did not consider it appropriate to pool the data, and we therefore downgraded the quality of evidence by a further level for imprecision using GRADE.

Authors' Conclusions

It is not possible to draw any conclusions from this review. The included studies were mainly small (fewer than 120 participants) and there were limited estimates of effect, with only two studies reporting any events. We cannot therefore determine whether the use of nitrous oxide in general anaesthesia increases, decreases or has no effect on the risk of accidental awareness.

### Nitrous oxide-based vs. nitrous oxide-free general anaesthesia and accidental awareness in surgical patients: an abridged cochrane systematic review [^112XATPA]. Anaesthesia (2018). Low credibility.

Accidental awareness during general anaesthesia can arise from a failure to deliver sufficient anaesthetic agent, or from a patient's resistance to an expected sufficient dose of such an agent. Awareness is 'explicit' if the patient is subsequently able to recall the event. We conducted a systematic review into the effect of nitrous oxide used as part of a general anaesthetic on the risk of accidental awareness in people over the age of five years undergoing general anaesthesia for surgery. We included 15 randomised controlled trials, 14 of which, representing a total of 3439 participants, were included in our primary analysis of the frequency of accidental awareness events. The awareness incidence rate was rare within these studies, and all were considered underpowered with respect to this outcome. The risk of bias across all studies was judged to be high, and 76% of studies failed adequately to conceal participant allocation. We considered the available evidence to be of very poor quality. There were a total of three accidental awareness events reported in two studies, one of which reported that the awareness was the result of a kink in a propofol intravenous line. There were insufficient data to conduct a meta- or sub-group analysis and there was insufficient evidence to draw outcome-related conclusions. We can, however, recommend that future studies focus on potentially high-risk groups such as obstetric or cardiac surgery patients, or those receiving neuromuscular blocking drugs or total intravenous anaesthesia.

### Consensus statement on pain management for pregnant patients with opioid-use disorder from the Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology, Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine, and American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine [^111iX2kf]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2025). High credibility.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) labor analgesia in pregnant people with opioid use disorder (OUD) is not absolutely contraindicated and should follow standard indications with added monitoring considerations. MOUD is not an absolute contraindication to receiving N2O labor analgesia (Class I, Level C-LD), and nitrous oxide use in laboring people with OUD should follow similar indications as patients without OUD with consideration for sedation and respiratory depression monitoring (eg, sedation scores, respiratory rate monitoring, continuous pulse oximetry) if not already utilized in institutional standard N2O protocols (Class I, Level C-EO). N2O exposure may lead to maternal sedation, hypoxemic episodes, and increased risk of respiratory depression among pregnant people receiving systemic opioids or sedatives/hypnotics, and some people with OUD may have a history of sexual trauma and posttraumatic stress disorder that may benefit from the anxiolytic effects of N2O.

### Nitrous oxide-related postoperative nausea and vomiting depends on duration of exposure [^115sXETd]. Anesthesiology (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Inclusion of nitrous oxide in the gas mixture has been implicated in postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in numerous studies. However, these studies have not examined whether duration of exposure was a significant covariate. This distinction might affect the future place of nitrous oxide in clinical practice.

Methods

PubMed listed journals reporting trials in which patients randomized to a nitrous oxide or nitrous oxide-free anesthetic for surgery were included, where the incidence of PONV within the first 24 postoperative hours and mean duration of anesthesia was reported. Meta-regression of the log risk ratio for PONV with nitrous oxide (lnRR PONVN2O) versus duration was performed.

Results

Twenty-nine studies in 27 articles met the inclusion criteria, randomizing 10,317 patients. There was a significant relationship between lnRR PONVN2O and duration (r = 0.51, P = 0.002). Risk ratio PONV increased 20% per hour of nitrous oxide after 45 min. The number needed to treat to prevent PONV by avoiding nitrous oxide was 128, 23, and 9 where duration was less than 1, 1 to 2, and over 2 h, respectively. The risk ratio for the overall effect of nitrous oxide on PONV was 1.21 (CIs, 1.04–1.40); P = 0.014.

Conclusions

This duration-related effect may be via disturbance of methionine and folate metabolism. No clinically significant effect of nitrous oxide on the risk of PONV exists under an hour of exposure. Nitrous oxide-related PONV should not be seen as an impediment to its use in minor or ambulatory surgery.

### European society of anaesthesiology task force on nitrous oxide: a narrative review of its role in clinical practice [^117BzKpV]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2019). Medium credibility.

Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) is one of the oldest drugs still in use in medicine. Despite its superior pharmacokinetic properties, controversy remains over its continued use in clinical practice, reflecting in part significant improvements in the pharmacology of other anaesthetic agents and developing awareness of its shortcomings. This narrative review describes current knowledge regarding the clinical use of N 2 O based on a systematic and critical analysis of the available scientific literature. The pharmacological properties of N 2 O are reviewed in detail along with current evidence for the indications and contraindications of this drug in specific settings, both in perioperative care and in procedural sedation. Novel potential applications for N 2 O for the prevention or treatment of chronic pain and depression are also discussed. In view of the available evidence, we recommend that the supply of N 2 O in hospitals be maintained while encouraging its economic delivery using modern low flow delivery systems. Future research into its potential novel applications in prevention or treatment of chronic conditions should be pursued to better identify its role place in the developing era of precision medicine.

### Use of nitrous oxide in dermatology: a systematic review [^113yHWDe]. Dermatologic Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Many dermatologic procedures are painful and can be distressing to patients.

Objective

To determine whether nitrous oxide has been used in dermatology and whether literature supports its use in terms of providing analgesia and anxiety associated with dermatologic procedures.

Methods

A search of PubMed and Cochrane databases was conducted through July 15, 2016, to identify studies involving nitrous oxide use in dermatology.

Results

Eight studies were identified and reviewed. The use of nitrous oxide/oxygen mixture resulted in a significant reduction in pain when used for photodynamic therapy, botulinum toxin therapy for hyperhidrosis of both the palms and axilla, aesthetic procedures involving various laser procedures, and in the treatment of bed sores and leg ulcers. However, pain scores were higher when nitrous oxide/oxygen was used in the debridement of chronic ulcers when compared with the use of topical anesthesia. In addition, nitrous oxide has been reported effective at reducing pain in hair transplants, dermabrasion, excision and repairs, and pediatric procedures.

Conclusion

Current literature provides some evidence that nitrous oxide, used alone or as adjunct anesthesia, is effective at providing analgesia for many dermatologic procedures. Nitrous oxide has many potential applications in dermatology; however, further evidence from randomized controlled trials is needed.

### The role of nitrous oxide in minor pediatric procedures in the emergency department: a systematic review [^117275n2]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Pediatric patients undergoing minor, but painful procedures in an Emergency Department (ED) need adequate relief of pain and distress to prevent long term negative effects and adversely impact procedures. Inhaled nitrous oxide (N 2 O) is a needle-free pain management option. We conducted a systematic review to determine whether N 2 O is as effective as local anesthesia in minor procedures. The purpose of this study was to evaluate available evidence regarding analgesic effectiveness of N 2 O in pediatric patients.

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane and Cinahl databases for controlled trials published in English with pediatric patients in an ED treated with N 2 O compared to local anesthesia and with pain as primary outcome. Adverse events was one of the secondary outcomes. The GRADE system was used to rate the overall quality of evidence.

Results

We included seven studies with a total of 371 patients. Two studies showed N 2 O was equally effective in pain treatment as local anesthesia. Five studies showed N 2 O combined with local anesthesia is more effective in reducing pain than local anesthesia alone. None of the included studies reported major adverse effects. The quality of evidence is low.

Conclusions

N 2 O can have an important contribution in pain management, but should be combined with local anesthesia for optimal pain management in pediatric patients undergoing minor, but painful procedures in an ED.

Level Of Evidence

IV.

### Postoperative pulmonary complications in the ENIgMA II trial: a post hoc analysis [^116MH1e6]. Anesthesiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Nitrous oxide promotes absorption atelectasis in poorly ventilated lung segments at high inspired concentrations. The Evaluation of Nitrous oxide In the Gas Mixture for Anesthesia (ENIGMA) trial found a higher incidence of postoperative pulmonary complications and wound sepsis with nitrous oxide anesthesia in major surgery compared to a fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.8 without nitrous oxide. The larger ENIGMA II trial randomized patients to nitrous oxide or air at a fraction of inspired oxygen of 0.3 but found no effect on wound infection or sepsis. However, postoperative pulmonary complications were not measured. In the current study, post hoc data were collected to determine whether atelectasis and pneumonia incidences were higher with nitrous oxide in patients who were recruited to the Australian cohort of ENIGMA II.

Methods

Digital health records of patients who participated in the trial at 10 Australian hospitals were examined blinded to trial treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was the incidence of atelectasis, defined as lung atelectasis or collapse reported on chest radiology. Pneumonia, as a secondary endpoint, required a diagnostic chest radiology report with fever, leukocytosis, or positive sputum culture. Comparison of the nitrous oxide and nitrous oxide-free groups was done according to intention to treat using chi-square tests.

Results

Data from 2,328 randomized patients were included in the final data set. The two treatment groups were similar in surgical type and duration, risk factors, and perioperative management recorded for ENIGMA II. There was a 19.3% lower incidence of atelectasis with nitrous oxide (171 of 1,169 [14.6%] vs. 210 of 1,159 [18.1%]; odds ratio, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62 to 0.97; P = 0.023). There was no difference in pneumonia incidence (60 of 1,169 [5.1%] vs. 52 of 1159 [4.5%]; odds ratio, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.77 to 1.72; P = 0.467) or combined pulmonary complications (odds ratio, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.69 to 1.03; P = 0.093).

Conclusions

In contrast to the earlier ENIGMA trial, nitrous oxide anesthesia in the ENIGMA II trial was associated with a lower incidence of lung atelectasis, but not pneumonia, after major surgery.

### Action guidance for addressing pollution from inhalational anaesthetics [^113cXrbU]. Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Anaesthesia is a carbon‐intensive specialty, involving the routine use of inhalation agents that are potent greenhouse gases. These gases are exhausted directly to the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. Relevant inhalational anaesthetics include volatile halogenated organic compounds (sevoflurane, desflurane, isoflurane, halothane) and nitrous oxide. While the environmental impacts of these agents should be mitigated, those of desflurane and nitrous oxide are several times greater in clinically relevant quantities, making them an even greater priority for intervention.

Volatile anaesthetic agents have been estimated to be responsible for 0.01–0.10% of total global carbon dioxide equivalent (CO 2 e) emissions contributing to global warming. Based on atmospheric sampling of volatile anaesthetics, their accumulation is increasing (particularly desflurane). Whilst these are a seemingly small contribution to total global emissions, inhalational anaesthetics account for 5% of acute hospital CO 2 e emissions and 50% of peri‐operative department emissions (in high‐income countries). Use of inhalational anaesthetics is directly within the control of anaesthesia providers and safe alternatives exist; thus, environmental stewardship is an important opportunity for greenhouse gas mitigation and professional sustainability leadership.

### Nitrous oxide occupational exposure in conscious sedation procedures in dental ambulatories: a pilot retrospective observational study in an Italian pediatric hospital [^113s1PiZ]. BMC Anesthesiology (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

The results of the present study contribute to the need to deepen and implement technical standards, criteria and systems, implant and structure requirements, as well as clinical-anesthesiological analyses useful to assess and define the advantages and disadvantages of the different analgesic/sedation systems. This study has the aim of protecting both the patients' safety and personnel exposure conditions that, as of today, are not yet completely defined or assimilated to others contemporaneously binding.

In conclusion, the authors would recommend the relevant role and use of nitrous oxide in a general dental ambulatory, and the good performance of the exhaust system used in the study. The authors intend to highlight the necessity of adopting a gas scavenging system, in an environment with adequate air changes/hour, and specific methodological indications in the anesthesia procedure to reduce the risk: correct mask size and adequate pressure of adhesion to the patient's face, reduction of the time of administration and dilution of gas concentration, etc. Therefore, in the presence of several recommendations without specific regulatory limits for diagnostic and/or therapeutic procedures that use nitrous oxide in non-operating room environments, the authors intended to give a contribution to the ongoing discussion on the definition of the reference values of environmental concentration of nitrous oxide and air change/hour necessary for the specific setting.

### Fourth consensus guidelines for the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting [^114gEUGh]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2020). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for postoperative nausea and vomiting, more specifically with respect to risk reduction, ASER/SAMBA 2020 guidelines recommend to implement the following strategies to reduce the baseline risk for PONV:

- use regional anesthesia to avoid general anesthesia

- use propofol for induction and maintenance of anesthesia

- avoid using nitrous oxide in surgeries lasting > 1 hour

- avoid using volatile anesthetics

- minimize intraoperative

- and postoperative opioids

- provide adequate hydration

- use sugammadex instead of neostigmine for the reversal of neuromuscular blockade.

### Clinical policy: procedural sedation and analgesia in the emergency department [^113BcxCK]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) — efficacy, pharmacologic effects, and pediatric procedural sedation evidence: Nitrous oxide is a relatively weak dissociative anesthetic gas that provides mild to moderate procedural anxiolysis, analgesia, and amnesia in a linear dose-response pattern, and onset and offset effects occur within 5 minutes and N2O does not require vascular access or painful administration. In healthy patients, N2O has minimal cardiovascular or respiratory effects; however, it may enhance the depressed response to hypoxia and hypercarbia induced by other agents, and use of local anesthesia and imagery to prepare patients, eg, imagining flying, significantly enhances the drug's efficacy. For clinical use, 30% to 70% N2O has been widely used to reduce distress in children during dental procedures, and a 50% concentration has also been used for management of acute pain in adults in out-of-hospital and ED settings; the demand valve-equipped fixed 50% N2O delivery apparatus commonly available in EDs is difficult for children to activate, but patients of all ages easily use the continuous-circuit devices, some of which deliver up to 70% N2O. In the evidence base, Sixty-one articles concerning use of nitrous oxide for procedural sedation in children were identified and, after grading, 44 articles were included with local anesthesia routinely used as an adjunct; in suturing studies, vomiting occurred more frequently with N2O (10% with N2O, 2% with N2O+midazolam), and one study using 30% N2O found less distress in children older than 8 years but only a trend in that direction in younger children.

### Clinical policy: procedural sedation and analgesia in the emergency department [^116rotyB]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) chronic exposure and patient susceptibility — chronic environmental exposure may adversely affect health care providers, while infrequent direct patient contact is likely safe except in rare patients deficient in enzymes associated with methionine synthesis or deficient in vitamin B12, in whom N2O may cause central nervous system injury; a Class III survey reported a 60% reduction in fertility among female dental assistants with greater than 5 hours per week of exposure to unscavenged N2O.

### Clinical policy: procedural sedation and analgesia in the emergency department [^114PpXz7]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) aspiration risk — no study was large enough to determine the risk of clinically significant pulmonary aspiration during inhalation; dye studies showed no radiopaque dye on chest radiograph after posterior pharynx dye placement in 50 children with 20% to 65% N2O or in 14 adult volunteers with 50% N2O for 5 minutes; traces of dye were found in 2 of 10 volunteers after 50% N2O for more than 10 minutes, and the clinical significance of this micro-aspiration is unclear; whether combining N2O with other sedative or analgesic medications increases aspiration risk is unknown.

### Nitrous oxide and perioperative cardiac morbidity (ENIgMA-II) trial: rationale and design [^114B3JuT]. American Heart Journal (2009). Low credibility.

Background

Globally there are > 200 million major surgical procedures undertaken annually, and about 20% of these involve patients who have coronary artery disease. Many receive nitrous oxide, which impairs methionine synthase, thus inhibiting folate synthesis and increasing postoperative homocysteine levels. Nitrous oxide anesthesia leads to postoperative endothelial dysfunction, and there is some evidence that it increases myocardial ischemia and, possibly, myocardial infarction. We have initiated the Nitrous oxide and perioperative cardiac morbidity (ENIGMA-II) Trial to test the hypothesis that in inpatients undergoing anesthesia for major noncardiac surgery, avoidance of nitrous oxide will reduce the incidence of death and major cardiovascular events.

Methods

ENIGMA-II is a 7,000-patient, international randomized trial involving patients at risk of coronary artery disease undergoing noncardiac surgery. The patients, health care providers (except for the anesthesiologists), data collectors, and outcome adjudicators are blinded to whether patients receive nitrous oxide-containing or nitrous oxide-free anesthetic. The primary outcome is a composite of death and major nonfatal events (ie, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, pulmonary embolism, and stroke) at 30 days after surgery.

Results

At present, ENIGMA-II has randomized > 1,000 patients in 22 hospitals in 5 countries. To date, patients' mean age is 70 years, 66% are men, 38% have a history of coronary artery disease, 19% have a history of cerebrovascular disease, and 84% have a history of hypertension. Most patients have undergone intra-abdominal 28%, vascular 32%, and orthopedic 16% surgery.

Conclusions

The ENIGMA-II Trial will be the largest study yet conducted to ascertain the benefits and risks of removing nitrous oxide from the gas mixture in anesthesia. The results of this large international trial will guide the clinical care of the hundreds of millions of adults undergoing noncardiac surgery annually.

### Perioperative care of patients at high risk for stroke during or after non-cardiac, non-neurological surgery: 2020 guidelines from the society for neuroscience in anesthesiology and critical care [^116iW2at]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2020). High credibility.

Anesthetic technique — recommendations state: When appropriate given a particular surgery, regional anesthetic techniques may be considered for reducing stroke risk, though the effect is likely to be small (Level B-NR, Class IIb). Either propofol or inhalational anesthesia can be used for maintenance techniques, given that there does not appear to be a difference in relation to stroke risk (Level A, Class III: No Benefit). Nitrous oxide appears safe across broad surgical populations (Level A, Class I).

### Nitrous oxide-based techniques versus nitrous oxide-free techniques for general anaesthesia [^116rDDca]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

Nitrous oxide has been used for over 160 years for the induction and maintenance of general anaesthesia. It has been used as a sole agent but is most often employed as part of a technique using other anaesthetic gases, intravenous agents, or both. Its low tissue solubility (and therefore rapid kinetics), low cost, and low rate of cardiorespiratory complications have made nitrous oxide by far the most commonly used general anaesthetic. The accumulating evidence regarding adverse effects of nitrous oxide administration has led many anaesthetists to question its continued routine use in a variety of operating room settings. Adverse events may result from both the biological actions of nitrous oxide and the fact that to deliver an effective dose, nitrous oxide, which is a relatively weak anaesthetic agent, needs to be given in high concentrations that restrict oxygen delivery (for example, a common mixture is 30% oxygen with 70% nitrous oxide). As well as the risk of low blood oxygen levels, concerns have also been raised regarding the risk of compromising the immune system, impaired cognition, postoperative cardiovascular complications, bowel obstruction from distention, and possible respiratory compromise.

Objectives

To determine if nitrous oxide-based anaesthesia results in similar outcomes to nitrous oxide-free anaesthesia in adults undergoing surgery.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2014 Issue 10); MEDLINE (1966 to 17 October 2014); EMBASE (1974 to 17 October 2014); and ISI Web of Science (1974 to 17 October 2014). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles, conference proceedings, and ongoing trials up to 17 October 2014 on specific websites (http://clinicaltrials.gov/, http://controlled-trials.com/, and http://www.centerwatch.com).

Selection Criteria

We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing general anaesthesia where nitrous oxide was part of the anaesthetic technique used for the induction or maintenance of general anaesthesia (or both) with any general anaesthesia using a volatile anaesthetic or propofol-based maintenance of anaesthesia but no nitrous oxide for adults undergoing surgery. Our primary outcome was inhospital case fatality rate. Secondary outcomes were complications and length of stay.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted the outcome data. We used meta-analysis for data synthesis. Heterogeneity was examined with the Chi² test and by calculating the I² statistic. We used a fixed-effect model if the measure of inconsistency was low for all comparisons (I² statistic < 50%); otherwise we used a random-effects model for measures with high inconsistency. We undertook subgroup analyses to explore inconsistency and sensitivity analyses to evaluate whether the results were robust. We assessed the quality of evidence of the main outcomes using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system.

Main Results

We included 35 trials (13,872 adult participants). Seven included studies were at low risk of bias. We identified eight studies as awaiting classification since we could not obtain the full texts, and had insufficient information to include or exclude them. We included data from 24 trials for quantitative synthesis. The results of meta-analyses showed that nitrous oxide-based techniques increased the incidence of pulmonary atelectasis (odds ratio (OR) 1.57, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.18 to 2.10, P = 0.002), but had no effects on the inhospital case fatality rate, the incidence of pneumonia, myocardial infarction, stroke, severe nausea and vomiting, venous thromboembolism, wound infection, or the length of hospital stay. The sensitivity analyses suggested that the results of the meta-analyses were all robust except for the outcomes of pneumonia, and severe nausea and vomiting. Two trials reported length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay but the data were skewed so were not pooled. Both trials reported that nitrous oxide-based techniques had no effects on the length of ICU stay. We rated the quality of evidence for two outcomes (pulmonary atelectasis, myocardial infarction) as high, four outcomes (inhospital case fatality rate, stroke, venous thromboembolism, length of hospital stay) as moderate, and three (pneumonia, severe nausea and vomiting, wound infection rate) as low.

Authors' Conclusions

Given the evidence from this Cochrane review, the avoidance of nitrous oxide may be reasonable in participants with pre-existing poor pulmonary function or at high risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting. Since there are eight studies awaiting classification, selection bias may exist in our systematic review.

### Increasing recreational nitrous oxide use: should we worry? A narrative review [^114zdPif]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Since 2000, the prevalence of recreational nitrous oxide (N 2 O) use has increased in the Western world. Although N 2 O is a relatively safe drug, the overall increase in the use of N 2 O has concomitantly also initiated a modest but important increase in the number of young excessive users. The recent introduction of large 2kg N 2 O tanks, allowing high and prolonged dosing, has facilitated this excessive use. This is of concern, because repeated exposure to high doses of N 2 O for a prolonged time is known to induce neurological damage, such as (irreversible) neuropathy and paralysis due to N 2 O-induced vitamin B 12 deficiency. The increasing trend of recreational users with N 2 O-induced neurological damage at emergency departments confirms the urgency of this development.

Objective/Methods

This narrative review describes recent trends in N 2 O use and misuse, the adverse health effects associated with excessive use and the risk factors of excessive use.

Results

Considering the rising trend in N 2 O use, particularly among young and other vulnerable people, we propose to take legislative action to limit the availability of N 2 O, and also advocate for better and timely education of non-users, users and medical professionals about the serious side-effects associated with excessive N 2 O use.

Conclusion

It is concluded that the increase in excessive N 2 O use is of serious concern.

### Management of trauma pain in the emergency setting: low-dose methoxyflurane or nitrous oxide? A systematic review and indirect treatment comparison [^116FQUPN]. Journal of Pain Research (2018). Low credibility.

Materials and methods

This systematic review was carried out and reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.

Literature search

Searches were undertaken from database inception to December 22, 2015 using the Embase, Medline and Medline In-Process databases, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. In addition, conference material of the 3 years prior to the search date from the European Society for Emergency Medicine and the International Conference on Emergency Medicine was screened, and the clinical trial register of the US National Institutes of Health, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry were searched for relevant unpublished trial data. Primary search facets were study design (facets according to Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network), emergency and trauma-associated pain, and intervention, using both medical subject heading and free text terms (for detailed search strategies, see Tables S1 and S2).

Study selection

Studies were required to fulfill the following criteria to be included in the review: 1) a population of adult patients (≥ 18 years), 2) trauma-induced pain in the prehospital or hospital setting, 3) randomized controlled trial or observational study design, 4) intervention low-dose methoxyflurane and/or N 2 O, and 5) English language publication. The screening process was performed independently by two reviewers; any disagreement was resolved by a third reviewer. Abstracts of all records identified in the search were checked for eligibility, and full-text copies of potentially relevant studies were rescreened.

Assessment of methodological quality

Risk-of-bias assessments were performed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool (shown in Table S3). Study grade for adequacy of concealment of random allocation and Jadad score for study quality and reportingwere also determined. To rule out the impact of clinical heterogeneity, studies were fully assessed for baseline comparability before they were included in the analysis.

Data extraction

Data extraction was carried out independently by two reviewers; a third reviewer resolved any disagreements. Information regarding study characteristics, type of pain scale employed, definition of pain relief, and patient data, including demographics, type and location of trauma, pain intensity at different time points, lack of pain relief, and occurrence of adverse events (AEs), was collected. Some of the pain-intensity and pain-relief data were extracted from illustrations in the relevant publications using graph digitization. Median pain scores from one study were obtained by post hoc calculations.

### Gases for establishing pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic abdominal surgery [^113f69PA]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Laparoscopic surgery is now widely performed to treat various abdominal diseases. Currently, carbon dioxide is the most frequently used gas for insufflation of the abdominal cavity (pneumoperitoneum). Many other gases have been introduced as alternatives to carbon dioxide for establishing pneumoperitoneum.

Objectives

To assess the safety, benefits, and harms of different gases for establishing pneumoperitoneum in patients undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgery.

Search Methods

We searched The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index Expanded, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM) until September 2012.

Selection Criteria

We only included randomized controlled trials comparing different gases for establishing pneumoperitoneum in patients undergoing laparoscopic abdominal surgery under general anaesthesia.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors identified the trials for inclusion, collected the data, and assessed the risk of bias independently. We performed the meta-analyses using Review Manager 5. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) or standardized mean difference (SMD) for continuous outcomes with 95% confidence intervals (CI).

Main Results

Carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum versus nitrous oxide pneumoperitoneum Three trials randomized 196 participants (the majority with low anaesthetic risk) to carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum (n = 96) or nitrous oxide pneumoperitoneum (n = 100). All of the trials were of high risk of bias. Two trials (n = 143) showed lower pain scores in nitrous oxide pneumoperitoneum at various time points on the first post-operative day. One trial (n = 53) showed no difference in the pain scores between the groups. There were no significant differences in cardiopulmonary complications, surgical morbidity, or cardiopulmonary changes between the groups. There were no serious adverse events related to either carbon dioxide or nitrous oxide pneumoperitoneum. Carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum versus helium pneumoperitoneum Four trials randomized 144 participants (the majority with low anaesthetic risk) to carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum (n = 75) or helium pneumoperitoneum (n = 69). All of the trials were of high risk of bias. Fewer cardiopulmonary changes were observed with helium pneumoperitoneum than carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum. There were no significant differences in cardiopulmonary complications, surgical morbidity, or pain scores. There were three serious adverse events (subcutaneous emphysema) related to helium pneumoperitoneum. Carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum versus any other gas pneumoperitoneum There were no randomized controlled trials comparing carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum to any other gas pneumoperitoneum.

Authors' Conclusions

1. Nitrous oxide pneumoperitoneum during laparoscopic abdominal surgery appears to decrease post-operative pain in patients with low anaesthetic risk.2. Helium pneumoperitoneum decreases the cardiopulmonary changes associated with laparoscopic abdominal surgery. However, this did not translate into any clinical benefit over carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum in patients with low anaesthetic risk.3. The safety of nitrous oxide and helium pneumoperitoneum has yet to be established. More randomized controlled trials on this topic are needed. Future trials should include more patients with high anaesthetic risk. Furthermore, such trials need to use adequate methods to reduce the risk of bias.

### Sevoflurane [^116yVqS8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Nitrous Oxide

As with other halogenated volatile anesthetics, the anesthetic requirement for sevoflurane is decreased when administered in combination with nitrous oxide. Using 50% N2O, the MAC equivalent dose requirement is reduced approximately 50% in adults, and approximately 25% in pediatric patients (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION).

Neuromuscular Blocking Agents

As is the case with other volatile anesthetics, sevoflurane increases both the intensity and duration of neuromuscular blockade induced by nondepolarizing muscle relaxants. When used to supplement alfentanil-N2O anesthesia, sevoflurane and isoflurane equally potentiate neuromuscular block induced with pancuronium, vecuronium or atracurium. Therefore, during sevoflurane anesthesia, the dosage adjustments for these muscle relaxants are similar to those required with isoflurane.

Potentiation of neuromuscular blocking agents requires equilibration of muscle with delivered partial pressure of sevoflurane. Reduced doses of neuromuscular blocking agents during induction of anesthesia may result in delayed onset of conditions suitable for endotracheal intubation or inadequate muscle relaxation.

Among available nondepolarizing agents, only vecuronium, pancuronium and atracurium interactions have been studied during sevoflurane anesthesia. In the absence of specific guidelines:

1. For endotracheal intubation, do not reduce the dose of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants.

2. During maintenance of anesthesia, the required dose of nondepolarizing muscle relaxants is likely to be reduced compared to that during N2O/opioid anesthesia. Administration of supplemental doses of muscle relaxants should be guided by the response to nerve stimulation.

The effect of sevoflurane on the duration of depolarizing neuromuscular blockade induced by succinylcholine has not been studied.

### The safety of nitrous oxide: glass half-full or half-empty? [^1124LrYG]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

A systematic review of clinical trials confirms that including nitrous oxide in the gas mixture for general anaesthesia has minor short-term benefits and does not impact most patient safety outcomes. However, no risk-benefit analysis of nitrous oxide should ignore its known environmental effects. If continued nitrous oxide use is supported, strategies to minimise and monitor the contribution of medical nitrous oxide to global warming are vital.

Urogynecology (2022). High credibility.

Standardized anesthetic protocol — anesthetic regimens should be designed to facilitate rapid recovery, routine preoperative sedatives should be avoided, and multiple anesthetic techniques are acceptable without evidence of superiority; if general anesthesia is chosen, sevoflurane or desflurane are preferred over isoflurane, and propofol-based total IV anesthesia facilitates rapid recovery and decreases postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), while nitrous oxide may increase PONV but this risk is eliminated with aggressive prophylaxis; lung-protective ventilation targets approximately 6 cc/kg ideal body weight and plateau pressure < 30 cmH₂O, though higher tidal volumes may be acceptable when low-tidal strategies cannot maintain oxygenation/ventilation; residual neuromuscular blockade is linked to complications and should be fully reversed if nondepolarizing block is used; spinal anesthetics should be tailored for rapid motor recovery; intraoperative analgesia should be multimodal with minimized opioids, and regional techniques, including transverse abdominis plane blocks and local infiltration, should be employed when appropriate.

### Factors to weigh in while administering nitrous oxide anesthesia [response to letter] [^1171e8j3]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Dear editor

Thank you for giving us the opportunity to respond to the publication in Clinical Ophthalmology entitled "Factors to weigh in while administering nitrous oxide anesthesia" by Shuja et al. We read with interest the letter to the Editor regarding the publication. This is our response to the three points raised by Shuja et al.

The first point is the use of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) anesthesia in patients with heart failure, hepatic dysfunction, and renal dysfunction. We perform preoperative electrocardiogram, chest x-ray, and blood test, and consult an internist to manage any abnormalities. Echocardiography is also performed when necessary. Additionally, we carefully monitor the vital signs of all patients, not only before, but also during and after surgery. Mitchell et al reported that N 2 O did not induce myocardial ischemia in patients with ischemic heart disease and poor ventricular function. The ENIGMA-II trial, a randomised, single-blind trial, showed no evidence that N 2 O increases the risk of cardiovascular complications after major non-cardiac surgery. We believe that 30% low-concentration N 2 O anesthesia can be safely used in patients with heart failure. Similarly, we also evaluate hepatic and renal function in blood tests preoperatively. Rahimzadeh described that N 2 O has been used in patients with advanced hepatic disease for many years without any complications. This suggests that N 2 O can be used safely in patients with hepatic disease. Although short operating time and low-concentration N 2 O anesthesia are thought to have little effect on the liver and kidney, chronic exposure to N 2 O anesthesia could cause hepatic and renal disease. When N 2 O anesthesia is used in ophthalmic surgery in the future, we should evaluate heart, liver, and kidney functions before and after surgery.

### Nitrous oxide may not increase the risk of cancer recurrence after colorectal surgery: a follow-up of a randomized controlled trial [^114qCwfd]. BMC Anesthesiology (2009). Low credibility.

Methods

In a previously published study, we evaluated the effect of nitrous oxide on the incidence of postoperative wound infection after colectomy. Our major conclusion was that nitrous oxide does not increase the incidence of postoperative wound infection after colon resection. The current study evaluated cancer recurrence in those patients whose original indication for surgery was colorectal malignancy. Patients were enrolled between November 11, 1998, and November 3, 2002, and our follow up extended until March 23, 2007; cancer recurrence was thus evaluated over a 4- to 8-year period. The study was not registered because patient enrollment preceded development of major public trial registries.

Both the original and the current study were conducted with the approval of the Institutional Review Boards of the participating hospitals. Written informed consent was obtained for the original study, i.e. nitrous oxide/postoperative wound infection, and then was waived for the current study. Briefly, patients enrolled in the original study were aged 18 to 80 years old. All had colon resections, usually for cancer or inflammatory bowel disease. All patients were given 35% inspired oxygen during surgery, which was balanced by either 65% nitrous oxide or nitrogen that was randomly assigned. The remainder of the isoflurane and remifentanil anesthetic was standardized, as was antibiotic prophylaxis. All patients were kept normothermic because hypothermia triples infection risk.

Among the 418 patients enrolled in the initial study, 10 were excluded from analysis for various reasons. 206 patients in the nitrous oxide group and 202 patients in the nitrogen group thus completed the trial. Among these, 97 given nitrous oxide and 107 given nitrogen had initial colorectal cancer surgery and were available for this analysis (fig. 1).

Trial profile after Fleischmann E, Lenhardt R, Kurz A et al 2005.

Follow-up was conducted by investigators who were blinded to the original assignment to nitrous oxide or nitrogen. Cancer registries were reviewed, patients were contacted, and their health status confirmed with their oncologists and/or general practitioners. Family members and government authorities were contacted as necessary to determine patients' current addresses or confirm mortality. Our primary outcome was local or metastatic recurrence of colon cancer.

### Applications of nitrous oxide for procedural sedation in the pediatric population [^114QpRhK]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this review was to provide a general descriptive account of the physical properties, end-organ effects, therapeutic applications, and delivery techniques of nitrous oxide (N2O) as used in the arena of procedural sedation.

Data Source

A computerized bibliographic search regarding the applications of nitrous for provision of sedation and analgesia during procedures with an emphasis on the pediatric population was performed.

Results

The end-organ effects of N2O have been well described in the operating room setting. Aside from its effects on the central nervous system of sedation and analgesia, N2O may alter intracerebral dynamics and alter cerebral blood flow and intracranial pressure especially in patients with altered intracranial compliance. Effects on ventilation include a dose-related depression of ventilatory function and control of upper airway patency. These effects are generally limited in the absence of comorbid diseases and potentiated by other sedative and analgesic agents. The more clinically significant respiratory effect of N2O on ventilatory function is a dose-dependent depression of the ventilatory response to hypoxemia. Hemodynamic effects include a mild direct depressant effect on myocardial function, which in the absence of comorbid cardiac disease is generally compensated by stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system. Nitrous oxide may potentially aggravate pulmonary hypertension. Additional physiologic effects on neurologic and hematologic function may result in inactivation of the enzyme, methionine synthetase. Recent concern has also been raised regarding the potential effects of N2O on immune function and its relationship to perioperative surgical site infections. Given differences in the solubility, N2O will diffuse into and significantly expand gas-filled cavities. Chronic exposure of health care works to N2O is also a concern. Although there are limited data in the literature to clearly substantiate concerns regarding the reproductive toxicity of occupational exposure to N2O, appropriate scavenging and use of other techniques are mandatory. Nitrous oxide has been shown to be effective for a variety of minor surgical procedures such as venipuncture, intravenous cannula placement, lumbar puncture, bone marrow aspiration, laceration repair, dental care, and minor dermatologic procedures. It is generally as effective as midazolam, with several studies demonstrating it to be more effective. However, its utility is not as great in severely painful procedures such as fracture reduction. Demonstrated advantages to parenteral sedation include a more rapid onset and a shorter recovery time with the majority of patients preferring it to over other agents or agreeing to its use for subsequent procedures. The literature also suggests increased success rates with simple procedures such as intravenous cannula placement when compared with placebo. In general, life-threatening adverse events have not been reported. Most common adverse effects include dysphoria and vomiting. For more painful procedures, combination with another agent may be used, and in all cases, topical or infiltrative local anesthesia is recommended.

Conclusions

In general, N2O is a useful adjunct for procedural sedation. Given the variety of procedures performed in the pediatric patient, ongoing research is required to identify the most appropriate and effective use of this agent. This may be particularly relevant when evaluating its use for procedures associated with significant pain. In these scenarios, the combination of N2O with other agents needs to be evaluated. Given the potential for adverse effects, strict adherence to published guidelines regarding procedural sedation and monitoring is suggested.

### Factors to weigh in while administering nitrous oxide anesthesia [response to letter] [^1151dDoJ]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

The third point is the safety of N 2 O anesthesia. In our study, all patients included were preoperatively informed about the possibility of use of low-concentration N 2 O anesthesia during cataract surgery and the adverse effects of the anesthesia. N 2 O anesthesia has little effect on the respiratory system. In order to avoid adverse effects of N 2 O, the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommends that the percentage of N 2 O delivered should not exceed 50% concentration during procedures. In general, diffusion hypoxia is not known to occur in cataract surgery with short operating time and 30% N 2 O; however, caution should be exercised when using more than 50% N 2 O. The most frequent adverse effects of N 2 O anesthesia are nausea and vomiting. The frequency of nausea and vomiting are as low as 3.7% with 50% N 2 O. Noguchi et al also reported that no patients experienced intraoperative nausea with 30% N 2 O during cataract surgery. Although 30% low-concentration N 2 O anesthesia is considered to have fewer adverse effects than 50% or higher concentrations of N 2 O, further studies are warranted to evaluate whether randomized controlled trials of the efficacy and safety of 30% low-concentration N 2 O anesthesia during cataract surgery are consistent with our results.

### Nitrous oxide exposure does not seem to be associated with increased mortality, stroke, and myocardial infarction: a non-randomized subgroup analysis of the general anaesthesia compared with local anaesthesia for carotid surgery (GALA) trial [^112ntmPw]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Nitrous oxide has been associated with increased vascular risk in the perioperative period. Here, we conducted a secondary analysis of the GALA trial to ascertain the impact of nitrous oxide on outcomes after carotid surgery under general anaesthesia (GA).

Methods

One thousand seven hundred and seventy-three patients underwent GA, but 158 patients were excluded from this analysis as nitrous oxide use was unknown. The decision to use nitrous oxide was at the discretion of the anaesthetist and was not randomized. Six hundred and seventy-one patients received nitrous oxide and 944 patients did not. Logistic regression was used to analyse the same primary outcome as the original trial (risk of death, stroke, or myocardial infarction within 30 days of the operation).

Results

Patients who received nitrous oxide were more likely to have had coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and atrial fibrillation (all P < 0.05). Overall, there were 35 (5.2%) primary outcome events in patients receiving nitrous oxide compared with 44 (4.7%) in those who did not [relative risk 1.12, 95% confidence interval (CI: 0.73, 1.73); P = 0.63]. The adjustment for the imbalanced baseline variables using logistic regression reduced the point estimate of harm for nitrous oxide [adjusted odds ratio 1.09, 95% CI (0.68, 1.74); P = 0.73].

Conclusions

Given the greater prevalence of vascular risk factors in the nitrous oxide group and the lack of any definite effect on the primary outcome measure, these data do not support a clinically meaningful adverse effect of nitrous oxide on our composite outcome in patients undergoing carotid surgery.

### Mortality and morbidity after total intravenous anaesthesia versus inhalational anaesthesia: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115NcERF]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

The protocol of this systematic review and meta-analysis was published in the PROSPERO registry (CRD42023430492). The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used in the design and reporting.

Data sources

We searched PubMed/Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials for works published from January 1, 1985 to August 1, 2023 (full search in Appendix 1). References of studies were screened for additional records. We did not search for unpublished studies through funding agencies, trial registries or meeting abstracts.

Eligibility

We considered RCTs that included two or more groups undergoing a surgical procedure and compared different drug-regimes for anaesthesia maintenance, of which at least one was propofol-based TIVA and one IA using sevoflurane, desflurane or isoflurane. RCTs combining propofol and volatile anaesthetics during the maintenance phase of anaesthesia were excluded. Nitrous oxide was considered outside of the scope of this review. Nitrous oxide is a low-potency anaesthetic gas that is sometimes used as an adjuvant to propofol or volatile anaesthetics with little effect on postoperative outcome.RCTs were eligible for inclusion as long as the administered fraction of nitrous oxide was the same in both groups. The anaesthetic agents used for the induction of anaesthesia were also considered outside of the scope of this review. No language restrictions were applied.

### Perioperative oxygen therapy: an overview of systematic reviews and meta-analyses [^116yuaiF]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Panoramic meta-analysis

The term 'panoramic meta-analysis' was originally used to refer to a meta-analysis that evaluates the effectiveness of an intervention across different indications (e.g. type of surgery), usually using pooled results from systematic reviews focusing on different indications with an intention to test a hypothesis of a generic effect of an intervention across different indications. In this overview, we tested the hypothesis that delivery of a higher concentration of oxygen perioperatively at various time through various devices could reduce SSI across different types of surgery. We used trial-level data rather than review-level data and therefore the panoramic meta-analyses that we report in this paper are equivalent to meta-analyses with subgroups defined by types of surgery. The subgroups of surgery were determined before the commencement of analyses by the project team in consultation with the advisory panel: abdominal surgery vs caesarean section vs other surgery. Additional pre-specified subgroups that we investigated (where data available) were: oxygen delivery through tracheal intubation vs face masks or nasal cannula; use of nitrous oxide as carrier gas for anaesthesia in the control group vs no use of nitrous oxide; trials with low risk of bias vs trials with high or unclear risk of bias; and urgency of the surgery (elective vs emergency vs mixed).

We also updated additional subgroup analyses reported in the anchoring reviews where the main meta-analyses were updated. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported and presented in forest plots for each meta-analysis. A random effects model was used to account for heterogeneity that cannot readily be explained. Inconsistency across different studies within individual subgroups and across different subgroups was assessed using the I² statistic.

Two 'top-level' panoramic meta-analyses were planned for the two primary outcomes (SSI and 30-day all-cause mortality) to further aggregate the data across the three main comparisons, with pooled data from individual panoramic meta-analysis as the unit of analysis. The purpose was to explore the compatibility of all relevant evidence included in this overview with the hypothesis that perioperative exposure to higher concentrations of oxygen reduces SSI; and to gauge the overall benefit/risk of delivering more oxygen perioperatively on postoperative 30-day all-cause mortality.

### Wilderness Medical Society clinical practice guidelines for the treatment of acute pain in austere environments: 2024 update [^1113NsAm]. Wilderness & Environmental Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) in austere environments — key operational cautions and conditional use — includes temperature-related risks leading to hypoxic mixtures, decreased analgesic effect with increasing altitude, accumulation risk in poorly ventilated spaces, and a weak recommendation for limited use at low altitude with monitoring. Direct sunlight and hot temperatures can risk cylinder rupture due to overpressure, and subzero temperatures can cause liquefaction with unpredictable N2O/O2 concentrations that may become dangerously hypoxic; accordingly, N2O/O2 mixtures must be administered with care at below-freezing temperatures. Increasing altitude decreases the inhaled partial pressure of gases and thus decreases the analgesic effect of N2O, and adequate ventilation should be assured to prevent unintentional inhalation among bystanders; use on ski hills has not been reported. Recommendation: We suggest N2O as a safe and effective analgesic in austere environments for short painful procedures or for limited periods of time. Although evidence pertinent to austere use is limited, it can be safely used at low altitude, with appropriate monitoring, and where appropriate storage of cylinders can be assured (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).

Nitrous oxide (N2O) versus oxygen during sedated pediatric dental procedures — placebo-controlled crossover: Anxious children sedated with 40 mg/kg chloral hydrate and 2 mg/kg hydroxyzine received 50% N2O or 100% oxygen, with outcomes showing no significant physiologic or behavioral differences between N2O and oxygen, trends of less increase in heart rate during anesthesia injection, greater increase in ETCO2, lower behavioral scores under N2O, and significant variability in responsiveness to N2O. Study parameters included 40 visits with mean age 45 mo (age range 36–60 mo), and limitations noted a small number of patients (N = 20).

### Comprehensive review of myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery: prevention, intervention, and long-term management strategies [^111dFQ3J]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2025). Medium credibility.

Anesthetic considerations and hemodynamic management strategies

The anesthetic considerations and hemodynamic management during surgery focuses on optimizing perioperative hemodynamics, minimizing myocardial oxygen demand, avoiding hypotension, and optimizing cardiac output to reduce the risk of myocardial injury.

Regarding perioperative hemodynamics, fluid management is based on specific patient characteristics and intraoperative needs. However, the use of balanced crystalloid solutions may help anesthesiologists avoid fluid overload and further exacerbate myocardial injury. Additionally, during surgery, vasoactive agents may need to be utilized in order to maintain an adequate mean arterial and perfusion pressures. Overall, hemodynamic optimization strategies are geared towards parameters such as maintaining stroke volume, and pulse pressure variation which aids in guiding fluid resuscitation and vasopressor use to avoid excessive fluid administration.

When utilizing intraoperative anesthetics, it is imperative to minimize the use of medications that have adverse effects of depressing myocardial function, such as certain volatile anesthetics and opioids. Using regional anesthesia techniques such as epidural or spinal anesthesia in appropriate situations may provide better hemodynamic stability and reduce the need for systemic opioids during surgery; although, this has not been confirmed to prevent MINS. Additionally, choosing anesthetic agents that minimize myocardial depression such as volatile anesthetics with cardioprotective properties like sevoflurane or total intravenous anesthesia techniques with agents like propofol and remifentanil, should be preferred when preventing cardiac complications such as MINS. However, there has not been an identified link between anesthesia agent types and the prevention or development of MINS. In 2014, the Evaluation of Nitrous Oxide in the Gas Mixture for Anesthesia trial (ENIGMA-II) led by Myles and associates analyzed noncardiac surgical patients and the use of nitrous oxide during surgery. The ENIGMA-II trial found that nitrous oxide use during the intraoperative period did not increase the risk of developing MINS. Overall, future studies geared towards anesthetic agents and their association with developing MINS is necessary for preventing this common cardiac complication.

### What works and what's safe in pediatric emergency procedural sedation: an overview of reviews [^117TDt5y]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Interpretation

The choice of sedative agent depends on the efficacy and safety profile of the agent, as well as its relative safety and efficacy compared to other medications. Other practical considerations include the indication for sedation and depth of sedation required (i.e. this may vary for nonpainful, minor, and major painful procedures) and patient characteristics (e.g. preprocedural fasting; ASA physical status; and other anatomic, physiological, and developmental factors). Safe administration of any agent requires a thorough understanding of its effects, interactions, and sedation time intervals. 6 Such knowledge promotes appropriate drug administration, particularly when multiple agents are used, in titrated doses, and avoids the potential for oversedation. 24 This review focused on sedative agents commonly used in North America for children undergoing procedures in the ED.

For minor painful procedures in some cooperative children nitrous oxide was found to be safe and effective to achieve sedation and analgesia; 13, 16, 19, 20 however, another method of pain management should be prepared in case of treatment failure. 16 Nitrous oxide has significantly shorter treatment times than other modalities with rapid onset 12 and is quickly reversible. 13, 16, 20 Reported minor effects (nausea/vomiting, dizziness, voice change, dysphoria) were uncommon and major adverse effects (hypotension, oxygen desaturation) could not be attributed to nitrous oxide inhalation. 13, 16, 19 Risk factors for adverse effects included patients < 1 year old, simultaneous use of other sedatives, 19 and depth of sedation. Both a challenge and an advantage to sedation with nitrous oxide is that it may be safely given by the children themselves via a self‐administered demand valve. 4

Nitrous oxide (N2O) labor analgesia — pregnant people with opioid use disorder (OUD): Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) are not an absolute contraindication to receiving N2O labor analgesia (Class I, Level C-LD), and nitrous oxide use in laboring people with OUD should follow similar indications as patients without OUD with consideration for sedation and respiratory depression monitoring (eg, sedation scores, respiratory rate monitoring, continuous pulse oximetry) if not already utilized in institutional standard N2O protocols (Class I, Level C-EO); N2O exposure may lead to maternal sedation, hypoxemic episodes, and increased risk of respiratory depression among pregnant people receiving systemic opioids or sedatives/hypnotics, supporting the need for monitoring.

### When nitrous oxide is no laughing matter: nitrous oxide and pediatric anesthesia [^1166yrh9]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2007). Low credibility.

Although often felt to be relatively innocuous, nitrous oxide can have significant metabolic effects in settings of abnormal vitamin B12 and B12-related metabolism in children. These conditions can be genetic or environmental. Symptoms may not appear until days to weeks after exposure to nitrous oxide. Although overt genetic diseases are relatively uncommon, the implications of nitrous oxide interactions with much more frequent but less symptomatically obvious single nucleotide polymorphisms are potentially more concerning. In addition, nitrous oxide can have direct and differing neurotoxic effects on both immature and aged brain, the clinical impact of which remains undetermined.

### It's time to stop using nitrous oxide for pediatric mask induction [^117MQeAV]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Mask induction of anesthesia for pediatric patients has included the use of nitrous oxide since the inception of pediatric anesthesia. However, the use of nitrous oxide precludes adequate preoxygenation. Additionally, pediatric physiology (less Functional Residual Capacity, higher oxygen consumption), increased risk of laryngospasm and lack of intravenous access increase the risk of a severe airway complication in the event of airway occlusion. Nitrous oxide does not facilitate tranquil mask placement on an unwilling child and does not meaningfully speed mask induction. Exposure to nitrous oxide has potential occupational health concerns and nitrous oxide has significant environmental detriment.

Conclusion

Utilizing other, evidence-based, techniques to facilitate tranquil mask placement will assure that patients have a pleasant induction experience and avoiding nitrous oxide will reduce the environmental impact, as well as improve the safety of, pediatric mask induction.

### Frozen in time: a history of the synthesis of nitrous oxide and how the process remained unchanged for over 2 centuries [^111GerxT]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2018). Low credibility.

Three major factors have contributed to the unrivaled popularity of nitrous oxide (N2O) among anesthetists in the 20th century and beyond: its impressive safety profile, its affordability, and its rapid induction and emergence times. These 3 characteristics of N2O have been discussed and written about extensively throughout the medical literature. Nonetheless, the characteristic that contributed most to N2O's initial discovery-the elegance and simplicity of its synthesis-has received substantially less attention. Although N2O was first used as an anesthetic in Hartford, CT, in 1844, it had been identified and synthesized as a distinct gas in the late 18th century. In this article, we track the developments in the recognition and early synthesis of N2O, highlight the major players credited with its discovery, and examine its evolution from the late 1700s to today. The discovery and assimilation of N2O into common medical practice, alongside ether and chloroform, heralded a new paradigm in surgical medicine-one that no longer viewed pain as a fundamental component of surgical medicine. Its continued usage in modern medicine speaks to the brilliance and skill of the chemists and scientists involved in its initial discovery.

### Physiological effects of nitrous oxide on anaesthesia… [^115hw1UQ]. ClinicalTrials (2010). Low credibility.

In particular, its low solubility in body tissues gives it a unique pharmacokinetic profile, with rapid washin and washout from the body. It has been shown to have a similar effect on the speed of uptake of accompanying agents like sevoflurane, which have much slower pharmacokinetics. A recent study by us suggested that this promotes faster and smoother onset of anaesthesia, as measured using the standard monitor of depth of anaesthesia. This finding requires confirmation prospectively in a larger group of patients. The investigators further hypothesise that a similar effect also exists on washout of sevoflurane at the end of the procedure, promoting quicker recovery from anaesthesia.

The investigators hypothesise that the rate of fall of exhaled sevoflurane concentration at the end of anaesthesia will be more rapid in the group of patients breathing a gas mixture containing nitrous oxide, and that the rate of fall of BIS on induction and the rate of rise of BIS on emergence will be faster in the nitrous oxide group. It has useful analgesic properties, unlike the other agents used today, and its inclusion reduces the concentration of other agents required to maintain an adequate depth of anaesthesia for surgery. In particular, its low solubility in body tissues gives it a unique pharmacokinetic profile, with rapid washin and washout from the body. It has been shown to have a similar effect on the speed of uptake of accompanying agents like sevoflurane, which have much slower pharmacokinetics.

### Nitrous oxide-induced reproductive risks: should recreational nitrous oxide users worry? [^113JF1UZ]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Nitrous oxide (N 2 O; 'laughing gas') is a widely used anaesthetic. For over 150 years, N 2 O is used as an anaesthetic and anxiolytic in operating theatres, ambulance transport, dentistry and during labour and delivery. N 2 O has been advocated as a safe standard technique for dentistry and is particularly suitable to treat paediatric patients who are terrified of the dentist. In the United States, 87–89% of all paediatric dentists have used N 2 O.

In addition to clinical use, recreational N 2 O use has been known since the late 19th century but recently a serious increase in recreational use emerged in many countries. In the United Kingdom, N 2 O was second only to cannabis in drug use among those aged 16–24 in 2019 (April 2019–March 2020). Recreational N 2 O use became particularly popular in youngsters and adolescents because it is widely available, cheap, legal and most users are convinced that N 2 O is a safe drug. For instance, the majority (77%) of N 2 O users in the Netherlands was unaware of the drug's harmful effects. The use of hundreds of bulbs daily for prolonged periods of time and continuous filling and inhaling N 2 O balloons using large 2 kg N 2 O-tanks is emerging, though fortunately, this is still an exceptional practice among recreational N 2 O users. These new practices are of concern, because repeated exposure to high doses of N 2 O for a prolonged time is known to induce vitamin B 12 deficiency and related neurological damage, such as (irreversible) neuropathy and paralysis (for references, see).

### Inhaled nitrous oxide and labor analgesia-clinicalTrials.gov… [^113soVgh]. ClinicalTrials (2017). Low credibility.

- Reduce the need for epidural anesthesia in labor and delivery. Throughout labor, nitrous oxide will be administered during contractions.
- Anxiety
- Participant reported anxiety score, using a numerical rating scale ranging from no anxiety to severe anxiety.
- Participants crossing over from nitrous oxide to epidural. Hypothesis: The administration of nitrous oxide for labor analgesia will decrease the labor epidural anesthesia rate by 15%. Specific Aim: To determine if nitrous oxide can be an effective alternative technique for the provision of labor analgesia at Magee-Womens Hospital. Detailed Description. These pathways modulate pain in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord through alpha-2 adrenoreceptors. Anxiolytic effects are thought to be caused by inhibition of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors.

In a Swedish study involving 1, 997 parturients utilizing inhaled nitrous oxide as the sole anesthetic for labor analgesia, 37. 6% of participants reported effective pain relief. Currently, the rate of labor epidural analgesia at Magee Womens Hospital is approximately 90%. There are many advantages to the use of nitrous oxide for labor analgesia compared to an epidural. Complications associated with labor epidural analgesia can include infection, bleeding, headache, and wet-tap. These complications can result in a prolonged hospital stay that is not associated with the use of nitrous oxide for labor analgesia. One of the biggest advantages of the use of nitrous oxide for labor analgesia is the significantly lower cost to administer compared to an epidural.

In a recent article in the Birth journal, it was noted that the use of nitrous oxide is far less expensive and much simpler than epidural analgesia and does not result in complications requiring additional treatments and prolonged hospital stays. These side effects are limited through a number of fail-safe mechanisms built into the nitrous oxide machine which includes the delivery of at least 30% oxygen and 3 liters of fresh gas flow. In addition the proper use includes self administration under direct supervision of a trained provider while the nitrous oxide is in use. Study Type.

### Perioperative neurological evaluation and management to lower the risk of acute stroke in patients undergoing noncardiac, nonneurological surgery: a scientific statement from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^111Bkkkm]. Circulation (2021). High credibility.

Anesthetic agents and depth of anesthesia — human data do not show neuroprotection and suggest minimal impact on perioperative stroke risk. There is no evidence that anesthetics are neuroprotective in humans, and the evidence to date suggests anesthetic agents are neither neuroprotective nor neurotoxic and that the choice of anesthetic agent is unlikely to influence the risk of stroke in the perioperative period. In a large randomized trial, nitrous oxide did not lead to increases in the composite outcome of death and cardiovascular complications, including stroke, within 30 days or 1 year after major noncardiac surgery. The Balanced Anaesthesia Study, based on a large international trial of 6644 older patients, reported no significant difference in 1-year mortality, composite of cardiovascular outcomes, and stroke for light compared with deep general anesthesia. There is also little evidence that inhaled anesthetic agents increase the risk of perioperative neurocognitive disorder.

### Action guidance for addressing pollution from inhalational anaesthetics [^1179eGBu]. Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Nitrous oxide

Nitrous oxide is less potent than other inhalational anaesthetics and therefore must be used in high concentrations (typically 50%). It has a very long atmospheric lifetime (114 y) and, therefore, its global warming impacts are similar to desflurane in clinically relevant doses. Vast quantities of nitrous oxide are lost before clinical use via central piping manifolds. This has led to calls for decommissioning nitrous oxide central piping and avoiding de novo construction. Substituting portable tanks, and closing them between each use, is feasible and reduces losses dramatically.

Nitrous oxide use for analgesia is common outside of anaesthesia practice (e.g. labour suite, dental practice, pre‐hospital care), although the precise amount used is uncertain. Working to educate diverse professionals about nitrous oxide environmental emissions and safe, environmentally preferable alternatives is another important task for anaesthesia provider leadership.

Low‐flow anaesthesia

Historically, there has been concern about the theoretical risk of renal injury associated with compound A production when sevoflurane is used at low FGFs. This led to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommendations for minimum FGF rates of 1 l.min ‐1 for up to 2‐minimum alveolar concentration‐hours, then 2 l.min ‐1 thereafter; this resulted in the common practice of a default FGF of 2 l.min ‐1. However, there is no clinical evidence of harm associated with compound A in humans, even at low FGFs. Sevoflurane can be used safely with low FGF to minimise its environmental impact; however, it is recommended to use carbon dioxide absorbers that contain low (< 2%) or no sodium hydroxide.

Total intravenous and regional anaesthesia

The carbon impact of TIVA and/or regional anaesthesia can be substantially less than volatile‐based anaesthetic techniques, even when manufacturing, packaging, transportation, administration and waste management of consumables are considered. Non‐greenhouse gas emissions are also a concern, but perhaps less so if intravenous drug waste is incinerated as per recommendations and regulations. However, TIVA and/or regional anaesthesia are not default low carbon alternatives as consideration must be given to minimising oxygen FGF, single‐use plastics and unnecessary use of drugs and supplies. It must be noted that the use of TIVA may be associated with increased procurement costs, limiting its utility in low‐ and middle‐income countries, where the use of inhalational anaesthetics with low FGF is important.

### Clinical policy: procedural sedation and analgesia in the emergency department [^116xD3TA]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) safety in ASA I–II children — no major cardiopulmonary adverse events were reported when N2O was used alone or with local anesthesia in healthy children, including studies using 50% to 70% N2O administered by specially trained nurses; a Class III dataset of 35,828 administrations (82% children) found 9 (0.03%) serious adverse events possibly attributed to 50% N2O, with 18 more serious events thought not caused by N2O; deaths associated with N2O have been linked to inadvertent administration of 100% nitrous oxide; this safety section addresses age 1–18 years.

### The safety of addition of nitrous oxide to general anaesthesia in at-risk patients having major non-cardiac surgery (ENIgMA-II): a randomised, single-blind trial [^111cASUE]. Lancet (2014). Excellent credibility.

Background

Nitrous oxide is commonly used in general anaesthesia but concerns exist that it might increase perioperative cardiovascular risk. We aimed to gather evidence to establish whether nitrous oxide affects perioperative cardiovascular risk.

Methods

We did an international, randomised, assessor-blinded trial in patients aged at least 45 years with known or suspected coronary artery disease having major non-cardiac surgery. Patients were randomly assigned via automated telephone service, stratified by site, to receive a general anaesthetic with or without nitrous oxide. Attending anaesthetists were aware of patients' group assignments, but patients and assessors were not. The primary outcome measure was a composite of death and cardiovascular complications (non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, pulmonary embolism, or cardiac arrest) within 30 days of surgery. Our modified intention-to-treat population included all patients randomly assigned to groups and undergoing induction of general anaesthesia for surgery. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00430989.

Findings

Of 10,102 eligible patients, we enrolled 7112 patients between May 30, 2008, and Sept 28, 2013. 3543 were assigned to receive nitrous oxide and 3569 were assigned not to receive nitrous oxide. 3483 patients receiving nitrous oxide and 3509 not receiving nitrous oxide were assessed for the primary outcome. The primary outcome occurred in 283 (8%) patients receiving nitrous oxide and in 296 (8%) patients not receiving nitrous oxide (relative risk 0·96, 95% CI 0·83–1·12; p = 0·64). Surgical site infection occurred in 321 (9%) patients assigned to nitrous oxide, and in 311 (9%) patients in the no-nitrous oxide group (p = 0·61), and severe nausea and vomiting occurred in 506 patients (15%) assigned to nitrous oxide and 378 patients (11%) not assigned to nitrous oxide (p < 0·0001).

Interpretation

Our findings support the safety profile of nitrous oxide use in major non-cardiac surgery. Nitrous oxide did not increase the risk of death and cardiovascular complications or surgical-site infection, the emetogenic effect of nitrous oxide can be controlled with antiemetic prophylaxis, and a desired effect of reduced volatile agent use was shown.

### Should nitrous oxide ever be used in oncology patients receiving methotrexate therapy? [^114a72BJ]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2020). Medium credibility.

Nitrous oxide (N 2 O) is frequently used for short anesthesia/analgesia in children undergoing painful or repetitive procedures. Children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) require repeated lumbar punctures with direct instillation of intrathecal chemotherapy, usually the anti-folate agent methotrexate, during their treatment. These procedures are frequently performed under anesthesia. Concerns have been intermittently raised about a drug interaction between methotrexate and N 2 O that may potentiate the undesirable side effects of methotrexate, including neurotoxicity. However, the clinical evidence consists mainly of isolated case reports leading to a lack of consensus among pediatric anesthetists about the relative risk benefits of using N 2 O in children with ALL. In this article, we review the biochemical basis and scientific observations that suggest a significant interaction between N 2 O and methotrexate due to their dual inhibition of the key enzyme methionine synthase. The possible role of this interaction in potentiating neurotoxicity in children with cancer is discussed, and arguments and counterarguments about the clinical significance of this largely theoretical relationship are explored. Following comprehensive review of all the available data, we make the case for the circumstantial evidence being sufficiently compelling to prompt a review of practice by pediatric anesthetists and call for a precautionary approach by avoiding the use of N 2 O in children receiving concurrent methotrexate.

### Clinical policy: procedural sedation and analgesia in the emergency department [^114uiZy1]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2014). Medium credibility.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) respiratory effects and co-medication interactions — hypoxemia occurred rarely in healthy patients, and mild respiratory depression was found when N2O was co-administered with other sedative or analgesic medications; Class II studies noted increasing ETCO2 with increasing N2O concentrations in children who also received oral chloral hydrate or oral midazolam 0.7 mg/kg but not 0.5 mg/kg; young children receiving oral midazolam 0.5 mg/kg + 50% N2O for facial laceration repair had no significant respiratory effects; after 30 minutes of 40% N2O, room air versus O2 "wash out" showed no clinically significant difference in oxygen saturations; studies in healthy children undergoing elective dental procedures found no significant adverse events when N2O was combined with other low-dose sedatives, although safety for procedural sedation in the emergency department is not clear.

Evidentiary table — nitrous oxide for pediatric laceration repair (Gamis et al., 1989) summarizes a prospective, double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial in the ED including 34 patients, mean age around 7 y, with 15 received N2O. The intervention compared 30% N2O vs oxygen placebo for children 2–16 y of age undergoing laceration repair with local anesthesia. Patients > 8 y had less distress during suturing (P < 0.05), while patients < 8 y had a trend toward less distress with N2O that did not reach significance, and no emesis, hypoxia, oversedation, or adverse events were observed. Limitations included small sample size, N2O 30%, and that use of mask with oxygen in controls may have increased patient anxiety, thus enhancing apparent N2O benefit.

### Principles of environmentally-sustainable anaesthesia: a global consensus statement from the world federation of societies of anaesthesiologists [^117RawPC]. Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Anaesthesia providers should minimise the environmental impact of their clinical practice

The Working Group reached consensus that:
Anaesthesia providers should lead by example on 'green' issues, both personally and professionally.
Anaesthesia providers and their professional bodies should publicly advocate environmentally sustainable healthcare.
Anaesthesia providers should collaborate within multidisciplinary sustainability teams to improve anaesthesia sustainability (e.g. with other specialties, industry, construction, environmentalists).
As members of hospital sustainability committees, anaesthesia providers should both promote and procure measurable reductions in the wastage of drugs, single‐use equipment and energy.
There should be a lead individual for sustainability in each department of anaesthesia.

Anaesthesia is integral to the provision of healthcare but makes a significant and measurable contribution to environmental pollution. Several national health sector studies have demonstrated that the life‐cycle of the healthcare supply chain (including the resource extraction, manufacture, packaging, distribution, use/reuse and disposal) accounts for approximately 70% of total healthcare emissions. Anaesthesia providers use significant quantities of medical supplies and pharmaceuticals. Waste anaesthestic gases alone have been found to account for 3% of all health sector greenhouse gas emissions in England (where the most rigorous national accounting has occurred, to date). Anaesthesia providers therefore have critical roles to play in reducing the environmental impact of their practice. The Working Group agreed that anaesthesia providers should both lead on environmentally sustainable practice and collaborate with colleagues and other stakeholders on individual, departmental, regional, national and international levels.

Anaesthesia providers should use environmentally preferable medications and equipment when clinically safe to do so

The Working Group reached consensus that:
Anaesthesia providers should always consider how they can safely reduce the amount of drugs, equipment, energy and water used in their practice, for environmental reasons.
Anaesthesia drugs should be disposed of in an environmentally sustainable manner.
For inhalational general anaesthesia, anaesthesia providers should use the (single) agent with the lowest global warming potential (GWP 100, i.e. halothane or sevoflurane before isoflurane, and isoflurane in preference to desflurane).
Anaesthesia providers should use low oxygen/air flows during sedation and general anaesthesia, appropriate for the delivery system used.
If used, anaesthesia nitrous oxide sources and piping should be routinely leak‐checked
All areas where inhalational anaesthesia is administered should be fitted with expired/waste agent scavenging and trapping/destruction equipment.
In countries where they are available, desflurane and nitrous oxide should be used in specific agreed cases only (rather than not be used or be freely available for use).

### Action guidance for addressing pollution from inhalational anaesthetics [^116LdtQx]. Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Recommendations

1 Resource stewardship presents an opportunity for leadership and environmental action by providers of anaesthesia. This acknowledges globally limited resources, the contribution of the healthcare sector to climate change and the impact of climate change on healthcare.
2 If inhalational anaesthetics are used, providers should avoid those with disproportionately high climate impacts, such as desflurane and nitrous oxide. Further, desflurane is more expensive than other volatile anaesthetics, with little evidence of clinical benefit justifying its use, and avoidance may have a cost savings benefit.
3 Most nitrous oxide is lost prior to use through central piping systems that should be decommissioned in existing infrastructure and avoided in new construction. Portable canisters should be substituted, and these should be closed between uses to avert continuous leaks.
4 If inhalational anaesthetics are used, the lowest possible fresh gas flow (FGF) rates should be selected during all stages of anaesthesia (e.g. < 1 l.min ‐1 during maintenance). To speed induction, low flows can be combined with high concentrations. Lower flows will, however, result in faster consumption of traditional carbon dioxide absorbers.
5 Regional anaesthesia and total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) are alternatives with fewer embodied greenhouse gases, even accounting for additional consumable materials. Care should be taken to avoid unnecessary high flow rates of oxygen in patients who are maintaining their own airway during anaesthesia, as this can add considerably to the resultant greenhouse gas emissions.
6 More research is needed before recommending investment in waste anaesthetic gas capture (for volatiles only) or destruction (nitrous oxide only) technology. Avoidance of inhalational anaesthetics, decommissioning centralised nitrous oxide and reduction of FGFs are higher mitigation priorities than waste treatment technological solutions.
7 Inhalational anaesthetic greenhouse gas emissions should be measured at institutional and provider levels, and performance improvement tracked, with clear guidance on science‐based targets and timelines for mitigation.

### Safety of nitrous oxide anesthesia in a selected group of patients undergoing neurosurgery: an exploratory subgroup analysis of the ENIgMA trials [^113j5uDp]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

The Evaluation of Nitrous Oxide in the Gas Mixture for Anesthesia (ENIGMA)-I and ENIGMA-II were randomized clinical trials that assessed the safety of nitrous oxide anesthesia in patients undergoing noncardiac surgery. In this study, we performed an exploratory pooled analysis of both ENIGMA trials to assess the safety of nitrous oxide in a selected group of patients undergoing neurosurgery.

Methods

Data from each ENIGMA trial were collated into a single database. Information regarding patient demographics, comorbidities, medication use, anesthesia, surgical procedure, and postoperative complications was extracted. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted for postoperative complications to assess the risk associated with nitrous oxide.

Results

A total of 830 patients were included in our analysis: 417 received nitrous oxide anesthesia, and 413 received nitrous oxide-free anesthesia. Baseline patient and perioperative characteristics were comparable. Procedural data were available for 535 patients (64%); of these, 507 (95%) underwent spinal neurosurgery and 28 (5%) underwent cranial neurosurgery. Patients in the nitrous oxide group had lower inspired oxygen concentration (30% vs. 38%; P < 0.001) and end-tidal volatile agent concentration (0.56 vs. 0.89 minimal alveolar concentration equivalents; P < 0.001) compared with the nitrous oxide-free group. Use of nitrous oxide was not associated with increased risk of postoperative complications (myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, stroke, infection, severe vomiting, fever, pneumonia, pneumothorax, blood transfusion, venous thromboembolism, or death) (odds ratio: 1.22; 95% confidence interval: 0.89–1.65; P = 0.22) or prolonged length of hospital stay (median 5.0 vs. 4.2d for nitrous oxide and nitrous oxide-free groups; P = 0.28).

Conclusion

Nitrous oxide did not increase the risk of postoperative complications or prolonged length of hospital stay in the neurosurgical cohort enrolled in the ENIGMA-I and ENIGMA-II trials.

### Rare but relevant: nitrous oxide and peripheral neurotoxicity, what do we know? [^114evHNC]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Nitrous oxide (N 2 O), used medically as an anaesthetic, has gained popularity as a recreational drug, with rising prevalence particularly among young adults. While its reinforcing and addictive potential remains debated, N 2 O is proven to be neurotoxic, especially with prolonged, heavy use, which is often unexpected for users. The neurotoxicological mechanism underlying N 2 O‐induced neurotoxicity involves inactivation of vitamin B 12 (cobalamin), which disrupts methionine synthesis, essential for maintaining the myelin sheath. This can result in demyelinating diseases, including generalized demyelinating polyneuropathy (GDP). Clinical incidence of N 2 O‐induced peripheral neuropathy is largely unknown, although some research suggests it is not uncommon. Treatment includes immediate cessation of N 2 O use and vitamin B 12 supplementation. Although this treatment often reverses damage, residual symptoms such as limb weakness may persist. Additionally, genetic and dietary factors, such as vitamin B 12 deficiency, may heighten individual vulnerability for N 2 O's detrimental effects.

### Rare but relevant: nitrous oxide and peripheral neurotoxicity, what do we know? [^113hSzFU]. Addiction (2025). Medium credibility.

INTRODUCTION

Nitrous oxide, or N 2 O, has been used in medicine for its anaesthetic effect ascribed to its blockade of the glutamate N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NDMA)‐receptors. As a volatile gas, it is administered, in a 50% mixture with oxygen, as an inhalant in certain routine surgical procedures (e.g. dentistry, delivery). Since its application as anaesthetic it has also been used recreationally for its relaxant effects and mild euphoria. However, no reinforcing effects of N 2 O were found. In fact, evidence claiming an addictive potential of N 2 O is rather weak and not based on convincing epidemiological evidence with very few people in treatment for N 2 O abuse or dependence, but primarily on N 2 O's putative interaction with the opioid system and NMDA‐receptor antagonism. A recent study tried to make a case for N 2 O use fulfilling some Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition criteria, but this was disputed by others. However, depending on the dose administered, N 2 O may be harmful in other ways.

The prevalence of recreational N 2 O use has increased over the last decades, with a steady increase among adolescents and young adults worldwide. In 2020, last year N 2 O use in adolescents (16–24 years) was 8.7% in England and Wales, which implies that N 2 O was second only to cannabis. Similar findings were reported for French students (14%). In the Netherlands, there was also a high prevalence with 9.9% among adolescents (12–18 years) in 2019, however, this has declined sharply to 3.1% in 2023.

The Dutch Poisons Information Centre reported a steep increase in N 2 O intoxications from 0.12% in 2010 to 11% in 2020, whereas the Poisons Control Centre in France reported an exponential increase in N 2 O intoxications from 46 in 2019 to 134 in 2020 and an increase in severe cases from 70% in 2020 to 78% in 2021. Recent increases in N 2 O intoxications are also reported in other countries, including Australia, the United States and China. A recent review provided a thorough overview of these increases in prevalence of use, incidents and poisonings worldwide.

### What works and what's safe in pediatric emergency procedural sedation: an overview of reviews [^117TQnnV]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Overall, the quality of the included reviews was poor with 12 of the 14 reviews scoring 4 or less out of 11 on the AMSTAR tool (Table 2). Two reviews scored 7 out of 11. 12, 20 The majority of reviews met the criteria for appropriate methods used to combine studies (14/14) and reported characteristics of included studies (12/14). Fewer reviews met the criteria for incorporated scientific quality into the conclusions (9/14), performed a comprehensive search (5/14), assessed scientific quality of included studies (5/14), and provided an a priori design (3/14). Only one review satisfied the criteria for duplicate study selection and data extraction, searched for studies regardless of publication type, provided a list of included and excluded studies, and reported conflicts of interest. No review assessed for publication bias.

Table 2
Methodologic Quality of Included Systematic Reviews

Adverse events are reported in Tables 3, 4, 5. Many systematic reviews reported on a variety of measures to reflect sedation efficacy. Due to the heterogeneity of methods used to report these outcomes, it was challenging to report efficacy data in a meaningful and concise manner; therefore, we summarized efficacy based on the conclusions of the reviews (Table 6). The following sections provide a synthesis based on the primary drug of interest.

Conclusions on Safety and Efficacy of the Included Reviews

Nitrous oxide was examined in five reviews (nine studies, 8,220 sedations). 12, 13, 16, 19, 20 All five reviews concluded that nitrous oxide can be safely used in procedural sedation outside the operating room. Authors agreed that the occurrence of serious adverse events were uncommon and that onset and recovery times were faster than other treatment modalities. Three reviews commented on efficacy, and overall found it was an effective agent. 13, 16, 20 Pedersen et al. 16 noted that nitrous oxide may not be equally effective for all children. The NICE review stated that nitrous oxide was not more effective than oxygen alone in sedating uncooperative children, but could be successfully used in a wide range of procedures for cooperative children. 20

Procedural sedation and analgesia in children using 50% nitrous oxide (N2O) — a prospective multicenter cohort (46 institutions), most in emergency departments (EDs) and oncology clinics, with age ≤ 18 y — was evaluated via an 18-mo review of standardized records with major adverse events defined as airway obstruction, desaturation, apnea, cardiovascular changes, and loss of verbal contact. Results reported 7,511 patients (2,095 in ED for laceration repair, fracture reduction, abscess incision and drainage), 75 (1%) failed sedation, major adverse events 0.33% with all brief and no airway interventions, and increased major adverse event if patient age < 1 y (P = 0.001) or if opioid+benzodiazepine also given (P = 0.04). Limitations noted were unclear monitoring (eg, oxygen saturations, vital signs), and the class designation was Efficacy N/A and Safety II.

### Nitrous oxide and long-term morbidity and mortality in the ENIgMA trial [^111v4Dhb]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2011). Low credibility.

Background

There is a plausible pathophysiologic rationale for increased long-term cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients receiving significant exposure to nitrous oxide. However, this relationship has not been established clinically. The ENIGMA trial randomized 2050 patients having noncardiac surgery lasting more than 2 hours to nitrous oxide-based or nitrous oxide-free anesthesia. We conducted a follow-up study of the ENIGMA patients to evaluate the risk of cardiovascular events in the longer term.

Methods

The trial case report forms and medical records of all study patients were reviewed. The date and cause of death and occurrence of myocardial infarction or stroke were recorded. A telephone interview was then conducted with all surviving patients. The primary endpoint of the study was survival.

Results

The median follow-up time was 3.5 (range: 0 to 5.7) years. Three hundred eighty patients (19%) had died since the index surgery, 91 (4.5%) were recorded as having myocardial infarction, and 44 (2.2%) had a stroke during the entire follow-up period. Nitrous oxide did not significantly increase the risk of death [hazard ratio = 0.98 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.80 to 1.20; P = 0.82)]. The adjusted odds ratio for myocardial infarction in patients administered nitrous oxide was 1.59 (95% CI: 1.01 to 2.51; P = 0.04) and for stroke was 1.01 (95% CI: 0.55 to 1.87; P = 0.97).

Conclusions

The administration of nitrous oxide was associated with increased long-term risk of myocardial infarction, but not of death or stroke in patients enrolled in the ENIGMA trial. The exact relationship between nitrous oxide administration and serious long-term adverse outcomes will require confirmation by an appropriately designed large randomized controlled trial.

### The environmental impacts of anesthesia [^117PR8DG]. Current Opinion in Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The healthcare sector has a substantial environmental footprint, and the delivery of anesthesia contributes significantly. Inhaled anesthetics themselves are potent greenhouse gases, unused intravenous medication exert toxic effects on the environment, and the increasing reliance on single-use devices has led to an ever-growing amount of solid waste produced in operating rooms. This review discusses many of these environmental impacts and suggests practices to mitigate the environmental footprint of anesthetic practice.

Recent Findings

The choice of anesthesia maintenance has significant environmental implications, with nitrous oxide and desflurane having the highest carbon footprint of all anesthetic agents. Using low fresh gas flows and supplementing or replacing inhalational agents with propofol leads to a significant reduction in emissions. Many intravenous anesthetic agents pose a risk of environmental toxicity, and efforts should be made to decrease medication waste and ensure appropriate disposal of unused medications to minimize their environmental impacts. Additionally, consideration should be given to replacing single-use devices in the operating rooms with reusable alternatives that are often both environmentally and economically superior. And solid waste generated in the operating room should be segregated thoughtfully, as processing regulated medical waste is a highly energy-intensive process.

Summary

Significant opportunities exist to improve the environmental footprint of anesthesia practice, and with the rapidly worsening climate crisis, the importance of implementing changes is greater than ever.

### The association between nitrous oxide and postoperative mortality and morbidity after noncardiac surgery [^113wxVgY]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Nitrous oxide (N2O) has been widely used in clinical anesthesia for > 150 years. However, use of N2O has decreased in recent years because of concern about the drug's metabolic side effects. But evidence that routine use of N2O causes clinically important toxicity remains elusive. We therefore evaluated the relationship between intraoperative N2O administration and 30-day mortality as well as a set of major inpatient postoperative complications (including mortality) in adults who had general anesthesia for noncardiac surgery.

Methods

We evaluated 49,016 patients who had noncardiac surgery at the Cleveland Clinic between 2005 and 2009. Among 37,609 qualifying patients, 16,961 were given N2O ("nitrous", 45%) and 20,648 were not ("nonnitrous", 55%). Ten thousand seven hundred fifty-five nitrous patients (63% of the total) were propensity score-matched with 10,755 nonnitrous patients. Matched nitrous and nonnitrous patients were compared on 30-day mortality and a set of 8 in-hospital morbidity/mortality outcomes.

Results

Inhalation of N2O intraoperatively was associated with decreased odds of 30-day mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 97.5% confidence interval, 0.67, 0.46–0.97; P = 0.02). Furthermore, nitrous patients had an estimated 17% (OR: 0.83, 0.74–0.92) decreased odds of experiencing major in-hospital morbidity/mortality than nonnitrous (P < 0.001). Among the individual morbidities, intraoperative N2O use was only associated with significantly lower odds of having pulmonary/respiratory morbidities (OR, 95% Bonferroni-adjusted CI: 0.59, 0.44–0.78).

Conclusions

Intraoperative N2O administration was associated with decreased odds of 30-day mortality and decreased odds of in-hospital mortality/morbidity. Aside from its specific and well-known contraindications, the results of this study do not support eliminating N2O from anesthetic practice.

Nitrous oxide (N2O) analgesia — Annequin et al. prospective multicenter cohort in outpatient clinics, hemato-oncology, and the emergency department (ED) with patients ages ≤ 18 y — used fixed 50% N2O and found overall median pain VAS 9/100 by patients and 1/10 by RNs and parents, staff satisfaction 88%, and minor adverse effects in 37% (euphoria 20%, nausea/vomiting 4%, deep sedation 2%) with no serious adverse effects; limitations included no oxygen saturation monitoring and no standard protocol for N2O administration or patient monitoring, in 1,019 sedations across 31 centers.

### Views of people who have given birth on the environmental and occupational exposure risks of nitrous oxide for labour analgesia: an interview-based qualitative study [^115feMJN]. Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Participants felt that an individual's pain management should be prioritised over the environmental effects of nitrous oxide. Knowing about these effects may not be " enough to convince me to get an epidural " (Participant 4). Some participants, however, felt that knowledge of the environmental impact of nitrous oxide may affect the point at which they start to use it or the duration of time which they use it for, for example " if you're early on in your labour, [you might think] do I really need it at this point? " (Participant 3).

Participants thought that mitigation strategies should maintain the benefits of nitrous oxide for labour analgesia in a safe way. Participants wanted to know that any new technology offered to them " was a bit tried and tested " (Participant 5) with " enough evidence to share that it was safe " (Participant 8). All participants would be happy to use nitrous oxide mitigation strategies " if the effect [of nitrous oxide] is still the same " (Participant 2). This includes the non‐analgesic benefits of nitrous oxide, such as having " something to focus on " (Participant 4), being " something that you can self‐administer " (Participant 3) and the ability to remain mobile whilst using it. For one participant, for example, " if the alternative [mitigation strategy] meant that I couldn't be walking around, or I couldn't be in and out of the pool and I had to be in a fixed position in order to use the alternative [mitigation] technology… I would probably choose not to use it " (Participant 12).

Theme: institutions have a responsibility to mitigate nitrous oxide harm

Participants felt that the responsibility to protect midwives from occupational risk is not " the concern of the labouring woman ", but "… is the concern of the institution they work for " (Participant 12). Occupational risk " should probably be thought of at a… more senior systemic level within the NHS… rather than putting the responsibility on women who are in labour… " (Participant 6). Participants' responses regarding whether pregnant people should be informed of the occupational exposure risks of nitrous oxide were mixed, with many respondents imagining that this would be a " difficult conversation to have [with your midwife] " (Participant 10) and might make them " feel guilty about my choice of pain relief because of the effects on staff that were… out of my control " (Participant 4).

### Perioperative care of patients at high risk for stroke during or after non-cardiac, non-neurologic surgery: consensus statement from the society for neuroscience in anesthesiology and critical care* [^115CJazZ]. Journal of Neurosurgical Anesthesiology (2014). Medium credibility.

Anesthetic technique — general versus neuraxial and nitrous oxide — reports that stroke incidence was 0.07% with neuraxial anesthesia compared to 0.12% with combined neuraxial/general anesthesia and 0.13% with general anesthesia (p = 0.006), and in 18,745 consecutive joint replacements general anesthesia was an independent predictor of postoperative stroke (OR 3.54, 95% CI 1.01–12.39); however, in the GALA carotid endarterectomy trial there was no difference in stroke rates between general and regional anesthesia. Recommendations specify that nitrous oxide use has not been associated with an increased incidence of perioperative stroke (Category B, Level 1) and that neuraxial techniques may be associated with a lower incidence of perioperative stroke for hip and knee arthroplasty (Category B, Level 1), with no such data for other surgical populations.

### Nitrous oxide: are we still in equipoise? A qualitative review of current controversies [^112oucZY]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2013). Low credibility.

This review considers the current position of nitrous oxide in anaesthetic practice and balances potential beneficial and disadvantageous effects. The classic adverse characteristics of nitrous oxide, such as diffusion hypoxia, expansion of gas-filled spaces, and postoperative nausea and vomiting, are often cited as reasons to avoid this old drug. Recent concerns regarding neurotoxicity, adverse cardiovascular outcomes, and wound complications have further hardened many practitioners against nitrous oxide. New evidence and underpinning mechanistic data, however, suggest potential beneficial effects on the central nervous system, cardiovascular system, and acute and chronic pain. While we await the outcome of large studies including ENIGMA-II, many clinicians have already decided against this agent. The authors argue that this abandonment may be premature. Clinical Trial Registration None required.

### Factors to weigh in while administering nitrous oxide anesthesia [letter] [^117D3C89]. Clinical Ophthalmology (2022). Medium credibility.

Secondly, the amount of anesthesia required to maintain a clinically acceptable level of sedation differs from patient to patient, and generally, patients who exhibit a high level of preoperative anxiety require a higher dosage. Sasajima et al gave the same dosage of anesthesia (4% xylocaine eye drop) and failed to take into account this important parameter, so we believe this study is prone to bias. A study by Maranets et al concluded patients exhibiting higher anxiety preoperatively while undergoing bilateral laparoscopic tubal ligation require a higher dosage of anaesthesia.

Thirdly, nitrous oxide anesthesia has its drawbacks such as respiratory depression, diffusion hypoxia and postoperative nausea, so we believe that the cohort receiving the N2O anesthesia should have been made aware of these consequences before being administered the anaesthesia.

While no patients in this study reported any side effects with the use of nitrous oxide, we believe that a large trial consisting of more patients should be conducted at multiple centers before approving the use of nitrous oxide in reducing pain and anxiety during cataract surgery.

### Nitrous oxide and serious long-term morbidity and mortality in the evaluation of nitrous oxide in the gas mixture for anaesthesia (ENIgMA)-II trial [^116hEfmj]. Anesthesiology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The Evaluation of Nitrous Oxide in the Gas Mixture for Anaesthesia (ENIGMA)-II trial randomly assigned 7,112 noncardiac surgery patients at risk of perioperative cardiovascular events to 70% N2O or 70% N2 groups. The aim of this follow-up study was to determine the effect of nitrous oxide on a composite primary outcome of death and major cardiovascular events at 1 yr after surgery.

Methods

One-year follow-up was conducted via a medical record review and telephone interview. Disability was defined as a Katz index of independence in activities of daily living score less than 8. Adjusted odds ratios and hazard ratios were calculated as appropriate for primary and secondary outcomes.

Results

Among 5,844 patients evaluated at 1 yr, 435 (7.4%) had died, 206 (3.5%) had disability, 514 (8.8%) had a fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, and 111 (1.9%) had a fatal or nonfatal stroke during the 1-yr follow-up period. Exposure to nitrous oxide did not increase the risk of the primary outcome (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.94 to 1.25; P = 0.27), disability or death (odds ratio, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.90 to 1.27; P = 0.44), death (hazard ratio, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.97 to 1.43; P = 0.10), myocardial infarction (odds ratio, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.17; P = 0.78), or stroke (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.58; P = 0.70).

Conclusion

These results support the long-term safety of nitrous oxide administration in noncardiac surgical patients with known or suspected cardiovascular disease.

### A factorial trial of six interventions for the prevention of postoperative nausea and vomiting [^1175dAuv]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2004). Excellent credibility.

Background

Untreated, one third of patients who undergo surgery will have postoperative nausea and vomiting. Although many trials have been conducted, the relative benefits of prophylactic antiemetic interventions given alone or in combination remain unknown.

Methods

We enrolled 5199 patients at high risk for postoperative nausea and vomiting in a randomized, controlled trial of factorial design that was powered to evaluate interactions among as many as three antiemetic interventions. Of these patients, 4123 were randomly assigned to 1 of 64 possible combinations of six prophylactic interventions: 4 mg of ondansetron or no ondansetron; 4 mg of dexamethasone or no dexamethasone; 1.25 mg of droperidol or no droperidol; propofol or a volatile anesthetic; nitrogen or nitrous oxide; and remifentanil or fentanyl. The remaining patients were randomly assigned with respect to the first four interventions. The primary outcome was nausea and vomiting within 24 hours after surgery, which was evaluated blindly.

Results

Ondansetron, dexamethasone, and droperidol each reduced the risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting by about 26 percent. Propofol reduced the risk by 19 percent, and nitrogen by 12 percent; the risk reduction with both of these agents (i.e., total intravenous anesthesia) was thus similar to that observed with each of the antiemetics. All the interventions acted independently of one another and independently of the patients' baseline risk. Consequently, the relative risks associated with the combined interventions could be estimated by multiplying the relative risks associated with each intervention. Absolute risk reduction, though, was a critical function of patients' baseline risk.

Conclusions

Because antiemetic interventions are similarly effective and act independently, the safest or least expensive should be used first. Prophylaxis is rarely warranted in low-risk patients, moderate-risk patients may benefit from a single intervention, and multiple interventions should be reserved for high-risk patients.

### Chronic postsurgical pain in the evaluation of nitrous oxide in the gas mixture for anaesthesia (ENIgMA)-II trial [^1141bbUv]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Previous animal and clinical studies showed that nitrous oxide may produce long-term analgesia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of nitrous oxide in preventing chronic postsurgical pain. We also explored whether methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene polymorphisms (1298A > C, 667C > T) would enhance nitrous oxide analgesia.

Methods

We conducted a telephone interview at 12 months after surgery on 2924 (41.1%) patients enrolled in the Evaluation of Nitrous Oxide in the Gas Mixture for Anaesthesia-II trial. Pain at the wound site was recorded using the modified brief pain inventory and the neuropathic pain questionnaire. General health status was measured using the EQ-5D questionnaire. Genotyping was performed in a subset of 674 Asian patients in Hong Kong.

Results

At 12 months after surgery, 356 (12.2%) patients reported chronic postsurgical pain at the wound site and 112 (3.8%) patients had severe pain and required regular analgesic interventions. Nitrous oxide did not affect the rate of chronic postsurgical pain (11.8% nitrous oxide group; 12.5% no nitrous oxide group), relative risk (95% confidence intervals): 0.94 (0.75–1.17), P = 0.57. However, in a planned subgroup analysis, nitrous oxide reduced the risk of chronic postsurgical pain in Asian patients, relative risk (95% confidence intervals): 0.70 (0.50–0.98), P = 0.031. Patients who were homozygous for either gene polymorphism and who received nitrous oxide during surgery were less likely to report chronic postsurgical pain.

Conclusions

Nitrous oxide administration had no impact on chronic postsurgical pain, but benefits may still be possible in Asian patients and patients with variants in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene.

### Anesthesia and long-term outcomes after neonatal intensive care [^111a34tS]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Direct toxic effects of anesthetic agents

Working from first principles that analgesia is good is fine as long as there is confidence in the safety of the agents used. Morphine, alfentanyl, and other opioid agents have been associated with cardiovascular adverse events and should be used with care and monitoring. Of more concern is the preclinical work that indicated the association of apoptosis with the administration of NMDA blockers, such as ketamine. Subsequently, nitrous oxide, midazolam, propofol, and isofluorane have all been found to produce similar effects in infant rodent models, associated with NMDA blockade and GABA A agonists. Indeed, only dexmedetomidine seems not to be associated with the generation of apoptosis. Further studies have demonstrated long-term cognitive effects in these rodent models from ketamine, phenobarbitone, and inhalational anesthetics. There is equally a large body of evidence that morphine may also induce similar changes even allowing for a different mode of action.

Evaluating putative effects of anesthetic agents in human studies is considerably more difficult, particularly as there are unlikely to be randomized trials against placebo, and many other influences conspire to put the very preterm baby at risk of later neuromorbidity. In a large group of studies largely not structured to assess specific effects of individual agents, the need for surgery is associated with adverse outcomes. Furthermore, to demonstrate differences in neurological outcomes requires large trial sizes, and disentangling the effect of sedation/anesthesia from the reasons for the therapy is nigh on impossible, although putative designs have been proposed.

Selection of babies for anesthetic/surgical procedures demands a careful risk benefit assessment. Whereas it is unclear as to the extent of direct toxic effect from agents used, there is a clear need to provide adequate analgesia/anesthesia during procedures. For relatively frequent conditions, such as PDA ligation, preterm laparotomy, or herniotomy, there should be sufficient patient numbers in large surgical services to facilitate comparison of different techniques and harnessing neonatal follow-up services to provide long-term outcomes is entirely possible. Local and regional anesthesia and minimally invasive techniques may help to minimize exposure to systemic drugs and minimize long-term risk; they may be relatively easily subjected to randomized trials and with appropriate stratification, for example, by gestational age, may help to answer some of the conundrums posed above.

### Oxygenation practices during general anesthesia in pediatric patients: an international survey in Europe, USA, Australia, and New Zealand [^117SiYEt]. Paediatric Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

Over time, perioperative safety has improved by developments in monitoring, equipment, and medication. However, the approach to oxygen administration may not have kept pace with these improvements. The use of nitrous oxide has declined, which means that the risk of hypoxia has been reduced. Nevertheless, anesthesiologists are continuing to use high levels of oxygen, first and foremost during the induction and emergence phase. Hypoxia during induction and emergence remains a substantial concern. Careful monitoring, as well as appropriate oxygenation strategies, can mitigate the risks of severe complications like bradycardia or cardiac arrest, especially in the context of airway management. There is very limited evidence for the feasibility of low FiO 2 during induction and maintenance in the neonatal population, as shown in a small RCT. However, the benefits of supplemental oxygenation for airway management have extensively been highlighted in recent literature, especially in neonates and infants. A recent joint guideline on airway management in neonates and infants emphasizes this importance, with a strong recommendation on supplemental oxygen during tracheal intubation through apneic oxygenation. Post‐operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) could be a reason to apply a higher FiO 2 during anesthesia. Although extensively investigated in adults, this finding remains controversial. In pediatric anesthesia, the available evidence is also pointing towards no positive effects of supplemental oxygen on PONV as well. Other evidence from perioperative care shows that lower oxygen concentrations are associated with less atelectasis formation, although not every study conducted on this topic confirms this observation. Postoperative lung function is also impaired in older children who received a higher FiO 2 perioperatively.

### Chronic postsurgical pain after nitrous oxide anesthesia [^117NxVhA]. Pain (2011). Low credibility.

Nitrous oxide is an antagonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor and may prevent the development of chronic postsurgical pain. We conducted a follow-up study in the Evaluation of Nitrous Oxide in the Gas Mixture for Anaesthesia (ENIGMA) trial patients to evaluate the preventive analgesic efficacy of nitrous oxide after major surgery. The ENIGMA trial was a randomized controlled trial of nitrous oxide-based or nitrous oxide-free general anesthesia in patients presenting for noncardiac surgery lasting more than 2 hours. Using a structured telephone interview, we contacted all ENIGMA trial patients recruited in Hong Kong (n = 640). We recorded the severity of postsurgical pain of at least 3 months' duration that was not due to disease recurrence or a pre-existing pain syndrome, using the modified Brief Pain Inventory. The impact of postsurgical pain on quality of life was also measured. Pain intensity, opioid and other analgesic requirements during the first week of surgery, were retrieved from the trial case report form and medical records. A total of 46 (10.9%) patients reported pain that persisted from the index surgery, and 39 (9.2%) patients had severe pain. In addition, patients with chronic pain rated poorly in all attributes of the quality-of-life measures compared with those who were pain free. In a multivariate analysis, nitrous oxide decreased the risk of chronic postsurgical pain. In addition, severe pain in the first postoperative week, wound complication, and abdominal incision increased the risk of chronic pain. In conclusion, chronic postsurgical pain was common after major surgery in the ENIGMA trial. Intraoperative nitrous oxide administration was associated with a reduced risk of chronic postsurgical pain.

### Biologic effects of nitrous oxide: a mechanistic and toxicologic review [^113gzBdT]. Anesthesiology (2008). Low credibility.

Nitrous oxide is the longest serving member of the anesthesiologist's pharmacologic armamentarium but remains a source of controversy because of fears over its adverse effects. Recently, the Evaluation of Nitrous oxide In a Gas Mixture for Anaesthesia (ENIGMA) trial reported that nitrous oxide use increases postoperative complications; further preclinical reports have suggested that nitrous oxide may contribute to neurocognitive dysfunction in the young and elderly. Therefore, nitrous oxide's longevity in anesthetic practice is under threat. In this article, the authors discuss the evidence for the putative toxicity of nitrous oxide, from either patient or occupational exposure, within the context of the mechanism of nitrous oxide's action. Although it would seem prudent to avoid nitrous oxide in certain vulnerable populations, current evidence in support of a more widespread prescription from clinical practice is unconvincing.

### Optimal perioperative management of the geriatric patient: a best practices guideline from the American college of surgeons NSQIP and the American Geriatrics Society [^112m5TMx]. Journal of the American College of Surgeons (2016). Medium credibility.

Perioperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) in older adults — risk assessment and prevention are emphasized: The risk factors for postoperative nausea and vomiting should be assessed in all older adult patients undergoing a surgical procedure, and there are several tools available that can assist with objective assessment of risk, including the Apfel and Koivuranta tools. Risk factors for PONV include patient-specific: Female gender; Nonsmoking status; History of PONV or motion sickness; Younger age (age < 50 years); and anesthetic- and surgery-related: Use of volatile anesthetics and nitrous oxide; General versus regional anesthesia; Use of intraoperative and postoperative opioids; Longer duration of surgery. Older adults at moderate or high risk for PONV should receive prophylactic interventions and risk mitigation strategies based on their baseline risk factors per guidelines and local norms. The health care team should be aware of those medications used for PONV prophylaxis and treatment that are on the American Geriatrics Society updated Beers criteria for potentially inappropriate medication use in older adults and carefully weigh their potential benefits and risks. Important in its prevention and management in older adults is appropriate risk stratification, implementation of prevention strategies, and avoidance of medications typically used this setting (for example, scopolamine) that may precipitate confusion and postoperative delirium.

### Action guidance for addressing pollution from inhalational anaesthetics [^1162JN15]. Anaesthesia (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Climate change is a real and accelerating existential danger. Urgent action is required to halt its progression, and everyone can contribute. Pollution mitigation represents an important opportunity for much needed leadership from the health community, addressing a threat that will directly and seriously impact the health and well‐being of current and future generations. Inhalational anaesthetics are a significant contributor to healthcare‐related greenhouse gas emissions and minimising their climate impact represents a meaningful and achievable intervention. A challenge exists in translating well‐established knowledge about inhalational anaesthetic pollution into practical action. CODA is a medical education and health promotion charity that aims to deliver climate action‐oriented recommendations, supported by useful resources and success stories. The CODA‐hosted platform is designed to maximise engagement of the global healthcare community and draws upon diverse experiences to develop global solutions and accelerate action. The action guidance for addressing pollution from inhalational anaesthetics is the subject of this article. These are practical, evidence‐based actions that can be undertaken to reduce the impact of pollution from inhalational anaesthetics, without compromising patient care and include: removal of desflurane from drug formularies; decommissioning central nitrous oxide piping; avoidance of nitrous oxide use; minimising fresh gas flows during anaesthesia; and prioritising total intravenous anaesthesia and regional anaesthesia when clinically safe to do so. Guidance on how to educate, implement, measure and review progress on these mitigation actions is provided, along with means to share successes and contribute to the essential, global transition towards environmentally sustainable anaesthesia.

### Does anaesthesia with nitrous oxide affect mortality or cardiovascular morbidity? A systematic review with meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis [^1174FmJR]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2014). Low credibility.

Background

The role of nitrous oxide in modern anaesthetic practice is contentious. One concern is that exposure to nitrous oxide may increase the risk of cardiovascular complications. ENIGMA II is a large randomized clinical trial currently underway which is investigating nitrous oxide and cardiovascular complications. Before the completion of this trial, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis, using Cochrane methodology, on the outcomes that make up the composite primary outcome.

Methods

We used conventional meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis (TSA). We reviewed 8282 abstracts and selected 138 that fulfilled our criteria for study type, population, and intervention. We attempted to contact the authors of all the selected publications to check for unpublished outcome data.

Results

Thirteen trials had outcome data eligible for our outcomes. We assessed three of these trials as having a low risk of bias. Using conventional meta-analysis, the relative risk of short-term mortality in the nitrous oxide group was 1.38 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.22–8.71] and the relative risk of long-term mortality in the nitrous oxide group was 0.94 (95% CI 0.80–1.10). In both cases, TSA demonstrated that the data were far too sparse to make any conclusions. There were insufficient data to perform meta-analysis for stroke, myocardial infarct, pulmonary embolus, or cardiac arrest.

Conclusion

This systematic review demonstrated that we currently do not have robust evidence for how nitrous oxide used as part of general anaesthesia affects mortality and cardiovascular complications.
