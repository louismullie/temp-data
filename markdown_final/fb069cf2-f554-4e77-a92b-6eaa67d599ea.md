## Question

What are the causes of an elevated D-dimer level?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the causes of an elevated D-dimer level. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of D-dimer generation. Then, I should verify the diagnostic performance profile and the role of pretest probability. Next, I will categorize thrombotic and non-thrombotic causes, consider special populations and context adjustments, integrate a practical decision algorithm for clinicians, and finally double-check assay and unit heterogeneity to avoid misinterpretation.

> Let me first confirm the biology so I don't build on a shaky premise. D-dimer is produced when plasmin degrades cross-linked fibrin, so a measurable increase essentially signals concomitant activation of coagulation (fibrin formation and cross-linking) and secondary fibrinolysis, which is why the test is highly sensitive to intravascular thrombus turnover but inherently non-specific for etiology.

> I need to verify the diagnostic performance in VTE algorithms so I don't overstate what a positive value means. In low-to-intermediate pretest probability patients, high-sensitivity assays reach sensitivity ≥ 97% and NPV ≥ 98%, making a normal result reliable for ruling out PE or DVT when embedded in validated pathways, whereas a positive result requires imaging rather than being diagnostic by itself [^112rULpX] [^117TJSyF] [^115J9k13].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about any one cutoff. Specificity is limited and falls further with age; many older adults exceed the conventional 500 ng/mL FEU threshold, which is why age-adjusted or pretest-adjusted strategies are used to preserve safety while improving yield, though D-dimer offers little rule-out value beyond age 80 due to very low specificity, and results depend on the assay's validated characteristics [^115cYYWv] [^112rULpX] [^114hsAB7].

> Now, I will categorize thrombotic causes carefully. Primary VTE (DVT and PE) typically elevates D-dimer proportional to clot burden, and the test is best used to exclude VTE in appropriate pretest settings; DIC is classically associated with markedly elevated D-dimer and is embedded in ISTH diagnostic and monitoring frameworks; D-dimer positivity after anticoagulation for unprovoked VTE conveys higher recurrence risk and informs duration decisions such as in PROLONG and meta-analytic data [^113YAbo3] [^116Mqtnj].

> Let me check special thromboembolic and vascular entities so I don't miss important differentials. In suspected cerebral venous thrombosis, D-dimer can support diagnosis but is not reliable in isolated headache or prolonged symptom duration; in acute aortic dissection, D-dimer is frequently elevated and tends to correlate with extent and false lumen status; after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, higher D-dimer tracks with systemic complications and worse functional outcomes [^111vvojr] [^111hZa6Z] [^116oktvR] [^116d7n4g].

> Next, I will examine malignancy because it is a common non-VTE driver. Active cancer chronically activates coagulation, so D-dimer is often elevated even without demonstrable thrombosis; very high levels, especially above 8000 ng/mL FEU, associate with occult malignancy and reduced survival among patients without VTE, so if thrombosis is excluded, I should consider targeted cancer evaluation guided by clinical context [^111VCzqb] [^112mvG7L] [^115CSKwi].

> I should review infections and inflammation, as these frequently confound interpretation. Sepsis and inflammatory states elevate D-dimer via cytokine-driven coagulation activation; in COVID-19, elevated admission D-dimer predicts thrombotic and bleeding complications, critical illness, intubation, and mortality, and serial trajectories carry prognostic information; even acute infectious urticaria has been linked to transient D-dimer surges that normalize with clinical resolution [^1112FR7P] [^1167CMPR] [^11259pgZ] [^114cRg9s] [^114hinT9].

> Let me consider cardiovascular conditions beyond classic VTE. Heart failure, myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and stroke can raise D-dimer through neurohormonal and endothelial activation with secondary fibrinolysis, and while not specific, these elevations add prognostic and diagnostic nuance when integrated with clinical findings and other biomarkers [^113kRJDw] [^111VCzqb].

> I will now examine obstetric physiology and pathology so I don't misinterpret expected changes. D-dimer rises progressively during normal pregnancy and remains elevated early postpartum, so gestational-age–adjusted interpretation is needed; pathologies such as preeclampsia show exaggerated increases, and higher D-dimer has been associated with severe disease and postpartum hemorrhage risk in observational cohorts [^112cC2cs] [^115R3Cjp] [^113AgJ5q].

> But wait, what about physiologic and iatrogenic triggers. Aging steadily elevates baseline D-dimer, reducing specificity, making age-adjusted cutoffs helpful in many but not all settings; strenuous exercise transiently raises D-dimer; recent surgery and trauma, including pediatric TBI, commonly elevate levels, reflecting global hemostatic activation after tissue injury [^115cYYWv] [^1145BaEj] [^114z5LHZ].

> Next, I should review context adjustments for special populations so my advice is pragmatic. In older adults, use age-adjusted thresholds within validated pathways but recognize poor specificity in the very old; in pregnancy, combine clinical assessment with tailored algorithms and gestational reference frames; in cancer, treat a positive D-dimer as lower specificity for VTE but higher prognostic weight overall; in COVID-19, use D-dimer mainly as a prognostic biomarker to guide monitoring and thromboprophylaxis intensity rather than as a stand-alone diagnostic test [^115cYYWv] [^113AgJ5q] [^111VCzqb] [^1112FR7P].

> I should double-check the clinical algorithm to avoid missteps. Start with a validated pretest probability tool; if high probability for PE or DVT, skip D-dimer and proceed to imaging; if low-to-intermediate probability, obtain a high-sensitivity D-dimer and, if negative, safely exclude VTE without imaging; if positive, advance to compression ultrasonography for DVT or CT pulmonary angiography for PE, recognizing that decision pathways must align with the specific assay's validated cutoff and performance [^112rULpX] [^117TJSyF] [^115J9k13].

> Elevated D-dimer with negative VTE imaging should not be dismissed, but I need to be systematic. Consider occult malignancy guided by history and age-appropriate screening, look for infection or systemic inflammation, assess for heart failure or other cardiovascular disease, confirm pregnancy status or recent obstetric events, and revisit recent surgery or trauma; ED cohort data show links to infection, cancer, heart failure, anemia, and soft tissue disorders, with increased short-term mortality among those with elevated values [^111VCzqb] [^113F2rAD] [^115CSKwi].

> Hold on, I should verify assay and reporting issues so I don't misapply thresholds. D-dimer assays are heterogeneous in antibodies, calibrators, and units, reported either as FEU or D-Dimer Units with different manufacturer cutoffs, which are not interchangeable; point-of-care tests offer speed but vary in sensitivity, especially for small PE, and must be used within validated diagnostic strategies and local performance characteristics [^111orNuD] [^1167K4p2] [^111CUH5f].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I almost generalized age-adjusted cutoffs to everyone; that would be an overreach. Evidence supports age-adjustment to improve specificity without compromising safety in many older adults, but specificity can be so low in those over 80 that some guidelines advise avoiding D-dimer for exclusion in this group, necessitating tailored imaging decisions even when D-dimer is only modestly elevated [^115cYYWv] [^1145BaEj].

> Finally, I need to ensure the key messages are clear and clinically useful. D-dimer is primarily a rule-out test for VTE in low-to-intermediate probability patients; a positive result is non-specific and must be contextualized; avoid "D-dimeritis" by ordering only when it will change management; in high-risk contexts such as cancer, sepsis, and COVID-19, the magnitude and trajectory of D-dimer carry prognostic information and can guide monitoring intensity and follow-up evaluations [^112rULpX] [^111C8uTr] [^1167CMPR].

Elevated D-dimer reflects **increased fibrin formation and breakdown** [^113kRJDw] but is not specific for thrombosis [^notfound]. It is **highly sensitive but nonspecific** [^1167K4p2] [^115J9k13]; results should be interpreted in clinical context, and **age-adjusted cutoffs** can reduce false positives in older adults [^112rULpX] [^115cYYWv] [^114hsAB7]. The main causes include:

- **Thrombotic disorders**: VTE (DVT/PE) [^113kRJDw] [^115J9k13], DIC [^112DozZL], arterial thrombosis, and acute aortic dissection [^111hZa6Z] [^116oktvR].
- **Inflammation/infection**: Sepsis [^112DozZL], severe COVID-19 [^1112FR7P] [^11259pgZ], and chronic inflammatory states.
- **Malignancy**: Especially advanced or metastatic cancer [^111VCzqb] [^112mvG7L].
- **Physiological states**: Pregnancy [^113AgJ5q], postpartum [^112cC2cs], aging [^115cYYWv], and strenuous exercise [^1145BaEj] [^112DozZL].
- **Trauma/surgery**: Recent injury or operation [^113kRJDw] [^114Q7wUS].
- **Liver disease**: Cirrhosis and hepatic dysfunction [^112DozZL] [^notfound].

Disseminated intravascular coagulation

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a severe, often life-threatening syndrome characterized by diffuse and persistent activation of the hemostatic system, leading to intravascular thrombin generation and fibrin formation and degradation. Early recognition of DIC is crucial to allow prompt treatment, with the primary aim being to eliminate the underlying condition (e.g. sepsis, malignancy, trauma, obstetric diseases). D-dimer has become a cornerstone in the diagnosis of DIC due to its excellent negative predictive value, and its measurement in this context has been endorsed by both national and international guidelines. For instance, the International Society of Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) has validated a scoring system (including prothrombin time, platelet count, fibrinogen, and D-dimer levels) for its diagnostic and prognostic value. ISTH also recommends sequential D-dimer measurements to monitor the evolution of DIC and to guide clinical and therapeutic management.

- **Cancer, inflammation, and infection**: The activation of coagulation is a common finding in malignant tumors and is associated with their growth and progression. Consequently, up to 20% of cancer patients develop venous thromboembolism (VTE), which is the second leading cause of death in this population. D-dimer is over-produced in the presence of active malignancy, and levels are increased in a variety of tumors. However, the common presence of high D-dimer levels in cancer, even in the absence of thrombosis, limits the diagnostic usefulness of this test. Nevertheless, the incorporation of D-dimer measurement remains crucial.

### Elevated D-dimers are also a marker of underlying malignancy and increased mortality in the absence of venous thromboembolism [^111VCzqb]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2010). Low credibility.

D-dimers are used in conjunction with clinical probability scores in the assessment of venous thromboembolism (VTE), and they are elevated in other conditions, including malignancy, infection, and arrhythmias. High levels of D-dimers in VTE are associated with adverse outcomes, including increased mortality. Their significance in patients without VTE has not previously been established.

- **Aims**: To establish the clinical significance of elevated D-dimer levels in patients without VTE.

- **Methods**: This prospective study included 2263 patient episodes of suspected deep vein thrombosis, which were excluded radiologically. Patients were followed up for survival and adverse events for a median of 22 months.

- **Results**: D-dimer levels greater than 4000 ng FEU/ml (4.9% of patients), and greater than 8000 ng FEU/ml (1.8%) were associated with a reduced overall survival. D-dimer levels greater than 8000 ng FEU/ml and age over 60 years were independent poor prognostic factors for overall survival (p < 0.001). D-dimer levels greater than 8000 ng FEU/ml were associated with an increased incidence of malignancy (p = 0.003).

- **Conclusions**: This study provides evidence of very high D-dimer levels in patients with cancer who do not have VTE. This suggests that elevated D-dimer levels in patients with VTE and malignancy are not solely due to the presence of thrombus. High D-dimer levels in malignancy are likely to reflect the biology of the underlying tumor, with higher levels observed in breast, prostate, and bowel cancers.

### D-dimer is elevated in acute aortic dissection [^111hZa6Z]. BMJ Case Reports (2010). Low credibility.

This case illustrates that d-dimer is elevated in patients with acute aortic dissection. A 49-year-old woman presented with central, crushing chest pain exacerbated on inspiration. The chest pain was associated with right-leg numbness and pain, although peripheral pulses and blood pressures were normal. Routine blood tests demonstrated an elevated d-dimer with a normal ECG and chest X-ray radiograph. A differential diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and acute aortic dissection was made. A CT angiogram showed type B aortic dissection. This case report highlights the mounting evidence that d-dimer is elevated in practically all incidents of aortic dissection and could be useful as a negative predictive marker.

### A test in context: D-dimer [^113kRJDw]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2017). Low credibility.

D-dimer is a soluble fibrin degradation product that results from the ordered breakdown of thrombi by the fibrinolytic system. Numerous studies have shown that D-dimer serves as a valuable marker of activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis. Consequently, D-dimer has been extensively investigated for the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and is used routinely for this indication. In addition, D-dimer has been evaluated for determining the optimal duration of anticoagulation in VTE patients, for diagnosing and monitoring disseminated intravascular coagulation, and as an aid in the identification of medical patients at high risk for VTE. Thus, quantification of D-dimer levels serves an important role in guiding therapy.

### Covid-19 and coagulation: Bleeding and thrombotic manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection [^1112FR7P]. Blood (2020). Low credibility.

Patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have elevated D-dimer levels. Early reports describe high venous thromboembolism (VTE) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) rates, but data are limited. This multicenter retrospective study describes the rate and severity of hemostatic and thrombotic complications of 400 hospital-admitted COVID-19 patients (144 critically ill) primarily receiving standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation. Coagulation and inflammatory parameters were compared between patients with and without coagulation-associated complications. Multivariable logistic models examined the utility of these markers in predicting coagulation-associated complications, critical illness, and death.

The radiographically confirmed VTE rate was 4.8% (95% confidence interval, 2.9–7.3), and the overall thrombotic complication rate was 9.5% (95% CI, 6.8–12.8). The overall and major bleeding rates were 4.8% (95% CI, 2.9–7.3) and 2.3% (95% CI, 1.0–4.2), respectively.

In critically ill patients, radiographically confirmed VTE and major bleeding rates were 7.6% (95% CI, 3.9–13.3) and 5.6% (95% CI, 2.4–10.7), respectively. Elevated D-dimer at the initial presentation was predictive of coagulation-associated complications during hospitalization (D-dimer > 2500 ng/mL, adjusted odds ratio [OR] for thrombosis, 6.79 [95% CI, 2.39–19.30]; adjusted OR for bleeding, 3.56 [95% CI, 1.01–12.66]), critical illness, and death. Additional markers at initial presentation predictive of thrombosis during hospitalization included platelet count > 450 × 10⁹/L (adjusted OR, 3.56 [95% CI,…).

### D-dimer levels for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism: Making sense of international guideline recommendations [^112rULpX]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). High credibility.

Several international guidelines provide recommendations around the use of D-dimer testing for the exclusion of pulmonary embolism, including the appropriate D-dimer threshold (or cutoff), but there is no consensus among them. We briefly discuss guideline variation, performance characteristics, and limitations of commercially available D-dimer assays in this setting, referencing the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines that recommend immunoassays with high sensitivity (≥ 97%) and negative predictive value (≥ 98%).

While age-adjusted D-dimer and pretest-adjusted D-dimer are considered a safe strategy across predefined patient subgroups, clinicians need to recognize the different performance characteristics of D-dimer assays to enable safe clinical decisions for their patients. Importantly, D-dimer values must be correlated not only to clinical findings but also interpreted within the context of the accuracy and precision of the specific testing modality, adhering to manufacturer specifications that are approved by regulatory authorities.

### Is it possible to make a common reference standard for D-dimer measurements? Communication from the ISTH SSC Subcommittee on Fibrinolysis [^111orNuD]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

Further problems in routine D-dimer testing, reporting, and interpretation include the use of different units: D-dimer units or fibrinogen equivalent units (FEU), both expressed as mass/volume, which can be ng/ml, µg/ml, µg/L, etc. Different methods have different cut-off values or recommend that users define their own cut-off values, sometimes with adjustments for age. The diverse antibodies used in available methods react in different ways to the heterogeneous mixture of D-dimer antigens in samples found in various conditions where elevated D-dimer levels are of interest.

All these factors make it impossible to directly compare raw results from different methods. However, it might be possible to harmonize results between methods by using a common standard. A pooled plasma with elevated D-dimers from a large number of patients might be suitable as a common reference material. Alternatively, a mixture of fibrin degradation products (FDP) prepared from digested fibrin added to plasma may work, as it would be easier to produce reproducibly at scale and may be more comparable with calibrators prepared by manufacturers.

The work described below reports attempts to generate a potential international standard for D-dimer from pooled plasma or in vitro-generated cross-linked FDP, which might improve harmonization and reliability of results. However, a problem of instability of D-dimer antigen in plasma after freeze-drying was found, which further complicates the development of reliable reference materials and the harmonization of D-dimer measurements. These observations also suggest issues with the stability of D-dimer antigen in clinical samples.

### Elevated D-dimer levels predict recurrence in patients with idiopathic venous thromboembolism: a meta-analysis [^113YAbo3]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2009). Low credibility.

The evidence on the optimal duration of treatment in patients with an idiopathic venous thromboembolic event (VTE) is inconclusive. D-dimer testing to predict recurrent VTE (reVTE) has been evaluated in several studies.

- **Objectives**: We performed a meta-analysis of studies involving patients with idiopathic VTE treated with oral anticoagulation therapy (OAT) to assess the prognostic value of elevated D-dimer levels 1 month after discontinuation of OAT for VTE recurrence.

- **Patients/Methods**: The MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched to identify relevant studies. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they included patients with idiopathic VTE, reported results for this group separately, measured D-dimer approximately 1 month after discontinuation of OAT, and reported on the recurrence of VTE. A random-effects model was used to pool study results.

- **Results**: Data from four studies (1539 patients) were included in the analysis. All studies reported on the number of recurrent events in the normal and elevated D-dimer groups. Overall, 125 of 751 patients (16.6%) with elevated D-dimer levels experienced reVTE during the follow-up period compared with 57 of 788 patients (7.2%) with normal D-dimer levels. Elevated D-dimer levels were significantly associated with reVTE (odds ratio: 2.36; 95% CI, 1.65 to 3.36).

- **Conclusions**: Elevated D-dimer levels measured 1 month after discontinuation of OAT identify patients with idiopathic VTE at higher risk of recurrence.

### The term cotwin with spatial pulmonary lesions and elevated maternal-neonatal D-dimer levels following single intrauterine fetal death in a monochorionic-monoamniotic twin pregnancy: a case report and literature review [^112cC2cs]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Low credibility.

D-dimer, a fibrinolytic-specific degradation product, is a highly sensitive marker of fibrin formation. Elevated D-dimer concentrations indicate activation of both the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems. During normal pregnancy, D-dimer levels gradually increase, reaching a peak in the third trimester and remaining elevated for up to 48 hours postpartum. This elevation is due to the increased demand for fibrin formation and fibrinolysis, which helps maintain adequate blood flow to the placenta and fetus while reducing the risk of postpartum bleeding.

Previous studies have demonstrated that elevated maternal D-dimer levels are independent risk factors for postpartum hemorrhage. In the case of our patient, severe pelvic bleeding occurred two days postpartum. Although the possibility of this pelvic hematoma as a surgical complication following the cesarean section could not be entirely excluded, it is important to note that the two surgeons performing the procedure were senior obstetric directors, and the surgery itself proceeded without incident. As such, it was deemed relatively unlikely that the pelvic hematoma was a result of a surgical complication. Instead, the bleeding may be attributed to the delivery process, combined with increased fibrinolysis as indicated by elevated D-dimer levels. The consumption of fibrinogen leads to relatively low fibrinogen levels, which, in turn, increases the risk of postpartum hemorrhage.

The pathophysiology behind D-dimer elevation and its sustained effects on maternal and fetal outcomes, especially its association with maternal pelvic hemorrhage, is noteworthy.

### Role of fibrin D-dimer testing in emergency medicine [^114Q7wUS]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2003). Low credibility.

Systemic values of the fibrinolytic plasma marker fibrin D-dimer are elevated in a variety of acute clinical conditions. D-dimer values can now be rapidly determined and used to aid diagnosis in emergency medicine. However, despite clinical guidelines, the inappropriate and unnecessary measurement of D-dimer values remains a significant clinical problem. An understanding of the pathophysiological basis and limitations of D-dimer values may help reduce this issue. This review discusses the pathophysiology of the fibrinolytic system, the currently used assays, clinical indications, and limitations of D-dimer measurement. Finally, potential future clinical indications for the measurement of D-dimer values in emergency medicine are explored.

Literature on D-dimer was identified from Medline, with cross-referencing from the reference lists of major articles on the subject.

Systemic D-dimer values aid in diagnosis and are potentially prognostic indicators in a variety of clinical conditions in emergency medicine. However, they have limited specificity in patients with comorbid conditions. Although there is currently no standard D-dimer assay, immunoturbidimetric assays are the most suitable for use in emergency medicine.

### D-dimer and death in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019 [^11259pgZ]. Critical Care Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Hypercoagulability may be a key mechanism for acute organ injury and death in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019, but the relationship between elevated plasma levels of d-dimer, a biomarker of coagulation activation, and mortality has not been rigorously studied. We examined the independent association between d-dimer and death in critically ill patients with coronavirus disease 2019.

- **Design**: Multicenter cohort study.

- **Setting**: ICUs at 68 hospitals across the United States.

- **Patients**: Critically ill adults with coronavirus disease 2019 admitted to ICUs between March 4, 2020, and May 25, 2020, with a measured d-dimer concentration on ICU day 1 or 2.

- **Interventions**: None.

- **Measurements and main results**: The primary exposure was the highest normalized d-dimer level (assessed in four categories: < 2×, 2–3.9×, 4–7.9×, and ≥ 8× the upper limit of normal) on ICU day 1 or 2. The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality. Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for confounders. Among 3,418 patients (63.1% male; median age 62 years [interquartile range, 52–71 years]), 3,352 (93.6%) had a d-dimer concentration above the upper limit of normal. A total of 1,180 patients (34.5%) died within 28 days. Patients in the highest compared with lowest d-dimer category had a 3.11-fold higher odds of death (95% CI, 2.56–3.77) in univariate analyses, decreasing to a 1.81-fold increased odds of death (95% CI, 1.43–2.28) after multivariable adjustment for demographics, comorbidities, and illness severity. Further adjustment for therapeutic anticoagulation did not meaningfully alter the results.

### European Stroke Organization guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of cerebral venous thrombosis - endorsed by the European Academy of Neurology [^111vvojr]. European Journal of Neurology (2017). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for cerebral venous thrombosis, and more specifically with respect to D-dimer testing, the ESO 2017 guidelines recommend considering the obtainment of a D-dimer test before neuroimaging in patients with suspected CVT. This does not apply to patients with isolated headache or those experiencing symptoms for a prolonged duration, defined as more than one week before the test.

### Excluding venous thromboembolism using point of care D-dimer tests in outpatients: a diagnostic meta-analysis [^1119hm4S]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

Diagnosing patients suspected of venous thromboembolism — that is, deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) — is a major challenge because the signs and symptoms are often mild and non-specific. Primary care physicians, in particular, face the initial presentation of venous thromboembolism and must decide whether to refer patients for subsequent testing. This can complicate the diagnostic process.

D-dimer testing can enhance the cost-effectiveness of the diagnostic process. D-dimers are degradation products of cross-linked fibrin generated during fibrinolysis, and circulating levels are typically elevated in patients with venous thromboembolism. A negative result in a D-dimer test, when combined with a low pre-test probability of venous thromboembolism (as assessed by a validated clinical decision rule), can safely rule out DVT as well as PE. A large variety of laboratory D-dimer tests are available, and their accuracy has been described extensively.

Recently, various point-of-care or "near patient" D-dimer tests have been introduced. These tests can be performed during the patient's consultation, with results available within 10–15 minutes. The use of these tests could avoid the need for more labor-intensive and time-consuming laboratory D-dimer testing. This advantage is especially beneficial for primary care physicians, as they often must decide on patient management during the consultation of a patient with suspected venous thromboembolism.

### How we manage a high D-dimer [^115CSKwi]. Haematologica (2024). Low credibility.

D-dimer, a soluble fibrin degradation product that originates from plasmin-induced degradation of cross-linked fibrin, is an important biomarker of coagulation activation and secondary fibrinolysis. It is routinely used to rule out venous thromboembolism (VTE), evaluate the risk of VTE recurrence, and determine the optimal duration of anticoagulant therapy. Besides VTE, D-dimer levels may be elevated due to physiological conditions, including aging, pregnancy, and strenuous physical activity. Additionally, several disorders have been associated with increased D-dimer levels, ranging from disseminated intravascular coagulation to infectious diseases and cancers. Thus, it is not unusual for hematologists to encounter ambulatory individuals with elevated D-dimer levels without signs or symptoms of thrombus formation. This narrative review is dedicated to the management of these cases by hematologists.

### D-dimer as a potential biomarker for disease severity in COVID-19 [^113eQED6]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

This study seeks to determine the utility of D-dimer levels as a biomarker in determining disease severity and prognosis in COVID-19.

- **Methods**: Clinical, imaging, and laboratory data of 120 patients, whose COVID-19 diagnosis was based on RT-PCR, were evaluated retrospectively. The severity of COVID-19 was classified clinically as noncomplicated, mild, or severe pneumonia. Radiologically, the area of affected lungs compatible with viral pneumonia in each patient's computed tomography was classified as either 0–30% or ≥ 31% of the total lung area. The D-dimer values and laboratory data of patients with COVID-19 were compared with inpatient status, duration of hospitalization, and lung involvement during treatment and follow-up. To assess the predictive value of D-dimer, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was conducted.

- **Results**: D-dimer elevation (> 243 ng/ml) was detected in 63.3% (76/120) of the patients. The mean D-dimer value was calculated as 3144.50 ± 1709.4 ng/ml (1643–8548) for inpatients with severe pneumonia in the intensive care unit. D-dimer values showed positive correlations with age, duration of stay, lung involvement, fibrinogen, neutrophil count, neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR). When the threshold D-dimer value was 370 ng/ml in the ROC analysis, this value was calculated to have 77% specificity and 74% sensitivity for lung involvement in patients with COVID-19.

- **Conclusion**: D-dimer levels in patients with COVID-19 correlate with outcomes, but further studies are needed to determine their usefulness definitively.

### Investigation of age-adjusted D-dimer using an uncommon assay [^114hsAB7]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). High credibility.

Use of an age-adjusted D-dimer for evaluating acute pulmonary embolus (PE) has been prospectively validated in the literature and is now recommended by major medical societies. Most research on this topic involves the most common D-dimer assays, which report in Fibrinogen Equivalent Units (FEU) with a non-age-adjusted manufacturer-recommended cutoff of 500 ng/ml FEU. Limited research has evaluated age-adjustment in assays reporting in D-Dimer Units (D-DU), which use a manufacturer-recommended cutoff of 230 ng/ml D-DU. Despite limited evidence, an age-adjusted formula using D-DU has been recently endorsed by the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP). This formula seems arbitrary in its derivation, deviating unnecessarily from existing thresholds, prompting the creation of our novel age-adjustment formula. The study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the test characteristics of our novel age-adjusted D-dimer formula using the D-DU assay compared to existing traditional and age-adjusted D-dimer thresholds for evaluating acute PE in the ED.

- **Methods**: This was a retrospective chart review conducted at an academic quaternary health system with three EDs and 195,000 combined annual ED visits. Only patients with D-dimer testing and CT PE protocol (CTPE) imaging were included. Admission and discharge diagnosis codes were used to identify acute PE. Outcome measures included sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) of an unadjusted traditional threshold (230).

### D-dimer to rule out venous thromboembolism during pregnancy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^113AgJ5q]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

- **Target conditions**: The target conditions were acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) and/or deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Suspected PE is usually defined as an acute onset of new or worsening shortness of breath or chest pain, with or without hemoptysis, tachycardia, increased respiratory rate, low blood pressure, or fainting, without an obvious explanation. Suspected DVT is characterized by unilateral lower limb pain and/or edema without an obvious explanation.

- **Reference standards**: The reference standard was a final confirmation or exclusion of the diagnosis by validated imaging tests (positive reference standards) used within VTE diagnostic algorithms. These included lower limb venous compression ultrasound (CUS), ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) lung scan, computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA), and pulmonary angiography for PE; and lower limb venous CUS for DVT. Additionally, the rate of VTE events during the 3-month clinical follow-up served as a negative reference standard.

- **Data sources and searches**: Studies utilizing VTE diagnostic algorithms, including D-dimer to rule out the diagnosis of PE and/or DVT in pregnant women, were systematically searched using the MEDLINE (1966 to June 2021, week 1) and EMBASE (1980 to June 2021, week 1) electronic databases. The search strategy was developed without any language restrictions using the terms: "venous thromboembolism" OR "lung embolism" OR "deep vein thrombosis" AND "pregnancy" OR "puerperium" AND "D-dimer". To supplement our search, we manually reviewed the reference lists of all retrieved articles, clinicalTrials.gov, and reference literature (guidelines and systematic reviews) and consulted experts in VTE diagnostic strategies for any possible missing studies.

### Is it possible to make a common reference standard for D-dimer measurements? Communication from the ISTH SSC Subcommittee on Fibrinolysis [^116XXbo3]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2022). Low credibility.

Elevated plasma D-dimer is a marker for ongoing coagulation and fibrinolysis. The antigen target in D-dimer tests is actually a heterogeneous mixture of fibrin degradation products (FDP) of varying size, which are generated by plasmin following activation of the fibrinolytic system. These fibrin fragments contain cross-linked D domains, formed by activated factor XIII (FXIIIa), a transglutaminase produced by the action of thrombin on the zymogen precursor FXIII.

Early work on the identification and use of fibrin breakdown products as a diagnostic marker was boosted by the introduction of monoclonal antibody technology and subsequently led to the development of a large diagnostic testing industry. However, common D-dimer tests are characterized by high sensitivity but low specificity, which means the results have good negative predictive value (NPV) but poor positive predictive value (PPV), resulting in a high rate of false positives.

Therefore, D-dimer testing in clinical practice is widely used to exclude thrombosis, but confirmatory testing is required if patient values exceed a predefined cut-off. NPV can be improved by various algorithms such as the Wells' score, which aims to reduce the likelihood of positive results in the population tested. Elevated D-dimer levels are seen in a number of other pathological states, such as disseminated intravascular coagulation, cardiovascular disease, cancer, inflammatory disease, trauma, and infections, including SARS-CoV-2, and are used to monitor therapy in patients with previous thrombosis.

### Admission D-dimer levels, D-dimer trends, and outcomes in COVID-19 [^1167CMPR]. Thrombosis Research (2020). Low credibility.

Observational data suggest that an acquired prothrombotic state may contribute to the pathophysiology of COVID-19. These data include elevated D-dimers observed among many COVID-19 patients. We present a retrospective analysis of admission D-dimer and D-dimer trends among 1,065 adult hospitalized COVID-19 patients across six New York hospitals. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and secondary outcomes included intubation and venous thromboembolism (VTE).

Three hundred thirteen patients (29.4%) died, 319 (30.0%) required intubation, and 30 (2.8%) had diagnosed VTE. Using Cox proportional-hazard modeling, each 1 μg/ml increase in admission D-dimer level was associated with a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.06 (95% CI 1.04–1.08, p < 0.0001) for death, 1.08 (95% CI 1.06–1.10, p < 0.0001) for intubation, and 1.08 (95% CI 1.03–1.13, p = 0.0087) for VTE.

- **Time-dependent receiver-operator curves**: For admission D-dimer as a predictor of death, intubation, and VTE yielded areas-under-the-curve of 0.694, 0.621, and 0.565 respectively.

- **Joint latent class modeling**: Identified distinct groups of patients with respect to D-dimer trend. Patients with stable D-dimer trajectories had HRs of 0.29 (95% CI 0.17–0.49, p < 0.0001) and 0.22 (95% CI 0.10–0.45, p = 0.0001) relative to those with increasing D-dimer trajectories, for the outcomes death and intubation respectively. Patients with low-increasing D-dimer trajectories had a multivariable HR for VTE of 0.18 (95% CI 0.05–0.68, p = 0.0117) relative to those with high-decreasing D-dimer trajectories.

### Serum D-dimer concentrations are increased after pediatric traumatic brain injury [^114z5LHZ]. Journal of Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

To determine whether D-dimer would be increased in children with traumatic brain injury (TBI), specifically mild abusive head trauma, D-dimer was measured using multiplex bead technology in 195 children under 4 years old (n = 93 controls without TBI, n = 102 cases with TBI) using previously collected serum. D-dimer was then measured prospectively in a clinical setting in 44 children (n = 24 controls, n = 20 cases). Receiver operator curves were generated for prospective data.

In both the retrospective and prospective cohorts, median (25th-75th percentile) D-dimer was significantly higher in cases compared to controls. A receiver operator curve demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.91 (95% CI 0.83–0.99) in the prospective cohort. At a cut-off of 0.59 μg/L, the sensitivity and specificity for identifying a case was 90% and 75%, respectively.

Our data suggest that serum D-dimer may be used to identify which young children at risk for abusive head trauma might benefit from a head computed tomography or other additional evaluations. Additional data are needed to better identify the clinical scenarios that may result in false positive or false negative D-dimer concentrations.

### Pulmonary embolism despite negative ELISA D-dimer: a case report [^117RPkqc]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolus (PE) can be fatal, but it is often treatable if recognized early. Unfortunately, the clinical presentation of PE is frequently variable and misleading. Recently, the D-dimer assay has gained favor as a method to exclude PE; however, this test has an acceptable safety margin only in low-risk populations. The exact composition of this low-risk population remains unclear.

This report discusses the case of a 26-year-old woman with over two weeks of chest pain and intermittent dyspnea. Initially seen in the Emergency Department (ED) and hospitalized, she returned to the ED two weeks later with similar symptoms. Although the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) D-dimer assays were normal during both the initial and subsequent ED visits, a pulmonary embolism (PE) was diagnosed by computed tomography scan on the second visit.

This report underscores the risk of misdiagnosing PE if relying solely on ELISA D-dimer for exclusion. The approach to detecting PE should include an assessment of clinical probability. Additionally, this report highlights the presentation of PE despite having two unremarkable ELISA D-dimer measurements and emphasizes the importance of maintaining clinical suspicion.

### D-dimer testing to determine the duration of anticoagulation therapy [^116Mqtnj]. The New England Journal of Medicine (2006). High credibility.

The study PROLONG, published by Palareti G and colleagues in 2006 in the journal *The New England Journal of Medicine*, focuses on pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. The trial aimed to determine the role of D-dimer testing in deciding the duration of anticoagulation therapy for patients who experienced a first idiopathic episode of venous thromboembolism (VTE).

- **Study design and population**: This multi-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial (RCT) included 223 patients (118 females, 105 males). Participants had a first unprovoked proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) and had received vitamin K antagonist (VKA) therapy for at least 3 months, followed by D-dimer testing. Key exclusion criteria involved serious liver disease, renal insufficiency, and conditions affecting anticoagulation or with limited life expectancy.

- **Interventions**: Among the participants, 120 patients with abnormal D-dimer levels discontinued anticoagulation (discontinuation of VKA therapy), whereas 103 patients with abnormal D-dimer levels resumed anticoagulation (resumption of VKA therapy).

- **Primary outcome**: The study reported a significant increase in the recurrence of thromboembolism in the discontinuation group compared to the resumption group (15% vs. 2.9%; adjusted hazard ratio 4.26, 95% confidence interval 1.23 to 14.6).

- **Safety outcomes**: No significant differences in mortality were observed between the groups.

The study concluded that for patients with a first unprovoked proximal DVT or PE who had received VKA therapy for at least 3 months and underwent D-dimer testing, those with abnormal D-dimer levels who discontinued anticoagulation were at a higher risk for recurrence compared to those who resumed therapy.

### Prevalence and outcomes of D-dimer elevation in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [^114cRg9s]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2020). Low credibility.

To determine the prevalence of D-dimer elevation in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalization, trajectory of D-dimer levels during hospitalization, and its association with clinical outcomes, a study was conducted. Consecutive adults admitted to a large New York City hospital system with a positive polymerase chain reaction test for SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) between March 1, 2020, and April 8, 2020, were identified. Elevated D-dimer was defined by the laboratory-specific upper limit of normal (> 230 ng/mL).

- **Outcomes**: Included critical illness (intensive care, mechanical ventilation, discharge to hospice, or death), thrombotic events, acute kidney injury, and death during admission. Among 2377 adults hospitalized with COVID-19 and ≥ 1 D-dimer measurement, 1823 (76%) had an elevated D-dimer at presentation. Patients with elevated presenting baseline D-dimer were more likely than those with normal D-dimer to experience critical illness (43.9% versus 18.5%; adjusted odds ratio, 2.4 [95% CI, 1.9–3.1]; P < 0.001). Moreover, D-dimer levels > 2000 ng/mL were associated with the highest risk of critical illness (66%), thrombotic event (37.8%), acute kidney injury (58.3%), and death (47%).

### Diagnostic accuracy of conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values in older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^115cYYWv]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

D-dimer concentrations are highly sensitive for thrombus formation. Hence, D-dimer tests are often used to rule out venous thromboembolism, such as pulmonary embolism or deep vein thrombosis, in suspected patients with a non-high clinical probability. Patients with a high clinical probability do not require a D-dimer test. In these cases, imaging examinations are warranted to confirm or refute the diagnosis, irrespective of the D-dimer results. However, D-dimer concentrations increase with age, which leads to a high proportion of older patients with D-dimer concentrations higher than conventional cut-off values (500 µg/L). This, in turn, results in low specificity (i.e. more false-positive results) of D-dimer testing in older patients suspected of having venous thromboembolism. The specificity is 49% to 67% for patients aged less than 50 years but ranges between 0% and 18% in patients aged 80 years or older.

As imaging is indicated in patients suspected of having venous thromboembolism with a D-dimer concentration above the cut-off value, a high proportion of older patients with a non-high clinical probability undergo unnecessary diagnostic investigations. This can be burdensome, especially for older patients, and the yield of this imaging is relatively low; typically, 20% or fewer of patients with clinically suspected venous thromboembolism are actually affected. As a result of the low specificity of D-dimer testing in older patients, some authors advise against D-dimer testing in very old patients. Nonetheless, this approach would imply referring all suspected older patients for further investigation, regardless of the initial D-dimer test results.

### Plasma D-dimer may predict poor functional outcomes through systemic complications after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage [^116d7n4g]. Journal of Neurosurgery (2017). Low credibility.

Plasma D-dimer levels elevate during acute stages of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and are associated with poor functional outcomes. However, the mechanism by which D-dimer elevation on admission affects functional outcomes remains unknown. The aim of this study is to clarify whether D-dimer levels on admission are correlated with systemic complications after aneurysmal SAH, and to investigate their additive predictive value on conventional risk factors for poor functional outcomes.

A total of 187 patients with aneurysmal SAH were retrospectively analyzed from a single-center, observational cohort database. Correlations of plasma D-dimer levels on admission with patient characteristics, initial presentation, neurological complications, and systemic complications were identified. The authors also evaluated the additive value of D-dimer elevation on admission for poor functional outcomes by comparing predictive models with and without D-dimer.

D-dimer elevation on admission was associated with increasing age, female sex, and severity of SAH. Patients with higher D-dimer levels had increased likelihood of nosocomial infections (OR 1.22 [95% CI 1.07–1.39], p = 0.004), serum sodium disorders (OR 1.11 [95% CI 1.01–1.23], p = 0.033), and cardiopulmonary complications (OR 1.20 [95% CI 1.04–1.37], p = 0.01) on multivariable analysis. D-dimer elevation was an independent risk factor of poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale Score 3–6, OR 1.50 [95% CI 1.15–1.95], p = 0.003). A novel prediction model with D-dimer had significantly better discrimination than models without D-dimer.

### Negative D-dimer result to exclude recurrent deep venous thrombosis: a management trial [^112vF8P4]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2004). Low credibility.

All of the available diagnostic tests for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) have limitations for excluding acute recurrent DVT (reDVT). Measurement of plasma D-dimer using an automated quantitative assay may be useful as a rapid exclusion test in patients with suspected reDVT.

- **Objective**: To test the safety of withholding additional diagnostic testing and heparin treatment in patients who have a negative D-dimer result at presentation (using the automated quantitative assay STA-Liatest D-di), regardless of their symptoms.

- **Design**: Prospective cohort study.

- **Setting**: Academic medical center in the United States.

- **Patients**: 300 consecutive patients with suspected reDVT.

- **Intervention**: Patients underwent D-dimer testing at presentation. In patients with negative D-dimer results, heparin therapy was withheld, and no further diagnostic testing for DVT was done as part of the initial evaluation. Patients with positive D-dimer results underwent compression ultrasonography.

- **Measurements**: The primary outcome measure was a diagnosis of new symptomatic venous thromboembolism confirmed by diagnostic testing during the 3-month follow-up period.

- **Results**: Of the 300 study patients, the D-dimer result was negative at presentation in 134 patients (45%; negative cohort) and positive at presentation in 166 patients. Of the 166 patients, compression ultrasonography documented new DVT in 54 patients. Compression ultrasonography findings were normal in 79 patients and were inconclusive in 33 patients. After 3 months of follow-up, 1 of 134 patients in the negative cohort had a confirmed diagnosis of new symptomatic venous thromboembolism.

### Widely used types and clinical applications of D-dimer assay [^111CUH5f]. Laboratory Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

D-dimers are formed by the breakdown of fibrinogen and fibrin during fibrinolysis. D-dimer analysis is critical for the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Modern assays for D-dimer are monoclonal antibody based. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is the reference method for D-dimer analysis in the central clinical laboratory, but it is time-consuming to perform. Recently, a number of rapid, point-of-care D-dimer assays have been developed for acute care settings that utilize a variety of methodologies.

In view of the diversity of D-dimer assays used in central laboratory and point-of-care settings, several caveats must be taken to assure the proper interpretation and clinical application of the results. These include consideration of preanalytical variables and interfering substances, as well as patient drug therapy and underlying disease. D-dimer assays should also be validated in clinical studies, have established cut-off values, and be reported according to the reagent manufacturers' recommendations.

### Clinical pre-test probability adjusted versus age-adjusted D-dimer interpretation strategy for DVT diagnosis: A diagnostic individual patient data meta-analysis [^117YBSbL]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2020). Low credibility.

To increase the clinical usefulness of the D-dimer test in the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), two strategies have been proposed: the age-adjusted interpretation and the clinical pre-test probability (CPTP) adjusted interpretation. However, it is not known which of these strategies is superior.

- **Objective**: To conduct an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis that compares the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and utility (the proportion of all patients who have a negative D-dimer test) when the two strategies are used to interpret D-dimer results.

- **Methods**: Using an established IPD database, we conducted a meta-analysis to compare the two strategies. A bivariate random effects regression model was used to estimate and compare the pooled sensitivity and specificity simultaneously. The pooled NPV and utility of the two strategies were compared using a univariate random effects model.

- **Results**: Four studies were eligible for this analysis, with a total of 2554 patients. The overall prevalence of DVT was 12% with substantial heterogeneity between studies (P value < .001). Both strategies have high pooled NPVs (99.8%) with a difference of 0% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.1, 0.1). The difference between the pooled specificity of the CPTP-adjusted strategy (57.3%) and the age-adjusted strategy (54.7%) was 2.6% (95% CI: -7.7, 12.8). The CPTP-adjusted strategy (49.4%) has a marginally greater pooled utility compared with the age-adjusted approach (47.4%), with a pooled difference of 1.9% (95% CI: -0.1, 3.9).

### Excluding venous thromboembolism using point of care D-dimer tests in outpatients: a diagnostic meta-analysis [^1167K4p2]. BMJ (2009). High credibility.

Most of the studies in our review included patients suspected of DVT. Only six studies evaluated patients suspected of PE. In patients with PE, there is a strong correlation between embolus location and D-dimer levels. Small sub-segmental thrombi result in less D-dimer formation, so D-dimer tests have lower sensitivity in patients suspected of PE. Indeed, two of the three Clearview Simplify D-dimer studies that included patients suspected of PE had lower sensitivity than the studies that only included patients suspected of DVT. No studies on the diagnostic accuracy of the Cardiac D-dimer for patients suspected of PE were available; therefore, our results for patients suspected of PE should be interpreted with more caution than those relating to patients with DVT.

Different studies used various reference standards to diagnose or exclude venous thromboembolism. As with many reference standards, none was a 24-carat gold standard. For example, compression ultrasonography is used as the reference standard in most DVT studies. A meta-analysis by Goodacre et al. found a pooled sensitivity of compression ultrasonography for detection of proximal DVT of 0.94, compared with venography as the reference standard. This finding implies that even compression ultrasonography might miss a small proportion of DVT cases. Given that most of the DVT studies in our analysis used compression ultrasonography as the reference standard, the reported pooled sensitivity of the point of care D-dimer tests could thus be slightly overestimated.

### How we manage a high D-dimer [^115KTUBp]. Haematologica (2024). Low credibility.

D-dimer, a soluble fibrin degradation product originating from plasmin-induced degradation of cross-linked fibrin, is an important biomarker of coagulation activation and secondary fibrinolysis. It is routinely used to rule out venous thromboembolism (VTE), evaluate the risk of VTE recurrence, and determine the optimal duration of anticoagulant therapy. Aside from VTE, D-dimer levels may be elevated due to physiological conditions such as aging, pregnancy, and strenuous physical activity. Additionally, several disorders are associated with increased D-dimer levels, ranging from disseminated intravascular coagulation to infectious diseases and cancers. Consequently, it is not uncommon for hematologists to encounter ambulatory individuals with elevated D-dimer levels without signs or symptoms of thrombus formation. This narrative review focuses on the management of these cases by the hematologist.

### The diagnoses and outcomes of emergency patients with an elevated D-dimer over the next 90 days [^113F2rAD]. The American Journal of Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

It is not known what diagnoses are associated with an elevated D-dimer in unselected patients attending emergency departments (ED), nor have their associated outcomes been determined.

- **Methods**: This was a prospective observational study of 1,612 unselected patients attending a Danish ED, with 100% follow-up for 90 days after presentation.

- **Results**: The 765 (47%) ED patients with an elevated D-dimer level (i.e. ≥ 0.5 mg/L) were more likely to be admitted to the hospital (P < 0.0001), re-present to health services (P = 0.02), and die within 90 days (8.1% of patients, P < 0.0001). Only 10 patients with a normal D-dimer level (1.2%) died within 90 days. Five had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and infection, and 5 had cancer (4 of whom also had infection). Venous thromboembolism, infection, neoplasia, anemia, heart failure, and unspecified soft tissue disorders were significantly associated with an elevated D-dimer level. Of the 72 patients with venous thromboembolism, 20 also had infection, 8 had cancer, and 4 had anemia. None of the patients with heart failure, stroke, or acute myocardial infarction with a normal D-dimer level died within 90 days.

- **Conclusions**: In this study, nearly half of all patients attending the ED had an elevated D-dimer level. These patients were more likely to be admitted to the hospital and to re-present to health services or die within 90 days. In this unselected ED patient population, elevated D-dimer levels were found to not only be significantly associated with venous thromboembolism but also with infection, cancer, heart failure, and other conditions.

### The D-dimer assay [^113CguKd]. American Journal of Hematology (2019). Low credibility.

The D-dimer is an indirect marker of fibrinolysis and fibrin turnover; this molecule exhibits unique properties as a biological marker of hemostatic abnormalities and an indicator of intravascular thrombosis. D-dimer is a soluble fibrin degradation product that results from the systematic degradation of vascular thrombi through the fibrinolytic mechanism. Because of this, the D-dimer serves as a valuable marker of activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis in several clinical scenarios. Most commonly, D-dimer has been extensively investigated for excluding the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and is used routinely for this indication. Additionally, D-dimer has been evaluated for determining the optimal duration of anticoagulation in VTE patients, diagnosing and monitoring disseminated intravascular coagulation, and monitoring other conditions in which the patient is at high risk of bleeding or thrombosis. Limitations of the assay include D-dimer elevation in a constellation of clinical scenarios, such as age, pregnancy, and cancer, and lack of clinical standardization.

### Response to the comment: "Advocating prudent D-dimer testing: Constructive perspectives and comments on 'How we manage a high D-dimer'" [^111C8uTr]. Haematologica (2024). High credibility.

We would like to thank Gonzaga and de Alencas for their letter. Their comments on our review article, "How we manage a high D-dimer", recently published in Haematologica, are reasonable and well substantiated. The main objective of our review was to simplify the particularly complex topic of increased D-dimer levels to provide a handy tool for the daily clinical practice of hematologists. The authors made two comments on our narrative review.

- **First comment**: We agree with Gonzaga and de Alencas's first comment that D-dimer may carry a high positive predictive value in selected pathological conditions characterized by a very high pre-test probability. However, in our review, we referred (always for reasons of practicality) to the main clinical setting for which the D-dimer is used, which is pulmonary embolism exclusion. In this setting, to ensure optimal patient management, an ideal D-dimer test should have very high sensitivity and a very high negative predictive value.

- **Second comment**: Regarding the second comment on the inappropriateness and overuse of the D-dimer test in most cases, we also agree with the authors. Unfortunately, the D-dimer test has become very common practice, at least in Italy, and its use has exponentially increased over the last few years (hence the nickname "D-dimeritis"), particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is clear, however, that an elevated D-dimer in an individual referred by the general practitioner to the hematologist cannot be ignored. All the diagnostic procedures listed in Figure 3 of our review have to be implemented to rule out or diagnose the possible conditions.

### D-dimer test for excluding the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^117TJSyF]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2016). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) can occur when a thrombus (blood clot) travels through the veins and lodges in the arteries of the lungs, producing an obstruction. People who are thought to be at risk include those with cancer, individuals who have had a recent surgical procedure, have experienced long periods of immobilization, and women who are pregnant. The clinical presentation can vary, but unexplained respiratory symptoms such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, and an increased respiratory rate are common. D-dimers are fragments of protein released into the circulation when a blood clot breaks down due to normal body processes or with the use of prescribed fibrinolytic medication. The D-dimer test is a laboratory assay currently used to rule out the presence of high D-dimer plasma levels and, by association, venous thromboembolism (VTE). D-dimer tests are rapid, simple, and inexpensive, and can prevent the high costs associated with expensive diagnostic tests.

- **Objectives**: To investigate the ability of the D-dimer test to rule out a diagnosis of acute PE in patients treated in hospital outpatient and accident and emergency (A&E) settings who have had a pre-test probability (PTP) of PE determined according to a clinical prediction rule (CPR), by estimating the accuracy of the test according to estimates of sensitivity and specificity. The review focuses on those patients who are not already established on anticoagulation at the time of study recruitment.

- **Search methods**: We searched 13 databases from conception until December 2013. We cross-checked the reference list.

### How we manage a high D-dimer [^114SZGPx]. Haematologica (2024). Low credibility.

Hemostasis can be schematically represented as a constant, delicate equilibrium between anticoagulant and procoagulant strengths to maintain the blood in physiological conditions of fluidity. The primary function of hemostasis is the generation of a stable clot in the event of vascular injury, thereby preventing excessive blood loss. While the formation of a clot, composed essentially of fibrin and blood cells (i.e. erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets), is essential to stop bleeding, its timely removal by the fibrinolytic system is also needed to restore blood flow within the repaired blood vessel. Clot lysis, mediated by plasmin and other proteases, is accompanied by the generation of fibrin degradation products. Among the laboratory biomarkers of fibrinolysis, D-dimer is currently considered the gold standard due to its high sensitivity, rapid results, widespread availability, and relatively low cost of the assays. Besides thromboembolic diseases, several physiological and pathological conditions (i.e. aging, pregnancy, cancer, inflammation, infection) not necessarily characterized by thrombus formation have been associated with increased D-dimer.

In this narrative review aimed at the hematologist, we first present a typical clinical case and describe the physiology and physiopathology of D-dimer formation. This is followed by a summary of the main conditions associated with increased D-dimer, and we propose an approach to their management based on evidence in the literature and personal experiences.

### How we manage a high D-dimer [^115GGbL5]. Haematologica (2024). Low credibility.

For this narrative review, we examined the medical literature for complete published studies on the management of patients with increased D-dimer. A literature search of the PubMed (through Medline) electronic database was carried out without time limits. Only studies published in English were considered. The Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) and keywords used were:

- **Conditions**: thrombosis, venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, cancer, inflammation, disseminated intravascular coagulation, trauma, infection, sepsis, pregnancy, cardiovascular disease, acute aortic dissection, coronary artery disease
- **Interventions**: management, treatment
- **Procedures**: surgery, joint arthroplasty

We also screened the reference lists of the most relevant articles for further studies not captured in the initial literature search.

### Elevated D-dimers in attacks of hereditary angioedema are not associated with increased thrombotic risk [^1174EVd7]. Allergy (2015). Low credibility.

As recombinant C1INH (Ruconest®, rhC1INH) is the newest on the market, its potential thrombogenic risk was recently investigated by Relan et al. This study demonstrated that although coagulation and fibrinolysis pathways were indeed activated during acute attacks, treatment with rhC1INH had little or no effect on other coagulation markers, suggesting that it does not exert prothrombotic activity in vivo.

The present study focused on plasma D-dimers because these are considered a reliable and sensitive index of thrombosis in vivo and indicative of a dynamic process of thrombus formation and lysis. In clinical practice, D-dimers are elevated in various thrombotic conditions, including venous thromboembolism, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and cerebrovascular accidents. However, D-dimers have also been shown to be elevated in conditions without clinical evidence for thrombosis.

### D-dimer testing: The role of the clinical laboratory in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^115n9rxw]. Journal of Clinical Pathology (2001). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is a common, yet often unsuspected and unrecognized disease associated with high mortality. New, objective, user-friendly, and cost-effective diagnostic strategies are being explored. D-dimers, the fibrinolytic degradation products of crosslinked fibrin, have emerged as the most useful markers of procoagulant activity and ongoing fibrinolysis. D-dimer measurements are very sensitive in excluding a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism when normal values are present, there is a low clinical suspicion, and lung scans are non-diagnostic. Several assays have been developed and are reviewed.

### D-dimer to rule out venous thromboembolism during pregnancy: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115or3pN]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2021). Low credibility.

- **Methods**: This systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and the Preferred Reporting Items for a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Diagnostic Test Accuracy Studies (PRISMA-DTA) guidelines.

- **Criteria for study selection**: Prospective and retrospective studies that used plasma D-dimer measurement to rule out VTE in pregnant women with suspected PE and/or DVT were considered. We included studies using D-dimer (index test), combined or not with PTP assessment, in which an imaging test (V/Q lung scan, CTPA, pulmonary angiography, lower limb venous CUS) or clinical follow-up at 3 months was used as the reference standard. Studies were eligible if a 2 × 2 contingency table was supplied or could be back-calculated (true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives), or if the sensitivity and NPV of D-dimer could be calculated.

- **Population**: The study's population consisted of adult (≥ 18 years) pregnant women during their first, second, or third trimester of pregnancy presenting to an outpatient clinic or emergency department with symptoms and/or signs suggestive of acute PE and/or DVT, namely acute or new-onset dyspnea and/or chest pain or lower limb pain and/or edema without an obvious explanation. The present analysis targets a population of pregnant women estimated with a disease prevalence consistent with a low/intermediate or unlikely PTP according to a CDR (prespecified PTP) or irrespective of PTP when a CDR had not been applied (PTP not used) in the original study.

### Utility of an initial D-dimer assay in screening for traumatic or spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage [^117W1iLK]. Academic Emergency Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

To evaluate the sensitivity of a D-dimer assay as a screening tool for possible traumatic or spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage, a prospective, consecutive, blinded study was conducted. If adequately sensitive, the D-dimer assay may potentially permit omission of a more expensive computed tomography (CT) scan of the head when such hemorrhage is clinically suspected.

- **Methods**: The study involved patients over 16 years of age who required a CT scan of the head for suspected intracranial hemorrhage over a five-month period at a university Level I trauma center. All study patients had a serum D-dimer assay obtained prior to their CT scans. Sensitivity and specificity, with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) D-dimer assay for the detection of intracranial hemorrhage were calculated.

- **Results**: Of the 319 patients entered in the study, 25 (7.8%) had a CT scan positive for intracranial hemorrhage. Patients with intracranial hemorrhage were more likely to have a positive D-dimer assay (chi-square = 13.075, p < 0.001). The D-dimer assay had 21 true-positive and four false-negative tests, resulting in a sensitivity of 84.0% (95% CI = 63.7% to 95.5%) and a specificity of 55.8% (95% CI = 55.5% to 55.9%). The four false-negative cases included one small intraparenchymal hemorrhage, one small subarachnoid hemorrhage, one moderate-sized intraparenchymal hemorrhage with mid-line shift, and one large subdural hematoma requiring emergent surgery.

- **Conclusions**: Due to the catastrophic nature of missing an intracranial hemorrhage in the emergency department, the D-dimer assay alone may not be sufficient to reliably exclude outcome[s] such as hemorrhages. Further diagnostic evaluation with CT scanning should be considered in these high-risk scenarios.

### Pulmonary embolism and increased levels of d-dimer in patients with coronavirus disease [^113CeNys]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2020). Low credibility.

We report three patients with coronavirus disease who experienced a decline in respiratory status during their hospital course, which responded well to intravenous steroids and interleukin-6 receptor antagonist therapy. These patients later showed development of persistent hypoxia with increased levels of d-dimer and were given a diagnosis of pulmonary embolisms.

### Four cases of acute infectious urticaria showing significant elevation of plasma D-dimer level [^114hinT9]. The Journal of Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

D-dimer, a fibrinolytic end-product, has been regarded as a biomarker indicating the severity of urticaria, especially in chronic urticaria. Regarding acute urticaria, the D-dimer level is also suggested to be elevated, which may be significant in comparison with chronic urticaria. However, the clinical features of acute urticaria with concomitant significant elevation of D-dimer level have not been investigated in detail. We present four cases of acute urticaria fulfilling the proposed diagnostic criterion of acute infectious urticaria, in which significant elevation of D-dimer level and rapid spontaneous normalization occur in parallel with the resolution of fever and urticaria.

No cases had deep vein thrombosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, or malignancy. All cases responded well to antihistaminic treatment in combination with antibiotics, and their fever and urticaria resolved within 10 days. All cases showed severe wheals persistent for several days, resolving with hyperpigmentation. Histologically, infiltration into blood vessel walls and interstitial infiltration of lymphocytes and polymorphonuclear cells were marked in the dermis. In our cases, clinical features accorded with acute infectious urticaria, and their histological features were similar to those of neutrophilic urticaria as described previously.

In conclusion, there is a certain group of acute urticaria associated with significant elevation of D-dimer level. These common features of our cases may be characteristic of acute urticaria showing coagulative and fibrinolytic abnormalities.

### How we manage a high D-dimer [^1145BaEj]. Haematologica (2024). Low credibility.

It has previously been pointed out that the detection of increased D-dimer does not necessarily imply the presence of an underlying disease, as there are several physiological conditions accompanied by abnormal values. D-dimer increases with age, leading to a greater proportion of older patients (> 50%) with values higher than the conventional cutoff of 500 µg/L. The lower specificity of D-dimer for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in older compared to younger people implies that older individuals are unlikely to have negative D-dimer results, even when VTE is absent, resulting in a high rate of unnecessary imaging tests. For this reason, an age-adjusted cutoff has been validated and recommended in the diagnostic workup of VTE. However, in patients over 80 years of age, the use of D-dimer measurement is not recommended for the exclusion of VTE, due to high baseline levels leading to unacceptably high false positive results in cases without VTE.

- **Physiological conditions**:
	- D-dimer levels increase physiologically during pregnancy and in the post-partum period. Levels are also higher in women taking oral contraceptives than in non-users, perhaps reflecting their hypercoagulable state. Exercise affects hemostasis, depending on the duration and intensity of physical activity. D-dimer levels significantly increase following short-duration strenuous exercise, and exercise-induced fibrinolytic activity in healthy subjects is proportional to the effort exerted.

### Excluding venous thromboembolism using point of care D-dimer tests in outpatients: a diagnostic meta-analysis [^115AMDWA]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

Fourthly, we restricted our search to studies published in English only, which could have been a potential source of bias. However, we complemented our electronic searches with recommendations from experts in the field, and this approach retrieved no non-English studies. Additionally, non-English studies often have little effect on summary estimates in meta-analyses.

Fifthly, although the quality of the included studies was generally good, several studies exhibited differential verification bias and/or incorporation bias (30% and 31%, respectively). Differential verification bias refers to the use of different reference standards for positive and negative test results. For example, patients with a positive point of care D-dimer test result undergo invasive imaging as the reference standard, while patients with negative test results only receive follow-up or less invasive imaging tests as the reference standard. Incorporation bias occurs when the index test is also part of the reference standard. For instance, venous thromboembolism is excluded in patients with a low probability ventilation-perfusion scan only if the point of care D-dimer (index test) is negative. Lijmer et al. have demonstrated that both forms of bias can affect (often overestimate) the diagnostic performance of an index test. However, adding both forms of bias into a covariate analysis did not change the overall sensitivity and specificity of SimpliRED D-dimer and Clearview Simplify D-dimer. A covariate analysis was not possible for Cardiac D-dimer and Triage D-dimer due to the limited number of studies available.

### Excluding venous thromboembolism using point of care D-dimer tests in outpatients: a diagnostic meta-analysis [^117NFvQE]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

Two systematic reviews concluded that a low clinical probability, as assessed by the clinical decision rule developed by Wells et al, and a negative result on SimpliRED D-dimer (a point of care assay; Agen Biomedical, Brisbane, Australia) could safely exclude venous thromboembolism. There has nevertheless been much discussion about the diagnostic accuracy and applicability of this semiqualitative point of care D-dimer test, mainly due to the low interobserver agreement associated with this assay. Perhaps as a consequence, several new point of care D-dimer tests have been introduced in recent years. Such tests have never been subject to a formal (diagnostic) meta-analysis because studies on their diagnostic performance were unavailable at the time of the two latest systematic reviews. Before these new point of care tests are widely implemented in daily practice, however, their diagnostic performance must be thoroughly evaluated. We conducted a diagnostic meta-analysis to assess the accuracy of all currently available point of care D-dimer tests, with a particular focus on their ability to exclude either deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) in suspected outpatients.

### Decision-making with D-dimer in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^115qeJk9]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The measurement of D-dimer can provide useful information to aid in the diagnosis of patients with suspected venous thromboembolism. D-dimer measurement, in conjunction with adequate estimation of pretest probability, can facilitate the safe discharge of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism and limit unnecessary investigation or anticoagulation. We review clinical decision-making strategies in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and propose means to minimize diagnostic error that might arise from knowledge of the D-dimer result prior to clinical assessment.

### How we manage a high D-dimer [^1144PcsQ]. Haematologica (2024). Low credibility.

While the role of D-dimer in the diagnostic workup of acute illnesses such as VTE, DIC, and sepsis is well established, managing ambulatory individuals with high D-dimer levels but no evidence of thrombosis presents a challenge. This issue has gained greater attention due to the widespread and indiscriminate use of D-dimer testing during and following the COVID-19 pandemic. When a seemingly healthy and asymptomatic person is referred for persistently high D-dimer, they should first be reassured by explaining all possible reasons, other than disease, that may underlie this abnormality. Nevertheless, an abnormal D-dimer should not be overlooked in otherwise asymptomatic subjects. These individuals should have access to differential diagnostic procedures, considering all possible conditions associated with increased D-dimer levels.

### D-dimer level is associated with the severity of COVID-19 [^1135G5h3]. Thrombosis Research (2020). Low credibility.

Abnormal coagulation function has been demonstrated to be involved in the disease progression of COVID-19. However, the association between D-dimer levels and the severity of COVID-19 is not clear. The study aimed to investigate the association between D-dimer levels and the severity of COVID-19 based on a cohort study and meta-analysis.

- **Materials and methods**: Demographic and clinical data of all confirmed cases with COVID-19 on admission to Tongji Hospital from January 27 to March 5, 2020, were collected and analyzed. Coagulation function parameters were described and compared between patients with severe infection and those with non-severe infection. Cohort studies reporting risk estimates for the D-dimer and severity of COVID-19 association were searched and included to perform a meta-analysis.

- **Results**: In our cohort study, patients with severe disease were more likely to exhibit dysregulated coagulation function. A significantly higher D-dimer level (median 1.8 μg/ml [interquartile range 0.9–4.6] vs 0.5 [0.3–1.1], p < 0.001) was found in severe cases than the mild ones on admission. In the meta-analysis of 13 cohort studies (including the study), patients with severe disease had an increase in mean D-dimer value by 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.51–1.31, p < 0.001) μg/ml compared to those with non-severe disease. The odds of severe infection were associated with a D-dimer greater than 0.5 μg/ml (odds ratio = 5.78, 95% confidence interval, 2.16–15.44, p < 0.001) on admission.

Conclusions were truncated and thus are not included.

### Comparison of the age-adjusted and clinical probability-adjusted D-dimer to exclude pulmonary embolism in the ED [^114nx8TY]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

Diagnosing pulmonary embolism (PE) in the emergency department (ED) can be challenging because its signs and symptoms are non-specific. We compared the efficacy and safety of using age-adjusted D-dimer interpretation, clinical probability-adjusted D-dimer interpretation, and the standard D-dimer approach to exclude PE in ED patients.

We performed a health records review at two emergency departments over a two-year period. We reviewed all cases where patients had a D-dimer ordered to test for PE or underwent CT or VQ scanning for PE. PE was considered to be present during the emergency department visit if PE was diagnosed on CT or VQ (subsegmental level or above), or if the patient was subsequently found to have PE or deep vein thrombosis during the next 30 days. We applied the three D-dimer approaches to the low and moderate probability patients. The primary outcome was the exclusion of PE with each rule. The secondary objective was to estimate the negative predictive value (NPV) for each rule.

A total of 1163 emergency patients were tested for PE, and 1075 patients were eligible for inclusion in our analysis. PE was excluded in 70.4% (95% CI 67.6–73.0%), 80.3% (95% CI 77.9–82.6%), and 68.9% (95% CI 65.7–71.3%) with the age-adjusted, clinical probability-adjusted, and standard D-dimer approach. The NPVs were 99.7% (95% CI 99.0–99.9%), 99.1% (95% CI 98.3–99.5%), and 100% (95% CI 99.4–100.0%) respectively.

The clinical probability-adjusted rule appears to exclude PE in a greater proportion of patients, with a very small reduction in the negative predictive value.

### An evaluation of D-dimer in the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism: A randomized trial [^115J9k13]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). High credibility.

It may be safe to omit additional diagnostic testing in selected patients with suspected pulmonary embolism (PE) who have a negative D-dimer test, but this approach has never been evaluated in a randomized, controlled trial.

- **Objective**: To determine if additional diagnostic testing can be safely withheld in patients with suspected PE who have negative erythrocyte agglutination D-dimer test results.

- **Design**: Randomized comparisons in two subgroups of a prospective multicenter study.

- **Setting**: Seven university hospitals.

- **Patients**: 1,126 outpatients or inpatients with suspected PE, of whom 456 patients with negative erythrocyte agglutination D-dimer test results were randomly assigned to the intervention groups. Patients were classified into two clinical probability groups: (1) those with a low clinical probability of PE (low-probability group), and (2) those with a moderate or high clinical probability of PE, a nondiagnostic ventilation-perfusion lung scan, and no evidence of proximal deep venous thrombosis on bilateral ultrasonography (moderate- or high-probability group).

- **Interventions**: The experimental intervention for both probability groups was no further diagnostic testing for PE. The control intervention for the low-probability group was a ventilation-perfusion lung scan followed by ultrasonography of the proximal deep veins of the legs on the same day. If the lung scan was nondiagnostic, ultrasonography of the legs was repeated 7 and 14 days later. The control intervention for the moderate- or high-probability group was ultrasonography of the proximal deep veins of the…

### Increased D-dimer value and occult cancer in the absence of detectable thrombosis [^112mvG7L]. Haematologica (2007). Low credibility.

Fibrin formation and removal occur continuously during the development of malignancy. Consequently, hemostatic disorders in cancer patients are frequently observed and range from asymptomatic laboratory changes to massive thromboembolism or hemorrhage. We document the case of an asymptomatic woman who was enrolled as a healthy control in a study and presented with a substantially increased D-dimer value. After ruling out the most probable sources of D-dimer elevation, such as thrombosis, inflammation, and trauma, she underwent laboratory and radiological investigations for malignancy, which were consistent with colorectal metastatic adenocarcinoma. This case allows us to hypothesize that screening for occult malignancy in the presence of apparently inexplicable elevated D-dimer values may be considered.

### Comparison between D-dimer levels in diabetic and non-diabetic positive COVID-19 adult patients: A hospital-based study [^1133YTbK]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2022). Low credibility.

COVID‐19 is caused by SARS‐CoV‐2. The spread and severity of SARS‐CoV‐2 infections among individuals can be linked to health status and exposure. Several reasons for this have been highlighted globally and may be responsible for the extent and severity of COVID‐19 during the past year. It is well recognized that the extent and severity of the infection are related to diabetic status. Some potential mechanisms explaining this situation include an altered immune response, a cytokine storm, and glucose metabolism.

Diabetes patients have a greater risk of acquiring various infections. Reports have concluded that diabetes mellitus (DM) is a high‐risk comorbidity in COVID-19 patients, possibly due to other risk factors such as hypertension, age, and obesity, which are associated with diabetes. There may also be intrinsic factors in DM patients that make them more vulnerable to cytokine storms. This condition may result from an imbalance between fibrinolysis and coagulation factors, potentially leading to thrombotic events and subsequent death. D-dimer, a fibrin degradation product, is widely used as a biomarker of thromboembolism for critical cases and as a prognostic marker. Thus, as a biomarker to predict the significance and risk of the disease, D-dimer has been considered relevant because COVID-19 is a pro-coagulant state. Many laboratory markers can predict the severity of COVID-19; these are mainly associated with poor outcomes and include LDH, CRP, high D-dimer, and high‐sensitivity cardiac troponin I.

### Diagnostic accuracy of conventional or age adjusted D-dimer cut-off values in older patients with suspected venous thromboembolism: Systematic review and meta-analysis [^116SZ4wq]. BMJ (2013). Low credibility.

Another limitation might be that we included studies both with populations suspected of having pulmonary embolism and with populations suspected of having deep vein thrombosis, and primary as well as secondary care patients, which might have introduced some extra between-study variation. Furthermore, there was a variation in the prevalence of venous thromboembolism in the included cohorts, ranging from 5.1% to 39%. However, although previous studies revealed an association between the prevalence of venous thromboembolism and the diagnostic accuracy of D-dimer testing, our covariate analysis did not show such an association. Moreover, there was a fair similarity of study design and patient selection over the included cohorts; in all studies, only patients with a non-high clinical probability were selected. Therefore, we assumed that the conditions for pooling were met.

Finally, the reference standards used to diagnose or exclude venous thromboembolism differed between the included studies. In all but one study, differential verification was of concern; in these studies, venous thromboembolism was excluded without confirmation by imaging in patients with a negative D-dimer test result and without recurrence of symptoms during follow-up. Hence, the false negative cases from using the conventional cut-off value were patients presenting with worsening or recurrence of their symptoms within 45 days or three months, leading to further examinations and the detection of venous thromboembolism. Although this is common practice, it could have introduced small overestimations of the diagnosis.

### Is the ordering of imaging for suspected venous thromboembolism consistent with D-dimer result [^1128WeVk]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

We assessed whether the ordering of imaging studies in patients with suspected venous thromboembolism was consistent with the results of D-dimer testing.

- **Methods**: We performed a retrospective chart review of consecutive cases in which a D-dimer assay was performed at an urban academic emergency department during a 13-month period. Measurements included D-dimer results and results of imaging for venous thromboembolism. The primary outcome measure was the percentage of patients in each D-dimer category (positive or negative result with a cutoff value of 500 ng fibrinogen equivalent units/dL) who underwent subsequent imaging within 48 hours. We also report the results of the imaging studies obtained.

- **Results**: A total of 553 D-dimer tests were ordered, with 266 (48.1%) negative and 287 (51.9%) positive results. Of patients with a negative D-dimer result, 37 (14%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 10% to 19%) underwent at least 1 imaging study. Of patients with a positive D-dimer result, 137 (48%; 95% CI 42% to 54%) did not undergo imaging.

- **Conclusion**: Evaluation for venous thromboembolism occasionally proceeded despite a negative D-dimer result, whereas frequently no further evaluation occurred despite a positive result. These findings suggest that actual clinical practice differs from what is recommended by published algorithms that guide evaluation of patients with suspected venous thromboembolism.

### Elevated levels of D-dimer tested by immunoturbidimetry are associated with the extent of severity of pre-eclampsia [^115R3Cjp]. International Journal of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (2020). Low credibility.

To establish the association between increased levels of D-dimer and severity of pre-eclampsia, a nested, prospective cohort, analytical case-control study was conducted among women with pre-eclampsia between March 2017 and March 2018. Inclusion criteria were age over 18 years, gestational age of more than 20 weeks, a single pregnancy with a living fetus, and a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia. D-dimer was measured by immunoturbidimetry at the time of diagnosis of pre-eclampsia, applying cut-off points adjusted for gestational age. Statistical analysis involved unconditional logistic regression for the association of elevated D-dimer with severe pre-eclampsia adjusted by confounding variables.

There were 132 patients with pre-eclampsia, of which 44 were classed as controls and 88 were classed as having severe pre-eclampsia (case group). Cohort characteristics included age between 18 and 45 years (mean 28.0 ± 6.3 years); presence of gestational hypertension (10.6%), chronic arterial hypertension (9.0%); and gestational diabetes (5.3%). In the case group, levels of D-dimer were significantly higher than in controls (19.3% vs 2.3%, odds ratio [OR] 10.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32–80.14, P = 0.004), as well as significant in the unconditional logistic regression model adjusted for maternal age, parity, gestational age, and comorbidities (OR 10.02, 95% CI 1.28–78.68, P = 0.028).

Elevated levels of D-dimer and severe pre-eclampsia are strongly associated, reinforcing evidence that one of the physiopathologic bases of the condition is thecoagulation cascade.

### Characteristics and treatment outcomes of acute type A aortic dissection with elevated D-dimer concentration [^116oktvR]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2018). Low credibility.

The usefulness of D-dimer as a marker of disease activity has been investigated in other maladies. In patients with pulmonary embolism, the D-dimer concentration is related to thrombus volume assessed by contrast-enhanced CT, and a high D-dimer concentration of > 5000 ng/mL is a risk factor for in-hospital mortality. Similarly, in patients with deep vein thrombosis, the ultrasound-based estimated thrombus volume correlates with the D-dimer concentration. These findings are consistent with the finding that D-dimer elevation is associated with extensive aortic dissection. The insight gained from our study is that the D-dimer concentration is related to the extent of dissection in patients with ATAAD regardless of the FL status. Patients with intramural hematoma-type dissection are reported to have a relatively low D-dimer concentration. We confirmed that the D-dimer elevation is milder in patients with a completely thrombosed FL or a ULP-type FL than in patients with a patent FL. In cases of AAD, D-dimer is produced in the FL of the dissecting aorta. Release into the systemic circulation may result in D-dimer elevation in patients with a patent FL. The D-dimer concentrations were highest in our patients with a partially thrombosed FL, regardless of the extent of dissection. Nagaoka et al. reported an elevated fibrinogen degradation products concentration in patients with acute type B aortic dissection and a partially thrombosed FL (n = 14; median, 18.8 μg/mL) in comparison to that in similar patients with a patent or thrombosed FL (n = 21; median, 5.5).

### Excluding venous thromboembolism using point of care D-dimer tests in outpatients: a diagnostic meta-analysis [^115W3Wv6]. BMJ (2009). Low credibility.

We defined a priori the following clinical and design characteristics of a study as potential relevant covariates: type of venous thromboembolism (DVT or PE); proportion of patients with a proximal DVT (for DVT studies only); proportion of patients with a reDVT (for DVT studies only); proportion of patients with an active malignancy; and proportion of patients with recent surgery (< 4 weeks). The QUADAS tool criteria, in particular differential verification and incorporation bias, were also examined as potential sources of bias.

To graphically present the results, we plotted the individual and summary points of sensitivity and specificity in a receiver operating characteristic graph, plotting the index test's sensitivity (true positive rate) on the y-axis against 1-specificity (false negative rate) on the x-axis. In addition, we plotted the 95% confidence region and a 95% prediction region around the pooled estimates to illustrate the precision with which the pooled values were estimated (confidence ellipse of a mean) and to show the amount of between-study variation (prediction ellipse; the likely range of values for a new study).

Finally, we estimated the predictive value of the point of care D-dimer tests. Given that D-dimer testing is predominantly used to exclude venous thromboembolism, the post-test probability of a negative D-dimer test — that is, the negative predictive value — is of the highest importance. The incidence of venous thromboembolism following normal results from imaging tests is around 2% for patients suspected of DVT.
