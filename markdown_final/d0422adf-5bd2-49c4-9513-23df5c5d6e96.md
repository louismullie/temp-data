## Question

What is the Vonoprazan duration for h pylori

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the optimal duration of vonoprazan-based therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication and how it varies by regimen and guideline context. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the FDA-labeled durations for the approved vonoprazan products. Then, I should verify what major guidelines (ACG, AGA) recommend regarding duration. Next, I will examine randomized trials that tested 7, 10, and 14 days to see how efficacy compares. After that, I need to consider regional practice patterns and resistance contexts. Finally, I will synthesize a practical recommendation with caveats for special situations like refractory infection or penicillin allergy.

> Let me first confirm the regulatory baseline. The FDA labeling for vonoprazan (Voquezna) specifies 14 days for both the triple therapy (vonoprazan 20 mg twice daily with amoxicillin 1,000 mg twice daily and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily) and the dual therapy (vonoprazan 20 mg twice daily with amoxicillin 1,000 mg three times daily), which anchors the default duration in the United States at 14 days [^116TRFeZ] [^111uU83q].

> Wait, let me verify guideline convergence before drawing conclusions. The ACG 2024 guideline recommends 14 days for first-line regimens including vonoprazan-based dual and triple therapy, aligning with FDA labeling and emphasizing the importance of duration for efficacy, while the AGA 2024 Best Practice Advice similarly advises a 14-day duration for H. pylori treatment when using P-CAB regimens, reinforcing 14 days as the standard in North American practice [^111rJiVX] [^114LEk3k].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about shorter courses just because some trials used them. I need to check the randomized data comparing durations. A 2024 multicenter randomized study comparing 10-day versus 14-day vonoprazan–amoxicillin dual therapy found noninferiority of the 10-day regimen to the 14-day regimen in both ITT and per-protocol analyses, suggesting that 10 days can be effective in selected populations, although this remains conditional and not a universal substitute for 14 days in all settings [^1137B9Mi]. Let me also consider head-to-head evidence: multiple randomized trials in China have shown 10-day vonoprazan–amoxicillin dual therapy achieving approximately 90–91% eradication and noninferiority to 14-day bismuth-based quadruple therapy, supporting the viability of 10 days in some regions and populations [^114vcPuT] [^111MDgpS] [^115BhEJm].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought 7 days might suffice broadly because Japanese studies achieved around 85–87% eradication with 7-day vonoprazan–amoxicillin dual therapy, but I should double-check generalizability. The Japanese randomized trial showed acceptable 7-day results in a population with low amoxicillin resistance and specific dosing patterns, yet ACG/AGA still recommend 14 days for most patients in North America, and 7-day regimens have not consistently achieved the ≥ 90% target outside Japan, so 7 days should be viewed as region- or population-specific rather than a global standard [^1164rugM] [^111rJiVX] [^114LEk3k].

> I need to ensure I account for resistance and pharmacologic context. Vonoprazan's potent, rapid, and CYP2C19-independent acid suppression likely enables shorter effective durations in some settings, but clarithromycin resistance and variable amoxicillin MIC distributions can still undermine shorter courses. Thus, while 10-day dual therapy has performed well in Asian cohorts, guideline bodies in North America continue to prioritize 14 days to maximize eradication probability across heterogeneous resistance patterns [^114LEk3k] [^111rJiVX] [^114sAhy8].

> But wait, what if the patient is treatment-experienced or has refractory infection? I should confirm that refractory cases warrant longer, optimized therapy. Expert guidance recommends 14 days for refractory H. pylori and emphasizes adherence, acid-suppression optimization, and, when feasible, susceptibility-guided regimens after multiple failures, which reinforces maintaining a 14-day duration in salvage scenarios rather than shortening [^1114oSSU] [^114D5RpX].

> Let me synthesize a practical answer. For most adults in the United States and regions following North American guidance, the standard vonoprazan duration is 14 days for both dual and triple therapy, consistent with FDA labeling and ACG/AGA recommendations. In selected treatment-naïve patients, particularly in settings with low amoxicillin resistance and based on emerging randomized data, a 10-day vonoprazan–amoxicillin dual regimen can be considered, recognizing that this remains conditional and should be individualized; 7-day regimens are not broadly recommended outside specific contexts like Japan and may underperform the ≥ 90% benchmark in many populations [^116TRFeZ] [^111rJiVX] [^114LEk3k] [^1137B9Mi] [^114vcPuT].

The standard duration of vonoprazan-based therapy for H. pylori is **14 days** [^111MgPA5] for both triple and dual regimens, as approved by the FDA and recommended by ACG/AGA guidelines [^114LEk3k] [^111rJiVX]. Ten-day vonoprazan–amoxicillin dual therapy is **noninferior to 14-day bismuth quadruple therapy** in RCTs [^114vcPuT] and may be considered where 14 days is not feasible, but 14 days remains the guideline-preferred duration for most patients [^114LEk3k]. Seven-day regimens are **not recommended** due to lower eradication rates [^1164rugM].

---

## Approved and recommended duration

- **FDA-approved duration**: 14 days for vonoprazan-based triple and dual therapy [^116TRFeZ] [^111uU83q].
- **ACG/AGA guidelines**: recommend 14 days for first-line vonoprazan regimens [^114LEk3k] [^111rJiVX].

---

## Clinical evidence supporting 14-day duration

Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses show **14-day vonoprazan regimens achieve high eradication rates** (≈90–95%) and are noninferior to bismuth quadruple therapy [^112fzYd5] [^116jXs4k] [^117EVqvq]. They also provide **superior efficacy in clarithromycin-resistant strains** compared with PPI-based regimens [^11388iZv] [^114LEk3k].

---

## Evidence for shorter durations

- **10-day dual therapy**: vonoprazan 20 mg BID + amoxicillin 1,000 mg TID achieved ≈90% eradication and was noninferior to 14-day bismuth quadruple therapy in RCTs [^114vcPuT] [^111MDgpS] [^113GnRe8].
- **7-day regimens**: lower eradication rates (≈85–87%) and are not guideline-recommended outside Japan [^1164rugM] [^111rJiVX].

---

## Factors influencing duration choice

- **Patient factors**: adherence, tolerability, and prior antibiotic exposure [^1114oSSU] [^116aDG31].
- **Resistance patterns**: high clarithromycin resistance favors 14-day vonoprazan regimens [^114LEk3k] [^11388iZv].
- **Clinical setting**: 10-day dual therapy may be considered when 14 days is not feasible, with close follow-up [^114vcPuT] [^111MDgpS].

---

## Summary of evidence by duration

| **Duration** | **Regimen** | **Eradication rate** | **Guideline recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| 7 days | Vonoprazan + amoxicillin | ≈85–87% | Not recommended outside Japan |
| 10 days | Vonoprazan + amoxicillin | ≈90% | Conditionally acceptable |
| 14 days | Vonoprazan + amoxicillin ± clarithromycin | ≈90–95% | Strongly recommended |

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

- **Standard duration**: 14 days is the guideline-preferred duration for vonoprazan-based H. pylori therapy [^114LEk3k] [^111rJiVX].
- **Alternative duration**: 10-day dual therapy is a reasonable alternative when 14 days is not feasible, with similar efficacy in RCTs [^114vcPuT] [^111MDgpS].
- **Not recommended**: 7-day regimens due to lower efficacy and limited supporting evidence outside Japan [^112L8xhG] [^111rJiVX].

---

The **bottom line**: use **14 days** for vonoprazan-based H. pylori therapy; consider **10 days** only if adherence or access limits the longer course, and avoid 7-day regimens.

### Ten-day vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy versus 14-day esomeprazole-amoxicillin dual therapy for first-lineeradication: a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial [^1156G4cj]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

In recent years, high-dose dual therapy (HDDT) consisting of PPI and amoxicillin (3000 mg/day) has gained widespread attention due to its ability to achieve similar eradication rates as BQT, with fewer adverse events and lower costs. The classic HDDT regimen consists of either esomeprazole or rabeprazole (standard dose, qid) and amoxicillin (750 mg, qid), taken for 14 days. Increasing the dosage and frequency of PPI and amoxicillin can help maintain therapeutic blood levels of both drugs, creating a high pH environment in the stomach that is conducive to the growth of H. pylori. This, in turn, enhances the sensitivity of H. pylori to amoxicillin. Vonoprazan, a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker, was approved for H. pylori eradication in Japan in 2015. Compared to PPIs, it offers faster, stronger, and longer-lasting acid inhibitory effects. Therefore, theoretically speaking, the combination of vonoprazan and amoxicillin could achieve a better eradication effect. Previous results from two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in China indicated that the 7-day vonoprazan–amoxicillin (VA) dual therapy did not achieve satisfactory eradication rates. However, there is still controversy surrounding the 10-day VA dual therapy. A small sample single-center RCTrevealed that the 10-day VA dual therapy (vonoprazan 20 mg bid + amoxicillin 1000 mg tid) had an eradication rate of 81.1% for both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses, indicating that it may not offer satisfactory eradication rates for the Chinese population. Conversely, a slightly larger single-center RCTin China demonstrated that the 10-day VA dual therapy (vonoprazan 20 mg bid + amoxicillin 750 mg qid) yielded similar eradication rates to the 10-day BQT, with ITT analysis showing 91.2% versus 88.0% and PP analysis showing 93.4% versus 90.9%. Up to now, there is a lack of high-quality multicenter trial data directly comparing the efficacy of the 10-day VA dual therapy with the 14-day esomeprazole–amoxicillin (EA) dual therapy as a first-line treatment for H. pylori eradication.

Background

The efficacy of the 14-day esomeprazole-amoxicillin (EA) dual therapy in eradicating Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) has been widely discussed previously. Vonoprazan, a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker, presents rapid, potent, and long-lasting acid inhibitory effects compared to esomeprazole. However, there is currently a scarcity of direct comparisons between the 10-day vonoprazan-amoxicillin (VA) and the 14-day EA dual therapy for H. pylori eradication.

Objectives

This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of the 10-day VA and the 14-day EA dual therapy for H. pylori first-line eradication.

Design

This study was a prospective, multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial.

Methods

The study was conducted at 10 hospitals in China. In total, 570 newly diagnosed H. pylori -infected patients were recruited from April 2023 to February 2024. These patients were randomly assigned to either the 10-day VA group (vonoprazan 20mg twice daily+amoxicillin 1000mg three times daily) or the 14-day EA group (esomeprazole 20mg four times daily+amoxicillin 750mg four times daily). The primary outcome was the eradication rate, with secondary outcomes including adverse events and compliance.

Results

The 10-day VA regimen outperformed the 14-day EA regimen in terms of eradication rates in intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis (85.4% vs 76.7%, p = 0.008), modified ITT analysis (90.7% vs 84.8%, p = 0.036), and per-protocol (PP) analysis (91.1% versus 85.5%, p = 0.047). The non-inferiority p -values in all three analyses were less than 0.001. No statistically significant difference was observed in the incidence of adverse events between the two groups (9.1% vs 11.7%, p = 0.308). The 10-day VA regimen demonstrated higher compliance compared to the 14-day EA regimen (p = 0.006).

Conclusion

The 10-day VA dual therapy showed a satisfactory eradication rate of 91.1% (PP analysis), demonstrating good safety and better compliance compared to the 14-day EA dual therapy as the first-line eradication.

Trial Registration

This trial was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (registration number: ChiCTR2300070475) on April 12, 2023.

### Brief communication: global temporal trends in the efficacy of clarithromycin-based regimens for the treatment ofinfection [^1142Wz4Z]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

In a recent network meta-analysis which provided an indirect comparison of available H. pylori eradication regimens, vonoprazan-based triple therapy showed the highest relative efficacy, ranking higher according to surface under the cumulative rank than bismuth quadruple therapy and all PPI-based triple therapy regimens (regardless of individual PPI backbone). Interestingly, vonoprazan dual therapy with amoxicillin ranked second only to vonoprazan-based triple therapy versus individual PPI triple therapies, providing further evidence that the more durable and potent acid suppression provided by vonoprazan may support maintained stability and optimal effectiveness of amoxicillin compared to PPIs.

The interpretation of the results of this temporal analysis is limited by the amount of available published evidence for vonoprazan-based triple therapy, since it has only recently become available in the United States. It was not feasible to correct for the heterogeneity of dosage and duration of treatment in multivariable models due to the limited amount of data. Among the studies analyzed, amoxicillin dosage was largely comparable between vonoprazan studies and other studies from 2015 onward.

### AGA clinical practice update on integrating potassium-competitive acid blockers into clinical practice: expert review [^114LEk3k]. Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Management of Helicobacter pylori — Best Practice Advice 7: Clinicians should use P-CABs in place of PPIs in eradication regimens for most patients with HP infection. Evidence includes a systematic review of 7 Asian randomized trials showing higher first-line eradication with vonoprazan vs PPI (92% vs 80%). A duration of 14 days is generally advised for HP treatment, and US approval for vonoprazan-based regimens was for 14 days. In randomized trials, a Japanese study with 335 patients reported similar eradication with 7-day vonoprazan dual therapy vs vonoprazan-based triple therapy (85% vs 89%), and a Singaporean trial with 244 patients found similar rates comparing 1 week of vonoprazan-based triple therapy with 2 weeks of PPI-based triple therapy (87% vs 88%). In patients with clarithromycin-resistant strains, the Japanese trial showed higher success after 1 week of vonoprazan dual therapy (92% vs 76%). In a large multinational trial, eradication rates were superior for both vonoprazan triple therapy (81%) and dual therapy (77%) compared with lansoprazole triple therapy (69%), although eradication rates in all arms of the trial were < 90%. For second-line treatment, a meta-analysis of 16 Japanese studies found vonoprazan-based regimens superior to PPI-based regimens (odds ratio, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.3–1.8).

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^116aDG31]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

ACG clinical guideline — Recommendation 4: In treatment-naive patients with Helicobacter pylori infection and unknown clarithromycin susceptibility, PCAB-clarithromycin triple therapy is suggested over PPI-clarithromycin triple therapy (conditional recommendation; moderate quality evidence). We advise against the use of clarithromycin in any treatment regimen unless there is evidence that a patient is infected with a clarithromycin-sensitive strain of H. pylori; if susceptibility is not known and there is no history of macrolide use and no alternative first-line therapy is available, evidence supports a 14-day, twice-daily triple regimen that includes clarithromycin and amoxicillin with a potassium-competitive acid blocker (PCAB) instead of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). In prespecified analyses, vonoprazan-clarithromycin triple therapy was superior among clarithromycin-resistant strains (eradication rates by mITT 66% vs 32%, P < 0.0001) and in the entire study population (mITT 81% vs 69%, P < 0.0003); diarrhea (4%) and dysgeusia (4%) were the most commonly reported adverse events. A network meta-analysis reported vonoprazan-based triple therapy had 72% probability of being the most efficacious.

### Efficacy and safety of vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy forfirst-line treatment: a single-center, randomized, controlled trial [^113jNSVZ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our present study indicated that high-dose VA dual therapy achieved a good eradication rate in first-line treatment of H. pylori infection, which was not inferior to bismuth quadruple therapy containing amoxicillin and clarithromycin, with a lower frequency of adverse events. VA dual therapy was a simple, effective, and safe eradication regimen, which was not affected by clarithromycin resistance.

As one of the most prescribed antibiotics in H. pylori eradication, amoxicillin interferes with peptidoglycan synthesis and damages bacterial cell walls to achieve a bactericidal effect by binding to penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Resistance of H. pylori to amoxicillin is mainly mediated by mutations of PBPs-related genes. In most cases, single amino acid substitution mediates only low to moderate levels of resistance, while accumulation of multiple point mutations leads to higher resistance levels. Since the accumulation of point mutations is not an easy task, the primary resistance and acquired resistance of H. pylori to amoxicillin are both rare. On the other hand, pharmacokinetic studies have shown that amoxicillin is a time-dependent antibiotic. Increasing the dosing frequency to 600–750 mg per 6 h can maintain the mucosal concentration above the minimum inhibitory concentration for as long as possible so that the bactericidal activity of amoxicillin can be maximized. Meanwhile, the stability of amoxicillin is pH dependent. It is unstable in an acidic environment and achieves maximum stabilization when pH is near 6.0. In addition, when the intragastric pH is over 6, H. pylori enters the replicative state where they become more susceptible to amoxicillin. These factors together determine that amoxicillin is an effective antibiotic for H. pylori eradication and that intragastric pH has a highly significant impact on the effectiveness of amoxicillin.

HDDT, in which high doses of PPIs are administered to increase the intragastric pH, has been shown to have acceptable eradication rates. The advent of P-CAB has made inhibition of gastric acid easier and more effective. P-CAB inhibits both active and resting H +, K + -ATPase by reversible K + -competitive binding, to more strongly inhibit gastric acid secretion. Pharmacodynamic data showed that the intragastric pH was above 4.0 at 4 h after the first administration of VPZ 20 mg and sustained for up to 24 h. Administration of VPZ (20 mg twice daily) for seven consecutive days could maintain the intragastric pH above 5 for almost the whole day. These properties have a favorable synergistic effect with the bactericidal mechanism of amoxicillin so that VA dual therapy can achieve a relatively satisfactory eradication rate.

### Seven-day vonoprazan and low-dose amoxicillin dual therapy as first-linetreatment: a multicentre randomised trial in Japan [^1165HQKG]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first randomised controlled study to reveal the efficacy of a 7-day vonoprazan and low-dose AMO dual therapy. The VA-dual therapy provided acceptable H. pylori eradication rates of 85% in the ITT analysis and 87% in the PP analysis. The eradication rates of the CLA-resistant strain in the VA-dual therapy were higher than those in the VAC-triple therapy. Moreover, adverse events hindered the compliance of VA-dual therapy in only 1%.

Standard triple therapy (STT) consisting of a PPI, AMO and CLA is no longer effective in many regions of the world owing to increasing CLA resistance of H. pylori; four-drug combination therapy such as bismuth-containing quadruple therapy (BQT) or concomitant quadruple therapy (CQT) are currently recommended as first-line treatments in areas with high CLA resistance. In previous studies, the eradication rates ranged 55%–72% for STT in 7 days,80%–95% for BQTand 81%–90% for CQTas first-line H. pylori eradication treatments. The eradication rates of VA-dual and VAC-triple therapies in this study were higher than those previously reported for the 7-day STT and as high as the ones reported for BQT and CQT although the CLA resistance rate was 25% in this study. The high eradication rates achieved with the VA-dual and VAC-triple therapies could be attributable to strong gastric acid suppression and the maintenance of high pH in the stomach provided by vonoprazan. Vonoprazan has a stronger and longer-lasting effect on acid secretion inhibition than other PPIs, and its pharmacokinetic features are not affected by CYP2C19 polymorphism. H. pylori eradication rates of 86%–93% were achieved with a regimen similar to VAC-triple therapy as first-line treatment. Another explanation for the high eradication rates for VA-dual and VAC-triple therapies could be related to the fact that the strain infecting the subjects was not resistant to AMO. H. pylori resistance rate to AMO is still lower than that to other antibiotics and is usually overlooked when determining the H. pylori treatment regimens. However, resistance to AMO substantially differs among world regions (38% in Africa region, 14% in Eastern Mediterranean region, 12% in Southeast Asia region, 8% in Americas region, and 0%–1% in European and Western Pacific regions). The resistance breakpoint was set to MIC ≥ 0.12 µg/mL, which is a stricter cut-off value than the commonly used MIC breakpoint of 0.5 μg/mL; because there was no AMO resistance in this study, VA-dual and VAC-triple therapies could achieve high eradication rates of H. pylori. Thus, both VA-dual and VAC-triple therapies could be alternative regimens as first-line H. pylori treatment in the regions with no AMO resistance. However, as the inverse relationship between H. pylori eradication rate and AMO MIC values was revealed in this study, the efficacy of both VA-dual and VAC-triple therapies might be limited to the regions with moderate to high AMO resistance.

### Brief communication: global temporal trends in the efficacy of clarithromycin-based regimens for the treatment ofinfection [^114sAhy8]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Lack of antibiotic stewardship, short treatment durations, differing usage and policies by geography, and increased, and often inappropriate, use of macrolides have all been possible contributors to increased clarithromycin resistance and decreased effectiveness of clarithromycin-based H. pylori eradication regimens. Guidance from both Europe and North America recommends against first-line empiric H. pylori treatment with clarithromycin containing PPI-based triple therapy because of antibiotic resistance and the risk of potential treatment failure. Nevertheless, a recent review of real-world evidence in North America suggests the PPI-based triple therapies are still commonly used. Recent evidence suggests that triple therapy with the potassium-competitive acid blocker vonoprazan is an effective treatment for H. pylori, offering high rates of eradication, even among patients infected with clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori.

The results of this analysis confirmed that H. pylori eradication rates for PPI-based clarithromycin-based triple therapies have continued to decline over time. Inclusion of vonoprazan-based triple therapy partially mitigated the observed decline in eradication rates. Higher eradication rates observed with vonoprazan-based triple therapyin comparison to the historical eradication rates of PPI-based triple regimens suggest that vonoprazan-based triple therapy may be less impacted by increasing clarithromycin resistance.

Vonoprazan acts on H+, K+-ATPase in parietal cells in an acid-independent manner, providing a rapid antisecretory effect that is maintained over 24 h. Moreover, vonoprazan demonstrated superior acid suppression compared to lansoprazole, with a more rapid and sustained acid-inhibitory effect. Acid suppression and maintenance of an intragastric pH between 6 and 8 is essential to optimal antibiotic action, particularly for amoxicillin, which is acid labile and requires bacterial replication for its antimicrobial effects. Thereby, the efficacy of vonoprazan-based triple therapy may be driven, at least in part, by potent acid suppression and the related effectiveness of amoxicillin, limiting the impact of clarithromycin resistance.

Clinical outcomes of matched vonoprazan-treated and PPI-treated patients

Most patients received a diagnostic test for H. pylori during the follow-up period (86.3% of vonoprazan-treated patients and 81.8% of PPI-treated patients; Table 2), within a mean of 79 days from the index date to the first post-index test in both cohorts.

Fewer vonoprazan-treated than PPI-treated patients subsequently received a prescription for triple therapy between 31 days and 12 months after the index date (7.1% versus 20.0%, respectively, p < 0.001; Figure 3(a)). In addition, fewer vonoprazan-treated than PPI-treated patients received a prescription for vonoprazan or a PPI as monotherapy between 31 days and12 months after the index date (12.4% versus 26.4%, p < 0.001; Figure 3(b)). The mean time from the index date to second-line treatment initiation was 121.5 days for vonoprazan-treated patients and 103.7 days for PPI-treated patients.

### Efficacy and safety of vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual regimen with varying dose and duration for Helicobacter pylori eradication: a multicenter, prospective, randomized study [^1137B9Mi]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Previous studies confirm vonoprazan-amoxicillin effectiveness for Helicobacter pylori. This study aims to investigate vonoprazan with varying amoxicillin dose and duration.

Methods

This multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled, noninferiority trial enrolled patients with treatment naive H pylori infection from 5 clinical centers. Eligible participants were randomly assigned to H-VA-10 (vonoprazan 20 mg twice a day (b.i.d.) + amoxicillin 750 mg 4 times a day, 10 days), L-VA-10 (vonoprazan 20 mg b.i.d. + amoxicillin 1000 mg b.i.d, 10 days), and H-VA-14 (vonoprazan 20 mg b.i.d + amoxicillin 750 mg 4 times a day, 14 days) in a 1:1:1 ratio. The eradication rate was assessed using the ¹³C-urea breath test at least 28 days after treatment.

Results

Of the 623 eligible patients, 516 patients were randomized. In both the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses, eradication rates were comparable between H-VA-10 and H-VA-14 groups (86.6% vs 89.5% and 90.9% vs 94.5%, P = 0.021 and .013 for noninferiority, respectively). However, eradication rates were significantly lower in the L-VA-10 group than the H-VA-14 group (79.7% vs 89.5% and 82.0% vs 94.5%, P = 0.488 and .759, respectively). Rates of study withdrawal, loss to follow-up, and adverse events were similar across study groups.

Conclusions

H-VA-10 and H-VA-14 regimens provide satisfactory efficacy for H pylori infection, and the L-VA-10 regimen was inferior.

### Incidence and type of adverse events in patients taking vonoprazan: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^117T3Cxb]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Due to the lack of relevant data, we were not able to directly analyze the risk factors affecting the safety of vonoprazan. However, we performed subgroup analyses to evaluate the incidence of AEs in patients taking vonoprazan according to various conditions. First, patients with PUD had higher incidences of any AEs, serious AEs, and AEs leading to drug discontinuation than those with GERD, H. pylori infection, and artificial ulcer after gastric ESD. This might be because PUD is more complex and severe than other disease conditions, and requires a longer duration of vonoprazan. Specifically, we included both studies regarding short-term healing of PUD and long-term secondary prevention of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or aspirin-induced PUD into the same subgroup. In short-term healing of PUD studies, some patients with PUD had concomitant H. pylori infection which needs to be eradicated by vonoprazan combined with other drugs. In long-term secondary prevention of PUD studies, patients required a longer duration of vonoprazan. Second, patients with H. pylori infection had a higher incidence of drug-related AEs than those with PUD, GERD, and artificial ulcer after gastric ESD. This was mainly because multiple drugs, including antibiotics, bismuth, and probiotics, should be added along with vonoprazan for H. pylori eradication. Third, it is readily understood that the incidence of AEs was higher in patients taking long-term (> 8 weeks) use of vonoprazan than those taking short-term (≤ 8 weeks) use of vonoprazan. This finding was also observed in patients taking vonoprazan for the management of EE and PUD. Fourth, the race of the population taking vonoprazan (i.e. Asian and non-Asian) might not influence the risk of AEs. Recently, a population pharmacokinetic model evaluated the impact of the population from Asia and Europe on vonoprazan exposure, and also showed that the population effect on vonoprazan exposure was limited. Fifth, the incidence of AEs also seemed to be similar between adult and adolescent patients taking vonoprazan, which suggested that vonoprazan can be safe and well tolerated in both adults and adolescents. However, this finding required further validation in adolescents.

In conclusion, this study revealed a satisfactory H. pylori eradication rate of 90.8% for 10-day VA-dual therapy in Eastern China with low adverse event rate compared with standard 14-day B-quadruple treatment. VA-dual is a promising cost-effective regimen and worth generalization in population-based H. pylori screening and eradication strategy.

### Optimal duration of treatment regimens for H. pylori eradication… [^117WF8oh]. AAFP (2014). Low credibility.

Evidence-Based Answer When using proton pump inhibitor triple therapy, increasing the duration of treatment from seven to 10 days or from 10 to 14 days significantly increases the eradication of H. pylori. When using other treatment regimens, it is unclear whether increasing duration of treatment changes eradication rates. H. pylori eradication improves with a longer duration of PPI triple therapy. The number needed to treat for one additional H. pylori eradication is 21 when treatment is lengthened from seven to 10 days; the NNT is 17 when increasing from 10 to 14 days, and 11 when increasing from seven to 14 days. H.

pylori eradication regimens over the course of seven, 10, or 14 days: PPI plus bismuth salt plus two antibiotics; PPI plus three antibiotics; PPI plus one antibiotic; H₂ blocker plus bismuth salt plus an antibiotic; H₂ blocker plus two antibiotics; bismuth salt plus two antibiotics; and H₂ blocker bismuth quadruple therapy. There were few randomized controlled trials available for each of these treatment regimens. Across the three treatment durations, no significant differences were noted in the rate of H. pylori eradication except with the use of H 2 blocker bismuth quadruple therapy. Only one study was available for this treatment regimen, and the eradication rate was higher in persons treated for 14 days than in those treated for seven days.

The optimal treatment duration for PPI triple therapy is 14 days. This Cochrane review was unable to draw any conclusions about the optimal treatment duration or effectiveness of any alternative H. pylori treatment regimens in comparison with the standard PPI triple therapy because of the paucity of data for alternative regimens.

Drug-related AEs

Thirty-one studies explored the incidence of drug-related AEs in patients taking vonoprazan (Figure 2(b)). Meta-analysis demonstrated that the pooled incidence of drug-related AEs was 7% (95% CI = 5–9%) with significant heterogeneity (I² = 88.8%; p < 0.01). Meta-regression analyses did not find any source of heterogeneity. No significant publication bias was detected (p = 0.987).

In subgroup analyses, the pooled incidence of drug-related AEs was 10, 5, 7, and 0% in patients taking vonoprazan for the management of H. pylori infection, GERD, PUD, and artificial ulcers after gastric ESD, respectively (p interaction < 0.01); 7 and 9% in those for short-term healing of EE and long-term maintenance of healed EE, respectively (p interaction = 0.44); 4 and 17% in those for short-term healing of PUD and long-term secondary prevention of PUD, respectively (p interaction = 0.01); 7 and 6% in those for a duration of > 8 weeks and ≤ 8 weeks, respectively (p interaction = 0.87); and 7 and 7% in adult and adolescent patients taking vonoprazan, respectively (p interaction = 0.83) (Figure 2(b)).

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: expert review [^114D5RpX]. Gastroenterology (2021). Medium credibility.

Inadequate acid suppression may undermine eradication efforts through a variety of mechanisms, as detailed above. To this end, optimal dosing of PPIs is frequently overlooked when prescribing eradication therapy, but similar fine-tuning of the acid suppressive prescription may improve eradication outcomes in refractory H. pylori infection. (BPA #7) Providers should also confirm that patients are taking the PPI in a manner that maximizes absorption and activation; factors such as timing of PPI administration in relation to food (and types of foods) and the impact on absorption, as well as the impact of concomitant medications such as histamine H₂ receptor blockers on PPI activation should be studied further. Higher dosing, greater frequency (e.g. TID or QID PPI dosing), and the use of more potent PPIs (e.g. esomeprazole or rabeprazole) may be beneficial in cases of refractory H. pylori infection and similarly warrant further investigation. Vonoprazan, a first-in-class potassium-competitive acid blocker, is a potent intragastric acid suppressor that also bypasses CYP2C19 -dependent metabolism. Although not yet available in the US, trials comparing CYP2C19 -metabolized PPIs versus vonoprazan are ongoing in the US.

Finally, longer treatment durations provide higher eradication rates; thus, a 14-day therapeutic duration should be used for refractory H. pylori infection. (BPA #8)

After multiple failed eradication attempts, the potential benefits of H. pylori eradication should be weighed carefully against the likelihood of adverse effects and inconvenience of repeated high-dose acid suppression and antibiotic exposure, particularly among individuals who are not at identifiably higher risk of complications from persistent H. pylori infection (e.g. gastric cancer, peptic ulcer disease); in such scenarios, a shared decision-making approach should be seriously considered, especially in the elderly, those with frailty, and those with intolerance to antibiotics (BPA #9)

### Update on the second-line treatment ofinfection: a narrative review [^116RZ6ZR]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Vonoprazan-based second-line therapy

Vonoprazan is a potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB). The new gastric acid suppression agent inhibits gastric acid secretion via reversible suppressing H +/K+-ATPase. Its efficacy of acid inhibition is superior to that of PPI. Vonoprazan is majorly metabolized through CYP 3A4 in the liver and partially by SULT2A1, CYP2C19, CYP2B6, and CYP2D6. Several randomized controlled studies and non-randomized controlled studies demonstrated that a 7-day vonoprazan-based triple therapy was superior to a 7-day PPI-based triple therapy in the first-line H. pylori treatment. However, a randomized controlled trial from Japan was conducted to compare the efficacies of vonoprazan-amoxicillin-metronidazole and rabeprazole-amoxicillin-metronidazole triple therapies in second-line treatment. The results showed no significant differences in eradication rates (90% versus 85% by per-protocol analysis) between the two second-line therapies. Nonetheless, a meta-analysis of non-RCT studies by Shinozaki et al. showed that a vonoprazan-based regimen has significant superiority over a PPI-based regimen for second-line H. pylori eradication therapy. The current Japanese guidelines on the management of H. pylori infections recommend replacing PPI with vonoprazan for first-line and second-line eradication therapies.

14.4	Treatment of Helicobacter pylori Infection

The effectiveness and safety of VOQUEZNA, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin (triple therapy) and VOQUEZNA and amoxicillin (dual therapy) were evaluated in a randomized, controlled, double-blind (triple therapy)/open-label (dual therapy) study conducted in the United States and Europe in treatment-naïve H. pylori -positive adult patients with at least one clinical condition: dyspepsia lasting at least 2 weeks, functional dyspepsia, recent/new diagnosis of peptic ulcer, peptic ulcer not treated for H. pylori infection, or a stable dose of long-term NSAID treatment (NCT04167670). Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to one of the following regimens administered for 14 consecutive days:

VOQUEZNA 20 mg twice daily, amoxicillin 1,000 mg twice daily, and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily
VOQUEZNA 20 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1,000 mg three times daily
lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily, amoxicillin 1,000 mg twice daily, and clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily

H. pylori infection at baseline was defined as positive by13C urea breath test (UBT) and follow-up upper endoscopy (culture or histology). H. pylori eradication was confirmed with a negative13C UBT test-of-cure at least 27 days post-therapy. Patients with negative test results were considered treatment successes. Patients who tested positive for H. pylori infection and patients with missing results from the test-of-cure visit were considered treatment failures.

Table 2.
Rescue therapy or regimen recommendation for Helicobacter pylori in different guidelines.

However, vonoprazan is not widely available in most western countries. In addition, the clinical data supporting the use of vonoprazan-based therapies are limited to East Asian populations, so it is unclear whether these findings can be generalized to other parts of the world. As a result, vonoprazan-based therapy is currently only a viable option in Asia.

Aside from PPIs and P-CABs, lifestyle modification should also be considered in eradication therapy. Smoking, for example, can increase intragastric acid, impair gastric mucosal protection, increases complications in H. pylori -infected patients, and reduce the success rate of H. pylo ri eradication. Although there is no clear evidence to support the idea that smoking cessation can promote successful eradication in refractory H. pylori infection, it is still recommended during eradication therapy. While other factors that increase acid secretion, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), caffeine, and alcohol consumption, are less relevant to H. pylori eradication, they still represent important areas for future research.

### The second Irish Helicobacter pylori working group consensus for the diagnosis and treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adult patients in Ireland [^111sPPdY]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2024). Medium credibility.

The aim of any antimicrobial therapy is to reliably cure H. pylori infection in ≥ 90% of patients. A recent network analysis of the effectiveness of multiple first-line treatments worldwide demonstrated that standard triple therapy was the least efficacious regimen analysed. An audit of first-line clarithromycin triple therapy from Tallaght University Hospital over a 3-year period (2019–2021) revealed a suboptimal eradication rate of 82.5% (N = 227/275). As first-line clarithromycin triple therapy should not be used empirically in areas where clarithromycin resistance is known to be > 15%, and local eradication rates fall below the 90% target, clarithromycin AST, either by culture or molecular methods (see statements 5 and 6) is recommended before prescribing any clarithromycin-containing therapy. Only in cases where clarithromycin susceptibility is confirmed should clarithromycin-based triple therapy (Table 3 and Fig. 1) be prescribed. The European Registry on the Management of H. pylori infection (Hp-EuReg) has demonstrated that longer treatment durations and higher dose PPI are associated with increased eradication rates in their analysis of first-line treatment outcomes in 21 533 patients over a 5-year period (2013–2018). Thus, high-dose PPI and treatment durations of 14 days are recommended. While recent studies have demonstrated the potential of the potassium-competitive acid blocker vonoprazan for acid suppression and enhancing H. pylori eradication rates, vonoprazan is currently not available in Ireland.

### Comparison of efficacy on first-line Helicobacter pylori eradication between potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB)-based therapies versus proton-pump inhibitor (PPI)-based therapies: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112H4BXP]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a gram-negative bacterium that infects over half of the world population, accountable for 89% of all gastric cancer cases. The efficacy of the proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) based-triple therapy is declining, while the novel potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB) based therapy gets new attention. However, it remains unclear regarding the optimal duration and number of comedication(s) for P-CAB-based regimens, which P-CAB is the best-in-class, and whether P-CABs perform better than all PPIs.

Objective

To compare the efficacy on first-line H. pylori eradication between P-CAB-based therapies versus PPI-based therapies.

Methods

A systematic review on randomized controlled trials, with network meta-analysis conducted under the Frequentist approach. The P-score method was used to rank the probability of being the best intervention.

Results

For the first-line treatment eradicating H. pylori infection, the 7-day vonoprazan-based triple therapy (VAC7) has the highest P-score for the probability of being the best intervention (0.96). VAC7 has a significantly higher eradication rate of H. pylori than most PPI-based therapies, including esomeprazole-based, lansoprazole-based, pantoprazole-based, and omeprazole-based regimens, as well as the other P-CAB based regimens, such as tegroprazan-based triple regimen (OR: 2.41, 95% CI: 1.13–5.15).

Conclusion

Vonoprazan-based triple therapy has a higher eradication rate than PPI-based triple therapies, as well as other P-CABs based regimens. It remains unclear whether VAC7 is superior over vonoprazan-based dual therapy (VA7). Overall, VAC7 should be recommended for clinical and public health interventions, with VA7 as a possible alternative considering the local antimicrobial resistance profiles.

### Fourteen-day vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy versus 14-day bismuth-based quadruple therapy fortreatment: a randomized clinical trial [^117EVqvq]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Potassium-competitive acid blockers (P-CABs) have shown potential in Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication, but the efficacy of dual therapy with P-CABs and amoxicillin remains underexplored.

Objectives

This study evaluated the efficacy, safety, and compliance of a 14-day vonoprazan-amoxicillin (VA) dual therapy compared to a bismuth-based quadruple therapy (BQT) in treatment-naive patients.

Design

A randomized clinical trial.

Methods

This single-center, prospective, randomized controlled trial enrolled 250 H. pylori -positive patients from November 2022 to April 2024. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive 14-day VA dual therapy or BQT (lansoprazole, bismuth, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin). The primary outcomes were eradication rates in intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses. Secondary outcomes included adverse events and treatment compliance.

Results

Eradication rates in the ITT analysis were 92.0% for the VA dual group and 88.0% for the BQT group (p = 0.292). In the PP analysis, eradication rates were 95.8% and 91.7%, respectively (p = 0.188). The VA dual group demonstrated statistically significant non-inferiority to the BQT group in both the ITT and PP analyses (both p < 0.001). The incidence of adverse events was significantly lower in the VA dual group compared to the BQT group (11.2% vs 20.8%, p = 0.038), with no severe adverse events reported. The compliance rates of both groups were 97.6%.

Conclusion

The 14-day VA dual therapy is highly effective and well-tolerated, demonstrating non-inferiority to BQT. Given its reduced antibiotic usage and lower adverse events, it may be a viable first-line alternative for H. pylori in southern China.

Trial Registration

This trial was registered on the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry with the registration number ChiCTR2200055752.

### Seven-day vonoprazan and low-dose amoxicillin dual therapy as first-linetreatment: a multicentre randomised trial in Japan [^111GMhU1]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Helicobacter pylori infection is common chronic bacterial infections in humans, affecting approximately 50% of the global population. Although the prevalence of H. pylori is generally declining, the prevalence of the infection and the reinfection rates remain high in several regions. As H. pylori infection causes gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue and gastric cancer, H. pylori eradication treatment is performed worldwide to improve and reduce these conditions.

The eradication effect of H. pylori treatment has decreased owing to increasing its antimicrobial resistance. Recent international guidelines recommend four-drug combination therapies containing 2–3 kinds of antibiotics for 10–14 days as the first-line treatment for H. pylori in regions with high clarithromycin (CLA) resistance to overcome its antimicrobial resistance. However, these quadruple regimens have several disadvantages, including severe side effects, high cost and low compliance due to the use of multiple antibiotic agents for a long period; these features have hampered its implementation in routine clinical practice. Furthermore, the use of multiple antibiotic agents in H. pylori treatment can increase the risk of future antimicrobial resistance. Thus, novel regimens and approaches enabling minimal antibiotic usage and shorter treatment duration are required to prevent antimicrobial resistance while achieving sufficient eradication rates.

Dual therapy composed of a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) and amoxicillin (AMO) is the simplest regimen for H. pylori treatment and, because it is a single antibiotic therapy, we expect it will not contribute to the development of H. pylori antibiotic resistance. Maintaining a near-neutral pH in the stomach during eradication therapy is important to succeed dual therapy regimen. Vonoprazan, a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker, provides a stronger and longer-lasting effect on the gastric acid suppression than other PPIs. Therefore, vonoprazan is expected to be more effective than other PPIs when used in dual therapy with AMO for the H. pylori eradication treatment. However, the efficacy of such dual therapy for H. pylori eradication has not been studied yet and no randomised studies have assessed the efficacy of dual therapy consisting of vonoprazan and AMO for H. pylori eradication.

The aim of this proof of concept study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of the 7-day vonoprazan and low-dose AMO dual therapy (VA-dual) and to compare it with a 7-day vonoprazan, AMO and CLA triple therapy (VAC-triple) as the first-line treatments for H. pylori.

### Efficacy and safety of vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy forfirst-line treatment: a single-center, randomized, controlled trial [^112L8xhG]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

VA dual therapy has aroused considerable concern worldwide and has been reported by many studies in recent years. Recently, several studies have explored the dosage and course of VA dual therapy. – Overall, the eradication rate was positively correlated with the dose of amoxicillin, the frequency of administration, and the duration of treatment. A course of ⩾10 days, a daily dosage of > 3 g/days, and a dosing frequency of ⩾3 times daily may be necessary for achieving a satisfactory eradication rate of over 90%. Several studies compared VA dual therapy with standard triple therapy, or bismuth-containing quadruple therapyand demonstrated the noninferiority and safety for the former. However, there have been few studies investigating the effect of VA dual therapy on antibiotic-resistant H. pylori strains so far. Only one study from Japanreported that VA dual therapy was superior to VA-clarithromycin triple therapy in clarithromycin-resistant strains.

Clarithromycin is a critical drug for the treatment of H. pylori worldwide; however, its primary resistance rate has significantly increased, ranging from 17.2% to 19.7% or even reaching 27.2%, which has led to a decline in H. pylori eradication rates. The classification of clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori as a high-priority pathogen by the WHOunderscores the global urgency for efficient eradication strategies. Current guidelines recommend that PPI-clarithromycin-based triple regimens should only be used in patients without prior macrolide use who live in regions where the prevalence of clarithromycin resistance is known to be less than 15%. In areas where the resistance rate is unknown or exceeds 15%, most guidelines recommend first-line treatment options such as BQT for 10–14 days, typically consisting of PPI, bismuth, and dual antibiotics. Alternatively, non-bismuth concomitant quadruple therapy for 10–14 days, comprising a PPI, amoxicillin, clarithromycin, and a nitroimidazole administered concurrently, is recommended if bismuth is unavailable.– Furthermore, in clinical settings where bismuth, tetracycline, or Pylera ® (a single-capsule formulation containing bismuth subcitrate potassium, metronidazole, and tetracycline) is not readily available, rifabutin-based triple therapy or high-dose dual therapy represents viable empirical alternatives to BQT. Notably, P-CAB-based regimens may provide an effective alternative to PPI-based therapy. Many guidelines now recommend P-CAB-antimicrobial combination treatments for first-line and second-line treatment, especially for patients with evidence of antimicrobial-resistant infections. In Japan, even among patients with clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori, using VPZ in combination with amoxicillin and clarithromycin or metronidazole for 7 days as a first-line treatment has yielded favorable results.– A similar trend was observed in a multicenter RCT conducted by Chey in the United States and Europe. The study demonstrated enhanced effectiveness of both VPZ triple and dual therapies over PPI-based triple therapy in eliminating clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori, with eradication rates of 65.8% and 69.6% compared to 31.9%, respectively. Our meta-analysis corroborates these findings, indicating a substantial difference in eradication success between the two approaches against clarithromycin-resistant strains, with pooled eradication rates of 73.7% versus 41.5% (RR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.07–2.20, p = 0.02).

### Vonoprazan fumarate and amoxicillin (Voquezna DUAL PAK) [^111uU83q]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The effectiveness and safety of VOQUEZNA TRIPLE PAK and VOQUEZNA DUAL PAK were evaluated in a randomized, controlled, double-blind triple therapy/open-label dual therapy study conducted in the United States and Europe in treatment-naïve H. pylori -positive adult patients with at least one clinical condition: dyspepsia lasting at least 2 weeks, functional dyspepsia, recent/new diagnosis of peptic ulcer, peptic ulcer not treated for H. pylori infection, or a stable dose of long-term NSAID treatment (NCT04167670). Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to vonoprazan 20 mg twice daily plus amoxicillin 1,000 mg twice daily plus clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily (VOQUEZNA TRIPLE PAK) or vonoprazan 20 mg twice daily plus amoxicillin 1,000 mg three times daily (VOQUEZNA DUAL PAK) or lansoprazole 30 mg twice daily plus amoxicillin 1,000 mg twice daily plus clarithromycin 500 mg twice daily (LAC) administered for 14 consecutive days.

H. pylori infection at baseline was defined as positive by13C urea breath test (UBT) and follow-up upper endoscopy (culture or histology). H. pylori eradication was confirmed with a negative13C UBT test-of-cure at ≥ 27 days post-therapy. Patients with negative test results were considered treatment successes. Patients who tested positive for H. pylori infection and patients with missing results from the test-of-cure visit were considered treatment failures.

VOQUEZNA TRIPLE PAK and VOQUEZNA DUAL PAK were shown to be noninferior to LAC in patients who did not have a clarithromycin or amoxicillin resistant strain of H. pylori at baseline. VOQUEZNA TRIPLE PAK and VOQUEZNA DUAL PAK were shown to be superior to LAC in patients who had a clarithromycin resistant strain of H. pylori at baseline and in the overall population.

H. pylori eradication rates are shown in Table 10 for VOQUEZNA TRIPLE PAK and VOQUEZNA DUAL PAK compared to LAC.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of vonoprazan versus esomeprazole-based high-dose dual therapies for first-lineeradication: a randomized controlled trial [^1124fWih]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Effective Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication depends on maintaining intragastric pH > 6 and overcoming antibiotic resistance. High-dose dual therapy (HDDT) with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and amoxicillin has shown promising results.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy of 14-day vonoprazan-based (VA) and esomeprazole-based (EA) HDDT for H. pylori eradication and evaluate the impact of antibiotic resistance.

Design

Randomized controlled trial (RCT).

Methods

A total of 121 patients with confirmed H. pylori infection were randomized to receive either VA therapy (vonoprazan 20mg twice daily plus amoxicillin 750mg four times daily (QID)) or EA therapy (esomeprazole 40mg three times daily plus amoxicillin 750mg QID) for 14days. Eradication was assessed by the ¹³C-urea breath test at week 8. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed on cultured isolates.

Results

Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were comparable between the VA and EA groups. In the intention-to-treat analysis, eradication rates were 86.9% (95% confidence interval (CI): 78.4%-95.4%) in the VA group and 81.7% (95% CI: 71.3%-89.4%) in the EA group (p = 0.430). Per-protocol (PP) analysis showed eradication rates of 93.0% (95% CI: 86.4%-99.6%) for VA and 84.5% (95% CI: 73.8%-92.1%) for EA (p = 0.150), indicating no statistically significant difference. Adverse events (AEs) were mild and similar between groups (5.3% in VA vs 5.2% in EA, p = 0.983), with constipation and diarrhea being the most reported. Both groups achieved 100% compliance. Antibiotic resistance patterns did not significantly affect outcomes.

Conclusion

Both VA and EA-HDDT regimens demonstrated comparable efficacy, excellent compliance, and minimal AEs. Although VA therapy achieved a > 90% eradication rate in the PP analysis, our study was underpowered to confirm superiority. Therefore, larger, adequately powered RCTs are warranted to validate the potential superiority of VA.

### Ten-day vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy versus 14-day esomeprazole-amoxicillin dual therapy for first-lineeradication: a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial [^1169gdpR]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

There are several reasons why the 10-day VA dual therapy can achieve a high eradication rate as a first-line treatment. First, the resistance rate of H. pylori to amoxicillin is relatively low, with the latest research showing it to be around 3% in China, laying the foundation for the eradication of H. pylori with dual therapy. Second, amoxicillin has time-dependent characteristics and a short half-life. The effectiveness of its bactericidal action relies on the percentage of time that the blood plasma concentration exceeds the minimum inhibitory concentration. After 6–8 h of administration, a significant portion of amoxicillin is eliminated from the body. Therefore, giving amoxicillin every 6 or 8 h (either 3 or 4 times a day) is preferable for sustaining adequate blood drug concentrations over an extended period of time. In our study, the total daily dose of amoxicillin was 3000 mg. In the 10-day VA group, amoxicillin was administered three times a day (1000 mg each time, three times a day), which was less frequent compared to the classic regimen (750 mg each time, four times a day), making it more convenient and potentially improving patient compliance with medication. Third, sufficient acid suppression is a crucial factor in effectively eliminating H. pylori. When the stomach pH exceeds 6, H. pylori switches to a replicative state and becomes susceptible to amoxicillin, making it more vulnerable to eradication. Moreover, the bactericidal action of amoxicillin is influenced by stomach pH levels, with higher stomach pH levels providing greater stability for amoxicillin to work effectively. Vonoprazan inhibits H+, K+-ATPase competitively and reversibly, providing faster and more sustained acid suppression compared to esomeprazole 20 mg or rabeprazole 10 mg when administered at a dose of 20 mg. Prior studies have indicated that healthy participants in Japan who were given vonoprazan 20 mg twice daily had a gastric pH of ⩾4 and ⩾5 maintained for 100% and 99% of the time on the seventh day. In addition, unlike PPIs, vonoprazan is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, meaning it is not affected by variations between individuals related to CYP2C19 polymorphisms. As a result, it can effectively prevent differences in acid suppression effects caused by the CYP2C19 rapid metabolizer genotype. In summary, vonoprazan exhibits a stronger and more durable acid suppression effect than PPI, leading to a quicker induction of H. pylori replication. This also increases the sensitivity and antibacterial activity of amoxicillin, thereby improving the eradication efficacy of H. pylori.

### Seven-day vonoprazan and low-dose amoxicillin dual therapy as first-linetreatment: a multicentre randomised trial in Japan [^111wFnEa]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

This study design has several advantages: first, the study was a randomised controlled trial corrected from multiple centres; and second, the antibacterial susceptibility of H. pylori was confirmed in all enrolled patients and was used as stratification factor in randomisation. However, owing to the open-label nature of the study design, the lack of blinding may have influenced the reporting of side effects. In addition, only Japanese patients enrolled in this study; as vonoprazan has been introduced recently outside of Japan, studies with a double-blind design should also be performed in other countries.

In conclusion, the 7-day vonoprazan and low-dose AMO dual therapy provided acceptable H. pylori eradication rates and was similar to the effect of vonoprazan-based triple therapy as a first-line H. pylori eradication therapy in a country with high resistance to CLA. The VA-dual therapy has advantages, including single antibiotic and low antibiotic consumption; however, there is also the potential to improve its eradication effect through adjustments in the administration of AMO. Thus, further studies should be demanded to develop VA-dual therapy with proper adjustments and to establish new first-line H. pylori eradication treatments in the era of growing antimicrobial resistance.

Sample size calculation and statistical analysis

The sample size was estimated as follows: According to previous studies, we assumed that eradication rates were 90% for both VA-dual and B-quadruple regimens; assuming a power of 80%, a 1-sided alpha of 0.025, and a noninferiority margin of −0.1 (−10%), at least 141 subjects in each group would be needed for the noninferiority analysis; assuming a 10% loss of follow-up, a total of 314 subjects (157 patients in each group) were planned for enrollment in this study.

Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software version 26.0 (SPSS). Categorical variables were displayed as frequencies and proportions (%), and continuous variables were presented as the mean and SD. Continuous variables were compared by the Student t test or 1-way analysis of variance. Categorical variables were compared using the χ2 test. Comparative noninferiority of the 2 groups was assessed through hypothesis testing (1-sided test) and derivation of a 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI). A P value of < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.

Assessment of treatment outcomes

The primary outcome of this study was the H. pylori eradication rate, evaluated using the 13 C-UBT 8 weeks after treatment completion. Secondary outcomes included the incidence and severity of treatment-related adverse events (AEs) and patient drug compliance. Compliance: Assessed on Day 15 by checking the remaining medications. Patients who took < 80% of prescribed medications were classified as having poor compliance. Eradication success: Defined by a negative ¹³C-UBT result performed 8 weeks after treatment completion. AEs: Patients reported side effects during therapy, categorized using a 4-point severity scale: None, Mild (discomfort but no impact on daily activities), Moderate (discomfort affecting daily life), and Severe (requiring discontinuation of therapy).

Antibiotic susceptibility testing

Cultured H. pylori isolates were stored at −80°C in Brucella broth with 20% glycerol. MICs for amoxicillin, clarithromycin, levofloxacin, tetracycline, and metronidazole were determined using the agar dilution method and E-test (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden).EUCAST breakpoints defined antibiotic resistance as follows: Amoxicillin: MIC ⩾0.125 mg/L; Clarithromycin: MIC ⩾0.5 mg/L; Levofloxacin: MIC ⩾1 mg/L; Tetracycline: MIC ⩾1 mg/L; Metronidazole: MIC ⩾8 mg/L.

Block randomization

Eligible patients were enrolled from the outpatient department according to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. All patient details were fully de-identified prior to analysis and reporting. Randomization was performed using block randomization with a fixed block size of 4, with each block containing two allocations to the vonoprazan-based group (VA) and two to the esomeprazole-based group (EA). Patients were assigned a sequential study number upon enrollment; those receiving code A were allocated to the VA group, and those with code B to the EA group, ensuring a 1:1 allocation ratio. To maintain allocation concealment, the randomization sequence was pre-generated and implemented using sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes prepared in advance by an independent coordinator not involved in patient enrollment or treatment.

Blinding

This was an open-label study. Neither participants nor care providers were blinded to treatment allocation due to the nature of the interventions, which differed in drug type and dosing schedule. Outcome assessors and data analysts were also not blinded.

### The efficacy and safety of vonoprazan and tegoprazan ineradication: a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^111PGXP3]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Current international guidelines and consensus statements consistently recommend BQT as the preferred first-line treatment for H. pylori infection.– Recent meta-analyses have provided compelling evidence supporting alternative treatment approaches. Zhou et al.demonstrated that VPZ-amoxicillin dual therapy achieves comparable eradication rates to BQT while exhibiting a superior safety profile and equivalent compliance. Furthermore, a network meta-analysis by Ouyang et al.revealed that VPZ-based regimens, including high-dose dual therapy, triple therapy, and quadruple therapy, achieved significantly higher eradication rates compared to traditional PPI-based combinations in ITT analyses. Our meta-analysis, incorporating 20 studies comparing P-CAB-based regimens with 14-day BQT, corroborates these findings. The results demonstrated significantly higher eradication rates with P-CAB-based regimens (ITT analysis: 87.0% vs 79.8%, RR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.04–1.12, p < 0.0001) and lower adverse event rates (19.5% vs 30.3%, RR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.52–0.84, p = 0.0006). The recently published ACG Guidelinesadvocate for optimized BQT as the first-line treatment in treatment-naïve patients, specifically recommending bismuth (300 mg four times daily), metronidazole (1.5–2 g daily in 3–4 doses), tetracycline (500 mg four times daily), and standard-dose PPI (twice daily) for 10–14 days, preferably the latter. However, further research is warranted to definitively establish whether P-CAB-based regimens demonstrate superior efficacy compared to optimized BQT.

Data extraction

Data extraction was independently performed by two researchers, T.J. and Li Zhong. Any discrepancies encountered during the process were resolved by consensus, with W.W. acting as the mediator. For each selected study, the extracted data included the first author's name, publication year, country, study design, participant demographics, diagnostic tests employed for H. pylori infection and its eradication, total sample size, therapeutic approaches, treatment duration, timing of post-treatment confirmation tests, eradication rates based on intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, and commonly reported adverse events.

Study quality assessment

To evaluate the reliability and risk of bias in each study, the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment tool was utilized. This appraisal was independently conducted by T.J. and Li Zhong, with any disagreements resolved through discussion. The assessment framework covered several aspects: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and staff, blinding in the evaluation of outcomes, completeness of outcome data, risk of selective outcome reporting, and other potential biases. Based on these criteria, studies were classified as "low", "high", or "uncertain" risk levels.

Outcomes and statistical analysis

The primary outcome of the study was the eradication rate by ITT analysis. The secondary outcomes were adverse events. First, we screened studies that compared the P-CAB-based regimens with the 14-day BQT and performed a comparative analysis. Second, to enhance the clinical applicability of our findings, we further conducted comparative analyses between P-CAB-based regimens and all PPI-based regimens.

Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata 15.0 version (Stata Corp, College Station, Texas, USA) and Review Manager 5.4 version (Cochrane Collaboration, Oxford, UK), with p values less than 0.05 considered statistically significant. The comparative efficacy between P-CAB-based and PPI-based treatments was evaluated through risk ratios (RRs) alongside their 95% CI. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the χ² test (with p < 0.05 denoting significant heterogeneity) and the I² test (I² > 50% reflecting significant heterogeneity). For outcomes demonstrating low heterogeneity, a fixed-effect model was employed, whereas a random-effect model was utilized for outcomes with substantial heterogeneity. Sensitivity analyses were performed by sequentially omitting individual studies to evaluate result reliability. The potential for publication bias was explored through the visual inspection of funnel plots and Egger's test.

### Real-world outcomes associated with vonoprazan-basedproton pump inhibitor-based therapy forinfection in Japan [^111D1KTN]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

The 2016 Japanese guidelines for the treatment of H. pylori infection recommended a 7-day triple combination of vonoprazan or a PPI with amoxicillin and clarithromycin as first-line treatment. For patients infected with known clarithromycin-resistant strains of H. pylori, metronidazole is recommended in place of clarithromycin. For patients who are truly penicillin-allergic, sitafloxacin or clarithromycin with metronidazole may be used in place of amoxicillin. However, national health insurance only covers vonoprazan or a PPI in combination with amoxicillin and clarithromycin for first-line treatment and replacement of clarithromycin with metronidazole for second-line treatment, although additional regimens may be covered under employer-based plans. Therefore, real-world treatment patterns in clinical practice may differ from guideline recommendations.

Real-world studies have been conducted in Japan to evaluate eradication rates and costs associated with vonoprazan and/or PPIs. In one claims-based study, patients treated first line with vonoprazan had significantly higher eradication rates than those treated with a PPI (93.6% versus 79.7%; p < 0.001), resulting in lower total treatment costs [12,952 versus 13,146 Japanese yen (JPY)]. However, there is little data describing and comparing healthcare resource use (HCRU) and treatment patterns between patients treated with a vonoprazan-based or a PPI-based regimen. In addition, the comparative economic impacts of these two approaches have not been well characterized in a routine clinical setting. Therefore, this study was conducted to compare patients treated for H. pylori infection in Japan with a vonoprazan-based or a PPI-based regimen in terms of their characteristics, HCRU, healthcare costs, clinical outcomes and treatment patterns.

Vonoprazan

Vonoprazan, a new type of oral acid inhibitor, is an extraordinarily promising drug that was approved for use in Japan in 2015. It is a reversible H + -K + ATPase inhibitor with faster, stronger, and longer-lasting acid inhibitory effects than PPIs. – Most studies on vonoprazan were focused on triple therapy, and most were carried out in Japan. Recently, there have been some studies of vonoprazan-based dual treatment. In order to make better use of vonoprazan, trials need to be conducted outside East Asia and compared with PPIs in different regimens (such as CT, ST, and bismuth-containing therapy).

A meta-analysis that included only RCTs showed that triple therapy using vonoprazan as an alternative to PPI had a significantly higher eradication rate (91.4% versus 74.8%) and fewer adverse reactions (32.7% versus 40.5%). A large RCT in Japan compared the efficacy and safety between vonoprazan plus low-dose amoxicillin and vonoprazan triple therapy, and reported eradication rates of 84.5% and 89.2%, respectively, in ITT analysis, and 87.1% and 90.2%, respectively, in PP analysis. The regimen of vonoprazan plus low-dose amoxicillin achieved an eradication rate between 80% and 90%, which may be related to the fact that the course of treatment of the regimen lasted only 7 days and the dose of amoxicillin, and further trials are needed to determine a more appropriate course and dose. Clarithromycin may have no additional effect in first-line treatment when using vonoprazan. No significant difference was observed in the eradication rate between vonoprazan and vonoprazan plus clarithromycin regimens (85–90%) or between clarithromycin-resistant and -sensitive strains (ITT, 85% versus 87.6%; p = 0.7272). – The use of vonoprazan can increase the eradication rate of HP, but this effect is more obvious in young people; the eradication rate in elderly patients is significantly lower than that in young patients; the efficacy and safety in children are not clear.

### Treatment of Helicobacter pylori [^1154z6mc]. Current Opinion in Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Helicobacter pylori eradication has become more challenging over the past decade due to increasing antimicrobial resistance, especially to clarithromycin and levofloxacin. We identified 508 recent publications on H. pylori treatment (published between January 2018 and June 2019), focusing on the most highly clinically relevant for this review.

Recent Findings

Declining H. pylori eradication rates with clarithromycin triple therapy have led to most guidelines recommending 14 days bismuth-based quadruple therapy or concomitant therapy as the best initial empiric regimen. Substituting amoxicillin for tetracycline or metronidazole in quadruple therapy, and a three-in-one pill version of the regimen, also appear effective. Vonoprazan, a potent acid inhibitor, can overcome much clarithromycin resistance in triple therapy. High-dose dual therapy (proton pump inhibitor with amoxicillin) is a promising alternative approach. Reviewing resistance patterns to select suitable first-line empiric therapies is important in high resistance regions. Molecular methods to evaluate H. pylori antimicrobial susceptibility promise to be simpler than standard microbiological culture. The cost-effectiveness of antimicrobial susceptibility testing in refractory cases remains unproven.

Summary

Updating clinicians treating H. pylori is important to combat the emerging problems of multidrug antimicrobial resistance in H. pylori strains. Truly novel approaches to H. pylori eradication are needed.

### Fourteen-day vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy versus 14-day bismuth-based quadruple therapy fortreatment: a randomized clinical trial [^1169Szy3]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

In recent years, 14-day dual therapy consisting of a double-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and high-dose, high-frequency amoxicillin (⩾3 g, administered 3–4 times daily) has garnered considerable attention. – This approach leverages the low resistance rate of amoxicillin and the enhanced antimicrobial activity achieved through elevated intragastric pH levels maintained by the double-dose PPI. In Asian populations undergoing initial treatment, this regimen has demonstrated eradication rates exceeding 90%. – However, evidence from Western populations indicates eradication rates below 80%, – highlighting a potential regional disparity. This discrepancy is likely due to the short half-life of PPIs (0.5–2 h) and their metabolism being significantly influenced by CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms. Western populations predominantly comprise rapid or ultra-rapid metabolizers, for whom double-dose PPIs may fail to sustain the optimal intragastric pH required for effective H. pylori eradication.

Vonoprazan (VPZ), a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB), presents an alternative to PPIs with a longer half-life (5.1–9.0 h), faster onset of action, stronger and more sustained acid suppression, and independence from dietary factors or CYP2C19 polymorphisms. These pharmacokinetic advantages position VPZ as a promising candidate for improving eradication outcomes. Despite its potential, current studies on VPZ-amoxicillin (VA) dual therapy are limited, reporting eradication rates ranging from 66.7% to 87.1%. Given these variable results, further investigation into the efficacy of the VA dual regimen is warranted. This study, therefore, aims to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and patient compliance of a 14-day VA dual regimen in comparison with the standard 14-day BQT in treatment-naive H. pylori patients.

### The efficacy and safety of vonoprazan and tegoprazan ineradication: a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^112fzYd5]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB)-based therapies are emerging as promising alternatives for eradicating Helicobacter pylori infection. However, the comparative efficacy of P-CAB-based therapy versus proton-pump inhibitor (PPI)-based therapy in treating H. pylori infection remains uncertain.

Objectives

This meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of P-CAB-based therapies, including Vonoprazan (VPZ) and Tegoprazan (TPZ), compared to PPI-based therapies for H. pylori infection. Subgroup analysis assessed the influence of drug history, experimental drug, treatment duration, combination therapies, and geographic regions on treatment outcomes.

Design

Meta-analysis.

Data Sources and Methods

Comprehensive searches were conducted in major databases, including PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, up to January 1, 2024. The primary outcome was the eradication rate, analyzed by intention-to-treat (ITT). Secondary outcomes included adverse events. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed using the χ² test and the I² test. I² > 50% or p < 0.05 indicated significant heterogeneity.

Results

The analysis totally included 28 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comprising 37 studies and 8818 patients diagnosed with H. pylori infection. Of these, 14 RCTs, including 20 studies and 4286 patients, compared P-CAB-based therapy with 14-day bismuth-based quadruple therapy (BQT). P-CAB-based therapy exhibited superior eradication rates compared to both 14-day BQT and PPI-based therapy (ITT analysis: 87.0% vs 79.8%, risk ratio (RR) = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.04–1.12, p < 0.0001; and 85.6% vs 77.8%, RR = 1.09, 95% CI: 1.05–1.12, p < 0.00001, respectively). This enhanced efficacy was particularly pronounced in patients with clarithromycin-resistant infections (73.7% vs 41.5%, RR = 1.53, 95% CI: 1.07–2.20, p = 0.02). Subgroup analysis demonstrated higher eradication rates with P-CAB-based therapy in treatment-naïve participants, VPZ recipients, and those receiving 7- or 14-day regimens (dual, triple, or quadruple therapy). However, no significant differences were observed in treatment-experienced subgroups, TPZ recipients, or those on 10-day regimens. In addition, P-CAB-based therapy showed a lower incidence of adverse events than PPI-based treatments (RR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.63–0.86, p < 0.0001).

Conclusion

P-CAB-based therapies are more effective than traditional PPI-based treatments for eradicating H. pylori infection, with a reduced incidence of adverse events.

### Tegoprazan and low-or high-dose amoxicillin dual therapy versus bismuth-containing quadruple therapy foreradication (TREAT): protocol for a multicenter, open-label, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial [^112uwwgp]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Potent intragastric acid suppression is the key for H. pylori eradication because elevated gastric pH enhances replicated bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics and stabilizes acid-labile antibiotics (amoxicillin etc.). Potassium-competitive acid blockers (P-CABs), through reversible and selective inhibition of H + /K + -ATPase, show pharmacodynamic advantages than proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), including rapid onset, sustained suppression of gastric acids, and are not influenced by CYP2C19 polymorphism. P-CABs, represented by vonoprazan, have shown satisfactory efficacy in the eradication of H. pylori. Our previous systematic review and meta-analysis included 15 studies showing that the eradication rate of vonoprazan and amoxicillin dual therapy was 85.0% in intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis and 90.0% in per-protocol (PP) analysis. Tegoprazan, a novel P-CAB, demonstrates significantly faster absorption than vonoprazan – (the median T max of 0.5–1 h for tegoprazan and 1.5–4 h for vonoprazan) and achieves peak gastric pH elevation within 1 h post-dose. However, the shorter elimination half-life of tegoprazan, (3.87–4.57 h vs 9 h for vonoprazan) and lower p K a, (5.1 vs 9.3) limit its ability to sustain pH > 6.0 beyond 12 h, which is critical for the efficacy of amoxicillin. Thus, while the rapid acid suppression of tegoprazan is advantageous, its pharmacokinetic profile necessitates optimized dosing strategies. Notably, while TPZ-based regimens have demonstrated preliminary efficacy, – no multicenter trial has evaluated whether increasing dosing frequency (e.g. three times daily) can compensate for the abbreviated duration of acid suppression by tegoprazan and directly compared the efﬁcacy of tegoprazan with low-dose amoxicillin and high-dose amoxicillin dual therapy for eradicating H. pylori.

Introduction

Whether 10-day short-course vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy (VA-dual) is noninferior to the standard 14-day bismuth-based quadruple therapy (B-quadruple) against Helicobacter pylori eradication has not been determined. This trial aimed to compare the eradication rate, adverse events, and compliance of 10-day VA-dual regimen with standard 14-day B-quadruple regimen as first-line H. pylori treatment.

Methods

This prospective randomized clinical trial was performed at 3 institutions in eastern China. A total of 314 treatment-naive, H. pylori -infected patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either 10-day VA-dual group or 14-day B-quadruple group. Eradication success was determined by 13 C-urea breath test at least 4 weeks after treatment. Eradication rates, adverse events, and compliance were compared between groups.

Results

Eradication rates of VA-dual and B-quadruple groups were 86.0% and 89.2% (P = 0.389), respectively, by intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis; 88.2% and 91.5% (P = 0.338), respectively, by modified ITT analysis; and 90.8% and 91.3% (P = 0.884), respectively, by per-protocol (PP) analysis. The efficacy of the VA-dual remained noninferior to B-quadruple therapy in all ITT, modified ITT, and PP analyses. The incidence of adverse events in the VA-dual group was significantly lower compared with that in the B-quadruple group (P < 0.001). Poor compliance contributed to eradication failure in the VA-dual group (P < 0.001), while not in the B-quadruple group (P = 0.110).

Discussion

The 10-day VA-dual therapy provided satisfactory eradication rates of > 90% (PP analysis) and lower rates of adverse events compared with standard 14-day B-quadruple therapy as first-line H. pylori therapy.

INTRODUCTION

Helicobacter pylori is a widespread bacterium that typically infects the human gastric mucosa. H. pylori infection is universally acknowledged as a main risk factor of numerous gastrointestinal diseases, including gastritis, peptic ulcers, gastric carcinoma, and gastric lymphoma. Affecting approximately 50% of the global population, H. pylori infection has been a worldwide threat to human health.

Strategy of H. pylori screening and eradication in asymptomatic individuals is a cost-effective way to prevent gastric cancer. And nowadays, H. pylori eradication therapies are facing challenges with decreasing eradication rates, which mainly attribute to antimicrobial resistance such as clarithromycin, and are partially influenced by the efficacy of acid-suppressive drugs. Till now, international guidelines and consensus conferences still recommend bismuth-based quadruple (B-quadruple) therapies as first-line therapy for H. pylori infection in high clarithromycin resistance (resistance rate > 15%) areas. First-line B-quadruple therapies contain 2 types of antibiotics, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and bismuth, to overcome antimicrobial resistance and have reached an eradication rate approximately 90%. Despite improvement in the eradication rate, long-lasting B-quadruple regimens are restricted in clinical generalization owing to availability of conventional antibiotics (such as tetracycline and furazolidone) and bismuth and increasing side effects, poor compliance, and heavy cost. In addition, multiple antibiotics application could induce perturbation of fecal microbiota diversity and increase secondary antibiotic resistance (for instance, clarithromycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole), which would limit the choice of rescue regimen in patients with a failure of first-line eradication. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore novel regimens applying minimal antibiotics with shorter treatment duration while achieving satisfied H. pylori eradication rates.

### Randomized controlled study on the effects of triple therapy including vonoprazan or rabeprazole for the second-line treatment ofinfection [^115TBCJA]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background and Aim

Inhibition of gastric acid secretion is important for eradicating Helicobacter pylori. Vonoprazan (VPZ) is a strong, long-lasting inhibitor of gastric acid secretion. Studies that examined the effectiveness of VPZ-based triple therapy in second-line treatment have been performed. However, there have been no randomized controlled studies to compare the effect between VPZ-based triple therapy and proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-based triple therapy in second-line treatment, and it is not known which is more effective between VPZ-based and PPI-based therapies. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of second-line triple therapies including VPZ or rabeprazole (RPZ) as the PPI.

Methods

Eligible patients with H. pylori infection who failed first-line triple therapy were assigned randomly to the VPZ [VPZ40mg/day, amoxicillin (AMPC) 1500mg/day, metronidazole (MNZ) 500mg/day] or RPZ (RPZ20mg/day, AMPC1500mg/day, MNZ500mg/day) group. A 13 C-urea breath test result of less than 2.5% was considered as successful eradication.

Results

In total, 46 and 41 patients were analyzed as intention to treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP), respectively. Eradication rates in the VPZ and RPZ groups were 73.9% [95% confidence interval (CI) 51.6–89.8%] and 82.6% (95% CI 61.2–95.0%) based on ITT analysis, respectively (p = 0.72). Based on PP analysis, the eradication rates in the VPZ and RPZ groups were 89.5% (95% CI 66.9–98.7%) and 86.4% (95% CI 65.1–97.1%), respectively (p = 1.00). Two patients in the VPZ group and one in the RPZ group discontinued treatment due to side effects (p = 1.00).

Conclusion

There were no significant differences in efficacy and safety between second-line therapies including VPZ or RPZ.

### Updated joint ESPGHAN / NASPGHAN guidelines for management of Helicobacter pylori infection in children and adolescents (2023) [^114JQB3F]. Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori — management after eradication failure and acid suppression emphasizes that children who have persistent H. pylori infection after completing initial therapy should be treated again with an alternative regimen. Amoxicillin (AMO) should be given in three divided doses, and resistance to metronidazole (MET) can be overcome with a longer duration and higher dosage. Because inadequate acid suppression is associated with eradication failure, high doses, and more potent proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), if available, should be considered in cases of refractory H. pylori infection. After two failed therapies with confirmed patient adherence, H. pylori susceptibility testing should be reconsidered to guide the selection of subsequent regimens. As an alternative to PPIs-based therapies, potassium-competitive acid blockers (PCABs) show promise in adults; PCABs increase intragastric pH rapidly and potently and maintain it to a greater degree than PPIs, and in adults this property has been associated with higher H. pylori eradication rates. Studies also demonstrate in adolescents and preteens that PCABs, that is, Vonoprazan have minimal effect on the upper gastrointestinal tract microbiota, particularly the gastric microbiome, and a recent randomized clinical trial in over 1000 US and European adults demonstrated that PCAB-based triple therapy could be a suitable alternative to first-line CLA-based triple therapy or bismuth-based quadruple therapy. Well-designed studies of PCABs as part of H. pylori eradication therapy in children are awaited, and due to increasing antibiotic resistance, eradication of infection is met with increasing challenges and thus development of novel therapies is required; although there was great excitement from the initial studies identifying a potentially successful vaccine in children, there were no further studies on primary prevention in children during this review period.

### Update on the first-line treatment ofinfection in areas with high and low clarithromycin resistances [^115yhGE7]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Vonoprazan-based triple therapy

Vonoprazan is a novel first-in-class potassium-competitive potent acid blocker, which is a drug that inhibits H+, K+-adenosine triphosphate (ATPase) through reversible potassium-competitive ion binding, thereby inhibiting gastric acid secretion. The inhibitory effect (pKa 9.4) is largely unaffected by ambient pH and accumulates in parietal cells under both secretory and resting conditions. It has been used to treat H. pylori infection in Japan since February 2015. Vonoprazan is currently approved in Japan for first-line H. pylori eradication with clarithromycin-containing triple therapy and for second-line therapy with metronidazole and amoxicillin. The eradication rate of vonoprazan-based first-line triple therapy (combined with clarithromycin and amoxicillin) was reported to be 97.6% in patients with clarithromycin-susceptible H. pylori in a phase III study. A multicenter, prospective, randomized trial comparing the eradication rate between the 7-day vonoprazan-based triple therapy and 7-day PPI-based triple therapy in the clarithromycin-susceptible H. pylori -infected patients revealed 87.3% versus 76.5% in intention-to-treat and 88.9% versus 86.7% in per-protocol analyses. Another randomized clinical trial found that 7-day vonoprazan triple therapy was significantly more effective than 14-day omeprazole-based standard triple therapy for H. pylori infection. A meta-analysis of five Japanese studies including 1599 patients reported that vonoprazan-based and PPI-based standard triple therapies had comparable eradication rates for clarithromycin-susceptible H. pylori stains. However, the former was significantly more effective than the latter for clarithromycin-resistant strains (82% versus 40%). The overall data of recent randomized controlled trials, showed that the eradication rates of 7-day vonoprazan-based triple therapy for clarithromycin-susceptible and clarithromycin-resistant strains were 93.2% (164/176) and 79.5% (66/83), respectively. According to efficacy prediction model, the eradication rate of 7-day vonoprazan-based triple therapy is less than 90% when the frequency of clarithromycin-resistant strains is higher than 23% (Figure 2). However, data from studies conducted outside Japan are awaited to establish the global benefits of vonoprazan-based eradication therapies.

### AGA clinical practice update on the management of refractory Helicobacter pylori infection: expert review [^1114oSSU]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

AGA Clinical Practice Update — Best Practice Advice 8–11 for refractory H pylori infection state that longer treatment durations provide greater eradication success than shorter durations (eg, 14 days vs 7 days) and whenever possible longer durations should be selected. In some cases there should be shared decision making regarding ongoing attempts to eradicate H pylori, weighing benefits against adverse effects and inconvenience of repeated exposure to antibiotics and high-dose acid suppression. With confirmed patient adherence, H pylori susceptibility testing should be considered to guide selection of subsequent regimens. Compiling local data on eradication success rates for each regimen and relevant patient factors is important, and aggregated data should be made publicly available to guide local selection of therapy.

Regarding medical management for Helicobacter pylori infection, more specifically with respect to first-line regimens, ACG 2024 guidelines recommend to consider administering potassium-competitive acid blocker-clarithromycin triple therapy over PPI-clarithromycin triple therapy in treatment-naïve patients with H. pylori infection and unknown clarithromycin susceptibility:

- vonoprazan 20 mg BID

- clarithromycin 500 mg BID

### Efficacy of second-line regimens foreradication treatment: a systemic review and network meta-analysis [^111HoDAZ]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2020). High credibility.

There were several limitations in this NMA. First, we analysed the eradication therapies according to the prevalence of antibiotic resistance rate, clinical importance, and availability of antibiotics, and did not include vonoprazan-containing regimen. In H. pylori eradication therapy, increasing the intragastric pH > 5 could induce the bacteria to enter the replicative state and become more susceptible to both amoxicillin and clarithromycin. Recently, vonoprazan (TAK-438), a potassium-competitive acid blocker developed by Japan Takeda Pharmaceuticals, has become available. Vonoprazan has several advantages including faster onset, greater potency, stability under acidic environment, and is less influenced by CYP2C19 when compared with the standard dose of PPI, which might have a potential benefit in treating H. pylori. A meta-analysis of 14 studies with 14 636 Japanese participants concluded that vonoprazan-based TT was superior to standard TT in first-line therapy, but not in second-line treatments. Second, we did not analyse the optimal composition, dose, or duration of probiotics when used as an adjuvant therapy in the treatment of second-line H. pylori eradication therapy. Thus, further investigation is warranted. Third, for randomised trials, some concerns were common in overall bias because of inadequate concealment and blindness of participants in most trials. There was no significant inconsistency except when using the side-splitting method for the comparisons between BQT-7 and QTT-10/14. Finally, few trials reported zero events when considering the dropout rate, which contributed to less precise estimation of patients' adherence. However, a previous meta-analysis mostly described the tolerability of regimens narratively, and thus we adopted dropout rate due to loss of follow-up and adverse events during the follow-up period to address this issue objectively.

### Real-world outcomes associated with vonoprazan-basedproton pump inhibitor-based therapy forinfection in Japan [^116uafN8]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Vonoprazan-based therapy had lower total healthcare costs and HCRU than PPI-based therapy in the 12 months after treatment initiation. Based on prescription data for subsequent treatments, H. pylori eradication rates may have been higher with vonoprazan-based regimens, consistent with the results of comparative clinical trials from Japan and elsewhere in Asia. Future studies should explore the health consequences and direct and indirect costs of patients with H. pylori infection that was not eradicated by initial therapy.

### Efficacy of a 7-day vonoprazan, sitafloxacin, and amoxicillin triple therapy as a fourth-line salvage regimen for refractory Helicobacter pylori infection [^114UTg85]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Several regimens have been proposed for refractory H. pylori infection, including rifabutin-based triple therapy, high-dose dual therapy, and sitafloxacin-based triple therapy. The regimen combining vonoprazan, amoxicillin, and sitafloxacin (VAS regimen) leverages two mechanisms to enhance the efficacy of H. pylori eradication. Firstly, vonoprazan, a potassium-competitive acid blocker, exhibits advantages over traditional proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) given its potent acid suppression, rapid onset and prolonged stability in acidic environments. The potency of acid suppression is critical to maximize the efficacy and sustained activity of antibiotics and proliferation of H. pylori, which is crucial for the action of certain antimicrobial agents. Secondly, sitafloxacin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is infrequently used, providing a benefit for patients who failed to prior antibiotic exposure. Levofloxacin and sitafloxacin, categorized in quinolones group still demonstrated effective results in patients with prior exposure and failed to levofloxacin. Specifically, vonoprazan provides rapid and sustained acid suppression starting from the first dose, whereas conventional PPIs typically require 4–5 doses to achieve comparable acid inhibition. This early and potent acid suppression allows antibiotics to be effective from the beginning of therapy, supporting the use of a shorter treatment duration. In addition, two randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that the eradication efficacy of sitafloxacin-based triple therapy was not significantly different between 7- and 14-day regimens as well as between 7- and 10-day regimens. Meta-analysis indicated that VAS regimen achieves 87.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 73.3–94.7%) eradication rate as a third-line treatment. However, data on its efficacy as a fourth-line treatment are scarce.

This study aims to evaluate the efficacy of the empirical VAS as the fourth-line rescued regimen in patients who failed three prior standard eradication. Patient characteristics, including genotypic antibiotic resistance and drug metabolism polymorphisms were explored.

### Incidence and type of adverse events in patients taking vonoprazan: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^111fQ9JS]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Acid-suppressive agents are widely used for the management of various upper gastrointestinal diseases, such as peptic ulcer disease (PUD), gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection, artificial ulcers after gastric endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), and Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. Histamine-2 receptor antagonists, the first class of acid-suppressive agents, have limited efficacy and poor tolerance. Subsequently, in the late 1980s, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were introduced into our clinical practice, which strengthened the efficacy of management of gastric acid-related disorders. However, several gaps remained, such as insufficient inhibition of gastric acid, nocturnal acid breakthrough, poor compliance, slow onset of action, and drug efficacy by CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms. Vonoprazan, a new potassium-competitive acid blocker, has been approved for the management of acid-related diseases in Asia, South America, and some parts of North America. It acts on the key enzyme H + /K + -ATPase in the final step of gastric acid secretion by parietal cells, thereby hindering the exchange of H + and K + and inhibiting gastric acid secretion. Notably, vonoprazan has some advantages as compared to PPIs.– First, its activation is independent of acidic environment. Second, its onset of action is rapid, because its peak concentration can be reached quickly after 2 h of oral administration. Third, its efficacy is not affected by meals. Fourth, it can inhibit both activated and resting proton pumps in the gastric parietal cells, and the first dose can achieve the maximum acid-suppression and maintain its stability. Its plasma elimination half-life time is 5.7–8.8 h. Fifth, it is mainly metabolized by hepatic CYP3A4/5 enzyme, but not affected by CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms. Taken together, vonoprazan seems to exert more potent and prolonged acid-suppressing effects than PPIs. Current evidence has suggested that vonoprazan can be non-inferior to PPIs for the management of gastric acid-related disorders and more effective than PPIs for healing severe erosive esophagitis (EE) and eradicating H. pylori. – Several practice guidelines have also recommended vonoprazan as the first-line choice for the management of EE and H. pylori infection. However, until now, the safety of vonoprazan has not been systematically evaluated yet. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to elucidate the incidence and type of adverse events (AEs) in patients receiving vonoprazan, and to explore the risk factors affecting the safety of vonoprazan.

### Comparison of vonoprazan dual therapy, quadruple therapy and standard quadruple therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection in Hainan: a single-center, open-label, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial [^1136GXBz]. BMC Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Disscussion

The success rate of HP eradication regimens involving PPIs is continuously decreasing due to increased antibiotic resistance as well as their insufficient acid-suppressive effect. Therefore, it is difficult to improve the therapeutic efficacy of PPIs even when their dosage is increased. VPZ can effectively control the gastric PH above 4.0 most of the time with a dose of 20 mg twice daily, which can exhibit as strong and a long period acid-suppressing effect. we observed that patients with successful Hp eradication displayed a higher range of fluctuation in 24-hour gastric pH than those with failed eradication, and a higher pH has been reported to be beneficial for Hp eradication. Amoxicillin and clarithromycin, which are commonly used in Hp eradication, showed the best antibacterial effect at a pH of 6–7.

As indicated in Table 6, our results are similar to the recent findings of Lifen Lu et al. who reported that VPZ quadruple therapy, whether administered for 10 days or 14 days, can achieve eradication rates higher than 90% and was not inferior to standard PPI quadruple therapy. VPZ has been included as an acid-suppressing drug in first-line and second-line Hp eradication regimens and the secondary eradication rate was found to be above 90% in Japan. Interestingly, in a study by YI Hu and Wen Gao, the eradication rate of high-dose AMX in combination with VPZ was also observed to be above 85%, but some studies have shown that the eradication rate of VPZ dual therapy was not satisfactory. According to PP analysis, the VPZ dual therapy in this study demonstrated an acceptable eradication effect (eradication rate > 85%). Perhaps enhanced acid suppression and prolonged treatment duration are beneficial in improving the eradication rate of VPZ dual therapy[7，30–31]. Consider quadruple therapy if dual therapy is controversial.due to，In studies of VPZ quadruple therapy, Hp eradication rate mostly exceeded 90%. In addition to dual and quadruple therapies, the VPZ triple therapy in foreign studies also seems to have good eradication results, but prolonged treatment time does not show an advantage in triple therapy.

### Ten-day vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy vs standard 14-day bismuth-based quadruple therapy for first-line Helicobacter pylori eradication: a multicenter randomized clinical trial [^115BhEJm]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Treatment duration and antibiotics selection are of fierce debate among H. pylori experts. Recent studies have provided evidence of high-dose amoxicillin (3 g, administered 3 or 4 times/d)–based VA dual therapy in treatment optimization from traditional triple and quadruple regimen. A multicenter randomized clinical trial in China showed a satisfied eradication rate of 95.6% for 14-day VA dual therapy, confirming treatment potential for high-dose amoxicillin-based VA dual therapy as the first-line H. pylori treatment. However, according to current evidence, whether the duration could be shortened to 10 days was controversial. To provide higher level of evidence in standardizing and optimizing the regimen, we designed this randomized controlled trial to compare 10-day VA (with amoxicillin of 3 g, administered 3 times/d) with current first-line standard 14-day B-quadruple regimen. Delightfully, we proved an eradication rate of 10-day VA treatment up to 90% and less adverse events compared with standard 14-day B-quadruple regimen, providing strong evidence of shorter-course therapy as an alternative in Chinese population.

It is noteworthy that poor compliance (treatment duration < 8 days) was significantly associated with eradication failure in the VA-dual group, while not in the B-quadruple group, indicating a possible just right course for VA-dual of 10 days, but a redundant course for B-quadruple for 14 days. It is a reasonable speculation that eradication failure of B-quadruple owes to other reasons such as clarithromycin resistance, rather than poor compliance. Regardless, sticking to the prescription was essential to eradication success in VA-dual therapy.

Several limitations are inevitable when explaining the results of this study. First, antimicrobial susceptibility testing was not performed in this study. However, the resistance rate of amoxicillin is still rare in China, and absence of antimicrobial susceptibility testing is not unendurable for VA-dual regimen. On the contrary, even in regions with high clarithromycin resistance, clarithromycin-based B-quadruple therapy would also achieve high eradication rate of more than 90%, which weakens the influence of missing antimicrobial susceptibility testing in this study. Second, patients allergic to penicillin or regions with high amoxicillin resistance are not suitable for VA-dual and appropriate regimen without amoxicillin needs further exploration. Last, open label without blinding may have introduced treatment bias and may have affected the reporting of adverse events.

### Vonoprazan with amoxicillin or amoxicillin and clarithromycin for the treatment ofInfection [^115sUkyy]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2023). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To describe the pharmacology, efficacy, safety, and potential role of vonoprazan with amoxicillin or amoxicillin and clarithromycin for the treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in adults.

Data Sources

PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched using the terms: (vonoprazan OR voquezna) AND (" H. pylori " OR " Helicobacter pylori ") AND amoxicillin with no date limitations up to November 3, 2022.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Studies assessing the efficacy and safety of vonoprazan with amoxicillin and/or clarithromycin were included and divided into 3 groups based on different comparisons between treatment regimens used in each group.

Data Synthesis

Ten clinical trials and 17 observational studies were included. Vonoprazan-based therapy demonstrated greater acid inhibition and similar or higher efficacy than proton-pump inhibitor (PPI)-based therapy in treatment-naïve patients and with clarithromycin-resistant infections.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Proton-pump inhibitor-based therapies have not reached the desired successful eradication rate of 90% for H. pylori infection. Vonoprazan-based therapies being at least as effective as PPI-based therapies offer an alternative for patients with H. pylori infection.

Conclusion

Vonoprazan-based therapies were effective and well tolerated for the treatment of H. pylori infection in adults. These regimens provide an important alternative with prolonged acid inhibition, lower potential for CYP2C19 polymorphism, and at least comparable efficacy and safety versus PPI-based therapies in patients with H. pylori infections. Thus, vonoprazan-based therapy should be considered for certain patients, for example, those with failure to PPI-based treatments.

### Brief communication: global temporal trends in the efficacy of clarithromycin-based regimens for the treatment ofinfection [^113RYRzQ]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is the most common chronic bacterial infection, estimated to infect up to half of the world's population, ranging from 20% to 50% in industrialized countries and up to 80% in developing countries. Because of the established role of H. pylori in gastroduodenal disease, current clinical guidelines recommend eradication therapy for all patients diagnosed with active infection. Careful selection of first-line eradication therapy is important to guarantee high efficacy and limit the risk of antibiotic resistance.

Clarithromycin-based eradication therapies were successfully introduced in the 1990swhen their efficacy was at its peak and 7-day omeprazole–clarithromycin–amoxicillin treatment demonstrated an eradication rate of 94%. Up until around the 2000s, reported clarithromycin resistance rates in H. pylori were generally at or below 10%. However, between 2001 and 2014, clarithromycin resistance increased dramatically to over 20% in the United States, Europe, and Asia, with rates as high as 60% reported in some countries. In the United States, current resistance rates to clarithromycin, levofloxacin, and metronidazole are all above 30%. Infection with a clarithromycin-resistant strain of H. pylori has been associated with a sevenfold risk of treatment failure among patients who receive clarithromycin-containing regimens. Published literature suggests that eradication rates achieved with available regimens, particularly those containing clarithromycin, are declining; however, data regarding changes in the efficacy of clarithromycin-based eradication regimens over time are scarce.

Novel approaches are needed to mitigate the effects of antibiotic resistance and offer effective empiric eradication of H. pylori infection. Vonoprazan is a novel potassium-competitive acid blockerthat provides more potent and durable acid suppression than traditional proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Recent trial data suggest that substituting vonoprazan for PPI in clarithromycin-based triple regimens improves eradication rates. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of clarithromycin-based triple regimens, including vonoprazan-based triple therapy, over time.

### Cost-effectiveness of vonoprazan-based and rifabutin-based vs other regimens as first-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection in the United States [^111r4nbi]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The economic and clinical implications of eradicating Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) with vonoprazan-based and rifabutin-based regimens vs other existing prepackaged first-line treatment options in the United States are unknown. Therefore, we evaluated the cost-effectiveness of vonoprazan-based and rifabutin-based and other prepackaged regimens for the first-line treatment of H. pylori from the perspective of US healthcare payers.

Methods

We used the state-transition Markov model to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of H. pylori eradication with clarithromycin triple, bismuth quadruple, vonoprazan dual, vonoprazan triple, and rifabutin triple regimens. In a cycle length of 2 months, the model estimated the expected costs (expressed in 2022 US$), expected quality-adjusted life-years (QALY), incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, and expected net monetary benefit over 20 years. In addition, we accounted for the present value of future costs and QALY by applying a 3% discounting rate.

Results

In this study, rifabutin triple therapy had a lower expected cost but was more effective than clarithromycin triple, bismuth quadruple, and vonoprazan dual regimens; hence, it dominated them. Vonoprazan triple therapy had a higher expected cost (US$ 1,172 vs US$ 1,048) and expected QALY (14.262 vs 14.256) than rifabutin triple therapy, yielding an estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$ 22,573/QALY. The study suggested that vonoprazan triple treatment had the highest expected net monetary benefit and was the most cost-effective at willingness-to-pay thresholds between US$50,000 and US$150,000 per QALY, followed by rifabutin triple therapy.

Discussion

H. pylori infection eradication with vonoprazan triple therapy would provide the greatest net health and monetary benefit from the perspective of US healthcare payers.

### Update on the second-line treatment ofinfection: a narrative review [^1125kEax]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Second-line therapies for H. pylori infection

A standard bismuth quadruple therapy, a fluoroquinolone-containing quadruple (or triple) therapy or a PPI-amoxicillin high-dose dual therapy have been recommended as second-line treatment for H. pylori infection by the Maastricht VI/Florence Consensus Report. Recently, tetracycline-levofloxacin quadruple therapy and vonoprazan-based therapy have proposed to increase the eradication rate. Table 1 lists the regimens and durations of these recommended second-line therapies.

Table 1.
Regimens for second-line anti- H. pylori therapy.

To investigate the efficacies of current second-line eradication regimens, randomized controlled trials published in English language articles reporting the eradication rates of second-line anti- H. pylori therapy were eligible for literature search. The status of H. pylori infection before and after treatment should be verified by at least one of the following tests: urea breath test, rapid urease test, histology or culture. The post-treatment H. pylori status should be assessed at least 4 weeks after eradication therapies. Medical literatures were searched from PubMed (1 March 2013–1 March 2023). We identified the eligible literatures with the keywords of ' Helicobacter pylori ' or ' H. pylori ' or ' H pylori ', and 'therapy' or 'treatment'. 'Clinical trial' was set as filter. The titles and abstracts were screened by CAS and CBS to exclude irrelevant studies. The full articles of potentially eligible studies were further reviewed by CAS and CBS. Literatures published in the abstract form only were excluded. Studies that did not report the results according to the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were also excluded. Two investigators, CAS and CBS, reviewed the literatures under the above criteria independently using pre-designed data extraction form. Disagreements were resolved through discussion with PIH to reach consensus. Figure 1 shows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagram of the literature search. Table 2 summarizes the intention-to-treat and per-protocol eradication rates of various H. pylori eradication regimens including standard bismuth quadruple therapy (tetracycline-metronidazole quadruple therapy), fluoroquinolone-amoxicillin triple therapy, fluoroquinolone-amoxicillin quadruple therapy, tetracycline-fluoroquinolone quadruple therapy, high-dose dual therapy, levofloxacin-based sequential therapy, tetracycline-metronidazole-amoxicillin concomitant therapy, furazolidone-tetracycline quadruple therapy, furazolidone-amoxicillin quadruple therapy, amoxicillin-clarithromycin-metronidazole tetracycline quintuple therapy, and tetracycline-metronidazole-ofloxacin quintuple therapy.–

### Optimum duration of regimens for Helicobacter pylori eradication [^116VE7dV]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2013). Low credibility.

Background

The optimal duration for Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication therapy is controversial, with recommendations ranging from 7 to 14 days. Several systematic reviews have attempted to address this issue but have given conflicting results and limited their analysis to proton pump inhibitor (PPI), two antibiotics (PPI triple) therapy. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the optimal duration of multiple H. pylori eradication regimens.

Objectives

The primary objective was to assess the relative effectiveness of different durations (7, 10 or 14 days) of a variety of regimens for eradicating H. pylori. The primary outcome was H. pylori persistence. The secondary outcome was adverse events.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched up to December 2011 to identify eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We also searched the proceedings of six conferences from 1995 to 2011, dissertations and theses, and grey literature. There were no language restrictions applied to any search.

Selection Criteria

Only parallel group RCTs assessing the efficacy of one to two weeks duration of first line H. pylori eradication regimens in adults were eligible. Within each regimen, the same combinations of drugs at the same dose were compared over different durations. Studies with at least two arms comparing 7, 10, or 14 days were eligible. Enrolled participants needed to be diagnosed with at least one positive test for H. pylori on the basis of a rapid urease test (RUT), histology, culture, urea breath test (UBT), or a stool antigen test (HpSA) before treatment. Eligible trials needed to confirm eradication of H. pylori as their primary outcome at least 28 days after completion of eradication treatment. Trials using only serology or a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to determine H. pylori infection or eradication were excluded.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study eligibility and data extraction were performed by two independent review authors. Data analyses were performed within each type of intervention, for both primary and secondary outcomes. The relative risk (RR) and number needed to treat (NNT)/number needed to harm (NNTH) according to duration of therapy were calculated using the outcomes of H. pylori persistence and adverse events. A random-effects model was used. Subgroup analyses and sensitivity analyses were planned a priori.

Main Results

In total, 75 studies met the inclusion criteria. Eight types of regimens were reported with at least two comparative eligible durations. They included: PPI + two antibiotics triple therapy (n = 59), PPI bismuth-based quadruple therapy (n = 6), PPI + three antibiotics quadruple therapy (n = 1), PPI dual therapy (n = 2), histamine H2-receptor antagonist (H₂RA) bismuth quadruple therapy (n = 3), H₂RA bismuth-based triple therapy (n = 2), H₂RA + two antibiotics triple therapy (n = 3), and bismuth + two antibiotics triple therapy (n = 2). Some studies provided data for more than one regimen or more than two durations. For the PPI triple therapy, 59 studies with five regimens were reported: PPI + clarithromycin + amoxicillin (PCA); PPI + clarithromycin + a nitroimidazole (PCN); PPI + amoxicillin + nitroimidazole (PAN); PPI + amoxicillin + a quinolone (PAQ); and PPI + amoxicillin + a nitrofuran (PANi). Regardless of type and dose of antibiotics, increased duration of PPI triple therapy from 7 to 14 days significantly increased the H. pylori eradication rate (45 studies, 72.9% versus 81.9%), the RR for H. pylori persistence was 0.66 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.74), NNT was 11 (95% CI 9 to 14). Significant effects were seen in the subgroup of PCA (34 studies, RR 0.65, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.75; NNT 12, 95% CI 9 to 16); PAN (10 studies, RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.86; NNT = 11, 95% CI 8 to 25); and in PAQ (2 studies, RR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.83; NNT 3, 95% CI 2 to 10); but not in PCN triple therapy (4 studies, RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.07). Significantly increased eradication rates were also seen for PPI triple therapy with 10 versus 7 days (24 studies, 79.9% versus 75.7%; RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.89; NNT 21, 95% CI 15 to 38) and 14 versus 10 days (12 studies, 84.4% versus 78.5%; RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.90; NNT 17, 95% CI 11 to 46); especially in the subgroup of PAC for 10 versus 7 days (17 studies, RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.91) and for 14 versus 10 days (10 studies, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.91). A trend towards increased H. pylori eradication rates was seen with increased duration of PCN for 10 versus 7 days, and of PAN for 10 versus 7 days and 14 versus 10 days, though this was not statistical significant. The proportion of patients with adverse events, defined by authors, was marginally significantly increased only between 7 days and 14 days (15.5% versus 19.4%; RR 1.21, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.37; NNTH 31, 95% CI 18 to 104) but not for other duration comparisons. The proportion of patients discontinuing treatment due to adverse events was not significantly different between treatment durations. Only limited data were reported for different durations of regimens other than PPI triple therapy. No significant difference of the eradication rate was seen for all regimens according to different durations except for H₂RA bismuth quadruple therapy, where a significantly higher eradication rate was seen for 14 days versus 7 days, however only one study reported outcome data.

Authors' Conclusions

Increasing the duration of PPI-based triple therapy increases H. pylori eradication rates. For PCA, prolonging treatment duration from 7 to 10 or from 10 to 14 days is associated with a significantly higher eradication rate. The optimal duration of therapy for PCA and PAN is at least 14 days. More data are needed to confirm if there is any benefit of increasing the duration of therapy for PCN therapy. Information is limited for regimens other than PPI triple therapy; more studies are needed to draw meaningful conclusions for optimal duration of other H. pylori eradication regimens.

### Ten-day vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy as a first-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection compared with bismuth-containing quadruple therapy [^116Bi4Sx]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

No study has investigated the efficacy and safety of vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy compared with bismuth quadruple therapy (B-quadruple). This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 10-day vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy as a first-line treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection compared with B-quadruple and to explore the optimal dosage of amoxicillin in the dual therapy.

Methods

A total of 375 treatment-naive, H. pylori -infected subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio into 3 regimen groups including VHA-dual (vonoprazan 20 mg twice/day + amoxicillin 750 mg 4 times/day), VA-dual (vonoprazan 20 mg + amoxicillin 1,000 mg twice/day), and B-quadruple (esomeprazole 20 mg + bismuth 200 mg + amoxicillin 1,000 mg + clarithromycin 500 mg twice/day). Eradication rates, adverse events (AEs), and compliance were compared between 3 groups.

Results

The eradication rates of B-quadruple, VHA-dual, and VA-dual were 90.9%, 93.4%, and 85.1%, respectively, by per-protocol analysis; 89.4%, 92.7%, and 84.4%, respectively, by modified intention-to-treat analysis; 88.0%, 91.2%, and 82.4%, respectively, by intention-to-treat analysis. The efficacy of the VHA-dual group was not inferior to the B-quadruple group (P < 0.001), but VA-dual did not reach a noninferiority margin of -10%. The AEs rates of the B-quadruple group were significantly higher than those of the VHA-dual (P = 0.012) and VA-dual (P = 0.001) groups. There was no significant difference in medication compliance among 3 treatment groups (P = 0.995).

Conclusions

The 10-day VHA-dual therapy provided satisfactory eradication rates of > 90%, lower AEs rates, and similar adherence compared with B-quadruple therapy as a first-line therapy for H. pylori infection. However, the efficacy of VA-dual therapy was not acceptable.

### Vonoprazan-based triple and dual therapy versus bismuth-based quadruple therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection in China: a three-arm, randomised clinical trial protocol [^112FKHSF]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Helicobacter pylori infection and associated diseases are a growing global public health issue. H. pylori infection is the major cause of gastric cancer, over 90% of duodenal ulcers, and over 70% of gastric ulcers. The infection rate of H. pylori is approximately 50%, and approximately 50% of new cases of gastric cancer worldwide occur in China. Bismuth (BI)-based quadruple therapy is recommended as the first-line treatment for H. pylori in China. Vonoprazan (VPZ), a new potassium-competitive acid blocker that can inhibit gastric acid secretion more effectively than proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), has been combined with antibiotics to effectively eradicate H. pylori. In this study, we compared the efficacy and safety of two VPZ-based therapies with that of BI-based therapy for H. pylori treatment.

Methods

A three-armed randomised controlled trial (RCT) is being conducted in Shenzhen, with 327 participants recruited from the Gastroenterology Clinic of the University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen Hospital. Patients were diagnosed with H. pylori infection based on a positive ¹³C-urea breath test (UBT). Patients are kept naïve to their treatment and are randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to either VPZ-based triple, VPZ-based dual, or BI-based quadruple therapy for 14 days. All groups are subjected to follow-up evaluations of safety, adverse drug reactions, and clinical variables in the first, second, and fourth weeks after treatment. Successful eradication is confirmed by a negative ¹³C-UBT six weeks after treatment. If initial treatment fails, (1) those patients are turned to another regimen, or (2) a drug resistance test is conducted, after which an individualised treatment regimen shall be prescribed according to antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The resulting data will be evaluated using intention-treat and a per-protocol analysis.

Discussion

This study is the a RCT aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 14-day VPZ-based triple and dual therapies in comparison with BI-based quadruple therapy. The outcomes of this study may allow treatment recommendations and update drug instructions in China.

### ACG clinical guideline: treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection [^112ZAH3Y]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Helicobacter pylori treatment — dual therapy with a PCAB and amoxicillin is suggested as a first-line treatment option for treatment-naive infection (conditional recommendation; moderate quality evidence). Unlike most proton pump inhibitors, which should be taken 30–60 minutes before a meal for optimal effect, vonoprazan can be taken in the fed or fasted state, and two vonoprazan-based regimens were approved by the FDA in 2022 for the treatment of H. pylori infection in adults. One randomized controlled trial directly compared PCAB–amoxicillin dual therapy comprising vonoprazan 20 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1,000 mg 3 times daily with PPI–clarithromycin triple therapy comprising lansoprazole 30 mg, clarithromycin 500 mg, and amoxicillin 1,000 mg each given twice daily, with each regimen for 14 days. In subjects with clarithromycin-sensitive strains, the vonoprazan–amoxicillin dual regimen was noninferior to the lansoprazole–clarithromycin triple regimen, and trial demographics included almost 90% White participants, fewer than half enrolled in the United States, and a mean body mass index around 29 kg/m².

### Efficacy and safety of vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy forfirst-line treatment: a single-center, randomized, controlled trial [^116jXs4k]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

With the increase in antibiotic resistance, the success rate of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) eradication therapy has declined in recent years. Vonoprazan-amoxicillin (VA) dual therapy has been reported to be a promising regimen.

Objectives

To compare the efficacy and safety of VA dual therapy and bismuth quadruple therapy containing amoxicillin and clarithromycin for H. pylori first-line eradication, and to further analyze the effects of clarithromycin resistance on eradication rate.

Design

This study was a single-center, open-label, randomized controlled trial.

Methods

Treatment-naïve H. pylori -infected patients were randomly allocated 1:1 to the VA group (vonoprazan 20mg twice daily and amoxicillin 750mg four times daily, for 14days) or the RBAC group (rabeprazole 10mg, bismuth potassium citrate 220mg, amoxicillin 1000mg and clarithromycin 500mg twice daily, for 14days). H. pylori clarithromycin resistance and CYP2C19 gene polymorphisms were detected with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. The eradication rates and adverse events were analyzed.

Results

A total of 151 patients were enrolled. The intention-to-treat (ITT), modified intention-to-treat (mITT), and per-protocol (PP) eradication rates and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were 94.6% (86.0–98.3%), 98.6% (91.3–99.9%), and 98.5% (90.9–99.9%) for VA group and 87.0% (77.0–93.3%), 91.8% (82.3–96.6%), and 93% (83.7–97.4%) for RBAC group. The eradication rate of the VA group was noninferior to the RBAC group in ITT, mITT, and PP analyses (p < 0.0001). In patients infected with strains of clarithromycin resistance point mutation, the eradication rate of the RBAC group decreased to lower than 90%, but the difference from the VA group did not achieve statistical significance (ITT eradication rate: 81.5% in the RBAC group and 96.2% in the VA group, p = 0.192). The incidence of adverse events in the VA group was 39.2%, which was significantly lower than that in the RBAC group (79.2%, p = 0.000).

Conclusion

The efficacy of VA dual therapy is noninferior to RBAC in H. pylori first-line eradication, with fewer adverse reactions.

Registration

### Vonoprazan triple and dual therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection in the United States and Europe: randomized clinical trial [^11388iZv]. Gastroenterology (2022). Medium credibility.

Background & Aims

Novel, effective treatments for Helicobacter pylori infection are needed. This study evaluated the efficacy of vonoprazan, a potassium-competitive acid blocker, vs standard treatment on H pylori eradication in the United States and Europe.

Methods

In a randomized, controlled, phase 3 trial, treatment-naïve adults with H pylori infection were randomized 1:1:1 to open-label vonoprazan dual therapy (20 mg vonoprazan twice daily; 1 g amoxicillin 3 times daily), or double-blind triple therapy twice a day (vonoprazan 20 mg or lansoprazole 30 mg; amoxicillin 1 g; clarithromycin 500 mg) for 14 days. The primary outcome was noninferiority in eradication rates in patients without clarithromycin- and amoxicillin-resistant strains (noninferiority margin = 10%). Secondary outcomes assessed superiority in eradication rates in clarithromycin-resistant infections, and in all patients.

Results

A total of 1046 patients were randomized. Primary outcome eradication rates (nonresistant strains): vonoprazan triple therapy 84.7%, dual therapy 78.5%, vs lansoprazole triple therapy 78.8% (both noninferior; difference 5.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.8 to 12.6; P < .001; difference -0.3%; 95% CI, -7.4 to 6.8; p = 0.007, respectively). Eradication rates in clarithromycin-resistant infections: vonoprazan triple therapy 65.8%, dual therapy 69.6%, vs lansoprazole triple therapy 31.9% (both superior; difference 33.9%; 95% CI, 17.7–48.1; P < .001; difference 37.7%; 95% CI, 20.5–52.6; P < .001, respectively). In all patients, vonoprazan triple and dual therapy were superior to lansoprazole triple therapy (80.8% and 77.2%, respectively, vs 68.5%, difference 12.3%; 95% CI, 5.7–18.8; P < .001; difference 8.7%; 95% CI, 1.9–15.4; p = 0.013). Overall frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events was similar between vonoprazan and lansoprazole regimens (P > .05).

Conclusion

Both vonoprazan-based regimens were superior to proton pump inhibitor-based triple therapy in clarithromycin-resistant strains and in the overall study population.

### Ten-day vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy versus 14-day esomeprazole-amoxicillin dual therapy for first-lineeradication: a prospective multicenter randomized controlled trial [^113gCVL8]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Medium credibility.

Table 2.
Helicobacter pylori eradication rates of each group.

When comparing the eradication rates between the 10-day VA group and the 14-day EA group in the non-inferiority test, the differences in eradication rates between the two groups were 8.69% (95% CI: 2.28%–15.09%) in the ITT analysis, 5.98% (95% CI: 0.38%–11.57%) in the MITT analysis, and 5.59% (95% CI: 0.04%–11.15%) in the PP analysis. The lower bounds of the 95% CI for the eradication rates in all three analyses were higher than the pre-specified non-inferiority margin (−10%), and the non-inferiority p -values in all three analyses were less than 0.001, indicating that the eradication rate in the 10-day VA group was not inferior to that in the 14-day EA group. Furthermore, in the ITT, MITT, and PP analyses, the 95% CI for the difference in eradication rates fell completely on the right side of the value 0, and the p -values for the differences were all < 0.05, suggesting that the eradication rate in the 10-day VA group was superior to that in the 14-day EA group.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of vonoprazan versus esomeprazole-based high-dose dual therapies for first-lineeradication: a randomized controlled trial [^116PS3ey]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is a major global health concern, affecting nearly half of the world's population and playing a critical role in the development of peptic ulcer disease, gastric adenocarcinoma, and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. Eradication of H. pylori is essential for preventing these severe complications and reducing the burden of gastric diseases. However, successful eradication has become increasingly challenging due to the rising prevalence of antibiotic resistance, particularly clarithromycin resistance, which has significantly reduced the efficacy of traditional triple therapy regimens. In regions where clarithromycin resistance exceeds 15%–20%, standard triple therapy often fails to achieve acceptable eradication rates, necessitating the development of alternative treatment strategies.

One promising strategy is high-dose dual therapy (HDDT), which consists of a high-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and high-dose amoxicillin. This regimen is designed to enhance amoxicillin's bactericidal activity by maintaining a consistently high intragastric pH, thereby reducing bacterial load and minimizing antibiotic resistance selection pressure. Notably, H. pylori rarely develops resistance to amoxicillin, making HDDT an attractive alternative to multidrug regimens. Studies have shown that maintaining an intragastric pH above 6 significantly improves amoxicillin's minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), optimizing its efficacy against H. pylori.

### Vonoprazan, a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker, as a component of first-line and second-line triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication: a phase III, randomised, double-blind study [^115eq86r]. Gut (2016). Low credibility.

Treatment

Subjects were randomised in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive first-line triple therapy with vonoprazan 20 mg or lansoprazole 30 mg in combination with AMX 750 mg plus CLR 200 or 400 mg. The four treatments were compared in the analyses as two treatment groups (the vonoprazan group vs the lansoprazole group), where subjects randomly allocated to either of the two approved doses of CLR (200 and 400 mg) available in Japan were combined, because the CLR dosage has been shown not to affect the H pylori eradication rate. Independent randomisation personnel generated the randomisation table and managed the randomisation process. A double-dummy method involving matched vonoprazan placebo tablets and lansoprazole placebo capsules was employed to ensure that the double-blind conditions were maintained in the study to avoid potential bias. The first 50 subjects who failed their allocated vonoprazan-based or lansoprazole-based first-line triple therapy but who also had good compliance received second-line triple therapy with vonoprazan 20 mg (in combination with AMX 750 mg and MTZ 250 mg) as an open-label treatment. All treatments were administered orally twice daily for 7 days and the subjects were then followed up for an additional ≥ 4 weeks and evaluated for H pylori status (figure 1).

### Real-world outcomes associated with vonoprazan-basedproton pump inhibitor-based therapy forinfection in Japan [^113oWKne]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a gram-negative bacterium that is classified by the World Health Organization as a Group 1 carcinogen. H. pylori causes chronic inflammation of the gastric mucosa, which, if left untreated, can persist and cause more serious conditions including peptic ulcer disease and gastric adenocarcinoma. H. pylori is estimated to be responsible for around 89% of non-cardia gastric cancers worldwide and more than 95% in Japan.

The estimated prevalence of H. pylori infection in Japan is less than 30%, and it is typically spread from family members to infants. While prevalence rates have been decreasing over the past few decades, H. pylori infection is highly correlated with the incidence of gastric cancer. Therefore, continued efforts to reduce the rates of infection are of utmost importance. In an attempt to facilitate the prevention of gastric cancer, Japanese health insurance coverage was approved for H. pylori eradication therapy in patients with gastric or duodenal ulcers in 2000. This coverage was subsequently expanded in 2013 to include all patients with H. pylori infection.

In Japan, current treatment options for H. pylori infection include either a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or vonoprazan, given in combination with two antibiotics. Vonoprazan is a potassium-competitive acid blocker that was approved in Japan in December 2014, with use in Japan starting in 2015. Vonoprazan was approved in 2022 for use in the United States and has shown efficacy over PPI-based therapy in other South Eastern Asian countries. – The PPIs that are available in Japan are omeprazole, lansoprazole, rabeprazole and esomeprazole. Rabeprazole and esomeprazole have been associated with slightly higher eradication rates in clinical trials (77–94%) than earlier PPIs such as omeprazole (75–88%). In contrast to PPIs, vonoprazan is acid-stable and does not require acid for activation, thus producing greater and longer lasting suppression of gastric acid secretion than PPIs. Accordingly, vonoprazan-based therapy has been shown to be superior to PPI-based therapy in both first- and second-line treatment of H. pylori infection, with eradication rates of over 90%. – Notably, vonoprazan-based therapy has demonstrated superior efficacy against clarithromycin-resistant H. pylori strains.

### Seven-day vonoprazan and low-dose amoxicillin dual therapy as first-linetreatment: a multicentre randomised trial in Japan [^11184PPg]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

A dual therapy consisting of PPI and AMO was first reported in the 1990s as a first-line treatment against H. pylori infection (table 4). The efficacy of a low-dose and/or less frequent dual therapy consisting of AMO (2.0 g/day or less) and PPI (twice/day or less) resulted in unacceptable eradication rates. Recently, high-dose and high-frequency dual therapy, defined as the administration of both AMO (≥ 2.0 g/day) and PPI (at least twice daily) for 14 days, has been reported to have greater H. pylori eradication efficacy as first-line therapy. However, side effects and poor patient compliance due to high dose, high administration frequency and long duration of treatment are the most common setbacks. Thus, the high-dose and high-frequency AMO–PPI dual therapy has been subsequently used as a rescue/salvage treatment. As the important factor to a successful dual therapy regimen is to maintain a near-neutral pH in the stomach to make H. pylori sensitive to AMO and vonoprazan has a stronger effect on acid secretion inhibition than other PPIs, it is expected to be more effective when used in combination with AMO for eradication of H. pylori. We demonstrated that VA-dual therapy achieved 87% of eradication rates in PP analysis and was non-inferior to VAC-triple therapy. However, the eradication effect of VA-dual did not achieve the clinically sufficient eradication rate of 90%. Further, the 10% non-inferiority margin, compared with 90% of eradication rate for VAC-triple therapy, may be clinically inappropriate because this setting means that the lower bound of the 95% CI of the VA-dual eradication rates could be 80%, which is also insufficient for H. pylori treatment in clinical practice. Another key parameter to the success of a dual therapy regimen is to maintain steady AMO plasma concentrations above the MIC level for its bactericidal effect against H. pylori. The results of a retrospective study in which dual therapy (vonoprazan 20 mg twice daily and AMO 500 mg three times daily for 7 days) provided an eradication rate of 93% as first-line treatmentsuggested that high administration frequency of AMO could improve the eradication rate in vonoprazan-based dual therapy to values similar to those of high-dose and high-frequency AMO–PPI dual therapy. Thus, further adjustments in the administration frequency and dose of AMO are necessary to improve the eradication effect of the VA-dual therapy.

### Vonoprazan, a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker, as a component of first-line and second-line triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication: a phase III, randomised, double-blind study [^11498eqM]. Gut (2016). Low credibility.

Given its stronger acid-inhibitory effects, vonoprazan is thus expected to be at least as effective as PPIs as part of H pylori eradication regimens. This study was therefore conducted to determine whether triple therapy with vonoprazan (in combination with AMX and CLR) was as effective as one of the approved first-line triple therapies (lansoprazole/AMX/CLR) for H pylori eradication.

Given the considerations mentioned above, we anticipate that the 10-day VA dual therapy may achieve the same eradication effect as the 14-day EA dual therapy. Therefore, to further optimize the current guidelines recommending 14-day high-dose PPI–amoxicillin dual therapy, we conducted a prospective multicenter RCT to directly compare the efficacy and safety of 10-day VA dual therapy (vonoprazan 20 mg bid + amoxicillin 1000 mg tid) versus 14-day EA dual therapy (esomeprazole 20 mg qid + amoxicillin 750 mg qid) in eradicating H. pylori, aiming to offer patients a highly efficient, convenient, and safe option.

Dual therapy consisting of double-dose PPI and high-dose amoxicillin (≥ 3 g, administered 3–4 times daily) is the simplest regimen recommended by current guidelines and is highly promising with a real-world eradication rate of up to 90% in Asian treatment-naive patients. Success of dual therapy was, first, based on the low resistance rate of amoxicillin and, second, due to increasing intragastric pH induced by double-dose PPI, which synchronizes and enhances the effects of amoxicillin in turn.

Vonoprazan, a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker providing a stronger and more sustained acid inhibitory effect than PPI, has shown immense potential to improve the H. pylori eradication rate. A pilot single-center study in China showed unsatisfactory eradication rate of 10-day vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy (VA-dual) therapy (81.1% by PP analysis). Subsequent trials demonstrated different results of comparable eradication rate of 14-day VA-dual regimen with standard 14-day B-quadruplet regimen and 10-day VA-dual regimen vs 10-day B-quadruplet regimen. High-quality evidence has not emerged regarding efficacy of 10-day VA-dual therapy compared with currently recommended first-line 14-day B-quadruple regimen.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the eradication rate, adverse events, and compliance of 10-day VA-dual regimen compared with standard 14-day B-quadruple therapy as first-line H. pylori treatment and to explore the factors associated with eradication failure.

### Vonoprazan-based therapy foreradication: experience and clinical evidence [^112rYG67]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Stable suppression of gastric acid secretion is a crucial factor in Helicobacter pylori eradication. Vonoprazan is a potassium-competitive acid blocker recently approved for use in Japan. As vonoprazan has a long duration of action and causes rapid and strong inhibition of gastric acid secretion, it has gained clinical attention for treating erosive oesophagitis, peptic ulcers, and H. pylori infection. In this review, we discuss the recent knowledge regarding the safety and efficacy of vonoprazan, focusing on its use in H. pylori eradication. The latest literature and our clinical experience have shown that vonoprazan-based therapies have satisfactory eradication rates. Additionally, vonoprazan-based therapies are associated with similar rates of adverse events as standard triple therapies with conventional proton-pump inhibitors.

Table 4
Studies of PPI and amoxicillin dual therapies as first-line Helicobacter pylori treatment

The results of the subgroup analysis by CLA susceptibility in this study were unexpected. The eradication rate of the CLA-resistant strain achieved with VA-dual therapy was significantly higher than that achieved with VAC-triple therapy. As the VA-dual therapy consists of fewer antibiotic agents than the VAC-triple therapy, it is unlikely that the eradication rate of VA-dual therapy is higher than that of VAC-triple therapy, regardless of the antimicrobial resistance of H. pylori. This difference in eradication of the CLA-resistant strain between the two treatment groups can be attributed to chance as the p value was borderline and the sample size was small. The AMO MIC cut-off value may also account for this difference. Although none of the patients was infected with an AMO-resistant strain, seven patients receiving VAC-triple therapy and two patients receiving VA -dual therapy had MIC of ≥ 0.03 µg/mL in group with patients with CLA-resistant strains. The subgroup analysis of eradication rates according to the MIC of AMO showed that the eradication rate for the VAC-triple therapy in the 0.06 of MIC group was lower than that in the ≤ 0.015 and 0.03 of MIC group. This disparity in the proportion of AMO MIC between the groups potentially affected the eradication rates and resulted in a lower eradication rate in the VAC-triple group. Another possible explanation for the CLA-resistant eradication difference observed between the VA-dual and VAC-triple therapies regards the pharmacokinetic interaction of vonoprazan and CLA. Because both vonoprazan and CLA are metabolised by the same hepatic enzyme (cytochrome P450 3A4), administering both drugs together increases the maximum plasma concentration and the area under the plasma concentration–time curve of vonoprazan by 1.5-fold to 1.9-fold in comparison with the administration of vonoprazan alone. Vonoprazan has a strong gastric acid inhibitory effect and the gastric pH level often exceeds 7 even when administered alone. Thus, when vonoprazan is administered with CLA, the maximum pH level may increase or the duration of this effect may be extended. H. pylori grows at a narrow external pH range between 6 and 7 and is sensitive to growth-dependent antibiotics including AMO. Previously, the optimal pH for H. pylori growth was studied in vitro and it was reported that the growth of this bacterium was poorer at pH 7.9 than at pH 7.2. Thus, the vonoprazan–CLA interaction might cause suboptimal gastric acid pH levels (ie, > 7), resulting in a decrease in the H. pylori sensitivity to AMO in the VAC-triple therapy.

Introduction

The prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection represents a significant public health challenge, affecting approximately half of the global population. This bacterium is associated with various gastrointestinal disorders, including chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and gastric cancer. Recognizing its deleterious impact, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified H. pylori as a Group 1 carcinogen in 1994. H. pylori infection stands out as a notable, modifiable risk factor for gastric cancer. Eradication of this pathogen can mitigate gastric inflammation, promote mucosal healing, resolve peptic ulcers, and reduce the risk of gastric cancer. – Consequently, H. pylori eradication has garnered widespread support from numerous international guidelines and consensus forums, – barring specific contraindications.

Currently, the most commonly used treatment options for H. pylori infection consist of two regimens. The first is bismuth-based quadruple therapy (BQT),– which incorporates a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI), bismuth, and two antibiotics administered over a 10- to 14-day period. The second approach involves a triple therapy regimen combining a PPI with clarithromycin and either amoxicillin or metronidazole, typically administered for 14 days.– Notably, Japan diverges from this approach, advocating a 7-day triple therapy regimen as the first-line treatment. However, the efficacy of PPI-based regimens has gradually diminished owing to widespread antibiotic resistanceand insufficient acid suppression. Rokkas et al. highlighted that many PPI-centered strategies fail to achieve the desired 90% eradication benchmark. The short elimination half-lives of PPIs, their inadequate acid suppression, and pharmacokinetic variations across ethnicities may compromise their global efficacy in H. pylori management. These challenges have catalyzed the pursuit of more effective and innovative solutions for addressing H. pylori infections. According to the recently published ACG guideline, for treatment-naïve patients with H. pylori infection and unknown antibiotic susceptibility profiles, 14-day BQT with optimized dosing is recommended as the preferred first-line treatment. Alternative empiric therapies include 14-day rifabutin triple therapy or potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB) dual therapy. In addition, in patients with no history of macrolide exposure or penicillin allergy and unknown antibiotic susceptibility, 14-day P-CAB-clarithromycin triple therapy is preferred over PPI-clarithromycin triple therapy when other first-line treatment options are not feasible.

Randomization and treatment

Participants were randomly assigned to receive 10-day vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy or 14-day bismuth-based quadruple therapy in a 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated random allocation sequence. The sequence was concealed for all investigators. Patients and investigators were not blinded to allocation of treatment group.

The vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual regimen consisted of 20 mg of vonoprazan (Takeda Pharmaceutical, Tianjin, China) twice daily and 1 g of amoxicillin 3 times daily for 10 days. Vonoprazan was administered 30 minutes before breakfast and supper, and amoxicillin was administered 30 minutes after 3 meals. The bismuth-based quadruple regimen consisted of 10 mg of rabeprazole, 1 g of amoxicillin, 500 mg of clarithromycin, and 200 mg of colloidal bismuth twice daily for 14 days. Rabeprazole and colloidal bismuth were administered 30 minutes before breakfast and supper, and amoxicillin and clarithromycin were administered 30 minutes after breakfast and supper.

### Efficacy and safety of vonoprazan-amoxicillin dual therapy forfirst-line treatment: a single-center, randomized, controlled trial [^113PtnT3]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Since the primary resistance and acquired resistance of H. pylori to amoxicillin are both rare, there has been a constant interest in proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and amoxicillin dual therapy. Recently, high-dose PPI (3–4 times/day) plus amoxicillin (3000 mg/day) dual therapy (HDDT) for 14 days was reported to be not inferior to bismuth quadruple therapy containing amoxicillin and clarithromycin in initial H. pylori eradication. In this regimen, the enhanced acid inhibition provided by high-dose and high-frequency use of PPI is one of the key factors for successful eradication. Vonoprazan (VPZ), a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB), produces more rapid, profound, and durable suppression of gastric acidity than PPIs. These properties are believed to contribute to achieve higher success rates in H. pylori eradication therapies. Meta-analyses from Japan demonstrated that replacement of PPI with VPZ (20 mg twice daily) in standard triple therapy significantly improved eradication rates without increasing the incidence of adverse events in both first-line and second-line regimens. We therefore speculated that the replacement of PPI with VPZ in HDDT may also achieve a more satisfactory eradication rate.

As a first-line regimen, low-dose Vonoprazan–amoxicillin dual therapy (VA dual therapy) (VPZ 20 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 1500 mg/day) has been reported to reach an eradication rate of nearly 90% in Japan. In China, 10 days of high-dose VA dual therapy (VPZ 20 mg twice daily and amoxicillin 750 mg four times daily) demonstrated an eradication rate of 93.4%. However, although the eradication rate of VA dual therapy (77.2%) was not inferior to standard triple therapy in the United States and Europe in treatment-naïve patients, it was substantially lower than that in East Asia, suggesting that the effectiveness of VA dual therapy may be of regional and/or ethnic differences. Unfortunately, few studies to date have provided background data on H. pylori antibiotic resistance or polymorphism of drug metabolism of participants to enable further analysis of the difference.

In this study, we investigated the efficacy and safety of high-dose VA dual therapy for 14 days as first-line treatment for H. pylori eradication in Northern China by comparing it with bismuth quadruple therapy containing amoxicillin and clarithromycin, and further analyzed the effects of H. pylori clarithromycin resistance on eradication rate.

### Vonoprazan-based triple and dual therapy versus bismuth-based quadruple therapy for Helicobacter pylori infection in China: a three-arm, randomised clinical trial protocol [^113sftDw]. BMC Gastroenterology (2023). Medium credibility.

Vonoprazan (VPZ), a novel potassium-competitive acid blocker, has demonstrated superior inhibition of gastric acid secretion through H + -K + ATPase compared to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). In a study, after seven days of treatment with 20 mg VPZ twice daily, pH levels of ≥ 4 and ≥ 5 were maintained for the entire duration in 100% and 99% of cases, respectively. VPZ has been approved in Japan for the indications of gastric and duodenal ulcers, reflux esophagitis, and as an adjuvant therapy for H. pylori infection. Several meta-analyses have shown that VPZ-based dual or triple therapy outperforms PPI-based regimens in terms of H. pylori eradication rates. While VPZ was officially approved for marketing in China on December 18, 2019, its current approved indication is limited to reflux esophagitis, and its use for H. pylori infection is considered off-label in China. Recent single-center randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in China have confirmed the efficacy and safety of VPZ-based triple therapy, providing promising results in the Chinese population. However, larger and multicenter RCTs are still needed to support its indication approval for H. pylori infection in China.

This study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of vonoprazan (VPZ)-based therapy for treating Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection in China. We propose a three-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which treatment-naive adult patients with H. pylori infection will be assigned to receive one of the following regimens: VPZ and amoxicillin (AMO) therapy (VA-dual), VPZ, AMO, and clarithromycin (CAM) therapy (VAC-triple), or bismuth-based quadruple therapy. The treatment duration for all arms will be 14 days, and the allocation will follow a 1:1:1 ratio. Through this RCT, we aim to obtain robust clinical evidence on the efficacy of VPZ-based therapy in Chinese patients, including its effectiveness in different H. pylori resistance scenarios. The findings from this study will not only contribute to the development of improved H. pylori eradication therapies but also have the potential to reduce the reliance on antibiotics and mitigate the risk of gastric cancer in China.

### Efficacy of a 7-day vonoprazan, sitafloxacin, and amoxicillin triple therapy as a fourth-line salvage regimen for refractory Helicobacter pylori infection [^115DCgCz]. BMC Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Helicobacter pylori infection affects approximately 40% of the global population and is linked to several gastrointestinal disorders, including gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, gastric adenocarcinoma, and gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. The efficacy of first-line treatment regimens has declined to 80–90%. Refractory H. pylori infection, which necessitates more than three treatment courses, has a prevalence of 2–3%. Treatment failure is primarily due to poor treatment compliance, an increase in resistant strains of H. pylori, and insufficient acid suppression.

The updated international H. pylori treatment guidelines recommend the three first line treatments including clarithromycin-based regimens (both sequential and concomitant), levofloxacin-based triple therapy, and bismuth quadruple therapy. Antibiotic susceptibility test-guided treatment was advocated by some guidelines after two or three treatment failures. Unfortunately, such testing is limited in availability and practicality in many regions. Complicated gastric tissue specimen collection, transport, and culture processes are the main hurdles given the fastidious nature of H. pylori. Studies indicated that empirically selected treatment based on prior antibiotic exposure can be as effective as those guided by antibiotic susceptibility tests. Therefore, empirical treatment approaches are commonly employed in real-world settings.

Study procedures and outcomes

After passing the initial screening, eligible participants who agreed to take part in the study signed an informed consent form and completed an electronic questionnaire regarding their demographic information and basic clinical details. They were then randomly assigned to either a 10-day VA group or a 14-day EA group. Patients were verbally introduced to their treatment regimen and the importance of adhering to their medication schedule. Throughout the treatment period, patients were asked to keep a daily record of any adverse events experienced and their medication usage. For mild to moderate adverse events, patients were advised to continue taking their medication while being monitored, with the option of receiving symptomatic treatment if necessary. In cases of serious adverse events, participants were instructed to stop taking the medication and seek medical attention. Patients were advised to undergo a ¹³C/¹⁴C-UBT 4–8 weeks after completing the medication course.

The primary outcome was the H. pylori eradication rate. Successful eradication was determined by a negative result on the 13 C/ 14 C-UBT at least 4 weeks after the end of treatment. The staff conducting the ¹³C/¹⁴C-UBT assessment were kept blind to the treatment group allocation. The secondary outcomes were the incidence of adverse events and medication compliance. Follow-up staff contacted patients 1–3 days after completing medication to assess adverse events and medication compliance. An electronic questionnaire was filled out by accompanying staff to document any adverse events and medication compliance. Adverse events were categorized based on their impact on daily activities as either "mild" (temporary and easily managed, with no significant impact on daily activities), "moderate" (resulting in some discomfort and partially disrupting daily routines), or "severe" (causing severe discomfort and significantly interfering with daily activities). Medication compliance was considered good if patients took at least 80% of the total medication.

### Seven-day vonoprazan and low-dose amoxicillin dual therapy as first-linetreatment: a multicentre randomised trial in Japan [^1164rugM]. Gut (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To date, no randomised trials have compared the efficacy of vonoprazan and amoxicillin dual therapy with other standard regimens for Helicobacter pylori treatment. This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of the 7-day vonoprazan and low-dose amoxicillin dual therapy as a first-line H. pylori treatment, and compared this with vonoprazan-based triple therapy.

Design

This prospective, randomised clinical trial was performed at seven Japanese institutions. Patients with H. pylori –positive culture test and naive to treatment were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either VA-dual therapy (vonoprazan 20 mg+amoxicillin 750 mg twice/day) or VAC-triple therapy (vonoprazan 20 mg+amoxicillin 750 mg+clarithromycin 200 mg twice/day) for 7 days, with stratification by age, sex, H. pylori antimicrobial resistance and institution. Eradication success was evaluated by ¹³C-urea breath test at least 4 weeks after treatment.

Results

Between October 2018 and June 2019, 629 subjects were screened and 335 were randomised. The eradication rates of VA-dual and VAC-triple therapies were 84.5% and 89.2% (p = 0.203) by intention-to-treat analysis, respectively, and 87.1% and 90.2% (p = 0.372) by per-protocol analysis, respectively. VA-dual was non-inferior to VAC-triple in the per-protocol analysis. The eradication rates in strains resistant to clarithromycin for VA-dual were significantly higher than those for VAC-triple (92.3% vs 76.2%; p = 0.048). The incidence of adverse events was equal between groups.

Conclusion

The 7-day vonoprazan and low-dose amoxicillin dual therapy provided acceptable H. pylori eradication rates and a similar effect to vonoprazan-based triple therapy in regions with high clarithromycin resistance.

Discussion

Our study has presented a practical regimen of a 7-day vonoprazan, amoxicillin, and sitafloxacin (VAS) as a fourth-line therapy for refractory H. pylori infection, with a reasonably good response with 70% eradication rate. This efficacy is attributable to the potent acid suppression provided by vonoprazan, and the broad-spectrum antibiotic activity of sitafloxacin. Additionally, the short course and simplicity of the regimen, as well as minimal side effects fostered excellent compliance among participants.

The studied cohort represents typical patients with refractory H. pylori infection, previously failed three standard regimens (PA-PMC or PAMC, PAL, and PBMT). Notably, this cohort had a significant proportion of rapid and ultra-rapid metabolizers of CYP2C19 (65%), which is higher than the general Thai population (45%). The CYP2C19 genotype is a well-known influence on PPIs metabolism, resulting in decrease of acidic environments and compromised the efficacy of various antibiotics like amoxicillin, tetracycline, and clarithromycin. The superiority of vonoprazan to PPIs which partly from its CYP2C19-independent metabolism. Given that H. pylori thrives within a narrow pH range and is susceptible to growth-dependent antibiotics vonoprazan may compensate the reduction of PPIs efficacy.

### Meta-analysis: duration of first-line proton-pump inhibitor based triple therapy for Helicobacter pylori eradication [^111FMogy]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Proton-pump inhibitor (PPI)-based triple therapy is the recommended first-line treatment for Helicobacter pylori infection. A consensus on treatment duration is lacking.

Purpose

To summarize the benefits and harms of different durations of PPI-based triple therapy.

Data Sources

PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and proceedings of major meetings through May 2007.

Study Selection

English-language reports of randomized, controlled trials that compared duration (7, 10, or 14 days) of triple therapy and in which adequate testing confirmed the initial H. pylori infection and its eradication.

Data Extraction

Two authors independently extracted data on study design, treatment, number of patients enrolled and number of patients with successful eradication, disease at enrollment, testing, adverse effects, year of publication, publication format, and country.

Data Synthesis

Of 21 included studies, 11 compared 7-day therapy with 10-day therapy, and 13 compared 7-day therapy with 14-day therapy. Meta-analysis yielded relative risks (RRs) for eradication of 1.05 (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.10) for 7-day compared with 10-day amoxicillin-containing triple therapy (10 studies) and 1.07 (CI, 1.02 to 1.12) for 7-day compared with 14-day therapy (11 studies). Meta-analysis of the 3 studies that compared 7-day with 14-day metronidazole-containing therapy yielded an RR of 1.08 (CI, 0.96 to 1.22). The 7-day versus 10-day comparisons yielded RRs of 1.03 (CI, 0.97 to 1.10) for peptic ulcer disease and 1.10 (CI, 1.02 to 1.20) for nonulcer dyspepsia. For the 7-day versus 14-day comparisons, the RRs were 1.04 (CI, 0.99 to 1.09) and 1.03 (CI, 0.88 to 1.20), respectively. The RRs for frequency of adverse events were 0.98 (CI, 0.85 to 1.14) and 1.08 (CI, 0.84 to 1.40) for 7-day therapy compared with 10- and 14-day therapy, respectively. Diarrhea and taste disturbance were the most frequently reported adverse events (5%).

Limitations

Subgroup analyses were limited by the few studies evaluating different drug regimens and disease at enrollment. Seventeen of the included studies had poor methodological quality or inadequate reporting.

Conclusion

Available data suggest that extending triple therapy beyond 7 days is unlikely to be a clinically useful strategy.

### Vonoprazan-minocycline dual therapy as a first-line treatment ofinfection compared with empirical bismuth-containing quadruple therapy [^112bMhXb]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) affects nearly half of the global population, representing a major public health concern. With the drastically increased antibiotic resistance, the eradication rate of triple therapy has decreased. Current expert consensus and international guidelines advocate bismuth-containing quadruple therapy (B-quadruple therapy) as the primary eradication therapy. The standard triple regimen plus bismuth is the most commonly used B-quadruple therapy in China, but the eradication rate in the real world is less than 85%. In addition, B-quadruple therapy faces constraints due to high side effects and poor compliance. The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics may cause secondary antibiotic resistance, constraining the choice of rescue strategies for those who have failed in first-line eradication. Exploring a simplified eradication program with a high eradication rate and fewer adverse reactions (AEs) is of great significance.

Amoxicillin is a commonly used antibiotic to eradicate H. pylori, and its resistance rate is rare worldwide (less than 4% on average). As a time-dependent antibiotic, the optimal bactericidal effect can be achieved by increasing the dosage and frequency of amoxicillin to maintain plasma concentration above its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). Meanwhile, the enhanced inhibition of gastric acid improves the stability of amoxicillin and keeps H. pylori in a growth state and more sensitive to antibiotics. The newly developed potassium-competitive acid blocker (P-CAB) vonoprazan shows superior acid-inhibiting effects with prolonged duration compared to conventional proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Recent clinical trials have confirmed the efficacy and safety of either high-dose PPI or standard-dose vonoprazan–amoxicillin dual therapy in the H. pylori management of Asia.

Conclusion

In conclusion, the 10-day VA dual therapy showed a satisfactory eradication rate of 91.1% (PP analysis), demonstrating good safety and better compliance compared to the 14-day EA dual therapy. Considering the satisfactory eradication rate of over 90% with the 10-day dual therapy, along with a lower frequency of dosing, a shorter treatment duration, and more convenient administration, it should be prioritized as the first-line eradication regimen.

Data extraction and quality assessment

Two authors independently extracted the data, which were recorded on a standard spreadsheet. Disagreements were resolved through discussions with two other researchers. To understand better the effects of the type or duration of treatment on eradication, we divided the treatments into 14 groups (table 1). Extracted data included the characteristics of the studies (title, publication year, country, and study design), characteristics of the patients (number of patients, age, number of men and women, assessment method for H pylori infection, assessment method for H pylori eradication, observation interval between end of treatment and time H pylori eradication was confirmed), characteristics of the treatments (intervention, dosage, and duration), and outcomes (number of patients included in the intention to treat analysis, number of patients with successful eradication according to the intention to treat analysis, number of patients included in the analysis of adverse events, number of patients presenting with each of the most common adverse events). The primary outcome of this study was the efficacy of each eradication treatment, according to intention to treat analysis. The secondary outcome was the tolerance analysis, including the occurrence of adverse events in each eradication treatment. Two authors independently assessed the quality of evidence using both the Jadad scaleand the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for evaluating study bias.
