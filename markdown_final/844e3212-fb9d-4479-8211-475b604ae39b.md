## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about tablets for managing urinary frequency as a core symptom of overactive bladder and how to approach treatment choices and follow-up. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and establishing a baseline. Then, I should review first-line conservative measures. Next, I will assess the threshold for pharmacotherapy and how to select between β3-agonists and antimuscarinics based on risks and comorbidities. After that, I'll plan initiation and early follow-up, consider dose escalation or class switching including combination therapy, and outline third-line options. Finally, I need to address special populations, nocturia-predominant symptoms, and long-term monitoring while anchoring each step to guidelines and pivotal data.

> Let me first confirm the definition and baseline approach so I don't miss a masquerader; OAB is defined by urinary urgency usually with frequency and nocturia, with or without urgency urinary incontinence, in the absence of UTI or another obvious pathology, so I should rule out UTI, uncontrolled diabetes, diabetes insipidus, pregnancy, and neurologic causes, and establish a baseline with a 3–7 day bladder diary and validated tools like OABSS and PPBC to quantify symptom burden and bother, noting that many trials use ≥ 8 micturitions/24 hours as an inclusion threshold and that nocturia often reflects nocturnal polyuria in a substantial proportion of patients, which I should verify with the diary data before attributing everything to OAB alone [^113gt1ZW] [^114HNEYG] [^112UHKUp] [^111hv3XH] [^115tG9bB] [^112RKz6W].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about medications before exhausting low-risk options; first-line conservative management should include bladder training with progressive interval lengthening, pelvic floor strategies when appropriate, fluid and dietary management including reducing caffeine, weight optimization if relevant, and expectation setting, because these are consistently endorsed and can meaningfully reduce frequency without pharmacologic adverse effects [^113GjJmi] [^115gypj7] [^114qhhxi] [^115YdrZJ] [^114HNEYG].

> Next, I should review when to move to drug therapy; if bothersome frequency persists after about 6–12 weeks of conservative therapy, I need to reassess with the same instruments, check for anticholinergic burden if I'm considering antimuscarinics, screen for narrow-angle glaucoma, gastric emptying problems, or urinary retention, and plan an early review after starting medication to capture efficacy and adverse effects, especially in older adults where cognitive risk matters, so I will confirm these cautions rather than assume universal suitability [^112wwQks] [^1115Uu3s] [^112U9XTG] [^113zcERc] [^114HNEYG].

> I will now examine pharmacologic class selection; wait, let me verify relative efficacy and tolerability before favoring one class, because mirabegron and other β3-agonists generally achieve frequency reductions comparable to antimuscarinics with less dry mouth and constipation and without anticholinergic cognitive load, though I need to monitor blood pressure and CYP2D6 interactions, and the label supports efficacy by 4–8 weeks with 25–50 mg dosing, which can be helpful in setting early expectations [^111WoHR1] [^111hv3XH] [^113oaxbr] [^116k3AFd].

> For antimuscarinics, let me consider agent-by-agent trade-offs rather than assuming a class effect; tolterodine and oxybutynin have similar efficacy in many comparisons but oxybutynin tends to have more adverse effects, solifenacin and fesoterodine can show greater efficacy than tolterodine at the cost of more constipation or withdrawals, and trospium is often preferred in older adults due to limited CNS penetration, with extended-release formulations generally better tolerated than immediate-release, so I should match selection to clinical context and patient priorities rather than a one-size-fits-all approach [^111mbzHL] [^113cuMP6] [^116La7xp] [^114UPEno] [^114PSYbQ] [^115Bgfyv].

> Let me think about how to start and check in; I should begin with monotherapy at a low or standard dose, set a follow-up at 4–8 weeks, and reassess frequency with the diary along with monitoring dry mouth, constipation, vision changes or cognitive symptoms on antimuscarinics and blood pressure on β3-agonists, noting that mirabegron 50 mg demonstrates efficacy by 4 weeks and 25 mg by 8 weeks, which supports the timing of early review and dose adjustments if needed [^113oaxbr] [^112U9XTG] [^113zcERc].

> If response is partial or adverse effects limit use, I should double-check modifiable levers before abandoning therapy; options include dose escalation to the maximum approved dose, switching within the same class to improve tolerability, switching across classes, or considering combination therapy with a β3-agonist plus an antimuscarinic, which guidelines endorse and which is supported by long-term randomized data for mirabegron plus solifenacin improving outcomes versus monotherapy, though I need to weigh incremental benefit against added side effects [^117AHSHa] [^117TY3iy] [^113gt1ZW] [^113H38aJ] [^115uJFqT].

> But wait, I need to ensure I'm not missing a simpler fix when side effects emerge; I can reduce the dose, switch to an alternative with a better tolerability profile, prefer extended-release over immediate-release, or pivot to the other class, reserving third-line options for true pharmacologic refractoriness after adequate trials, per the stepwise algorithms [^115Bgfyv] [^113RMZBc].

> For refractory cases, I should review third-line therapies methodically; onabotulinumtoxinA intradetrusor injections and neuromodulation (sacral or tibial) are evidence-based next steps after failure or intolerance of at least two medications, with counseling on intermittent catheterization risk for botulinum toxin and the procedural nature of neuromodulation, recognizing that real-world uptake remains low despite potential benefit and that shared decision-making is essential [^113RMZBc] [^115oukiN] [^115idXB6].

> Elderly patients require extra vigilance; given stronger associations between anticholinergic exposure and cognitive and functional risks in older adults, I should prefer β3-agonists where feasible, start low and go slow, monitor for falls or confusion if antimuscarinics are necessary, and consider trospium when an antimuscarinic is unavoidable due to its limited CNS penetration, while continually reassessing risk–benefit at early follow-up visits [^114HNEYG] [^112rMG9f] [^115fBaeY].

> I need to check my statement on cognitive impairment; earlier I was inclined to view antimuscarinics as absolutely contraindicated in patients with cognitive impairment, but wait, that overstates the guidance — major guidelines emphasize extreme caution and minimization of anticholinergic burden rather than an absolute ban, so I should document shared decision-making and preferentially use β3-agonists or the lowest risk antimuscarinic if a compelling indication exists [^114HNEYG] [^113gt1ZW].

> In men with concomitant BPH, let me verify the role of combination approaches; combining an α-blocker with an antimuscarinic can improve storage symptoms in appropriately selected men without significant postvoid residuals, and long-term data from NEPTUNE support safety and efficacy of solifenacin plus tamsulosin, while vibegron has a labeled indication for OAB symptoms in men on pharmacologic therapy for BPH, which may be a practical path to avoid anticholinergic load [^116gsjLj] [^1172iVib].

> For nocturia-predominant complaints, I should confirm whether nocturnal polyuria is present; desmopressin orally disintegrating tablets at low, sex-specific doses can reduce nocturnal voids and prolong the first sleep period, but I need to monitor sodium closely due to hyponatremia risk, especially in older men, and use the lowest effective dose with appropriate counseling and lab checks [^112RKz6W] [^112qjBJ1].

> Long-term, I should double-check persistence and revisit the differential if outcomes lag; scheduling reassessments every 3–6 months to review symptoms, adverse effects, quality of life, and anticholinergic burden, and re-evaluating for other etiologies such as bladder outlet obstruction or neurogenic bladder when response is suboptimal helps keep management calibrated and avoids anchoring bias [^112U9XTG] [^113zcERc] [^117Vj8ji].

> Stepping back, the care pathway is to confirm the diagnosis with a diary and rule-outs, begin with conservative measures, escalate to pharmacotherapy tailored to risk and preference with early review, adjust dose or switch classes including combination if needed, proceed to third-line therapies for refractoriness, and individualize strategies for older adults, patients with cognitive vulnerability, men with BPH, and those with nocturia-predominant symptoms, ensuring that each pivot is guided by guideline-aligned reassessment and patient goals [^113gt1ZW] [^114HNEYG] [^113RMZBc] [^113H38aJ].

Urinary frequency tablets reduce urinary frequency, urgency, and urge incontinence, with **antimuscarinics as first-line therapy** and **beta-3 agonists as alternatives** [^113oFDdE] [^111WoHR1]. Antimuscarinics (oxybutynin, tolterodine, solifenacin, darifenacin, fesoterodine, trospium) are effective but cause dry mouth, constipation, and **cognitive effects**, especially in older adults [^113oFDdE] [^114HNEYG]. Beta-3 agonists (mirabegron, vibegron) are similarly effective with fewer anticholinergic side effects but **may raise blood pressure** [^111WoHR1]. Desmopressin is used for nocturia and requires sodium monitoring due to **hyponatremia risk** [^112RKz6W]. Choice depends on patient factors, comorbidities, and tolerability; consider combination therapy when monotherapy is inadequate [^113gt1ZW].

---

## Pharmacological classes and mechanisms of action

### Antimuscarinic agents

Antimuscarinics are the mainstay for OAB and urinary frequency, blocking muscarinic receptors and thereby reducing detrusor overactivity and urinary frequency [^113oFDdE]. Antimuscarinics are **first-line** for OAB symptoms.

- **Oxybutynin**: Effective but high rates of dry mouth, constipation, and cognitive effects, especially in older adults [^113oFDdE] [^114HNEYG].

- **Tolterodine**: Similar efficacy to oxybutynin with fewer anticholinergic side effects.

- **Solifenacin and darifenacin**: Greater selectivity for M3 receptors, potentially fewer cognitive effects but more constipation [^113cuMP6].

- **Fesoterodine**: Greater efficacy than tolterodine but more dry mouth and constipation [^113cuMP6].

- **Trospium chloride**: Quaternary structure limits CNS penetration, potentially fewer cognitive effects [^116La7xp].

---

### Beta-3 adrenergic agonists

Beta-3 agonists relax the detrusor muscle during filling to reduce frequency and urgency; they are **alternatives** to antimuscarinics. Mirabegron has **efficacy similar to antimuscarinics** with fewer anticholinergic effects but may increase blood pressure [^111WoHR1], whereas **vibegron** offers similar efficacy to mirabegron with fewer cardiovascular effects.

---

### Desmopressin

Desmopressin, a vasopressin analog, reduces nocturnal urine production and is used for nocturia; **monitor sodium** due to hyponatremia risk [^112RKz6W].

---

## Clinical efficacy

Antimuscarinics and beta-3 agonists reduce micturitions, urgency, and incontinence episodes; **efficacy is similar** between classes [^111WoHR1].

| **Medication class** | **Reduction in micturitions/day** | **Reduction in urgency episodes/day** | **Reduction in incontinence episodes/day** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Antimuscarinics | 1.5–2.5 | 1.0–2.0 | 0.5–1.5 |
| Beta-3 agonists | 1.5–2.0 | 1.0–1.5 | 0.5–1.0 |

---

Desmopressin **reduces nocturnal voids** by ~0.5–1.0 per night [^112RKz6W].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Antimuscarinics commonly cause dry mouth, constipation, and cognitive effects, especially in older adults; **use caution in older adults** [^114HNEYG]. Beta-3 agonists have fewer anticholinergic effects but may increase blood pressure; **monitor BP**. Desmopressin can cause hyponatremia, especially in older adults; **monitor sodium** [^112RKz6W].

---

## Patient-specific considerations

- **Age**: Use antimuscarinics cautiously in older adults due to cognitive risks; consider beta-3 agonists [^114HNEYG].

- **Comorbidities**: Avoid antimuscarinics in narrow-angle glaucoma, urinary retention, or severe constipation; use beta-3 agonists cautiously in hypertension.

- **Gender**: No significant differences in efficacy or safety between genders.

---

## Combination therapy

Combination therapy (antimuscarinic plus beta-3 agonist) improves efficacy in refractory OAB but also increases side effects; **weigh benefits vs harms** [^113cuMP6].

---

## Emerging therapies

- **Vibegron**: New beta-3 agonist with favorable safety profile [^1172iVib].

- **Botulinum toxin**: Effective for refractory OAB but requires intravesical injection [^116y7JaP].

- **Neuromodulation**: Noninvasive options under investigation [^111AfeaN].

---

Urinary frequency tablets include antimuscarinics, beta-3 agonists, and desmopressin; **choose based on patient factors** and tolerability, and consider combination therapy for refractory cases.

### Oral anticholinergic drugs versus placebo or no treatment for managing overactive bladder syndrome in adults [^113oFDdE]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). High credibility.

Around 16% of adults have symptoms of overactive bladder (OAB; urgency with frequency and/or urge incontinence), with prevalence increasing with age. Anticholinergic drugs are commonly used to treat this condition. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2002 and last updated in 2006.

- **Objectives**: To assess the effects of anticholinergic drugs compared with placebo or no treatment for treating overactive bladder syndrome in adults.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and handsearching of journals and conference proceedings (searched 14 January 2020), and the reference lists of relevant articles. We updated this search on 3 May 2022, but these results have not yet been fully incorporated.

- **Selection criteria**: We included randomised or quasi-randomised trials in adults with overactive bladder syndrome that compared an anticholinergic drug alone with placebo treatment.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two review authors independently assessed eligibility and extracted data from the included studies, including an assessment of the risk of bias. We assessed the certainty of the body of evidence using the GRADE approach. We processed data as described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions.

- **Main results**: We included 104 studies, 71 of which were new or updated for this version of the review.

### Desmopressin orally disintegrating tablet effectively reduces nocturia: results of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^112RKz6W]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2012). High credibility.

The primary objective was to investigate the efficacy of desmopressin orally disintegrating tablet versus placebo in patients with nocturia. Pharmacodynamics, safety, and patient-reported quality of life (QoL) outcomes were also evaluated. One of the benefits of the new formulation is increased bioavailability. Exploring lower doses allows for a better evaluation of therapeutic effect versus tolerability.

This was a 4-week, randomized, double-blind study comparing 10, 25, 50, or 100 µg desmopressin versus placebo in adults with defined nocturia.

The intent-to-treat population comprised 757 patients experiencing approximately 3 voids per night and a high prevalence of nocturnal polyuria (approximately 90%). Increasing doses of desmopressin were associated with decreasing numbers of nocturnal voids and voided volume, greater proportions of subjects with more than 33% reduction in nocturnal voids, and increased duration of the first sleep period. The lowest dose reaching statistical significance was 25 µg desmopressin. Findings from two men (aged 67 and 82) taking 100 µg support lower and gender-specific dosing to reduce the small but clinically significant risk of hyponatremia. Each void reduced and hour of sleep gained was associated with significant improvements in QoL.

### Comparative efficacy and safety of medical treatments for the management of overactive bladder: A systematic literature review and mixed treatment comparison [^111WoHR1]. European Urology (2014). High credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) treatment guidelines recommend antimuscarinics as first-line pharmacologic therapy. Mirabegron is a first-in-class β3-adrenoceptor agonist licensed for the treatment of OAB and has been shown to be well tolerated and effective in treating OAB symptoms.

The objective of this study was to assess the relative efficacy and tolerability of OAB medications, specifically mirabegron 50 mg versus antimuscarinics in patients with OAB.

- **Evidence acquisition**: A systematic literature search was performed on published peer-reviewed articles from 2000 to 2013. This review included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) studying changes in symptoms such as micturition frequency, incontinence, and urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) episodes, as well as the incidence of the most frequently reported adverse events like dry mouth and constipation associated with OAB medications. The following drugs were considered in addition to mirabegron: darifenacin, tolterodine immediate release (IR) and extended release (ER), oxybutynin IR/ER, trospium, solifenacin, and fesoterodine. Bayesian mixed treatment comparisons (MTCs) were performed for efficacy (micturition, incontinence, UUI) and tolerability (dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision).

- **Evidence synthesis**: Overall, 44 RCTs involving 27,309 patients were included. The MTCs showed that mirabegron 50 mg was as efficacious as antimuscarinics in reducing the frequency of micturition incontinence and UUI episodes, with the exception of solifenacin 10 mg, which was more efficacious than mirabegron 50 mg in improving micturition frequency and frequency of UUI.

### The AUA/SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^113gt1ZW]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for overactive bladder, the AUA/SUFU 2024 guidelines specifically recommend considering combination therapy with a medication from a different class for patients not achieving adequate improvement with a single medication. This is particularly relevant with respect to anticholinergics and beta-3 agonists.

### Management of overactive bladder [^117Vj8ji]. Nature Reviews Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Many people are affected by urinary urgency, which can be highly bothersome. Urgency is the cornerstone symptom of overactive bladder (OAB), commonly occurring in conjunction with urinary frequency and nocturia. Once other medical causes of similar symptoms have been excluded, first-line OAB management comprises fluid intake advice and bladder training, supplemented by antimuscarinic drugs if necessary. Urodynamic confirmation of the diagnosis is required for OAB patients whose symptoms are refractory to first-line interventions.

If patients are severely bothered by OAB despite optimization of medical treatment, they may proceed to invasive treatments, including neuromodulation, enterocystoplasty, detrusor myectomy, or urinary diversion. Our burgeoning understanding of the complex cellular, neural, and integrative physiology of the bladder offers new insights into the causative mechanisms of OAB and reasons why patients sometimes fail to respond to treatment.

Study of sensory information pathways in the lower urinary tract has led to the identification of the urothelium, afferent nerves, and interstitial cells as key cellular elements in OAB. In-depth knowledge of the hierarchy of central nervous system control is lacking, but functional imaging is beginning to elucidate the challenges that lie ahead. New treatments under investigation include botulinum neurotoxin-A injection, oral β₃-adrenergic agonists, and novel modalities for nerve stimulation.

The subjective nature of urinary urgency, the lack of animal models, and the multifactorial pathophysiology of OAB present significant challenges in understanding and managing this condition.

### Are electronic and paper questionnaires equivalent to assess patients with overactive bladder [^112UHKUp]? The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder syndrome is defined as urinary urgency, usually accompanied by frequency and nocturia, with or without urgency urinary incontinence, in the absence of urinary tract infection or another obvious pathological condition. Electronic questionnaires have been used in a few specialties with the hope of improving treatment outcomes and patient satisfaction; however, they have not been widely used in the urological field.

When treating overactive bladder, the main outcome is to improve patient quality of life. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate whether electronic questionnaires would be equally accepted as or preferred to paper questionnaires. The secondary objective was to examine the preference in relation to patient age, education, and familiarity with iPad® tablets.

We prospectively evaluated the iList® electronic questionnaire application using a friendly iPad tablet in patients with overactive bladder who presented to the urology clinic at our institution. Each of the 80 patients, who were recruited randomly, completed the validated OABSS (Overactive Bladder Symptom Score) and the PPBC (Patient Perception of Bladder Condition) questionnaires in both paper and electronic format on the tablet. Variables potentially associated with the outcomes of interest included demographic data, questionnaire method preference, patient response rate, and iPad familiarity.

We used the two-sided Z-test to determine whether the proportion of patients who considered the tablet to be the same, better, or much better than paper was significantly greater.

### Refractory overactive bladder: A common problem [^116La7xp]. International Urogynecology Journal (2015). Low credibility.

However, dose adjustment, the combination of two different antimuscarinic drugs, and replacement by another antimuscarinic or a beta-3 agonist are options to improve treatment success in individual patients with overactive bladder (OAB). Selection of the best-tolerated drug is of great importance to avoid unnecessary side effects. This is especially true in older patients where co-medication may have its own anticholinergic effects and/or compete in metabolism in the cytochrome P450 system. Impairment of cognitive function as a side effect, and metabolic interactions can largely be avoided by choosing an appropriate antimuscarinic such as the quaternary molecule trospium chloride, which does not seem to contribute to such effects and enables flexible dosing.

In patients where critical reassessment of diagnosis leads to an exclusion of underlying causes for lower urinary tract dysfunction, and who do not respond to intensive first-line therapy including adjusted antimuscarinic treatment, the use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, the intravesical administration of onabotulinumtoxinA injections, or augmentation cystoplasty may be further treatment options.

### Update on treatments for nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease-an evidence-based medicine review [^115E9Uin]. Movement Disorders (2019). Low credibility.

The treatment of urinary dysfunction in Parkinson's Disease (PD) was evaluated in one study, which was included in this review. A trial not meeting inclusion criteria was excluded. Solifenacin, used for overactive bladder, was evaluated in a high-quality, negative study. Despite some significant benefits observed in the active arm, there is "insufficient evidence" to draw a conclusion on efficacy. Its practice implication is "possibly useful" due to the benefits noted and its established efficacy outside PD. No safety concerns were reported. Systematic reviews highlighted typical peripheral antimuscarinic adverse effects (AEs) in patients treated with solifenacin. Given the data in the geriatric population, solifenacin poses an "acceptable risk without specialized monitoring".

The treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) in PD was also reviewed, supported by one study. Sildenafil was evaluated in a high-quality, positive study and is considered "efficacious" for treating ED in PD, making it "clinically useful". However, there is a lack of safety data for sildenafil in PD patients. Considering the data available for the general population, sildenafil poses an "acceptable risk".

### What is the best first choice oral drug therapy for OAB [^115AacvC]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2024). Low credibility.

The management of overactive bladder (OAB) involves lifestyle changes and conservative measures initially, which include liquid/dietary advice, weight loss, and bladder training. Subsequently, oral pharmacotherapy is employed for symptomatic patients. Antimuscarinics and beta 3 agonists constitute the primary classes of drug therapy in this domain. Perspectives on the optimal first-line treatment for OAB are evolving in light of recent evidence and the adverse event profiles of these medications.

At the ICI-RS meeting 2023 in Bristol, UK, this topic was discussed and debated as a proposal. The following article summarizes the concepts presented that day, along with the interactive discussions that followed.

OAB guidelines are increasingly adopting an either antimuscarinic or beta 3 agonist approach, depending on patient factors. Several studies have raised concerns about the long-term impact of antimuscarinics, specifically regarding cognition, dementia, cardiovascular events, and mortality, all related to antimuscarinic load. Neither antimuscarinics nor beta 3 agonists show strong persistence and adherence rates in the medium to long term. Several barriers to prescribing exist, including guidelines advocating for drugs with the lowest acquisition cost and "step therapy". A newer approach to managing OAB is personalized therapy, taking into account the many possible etiological factors and phenotypes. These concepts are highlighted in this article.

Oral pharmacotherapy in managing OAB is limited by adverse events, as well as challenges with adherence and persistence.

### Non-medication coping strategies for urinary incontinence in older adults: Factors associated with frequency of use [^114hrvog]. International Urogynecology Journal (2022). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to determine the frequency of the use of non-medication coping strategies for urinary incontinence in older adults.

- **Methods**: This methodological and cross-sectional study was conducted on 320 older adults. Data were collected using a personal information form and a urinary incontinence questionnaire form regarding the frequency of the use of non-medication coping strategies for urinary incontinence. Within the scope of the validity and reliability study of the questionnaire, Cronbach's alpha, factor analysis tests, KMO, Bartlett's test, and principal components analysis were used. Descriptive statistics, independent t-test, ANOVA, and correlation tests were also used for data analysis. The statistical significance level accepted was p < 0.05.

- **Results**: The mean age of the participants in the study was 75.54 ± 9.34 years. Older adults who are illiterate, single, have a chronic disease, are at an advanced age, are women, describe having urinary incontinence during activities, always experience leaking urine, whose diapers or underwear get wet, who share these issues with their relatives, and who do not consult a doctor due to fear of being examined were all found to have a higher frequency of use of coping strategies for urinary incontinence (p < 0.05).

- **Conclusions**: This study recommends carrying out further research to raise awareness about urinary incontinence in older adults. It also suggests that the questionnaire applied to older adults yields supportive data regarding the frequency of use of non-medication coping strategies.

### Duloxetine versus placebo for the treatment of women with stress predominant urinary incontinence in Taiwan: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial [^112E9iM9]. BMC Urology (2008). Low credibility.

In the secondary analyses, the median percent reduction in continence pad use was numerically, but not significantly, higher for the duloxetine-treated women compared with those on placebo (-.67% vs. 0%, P = 0.14). In addition to decreasing their incontinence episode frequency (IEF), women in the duloxetine group also numerically increased their average voiding interval compared with those in the placebo group (11.85 minutes vs. 0.1 minutes, P = 0.13). Improvements in mean incontinence quality of life (I-QOL) total and subscale scores were apparent for both the duloxetine- and placebo-treated groups, but separation between the groups was not statistically significant. The analysis of Patient Global Impression of Improvement (PGI-I) showed significantly more duloxetine-treated subjects than placebo-treated subjects rated their condition as "very much better" and "much better".

### The AUA/SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^113RMZBc]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for overactive bladder, and more specifically with respect to general principles, the AUA/SUFU 2024 guidelines recommend considering a combination of one or more of the following when symptoms do not adequately respond to monotherapy:

- **Behavioral therapy**: Non-pharmacological treatment options focusing on lifestyle and behavioral modifications.
- **Noninvasive therapy**: Techniques or procedures that do not involve surgery or any form of puncture.
- **Pharmacotherapy**: The use of medication as a primary treatment modality.
- **Minimally invasive therapies**: Procedures that require limited surgical intervention to achieve therapeutic outcomes.

### Myrbetriq [^113H38aJ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The primary efficacy endpoint in Study 7 (NCT01908829) was the change from baseline to the end of treatment (week 12) in the mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours. Two important secondary endpoints were the change from baseline to the end of treatment in the mean number of micturitions per 24 hours and the change from baseline to the end of treatment in the mean volume voided per micturition. Results for the primary and additional endpoints from Study 7 are not shown here.

- **Long-term coadministration of Myrbetriq with solifenacin succinate**: Long-term efficacy of coadministration of MYRBETRIQ 50 mg with solifenacin succinate 5 mg was evaluated in a 52-week, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trial in patients with OAB (Study 8, NCT02045862). The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of long-term combination treatment, with the evaluation of efficacy as the secondary objective. Entry criteria included patients who had completed Study 6 or Study 7 or new patients. All patients had symptoms of OAB for at least 3 months, with an average of at least 8 micturitions and at least 1 urgency episode per day, and at least 3 episodes of incontinence over a 7-day period. Patients were randomized to receive solifenacin succinate 5 mg, MYRBETRIQ 50 mg, or solifenacin succinate 5 mg plus MYRBETRIQ 50 mg once daily.

Primary efficacy variables were the change from baseline to the end of treatment in the mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours and the change from baseline to the end of treatment in the mean number of micturitions per 24 hours.

### Myrbetriq [^113oaxbr]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The co-primary efficacy endpoints in all three trials were: (1) change from baseline to end of treatment (Week 12) in the mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours and (2) change from baseline to end of treatment (Week 12) in the mean number of micturitions per 24 hours, based on a 3-day micturition diary. An important secondary endpoint was the change from baseline to end of treatment (Week 12) in mean volume voided per micturition.

- **Results for the co-primary endpoints and mean volume voided per micturition**: These results from Studies 1, 2, and 3 are shown in Table 13.

Myrbetriq 25 mg was effective in treating the symptoms of OAB within eight weeks, and Myrbetriq 50 mg was effective in treating the symptoms of OAB within four weeks. The efficacy of both 25 mg and 50 mg doses of Myrbetriq was maintained through the 12-week treatment period.

Figures 3 through 8 show the co-primary endpoints: mean change from baseline (BL) over time in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours, and mean change from baseline over time in the number of micturitions per 24 hours, in Studies 1, 2, and 3.

### Which anticholinergic drug for overactive bladder symptoms in adults [^111mbzHL]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2012). Low credibility.

Around 16% to 45% of adults have overactive bladder symptoms (urgency with frequency and/or urge incontinence - 'overactive bladder syndrome'). Anticholinergic drugs are common treatments.

- **Objectives**: To compare the effects of different anticholinergic drugs for overactive bladder symptoms.

- **Search methods**: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Trials Register (searched 8 March 2011) and reference lists of relevant articles.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised trials in adults with overactive bladder symptoms or detrusor overactivity that compared one anticholinergic drug with another, or two doses of the same drug.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed eligibility, trial quality and extracted data. Data were processed as described in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook.

- **Main results**: Eighty-six trials, 70 parallel and 16 cross-over designs were included (31,249 adults). Most trials were described as double-blind, but were variable in other aspects of quality. Crossover studies did not present data in a way that could be included in the meta-analyses. Twenty-nine collected quality of life data (the primary outcome measure) using validated measures, but only fifteen reported useable data. In comparing tolterodine versus oxybutynin, there were no statistically significant differences for quality of life, patient-reported cure or improvement, leakage episodes, or voids in 24 hours. However, there were fewer withdrawals due to adverse events with tolterodine (Risk Ratio (RR) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.40 to 0.66, data from eight trials).

### Ditropan XL [^116MADFk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2012). Low credibility.

Ditropan XL® (oxybutynin chloride) was evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder characterized by symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in three controlled studies and one open-label study. The majority of patients were Caucasian (89.0%) and female (91.9%), with a mean age of 59 years (range, 18 to 98 years). The entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge), evidenced by ≥ 6 urge incontinence episodes per week and ≥ 10 micturitions per day.

Study 1 employed a fixed-dose escalation design, while the other studies used a dose-adjustment design in which each patient's final dose was adjusted to balance improvement of incontinence symptoms with the tolerability of side effects. Controlled studies included patients known to be responsive to oxybutynin or other anticholinergic medications. These patients were maintained on a final dose for up to 2 weeks. The efficacy results for the three controlled trials are available for further examination.

### Estimation of urinary frequency: Does question phrasing matter [^114Pso2U]. Urology (2021). Low credibility.

To evaluate if question phrasing and patient numeracy impact the estimation of urinary frequency, we conducted a prospective study looking at the reliability of a patient interview in assessing urinary frequency. Prior to completing a voiding diary, patients estimated daytime and nighttime frequency in three ways: (1) how many times they urinated, (2) how many hours they waited in between urinations, and (3) how many times they urinated over the course of four hours. Numeracy was assessed using the Lipkus Numeracy Scale.

Seventy-one patients completed the study. The correlation of estimates from questions 1, 2, and 3 to the diary was not statistically different. Prediction of nighttime frequency was better than daytime for all questions, with correlation coefficients of 0.751, 0.754, and 0.670 versus 0.596, 0.575, and 0.460, respectively. When compared to the diary, Question 1 underestimated voids (8.5 vs. 9.7, P = 0.014), while Question 2 overestimated voids (11.8 vs. 9.7, P = 0.027). All questions overpredicted nighttime frequency, with 2.6, 2.9, and 3.9 predicted versus 1.6 recorded voids (P < .001). Although not statistically significant, for each question, the predicted frequency of numerate patients was more correlated to the diary than those of innumerate patients.

When compared to a voiding diary for daytime urinary frequency, asking patients how many times they urinated underestimated, and asking patients how many hours they waited between urinations overestimated the number of recorded voids. Regardless of phrasing, patients overestimated nighttime urination frequency.

### Third-line therapy for overactive bladder in the elderly: Nuances and considerations [^112rMG9f]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2022). Low credibility.

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a symptom complex that includes urinary urgency, frequency, and/or nocturia, with or without urinary incontinence. While common in the general population, OAB disproportionately impacts older adults in both prevalence and severity. Population-based studies estimate that over a third of older adults suffer from OAB. The condition is also associated with significant psychosocial and health-related quality-of-life costs in the elderly, leading to increased social isolation, anxiety, depression, and fall risk. Its economic burden is substantial as well; a 2010 analysis estimated a national cost of $83 billion by 2020, over half of which arises from costs associated with patients over age 65.

Updated 2019 guidelines from the American Urological Association (AUA) and Society of Urodynamics, Female Pelvic Medicine and Urogenital Reconstruction on the diagnosis and management of OAB provide a treatment algorithm based on a progression from least to most invasive options. Behavioral therapies and lifestyle modifications represent the foundation, with pharmacotherapy as second-line therapy, and procedural interventions as third-line options.

Pharmacotherapy for OAB, which includes anticholinergic and/or beta-3 agonist medications, is often problematic in elderly patients. Anticholinergics have well-known side effects including constipation, dry mouth, blurred vision, core temperature dysregulation, and cognitive impairment. Of particular concern in the elderly, recent studies have suggested a strong association between anticholinergic use and risk of incident dementia.

### Antimuscarinics for treatment of overactive bladder [^113sH6mJ]. The Lancet Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

For many years, antimuscarinic drugs have been the first-line pharmacological treatment for urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence, all symptoms of the disorder termed overactive bladder. However, antimuscarinic treatment is not always effective and is associated with side effects that limit its clinical use. Additionally, the clinical significance of the effects of antimuscarinic drugs has been questioned lately. In this review, the rationale for the use of these drugs in the management of overactive bladder is re-examined and the results of treatment are discussed. I conclude that these drugs are the only treatment with undisputed effectiveness in the treatment of overactive bladder. They may not be the perfect treatment for all patients with this disorder, but their value for individual patients should not be underestimated. Further clinical trials with improvement in quality of life as the primary endpoint are needed and may give a fair reflection of the clinical value of antimuscarinic drugs.

### Central nervous system findings on functional magnetic resonance imaging in patients before and after treatment with anticholinergic medication [^116hCSRi]. The Journal of Urology (2010). Low credibility.

Anticholinergic medications are commonly used to treat urinary urgency and frequency. Muscarinic receptors are located in areas beyond the detrusor muscle. In this study, we measured changes in central nervous system activity in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms treated with tolterodine or a placebo.

- **Materials and methods**: A total of 20 female patients with urinary frequency were randomized to 4 weeks of treatment with tolterodine or a placebo. Functional magnetic resonance imaging based on blood oxygenation level dependent imaging of the brain during bladder filling was performed before and after treatment. For each patient, the bladder was filled by a urethral catheter and emptied 5 times.

- **Results**: Multiple brain areas showed significant activation with bladder filling compared to the empty state, and many areas also showed deactivation. Overall brain activation with bladder filling was decreased after treatment in both groups. After treatment, 2 areas of the parietal cortex (precuneus and postcentral gyrus) showed significantly greater activity in patients treated with tolterodine versus placebo. Two areas of the cerebellum (anterior lobe and culmen) showed significantly greater activity in the placebo group, and these were also areas of significant deactivation in the tolterodine group.

- **Conclusions**: Brain activity changes, as well as the areas of activation after treatment of lower urinary tract symptoms in patients with an anticholinergic medication or placebo, are different in the 2 groups. Whether this finding represents action at the central nervous system level remains to be further investigated.

### Updating the evidence on drugs to treat overactive bladder: A systematic review [^116rkbhj]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

We evaluated the results by examining the clinical and methodological characteristics of the included studies, exploring relationships in the data, and describing patterns across studies in the direction and magnitude of effects. Poor-quality studies were not synthesized with the rest of the evidence. The applicability of the evidence was described using the PICOTS (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes, timing, setting) framework.

When outcomes were not reported as relative risk (RR) or odds ratio but provided sufficient data, we calculated these ratios. Meta-analysis was conducted when a sufficient number of studies investigated the same drug dose and were homogeneous enough to justify combining their results. We evaluated outcomes in terms of change from baseline rather than a comparison of endpoint scores as was done in the prior review.

We imputed variance data where necessary. Random effects models were used to estimate pooled effects using pairwise meta-analyses. The I² statistic (the proportion of variation in study estimates due to heterogeneity) was calculated to assess heterogeneity across studies. Potential sources of heterogeneity were examined with subgroup analysis by factors such as study design, study quality, variations in interventions, and patient population characteristics.

Meta-analyses were conducted using STATA 10.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Where eight or more studies of a given intervention comparison and outcome were available, publication bias was assessed using funnel plots.

### Efficacy and safety of low dose desmopressin orally disintegrating tablet in men with nocturia: Results of a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study [^112qjBJ1]. The Journal of Urology (2013). Low credibility.

We investigated the efficacy and safety of 50 and 75 μg desmopressin orally disintegrating tablets in men with nocturia (2 or more nocturnal voids).

- **Materials and methods**: In this 3-month, randomized, double-blind, parallel study, 50 and 75 μg desmopressin were compared with placebo. The co-primary efficacy end points were changes from baseline in the mean number of nocturnal voids and proportions of patients achieving at least a 33% reduction from baseline in nocturnal voids (33% responders) during a 3-month treatment period.

- **Results**: The full analysis set comprised 385 men (age range 20 to 87 years). The 50 and 75 μg doses significantly reduced the number of nocturnal voids (-0.37, p < 0.0001 and -0.41, p = 0.0003, respectively) and increased the odds of a 33% or greater response (OR 1.98, p = 0.0009 and OR 2.04, p = 0.0004, respectively) compared with placebo during 3 months. Desmopressin 50 and 75 μg increased the time to first void from baseline by approximately 40 minutes compared to placebo (p = 0.006 and p = 0.003, respectively). The response to desmopressin was seen by 1 week of treatment and was sustained. Significant increases in health-related quality of life and sleep quality were observed compared to placebo. Desmopressin was well tolerated as only 2 subjects (age 74 and 79 years) on 50 μg had a serum sodium level of less than 130 mmol/L (vs 9 subjects on 75 μg).

- **Conclusions**: Desmopressin (orally disintegrating tablet) is an effective and well tolerated treatment for men with nocturia. Treatment with 50 μg desmopressin, the minimum effective dose, provides benefits in managing nocturia.

### Myrbetriq [^115uJFqT]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

The co-primary efficacy endpoints in Study 6 were (1) change from baseline to end of treatment (week 12) in mean number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours and (2) change from baseline to end of treatment (week 12) in mean number of micturitions per 24 hours, based on a 7-day micturition diary. An important secondary endpoint was the change from baseline to end of treatment (week 12) in mean volume voided per micturition. Results for the co-primary endpoints and mean volume voided per micturition for the overall patient population from Study 6 are shown in Table 14.

Figures 9 and 10 show the co-primary endpoints, mean change from baseline (BL) over time in number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours, and mean change from baseline over time in number of micturitions per 24 hours, in the overall patient population in Study 6.

- **Myrbetriq as add-on therapy to solifenacin succinate**: Myrbetriq add-on therapy to solifenacin succinate was evaluated in one 12-week, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled, multicenter clinical trial in incontinent OAB patients who received solifenacin succinate for 4 weeks and required additional relief for their OAB symptoms (Study 7). Entry criteria required that patients had symptoms of OAB for at least 3 months duration (urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency), and at least 1 incontinence episode during a 3-day period after being treated with solifenacin succinate 5 mg for 4 weeks. The majority of patients were Caucasian (94%) and female (83%) with a mean age of 57 years (range 18 to 89 years).

### Do we need more patient-friendly treatment options for overactive bladder (OAB) [^111AfeaN]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2021). Low credibility.

Despite several efficacious treatments for OAB, treatment persistence remains extremely low due to the side effects, risks, and inconvenience of the available options. There is a compelling need for a patient-friendly treatment that is effective, economical, and adaptable to a patient's lifestyle. To determine the feasibility of such an approach, this study evaluated the comfort and tolerability of noninvasive neuromodulation on patients with OAB, as well as their interest in such an approach.

### Treatment of overactive bladder: What is on the horizon [^116y7JaP]. International Urogynecology Journal (2013). Low credibility.

There is still a need to develop additional effective and well-tolerated therapies for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB). The purpose of this review is to discuss alternative therapies for idiopathic OAB that employ a unique mechanism of action or offer a novel application of an existing therapy. We performed a comprehensive literature review to identify alternative therapies and potential future treatments for idiopathic OAB. The use of botulinum toxin for idiopathic OAB is on the rise, and FDA approval will likely be granted in the future.

New innovations in neuromodulation hold the promise of less invasive and more patient-controlled therapies. A number of novel medications, such as β-adrenoreceptor agonists, or medications with alternative indications, such as phosphodiesterase inhibitors, have been identified as potential therapies for OAB. In addition, novel drug delivery systems, such as vaginal inserts, are also in development and may provide an attractive mechanism to deliver medications with proven efficacy.

While conservative measures such as behavioral modification and pelvic floor exercises remain first-line therapy for OAB, anti-muscarinics are the mainstay of medical treatment. For patients with idiopathic OAB refractory to traditional first-line therapies, a number of promising new treatments are on the horizon.

### Updating the evidence on drugs to treat overactive bladder: A systematic review [^113cuMP6]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Fesoterodine 8 mg, which is chemically related to tolterodine, showed greater improvement in incontinence, urgency episodes, and micturition frequency than tolterodine 4 mg. However, fesoterodine appeared to have a worse safety profile with significantly higher incidences of withdrawals due to adverse events, serious adverse events (SAE), constipation, and dry mouth than tolterodine.

Based on one small trial using the overactive bladder symptom score (OABSS), no difference was found between fesoterodine 4 mg and solifenacin 5 mg. Patients who received fesoterodine reported a higher incidence of adverse events of interest, but none reached statistical significance, likely because of the small sample size. Solifenacin 5 mg reduced incontinence and urgency episodes per day by one-half more than tolterodine 4 mg, a significant difference. The overall adverse event profiles are similar between solifenacin and tolterodine, except that solifenacin led to a significantly higher incidence of constipation than tolterodine. Both fesoterodine and solifenacin are more effective than tolterodine, but clinicians should consider solifenacin for its better safety profile compared to fesoterodine.

From the 2012 review, oxybutynin showed comparable improvement of incontinence and micturition frequency to solifenacin 5 mg and tolterodine. The 2012 review did not evaluate patients' assessment of symptoms, though it found no difference between oxybutynin and tolterodine in terms of condition-specific quality of life. Significantly more patients randomized to oxybutynin withdrew because of adverse events than with solifenacin or tolterodine, likely attributing to the medication's tolerability issues.

### Fesoterodine fumarate [^115tG9bB]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The efficacy of fesoterodine fumarate extended-release tablets was evaluated in two Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week studies for the treatment of overactive bladder, characterized by symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency. Entry criteria required patients to have symptoms of overactive bladder for ≥ 6 months, at least 8 micturitions per day, and at least 6 urinary urgency episodes or 3 urge incontinence episodes over a 3-day diary period. Patients were randomized to a fixed dose of fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg/day or 8 mg/day or placebo. In one of these studies, 290 patients were randomized to an active control arm with an oral antimuscarinic agent. For the combined studies, a total of 554 patients received placebo, 554 patients received fesoterodine fumarate 4 mg/day, and 566 patients received fesoterodine fumarate 8 mg/day. The majority of patients were Caucasian (91%) and female (79%), with a mean age of 58 years (range 19 years to 91 years).

- **Primary efficacy endpoints**: The primary efficacy endpoints were the mean change in the number of urge urinary incontinence episodes per 24 hours and the mean change in the number of micturitions (frequency) per 24 hours.

- **Secondary endpoint**: An important secondary endpoint was the mean change in the voided volume per micturition.

### Updating the evidence on drugs to treat overactive bladder: A systematic review [^116mVciz]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

- **Baseline characteristics**: Considering fair- and good-quality RCTs identified in this update, the trial sample size of included populations ranged from 60 to 3080. Trial durations ranged from 4 to 52 weeks, with a median of 12 weeks. Of the 12 trials that reported funding sources, all but one were funded by industry. The mean age of patients was 57.4 years (SD 13.4), with a mean BMI of 28.4. Similar to RCTs included in the 2012 review, patients were predominantly female (77.7%) and White (89.7%).

- **Patient characteristics and symptoms**: UUI was the most common form of OAB (58.6%), followed by mixed incontinence (22.2%) and then OAB without incontinence (19.4%). Patients experienced a mean of 67.4 months of OAB symptoms, and 59.2% had previous pharmacotherapy for OAB. At baseline, patients reported averages of 3 incontinence episodes, 6.1 urgency episodes, and 2.5 UUI episodes per day. As with previously included RCTs, there was a wide range of baseline incontinence episodes per day, ranging from 1.9 to 8.9 episodes per day, with a median of 2.78. Baseline numbers of urgency and UUI episodes were more consistent, with a range of 4.2 to 8.2 urgency episodes and 1.7 to 3.9 UUI episodes per day.

### Trospium chloride [^114jQpXX]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2014). High credibility.

Trospium chloride extended-release capsules were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder who had symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and urge urinary incontinence in two 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. For both studies, entry criteria required the presence of urge incontinence (predominance of urge), at least one incontinence episode per day, and 10 or more micturitions (voids) per day, as assessed by a 3-day urinary diary. Medical history and data from the baseline urinary diary confirmed the diagnosis. Approximately 88% of the patients enrolled completed the 12-week studies. The mean age was 60 years, and the majority of patients were female (84%) and Caucasian (86%).

The co-primary endpoints in the trials were the mean change from baseline to Week 12 in the number of voids per 24 hours (reductions in urinary frequency) and the mean change from baseline to Week 12 in the number of incontinence episodes per 24 hours. Secondary endpoints included the mean change from baseline to Week 12 in volume per void.

- **Study 1**: Included 592 patients in both trospium chloride extended-release capsules 60 mg and placebo groups. As illustrated in Table 4 and Figures 2 and 3, trospium chloride extended-release capsules demonstrated statistically significantly (p < 0.01) greater reductions in urinary frequency and incontinence episodes, and increases in void volume compared to placebo starting at Week 1 and maintained through Weeks 4 and 12.

- **Study 2**: Included 543 patients in both trospium chloride extended-release capsules 60 mg and placebo groups.

### Vesicare [^114UPEno]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2022). High credibility.

VESIcare was evaluated in four twelve-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials for the treatment of overactive bladder in adult patients having symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and/or urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge). Entry criteria required that patients have symptoms of overactive bladder for ≥ 3 months duration. These studies involved 3027 patients (1811 on VESIcare and 1216 on placebo), and approximately 90% of these patients completed the 12-week studies. Two of the four studies evaluated the 5 and 10 mg VESIcare doses (Studies 1 and 2), and the other two evaluated only the 10 mg dose (Studies 3 and 4). All patients completing the 12-week studies were eligible to enter an open-label, long-term extension study (Study 5) and 81% of patients enrolling completed the additional 40-week treatment period. The majority of patients were Caucasian (93%) and female (80%) with a mean age of 58 years.

The primary endpoint in all four trials was the mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in number of micturitions/24 hours. Secondary endpoints included mean change from baseline to 12 weeks in the number of incontinence episodes/24 hours, and mean volume voided per micturition.

The efficacy of VESIcare was similar across patient age groups and gender. The mean reduction in the number of micturitions per 24 hours was significantly greater with VESIcare 5 mg (2.3; p < 0.001) and VESIcare 10 mg (2.7; p < 0.001) compared to placebo (1.4).

### Ibuprofen versus fosfomycin for uncomplicated urinary tract infection in women: Randomised controlled trial [^111gSoAc]. BMJ (2015). High credibility.

- **Secondary outcomes**: All secondary outcomes related to symptoms favored the fosfomycin group. On days 0–4, the total symptom burden (area under the curve) in the ibuprofen group was significantly higher than in the fosfomycin group. The same results were shown when we considered symptoms individually: for each symptom (dysuria, frequency/urgency, abdominal pain), a higher symptom burden on days 0–7 was seen in the ibuprofen group.

With a mean duration of 5.6 days, symptoms lasted about a day longer in the ibuprofen group. On day four, 129 (56%) women in the fosfomycin group versus 91 (39%) in the ibuprofen group were symptom-free (P < 0.001). Up to day seven these rates increased to 82% and 70%, respectively (P < 0.001).

- **Table 3**: Patients without symptoms* on days 1–7, intention to treat population of women with uncomplicated urinary tract infection randomized to ibuprofen or fosfomycin. Figures are numbers (percentage) of women unless stated otherwise.

*Defined as symptom sum score = 0.

Women in the ibuprofen group showed slightly higher scores in impairment of activity — that is, more of their work or regular activities had been impaired by the urinary tract infection. On day seven, 2% of the women…

### Expert panel recommendations on lower urinary tract health of women across their life span [^115idXB6]. Journal of Women's Health (2016). Low credibility.

Pharmacologic treatments are available for the management of urge urinary incontinence (UUI) and overactive bladder (OAB). These include anticholinergic (antimuscarinic) agents such as oxybutynin, tolterodine, trospium chloride, darifenacin, solifenacin, and extended-release fesoterodine. These agents inhibit detrusor overactivity and may impair voiding ability. Due to side effects and high discontinuation rates, anticholinergic agents are often reserved for patients who do not respond to more conservative treatments.

β3-adrenergic agonists represent a newer class of drugs that act on the myogenic detrusor reflex rather than the neurogenic reflex. They inhibit detrusor contractions and may also interfere with bladder filling. OnabotulinumtoxinA (Botox®) is used to inhibit involuntary detrusor contractions, leading to improved continence. More than 70% of patients report at least a 50% reduction in symptoms following treatment, indicating that Botox is relatively effective. Nevertheless, questions remain regarding the duration and durability of its effects, as well as the optimal site for administration (e.g. trigone versus outside the trigone). Additionally, concerns persist about potential muscle damage, toxin accumulation over a lifetime, and the long-term effects of various uses, such as cosmetic and urologic applications, that have yet to be observed.

Currently, there are limited or no pharmacological treatments for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) or underactive bladder (UAB). For instance, bethanechol is a muscarinic agonist used to treat UAB, but there is no level 1 evidence supporting its efficacy.

### Pathophysiology of idiopathic overactive bladder and the success of treatment: A systematic review from ICI-RS 2013 [^113xSEPr]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2014). Low credibility.

The aim of this study is to investigate the frequency of phenotype profiling of patients with idiopathic overactive bladder (OAB) syndrome and to determine the effectiveness of treatment among individuals with different pathophysiologic profiles.

The methods involved searching electronic databases, including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and CINAHL from January 1, 1980, to August 12, 2013, for interventional randomized controlled treatment trials (RCTs) of idiopathic OAB. Phenotyping for pathophysiologies originating in the urothelial/mucosal layer of the bladder, the detrusor muscle cell layer, and the central nervous system were sought. Articles that analyzed urgency outcomes based on pathophysiologic profiling were selected. Due to the heterogeneity of the included interventions and outcome assessment measures, meta-analysis was not appropriate, and a qualitative synthesis was undertaken.

Of the 239 original RCTs on idiopathic OAB, 48 (20%) profiled participants based on underlying pathophysiology. Less than half of these (n = 20) reported treatment efficacy for urgency symptoms by pathophysiological subtype. One study examined the effect of botulinum A toxin on interstitial cell protein expression. Four studies compared treatment efficacy in OAB patients with and without involuntary detrusor contractions. Fifteen studies compared the effect of treatment on urgency reduction in patients with detrusor overactivity. There were no consistent trends in treatment efficacy according to the pathophysiologic subtype. No studies examined urothelial dysfunction or abnormal central processing.

### Updating the evidence on drugs to treat overactive bladder: A systematic review [^115Sri8N]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Low credibility.

Cumulative evidence showed small differences across all comparisons of pharmacotherapies used to treat OAB, including combination therapy (solifenacin/mirabegron) versus monotherapy (< 0.8 episode per day). While some of these differences were statistically significant, the clinical importance is unclear. All treatment groups reported more than one incontinence episode and 2.5 urgency episodes per day at the study's end. For patients with UUI at baseline, less than 65% reported no incontinence over 3 days at the end of treatment.

Anticholinergic adverse effects remain a concern even with mirabegron. Considering that persistence with antimuscarinic drugs is already known to be low, it is unclear whether the added benefit of combining mirabegron with solifenacin outweighs the increased harm. A patient's preference for increased efficacy versus reduced harms and tolerance of specific adverse events should be considered when selecting treatment for OAB.

### Use of third line therapy for overactive bladder in a practice with multiple subspecialty providers-are we doing enough [^115oukiN]. The Journal of Urology (2018). Low credibility.

The purpose of this study was to address overactive bladder, which impacts more than 15% of the adult population. Compliance with medical treatment is low due to inadequate symptom control or intolerable side effects. Although third line therapies have improved the treatment of overactive bladder, many patients do not receive optimal treatment. We hypothesized that third line treatment use is higher among female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery urologists, and we examined its use at our tertiary referral center.

- **Materials and methods**: The electronic medical record was queried for patients with overactive bladder seen in 1 year. We determined the number of visits associated with an overactive bladder prescription and the number of patients who received third line therapy, subcategorized by department. Female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery providers were considered separately.

- **Results**: A total of 5,445 patients (8,994 visits) were seen for overactive bladder. Of all patients seen for overactive bladder, 3.5% received third line therapy compared with 10.0% and 14.1% of those seen by urology providers and female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery providers, respectively.

- **Conclusions**: The use of third line therapy was reported to be less than 5%. This rate is higher at our institution, which is likely due to multiple female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery providers. We also apply an algorithm that facilitates patient education on available options should first and second line treatments fail. Given the limited compliance with medical treatment for overactive bladder, we…

### Refractory overactive bladder: A common problem [^115NvjYr]. International Urogynecology Journal (2015). Low credibility.

Lifestyle interventions and behavioral therapies, which may be combined with antimuscarinic treatment, are recommended in international guidelines as first-line therapy for patients with overactive bladder (OAB). Failure to respond to conservative and pharmacological treatment of OAB has previously been described, but there is considerable heterogeneity in the definitions of both treatment response and nonresponse in trials involving patients with OAB.

Over the last few years, several clinical studies have been published, which investigated different pharmacological principles (e.g. other antimuscarinic drugs, beta-3 agonists, botulinum toxin) and strategies (increasing anticholinergic doses, additional treatment with other anticholinergic drugs, or beta-3 agonists) in the treatment of patients with refractory OAB. The vast majority of these studies report significant improvement of OAB symptoms following a change in treatment.

In this review, we discuss published data concerning factors which may be behind refractory OAB in order to aid in understanding different treatment results in OAB patients.

### Trospium chloride [^115fBaeY]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Trospium chloride was evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder who had symptoms of urinary frequency, urgency, and urge incontinence in two U.S. 12-week, placebo-controlled studies and one 9-month open-label extension.

- **Clinical studies**: Study 1 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in 523 patients. A total of 262 patients received trospium chloride tablets, 20 mg, twice daily, and 261 patients received placebo. The majority of patients were Caucasian (85%) and female (74%), with a mean age of 61 years (range: 21 to 90 years). Entry criteria required that patients have urge or mixed incontinence (with a predominance of urge), urge incontinence episodes of at least 7 per week, and more than 70 micturitions per week. The patient's medical history and urinary diary during the treatment-free baseline confirmed the diagnosis. Reductions in urinary frequency, urge incontinence episodes, and urinary void volume for placebo and trospium chloride treatment groups are summarized in Table 3 and Figures 2 and 3.

### Detrol [^111qcbTf]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2021). High credibility.

Detrol tablets were evaluated for the treatment of overactive bladder with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and frequency in four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week studies. A total of 853 patients received Detrol 2 mg twice daily, and 685 patients received a placebo. The majority of patients were Caucasian (95%) and female (78%), with a mean age of 60 years (range, 19 to 93 years). At study entry, nearly all patients perceived they had urgency, and most patients had increased frequency of micturitions and urge incontinence. These characteristics were well balanced across treatment groups for the studies.

- **Efficacy endpoints for study 007**: The endpoints included the change from baseline for:
	- Number of incontinence episodes per week
	- Number of micturitions per 24 hours (averaged over 7 days)
	- Volume of urine voided per micturition (averaged over 2 days)

### Which anticholinergic drug for overactive bladder symptoms in adults [^117BzDP3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2005). Low credibility.

Around 16% to 45% of adults experience overactive bladder symptoms, which include urgency, frequency, and/or urge incontinence, collectively known as overactive bladder syndrome. Anticholinergic drugs are a common treatment option.

- **Objectives**: To compare the effects of different anticholinergic drugs for overactive bladder symptoms.

- **Search strategy**: We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Group specialised trials register (searched on 17 January 2002) and reference lists of relevant articles. A search for full publications of abstracts identified in January 2002 was completed in July 2003.

- **Selection criteria**: Randomised trials in adults with overactive bladder symptoms or detrusor overactivity that compared one anticholinergic drug with another, or two doses of the same drug.

- **Data collection and analysis**: Two authors independently assessed eligibility, trial quality, and extracted data. Data were processed as described in the Cochrane Reviewers' Handbook.

- **Main results**: Forty-nine trials, including 39 parallel and 10 cross-over designs, were included in the study (11,332 adults). Most trials were described as double-blind, but varied in other aspects of quality. Crossover studies did not present data in a way that could be included in the meta-analysis. Four trials collected quality of life data (the primary outcome measure) using validated measures; none reported usable data. For oxybutynin versus tolterodine: There were no statistically significant differences in patient-perceived improvement, leakage episodes, or voids in 24 hours, but there were fewer withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.57, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.75).

### Myrbetriq [^111hv3XH]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Myrbetriq monotherapy for adult overactive bladder (OAB) was evaluated in three 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multicenter clinical trials involving patients with symptoms of urge urinary incontinence, urgency, and urinary frequency. These studies, known as Studies 1, 2, and 3, required that participants had experienced symptoms of overactive bladder for a minimum duration of three months, with at least eight micturitions per day and a minimum of three episodes of urgency, with or without incontinence, over a three-day period.

The majority of patients in these trials were Caucasian (94%) and female (72%), with a mean age of 59 years (ranging from 18 to 95 years). The population comprised both naïve patients — those who had not previously received muscarinic antagonist pharmacotherapy for overactive bladder (48%) — and those who had received such treatment previously (52%).

- **Study 1 (NCT00689104)**: Patients were randomized to receive placebo, Myrbetriq 50 mg, Myrbetriq 100 mg, or an active control once daily.
- **Study 2 (NCT00662909)**: Patients were randomized to receive placebo, Myrbetriq 50 mg, or Myrbetriq 100 mg once daily.

### Efficacy and safety of solifenacin succinate tablets versus solifenacin succinate tablets with local estrogen for the treatment of overactive bladder in postmenopausal women — a multicenter, randomized, open-label, controlled comparison study [^1144SyA3]. Menopause (2016). Low credibility.

The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness and safety of solifenacin succinate tablets alone or combined with local estrogen for the treatment of overactive bladder in postmenopausal women.

This multicenter, randomized, open, parallel-controlled clinical trial enrolled 104 women between January 2012 and August 2013. Participants meeting the inclusion criteria were randomized 1:1 to 12 weeks of treatment with group A (solifenacin 5 mg qd + promestriene vaginal capsules intravaginally) or group B (solifenacin 5 mg qd). Before and after 12 weeks of treatment, symptoms (urinary urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence) were analyzed. Our primary outcome was the change from baseline to the end of treatment in the mean number of voids in 24 hours. Quality of life (QoL) was assessed using the International Prostate Symptom Score and Overactive Bladder Symptom Score questionnaires and safety according to the incidence of adverse events. The t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare continuous variables, and the χ² test or Fisher's exact test was used to compare categorical variables.

The median decreases in the mean number of voids in 24 hours in groups A and B were 5.2 and 4.3, respectively, which were not significantly different. The median decreases in urgency episodes in groups A and B were 2.0 and 2.5, respectively. In addition, the QoL scores significantly changed in both groups (both P < 0.05). The most common adverse event was dry mouth (19.2% in both groups).

In conclusion, solifenacin with or without local estrogen was effective.

### Long-term safety and efficacy of single-tablet combinations of solifenacin and tamsulosin oral controlled absorption system in men with storage and voiding lower urinary tract symptoms: Results from the NEPTUNE study and NEPTUNE II open-label extension [^116gsjLj]. European Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Short-term trials have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of combination therapy using antimuscarinics and α-blockers in men with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The Study of Solifenacin Succinate and Tamsulosin Hydrochloride OCAS (oral controlled absorption system) in Males with Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (NEPTUNE) II is the first long-term study using solifenacin (Soli) and the oral controlled absorption system formulation of tamsulosin (TOCAS).

- **Objective**: To evaluate long-term (up to 52 weeks) safety and efficacy of flexible dosing of two fixed-dose combinations (FDC) of Soli plus TOCAS in men with moderate to severe storage symptoms and voiding symptoms.

- **Design, setting, and participants**: Patients with both storage and voiding LUTS, maximum urinary flow rate of 4.0–12.0 ml/s, prostate size < 75 ml, and postvoid residuals ≤ 150 ml, who completed the 12-week, double-blind NEPTUNE study could continue in the 40-week, open-label NEPTUNE II study.

- **Intervention**: FDC of Soli 6 mg plus TOCAS 0.4 mg, or Soli 9 mg plus TOCAS 0.4 mg; patients could switch between doses in NEPTUNE II.

- **Outcome measurements and statistical analysis**: Safety and efficacy data from NEPTUNE and NEPTUNE II were combined to cover a 52-week period. Primary efficacy endpoints were total International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and total urgency and frequency score (TUFS); secondary endpoints included IPSS storage and voiding subscores, micturition diary variables, and quality of life parameters.

- **Results**: In all, 1066 men completed NEPTUNE and received one dose or more of study medication.

### Darifenacin [^111zkhCd]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Darifenacin extended-release tablets were evaluated for the treatment of patients with overactive bladder characterized by symptoms of urgency, urge urinary incontinence, and increased urinary frequency. This evaluation was conducted in three randomized, fixed-dose, placebo-controlled, multicenter, double-blind, 12-week studies (Studies 1, 2, and 3) and one randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, dose-titration study (Study 4).

For eligibility in all four studies, patients needed to have had symptoms of overactive bladder for at least six months. They were required to show at least eight micturitions and at least one episode of urinary urgency per day, along with at least five episodes of urge urinary incontinence per week. The majority of participants were white (94%) and female (84%), with a mean age of 58 years, ranging from 19 to 93 years. Thirty-three percent of patients were aged 65 or older. These characteristics were well balanced across the treatment groups.

The study population included both naïve patients who had not previously received pharmacotherapy for overactive bladder (60%) and those who had (40%).

The efficacy data presented in Table 4 was collected from 7- or 14-day voiding diaries in the three fixed-dose placebo-controlled studies involving 1,059 patients treated with placebo, 7.5 mg, or 15 mg of darifenacin once daily for 12 weeks. A significant reduction in the primary endpoint, which was the change from baseline in the average weekly frequency of urge urinary incontinence episodes, was observed across all three studies. Data is also shown for two secondary endpoints: change from baseline in the average number of voids.

### Urinary frequency as a possibly overlooked symptom in COVID-19 patients: Does SARS-CoV-2 cause viral cystitis [^1163QzT9]. European Urology (2020). Low credibility.

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic presents significant challenges for physicians in triaging patients in emergency rooms. We have identified a potentially dangerous overlap between classical urinary symptoms and the not yet fully described symptoms of COVID-19. A case was observed where a patient, initially triaged as having urosepsis, was subsequently diagnosed with COVID-19. This led us to focus on an increase in urinary frequency as a potential symptom of COVID-19, identified in seven males out of 57 patients currently being treated in our COVID-19 wards. In the absence of other causes, urinary frequency may be secondary to viral cystitis due to underlying COVID-19 disease.

We propose considering urinary frequency as an anamnestic tool in patients with infective symptoms. This approach could increase awareness among urologists during the COVID-19 pandemic, thereby preventing the fatal implications of misinterpreting urological symptoms as unrelated to COVID-19.

### Mixed urinary incontinence: Are there effective treatments [^112Kx7oy]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2023). Low credibility.

Although standard treatments for urinary incontinence (UI) benefit some patients, a large unmet medical need remains. Emerging pharmacological treatments seem to offer better risk-benefit profiles than current options, but they are still mainly targeting urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) and overactive bladder. These treatments actively exclude patients with mixed urinary incontinence (MUI) from the development phase. While the development of safe and effective UUI treatments is a worthy endeavor, it does not address the unmet need of patients with MUI, for whom adequate treatment remains a challenge.
