## Question

How does neuropathy pain present

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how neuropathic pain presents. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the formal definition and diagnostic framework to anchor what counts as neuropathic pain. Then, I should verify the core clinical features, distinguishing spontaneous from evoked phenomena. Next, I will examine the negative and positive sensory signs and their neuroanatomic plausibility. After that, I should review common etiologies and exemplar syndromes to illustrate patterns. Finally, I will consider temporal features, severity/burden, and how to grade diagnostic certainty in practice, while double-checking pitfalls and exceptions like mixed pain and nociplastic mechanisms.

> Let me first confirm the definition so I don't misclassify cases. Neuropathic pain is pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system, peripheral or central, and it is distinct from nociceptive pain that originates in non-neural tissues; this is the NeuPSIG/IASP consensus definition and guides the grading system used in research and practice.

> I will now examine the core clinical features. Patients typically report spontaneous ongoing pain such as burning, and paroxysmal electric shock-like sensations, alongside evoked amplified pain responses to normally nonpainful stimuli (allodynia) or exaggerated responses to painful stimuli (hyperalgesia); these features reflect maladaptive peripheral and central sensitization processes after nerve injury or disease [^116EvqjC] [^116jXSdn] [^114Q2wg8].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about "pins and needles" alone. I should confirm the balance of negative versus positive sensory phenomena. Negative signs include numbness, sensory loss, and hyporeflexia indicating axonal loss or conduction block, whereas positive signs include dysesthesias, paresthesias, allodynia, hyperalgesia, and hyperpathia; importantly, positive phenomena can coexist with or even mask negative signs, complicating bedside assessment and reinforcing the need for careful sensory mapping [^1175AKtc] [^116jXSdn] [^114uMhwB].

> Next, I should review distribution and neuroanatomic plausibility. Pain and sensory abnormalities should align with the innervation territory of a named nerve, plexus, root, or central pathway; for example, distal symmetric stocking-glove patterns in polyneuropathy, dermatomal patterns in radiculopathy, and trigeminal branch distributions in trigeminal neuralgia. However, I need to check for extraterritorial spread and overlap, which are not uncommon and can still be consistent with a neuroanatomically plausible lesion [^113o7Wmo] [^112K7WD8] [^112fJZyp].

> Let me consider common etiologies and exemplar presentations to make this concrete. Peripheral causes include diabetic polyneuropathy with burning feet and allodynia, postherpetic neuralgia with persistent burning and allodynia in a dermatomal pattern, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy with glove-stocking dysesthesias, and radiculopathy with shooting leg pain and dermatomal sensory changes; central causes include post-stroke pain, spinal cord injury pain, and multiple sclerosis-related dysesthesias, each with characteristic distributions and associated neurologic deficits [^113JieAf] [^116EvqjC] [^111iT4ob].

> I should double-check temporal features because they refine suspicion. Onset may be immediate after nerve trauma or delayed by weeks to months, as seen after stroke or with insidious diabetic neuropathy; some patients report diurnal variation with worsening toward evening, which can influence dosing strategies and expectations for relief [^113o7Wmo] [^116gMuXn].

> Now, I need to ensure I capture severity and burden accurately. Neuropathic pain is often chronic, moderate to severe, and refractory to conventional analgesics; it impairs sleep, mood, and function, and is associated with higher healthcare utilization and indirect costs, which underscores the need for mechanism-informed, multidisciplinary management and validated patient-reported outcomes [^113JieAf] [^1147KJ5F] [^115eXqb5].

> Next, I should review how we grade diagnostic certainty in practice. The NeuPSIG grading system classifies pain as possible, probable, or definite based on four criteria: a history suggestive of a somatosensory lesion, a neuroanatomically plausible pain distribution, demonstration of sensory signs in the same distribution, and confirmatory testing such as imaging, electrodiagnostics, or skin biopsy; I need to remember that "definite" confirms a lesion explaining the pain but does not prove causality, and that mixed pain states are common, so I must avoid overattribution [^116JJCSf] [^116zHmSD] [^111NDS8V].

> But wait, what if the pain is "more or less neuropathic" rather than binary. I should acknowledge that symptom clusters and clinician certainty often sit on a spectrum, and validated screening tools like DN4, LANSS, and PainDETECT can flag neuropathic features, yet they do not replace a neurologic examination and grading; in complex cases, quantitative sensory testing or microneurography can refine phenotyping, though access varies [^116adLrr] [^11159svb] [^116zHmSD].

> I will now examine special scenarios that commonly confuse diagnosis. Spine-related leg pain illustrates the challenge of distinguishing somatic referred pain, radicular pain without radiculopathy, and painful radiculopathy; many patients with radicular pain lack clear dermatomal distributions or objective sensory loss, so they may only meet "possible" criteria unless imaging or electrodiagnostics upgrade certainty, and even then, mixed pain remains common; similarly, trigeminal neuralgia often lacks sensory signs, so imaging confirmation of vascular compression or demyelination is needed to reach "definite" status [^112K7WD8] [^111SMXxY] [^112fJZyp].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of nociplastic pain so I don't mislabel cases. When pain is widespread, multifocal, persistent, and accompanied by hypersensitivity but lacks evidence of peripheral or central somatosensory lesions, nociplastic pain becomes a more appropriate descriptor; this affects treatment choices, for example, avoiding opioids and emphasizing centrally acting nonpharmacologic strategies, even though some analgesics overlap with neuropathic pain regimens [^111rmTk4].

> Let me reconsider the practical synthesis to ensure nothing is missing. Neuropathic pain presents with a combination of spontaneous ongoing or paroxysmal sensations, evoked allodynia or hyperalgesia, and negative sensory signs in a neuroanatomically plausible distribution, often chronic and refractory, with substantial impact on function and quality of life; diagnosis relies on careful history, sensory examination, and, when needed, confirmatory tests, graded as possible, probable, or definite, while remaining alert to mixed pain and nociplastic mechanisms that can coexist or mimic neuropathic pain [^116EvqjC] [^116JJCSf] [^113JieAf].

---

Neuropathic pain presents with **burning, shooting, or electric shock-like sensations** [^112VvgkG], often accompanied by **allodynia** (pain from light touch) [^116jXSdn] and **hyperalgesia** (exaggerated pain to painful stimuli) [^116jXSdn]. Patients may also report **numbness, tingling, or pins-and-needles** [^111pMTts], and symptoms typically follow a neuroanatomically plausible distribution [^113o7Wmo] (e.g. dermatomal or stocking-glove pattern) [^113o7Wmo]. Diagnosis relies on clinical history, sensory examination, and, when needed, confirmatory tests (e.g. MRI, EMG, skin biopsy) [^116zHmSD] to grade certainty as possible, probable, or definite neuropathic pain [^116JJCSf].

---

## Clinical features and symptoms

Neuropathic pain is characterized by a **distinct set of symptoms** that differentiate it from other pain types:

- **Spontaneous pain**: Ongoing burning, shooting, or electric shock-like sensations [^112VvgkG] are common, often occurring without any external stimulus [^112VvgkG].

- **Evoked pain**: Allodynia (pain from normally non-painful stimuli, such as light touch or clothing) [^116jXSdn] and hyperalgesia (exaggerated pain from normally painful stimuli) [^116jXSdn] are hallmark features.

- **Paresthesia and dysesthesia**: Patients frequently report numbness, tingling, or pins-and-needles sensations [^111pMTts], often described as uncomfortable or unpleasant [^111pMTts].

- **Sleep disturbances and mood changes**: Chronic neuropathic pain often leads to insomnia, anxiety, and depression, significantly impacting quality of life [^113JieAf].

---

## Common descriptors used by patients

Patients with neuropathic pain often use **specific descriptors** to characterize their pain:

| **Descriptor** | **Description** |
|-|-|
| Burning | A constant, searing sensation, often likened to a sunburn [^112VvgkG] |
| Shooting | Sudden, sharp, electric shock-like pains that travel along the nerve pathway [^112VvgkG] |
| Tingling | Pins-and-needles sensation, often associated with numbness [^111pMTts] |
| Electric shock-like | Sudden, intense, brief pains resembling an electric shock [^112VvgkG] |
| Numbness | Loss of sensation, often accompanied by tingling or prickling [^111pMTts] |

---

## Distribution patterns

Neuropathic pain typically follows **neuroanatomically plausible distributions**, reflecting the underlying nerve injury or disease:

- **Peripheral neuropathy**: Often presents in a stocking-glove distribution, affecting the distal extremities symmetrically [^113o7Wmo].

- **Radiculopathy**: Pain radiates along the affected nerve root's dermatomal distribution, often associated with sensory loss or weakness [^113o7Wmo].

- **Trigeminal neuralgia**: Characterized by paroxysmal, electric shock-like facial pain confined to the trigeminal nerve's distribution [^112fJZyp].

---

## Diagnostic criteria and grading system

Diagnosis of neuropathic pain relies on a **combination of clinical assessment and confirmatory tests**. The NeuPSIG grading system classifies neuropathic pain into three levels of certainty:

- **Possible neuropathic pain**: Pain with a neuroanatomically plausible distribution and a history suggestive of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system [^113o7Wmo].

- **Probable neuropathic pain**: Pain with a neuroanatomically plausible distribution and sensory signs (e.g. allodynia, hyperalgesia) confirmed by clinical examination [^116JJCSf].

- **Definite neuropathic pain**: Pain with a neuroanatomically plausible distribution, sensory signs, and confirmatory diagnostic tests (e.g. MRI, EMG, skin biopsy) [^116zHmSD].

---

## Clinical examples

Several **clinical conditions** exemplify the presentation of neuropathic pain:

- **Diabetic neuropathy**: Presents with burning pain, allodynia, and numbness in a stocking-glove distribution, often accompanied by sensory loss and weakness [^111pMTts].

- **Postherpetic neuralgia**: Persistent burning pain following shingles, often with allodynia and hyperalgesia in the affected dermatome [^116EvqjC].

- **Trigeminal neuralgia**: Paroxysmal, electric shock-like facial pain triggered by light touch or chewing [^112fJZyp].

- **Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)**: Severe, burning pain with allodynia, hyperalgesia, and autonomic changes, often following minor injuries [^notfound].

---

## Impact on quality of life

Neuropathic pain significantly impairs quality of life, causing **physical disability, emotional distress, and social isolation** [^113JieAf]. Chronic neuropathic pain is associated with increased healthcare utilization, medication use, and economic burden [^113JieAf].

---

Neuropathic pain presents with **distinctive symptoms** — burning, shooting, or electric shock-like sensations — often accompanied by allodynia and hyperalgesia, and typically following a neuroanatomically plausible distribution. Accurate diagnosis relies on clinical assessment and confirmatory tests, and the condition significantly impacts quality of life.

### Unmet needs in the management of neuropathic pain [^113BY5gW]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2003). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain is a challenging condition to treat. It is heterogeneous in nature and largely resistant to treatment with commonly prescribed analgesics. Current management strategies fail to achieve adequate or satisfactory pain relief in a high proportion of patients. The four main reasons that treatments for neuropathic pain fail are: inadequate diagnosis and a lack of appreciation of the mechanisms involved; insufficient management of comorbid conditions; incorrect understanding or selection of treatment options; and the use of inappropriate outcomes measures. These unmet needs in the current management of neuropathic pain are reviewed in this article. The review focuses on the need for a methodical and mechanistic approach to diagnosis, and a flexible, interdisciplinary approach to treatment of neuropathic pain conditions, in order to improve pain relief and quality of life in patients with neuropathic pain.

### Advances and challenges in neuropathic pain: a narrative review and future directions [^116pquyd]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2023). Medium credibility.

Over the past few decades, substantial advances have been made in neuropathic pain clinical research. An updated definition and classification have been agreed. Validated questionnaires have improved the detection and assessment of acute and chronic neuropathic pain; and newer neuropathic pain syndromes associated with COVID-19 have been described. The management of neuropathic pain has moved from empirical to evidence-based medicine. However, appropriately targeting current medications and the successful clinical development of drugs acting on new targets remain challenging. Innovative approaches to improving therapeutic strategies are required. These mainly encompass rational combination therapy, drug repurposing, non-pharmacological approaches (such as neurostimulation techniques), and personalised therapeutic management. This narrative review reports historical and current perspectives regarding the definitions, classification, assessment, and management of neuropathic pain and explores potential avenues for future research.

### The clinical challenge of chronic neuropathic pain [^116G4yAK]. Disability and Rehabilitation (2006). Low credibility.

Background

The clinician often faces the problem that certain types of chronic pains remain refractory to the commonly used analgesic treatment options. Neuropathic pain, which is defined as pain caused by direct nerve lesions, may have different causes and a variety of clinical presentations. A correct management of chronic neuropathic pain requires a thorough understanding of the potential causes, the diagnosis and the pathophysiological mechanisms.

Objectives

The purpose of this review article is to provide the reader with the latest insights in the diagnostic work-out and the clinical presentation of neuropathic pain. Additionally, the possible pathophysiological changes induced by nerve lesions are explained.

Methods

An extensive literature review was performed using Pubmed citations.

Results and Conclusions

This article, which is based on extensive literature review, aims at providing a concise review of the current knowledge regarding aetiology, diagnosis and pathophysiology of neuropathic pain.

### Osteoarthritis pain: nociceptive or neuropathic? [^111gKK65]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2014). Medium credibility.

In this article, we present the case for the existence of a subgroup of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) who experience pain with neuropathic features. Recognizing these patients as a distinct subgroup will allow clinicians to improve the management of their symptoms. We discuss the diagnostic criteria for pain to be classed as neuropathic, then systematically examine the applicability of these criteria to the symptoms, signs and pathology of OA. What are the implications for the preclinical development and clinical use of analgesics for OA? How should existing treatment options be reassessed? Differences in the aetiology of OA and the pharmacological sensitivity of patients with OA pain with neuropathic features, compared with other patients with OA, might explain the frequent negative findings of clinical trials of treatments for symptomatic OA. If the global prevalence of OA pain with neuropathic features is accurately represented by reports from small experimental groups of patients, then a substantial unmet need to tailor diagnosis and therapy for these individuals exists.

### Neuroimaging of neuropathic pain: review of current status and future directions [^116YxAML]. Neurosurgical Review (2018). Low credibility.

The goal of this review is to discuss the various imaging modalities to study neuropathic pain and its future implication in understanding pain network, for the diagnosis and management of patients with chronic neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is characterized by pain secondary to lesions or dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS) or the peripheral nervous system. Neuropathic pain is generally chronic and disabling, and responds poorly to conventional treatment. Although our understanding of the imaging changes in chronic pain state is evolving, we still face practical challenges in implementing these finding to objectively diagnose and follow treatment response in patients with chronic pain and to guide targeted and individualized treatment to each chronic pain condition.

### Mechanisms of disease: mechanism-based classification of neuropathic pain-a critical analysis [^112f5xFE]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

Classification of neuropathic pain according to etiology or localization has clear limitations. The discovery of specific molecular and cellular events following experimental nerve injury has raised the possibility of classifying neuropathic pain on the basis of the underlying neurobiological mechanisms. Application of this approach in the clinic is problematic, however, owing to a lack of precise tools to assess symptoms and signs, and difficulties in correlating symptoms and signs with mechanisms. Development and validation of diagnostic methods to identify mechanisms, together with pharmacological agents that specifically target these mechanisms, seems to be the most logical and rational way of improving neuropathic pain treatment.

### Neuropathic pain: diagnosis, pathophysiological mechanisms, and treatment [^116EvqjC]. The Lancet: Neurology (2010). Medium credibility.

Neuropathic pain develops as a result of lesions or disease affecting the somatosensory nervous system either in the periphery or centrally. Examples of neuropathic pain include painful polyneuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, and post-stroke pain. Clinically, neuropathic pain is characterised by spontaneous ongoing or shooting pain and evoked amplified pain responses after noxious or non-noxious stimuli. Methods such as questionnaires for screening and assessment focus on the presence and quality of neuropathic pain. Basic research is enabling the identification of different pathophysiological mechanisms, and clinical assessment of symptoms and signs can help to determine which mechanisms are involved in specific neuropathic pain disorders. Management of neuropathic pain requires an interdisciplinary approach, centred around pharmacological treatment. A better understanding of neuropathic pain and, in particular, of the translation of pathophysiological mechanisms into sensory signs will lead to a more effective and specific mechanism-based treatment approach.

### Diagnosis and treatment of neuropathic pain [^112LiBq9]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2003). Low credibility.

Currently, no consensus on the optimal management of neuropathic pain exists and practices vary greatly worldwide. Possible explanations for this include difficulties in developing agreed diagnostic protocols and the coexistence of neuropathic, nociceptive and, occasionally, idiopathic pain in the same patient. Also, neuropathic pain has historically been classified according to its etiology (e.g., painful diabetic neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, spinal cord injury) without regard for the presumed mechanism(s) underlying the specific symptoms. A combined etiologic/mechanistic classification might improve neuropathic pain management. The treatment of neuropathic pain is largely empirical, often relying heavily on data from small, generally poorly-designed clinical trials or anecdotal evidence. Consequently, diverse treatments are used, including non-invasive drug therapies (antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs and membrane stabilizing drugs), invasive therapies (nerve blocks, ablative surgery), and alternative therapies (e.g., acupuncture). This article reviews the current and historical practices in the diagnosis and treatment of neuropathic pain, and focuses on the USA, Europe and Japan.

### Neuropathic pain: redefinition and a grading system for clinical and research purposes [^116RQd13]. Neurology (2008). Low credibility.

Pain usually results from activation of nociceptive afferents by actually or potentially tissue-damaging stimuli. Pain may also arise by activity generated within the nervous system without adequate stimulation of its peripheral sensory endings. For this type of pain, the International Association for the Study of Pain introduced the term neuropathic pain, defined as "pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction in the nervous system". While this definition has been useful in distinguishing some characteristics of neuropathic and nociceptive types of pain, it lacks defined boundaries. Since the sensitivity of the nociceptive system is modulated by its adequate activation (e.g., by central sensitization), it has been difficult to distinguish neuropathic dysfunction from physiologic neuroplasticity. We present a more precise definition developed by a group of experts from the neurologic and pain community: pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system. This revised definition fits into the nosology of neurologic disorders. The reference to the somatosensory system was derived from a wide range of neuropathic pain conditions ranging from painful neuropathy to central poststroke pain. Because of the lack of a specific diagnostic tool for neuropathic pain, a grading system of definite, probable, and possible neuropathic pain is proposed. The grade possible can only be regarded as a working hypothesis, which does not exclude but does not diagnose neuropathic pain. The grades probable and definite require confirmatory evidence from a neurologic examination. This grading system is proposed for clinical and research purposes.

### Neuropathic pain in the community: more under-treated than refractory? [^114zscoe]. Pain (2013). Low credibility.

Summary

There is a significant proportion of chronic pain that is persistent and neuropathic, appears undertreated or untreated, and is associated with poor health and quality of life.

### Neuropathic pain phenotyping by international consensus (neuroPPIC) for genetic studies: a neuPSIG systematic review, Delphi survey, and expert panel recommendations [^116hoVk8]. Pain (2015). Low credibility.

The need for a consensus-based, rather than purely evidence-based approach to phenotyping neuropathic pain for genetic studies reflects the absence of "gold standards" for both case definition (what is neuropathic pain?) and case attribution (how do we know who has neuropathic pain?). Through a process of systematic literature review, Delphi survey, and expert consensus meeting, we have identified an agreed "entry level" approach to phenotyping cases and controls for studies of genetic associations with neuropathic pain in adults. This phenotype is based on establishing the presence or absence of "possible" neuropathic pain, according to the most internationally agreed system for classifying neuropathic pain clinically. This uses validated symptom-based screening tools and a body chart or checklist to determine neuroanatomical relevance. Further details, also collected by questionnaire, include pain history (duration, intensity, and formal diagnoses) and demographic information (Box 1). We present this "entry level" approach as the minimum phenotyping standard for genetic association studies on neuropathic pain in adults, with the expectation that more extensive phenotyping should build on this "entry level" approach, as required and as resources allow. Adoption of these NeuroPPIC phenotyping guidelines will facilitate comparison and collaboration between researchers, including replication studies and meta-analyses. The guidelines are applicable to different types of genetic studies of neuropathic pain, from targeted studies interrogating a few genetic loci that use specific neuropathic pain traits to hypothesis-free genome-wide studies with large sample sizes. They will also apply to studies with a larger array of phenotypes, including more detailed pain traits, psychosocial traits, and pharmacological screens. Our systematic review identified the lack of a consistent approach to phenotyping neuropathic pain, poor reporting of phenotyping methodologies, and failure to adequately describe control groups (especially when "healthy controls" were used). These limitations are likely to have contributed to inconsistent and nonreplicated findings, and highlight the need for the NeuroPPIC process we have completed.

### Advances in neuropathic pain… [^114Q2wg8]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

A proposed solution is to define neuropathic pain as pain caused by a lesion of the peripheral or central nervous system manifesting with sensory symptoms and signs. 6 Underlying causes include infections, trauma, metabolic abnormalities, chemotherapy, surgery, irradiation, neurotoxins, inherited neurodegeneration, nerve compression, inflammation, and tumor infiltration. For example, pinprick may be more painful but less sharp because of the underlying sensory deficit. An increased sensation of pain in response to a normally painful stimulus is termed hyperalgesia, which can be assessed using painful thermal or punctate stimuli. Painful summation and hyperpathia to repeated stimuli, especially when the initial sensation is reduced, is important evidence of abnormal sensory processing.

A simple focal peripheral nerve injury unleashes a range of peripheral and central nervous system processes that can all contribute to persistent pain and abnormal sensation. Inflammation, reparatory mechanisms of neural tissues in response to injury, and the reaction of adjacent tissues to injury lead to a state of hyperexcitability in primary afferent nociceptors, a phenomenon termed peripheral sensitization. In turn, central neurons innervated by such nociceptors undergo dramatic functional changes including a state of hyperexcitability termed central sensitization. Normally these sensitization phenomena extinguish themselves as the tissue heals and inflammation subsides. However, when primary afferent function is altered in an enduring way by injury or disease of the nervous system, these processes persist and may be highly resistant to treatment.

Injury or permanent loss of primary afferent fibers differentiates peripheral neuropathic pain from other types of pain. Positive sensory phenomena that are characteristic of patients with neuropathic pain are likely to have many underlying mechanisms, including ectopic generation of impulses as well as the de novo expression of neurotransmitters and their receptors and ion channels. An oversimplified but useful approach is to distinguish processes that involve the following: increased primary afferent nociceptor firing; decreased inhibition of neuronal activity in central structures; and altered central processing so that normal sensory input is amplified and sustained.

### Chronic pain: physiological, diagnostic, and management considerations [^117UieWE]. The Psychiatric Clinics of North America (2005). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain is a neuropsychiatric condition in which pain is initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction in the nervous system. Understanding the complexity of neuropathic pain becomes the cornerstone for appropriate diagnosis and management. Diagnosis must take into account comorbid conditions. Successful management depends on realistic patient and physician expectations and an individualized, multidisciplinary approach.

### From data to decision: critical appraisal of the 2025 neuPSIG review and recommendations on neuropathic pain treatments [^114NF7GX]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2025). Medium credibility.

The 2025 recommendations of the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group (NeuPSIG) constitute a methodologically rigorous update on the management of neuropathic pain, integrating a large-scale meta-analysis of pharmacological treatments and neuromodulation intervention. Yet, they also expose persistent challenges: under-representation of common aetiologies, a narrow scope of neuromodulation, reliance on placebo-controlled designs, and conflicts of interest that might affect the perception of neutrality. Addressing these issues requires not only transparency, but also broader inclusion of neglected conditions, adaptation of methods to nonpharmacological interventions, and attention to diverse healthcare contexts. We aim to both to critically appraise the current guidelines and to encourage broader reflection on how future research and guideline development could foster greater relevance and generalisation.

### Deconstructing the neuropathic pain phenotype to reveal neural mechanisms [^114Ldkv3]. Neuron (2012). Low credibility.

After nerve injury maladaptive changes can occur in injured sensory neurons and along the entire nociceptive pathway within the CNS, which may lead to spontaneous pain or pain hypersensitivity. The resulting neuropathic pain syndromes present as a complex combination of negative and positive symptoms, which vary enormously from individual to individual. This variation depends on a diversity of underlying pathophysiological changes resulting from the convergence of etiological, genotypic, and environmental factors. The pain phenotype can serve therefore, as a window on underlying pathophysiological neural mechanisms and as a guide for developing personalized pain medicine.

### Allodynia and hyperalgesia in neuropathic pain: clinical manifestations and mechanisms [^116jXSdn]. The Lancet: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Allodynia (pain due to a stimulus that does not usually provoke pain) and hyperalgesia (increased pain from a stimulus that usually provokes pain) are prominent symptoms in patients with neuropathic pain. Both are seen in various peripheral neuropathies and central pain disorders, and affect 15–50% of patients with neuropathic pain. Allodynia and hyperalgesia are classified according to the sensory modality (touch, pressure, pinprick, cold, and heat) that is used to elicit the sensation. Peripheral sensitisation and maladaptive central changes contribute to the generation and maintenance of these reactions, with separate mechanisms in different subtypes of allodynia and hyperalgesia. Pain intensity and relief are important measures in clinical pain studies, but might be insufficient to capture the complexity of the pain experience. Better understanding of allodynia and hyperalgesia might provide clues to the underlying pathophysiology of neuropathic pain and, as such, they represent new or additional endpoints in pain trials.

### Neuropathic pain: an updated grading system for research and clinical practice [^116JJCSf]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

6. Conclusions

Neuropathic pain is a term used for a group of conditions with a wide range of causes and different pain distributions. However, all these conditions are characterized by a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory nervous system peripherally or centrally. The grading system represents a tool to determine the level of certainty that the pain in an individual is neuropathic in nature. Such grading is naturally based on clinical judgment. Therefore, it relies heavily on the experience, skills, and resources available for assessment.

We anticipate that the rephrasing and reordering of the 4 criteria of the grading system will facilitate its use by both neurologists and non-neurologists. The level "probable" should usually be sufficient to initiate treatment according to neuropathic pain guidelines. The level "definite" is useful in specialist contexts and when a causal treatment of the underlying lesion or disease is an option. In some cases, sensory signs in the painful area may be difficult to demonstrate, although the nature of the lesion or disease is confirmed (eg, trigeminal neuralgia, channelopathies, postherpetic neuralgia); for these cases, the level "probable" continues to be appropriate if a diagnostic test confirms the lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system.

This paper includes an update of the grading system published in 2008. The goal of this update is to provide a revised grading system that is clinically useful, internally consistent, and allows appropriate treatment decisions in the face of uncertainty. We anticipate that the revised grading system will be incorporated into the "content model" of neuropathic pain in the upcoming 11th version of the International Classification of Diseases. We have also identified a range of important research topics that will further improve the classification and grading of neuropathic pain in the future.

### Reappraising neuropathic pain in humans – how symptoms help disclose mechanisms [^112VvgkG]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2013). Medium credibility.

Neuropathic pain — that is, pain arising directly from a lesion or disease that affects the somatosensory system — is a common clinical problem, and typically causes patients intense distress. Patients with neuropathic pain have sensory abnormalities on clinical examination and experience pain of diverse types, some spontaneous and others provoked. Spontaneous pain typically manifests as ongoing burning pain or paroxysmal electric shock-like sensations. Provoked pain includes pain induced by various stimuli or even gentle brushing (dynamic mechanical allodynia). Recent clinical and neurophysiological studies suggest that the various pain types arise through distinct pathophysiological mechanisms. Ongoing burning pain primarily reflects spontaneous hyperactivity in nociceptive-fibre pathways, originating from 'irritable' nociceptors, regenerating nerve sprouts or denervated central neurons. Paroxysmal sensations can be caused by several mechanisms; for example, electric shock-like sensations probably arise from high-frequency bursts generated in demyelinated non-nociceptive Aβ fibres. Most human and animal findings suggest that brush-evoked allodynia originates from Aβ fibres projecting onto previously sensitized nociceptive neurons in the dorsal horn, with additional contributions from plastic changes in the brainstem and thalamus. Here, we propose that the emerging mechanism-based approach to the study of neuropathic pain might aid the tailoring of therapy to the individual patient, and could be useful for drug development.

### Tramadol for neuropathic pain in adults [^114LBWVx]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

This review is an update of a review of tramadol for neuropathic pain, published in 2006; updating was to bring the review in line with current standards. Neuropathic pain, which is caused by a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system, may be central or peripheral in origin. Peripheral neuropathic pain often includes symptoms such as burning or shooting sensations, abnormal sensitivity to normally painless stimuli, or an increased sensitivity to normally painful stimuli. Neuropathic pain is a common symptom in many diseases of the peripheral nervous system.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy of tramadol compared with placebo or other active interventions for chronic neuropathic pain in adults, and the adverse events associated with its use in clinical trials.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase for randomised controlled trials from inception to January 2017. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and online clinical trial registries.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials of two weeks' duration or longer, comparing tramadol (any route of administration) with placebo or another active treatment for neuropathic pain, with subjective pain assessment by the participant.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality and potential bias. Primary outcomes were participants with substantial pain relief (at least 50% pain relief over baseline or very much improved on Patient Global Impression of Change scale (PGIC)), or moderate pain relief (at least 30% pain relief over baseline or much or very much improved on PGIC). Where pooled analysis was possible, we used dichotomous data to calculate risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) or harmful outcome (NNH), using standard methods. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE and created 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We identified six randomised, double-blind studies involving 438 participants with suitably characterised neuropathic pain. In each, tramadol was started at a dose of about 100 mg daily and increased over one to two weeks to a maximum of 400 mg daily or the maximum tolerated dose, and then maintained for the remainder of the study. Participants had experienced moderate or severe neuropathic pain for at least three months due to cancer, cancer treatment, postherpetic neuralgia, peripheral diabetic neuropathy, spinal cord injury, or polyneuropathy. The mean age was 50 to 67 years with approximately equal numbers of men and women. Exclusions were typically people with other significant comorbidity or pain from other causes. Study duration for treatments was four to six weeks, and two studies had a cross-over design. Not all studies reported all the outcomes of interest, and there were limited data for pain outcomes. At least 50% pain intensity reduction was reported in three studies (265 participants, 110 events). Using a random-effects analysis, 70/132 (53%) had at least 50% pain relief with tramadol, and 40/133 (30%) with placebo; the risk ratio (RR) was 2.2 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02 to 4.6). The NNT calculated from these data was 4.4 (95% CI 2.9 to 8.8). We downgraded the evidence for this outcome by two levels to low quality because of the small size of studies and of the pooled data set, because there were only 110 actual events, the analysis included different types of neuropathic pain, the studies all had at least one high risk of potential bias, and because of the limited duration of the studies. Participants experienced more adverse events with tramadol than placebo. Report of any adverse event was higher with tramadol (58%) than placebo (34%) (4 studies, 266 participants, 123 events; RR 1.6 (95% CI 1.2 to 2.1); NNH 4.2 (95% CI 2.8 to 8.3)). Adverse event withdrawal was higher with tramadol (16%) than placebo (3%) (6 studies, 485 participants, 45 events; RR 4.1 (95% CI 2.0 to 8.4); NNH 8.2 (95% CI 5.8 to 14)). Only four serious adverse events were reported, without obvious attribution to treatment, and no deaths were reported. We downgraded the evidence for this outcome by two or three levels to low or very low quality because of small study size, because there were few actual events, and because of the limited duration of the studies.

Authors' Conclusions

There is only modest information about the use of tramadol in neuropathic pain, coming from small, largely inadequate studies with potential risk of bias. That bias would normally increase the apparent benefits of tramadol. The evidence of benefit from tramadol was of low or very low quality, meaning that it does not provide a reliable indication of the likely effect, and the likelihood is very high that the effect will be substantially different from the estimate in this systematic review.

### Revised definition of neuropathic pain and its grading system: an open case series illustrating its use in clinical practice [^1127AKJe]. The American Journal of Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The definition of neuropathic pain has recently been revised by an expert committee of the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group of the International Association for the Study of Pain (NeuPSIG) as "pain arising as direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system", and a grading system of "definite", "probable", and "possible" neuropathic pain has been introduced. This open case series of 5 outpatients (3 men, 2 women; mean age 48 ± 12 years) demonstrates how the grading system can be applied, in combination with appropriate confirmatory testing, to diagnosis neuropathic conditions in clinical practice. The proposed grading system includes a dynamic algorithm that enhances the physician's ability to determine with a greater level of certainty whether a pain condition is neuropathic. Its clinical use should be further validated in prospective studies.

### Neuropathic pain in the community: more under-treated than refractory? [^111No1Ew]. Pain (2013). Low credibility.

1 Introduction

Neuropathic pain was recently re-defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) and graded as "possible", "probable", or "definite", depending on the extent and results of neurological assessment. Best current estimates of the population prevalence of neuropathic pain come from studies using validated screening tools that detect pain with possible neuropathic features. Chronic pain with neuropathic features has been shown to affect around 7–8% of the general population. The proportion of these meeting the IASP classification of "possible" neuropathic pain, therefore requiring consideration of specific treatment or further assessment, is unknown. Similarly, the proportion experiencing significant, long-term neuropathic pain, not responding to standard treatment, is unknown, though this is perhaps the most clinically important and challenging subgroup.

The term "refractory neuropathic pain" has emerged in recent literature, and definitions and descriptions vary markedly. In a review of the epidemiology of refractory neuropathic pain, Taylor (2006) included specific neuropathic pain conditions and pain that was "persistent". The Scottish Medicines Consortium describes patients with refractory neuropathic pain, as those who "have not achieved adequate pain relief from, or have not tolerated, conventional first and second line treatments". A more detailed definition was developed for use in a randomised controlled trial of a new drug regimenand includes specific criteria related to duration of refractory neuropathic pain for at least 6 months, pain severity score of at least 40 mm on a 0–100 mm visual analogue scale, and nonresponse to usual care, including treatment with gabapentin, a tricyclic antidepressant, and a third potentially effective medication. Hansson et al. (2009) proposed a definition of "pharmacoresistant neuropathic pain" that would incorporate resistance to proven efficacious drugs, of appropriate duration, and with adequate dosage. The authors concede that data are lacking to support an evidence-based approach to the definition of these terms and call for more studies and debate.

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^116f6AJv]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

Definite neuropathic pain is reached if all the above criteria are present, plus a diagnostic test confirming a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system explaining the pain.

It is recommended that the presence of probable or definite neuropathic pain prompt consideration of treatment according to the neuropathic pain treatment guidelines. Currently, in the context of spine-related leg pain, however, there is little evidence that neuropathic pain medications are effective. However, very few trials actually mandated the presence of neuropathic pain as an inclusion criterion, meaning we cannot preclude heterogeneity in case definitions, further confounding/complicating the interpretation of true efficacy. Other studies used underpowered (post hoc) subgroup analyses. Future research is required to determine whether neuropathic pain medications are effective in patients with spine-related leg pain with neuropathic characteristics and clarification of outcomes may in part be facilitated by the use of specific case definitions, as proposed in this paper. In the absence of clear evidence for efficacy in pharmacological treatment, targeted management strategies for people with neuropathic pain would still be distinct from those with nociceptive pain, for instance, related to explanations, education, and sense making. As such, the grading system classification has direct clinical implications for care recommendations including in spine-related leg pain.

### Neuropathic pain in the general population: a systematic review of epidemiological studies [^114k7byv]. Pain (2014). Low credibility.

Most patients with neuropathic pain symptoms present and are managed in primary care, with only a minority being referred for specialist clinical assessment and diagnoses. Previous reviews have focused mainly on specific neuropathic pain conditions based in specialist settings. This is the first systematic review of epidemiological studies of neuropathic pain in the general population. Electronic databases were searched from January 1966 to December 2012, and studies were included where the main focus was on neuropathic pain prevalence and/or incidence, either as part of a specific neuropathic pain-related condition or as a global entity in the general population. We excluded studies in which data were extracted from pain or other specialist clinics or focusing on specific population subgroups. Twenty-one articles were identified and underwent quality assessment and data extraction. Included studies differed in 3 main ways: method of data retrieval, case ascertainment tool used, and presentation of prevalence/incidence rates. This heterogeneity precluded any meta-analysis. We categorised comparable incidence and prevalence rates into 2 main subgroups: (1) chronic pain with neuropathic characteristics (range 3–17%), and (2) neuropathic pain associated with a specific condition, including postherpetic neuralgia (3.9–42.0/100,000 person-years [PY]), trigeminal neuralgia (12.6–28.9/100,000 PY), painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (15.3–72.3/100,000 PY), glossopharyngeal neuralgia (0.2–0.4/100,000 PY). These differences highlight the importance of a standardised approach for identifying neuropathic pain in future epidemiological studies. A best estimate of population prevalence of pain with neuropathic characteristics is likely to lie between 6.9% and 10%.

### Neuropathic pain: an updated grading system for research and clinical practice [^111NPUWK]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

The redefinition of neuropathic pain as "pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system", which was suggested by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) Special Interest Group on Neuropathic Pain (NeuPSIG) in 2008, has been widely accepted. In contrast, the proposed grading system of possible, probable, and definite neuropathic pain from 2008 has been used to a lesser extent. Here, we report a citation analysis of the original NeuPSIG grading paper of 2008, followed by an analysis of its use by an expert panel and recommendations for an improved grading system. As of February, 2015, 608 eligible articles in Scopus cited the paper, 414 of which cited the neuropathic pain definition. Of 220 clinical studies citing the paper, 56 had used the grading system. The percentage using the grading system increased from 5% in 2009 to 30% in 2014. Obstacles to a wider use of the grading system were identified, including (1) questions about the relative significance of confirmatory tests, (2) the role of screening tools, and (3) uncertainties about what is considered a neuroanatomically plausible pain distribution. Here, we present a revised grading system with an adjusted order, better reflecting clinical practice, improvements in the specifications, and a word of caution that even the "definite" level of neuropathic pain does not always indicate causality. In addition, we add a table illustrating the area of pain and sensory abnormalities in common neuropathic pain conditions and propose areas for further research.

### Mechanisms of disease: neuropathic pain – a clinical perspective [^112iDoAG]. Nature Clinical Practice: Neurology (2006). Medium credibility.

Neuropathic pain syndromes-pain after a lesion or disease of the peripheral or central nervous system-are clinically characterized by spontaneous and evoked types of pain, which are underpinned by various distinct pathophysiological mechanisms in the peripheral and central nervous systems. In some patients, the nerve lesion triggers molecular changes in nociceptive neurons, which become abnormally sensitive and develop pathological spontaneous activity. Inflammatory reactions of the damaged nerve trunk can induce ectopic nociceptor activity, causing spontaneous pain. The hyperactivity in nociceptors induces secondary changes in processing neurons in the spinal cord and brain, so that input from mechanoreceptive A-fibers is perceived as pain. Neuroplastic changes in the central pain modulatory systems can lead to further hyperexcitability. The treatment of neuropathic pain is still unsatisfactory, and a new hypothetical concept has been proposed, in which pain is analyzed on the basis of underlying mechanisms. The increased knowledge of pain-generating mechanisms and their translation into symptoms and signs might eventually allow a dissection of the mechanisms that operate in each patient. If a precise clinical phenotypic characterization of the neuropathic pain is combined with a selection of drugs that act on those mechanisms, it should ultimately be possible to design optimal treatments for individuals. This review discusses the conceptual framework of the novel mechanism-based classification, encouraging the reader to see neuropathic pain as a clinical entity rather than a compilation of single disease states.

1 INTRODUCTION

Peripheral neuropathic pain is a common finding in patients with peripheral nerve injury. It has been defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as a pain "caused by lesions or diseases of the somatosensory nervous system". Peripheral neuropathic pain is typically chronic in nature and is caused by a heterogenous group of diseases. It has an estimated prevalence of between 6.9% and 10% of the population. It is typically described as a "pins and needles", burning, cramping, or tingling pain by patients. Prior research has demonstrated that neuropathic causes of pain may be underrecognized and inadequately managed. In this review, we seek to briefly outline the mechanisms of peripheral neuropathic pain and provide a comprehensive list of non‐interventional treatment approaches.

### Advances in understanding nociception and neuropathic pain [^111R8Skz]. Journal of Neurology (2018). Low credibility.

Pain results from the activation of a subset of sensory neurones termed nociceptors and has evolved as a "detect and protect" mechanism. However, lesion or disease in the sensory system can result in neuropathic pain, which serves no protective function. Understanding how the sensory nervous system works and what changes occur in neuropathic pain are vital in identifying new therapeutic targets and developing novel analgesics. In recent years, technologies such as optogenetics and RNA-sequencing have been developed, which alongside the more traditional use of animal neuropathic pain models and insights from genetic variations in humans have enabled significant advances to be made in the mechanistic understanding of neuropathic pain.

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^116qHn5p]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

4.1. Classification of neuropathic pain for different subgroups of spine-related leg pain

In the initial survey of the working group members, there was broad agreement on the classification of 2 of the 3 terms regarding the likelihood of having neuropathic pain: somatic referred pain (probably not or definitely not) and painful radiculopathy (probably or definitely) (Fig. 4). The working group members concorded that neuropathic pain may be a feature in radiculopathy.

Figure 4.
Panel ratings on the likely presence of neuropathic pain in various presentations of spine-related leg pain (6-point Likert scale from definitely to unsure).

The panel discussed at length whether radicular pain should be classified as neuropathic pain or not, and initially, a consensus was not reached. One strategy posed to the panel to facilitate further discussion was to simply ask the fundamental question; "is there neuropathic pain or not in a person presenting with spine-related leg pain?" The fundamental question is posed agnostic to terminology and case definitions in the first instance, thereby bypassing the forced attribution of neuropathic pain to a specific term (eg, radicular). Such an approach does not compromise the application of the neuropathic pain grading system to clinical pain conditions but rather focuses on attributing the classification of neuropathic pain to the presentation rather than to a specific terminology.

By applying this strategy, the panel was able to reach consensus on the following recommendations:

4.1.1. Somatic-referred pain

Somatic-referred pain does not meet the current grading system criteria for classification as neuropathic pain. The history (eg, reason for symptom onset such as muscle strain and pain descriptors) is not indicative of a nerve lesion, and diagnostic tests do not confirm the presence of a nerve lesion. Sensory signs may at times be present, but with varying borders and characteristics, and they do not follow clear neuroanatomical distributions. This does not preclude the coexistence of neuropathic pain in association with a comorbid pain condition (eg, a painful radiculopathy). In this case, although, neuropathic pain would not be attributable to somatic-referred pain but rather to the comorbid neuropathic condition.

### The concept of nociplastic pain-where to from here? [^111rmTk4]. Pain (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Nociplastic pain, a third mechanistic pain descriptor in addition to nociceptive and neuropathic pain, was adopted in 2017 by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP). It is defined as "pain that arises from altered nociception" not fully explained by nociceptive or neuropathic pain mechanisms. Peripheral and/or central sensitization, manifesting as allodynia and hyperalgesia, is typically present, although not specific for nociplastic pain. Criteria for possible nociplastic pain manifesting in the musculoskeletal system define a minimum of 4 conditions: (1) pain duration of more than 3 months; (2) regional, multifocal or widespread rather than discrete distribution of pain; (3) pain cannot entirely be explained by nociceptive or neuropathic mechanisms; and (4) clinical signs of pain hypersensitivity present in the region of pain. Educational endeavors and field testing of criteria are needed. Pharmacological treatment guidelines, based on the three pain types, need to be developed. Currently pharmacological treatments of nociplastic pain resemble those of neuropathic; however, opioids should be avoided. A major challenge is to unravel pathophysiological mechanisms driving altered nociception in patients suffering from nociplastic pain. Examples from fibromyalgia would include pathophysiology of the peripheral as well as central nervous system, such as autoreactive antibodies acting at the level of the dorsal root ganglia and aberrant cerebral pain processing, including altered brain network architecture. Understanding pathophysiological mechanisms and their interactions is a prerequisite for the development of diagnostic tests allowing for individualized treatments and development of new strategies for prevention and treatment.

### Diagnosis and assessment of neuropathic pain through questionnaires [^11159svb]. The Lancet: Neurology (2018). Medium credibility.

Neuropathic pain-pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system-is underdiagnosed and difficult to treat. However, development of easy-to-use questionnaires based mainly on self-reports of symptoms has improved diagnosis and management. Two types of questionnaires (screening and assessment) have been validated, and rapidly translated and revalidated in several languages, probably because of their simplicity. Screening questionnaires help clinicians to identify neuropathic pain easily, particularly in patients with complex medical conditions (eg, spinal cord injury). Their use in large-scale epidemiological studies has provided estimates of the prevalence of neuropathic pain and identified risk factors for neuropathic pain in the general population and in disorders such as diabetes. Assessment questionnaires measure neuropathic symptoms and have been used to create phenotypic profiles of patients in various neuropathic conditions. These profiles can predict treatment outcomes, and thus enable a personalised therapeutic approach. The dissemination of these questionnaires in different countries should further improve diagnosis and management worldwide and advance knowledge on the mechanisms of neuropathic pain.

### Defining neuropathic pain [^112wuqwU]. Anesthesia and Analgesia (2003). Low credibility.

Clinical research and practice have suffered because of lack of specificity when clinical diagnoses of pain are made. Distinction between neuropathic and inflammatory pain mechanisms is suggested, as well as the distinction between neuropathic pain from hypersensitivity pain disorders, previously termed neuropathic pain due to neurological dysfunction. Neuropathic pain is in this case defined as pain occurring in the ara of body affected by neurological disease or injury. This type of pain manifests not only with positive sensory phenomena such as pain, dysesthesia, and different types of hyperalgesia, but also with negative sensory phenomena and negative and positive motor and autonomic symptoms and signs.

Figure 2.
Flow chart of updated grading system for neuropathic pain. a History, including pain descriptors, the presence of nonpainful sensory symptoms, and aggravating and alleviating factors, suggestive of pain being related to a neurological lesion and not other causes such as inflammation or non-neural tissue damage. The suspected lesion or disease is reported to be associated with neuropathic pain, including a temporal and spatial relationship representative of the condition; includes paroxysmal pain in trigeminal neuralgia. b The pain distribution reported by the patient is consistent with the suspected lesion or disease (Table 1). c The area of sensory changes may extend beyond, be within, or overlap with the area of pain. Sensory loss is generally required but touch-evoked or thermal allodynia may be the only finding at bedside examination. Trigger phenomena in trigeminal neuralgia may be counted as sensory signs. In some cases, sensory signs may be difficult to demonstrate although the nature of the lesion or disease is confirmed; for these cases the level "probable" continues to be appropriate, if a diagnostic test confirms the lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system. d The term "definite" in this context means "probable neuropathic pain with confirmatory tests" because the location and nature of the lesion or disease have been confirmed to be able to explain the pain. "Definite" neuropathic pain is a pain that is fully compatible with neuropathic pain, but it does not necessarily establish causality.

### How diagnostic tests help to disentangle the mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain symptoms in painful neuropathies [^1135QFkC]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain, ie, pain arising directly from a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory afferent pathway, manifests with various symptoms, the commonest being ongoing burning pain, electrical shock-like sensations, and dynamic mechanical allodynia. Reliable insights into the mechanisms underlying neuropathic pain symptoms come from diagnostic tests documenting and quantifying somatosensory afferent pathway damage in patients with painful neuropathies. Neurophysiological investigation and skin biopsy studies suggest that ongoing burning pain primarily reflects spontaneous activity in nociceptive-fiber pathways. Electrical shock-like sensations presumably arise from high-frequency ectopic bursts generated in demyelinated, nonnociceptive, Aβ fibers. Although the mechanisms underlying dynamic mechanical allodynia remain debatable, normally innocuous stimuli might cause pain by activating spared and sensitized nociceptive afferents. Extending the mechanistic approach to neuropathic pain symptoms might advance targeted therapy for the individual patient and improve testing for new drugs.

### Neuropathic pain: mechanisms and their clinical implications [^114ZA4DH]. BMJ (2014). Excellent credibility.

Neuropathic pain can develop after nerve injury, when deleterious changes occur in injured neurons and along nociceptive and descending modulatory pathways in the central nervous system. The myriad neurotransmitters and other substances involved in the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain also play a part in other neurobiological disorders. This might partly explain the high comorbidity rates for chronic pain, sleep disorders, and psychological conditions such as depression, and why drugs that are effective for one condition may benefit others. Neuropathic pain can be distinguished from non-neuropathic pain by two factors. Firstly, in neuropathic pain there is no transduction (conversion of a nociceptive stimulus into an electrical impulse). Secondly, the prognosis is worse: injury to major nerves is more likely than injury to non-nervous tissue to result in chronic pain. In addition, neuropathic pain tends to be more refractory than non-neuropathic pain to conventional analgesics, such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and opioids. However, because of the considerable overlap between neuropathic and nociceptive pain in terms of mechanisms and treatment modalities, it might be more constructive to view these entities as different points on the same continuum. This review focuses on the mechanisms of neuropathic pain, with special emphasis on clinical implications.

### Is the capsaicin 179 mg (8% w/ w) cutaneous patch an appropriate treatment option for older patients with peripheral neuropathic pain? [^115jrQsH]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neuropathic pain, a type of chronic pain that arises as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system, may affect ~30% of older adults (aged > 60 years). This compares to a prevalence of 3–18% in the general population in Western countries. Most commonly, localized neuropathic pain has a peripheral presentation characterized by a consistent and circumscribed area of maximum pain. Neuropathic pain impairs quality of life and can exacerbate functional decline with age. Persistent pain (of any type) in older adults has also been associated with an increased risk of frailty.

Pharmacotherapy is the recommended first-line treatment for localized neuropathic pain. However, neuropathic pain can be difficult to treat, and oral systemic treatment options (such as antidepressants, antiepileptic drugs, and/or opioids) often provide incomplete pain relief, with side effects and drug─drug interactions that can limit long-term use. Locally applied treatments that target the allodynic or hyperalgesic area with very limited systemic effects may be preferred, particularly in older patients with multiple comorbidities and polypharmacy.

### Neuropathic pain [^113JieAf]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2017). Medium credibility.

Neuropathic pain is caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory system, including peripheral fibres (Aβ, Aδ and C fibres) and central neurons, and affects 7–10% of the general population. Multiple causes of neuropathic pain have been described and its incidence is likely to increase owing to the ageing global population, increased incidence of diabetes mellitus and improved survival from cancer after chemotherapy. Indeed, imbalances between excitatory and inhibitory somatosensory signalling, alterations in ion channels and variability in the way that pain messages are modulated in the central nervous system all have been implicated in neuropathic pain. The burden of chronic neuropathic pain seems to be related to the complexity of neuropathic symptoms, poor outcomes and difficult treatment decisions. Importantly, quality of life is impaired in patients with neuropathic pain owing to increased drug prescriptions and visits to health care providers, as well as the morbidity from the pain itself and the inciting disease. Despite challenges, progress in the understanding of the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain is spurring the development of new diagnostic procedures and personalized interventions, which emphasize the need for a multidisciplinary approach to the management of neuropathic pain.

### Can pain can be more or less neuropathic? Comparison of symptom assessment tools with ratings of certainty by clinicians [^116adLrr]. Pain (2006). Low credibility.

Chronic pain is generally regarded as being divided into two mutually exclusive pain mechanisms: nociceptive and neuropathic. Recently, this dichotomous approach has been questioned and a model of chronic pain being 'more or less neuropathic' has been suggested. To test whether such a spectrum exists, we examined responses by patients with chronic pain to validated neuropathic pain assessment tools and compared these with ratings of certainty about the neuropathic origin of pain by their specialist pain physicians. We examined 200 patients (100 each with nociceptive and neuropathic pain) and administered the self-complete Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (S-LANSS score) and the Neuropathic Pain Scale (NPS). Clinicians were asked to rate their certainty of the presence of neuropathic pain mechanisms on a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS) (0 = 'not at all neuropathic in origin' to 100 = 'completely neuropathic in origin'). The whole sample was divided into tertiles based on ascending ratings of diagnostic certainty by clinicians using the VAS and labelled 'unlikely', 'possible' and 'definite' neuropathic pain. There were significant differences in median S-LANSS and NPS composite scores between all tertile groups. There were also significant differences between many S-LANSS and NPS item scores between groups. We have shown that higher scores on both the S-LANSS and the NPS are indicative of greater clinician certainty of neuropathic pain mechanisms being present. These data support the theoretical construct that pain can be more or less neuropathic and that pain of predominantly neuropathic origin may be a useful clinical concept.

### Neuropathic pain: diagnosis and treatment [^1175AKtc]. Practical Neurology (2013). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain (NP) develops as a consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory pathways in the peripheral or central nervous system, and occurs in many neurological diseases (eg, peripheral neuropathy, radiculopathy, spinal cord injury, stroke and multiple sclerosis). It affects 6%-8% of the general population and its impact on quality of life, mood and sleep exceeds the burden of its causative pathology. A peculiar feature of NP is the coexistence of negative and positive symptoms and signs, reflecting loss-of-function and gain-of-function of the somatosensory system, respectively. NP has long been considered a difficult clinical issue because of the lack of a diagnostic gold standard and the unsatisfactory response to treatment. In recent years, a redefinition, diagnostic algorithm, and some guidelines on diagnosis and treatment of NP have been published. This review offers an updated overview on the definition, pathophysiology, clinical evaluation, diagnosis and treatment of NP and focuses on some of the most frequent NP conditions. We intend to help overcome uncertainties on NP and bridge the gap between evidence based medicine and the real clinical world.

### Evaluation of symptom heterogeneity in neuropathic pain using assessments of sensory functions [^113A19At]. Neurotherapeutics (2009). Low credibility.

Classification of neuropathic pain has been based on disease entities, anatomical localization, or histological observations. Over the past decade, there has been an explosion in our understanding of the basic mechanisms of neuropathic pain. The exciting advances in basic science are paralleled by the recognition from clinical investigations that neuropathic pain is not a monolithic entity, but instead presents as a composite of pain and other sensory symptoms. Attempts are under way to supplement the traditional classification with a classification that links pain and sensory symptoms with neurobiological mechanisms. This mechanism- or symptom-based classification takes both negative and positive sensory symptoms into account. By using a battery of several standardized quantitative sensory tests, the characteristic profile of sensory symptoms can be elucidated in each patient. Moreover, in questionnaires the verbal descriptors can depict the quality and intensity of the individual pain. The approach of classifying and subgrouping patients with neuropathic pain on the basis of symptoms or signs opens up new possibilities for stratifying patients in clinical trials. First, in clinical proof-of-concept trials the study population can be enriched prospectively on the basis of entry criteria defined a priori. This enrichment with patients who potentially require a specific treatment should increase the likelihood for positive trial outcomes. Second, in clinical practice it becomes possible to establish an individualized therapy — that is, to identify the particular patients who require a specific treatment option.

### Types and epidemiology of cancer-related neuropathic pain: the intersection of cancer pain and neuropathic pain [^112NKdYr]. The Oncologist (2010). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain — pain resulting from a lesion, damage, or dysfunction of the somatosensory nervous system — can arise through several distinct etiologies ranging from toxicity, surgery, radiation, and trauma to congenital disorders. Neuropathic pain is widely recognized as a common consequence of cancer and results from administration of several common oncology drugs. It not only impacts quality of life, but it also impacts patient outcomes because of resulting treatment delays, dose reductions, and discontinuations. We estimate that the cost of the problem in the U.S. alone is approximately $2.3 billion. Despite its widely recognized importance, there is a paucity of reliable information available regarding the incidence, prevalence of patient-and physician-reported severity, and time course of cancer-related neuropathic pain. To address this severe knowledge gap, we need new, high-quality, population-based studies of individual cancer pain syndromes and conditions. However, in order to gather this information, we also need substantial improvements in the specific classification of cancer-related neuropathic syndromes and better validated diagnostic tools that can help to elucidate the incidence, prevalence, severity, and potential economic impact of cancer-associated neuropathies.

A recent review and meta-analysis on pharmacotherapy for neuropathic pain provides a precise update on treatment efficacy and adverse effects. The authors offer revised evidence-based recommendations for first-line therapies and subsequent options, but we still a need to improve individual treatment decisions, including nonpharmacological therapies, in affected patients.

### Neuropathic pain: an updated grading system for research and clinical practice [^115vEiKe]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

Thus, the 2008 grading paper was mostly cited for the redefinition of neuropathic pain. The redefinition has since been introduced in the IASP terminology with minor modifications, and hence the authors' aim "to develop a more precise definition of neuropathic pain that will be useful for clinical and research purposes" has largely been achieved. The adoption of the grading system has naturally happened after a delay, and since 2011 a steady ratio of about 1/3 of clinical trials in the field have used it (Fig. 1).

A meta-analysis of cancer trialsindicated that of the 4 criteria of the grading system, criterion 2 "a history suggestive of a relevant lesion or disease affecting the peripheral or central somatosensory system" and criterion 3 "demonstration of the distinct neuroanatomically plausible distribution by at least 1 confirmatory test" were available in the majority of trials (13–14 of 22), whereas criterion 1 "pain with a distinct neuroanatomically plausible distribution" was available less often (10/22) and confirmation of the underlying lesion of disease was rarely done (criterion 4, 7/22). This identifies 2 problems to be addressed in the present revision: (1) plausibility of pain distribution and its assessment and (2) need for establishing the neurological diagnosis by confirmatory tests.

In addition, the following deficiencies were identified from the paper reviews and discussed during the committee meeting: (1) Several screening tools (questionnaires) were developed before the redefinition of neuropathic pain by NeuPSIG and IASP, but are not positioned in the grading system; (2) Some clinicians and investigators have difficulty in determining the topographical location of a lesion and its pathology, as the approach used in neurology of "where is the lesion?", "what is the lesion?" is not intuitive to other medical disciplines; (3) Certain sensory signs are not specific to neuropathic pain; and (4) Determination of lesion type and location does not necessarily prove that the pain is caused by that lesion or disease (uncertainty of causal relationship).

Based on these limitations of the current grading system, we propose a change to the order of the grading criteria to better reflect clinical practice and have furthermore annotated the terms used to improve clarity (Fig. 2). In addition, a research agenda is proposed to further address shortcomings of the grading system.

### An overview of the non-procedural treatment options for peripheral neuropathic pain [^117QeyC9]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

4 CONCLUSIONS

Peripheral neuropathic pain is a common condition affecting a large portion of the population. Treatment choices are broad and diverse, giving clinicians a variety of options that can be tailored to the individual patient. While medications have the highest level of evidence for treatment, other options including therapy, modality, psychological, and lifestyle approaches should be considered as a part of the treatment algorithm. These approaches can often be used in tandem to hopefully provide the patient with a well‐rounded treatment plan for peripheral neuropathic pain.

### Neuropathic pain: an updated grading system for research and clinical practice [^114KbbEB]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

1. Introduction

In 1994, the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) defined neuropathic pain as "pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction in the nervous system". In 2008, a task force initiated by the IASP Special Interest Group on Neuropathic Pain (NeuPSIG) noted the need to distinguish neuropathic pain from nociceptive pain arising indirectly from neurological disorders and pain conditions with secondary neuroplastic changes occurring in the nociceptive system, and proposed a new definition that omitted the term "dysfunction": "pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system". A slightly modified version of this definition was proposed by the IASP Taxonomy Committee and accepted by the IASP: "pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system". The omission of the term "dysfunction" excludes conditions involving ill-defined changes in the nervous system and conditions with no known lesion of the somatosensory nervous system from being classified as neuropathic pain. The restriction to the somatosensory nervous system is important because conditions such as musculoskeletal pain (eg, due to spasticity) arising indirectly from disorders of the motor system should not be confused with neuropathic pain. The term "primary" was omitted because of the difficulty in distinguishing between primary and secondary causes of neuropathic pain; however, the omission means that nociceptive pain conditions that — over time — may cause secondary lesions in the somatosensory nervous system could ultimately be considered as being partly neuropathic pain.

Recognizing the challenges of determining the presence of neuropathic pain according to this new definition, NeuPSIG also proposed a grading systemto guide decisions on the level of certainty with which neuropathic pain can be determined in an individual patient. Three levels of certainty — possible, probable, and definite neuropathic pain — were proposed. As an activity in the Global Year Against Neuropathic Pain, NeuPSIG established a committee to (1) critically evaluate the use of the grading system in the 7 years after its publication, (2) assess the usefulness and limitations of the grading system, and (3) update the grading system if required, for improved application in clinical and research settings. The committee consisted of an expert panel of neurologists, clinical neurophysiologists, neuroscientists, anesthesiologists, pain specialists, primary care physicians, and population health scientists.

### Neuropathic pain: an updated grading system for research and clinical practice [^114hxPhb]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

4. Revised grading system

The grading system is intended for determining the level of certainty with which the pain in question is neuropathic. A finding of probable neuropathic pain in a given individual patient should prompt consideration of treatment according to the neuropathic pain treatment guidelines, but the grading system is not intended for medico-legal purposes or to classify diseases. The refinements in the present grading system (Fig. 2) follow the classical clinical method of diagnosis in that history, clinical examination, and diagnostic tests stepwise add to level of certainty that the pain in question is neuropathic.

4.1. Possible neuropathic pain

Evaluation of the patient according to the grading system should be undertaken if the patient's history suggests that pain could be related to a neurological lesion or disease and not other causes such as inflammation or non-neural tissue damage. At this stage, pain descriptors, the presence of nonpainful sensory symptoms, and any aggravating and alleviating factors can be taken into account. Pain descriptions such as burning or hot, electric shocks or shooting, pricking or pins and needles, pain evoked by light touching or cold, and nonpainful sensations such as numbness and tingling are suggestive, but not pathognomonic for neuropathic pain, and other descriptors may apply as well. The combination of several descriptors, however, has a highly discriminant value and several screening tools (questionnaires) have been developed to identify patients who may have neuropathic pain to alert the clinician to undertake further assessment (though they cannot be used alone to identify neuropathic pain). These include, but are not limited to the LANSS, the neuropathic pain questionnaire, the Douleur Neuropathique en 4 questions, the painDETECT, and ID-Pain.

The following two criteria need to be fulfilled to reach the first level of certainty-"possible" neuropathic pain.

### Morphine for chronic neuropathic pain in adults [^1156qEGM]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Neuropathic pain, which is caused by a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system, may be central or peripheral in origin. Neuropathic pain often includes symptoms such as burning or shooting sensations, abnormal sensitivity to normally painless stimuli, or an increased sensitivity to normally painful stimuli. Neuropathic pain is a common symptom in many diseases of the nervous system. Opioid drugs, including morphine, are commonly used to treat neuropathic pain. Most reviews have examined all opioids together. This review sought evidence specifically for morphine; other opioids are considered in separate reviews.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse events of morphine for chronic neuropathic pain in adults.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase for randomised controlled trials from inception to February 2017. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and online clinical trial registries.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials of two weeks' duration or longer, comparing morphine (any route of administration) with placebo or another active treatment for neuropathic pain, with participant-reported pain assessment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality and potential bias. Primary outcomes were participants with substantial pain relief (at least 50% pain relief over baseline or very much improved on Patient Global Impression of Change scale (PGIC)), or moderate pain relief (at least 30% pain relief over baseline or much or very much improved on PGIC). Where pooled analysis was possible, we used dichotomous data to calculate risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) or harmful outcome (NNH). We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE and created 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We identified five randomised, double-blind, cross-over studies with treatment periods of four to seven weeks, involving 236 participants in suitably characterised neuropathic pain; 152 (64%) participants completed all treatment periods. Oral morphine was titrated to maximum daily doses of 90 mg to 180 mg or the maximum tolerated dose, and then maintained for the remainder of the study. Participants had experienced moderate or severe neuropathic pain for at least three months. Included studies involved people with painful diabetic neuropathy, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia criteria, phantom limb or postamputation pain, and lumbar radiculopathy. Exclusions were typically people with other significant comorbidity or pain from other causes. Overall, we judged the studies to be at low risk of bias, but there were concerns over small study size and the imputation method used for participants who withdrew from the studies, both of which could lead to overestimation of treatment benefits and underestimation of harm. There was insufficient or no evidence for the primary outcomes of interest for efficacy or harm. Four studies reported an approximation of moderate pain improvement (any pain-related outcome indicating some improvement) comparing morphine with placebo in different types of neuropathic pain. We pooled these data in an exploratory analysis. Moderate improvement was experienced by 63% (87/138) of participants with morphine and 36% (45/125) with placebo; the risk difference (RD) was 0.27 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.38, fixed-effects analysis) and the NNT 3.7 (2.6 to 6.5). We assessed the quality of the evidence as very low because of the small number of events; available information did not provide a reliable indication of the likely effect, and the likelihood that the effect will be substantially different was very high. A similar exploratory analysis for substantial pain relief on three studies (177 participants) showed no difference between morphine and placebo. All-cause withdrawals in four studies occurred in 16% (24/152) of participants with morphine and 12% (16/137) with placebo. The RD was 0.04 (-0.04 to 0.12, random-effects analysis). Adverse events were inconsistently reported, more common with morphine than with placebo, and typical of opioids. There were two serious adverse events, one with morphine, and one with a combination of morphine and nortriptyline. No deaths were reported. These outcomes were assessed as very low quality because of the limited number of participants and events.

Authors' Conclusions

There was insufficient evidence to support or refute the suggestion that morphine has any efficacy in any neuropathic pain condition.

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^113UQA7e]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

4.2.3. Recommendation 3: definite neuropathic pain

For the level of certainty for definite neuropathic pain, an objective diagnostic test is required to confirm the suspected lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system explaining the pain.

In case of radiculopathies, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or other imaging techniques can confirm the presence of nerve root compromise at the relevant spinal level (eg, nerve root compression, flattening of the nerve root, or nerve root displacement). However, limitations mentioned above (eg, high false positive and false negative rate and positional dependence) should be acknowledged. Electrodiagnostic studies may indicate large fibre function compromise but cannot assess small fibre compromise.

Confirmative objective diagnostic tests are rarely available in the nonspecialist environment (eg, primary care) or lower resource settings or may not be indicated at least initially (eg, in spine-related leg pain where serious pathology is not expected). However, patients may still fulfill all criteria for the classification of probable neuropathic pain, and treatment according to the neuropathic treatment guidelines in this context should be considered. Even if only the requirements for possible neuropathic pain are met, but a clinician has very strong suspicion for the presence of neuropathic pain (eg, relevant motor signs are apparent and fit the symptom image or a patient rates high on neuropathic pain screening tools), treatments targeting neuropathic pain may be appropriate and indicated where potential benefits for the individual outweigh risks. This interpretation of the clinical grading system will enable clinicians in lower resourced settings to make appropriate clinical decisions when indicated.

4.3. Future directions in research

The recommendations from this working group serve as a foundation for future scientific efforts. The following have been identified as priority areas:
(1) Agreement on diagnostic criteria for each case definition (somatic-referred pain, radicular pain with or without radiculopathy) to standardise participant selection for clinical studies and facilitate pooling of data.
(2) Incorporation of case definitions and the adapted neuropathic pain grading system in future studies of spine-related leg pain to facilitate improved patient profiling and translation to clinical settings.
(3) Exploration of the value of case definitions and the adapted neuropathic pain grading system as stratification tools to identify groups of people for whom specific interventions may be appropriate.
(4) Operationalising the recommendations into trial design and monitoring outcomes to evaluate whether these recommendations help to improve trial quality and ability to interpret true efficacy for people with spine-related leg pain

### A scoping review of the diurnal variation in the intensity of neuropathic pain [^116gMuXn]. Pain Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Recent studies have suggested that neuropathic pain exhibits a daily diurnal pattern, with peak levels usually occurring in the late afternoon to evening and the trough in the morning hours, although literature on this topic has been sparse. This scoping review examines current evidence on the chronobiology of neuropathic pain both in animal models and in humans with neuropathic pain.

Methods

A literature search was conducted in major medical databases for relevant articles on the chronobiology of neuropathic pain both in animal models and in humans with neuropathic pain. Data extracted included details of specific animal models or specific neuropathic pain conditions in humans, methods and timing of assessing pain severity, and specific findings of diurnal variation in pain intensity or its surrogate markers.

Results

Thirteen animal and eight human studies published between 1976 and 2020 were included in the analysis. Seven of the 13 animal studies reported specific diurnal variation in pain intensity, with five of the seven studies reporting a trend toward increased sensitivity to mechanical allodynia or thermal hyperalgesia in the late light to dark phase. All eight studies in human subjects reported a diurnal variation in the intensity of neuropathic pain, where there was an increase in pain intensity through the day with peaks in the late evening and early night hours.

Conclusions

Studies included in this review demonstrated a diurnal variation in the pattern of neuropathic pain that is distinct from the pattern for nociceptive pain. These findings have implications for potential therapeutic strategies for neuropathic pain.

### Mechanisms of neuropathic pain [^114Nkvp8]. Neuron (2006). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain refers to pain that originates from pathology of the nervous system. Diabetes, infection (herpes zoster), nerve compression, nerve trauma, "channelopathies", and autoimmune disease are examples of diseases that may cause neuropathic pain. The development of both animal models and newer pharmacological strategies has led to an explosion of interest in the underlying mechanisms. Neuropathic pain reflects both peripheral and central sensitization mechanisms. Abnormal signals arise not only from injured axons but also from the intact nociceptors that share the innervation territory of the injured nerve. This review focuses on how both human studies and animal models are helping to elucidate the mechanisms underlying these surprisingly common disorders. The rapid gain in knowledge about abnormal signaling promises breakthroughs in the treatment of these often debilitating disorders.

### EFNS guidelines on neuropathic pain assessment [^112n1nF5]. European Journal of Neurology (2004). Low credibility.

In September 2001, a Task Force was set up under the auspices of the European Federation of Neurological Societies with the aim of evaluating the existing evidence about the methods of assessing neuropathic pain and its treatments. This review led to the development of guidelines to be used in the management of patients with neuropathic pain. In the clinical setting a neurological examination that includes an accurate sensory examination is often sufficient to reach a diagnosis. Nerve conduction studies and somatosensory-evoked potentials, which do not assess small fibre function, may demonstrate and localize a peripheral or central nervous lesion. A quantitative assessment of the nociceptive pathways is provided by quantitative sensory testing and laser-evoked potentials. To evaluate treatment efficacy in a patient and in controlled trials, the simplest psychometric scales and quality of life measures are probably the best methods. A laboratory measure of pain that by-passes the subjective report, and thus cognitive influences, is a hopeful aim for the future.

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^111iT4ob]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Methods

All guidelines focused on the assessment of neuropathic pain highlight the use of a comprehensive history and examination with reliance on clinical judgment in the interpretation of screening tools and investigations.

History

Neuropathic pain stems from a wide variety of causes that can be broadly organized into two basic categories: peripheral and central etiologies. However, presentation may be variable both between peripheral and central etiologies and within individuals with the same etiology. Common peripheral neuropathic conditions include diabetic peripheral polyneuropathy, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, radicular pain (RP), and postsurgical chronic neuropathic pain (PSCP). Central conditions include multiple sclerosis, poststroke pain, spinal cord injury–related pain, postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), and trigeminal neuralgia (TN).

The clinical presentation of neuropathic pain commonly includes descriptions of burning, pins and needles (paresthesia), tingling, numbness, electric shocks/shooting, crawling (formication), itching, and intolerance to temperature. In more advanced cases, patients may describe pain arising from stimuli that are not usually painful (i.e. allodynia) or pain from normally painful stimuli that is out of proportion to what would be expected. (i.e. hyperalgesia).

The use of validated questionnaires is a simple means of identifying the presence of neuropathic pain and quantifying its impact on the patient: PainDetect, Douleur Neuropathique en 4 Questions (DN4), and the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms (LANSS). PainDetect relies solely on patient input without the need for a physical exam, with a sensitivity and specificity of 85% and 80%, respectively. The DN4 and LANSS are both short measures of the presence of neuropathic pain. The DN4 has seven pain discriminators and three examination findings: a score of 4+ indicates that neuropathic pain is likely, and its sensitivity and specificity are 83% and 90%. The LANSS has five symptom descriptors and two examination findings. Its sensitivity and specificity are 82–91% and 80–94%. The more conventionally known numeric rating scale (NRS) and/or the visual analog scale (VAS) can be used to measure pain intensity.

### Managing the symptoms of neuropathic pain: an exploration of patients' experiences [^113tRAjj]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2007). Low credibility.

The debilitating effects of chronic neuropathic pain on everyday life are considerable, but little is known about how individual sufferers manage these effects. Virtually nothing is known about what patients prefer, what measures they take themselves and when, or in what combinations. The aim of this study was to explore patients' reports of how they managed their neuropathic pain symptoms. Three focus groups (10 participants in total) were used to generate qualitative data on both individual and shared experiences of managing symptoms of neuropathic pain. Discussions were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis, identifying categories and broader themes of importance to patients. The most common management strategy was the use of conventional medications, often associated with poor effectiveness and unpleasant side effects. Complementary and alternative medicine was ineffective, but many found resting or retreating helpful. They exhibited a repeated cycle of seeking help to manage the pain, with each unsuccessful attempt followed by new attempts. Some had tried to accept their pain, but there was insufficient psychological, social, emotional, and practical support to allow them to do this successfully. This exploratory study provides a basis from which to develop a larger study to validate and extend the findings. Other issues meriting research are the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapies for those with neuropathic pain, and an exploration and subsequent evaluation of different types of social, practical, and emotional support needed to help live with neuropathic pain.

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^114uMhwB]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

4.2.2. Recommendation 2: probable neuropathic pain

The pain is associated with sensory signs in the same neuroanatomically plausible distribution (see above on pain distribution vs distribution of sensory signs). This can be probed through a clinical examination, eg, bedside sensory testing, which should provide supporting evidence for the suspected nerve root lesion for criterion 3 (Fig. 5) to be met.

c)The area of sensory changes may extend beyond or overlap the area of pain. Sometimes, nociceptive pain may also be accompanied by the loss of function. However, this often does not follow neuroanatomical borders, is not reproducible, and has mainly been reported with sensitive laboratory tests (eg, quantitative sensory testing) rather than with bedside sensory examinations.

Sensory signs in the relevant neuroanatomical distribution are typically negative sensory signs, ie, partial or complete sensory loss, indicative of a nerve conduction slowing or block or axotomy, respectively. Loss of function may occur in large or small sensory nerve fibres. As such, assessment of touch, vibration, pinprick, and cold and warm sensitivity is crucial for the examination of large and small fibre function. Positive sensory signs, such as tactile allodyniaand thermal hyperalgesia, have been documented in patients with lumbosacral radicular pain or radiculopathy. Sensory gain can mask sensory loss, making it difficult to detect the latter with currently available bedside sensory tests. With the revised neuropathic pain grading system, positive sensory signs in the absence of sensory loss are deemed sufficient to satisfy the classification of probable neuropathic pain, as long as they are in a neuroanatomically plausible distribution. The expert panel agreed, although not unanimously, that positive sensory signs do not weigh as strongly as an indicator of a nerve lesion compared with sensory loss. However, in the absence of high-quality data, no recommendation could be made whether positive sensory signs taken in isolation are sufficient to fulfill the criteria of probable neuropathic pain in the context of spine-related leg pain.

### Neuropathic pruritus [^115sNBgW]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2014). Medium credibility.

Pruritus, also known as itch, is a very common, unpleasant sensation that elicits an urge to scratch. Its origin is not always in the skin, and neuropathic itch that is caused by neuronal or glial damage is common, but poorly understood by both dermatologists and neurologists. Although pruritus has not been considered as serious a symptom as pain, it is difficult to treat and — if chronic — can severely impair quality of life. Neuropathic itch is often associated with other clinical symptoms, most commonly neuropathic pain, and hypersensitization to stimuli is present in both pruritus and pain of neuropathic origin. The shared aetiology can aid in finding suitable treatment for itch in some cases, but more detailed knowledge of the mechanisms of itch, along with standardized, well-controlled trials, is needed. Pruritus research is an emerging but currently very active field, and our understanding of this sensation is rapidly increasing. Here, we review new discoveries regarding the role of the nervous system and the contribution of different pathways in pruritus, discuss the different aetiologies of neuropathic itch, and outline currently available and potential strategies for managing neuropathic pruritus.

### Approach to peripheral neuropathy for the primary care clinician [^116qrrcb]. The American Journal of Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Peripheral neuropathy is commonly encountered in the primary care setting and is associated with significant morbidity, including neuropathic pain, falls, and disability. The clinical presentation of neuropathy is diverse, with possible symptoms including weakness, sensory abnormalities, and autonomic dysfunction. Accordingly, the primary care clinician must be comfortable using the neurologic examination-including the assessment of motor function, multiple sensory modalities, and deep tendon reflexes-to recognize and characterize neuropathy. Although the causes of peripheral neuropathy are numerous and diverse, careful review of the medical and family history coupled with limited, select laboratory testing can often efficiently lead to an etiologic diagnosis. This review offers an approach for evaluating suspected neuropathy in the primary care setting. It will describe the most common causes, suggest an evidence-based workup to aid in diagnosis, and highlight recent evidence that allows for selection of symptomatic treatment of patients with neuropathy.

### Neuropathic pain phenotyping by international consensus (neuroPPIC) for genetic studies: a neuPSIG systematic review, Delphi survey, and expert panel recommendations [^112qKqJQ]. Pain (2015). Low credibility.

3.3. Consensus meeting

The primary goal of the meeting was the development of a consensus statement on "entry level" phenotyping requirements for genetic studies of neuropathic pain in human adults.

3.3.1. Consensus statement development

Participants agreed that there is an inverse relationship between accurate case ascertainment of neuropathic pain and large-scale implementation thereof in population-based studies. We agreed that the entry-level phenotyping requirements included in the statement should form the basis of establishing neuropathic pain "caseness" for genetic studies. This basic phenotyping must allow the addition of more in-depth measures for higher level phenotyping to allow the identification of genetic loci for specific aspects of neuropathic pain other than just presence or absence of neuropathic pain. The entry-level requirements should provide a framework to guide researchers on study design and provide a platform to appraise their findings to allow feasible and valid assessment for the presence or absence of neuropathic pain in large population-based genetic studies.

3.3.2. "Entry level" phenotyping for genetic studies, a consensus

Box 1 shows the agreed NeuroPPIC entry-level requirements that would allow the classification of participants as having "possible" neuropathic pain. Consistent with the findings of the Delphi survey, a neuropathic pain "case" must have:
(1) pain with neuropathic characteristics (ie, positive on a validated screening questionnaire; or pain, ie, "hot/burning" and/or "pain evoked by light touch");
(2) a distribution or location of this pain that is anatomically consistent with an underlying somatosensory lesion or disease (as indicated by a body chart or body parts checklist); and
(3) further characterisation in the form of a clinical history (duration and intensity of pain and presence of other pains) and demographic information relevant to the population/disease being studied.

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^111SMXxY]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

In the premeeting survey sent to the working group, there was strong consensus that it is important to know whether or not a person with spine-related leg pain has neuropathic pain (Fig. 3). The most frequent reason given was that the information would guide treatment and management, including self-management.

Figure 3.
Panel ratings for the importance of identifying neuropathic pain in a person with spine-related leg pain.

The challenge, however, is to determine whether spine-related leg pain, in particular, radicular pain, is nociceptive, neuropathic, or mixed. Patients with radicular pain often describe their symptoms with seemingly neuropathic characteristics, such as electric shocks, shooting pain, tingling, and pins and needles. However, the frequent absence of obvious signs of a nerve lesion (eg, sensory loss of function and diagnostic tests), the absence of a dermatomal symptom distribution in 2 thirds of patients with radicular pain, and the frequent lack of a specific history indicating a neural lesion mean that many patients do not meet the diagnostic criteria for peripheral neuropathic pain outlined in the ICD-11 system. In the absence of sensory changes and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, patients with radicular pain would at best reach a classification of possible neuropathic pain according to the NeuPSIG neuropathic pain grading system. As such, identifying the presence of neuropathic pain in patients with spine-related leg pain can be challenging.

For Phase 2, the panel was tasked with the following activities:
(1) Discussing and reaching consensus on the classification of neuropathic pain for the specific terms recommended in objective 1 and
(2) Considering the need for any specification or adaptation of the current neuropathic pain grading system to accommodate these recommendations.

### Painful neuropathies [^114hTd9x]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2003). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

To summarize the current understanding of clinical assessment, pathophysiology, and treatment of pain in neuropathies, focusing on selected entities in which the understanding of the mechanisms underlying pain has advanced recently.

Recent Findings

Ongoing studies are classifying the symptoms and signs of painful neuropathies, assuming that this approach may indicate particular pathomechanisms leading to more rational treatment. Nerve injury induces a large number of cellular changes, the relevance of which for the occurrence of pain is still under investigation. In models of diabetic neuropathy, an altered distribution of sodium channels, hyperexcitability of neurons, and changes in spinal connectivity seem to underlie the development of pain. The role of inflammatory mediators has been explored in inflammatory and degenerative neuropathies. Second messenger pathways contributing to hyperalgesia in various neuropathies have been identified, opening up new treatment options. A number of newer and older drugs have been studied for their use in painful neuropathies in clinical trials. Epidemiology has shown that, despite the availability of drugs with moderate efficacy in the treatment of neuropathic pain, a large percentage of patients do not gain access to them.

Summary

Advances in the standardization of assessment of patients with painful neuropathies are beginning to have an impact on how clinical studies are designed. Major progress has been made in the understanding of cellular and molecular changes after nerve injury, but their relevance for the pathophysiology of pain in neuropathies has still to be determined.

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^1138PsNk]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

The panel discussed the application of the neuropathic pain grading system in the context of spine-related leg pain, including the use of several case studies of patients to test operationalisation of the system. This discussion identified differences in the application of the grading system among panel members and highlighted that the further clarification on the interpretation of requirements for possible and probable neuropathic pain was needed in the context of spine-related leg pain. The following challenges and uncertainties to the interpretation of the current grading system were identified by the working group:
(1) The often insidious onset of spine-related leg pain with no clear temporal or spatial relationship with a nerve lesion and how to interpret that in relation to the "history of relevant neurological lesion or disease".
(2) The absence of a clear dermatomal symptom distribution in about two thirds of patients with radicular painand whether such pain presentation would still be considered as "neuroanatomically plausible".
(3) The presence of neuropathic symptom descriptors such as electric shocks, shooting pain, tingling, and pins and needles or aggravating or alleviating factors suggestive of pain relating to a neurological lesion may be the only indications in patients with radicular pain. It remained unclear how much weight would be attributed to these symptoms, especially in the absence of a history of a neurological lesion.
(4) The frequent absence of sensory loss on bedside sensory examination. Sensory loss of function may in few people only be apparent on laboratory quantitative sensory testing, which may not be available in all clinical settings. However, using quantitative sensory testing delineation of borders is not possible, leaving uncertainty about the neuroanatomically plausible distribution of the sensory loss.
(5) The absence of frank sensory loss but presence of thermal hyperalgesia in patients with neuropathic pain/nerve injury, including patients with lumbosacral radiculopathy (∼33%)or mechanical allodynia in patients with lumbar radicular pain with or without radiculopathy. However, gain of function is not necessarily discriminative of neuropathic conditions, as it is also found in nociceptive conditions. A typical example is the widespread mechanical hyperalgesia reported in patients with nonspecific low back pain.
(6) It was unclear to panel members how much weight would be given to "positive" sensory signs in the absence of sensory loss.
(7) Some patients have myotomal loss of function (weakness or reflex reduction) in addition to their pain (e.g. painful motor radiculopathy). This can be indicative of a nerve root lesion, but this is not considered in the current grading system.
(8) The questionable sensitivity of many confirmatory tests to detect nerve involvement in patients with spine-related leg pain. For instance, routine MRI displays about 30% false positives and false negativesand positional dependence seems to influence interpretation (eg, higher nerve root compression grades during standing than the conventional supine position).

### Neuropathic pain phenotyping by international consensus (neuroPPIC) for genetic studies: a neuPSIG systematic review, Delphi survey, and expert panel recommendations [^112vytd6]. Pain (2015). Low credibility.

For genetic research to contribute more fully to furthering our knowledge of neuropathic pain, we require an agreed, valid, and feasible approach to phenotyping, to allow collaboration and replication in samples of sufficient size. Results from genetic studies on neuropathic pain have been inconsistent and have met with replication difficulties, in part because of differences in phenotypes used for case ascertainment. Because there is no consensus on the nature of these phenotypes, nor on the methods of collecting them, this study aimed to provide guidelines on collecting and reporting phenotypes in cases and controls for genetic studies. Consensus was achieved through a staged approach: (1) systematic literature review to identify all neuropathic pain phenotypes used in previous genetic studies; (2) Delphi survey to identify the most useful neuropathic pain phenotypes and their validity and feasibility; and (3) meeting of experts to reach consensus on the optimal phenotype(s) to be collected from patients with neuropathic pain for genetic studies. A basic "entry level" set of phenotypes was identified for any genetic study of neuropathic pain. This set identifies cases of "possible" neuropathic pain, and controls, and includes: (1) a validated symptom-based questionnaire to determine whether any pain is likely to be neuropathic; (2) body chart or checklist to identify whether the area of pain distribution is neuroanatomically logical; and (3) details of pain history (intensity, duration, any formal diagnosis). This NeuroPPIC "entry level" set of phenotypes can be expanded by more extensive and specific measures, as determined by scientific requirements and resource availability.

### Neuropathic pain: an updated grading system for research and clinical practice [^113o7Wmo]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

4.1.1. A history of relevant neurological lesion or disease

There should be a clinical suspicion of a relevant lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system (eg, an episode of acute herpes zoster or a traumatic nerve injury). The temporal relationship between the lesion or disease and the pain may vary, but a close temporal relationship helps strengthen the clinical suspicion. The onset of pain is usually immediate or within a few weeks of the lesion or disease but may be delayed for up to several months after injury (eg, after stroke) or for many years in conditions with an insidious onset such as diabetic neuropathy. In some cases, the history of pain or sensory disturbances by themselves suggest a disease, eg, in polyneuropathy (peripheral neuropathy), where the insidious onset of distal pain or numbness may be the only history indicating the disease. Characteristic sudden short-lasting (usually a few seconds) paroxysmal pain in the face, which may recur several times and may be separated by a refractory period (usually some minutes), suggests trigeminal neuralgia, where the pain is the only symptom indicating a relevant neurological disease.

4.1.2. Pain distribution neuroanatomically plausible

The pain distribution should be anatomically consistent with the suspected location of the lesion or disease in the peripheral or central somatosensory nervous system (as derived from the patient's history). This can be difficult to decipher in the single patient, as the distribution of pain can occupy a smaller area or extend somewhat outside the innervation territory of a peripheral nerve or root or the somatotopic representation of the body within the central nervous system, but it should be in a distribution that is typical for the underlying disorder (see examples in Table 1). In painful channelopathies, the pain distribution may be unusual but should be consistent with the disorder, eg, familial episodic pain syndrome, in which pain is mainly localized to the chest and upper arms, or inherited erythromelalgia, in which pain is localized to the extremities (feet and hands and in some cases ears).

Common neuropathic pain conditions and neuroanatomically plausible distribution of pain symptoms and sensory signs.

When both requirements 1 and 2 of the pain history are fulfilled, the pain complaint may be termed possible neuropathic pain.

### Gabapentin dosing for neuropathic pain: evidence from randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials [^111QFifg]. Clinical Therapeutics (2003). Low credibility.

Background

Pain is one of the most common reasons for seeking medical attention, and neuropathic pain is among the most common types of pain. Despite its prevalence, neuropathic pain is often underrecognized and inadequately treated. Many cases are refractory to the medications traditionally used for pain, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Tricyclic antidepressants are considered first-line agents for neuropathic pain, but their use is limited by unwanted side effects and a risk of cardiovascular mortality.

Objectives

The goals of this article were to review data on the efficacy and tolerability of gabapentin in the treatment of neuropathic pain in adults and to determine the optimal dosing schedule.

Methods

Randomized controlled studies of gabapentin for neuropathic pain were identified through a search of PubMed and MEDLINE from 1966 to the present using the search terms gabapentin, randomized, placebo, and pain. Abstracts of identified articles were screened for study size (> 100 patients per treatment arm) and use of appropriate efficacy measures. A separate review based on information provided by the manufacturer of gabapentinaand clinical trial Web sites was conducted to ascertain whether there had been any other relevant industry- or government-sponsored trials. The manufacturer provided additional unpublshed study data.

Results

Data from 5 randomized, placebo-controlled trials were included in the review, 1 of which has not yet been published. Gabapentin was effective in the treatment of painful diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, and other neuropathic pain syndromes. It relieved symptoms of allodynia, burning pain, shooting pain, and hyperesthesia. Adverse effects were typically mild to moderate and usually subsided within approximately 10 days from the initiation of treatment. Based on available data, it appears that treatment should be started at a dose of 900 mg/d (300 mg/d on day 1, 600 mg/d on day 2, and 900 mg/d on day 3). Additional titration to 1800 mg/d is recommended for greater efficacy. Doses up to 3600 mg/d may be needed in some patients. The effective dose should be individualized according to patient response and tolerability.

Conclusion

At doses of 1800 to 3600 mg/d, gabapentin was effective and well tolerated in the treatment of adults with neuropathic pain.

### NeuPSIG guidelines on neuropathic pain assessment [^116AyNdy]. Pain (2011). Low credibility.

This is a revision of guidelines, originally published in 2004, for the assessment of patients with neuropathic pain. Neuropathic pain is defined as pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system either at peripheral or central level. Screening questionnaires are suitable for identifying potential patients with neuropathic pain, but further validation of them is needed for epidemiological purposes. Clinical examination, including accurate sensory examination, is the basis of neuropathic pain diagnosis. For more accurate sensory profiling, quantitative sensory testing is recommended for selected cases in clinic, including the diagnosis of small fiber neuropathies and for research purposes. Measurement of trigeminal reflexes mediated by A-beta fibers can be used to differentiate symptomatic trigeminal neuralgia from classical trigeminal neuralgia. Measurement of laser-evoked potentials is useful for assessing function of the A-delta fiber pathways in patients with neuropathic pain. Functional brain imaging is not currently useful for individual patients in clinical practice, but is an interesting research tool. Skin biopsy to measure the intraepidermal nerve fiber density should be performed in patients with clinical signs of small fiber dysfunction. The intensity of pain and treatment effect (both in clinic and trials) should be assessed with numerical rating scale or visual analog scale. For future neuropathic pain trials, pain relief scales, patient and clinician global impression of change, the proportion of responders (50% and 30% pain relief), validated neuropathic pain quality measures and assessment of sleep, mood, functional capacity and quality of life are recommended.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the management of neuropathic pain: a systematic review [^117MaWdc]. BMC Anesthesiology (2016). Low credibility.

Background

The management of neuropathic pain (NP) is challenging despite it being the recent focus of extensive research. A number of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the management of NP have been published worldwide over the past 2 decades. This study aimed to assess the quality of these CPGs.

Methods

We performed a systematic review of published CPGs for the management of NP. Three reviewers independently assessed the quality of the CPGs using the Appraisal of Guidelines Research and Evaluation II (AGREE-II) instrument, and recommendations of CPGs were also appraised.

Results

A total of 16 CPGs were included. Thirteen CPGs were developed using an evidence-based approach, and the remaining CPGs were produced by consensus panels. None of CPGs obtained a score greater than 50% in all six AGREE II instrument domains mainly owing to poor performance in the "Applicability" domain. The highest score of the CPGs was achieved in "Clarity and Presentation" domain, followed by "Scope and Purpose" and "Editorial Independence" domains, and the lowest scores were found the in "Applicability" domain. The majority of the CPG recommendations on the management of patients with NP were relatively consistent, especially regarding the recommendation of stepwise treatment with medication.

Conclusions

Greater efforts are needed not only to improve the quality of development and presentation of the CPGs, but also to provide more efficacy evidence for the management of patients with NP.

### Myofascial pain syndrome: an update on clinical characteristics, etiopathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment [^1177U8RA]. Muscle & Nerve (2025). Medium credibility.

6.2 Versus Neuropathic Pain Conditions

Neuropathic pain conditions, including radiculopathies and peripheral neuropathies, often mimic MPS due to overlapping symptoms, such as radiating or referred pain patterns. Radiculopathies involve compression or irritation of the nerve roots, resulting in pain, numbness, and weakness along the distribution of the affected nerve root. Similarly, peripheral neuropathies arise from damage to peripheral nerves and typically present with burning, tingling, or electric shock‐like sensations alongside pain.

Despite the similarities, there are distinct differences. Neuropathic pain is characterized by specific neurological signs, including sensory deficits and, when motor nerve fibers are involved, muscle weakness and altered reflexes — features that are absent in MPS. Additionally, while neuropathic pain patterns align with dermatomal distributions corresponding to affected nerve pathways, the referred pain patterns in MPS originate from trigger points in specific muscles and do not follow a dermatomal pattern. A thorough neurological examination is crucial, as it can help identify sensory abnormalities, muscle weakness, and reflex changes that are hallmarks of neuropathic conditions.

### Gabapentin for chronic neuropathic pain in adults [^113J3HNe]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Gabapentin is commonly used to treat neuropathic pain (pain due to nerve damage). This review updates a review published in 2014, and previous reviews published in 2011, 2005 and 2000.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse effects of gabapentin in chronic neuropathic pain in adults.

Search Methods

For this update we searched CENTRAL), MEDLINE, and Embase for randomised controlled trials from January 2014 to January 2017. We also searched the reference lists of retrieved studies and reviews, and online clinical trials registries.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised, double-blind trials of two weeks' duration or longer, comparing gabapentin (any route of administration) with placebo or another active treatment for neuropathic pain, with participant-reported pain assessment.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors independently extracted data and assessed trial quality and potential bias. Primary outcomes were participants with substantial pain relief (at least 50% pain relief over baseline or very much improved on Patient Global Impression of Change scale (PGIC)), or moderate pain relief (at least 30% pain relief over baseline or much or very much improved on PGIC). We performed a pooled analysis for any substantial or moderate benefit. Where pooled analysis was possible, we used dichotomous data to calculate risk ratio (RR) and number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNT) or harmful outcome (NNH). We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE and created 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included four new studies (530 participants), and excluded three previously included studies (126 participants). In all, 37 studies provided information on 5914 participants. Most studies used oral gabapentin or gabapentin encarbil at doses of 1200 mg or more daily in different neuropathic pain conditions, predominantly postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy. Study duration was typically four to 12 weeks. Not all studies reported important outcomes of interest. High risk of bias occurred mainly due to small size (especially in cross-over studies), and handling of data after study withdrawal. In postherpetic neuralgia, more participants (32%) had substantial benefit (at least 50% pain relief or PGIC very much improved) with gabapentin at 1200 mg daily or greater than with placebo (17%) (RR 1.8 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.1); NNT 6.7 (5.4 to 8.7); 8 studies, 2260 participants, moderate-quality evidence). More participants (46%) had moderate benefit (at least 30% pain relief or PGIC much or very much improved) with gabapentin at 1200 mg daily or greater than with placebo (25%) (RR 1.8 (95% CI 1.6 to 2.0); NNT 4.8 (4.1 to 6.0); 8 studies, 2260 participants, moderate-quality evidence). In painful diabetic neuropathy, more participants (38%) had substantial benefit (at least 50% pain relief or PGIC very much improved) with gabapentin at 1200 mg daily or greater than with placebo (21%) (RR 1.9 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.3); NNT 5.9 (4.6 to 8.3); 6 studies, 1277 participants, moderate-quality evidence). More participants (52%) had moderate benefit (at least 30% pain relief or PGIC much or very much improved) with gabapentin at 1200 mg daily or greater than with placebo (37%) (RR 1.4 (95% CI 1.3 to 1.6); NNT 6.6 (4.9 to 9.9); 7 studies, 1439 participants, moderate-quality evidence). For all conditions combined, adverse event withdrawals were more common with gabapentin (11%) than with placebo (8.2%) (RR 1.4 (95% CI 1.1 to 1.7); NNH 30 (20 to 65); 22 studies, 4346 participants, high-quality evidence). Serious adverse events were no more common with gabapentin (3.2%) than with placebo (2.8%) (RR 1.2 (95% CI 0.8 to 1.7); 19 studies, 3948 participants, moderate-quality evidence); there were eight deaths (very low-quality evidence). Participants experiencing at least one adverse event were more common with gabapentin (63%) than with placebo (49%) (RR 1.3 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.4); NNH 7.5 (6.1 to 9.6); 18 studies, 4279 participants, moderate-quality evidence). Individual adverse events occurred significantly more often with gabapentin. Participants taking gabapentin experienced dizziness (19%), somnolence (14%), peripheral oedema (7%), and gait disturbance (14%).

Authors' Conclusions

Gabapentin at doses of 1800 mg to 3600 mg daily (1200 mg to 3600 mg gabapentin encarbil) can provide good levels of pain relief to some people with postherpetic neuralgia and peripheral diabetic neuropathy. Evidence for other types of neuropathic pain is very limited. The outcome of at least 50% pain intensity reduction is regarded as a useful outcome of treatment by patients, and the achievement of this degree of pain relief is associated with important beneficial effects on sleep interference, fatigue, and depression, as well as quality of life, function, and work. Around 3 or 4 out of 10 participants achieved this degree of pain relief with gabapentin, compared with 1 or 2 out of 10 for placebo. Over half of those treated with gabapentin will not have worthwhile pain relief but may experience adverse events. Conclusions have not changed since the previous update of this review.

Glossary of pain and evidence terms — this page defines methods and outcomes relevant to evidence synthesis and pain classification: The Delphi method is "A structured method in which a panel of experts answers questionnaires iteratively over a few rounds" with "Anonymous summaries of responses are provided after each round to allow participants to revise responses and converge on answers". Evidence is defined as "Information on which a decision or guidance is based" and "Evidence is obtained from a range of sources, including randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and expert opinion of clinical professionals or patients". The GRADE Working Group "has developed a sensible and transparent framework for grading quality of evidence and strength of recommendations, typically referred to as 'GRADE' (or the GRADE system)". Harm is "A hurtful or adverse outcome of an action or event, or with regard to CPGs, a treatment or health care decision/recommendation, whether temporary or permanent". Pain constructs are specified: Neuropathic pain is "A type of pain that may be associated with nerve damage", nociceptive pain is "A type of pain that may be associated with overstimulation of the sensory neurons", and nociplastic pain is "A type of pain that is widespread and not due to tissue or nerve damage". Outcome is "A change resulting from an intervention" and in evaluations is "a potential consequence of an intervention that is measured after the intervention has been implemented and is used to assess the potential beneficial and harmful effects of the intervention". "Health outcomes, also referred to as Patient-Centered outcomes, are clinical outcomes that affect how patients feel, live or survive, such as quality of life, rate of survival, and patient satisfaction". "Patient-centeredness" is "Respect for and responsiveness to individual patient preferences, needs, and values; helps ensure that patient values and circumstances guide clinical decisions", and systematic review key questions "are developed using the PICOTS framework".

### The prevalence of probable neuropathic pain in the US: results from a multimodal general-population health survey [^11446dAS]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Nevertheless, there were respondents with probable NeP who reported pain types not typically associated with neuropathic symptoms. This finding is consistent with previous work. A different set of studies was conducted to determine the clinical presentation and burden of illness in six different NeP conditions: HIV NeP, posttrauma/postsurgical NeP, spinal cord injury with NeP, CLBP, painful diabetic neuropathy, and painful peripheral neuropathy with small-fiber involvement. In these studies, physicians and patients were required to answer questions regarding NeP, comorbid medical and psychiatric conditions, and medication to treat NeP. These studies noted an increased incidence of medical and psychiatric conditions that were a function of pain severity. These medical conditions included other NeP conditions, fibromyalgia, restless-leg syndrome, and painful conditions typically thought to be nociceptive, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, it is not surprising that patients with NeP report an increased incidence of other painful conditions, regardless of their origin.–It is also possible that the 80% specificityof PainDetect coded some nociceptive patients as false-positive NeP patients. If our findings are corroborated in future studies, this has important implications for general pain management and treatment.

### Proteomics in neuropathic pain research [^112RpgkF]. Anesthesiology (2008). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain is often caused by nerve injury or dysfunction in the peripheral and central nervous system and is frequently associated with allodynia and hyperalgesia. The underlying molecular mechanisms of neuropathic pain are largely unknown, and therefore, pharmacologic treatment is insufficient in many cases. To elucidate translational and posttranslational modifications in the nervous system that arise after nerve injury, a number of proteomic studies have been performed using different animal neuropathy models. The results of these proteomic approaches are summarized in this review to provide a better overview of proteins that are involved into the pathogenesis of nerve injury and neuropathic pain. This might allow a better understanding of the pathophysiologic signaling pathways in this impairment, facilitate the discovery of specific biomarkers, and thus promote the development of novel pain therapies.

### Harmonizing neuropathic pain research: outcomes of the london consensus meeting on peripheral tissue studies [^116AMdwe]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

In the case of the former, it was discussed that, for statistical purposes, many tissue studies probably would not be large enough to be powered for more than one outcome variable, hence deviation from core outcome sets could be justified in these specific cases. We discussed the absolute minimum data required for such studies in addition to NeupSIG grading, and agreed on age, biological sex, height, weight, a measure of pain severity to serve as the primary outcome, and some information on pain medications. Height and weight were considered more flexible measures than body mass index and therefore preferable. All agreed that it was vital that any pain assessment be specific to the site of neuropathy, for instance, in the context of typical diabetic neuropathy, enquire about pain in the feet. This is important because patients often experience other types of pain, eg, musculoskeletal. Similarly, it should be recorded how pain assessment related to the site of the tissue that was being harvested — perhaps with the help of a body map. There was much debate regarding the actual minimal pain severity metric to be used. Suggestions varied and included the total intensity score of the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory or an average numerical rating score of pain intensity over the past 24 hours, with the latter preferred by most of the group. In conditions with intermittent pain, this might have to be modified, eg, to ask about the intensity of the last attack or the frequency of attacks. Finally, regarding medications, as an absolute minimum, there was agreement that information was needed on past or present neurotoxic medications or treatments (eg, chemotherapy or radiotherapy), as well as current analgesics and strong immunomodulators like biologic therapies. Obviously, precise details on what might be most appropriate would depend on the neuropathic pain condition and tissue site under study. We recommend adapting a short record sheet that captures the minimal phenotyping information we just discussed, alongside a few additional example parameters (Supplementary File 2).

### Neuropathic pain in children [^115jko2w]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2014). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain (NP), due to a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system, is not well documented or researched in children. NP is a clinical diagnosis that can be difficult, especially in younger children. Nevertheless, it is important to recognise NP, as pain mechanisms and consequently management and prognosis differ from other types of long-term pain. NP is common in adult pain clinics but many of the underlying disease states in which it occurs are infrequently or never encountered in paediatric practice. However, NP in childhood has been reported, even in the very young in certain clinical situations. Causes of NP include traumatic injury, complex regional pain syndrome type II, cancer and chemotherapy, chronic infection, neurological and metabolic disease, and inherited sensory nerve dysfunction. The clinical and laboratory study of traumatic peripheral nerve injury has revealed important age-related differences in clinical presentation and prognosis. It is clear that mechanisms operating during development can profoundly modify the consequences of nerve damage and NP. Clinically, diagnosis, assessment and treatment of NP are based on methods and evidence derived from data in adults. Improvements in the understanding and management of NP are likely to come from developmentally appropriate improvements in the clarity and consistency of diagnosis and systematic, well-researched approaches to treatment.

### Peripheral neuropathic pain: a mechanism-related organizing principle based on sensory profiles [^116Pdd18]. Pain (2017). Low credibility.

1. Introduction

Neuropathic pain syndromes develop after a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory nervous system. Despite advances in understanding the complex neurobiology of pain, the pharmacological management of these syndromes remains insufficient and several promising drugs have failed in late-stage development. Thus, there is a need to predict treatment responders both for clinical practice, in which even first-line treatments are beneficial in less than 50% of patients, and for clinical trial design, in which a negative outcome may be due to a low responder rate rather than uniform inefficacy of the treatment.

Although all neuropathic pain disorders have a common denominator, ie, damage of the somatosensory nervous system, the underlying etiologies and pathogeneses of these damages are distinct. Furthermore, the patterns of sensory signs and symptoms that develop after neuropathy vary between the different etiologies and even between individual patients with neuropathies of the same etiology. The expression of these sensory signs, the mosaic of hyperalgesia, allodynia, and sensory loss, which we call the individual somatosensory profile, reflects pathophysiological mechanisms in damaged and surviving afferent nerve fibers such as conduction block, ectopic impulse generation, peripheral sensitization, and central sensitization.

Historically, neuropathic pain has been classified, investigated in clinical trials, and treated on the basis of the underlying etiology. However, recognising the heterogeneity of pain mechanisms other classification schemes might be more appropriate. Thus, an entirely different strategy in which pain is differentiated on the basis of the underlying mechanisms has been proposed emphasizing the rationale for a treatment approach directed at mechanisms rather than diseases.,

Pathophysiological mechanisms of pain generation cannot be readily examined in patients. Nevertheless, the expression of some sensory signs can be related to mechanisms, eg, heat hyperalgesia to peripheral sensitizationand pinprick hyperalgesia to central sensitization. Thus, the individual somatosensory profile may reveal some clues of pathophysiological dysfunctions of afferent processing.

The aim of this investigation was to identify patient subgroups with distinct sensory profiles in a large sample of patients with neuropathic pain from a wide range of etiologies collected in 3 multinational research networks. Instead of testing previously published hypotheses of associations between sensory profiles and mechanisms, this large data set enabled us to apply hypothesis-free statistical segmentation methods. This way we explored the intrinsic patterning of sensory profiles in a representative spectrum of patients with peripheral neuropathic pain. The number and type of intrinsic patterns — if reproducible — can then be related back to pathophysiological and pharmacological mechanisms in future studies.

### Neuropathic pain: an updated grading system for research and clinical practice [^111NDS8V]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

4.4. Summary

Compared to the grading system published in 2008, we have
(1) changed the order of the grading criteria to better reflect clinical practice.
(2) annotated the terms used to improve clarity.
(3) recognized the role of screening tools (questionnaires) in neuropathic pain evaluation.
(4) emphasized that reaching the final level of certainty (definite neuropathic pain) confirms clinically that a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system can explain the pain but, as often in neurology, it does not establish causality (ie, there may still be other causes of the pain such as a diabetic ulcer).

The main purpose of the grading system is to help in the classification of the pain as neuropathic. Other types of pain include nociceptive pain, which is pain that arises from actual or threatened damage to non-neural tissue and is due to the activation of nociceptors, and pain that does not fulfill the criteria for either nociceptive or neuropathic pain, such as chronic widespread pain, fibromyalgia, and irritable bowel syndrome. Furthermore, patients may have 2 or more types of pain, and the classification of pain may be particularly difficult if more than one type of pain exist in the same area.

The grading system is intended for use in individual patients in the clinic and for research, but not for classification of diseases. Some patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia may have small fiber pathology and may fulfill the criteria for neuropathic pain whereas others may not. In addition, patients with complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type II fulfill the criteria for neuropathic pain, whereas patients with type I do not. Complex regional pain syndrome type I is by definition a condition in which no nerve lesion can be verified. Although an inflammatory reaction, considered to be at the core of development of CRPS, can conceivably damage nociceptors, the current pathophysiological evidence for it is limited and inconsistent, and thus does not justify the designation by default of CRPS type I as neuropathic pain. Similarly, individual patients with Parkinson's disease may have neuropathic pain if there is a documented lesion of the somatosensory system and they fulfill the grading criteria, but musculoskeletal pain is an important differential diagnosis. The demonstration of reduced small nerve fibers obtained from skin biopsies in patients with fibromyalgia and Parkinson's disease is at the moment not sufficient evidence per se for labeling pain in these patients as neuropathic. There is currently no evidence to indicate that patients with cluster headache or migraine have lesions of the somatosensory system.

3. Minimal phenotyping

Phenotyping standards were discussed at length, and consensus outcomes are summarised in Table 1. The group agreed that neuropathic pain should be categorised using the updated International Association for the Study of Pain Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group (NeuPSIG) grading criteriaand assessed in accordance with the latest European Academy of Neurology, European Pain Federation (EFIC), and NeuPSIG guidelines. Ideally, a study on neuropathic pain would only include individuals that are graded as having a definite neuropathic pain diagnosis (and matched controls if the design requires). The label of "definite" necessitates pain and sensory signs in an anatomically plausible distribution and a diagnostic testto confirm a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system. However, the group acknowledged that a definite diagnosis may not always be possible because of time or financial constraints or because of the absence of a valid diagnostic test, eg, in the case of radicular pain. In those instances, we would recommend the inclusion of "probable neuropathic pain", ie, eliminating the need for a definitive diagnostic test, or at the very least, the correct grading of each participant according to the established criteria. Thus, at a minimum, a study should include information on the neuropathic pain grading determined for each participant, to enable later division of any study data into "possible", "probable", or "definite" neuropathic pain categories.

Table 1
Consensus recommendations for minimal, extended, and postmortem phenotyping.

Once neuropathic pain diagnosis is established, it was discussed that it would be valuable to start with domains that capture different aspects of the neuropathic pain experience. Core outcome sets for chronic pain have recently been agreed upon by the INTEGRATE-pain Consortium using a Delphi process. There was broad agreement that these would also be suitable for the purposes of studying local tissue dysregulation in neuropathic pain. For chronic pain, these must include a measure of pain intensity and interference, as well as assessment of how pain affects activities of daily living and quality of life. Beyond these broader recommendations, our group also converged on more specific suggestions regarding phenotyping in studies that involve local tissue. We split discussions into those studies that would use donated samples from living individuals vs postmortem designs.

### Painful peripheral neuropathy and its nonsurgical treatment [^111AAzWS]. Muscle & Nerve (2004). Low credibility.

Treatment of neuropathic pain is the primary focus of management for many patients with painful peripheral neuropathy. Antidepressants and anticonvulsants are the two pharmacological classes most widely studied and represent first-line agents in the management of neuropathic pain. The number of pharmacological agents that have demonstrated effectiveness for neuropathic pain continues to expand. In the current review, we summarize data from randomized, controlled pharmacological trials in painful peripheral neuropathies. Although neuropathic pain management remains challenging because the response to therapy varies considerably between patients, and pain relief is rarely complete, a majority of patients can benefit from monotherapy using a well-chosen agent or polypharmacy that combines medications with different mechanisms of action.

### Pharmacotherapy and non-invasive neuromodulation for neuropathic pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112PY1yN]. The Lancet: Neurology (2025). High credibility.

Background

There remains a substantial unmet need for effective and safe treatments for neuropathic pain. The Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group aimed to update treatment recommendations, published in 2015, on the basis of new evidence from randomised controlled trials, emerging neuromodulation techniques, and advances in evidence synthesis.

Methods

For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Embase, PubMed, the International Clinical Trials Registry, and ClinicalTrials.gov from data inception for neuromodulation trials and from Jan 1, 2013, for pharmacological interventions until Feb 12, 2024. We included double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials that evaluated pharmacological and neuromodulation treatments administered for at least 3 weeks, or if there was at least 3 weeks of follow-up, and which included at least ten participants per group. Trials included participants of any age with neuropathic pain, defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain. We excluded trials with enriched enrolment randomised withdrawal designs and those with participants with mixed aetiologies (ie, neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain) and conditions such as complex regional pain syndrome, low back pain without radicular pain, fibromyalgia, and idiopathic orofacial pain. We extracted summary data in duplicate from published reports, with discrepancies reconciled by a third independent reviewer on the platform Covidence. The primary efficacy outcome was the proportion of responders (50% or 30% reduction in baseline pain intensity or moderate pain relief). The primary safety outcome was the number of participants who withdrew from the treatment owing to adverse events. We calculated a risk difference for each comparison and did a random-effects meta-analysis. Risk differences were used to calculate the number needed to treat (NNT) and the number needed to harm (NNH) for each treatment. Risk of bias was assessed by use of the Cochrane risk of bias tool 2 and certainty of evidence assessed by use of GRADE. Recommendations were based on evidence of efficacy, adverse events, accessibility, and cost, and feedback from engaged lived experience partners. This study is registered on PROSPERO, CRD42023389375.

Findings

We identified 313 trials (284 pharmacological and 29 neuromodulation studies) for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Across all studies, 48 789 adult participants were randomly assigned to trial groups (20611 female and 25078 male participants, where sex was reported). Estimates for the primary efficacy and safety outcomes were tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) NNT = 4.6 (95% CI 3.2–7.7), NNH = 17.1 (11.4–33.6; moderate certainty of evidence), α2δ-ligands NNT = 8.9 (7.4–11.10), NNH = 26.2 (20.4–36.5; moderate certainty of evidence), serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) NNT = 7.4 (5.6–10.9), NNH = 13.9 (10.9–19.0; moderate certainty of evidence), botulinum toxin (BTX-A) NNT = 2.7 (1.8–9.61), NNH = 216.3 (23.5-∞; moderate certainty of evidence), capsaicin 8% patches NNT = 13.2 (7.6–50.8), NNH = 1129.3 (135.7-∞; moderate certainty of evidence), opioids NNT = 5.9 (4.1–10.7), NNH = 15.4 (10.8–24.0; low certainty of evidence), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) NNT = 4.2 (2.3–28.3), NNH = 651.6 (34.7-∞; low certainty of evidence), capsaicin cream NNT = 6.1 (3.1-∞), NNH = 18.6 (10.6–77.1; very low certainty of evidence), lidocaine 5% plasters NNT = 14.5 (7.8–108.2), NNH = 178.0 (23.9-∞; very low certainty of evidence). The findings provided the basis for a strong recommendation for use of TCAs, α2δ-ligands, and SNRIs as first-line treatments; a weak recommendation for capsaicin 8% patches, capsaicin cream, and lidocaine 5% plasters as second-line recommendation; and a weak recommendation for BTX-A, rTMS, and opioids as third-line treatments for neuropathic pain.

Interpretation

Our results support a revision of the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group recommendations for the treatment of neuropathic pain. Treatment outcomes are modest and for some treatments uncertainty remains. Further large placebo-controlled or sham-controlled trials done over clinically relevant timeframes are needed.

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^115eXqb5]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Quantifying the Consequences of Pain

Neuropathic pain can have a significant effect on mood and quality of life. This impact can be measured using the PainDETECT Questionnaire, the Pain Disability Index, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Test, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). These questionnaires can be completed at an initial consult to detect if such an impact is present, and thereafter, a more formal assessment can be done by the allied health professional team. The psychologist plays an important role in quantifying the degree of catastrophizing, impact on mood and quality of life, coping strategies, and kinesophobia. This is typically performed utilizing a range of validated scales that include the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, Pain Coping Inventory, and the Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia. The Brief Pain Inventory is used to assess condition-specific quality of life (QOL), and the EQ-5D or SF-36 assess overall health-related QOL.

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^113iKtZw]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

a) Medical history with clinical presentation

The working group decided to clarify the meaning of "history". Depending on medical or health speciality, the term "history" may be limited to temporal development of a presentation only or also include the full image of the clinical presentation. In the grading system, "history" refers to comprehensive information obtained both on temporal aspects as well as clinical presentation. In the case of radicular pain and painful radiculopathy, a specific cause or trigger for the onset of symptoms is often absent and symptoms may develop insidiously. Hence, a temporal relationship between the lesion or disease and the pain may not be apparent in some patients. Symptom descriptors, eg, pain descriptors, such as electric shocks, shooting, pins and needles, burning, and nonpainful sensations such as numbness and tingling, are suggestive, although not pathognomonic, of the presence of neuropathic pain, and could be taken into account. The combination of several symptom descriptors such as those used in neuropathic pain questionnaires has been shown by some to have a high discriminant value. In the absence of a clear temporal relationship between the lesion or disease and pain, the presence of multiple pain descriptors of neuropathic nature taken together with the presence of characteristic symptom behaviour (eg, spontaneous pain, aggravating and alleviating factors, relationship between lower back and leg pain) can be sufficient to fulfill criterion 1 (history of relevant neurological lesion or disease). The importance of symptom descriptors was already mentioned in the article of the revised grading system, but we have now made this explicit by incorporating them into the grading flow chart.

b) Pain distribution neuroanatomically plausible

The pain distribution should be consistent with the innervation territory of the suspected nerve root lesion/disease, although it has to be acknowledged that dermatomal distributions varyand extraterritorial spread may occur. In addition, a dermatomal distribution may be difficult to establish in patients with deep pain alone. As such, pain beyond traditional dermatomal territories can still be considered neuroanatomically plausible in people with radicular pain with or without radiculopathy.

### Translational neuropathic pain research [^113KXm1F]. Pain (2019). Medium credibility.

The traditional translational approach in neuropathic pain research has mainly consisted to date in translating basic findings from animal models of nerve injury to the clinic. Because of the difficulty to extrapolate mechanisms from animals to humans, an inverse translational approach ("top-down") has been advocated and contributed to the development of therapy. In particular, a number of treatments such as neurostimulation techniques have been initially assessed in patients and then translated to animal models for further investigation of their mechanisms. Therapeutic approaches based on an in-depth assessment of sensory phenotypes, suggestive of mechanisms, have also been implemented. The biggest trend in recent translational research is to investigate mechanisms or predict therapeutic response in patients by integrating multimodal approaches. The present narrative review emphasizes these various aspects of translational research in neuropathic pain.

### Location, location, location? is the pain of diabetic neuropathy generated by hyperactive sensory neurons? [^114o3xxv]. Diabetes (2013). Low credibility.

Peripheral hyperexcitability is an appealing mechanism that may contribute to pain in some diabetic patients and offers a therapeutic approach targeting glycosylated ion channels that may quickly alleviate pain, with improving glycemic control presumably being the preferred long-term goal. However, the diverse manifestations of painful diabetic neuropathy and variable responses to current drug interventions imply that a number of mechanisms can contribute, with each patient having a specific pathogenic profile. New clinical tests or biomarkers to identify the location of pain generation or amplification sites and specific pathogenic mechanisms would be valuable tools in guiding choice of therapy. The complexity of painful diabetic neuropathy may not be solved for all by a single intervention, making this condition a plausible archetype that could benefit from the emerging promise of personalized medicine.

### Neuropathic pain and spasticity: intricate consequences of spinal cord injury [^112AvntS]. Spinal Cord (2017). Low credibility.

Study Design

The 2016 International Spinal Cord Society Sir Ludwig Guttmann Lecture.

Objectives

The aim of this review is to identify different symptoms and signs of neuropathic pain and spasticity after spinal cord injury (SCI) and to present different methods of assessing them. The objective is to discuss how a careful characterization of different symptoms and signs, and a better translation of preclinical findings may improve our understanding of the complex and entangled mechanisms of neuropathic pain and spasticity.

Methods

A MEDLINE search was performed using the following terms: 'pain', 'neuropathic', 'spasticity', 'spasms' and 'spinal cord injury'.

Results

This review identified different domains of neuropathic pain and spasticity after SCI and methods to assess them in preclinical and clinical research. Different factors important for pain description include location, onset, pain descriptors and somatosensory function, while muscle tone, spasms, reflexes and clonus are important aspects of spasticity. Similarities and differences between neuropathic pain and spasticity are discussed.

Conclusions

Understanding that neuropathic pain and spasticity are multidimensional consequences of SCI, and a careful examination and characterization of the symptoms and signs, are a prerequisite for understanding the relationship between neuropathic pain and spasticity and the intricate underlying mechanisms.

### Neuropathic pain in CASPR2 antibody disease spectrum: a systematic review [^115JAZeR]. Journal of Neuroimmunology (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2) antibodies are mainly linked to acquired neuromyotonia, limbic encephalitis and Morvan syndrome. Nevertheless, neuropathic pain is increasingly reported, though data on its characteristics remain limited. Here, we describe a patient with isolated neuropathic pain associated with CASPR2 antibodies and we conducted a systematic review to better define this relevant presentation.

Methods

Index case was reported following CARE guidelines. The systematic review was performed on MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane, according to the updated PRISMA statement guidelines.

Results

The literature review identified 216 patients with neuropathic pain in the context CASPR2 antibody disease spectrum, with isolated pain described in only 16/216 (7.4%) cases. Pain was typically severe and presented as distal burning pain (74/147, 50.3%), widespread pain with myalgia and cramps (31/147, 21.1%), or severe back pain radiating to the legs (13/147, 8.8%). Peripheral nerve hyperexcitability was found in 50/76 (65.8%) of patients, while small nociceptive fiber dysfunction was identified in 16/19 (84.2%). Immunotherapy, especially second line treatments, improved pain in 85.4% (76/89) of cases, with complete remission of symptoms in 34/89 (38.2%), while symptomatic treatment helped 55.1% (27/49) of patients, with complete response in 10/49 (20.4%). Long-term therapy was often needed, and relapses occurred in 5.2% (5/96) after discontinuation.

Conclusions

Neuropathic pain appears to be a suggestive and relevant symptom in CASPR2 disease. Although rare, it can be the solely clinical feature of the disease. Testing for CASPR2 antibodies should be included in the screening of patients with neuropathic pain as in these cases rapid initiation of immunotherapy and escalation to second-line treatments can be highly effective.

Registration Information

The systematic review protocol was registered in the PROSPERO website [Protocol number CRD42024582950].

### A preliminary report on stem cell therapy for neuropathic pain in humans [^115De1MW]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Neuropathic pain is one of the most difficult chronic pain conditions to treat and affects approximately 6% of the population and can be caused by any number of events. Word descriptor qualities of neuropathic pain that patients report are typically sharp, shooting, burning, electric, or lancinating. The pathogenesis involves molecular changes (increased sodium channel density, expression of substance P and nerve growth factor), and cellular changes (neuroplasticity and central sensitization). Central sensitization provides an explanation for the dimensional increase of the pain field and temporal qualities observed in chronic pain patients. It is also well-established that the combined action of glial cells and cytokine modulated inflammation plays an important role in the development and progression of neuropathic pain.–Neuropathic pain typically presents in the clinic with hyperalgesia, allodynia, spontaneous ectopic discharges, secondary activation, and maintenance of sympathetically maintained pain and regional myofascial pain. Neuropathic trigeminal pain comprises several diagnostic states, including maxillofacial neuropathic pain from trauma, burning mouth syndrome, and atypical odontalgia (phantom tooth pain). Considering trigeminal neuropathy is a relatively localized form of neuropathic pain, patients with this pain state are considered an ideal group for the investigation of progressive new therapies.

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^112K7WD8]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

4.1.2. Radicular pain without radiculopathy

Radicular pain in the absence of a radiculopathy would not meet all the current grading scheme criteria for classification as neuropathic pain (see above for a lesion which is not detectable with sensory examination). This does not preclude the coexistence of nonneuropathic pain with other comorbid pain conditions (eg, somatic-referred pain).

4.1.3. Radicular pain with radiculopathy

Radicular pain with radiculopathy (painful radiculopathy) meets the current grading system criteria for classification as neuropathic pain, correlating with the ICD-11 definition of neuropathic pain in painful radiculopathy. This does not preclude the coexistence of neuropathic pain in this case with other nonneuropathic pain, eg, somatic-referred pain. Radiculopathy with only somatic-referred pain would not meet the current grading scheme criteria for neuropathic pain.

4.2. Adaptation of the neuropathic pain grading system to spine-related pain

The neuropathic pain grading systemwas developed to assist clinicians and researchers in determining whether patients have neuropathic pain (or a combination of another pain type and neuropathic pain) and the level of confidence associated with that decision. Based on clinical and laboratory examination findings, patients are classified as having no neuropathic pain or possible, probable, or definite neuropathic pain.

The requirements for possible neuropathic pain are as follows:
(1) History of relevant neurological lesion or disease and
(2) Pain distribution neuroanatomically plausible.

The requirement for probable neuropathic pain is that pain is associated with sensory signs in the same neuroanatomically plausible distribution. Alternatively, possible neuropathic pain with the absence of cutaneous sensory signs but with the presence of a confirmed diagnostic test is also classified as probable neuropathic pain.

### Trigeminal neuralgia: new classification and diagnostic grading for practice and research [^112fJZyp]. Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is an exemplary condition of neuropathic facial pain. However, formally classifying TN as neuropathic pain based on the grading system of the International Association for the Study of Pain is complicated by the requirement of objective signs confirming an underlying lesion or disease of the somatosensory system. The latest version of the International Classification of Headache Disorders created similar difficulties by abandoning the term symptomatic TN for manifestations caused by major neurologic disease, such as tumors or multiple sclerosis. These diagnostic challenges hinder the triage of TN patients for therapy and clinical trials, and hamper the design of treatment guidelines. In response to these shortcomings, we have developed a classification of TN that aligns with the nosology of other neurologic disorders and neuropathic pain. We propose 3 diagnostic categories. Classical TN requires demonstration of morphologic changes in the trigeminal nerve root from vascular compression. Secondary TN is due to an identifiable underlying neurologic disease. TN of unknown etiology is labeled idiopathic. Diagnostic certainty is graded possible when pain paroxysms occur in the distribution of the trigeminal nerve branches. Triggered paroxysms permit the designation of clinically established TN and probable neuropathic pain. Imaging and neurophysiologic tests that establish the etiology of classical or secondary TN determine definite neuropathic pain.

### Neuropathic pain: an updated grading system for research and clinical practice [^116zHmSD]. Pain (2016). Low credibility.

4.3. Definite neuropathic pain

The final level of certainty requires that an objective diagnostic test confirms the lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system. This may not always be possible in the nonspecialist environment. Examples of such diagnostic tests include computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or other imaging techniques to confirm the presence of stroke, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, or nerve lesion; skin biopsy showing reduced intraepidermal nerve fiber density, neurophysiological tests such as nerve conduction velocity, heat and laser evoked potentials, nerve excitability tests, R1 blink reflex demonstrating neural function compromise, microneurography with evidence of aberrant nociceptor activity; and genetic tests confirming a hereditary neuropathic pain disorder such as inherited erythromelalgia. In cases of amputation or a surgeon's clear verification of an intraoperative nerve lesion, further diagnostic tests are not necessary to arrive at the grading of "definite" neuropathic pain, because direct anatomical or surgical evidence counts as a confirmatory test.

This final level is reached by using only positive criteria for the location and nature of the neurological lesion or disease, without excluding other potential causes of the pain. Patients can have nociceptive pain in an area within the territory affected by an injury or disease involving the nervous system. Examples include spasticity-related pain below the level of injury in a patient with incomplete spinal cord injury, shoulder pain because of a lesion of the rotator cuff tendons in the area with sensory abnormalities after a stroke, inflammatory pain in the innervation territory of the lesioned nerves after thoracotomy or herniotomy, and plantar fasciitis in a patient with polyneuropathy. In these cases, despite fulfilling all 4 criteria of the grading system, the pain may still not be neuropathic. Thus, it is important to note that the final level does not completely rule out the possibility that other conditions such as tissue inflammation may fully or partially explain the pain. This remaining uncertainty about causality between the identified lesion or disease and the clinical presentation of the patient is a common situation in neurological diagnostics. In this context, the term definite neuropathic pain means that the clinician, by using history, clinical examination and auxiliary testing, is able to reach the level of confirming clinically that a patient has a neurological lesion that can explain the pain. Because the grading system only determines the level of certainty with which the presence or absence of a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system can explain the pain, it is always important to consider if other causes for the patient's pain conditions may be present.

### Acupuncture for neuropathic pain in adults [^116DSU9f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Neuropathic pain may be caused by nerve damage, and is often followed by changes to the central nervous system. Uncertainty remains regarding the effectiveness and safety of acupuncture treatments for neuropathic pain, despite a number of clinical trials being undertaken.

Objectives

To assess the analgesic efficacy and adverse events of acupuncture treatments for chronic neuropathic pain in adults.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, four Chinese databases, ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) on 14 February 2017. We also cross checked the reference lists of included studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with treatment duration of eight weeks or longer comparing acupuncture (either given alone or in combination with other therapies) with sham acupuncture, other active therapies, or treatment as usual, for neuropathic pain in adults. We searched for studies of acupuncture based on needle insertion and stimulation of somatic tissues for therapeutic purposes, and we excluded other methods of stimulating acupuncture points without needle insertion. We searched for studies of manual acupuncture, electroacupuncture or other acupuncture techniques used in clinical practice (such as warm needling, fire needling, etc).

Data Collection and Analysis

We used the standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The primary outcomes were pain intensity and pain relief. The secondary outcomes were any pain-related outcome indicating some improvement, withdrawals, participants experiencing any adverse event, serious adverse events and quality of life. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI), and for continuous outcomes we calculated the mean difference (MD) with 95% CI. We also calculated number needed to treat for an additional beneficial outcome (NNTB) where possible. We combined all data using a random-effects model and assessed the quality of evidence using GRADE to generate 'Summary of findings' tables.

Main Results

We included six studies involving 462 participants with chronic peripheral neuropathic pain (442 completers (251 male), mean ages 52 to 63 years). The included studies recruited 403 participants from China and 59 from the UK. Most studies included a small sample size (fewer than 50 participants per treatment arm) and all studies were at high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel. Most studies had unclear risk of bias for sequence generation (four out of six studies), allocation concealment (five out of six) and selective reporting (all included studies). All studies investigated manual acupuncture, and we did not identify any study comparing acupuncture with treatment as usual, nor any study investigating other acupuncture techniques (such as electroacupuncture, warm needling, fire needling). One study compared acupuncture with sham acupuncture. We are uncertain if there is any difference between the two interventions on reducing pain intensity (n = 45; MD -0.4, 95% CI -1.83 to 1.03, very low-quality evidence), and neither group achieved 'no worse than mild pain' (visual analogue scale (VAS, 0–10) average score was 5.8 and 6.2 respectively in the acupuncture and sham acupuncture groups, where 0 = no pain). There was limited data on quality of life, which showed no clear difference between groups. Evidence was not available on pain relief, adverse events or other pre-defined secondary outcomes for this comparison. Three studies compared acupuncture alone versus other therapies (mecobalamin combined with nimodipine, and inositol). Acupuncture may reduce the risk of 'no clinical response' to pain than other therapies (n = 209; RR 0.25, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.51), however, evidence was not available for pain intensity, pain relief, adverse events or any of the other secondary outcomes. Two studies compared acupuncture combined with other active therapies (mecobalamin, and Xiaoke bitong capsule) versus other active therapies used alone. We found that the acupuncture combination group had a lower VAS score for pain intensity (n = 104; MD -1.02, 95% CI -1.09 to -0.95) and improved quality of life (n = 104; MD -2.19, 95% CI -2.39 to -1.99), than those receiving other therapy alone. However, the average VAS score of the acupuncture and control groups was 3.23 and 4.25 respectively, indicating neither group achieved 'no worse than mild pain'. Furthermore, this evidence was from a single study with high risk of bias and a very small sample size. There was no evidence on pain relief and we identified no clear differences between groups on other parameters, including 'no clinical response' to pain and withdrawals. There was no evidence on adverse events. The overall quality of evidence is very low due to study limitations (high risk of performance, detection, and attrition bias, and high risk of bias confounded by small study size) or imprecision. We have limited confidence in the effect estimate and the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimated effect.

Authors' Conclusions

Due to the limited data available, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of acupuncture for neuropathic pain in general, or for any specific neuropathic pain condition when compared with sham acupuncture or other active therapies. Five studies are still ongoing and seven studies are awaiting classification due to the unclear treatment duration, and the results of these studies may influence the current findings.

Pain condition — A thorough history and physical examination must be documented to determine the type, cause, and nature of the pain, including questions about past investigations and interventions for pain, and a physical diagnosis must be established prior to initiating opioid therapy. The diagnosis should not be non-specific but should be objective and somewhat specific, guiding future treatments based on whether the pain is nociceptive, neuropathic, somatic, radicular, a combination of these, widespread, or localized, and the presence and extent of emotional pain also needs to be considered.

### Comprehensive evidence-based guidelines for implantable peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) in the management of chronic pain: from the American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians (ASIPP) [^1147KJ5F]. Pain Physician (2024). High credibility.

ASIPP PNS guidelines — impact of chronic peripheral neuropathic pain on health care resource utilization: Key Question 1 asks "What is the impact of chronic peripheral neuropathic pain or lumbar muscle degeneration on healthcare resource utilization?". Chronic pain is defined as "pain that extends beyond an expected timeframe of healing", and in 2011 chronic neuropathic pain was redefined as "pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system, including peripheral fibers and central neurons". In the United States, an estimated 20.9% of U.S. adults experienced chronic pain with 6.9% suffering high-impact chronic pain, as of 2021. Globally, neuropathic pain has been described as highly prevalent in 7% to 10% of the general population with 20% to 30% noting chronicity. Economic burden data show U.S. spending of $134.5 billion in 2016 for spinal pain, a 53.5% increase from 2013 when $87.6 billion was spent; costs for other musculoskeletal disorders increased 43.5%, from $183 billion in 2013 to $263 billion in 2016. In the United Kingdom, chronic pain was present in 51% of participants with an overall neuropathic pain prevalence of 9.2%. European burden data reported the highest prevalence in diabetic peripheral neuropathy (20% to 25%), followed by spinal nerve pain or radiculopathy (17% to 22%), with total cost varied €10,000 and 60% to 70% attributed to indirect costs; in the United States, indirect costs for neuropathic pain were estimated as high as U.S. $30,000 annually per patient.

### Recommendations for terminology and the identification of neuropathic pain in people with spine-related leg pain. outcomes from the neuPSIG working group [^114FdS7z]. Pain (2023). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Pain radiating from the spine into the leg is commonly referred to as "sciatica", "Sciatica" may include various conditions such as radicular pain or painful radiculopathy. It may be associated with significant consequences for the person living with the condition, imposing a reduced quality of life and substantial direct and indirect costs. The main challenges associated with a diagnosis of "sciatica" include those related to the inconsistent use of terminology for the diagnostic labels and the identification of neuropathic pain. These challenges hinder collective clinical and scientific understanding regarding these conditions. In this position paper, we describe the outcome of a working group commissioned by the Neuropathic Pain Special Interest Group (NeuPSIG) of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) which was tasked with the following objectives: (1) to revise the use of terminology for classifying spine-related leg pain and (2) to propose a way forward on the identification of neuropathic pain in the context of spine-related leg pain. The panel recommended discouraging the term "sciatica" for use in clinical practice and research without further specification of what it entails. The term "spine-related leg pain" is proposed as an umbrella term to include the case definitions of somatic referred pain and radicular pain with and without radiculopathy. The panel proposed an adaptation of the neuropathic pain grading system in the context of spine-related leg pain to facilitate the identification of neuropathic pain and initiation of specific management in this patient population.

### Neuropathic pain phenotyping by international consensus (neuroPPIC) for genetic studies: a neuPSIG systematic review, Delphi survey, and expert panel recommendations [^115ewB2q]. Pain (2015). Low credibility.

3.2.4. Perceived diagnostic certainty

Figure 3 shows the level of perceived diagnostic certainty, according to the neuropathic pain grading system, indicated by respondents for various assessment modalities used alone or in combination with each other. There was unanimous consensus that a combination of "additional investigations, clinical signs, symptoms, body chart, and patient history" provided a diagnosis of "definite" neuropathic pain. All respondents also indicated that combinations of: "additional investigations, clinical signs and symptoms", and "clinical signs, symptoms, body chart, and patient history" provided a diagnosis of at least "probable" neuropathic pain. The poorest perceived diagnostic certainty was associated with assessments that only included "additional investigations". The levels of agreement across each round of the survey are shown in Supplementary Digital Content 4 (available online as Supplemental Digital Content at).

Figure 3
Delphi survey: level of diagnostic certainty achieved by individual assessment types and combinations of these assessments when assessing whether a pain is "definite", "probable", or "possible" neuropathic pain. Results shown are after 2 rounds of the Delphi survey (n = 16 in the second round).

3.2.5. Additional phenotyping measures

The level of agreement on which measurements should be included in an assessment of neuropathic pain (in addition to symptoms, signs, and additional investigations) is shown in Table 5 (and Supplementary Digital Content 5, available online as Supplemental Digital Content at). After 2 rounds of the survey, there was strong consensus that assessment should include a history and a body chart to indicate pain distribution. Prompted by discussions at the consensus meeting (see below), in round 3 of the survey, we probed what the body chart and history should include. Having ≥ 70% of respondents in agreed or strong agreement, the strongest consensus was for the following items assessing patient history: "a previous diagnosis of neuropathic pain by another clinician" and "risk factors for having neuropathic pain" (see Supplementary Digital Content 6, available online as Supplemental Digital Content at). On the body chart of perceived pain, 75% (12/16) of respondents indicated that, in the event of more than 1 pain site, the "main pain and any other pains" should be identified. Almost two-thirds (64%, 9/14) believed that a checklist of body regions was a suitable substitute for a body chart cartoon.

### Neuropathic pain phenotyping by international consensus (neuroPPIC) for genetic studies: a neuPSIG systematic review, Delphi survey, and expert panel recommendations [^116emHLW]. Pain (2015). Low credibility.

Box 1
NeuroPPIC consensus statement on entry-level phenotyping for genetic studies of neuropathic pain in humans.

A neuropathic pain "control" would be negative for (1) and (2), but will be characterised as (3) as clinically relevant.

The panel agreed that if there are discrepancies between the findings from the screening tool, anatomical distribution, and patient history, then the participant should be excluded from the study. Overall, these 3 components only satisfy criteria 1 and 2 of the NeuPSIG grading system, and thus the level of diagnostic certainty achieved is "possible" neuropathic pain.

While acknowledging the lack of a "gold standard", we agreed that achieving greater diagnostic certainty (ie, "probable" or "definite" neuropathic pain) is desirable. Such greater diagnostic certainty requires additional assessments that confirm the presence of positive and/or negative sensory signs (for "probable" neuropathic pain) or provide direct evidence of a lesion to the somatosensory nervous system (for "definite" neuropathic pain) in the affected area. More extensive phenotyping could allow case stratification into additional pain phenotypes based on sensory and psychological parameters (eg, pain catastrophizers vs noncatastrophizers; pinprick hypoaesthesia vs pinprick hyperaesthesia).

The panel additionally agreed that it could not currently be prescriptive in the selection of additional phenotyping measures to use beyond determination of "caseness", as the choice was dependent on factors such as the feasibility of making measurements based on cost and practicality, the population and disease being studied (eg, central vs peripheral neuropathic pain), and the research question being addressed. However, choice of additional measures to use when assessing "caseness" should be consistent with the NeuPSIG grading system for neuropathic pain. See Supplementary Digital Content 7 for examples of additional phenotypes voiced at the meeting (available online as Supplemental Digital Content at).
