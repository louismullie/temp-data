## Question

Adult with schizophrenia on recently increased medication presents with fever, tachycardia, hypertension, rigidity, altered responsiveness, fixed head position; labs show leukocytosis and markedly elevated CK.

A 35-year-old male patient is brought into the emergency department by emergency medical services. The patient has a history of schizophrenia and is on medication per his mother. His mother also states that the dose of his medication was recently increased, though she is not sure of the specific medication he takes. His vitals are HR 110, BP 170/100, T 102.5, RR 22. On exam, he cannot respond to questions and has rigidity. His head is turned to the right and remains in that position during the exam. Labs are significant for a WBC count of 14,000 cells/mcL, with a creatine kinase (CK) level of 3,000 mcg/L. What is the best treatment for this patient?

Answer Choices:
A. Morphine
B. Dantrolene
C. Valproate
D. Lamotrigine

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking which medication is the best treatment for a 35-year-old man with schizophrenia who recently had an antipsychotic dose increase and now presents with fever, rigidity, altered mental status, autonomic instability, and markedly elevated CK, consistent with neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the diagnosis and its severity. Then, I should verify immediate management steps, including stopping the offending agent and supportive care. Next, I will evaluate pharmacologic options for rigidity and hyperthermia, especially dantrolene versus dopamine agonists. Finally, I will consider why the other choices are inappropriate and synthesize a practical, guideline-concordant recommendation with dosing and monitoring.

> Let me first confirm the diagnosis and severity. The patient has the classic tetrad of NMS: mental status change, fever, muscle rigidity, and autonomic dysfunction, with supportive labs showing leukocytosis and markedly elevated CK, and a temporal relationship to recent antipsychotic dose escalation, which aligns with consensus diagnostic criteria and FDA labeling across multiple antipsychotics, including haloperidol, olanzapine, and quetiapine [^1113NkYf] [^11588q7i] [^114Zqpif] [^111FcfiD]. Hold on, I should verify severity: temperature above 40°C and heart rate above 120 bpm would qualify as severe; here, 102.5°F (about 39.2°C) and HR 110 suggest moderate severity, which still warrants aggressive management and consideration of specific pharmacotherapies beyond supportive care alone [^1174x1wG].

> Next, I should review immediate management. I need to ensure the offending antipsychotic is stopped immediately, along with other nonessential dopamine-blocking agents, and initiate supportive care in a monitored setting with aggressive IV fluids, external cooling, benzodiazepines for agitation or catatonia, and close surveillance for rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, aspiration, and thromboembolism. This is standard across FDA labels and contemporary critical care guidance for NMS [^11588q7i] [^114Zqpif] [^111FcfiD] [^1174x1wG]. Wait, let me verify the role of benzodiazepines: lorazepam is reasonable in moderate cases to mitigate rigidity and catatonia while other therapies are arranged, though it is not definitive therapy for NMS itself [^116wuVzx].

> Now, I will examine pharmacologic options for rigidity and hyperthermia. Dantrolene directly reduces skeletal muscle rigidity and heat generation via ryanodine receptor blockade and is recommended in moderate-to-severe NMS, typically 1–2.5 mg/kg IV push followed by 0.5–1 mg/kg every 6 hours, with a usual ceiling around 10 mg/kg total. This is supported by pediatric critical care guidance and aligns with FDA labeling that acknowledges dantrolene as a commonly used agent despite limited controlled evidence [^112LoccA] [^116ku32W]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: dantrolene treats the muscle rigidity and hypermetabolism, but it does not reverse the underlying dopamine blockade, so it should be paired with supportive care and, in many cases, a dopamine agonist in moderate-to-severe presentations [^1174x1wG].

> I should also consider dopamine agonists. Bromocriptine or amantadine are reasonable adjuncts to restore dopaminergic tone; bromocriptine is often started at 1.25–2.5 mg twice daily and titrated up to 10 mg three times daily, while amantadine is commonly used at 100–200 mg twice daily, though evidence is largely from case series and expert consensus rather than RCTs, and they are particularly useful when rigidity and bradykinesia persist despite dantrolene and supportive measures [^112LoccA] [^116ku32W]. Let me reconsider timing: in moderate severity, starting both dantrolene and a dopamine agonist is reasonable, reserving ECT for refractory or life-threatening cases or when pharmacotherapy is contraindicated or ineffective [^116wuVzx].

> But wait, what about the provided options? Morphine is an opioid analgesic and has no role in treating NMS; it would not address rigidity, hyperthermia, or dopamine blockade and could worsen mental status and respiratory drive, so I should exclude it. Valproate is an anticonvulsant and mood stabilizer; it does not treat NMS and has even been implicated as a potential precipitant in case reports, so it is not appropriate here. Lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant with no evidence for NMS treatment and would not be expected to help rigidity or hyperthermia, so it should not be chosen [^113ZgqUM].

> I should double-check the comparative rationale. Dantrolene is the only option listed that directly targets the pathophysiology of muscle rigidity and hypermetabolism in NMS, which is why it is the best choice among the alternatives provided, even though it must be integrated with supportive care and, in moderate-to-severe cases, a dopamine agonist to address the underlying dopamine blockade. This approach is consistent with pediatric critical care guidance and with FDA labeling that recognizes dantrolene as a standard, albeit evidence-limited, option for NMS management [^112LoccA] [^116ku32W].

> Final answer: B. Dantrolene, with the immediate addition of supportive care and consideration of a dopamine agonist such as bromocriptine or amantadine for moderate-to-severe NMS, and close monitoring for complications including rhabdomyolysis and renal failure [^112LoccA] [^1174x1wG] [^116ku32W].

The best treatment for this patient with suspected neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is **immediate discontinuation of the antipsychotic** and **supportive care**, including aggressive cooling, IV fluids, and benzodiazepines for agitation or rigidity [^1174x1wG]. Dantrolene is the **most appropriate pharmacologic option** among the choices provided because it directly reduces muscle rigidity and hyperthermia, which are central to NMS pathophysiology [^112LoccA]. Morphine is not indicated, and valproate or lamotrigine are not treatments for NMS. Early recognition and prompt management are critical to reduce morbidity and mortality [^111NP4KG].

---

## Clinical diagnosis and severity assessment

The patient presents with the classic tetrad of NMS: **altered mental status, muscle rigidity, hyperthermia, and autonomic instability** (tachycardia, hypertension, diaphoresis) [^111NP4KG]. Laboratory findings of leukocytosis and markedly elevated CK further support the diagnosis [^1113NkYf]. The severity is **moderate to severe** given the high fever, significant rigidity, and autonomic instability, warranting aggressive management [^116wuVzx].

---

## Pathophysiology of neuroleptic malignant syndrome

NMS is thought to result from **dopamine blockade** in the central nervous system, leading to rigidity, hyperthermia, and autonomic instability [^1138F7Uo]. This dopamine blockade explains why dopamine agonists (e.g. bromocriptine) are often used in treatment [^116ku32W].

---

## Immediate management steps

### General supportive care

- **Discontinue antipsychotic**: Stop the offending antipsychotic immediately [^11588q7i].
- **Cooling measures**: Aggressive external cooling (ice packs, cooling blankets) to control hyperthermia [^112LoccA].
- **Intravenous fluids**: Aggressive IV hydration to prevent renal failure from rhabdomyolysis [^112LoccA].
- **Benzodiazepines**: Lorazepam or diazepam for agitation, rigidity, and anxiety [^116wuVzx].

---

### Pharmacologic interventions

Pharmacologic options include **dopamine agonists** (bromocriptine, amantadine) to restore dopamine activity and reduce rigidity and hyperthermia [^116ku32W], and **muscle relaxants** such as dantrolene to directly reduce muscle rigidity and hyperthermia [^112LoccA].

---

## Evaluation of answer choices

| **Answer choice** | **Mechanism of action** | **Relevance to nms** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Morphine | Opioid analgesic | Not indicated for NMS; may mask symptoms and worsen respiratory status | Not recommended |
| Dantrolene | Muscle relaxant; inhibits calcium release from sarcoplasmic reticulum | Directly reduces muscle rigidity and hyperthermia; central to NMS management | Recommended |
| Valproate | Anticonvulsant; mood stabilizer | No role in NMS; may worsen hyperthermia and hepatic function | Not recommended |
| Lamotrigine | Anticonvulsant; mood stabilizer | No role in NMS; no evidence of benefit | Not recommended |

---

## Clinical evidence supporting dantrolene

Dantrolene is **supported by clinical guidelines and case reports** as an effective treatment for NMS, particularly for reducing muscle rigidity and hyperthermia [^1174x1wG]. It is recommended in moderate to severe cases, especially when rigidity and hyperthermia are prominent [^116wuVzx].

---

## Potential risks and side effects of dantrolene

Dantrolene is generally well tolerated, but clinicians should monitor for **hepatotoxicity**, respiratory depression, and sedation. Regular monitoring of liver function tests is recommended during treatment.

---

## Conclusion and recommendation

The best treatment for this patient with suspected NMS is **immediate discontinuation of the antipsychotic**, aggressive supportive care, and dantrolene to manage rigidity and hyperthermia. Dantrolene is the most appropriate pharmacologic choice among the provided options because it directly addresses the core features of NMS.

### Malignant deep brain stimulator withdrawal syndrome [^117R4zFD]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Due to lack of a similar reported cases in the literature, unfamiliarity with this presentation among the medical team, and given no history of neuroleptics administration or withdrawal of dopaminergic medications prior to the onset of symptoms. It was not until day 9 postadmission that the diagnosis of PHS was made, after the patient continued to have non-resolving high fever, severe muscular rigidity, altered mental status, autonomic instability (hypertension up to 180/90 and tachycardia between 110 and 125 beats/min) and elevated creatine kinase (CK) to 1615 U/L. Subsequently, the patient was treated with intravenous fluids, acetaminophen and ice packs; levodopa dose was tripled, with no clinical improvement. Yet, transient resolution of fever was noted before it spiked again 2 days later (figure 1). Considering the unsatisfactory results of conservative management, lack of clinical improvement and given that the estimated DBS battery life is between 3 and 5 years, DBS withdrawal syndrome due to battery depletion was suspected. However, the Implantable Pulse Generator (IPG) replacement was not accomplished until day 17 of admission due to lack of similar reported cases and unavailability of supportive evidences in the literature. A few hours later following successful IPG replacement, clinical improvement was documented. After 1 day post IPG replacement, there was no more fever (figure 1) or autonomic instability; CK, white blood cell (WBC) count, creatinine level and CRP all normalised. The patient's rigidity and mental status improved to full recovery until discharge.

### Atypical neuroleptic malignant syndrome [^112vr7k4]. BMJ Case Reports (2016). Medium credibility.

A 57-year-old man was admitted to a psychiatric ward in a confused state. He had a 30-year history of lately stable schizophrenia and antipsychotic medication had recently been reduced. The clinical picture was characterised by confusion, agitation, autonomic instability, muscle rigidity and elevated creatine kinase. Despite no other identifiable cause, physicians were reluctant to accept a diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) due to the absence of fever. Despite acute renal failure, the patient was repeatedly transferred between medical and psychiatric wards; diagnosis and management were delayed, with potentially catastrophic consequences. NMS is a rare, life-threatening neurological disorder that can present atypically and requires emergency medical rather than psychiatric care. Clinicians must proactively distinguish between medical emergencies (including acute confusional states/delirium) and mental illness. Prompt, accurate diagnosis, management on the appropriate ward and effective teamwork between specialties are essential to improve patient outcomes in this potentially fatal condition.

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome following reintroduction of an antipsychotic after overdose [^112x781A]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We describe a case of NMS occurring in a patient with schizoaffective disorder after receiving excessive amounts of antipsychotic medication on two occasions within a 6-week period: the first in the context of an attempted suicide and the second following an accidental overdose due to an administration error.

According to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), diagnosis of NMS requires a patient to meet the following major criteria: (1) exposure to a dopamine blocking agent, (2) severe muscle rigidity and (3) fever, and at least 2 of 10 minor criteria. Our patient presented all of the major criteria, and seven of the minor criteria (raised CK, diaphoresis, tachycardia, increased blood pressure and heart rate, altered consciousness and leucocytosis). While the patient clearly displayed the classic features indicative of NMS, there are several atypical aspects of the case worthy of discussion.

Notably, the patient did not develop NMS until 2 months after the iatrogenic overdose of zuclopenthixol. This is surprising given that maximum serum concentration following intramuscular injection of zuclopenthixol acetate occurs after 24–48 hours, and plasma elimination half life is approximately 20 hours. Further, around the time of the medication error, additional risk factors for NMS were present, including concomitant treatment with two first-generation antipsychotics and psychomotor agitation. Instead, NMS occurred later while being prescribed a single antipsychotic (zuclopenthixol dihydrochloride) at a low dose.

In the present case, acute renal failure (ARF) and hepatic cytolysis were not the sequelae of NMS. Rather, they predated NMS, and therefore may have played a causative roleby impairing the metabolism and excretion of zuclopenthixol leading to elevated serum concentrations of the drug. Also of note, escitalopram, which is a cytochrome P450 2D6 enzyme inhibitor, was prescribed at the time NMS developed, and therefore may have contributed towards raised serum concentrations of zuclopenthixol.

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome with delayed onset of fever following risperidone administration [^117KWadY]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To report and discuss a case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) with delayed onset of fever in a patient taking risperidone.

Case Summary

A 59-year-old white female presented with progressive weakness, confusion, and disorientation 10 days after restarting risperidone 2 mg/day therapy for bipolar disorder. She had taken risperidone for several years prior to this episode and had stopped it for approximately 3 weeks; risperidone was discontinued on admission. The patient's creatine kinase (CK) level was elevated (901 IU/L; reference range 39–162) on admission and increased to 1991 IU/L the following day. She was initially afebrile and had no muscular rigidity. Elevated temperature (38.1 degrees C) did not occur until hospital day 2. The patient was successfully treated with diazepam, bromocriptine, and dantrolene and suffered no long-term sequelae.

Discussion

Other clinicians have reported atypical presentations of NMS in patients taking newer neuroleptic agents. Although this patient met diagnostic criteria for NMS, the hallmark symptoms of fever and muscle rigidity were delayed in onset. Also, the patient never remained febrile for more than 24 hours and her maximum temperature was only 38.6 degrees C. An objective causality assessment suggests that this case of NMS was probably related to restarting risperidone.

Conclusions

Because of the life-threatening nature of this syndrome, clinicians should consider NMS in afebrile patients presenting with diaphoresis, changes in level of consciousness, mutism, tremors, tachycardia, leukocytosis, and elevated CK levels.

### Prochlorperazine-induced neuroleptic malignant syndrome [^115vwPuT]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare yet severe condition typically associated with antipsychotic medications. Here, we present a case of NMS induced by prochlorperazine in a 76-year-old male with multiple comorbidities, aiming to delineate its clinical manifestation, diagnostic complexities, and treatment approaches. Our methodology involved a thorough documentation of the patient's medical history, initial symptoms, physical examination findings, laboratory results, diagnostic processes, and subsequent therapeutic interventions. The patient exhibited classic NMS symptoms, including fever, altered mental status, autonomic dysregulation, and generalized rigidity, consistent with diagnostic criteria. Notably, laboratory investigations failed to reveal the typical abnormalities often seen in NMS cases, highlighting the diverse presentation of this syndrome. Management strategies primarily focused on benzodiazepines and amantadine, leading to a gradual improvement in symptoms and eventual resolution of NMS. This underscores the critical role of early recognition and appropriate pharmacotherapy in managing prochlorperazine-induced NMS, even at standard dosage levels. The absence of characteristic laboratory findings in NMS poses challenges in diagnosis, necessitating a comprehensive clinical assessment for accurate identification. Moreover, this case emphasizes the need for further research to better understand the pathophysiology of prochlorperazine-induced NMS and optimize treatment protocols. In conclusion, our case report sheds light on the complexities surrounding NMS induced by prochlorperazine, emphasizing the importance of vigilant monitoring and tailored therapeutic strategies in mitigating its potentially life-threatening consequences.

### Chlorpromazine [^115HJKHW]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias).

The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.

The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.

If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.

5.4 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)

A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs, including quetiapine. Rare cases of NMS have been reported with quetiapine. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure.

### Evaluation and management of children with acute mental health or behavioral problems. part II: recognition of clinically challenging mental health related conditions presenting with medical or uncertain symptoms [^111NP4KG]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome — clinical features, incidence, mortality, and risk factors are detailed: "Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a potentially lethal syndrome consisting of the tetrad of mental status changes, fever, hypertonicity or rigidity, and autonomic dysfunction". Because "NMS can be difficult to recognize and attenuated or incomplete presentations are possible", "The incidence of NMS has been difficult to determine, with estimates ranging from 0.02% to 3%". Outcomes have improved: "mortality from NMS has decreased from 76% in the 1960s to < 10% to 15% more recently". For recognition, "Experts suggest considering NMS in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with fever and altered mental status who are taking or may have taken an antipsychotic". Demographically, "NMS affects patients of all ages, with an apparent predominance in young adults and male patients (2:1)". Risk factors include that "Coadministration of psychotropic agents seems to be an especially high risk factor for precipitating NMS; in 1 study, more than half of people with reported NMS cases were taking concomitant psychotropic agents", and "Other risk factors include dehydration, physical exhaustion, preexisting organic brain disease, and the use of long-acting depot antipsychotics". Notably, "Neither duration of exposure to the drug nor toxic overdoses of antipsychotics appear to be associated with NMS", and "reintroducing the original precipitating drug may not lead to a reoccurrence of NMS, although patients with a history of NMS are at increased risk of recurrence". Typical timing is that "The onset of NMS generally occurs within 7 days of starting or increasing antipsychotics and may last for 5 to 10 days even after the initiating agent is stopped", whereas with depot agents symptoms "may last longer, up to 15 to 30 days".

### An international consensus study of neuroleptic malignant syndrome diagnostic criteria using the Delphi method [^1113NkYf]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

The lack of generally accepted diagnostic criteria for neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) impedes research and clinical management of patients receiving antipsychotic medications. The purpose of this study was to develop NMS diagnostic criteria reflecting a broad consensus among clinical knowledge experts, represented by an international multispecialty physician panel.

Participants

Eleven psychiatrists, 2 neurologists, 2 anesthesiologists, and 2 emergency medicine specialists participated in a formal Delphi consensus procedure.

Evidence

A core bibliography consisting of 12 prominent, current reviews of the NMS literature was identified by an objective, comprehensive electronic search strategy. Each panel member was given a copy of these references and asked to examine them before commencing the survey process.

Consensus Process

After reviewing the core bibliography, panel members were asked to list any clinical signs or symptoms or diagnostic studies that they believed, on the basis of their knowledge and clinical experience, were useful in making a diagnosis of NMS. In subsequent survey rounds, panel members assigned priority points to these items, and items that failed to receive a minimum priority score were eliminated from the next round. Information about individual panel member responses was fed back to the group anonymously in the form of the group median or mean and the number of members who had ranked or scored each survey item. The a priori consensus endpoint was defined operationally as a change of 10% or less in the mean priority score for any individual item, and an average absolute value change of 5% or less across all items, between consecutive rounds. The survey was conducted from January 2009 through September 2009.

Results

Consensus was reached on the fifth round regarding the following criteria: recent dopamine antagonist exposure, or dopamine agonist withdrawal; hyperthermia; rigidity; mental status alteration; creatine kinase elevation; sympathetic nervous system lability; tachycardia plus tachypnea; and a negative work-up for other causes. The panel also reached a consensus on the relative importance of these criteria and on the following critical values for quantitative criteria: hyperthermia, > 100.4°F or > 38.0°C on at least 2 occasions; creatine kinase elevation, at least 4 times the upper limit of normal; blood pressure elevation, ≥ 25% above baseline; blood pressure fluctuation, ≥ 20 mm Hg (diastolic) or ≥ 25 mm Hg (systolic) change within 24 hours; tachycardia, ≥ 25% above baseline; and tachypnea, ≥ 50% above baseline.

Conclusions

These diagnostic criteria significantly advance the field because they represent the consensus of an international multispecialty expert panel, include critical values, provide guidance regarding the relative importance of individual elements, and are less influenced by particular theoretical biases than most previously published criteria. They require validation before being applied in clinical settings.

### Carbidopa and levodopa (parcopa) [^113pBzu4]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)

Sporadic cases of a symptom complex resembling NMS have been reported in association with dose reductions or withdrawal of therapy with carbidopa-levodopa. Therefore, patients should be observed carefully when the dosage of PARCOPA®is reduced abruptly or discontinued, especially if the patient is receiving neuroleptics.

NMS is an uncommon but life-threatening syndrome characterized by fever or hyperthermia. Neurological findings, including muscle rigidity, involuntary movements, altered consciousness, mental status changes; other disturbances, such as autonomic dysfunction, tachycardia, tachypnea, sweating, hyper- or hypotension; laboratory findings, such as creatine phosphokinase elevation, leukocytosis, myoglobinuria, and increased serum myoglobin have been reported.

The early diagnosis of this condition is important for the appropriate management of these patients. Considering NMS as a possible diagnosis and ruling out other acute illnesses

(e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) is essential. This may be especially complex if the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.

The management of NMS should include: 1) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring and 2) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. Dopamine agonists, such as bromocriptine, and muscle relaxants, such as dantrolene, are often used in the treatment of NMS, however, their effectiveness has not been demonstrated in controlled studies.

### Immunomodulatory effects of clozapine and their clinical implications: what have we learned so far? [^113J2o3A]. Schizophrenia Research (2012). Low credibility.

Clozapine remains the drug of choice for treatment resistant schizophrenia, but is associated with potentially life threatening side effects, including agranulocytosis and myocarditis. Immunological mechanisms may be involved in the development of these side effects or in the unique antipsychotic efficacy in subgroups of schizophrenia patients. This systematic review presents the immunomodulatory effects of clozapine from human in vitro and in vivo studies and relates these findings to the developments of adverse and therapeutic effects of clozapine. Several studies confirm the immunomodulatory actions of clozapine, but only few studies investigated their relationship to the unique adverse and therapeutic effects of clozapine. During the first month of clozapine treatment, up to 50% of patients develop fever and flu like symptoms, which is seemingly driven by increased cytokines. Within the same time period, the risk of side-effects with a suspected immunological mechanism peaks. Patients developing fever during the first weeks of treatment should have a thorough physical examination, and measurements of white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count, ECG, C-reactive protein, creatinine kinase, and troponin to exclude infection, agranulocytosis, myocarditis and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. To what degree the unique antipsychotic efficacy of clozapine in subgroups of schizophrenia patients is related to its immunomodulatory effects has not been studied. Research relating the immunomodulatory actions of clozapine and its early markers to clinically relevant adverse and therapeutic outcomes is hoped to provide new leads for the understanding of the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and aid the development of novel treatment targets.

Clozapine — regulatory requirements, adverse effects, and patient-centered considerations — requires via the FDA a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) with registration of prescribers, pharmacies, and recipients and adherence to blood testing before prescribing and dispensing, and Black Box warnings include orthostatic hypotension, bradycardia and syncope, myocarditis and cardiomyopathy, and a dose-related increased risk of seizures. A systematic review (SR) comparing clozapine with other antipsychotic medications as a group found seizures, sialorrhea, tachycardia, fever, dizziness, and sedation more common with clozapine, while insomnia was more common with other antipsychotic medications and weight gain did not differ among medications, with the GRADE rating for differences in adverse effects described as moderate. Pairwise SR comparisons indicated extrapyramidal symptoms were more common with risperidone than clozapine and weight gain more common with clozapine than risperidone, with the GRADE rating for pairwise adverse effect comparisons ranging from very low to moderate; neither SR provided data on rare but potentially severe adverse events such as agranulocytosis, myocarditis, and cardiomyopathy, which are more common with clozapine, or neuroleptic malignant syndrome, which is more common with other antipsychotic medications. Patient preferences vary significantly; a patient focus group emphasized treatment goals encompassing being able to live, work, and learn, noted alignment with use of clozapine for people with treatment-resistant schizophrenia, and highlighted anxiety about rare but potentially serious adverse effects and the increased monitoring needed, with psychoeducation and shared decision making described as vehicles to address variation in values and achieve patient-centered goals.

Hyperpyrexia and Confusion

Sporadic cases of a symptom complex resembling neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) have been reported in association with dose reductions or withdrawal of certain antiparkinsonian agents such as levodopa, carbidopa-levodopa, or carbidopa-levodopa extended release. Therefore, patients should be observed carefully when the dosage of levodopa or carbidopa-levodopa is reduced abruptly or discontinued, especially if the patient is receiving neuroleptics.

NMS is an uncommon but life-threatening syndrome characterized by fever or hyperthermia. Neurological findings, including muscle rigidity, involuntary movements, altered consciousness, mental status changes; other disturbances, such as autonomic dysfunction, tachycardia, tachypnea, sweating, hyper- or hypotension; laboratory findings, such as creatine phosphokinase elevation, leukocytosis, myoglobinuria, and increased serum myoglobin, have been reported.

The early diagnosis of this condition is important for the appropriate management of these patients. Considering NMS as a possible diagnosis and ruling out other acute illnesses (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) is essential. This may be especially complex if the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever, and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.

The management of NMS should include: 1) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring and 2) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. Dopamine agonists, such as bromocriptine, and muscle relaxants, such as dantrolene, are often used in the treatment of NMS; however, their effectiveness has not been demonstrated in controlled studies.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) — NMS is a potentially lethal condition consisting of the tetrad of mental status changes, fever, muscular hypertonicity or rigidity, and autonomic dysfunction caused by central dopamine deficiency and can occur with any antipsychotic. NMS occurs idiosyncratically but is most common within 7 days of starting or increasing antipsychotic doses and later (15–30 days) if depot medications have been used. In addition to the classic tetrad, symptoms can include tachycardia, blood pressure instability, diaphoresis, pallor, cardiac dysrhythmia, sialorrhea, dysphagia, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, thromboembolic events, hypoventilation, and respiratory failure. NMS is a clinical diagnosis, because there are no pathognomonic clinical or laboratory criteria. Treatment may include supportive measures, such as removal of the initiating agent, and may also include intravenous fluids for dehydration and rhabdomyolysis, benzodiazepines for agitation, external cooling measures, and cardiorespiratory support; the smooth muscle relaxant dantrolene may be used to directly treat the abnormal muscle contractions of NMS. The utility of central nervous system dopaminergic agents, such as bromocriptine and amantadine, is less clear and controversial, and potential resources include toxicologists, a poison control center, and the NMS Information Service (http://www.nmsis.org/index.asp).

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)

A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status (including catatonic signs) and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis) and acute renal failure.

The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms. Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.

The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.

If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the potential reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.

Hyperpyrexia and heat stroke, not associated with the above symptom complex, have also been reported with haloperidol.

Neurological Adverse Reactions in Patients with Parkinson's Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies

Patients with Parkinson's Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies are reported to have an increased sensitivity to antipsychotic medication. Manifestations of this increased sensitivity with haloperidol treatment include severe extrapyramidal symptoms, confusion, sedation, and falls. In addition, haloperidol may impair the antiparkinson effects of levodopa and other dopamine agonists. Haloperidol is contraindicated in patients with Parkinson's Disease or Dementia with Lewy Bodies (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

Hypersensitivity Reactions

There have been postmarketing reports of hypersensitivity reactions with haloperidol. These include anaphylactic reaction, angioedema, dermatitis exfoliative, hypersensitivity vasculitis, rash, urticaria, face edema, laryngeal edema, bronchospasm, and laryngospasm (see ADVERSE REACTIONS). Haloperidol is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to this drug (see CONTRAINDICATIONS).

### Malignant deep brain stimulator withdrawal syndrome [^111NAdsm]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Discussion

PHS is a medical emergency described in patients with PD. This syndrome was first shown in a PD patient in 1981 after discontinuation of his anti-Parkinson's medications even though no neuroleptics were prescribed. It is not uncommon to misdiagnose PHS because of the overlapping symptoms with advanced PD and sepsis. The classic presentation include muscle rigidity, tremors, rapidly evolving fever, autonomic instability, reduced mental status, diaphoresis, elevated CRP, high CK due to rhabdomyolysis and increase in WBC counts. The exact pathogenesis behind the development of PHS remains unclear. A growing body of evidence suggests acute reduction of neurotransmission in the hypothalamus, nigrostriatal system and mesocortical dopaminergic system contributing to the development of PHS. Complications of PHS include aspiration pneumonia, renal failure due to rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation and venous thromboembolism. In addition, patients may develop a potentially fatal CNS; hypodopaminergic crisis within hours to days. Supportive management and reinitiation of dopaminergic medications are the core stones of treatment.

### Atypical neuroleptic malignant syndrome in an incarcerated patient: a demographic who may be at increased risk [^111Wqgi9]. BMJ Case Reports (2024). High credibility.

An incarcerated male patient with a psychiatric history of schizoaffective disorder presented to the emergency department with muscle rigidity and mutism after receiving a 150 mg haloperidol decanoate injection. At the peak of his illness, symptoms included muscular rigidity, mutism, excessive drooling, an altered level of consciousness, tachycardia, diaphoresis and tremors. Atypical neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) was diagnosed after discrediting similar illnesses through clinical reasoning, laboratory and imaging studies. He was successfully treated during a 40-day hospitalisation with lorazepam, amantadine, methocarbamol and supportive care. This case represents an atypical presentation of NMS due to the patient's lack of fever development. Nonetheless, he satisfied many other criteria, most notably rapid symptom onset after receiving a first-generation antipsychotic medication. The case also provides an opportunity to discuss the prevalence of psychiatric illness among the US incarcerated population and incarceration as a risk factor for developing NMS.

### Managing an effective treatment for neuroleptic malignant syndrome [^115RnUAB]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a rare, but sometimes fatal, adverse reaction to neuroleptics. It is characterized principally by fever and muscle rigidity. Furthermore, signs such as altered consciousness, autonomic instability, and laboratory findings such as elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK), leukocytosis, raised liver enzymes, and low serum iron or potassium levels are also found (serum iron and potassium levels differ in the sets of diagnostic criteria according to several authors). NMS is observed mainly in patients treated with neuroleptics, especially with high-potency neuroleptics, atypical neuroleptics, low-potency D2-receptor antagonists such as metoclopramide and tricyclic antidepressants, or after withdrawal of antiparkinsonians. Because clinical NMS studies have been conducted mainly in psychiatric units, it has been suggested that special attention to cancer patients undergoing psychopharmacologic treatment is necessary even in oncologic practice.

WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
- Angioedema can occur, and may be associated with life-threatening respiratory compromise requiring emergency treatment. Discontinue pregabalin immediately in these cases.
- Hypersensitivity reactions can occur. Discontinue pregabalin immediately in these patients.
- **Respiratory depression**: May occur with pregabalin, when used with concomitant CNS depressants or in the setting of underlying respiratory impairment. Monitor patients and adjust dosage as appropriate.
- Pregabalin may cause dizziness and somnolence and impair patients' ability to drive or operate machinery.
- Pregabalin may cause peripheral edema. Exercise caution when co-administering pregabalin and thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agents.

ADVERSE REACTIONS Most common adverse reactions in adults are dizziness, somnolence, dry mouth, edema, blurred vision, weight gain, and thinking abnormal. Most common adverse reactions in pediatric patients for the treatment of partial-onset seizures are increased weight and increased appetite.

0.

24% among 16, 029 placebo-treated patients, representing an increase of approximately one case of suicidal thinking or behavior for every 530 patients treated. There were four suicides in drug-treated patients in the trials and none in placebo-treated patients, but the number is too small to allow any conclusion about drug effect on suicide. The relative risk for suicidal thoughts or behavior was higher in clinical trials for epilepsy than in clinical trials for psychiatric or other conditions, but the absolute risk differences were similar for the epilepsy and psychiatric indications. Anyone considering prescribing pregabalin or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior with the risk of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behavior.

Should suicidal thoughts and behavior emerge during treatment, the prescriber needs to consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated. Following abrupt or rapid discontinuation of pregabalin, some patients reported symptoms including insomnia, nausea, headache, anxiety, hyperhidrosis, and diarrhea. Suicidal behavior and ideation have also been reported in patients after discontinuation of pregabalin. If pregabalin is discontinued, taper the drug gradually over a minimum of 1 week rather than discontinue the drug abruptly. 5.

### Fever, tachycardia, and hypertension with acute catatonic schizophrenia… [^112VBdUb]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

Fever, tachycardia, and hypertension developed concurrently with the administration of thiothixene during an acute episode of agitation in a case of catatonic schizophrenia. No cause for the fever or hyperkinetic state was found, and the syndrome resolved spontaneously one week after antipsychotic drug therapy was halted. This case appears to be an example of "acute lethal catatonia" or the neuroleptic "malignant" syndrome, both of which may be due to disturbances of dopamine function within the CNS. Such cases are rare, but may be dramatic in their presentation; however, antipsychotic drugs must be withheld during the duration of the disorder. McAllister RG.

### Amantadine hydrochloride [^116ku32W]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

Amantadine hydrochloride should not be discontinued abruptly in patients with Parkinson's disease since a few patients have experienced a parkinsonian crisis, i.e., a sudden marked clinical deterioration, when this medication was suddenly stopped. The dose of anticholinergic drugs or of amantadine hydrochloride should be reduced if atropine-like effects appear when these drugs are used concurrently. Abrupt discontinuation may also precipitate delirium, agitation, delusions, hallucinations, paranoid reaction, stupor, anxiety, depression and slurred speech.

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)

Sporadic cases of possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) have been reported in association with dose reduction or withdrawal of amantadine hydrochloride therapy. Therefore, patients should be observed carefully when the dosage of amantadine hydrochloride is reduced abruptly or discontinued, especially if the patient is receiving neuroleptics.

NMS is an uncommon but life-threatening syndrome characterized by fever or hyperthermia; neurologic findings including muscle rigidity, involuntary movements, altered consciousness; mental status changes; other disturbances such as autonomic dysfunction, tachycardia, tachypnea, hyper- or hypotension; laboratory findings such as creatine phosphokinase elevation, leukocytosis, myoglobinuria, and increased serum myoglobin.

The early diagnosis of this condition is important for the appropriate management of these patients. Considering NMS as a possible diagnosis and ruling out other acute illnesses (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) is essential. This may be especially complex if the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.

The management of NMS should include: 1) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 2) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. Dopamine agonists, such as bromocriptine, and muscle relaxants, such as dantrolene are often used in the treatment of NMS; however, their effectiveness has not been demonstrated in controlled studies.

Renal disease

Because amantadine hydrochloride is mainly excreted in the urine, it accumulates in the plasma and in the body when renal function declines. Thus, the dose of amantadine hydrochloride should be reduced in patients with renal impairment and in individuals who are 65 years of age or older (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Dosage for Impaired Renal Function).

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome

NMS is a rare and potentially lethal idiosyncratic reaction to treatment with dopamine antagonists. Like malignant catatonia, NMS involves altered consciousness with catatonia, muscle rigidity, hyperthermia and autonomic dysfunction. Recent reports suggest a prevalence of 0.02–0.03%, much lower than the 1–3% reported in the 1980s. Mortality has declined over the years to an average of less than 10%. Virtually, all classes of drugs that induce dopamine receptor blockade have been implicated in causing NMS, with antipsychotics that have higher affinity for the D 2 receptor posing the greatest risk. However, SGAs have also been associated with NMS, although they may result in an 'atypical' presentation with less severe or absent rigidity or hyperthermia. NMS may also occur with dopamine-blocking drugs used as antiemetics, with dopamine depleting drugs, and during dopamine agonist withdrawal. About two-thirds of cases develop within the first 1–2 weeks after drug initiation. Laboratory abnormalities are nonspecific but commonly include elevated serum CK, leucocytosis and low serum iron resembling malignant catatonia.

### Ziprasidone-and lithium-induced neuroleptic malignant syndrome [^112o9jvh]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of ziprasidone- and lithium-induced neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).

Case Summary

A 47-year-old white male with a history of schizoaffective disorder was admitted to the hospital due to an exacerbation of severe mania. He had been taking lithium 450 mg twice daily and divalproex sodium 750 mg/day. On hospital day 2, ziprasidone 80 mg twice daily was added, and as-needed doses of intramuscular ziprasidone 20 mg and lorazepam 2 mg were used for agitation. On day 6, the patient developed hyperthermia (39.4 degrees C), elevated creatine kinase 26,000 units/L and white blood cell (WBC) count (20.7 × 10³/microL), myoglobinuria, hypotension (68/40 mm Hg), altered mental status, and tachypnea (28 breaths/min). This case is notable for the absence of muscle rigidity, which presents in greater than 90% of patients with NMS taking traditional antipsychotics.

Discussion

This case of ziprasidone- and lithium-induced NMS is of probable cause, as determined by the Naranjo probability scale. The patient presented with symptoms consistent with NMS 4 days after initiation of ziprasidone and lithium. The majority of NMS cases present with the core features of hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, and elevated CK levels. Other frequently seen symptoms include altered mental status, tachypnea, tachycardia, elevated WBC count, hypotension, diaphoresis, and myoglobinuria. Our patient presented with 2 of the core symptoms, but did not develop muscle rigidity at any time. NMS criteria include muscle rigidity as one of the major presenting symptoms. Recent literature suggests that perhaps NMS due to novel antipsychotics presents with less muscle rigidity than is seen with traditional agents due to their lower affinity for the dopamine D2 receptor.

Conclusions

This case illustrates that NMS due to the novel antipsychotic ziprasidone may present with many of the core symptoms of the syndrome, but possibly less muscle rigidity than is seen with traditional agents.

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome associated with the use of prochlorperazine in a patient with a recent history of antipsychotic-induced neuroleptic malignant syndrome [^114rThbf]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe a case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) associated with the use of prochlorperazine in a patient recently hospitalized for NMS secondary to olanzapine.

Case Summary

A 28-year-old African American male with a history of schizophrenia was hospitalized 22 days prior to the current admission for an episode of olanzapine-induced NMS. The patient was discharged from our hospital to an outside psychiatric facility. At this facility, the patient developed nausea and was given 2 doses (unknown amount and route) of prochlorperazine. Over the next 24 hours, the patient exhibited signs and symptoms of NMS including fever, agitation, and muscle rigidity. He was transported to the emergency department and became increasingly agitated. Upon admission, the patient was hyperthermic (rectal temperature 39 °C) and tachycardic (heart rate 138 beats/min), with an elevated white blood cell count of 13.5 × 10³/μL, creatine kinase 431 units/L, serum sodium 150 mEq/L, blood urea nitrogen 25 mg/dL, and creatinine 1.1 mg/dL. A diagnosis of NMS was speculated and infectious causes were excluded. The patient was treated with aggressive fluid resuscitation and rapid cooling measures, as well as bromocriptine and lorazepam. Cooling measures were used for 48 hours, during which time the creatine kinase, white blood cell count, sodium, blood urea nitrogen, and creatinine gradually normalized. The patient was discharged to a psychiatry facility with a treatment regimen of oxcarbazepine 600 mg twice daily, lorazepam 2 mg 3 times daily, and clozapine 25 mg at bedtime, which was titrated over 2 months to 200 mg twice daily. There have been no further occurrences of NMS.

Discussion

The patient had all of the major characteristics of NMS with no other likely causative factors that may have contributed to his illness. Use of the Naranjo probability scale suggested that NMS was probably related to prochlorperazine. This case highlights the potential increased risk with the use of prochlorperazine in a patient with a history of olanzapine-induced NMS.

Conclusions

NMS should be considered as a rare complication of therapy with antipsychotics and agents that alter dopamine activity, especially in patients with a history of the syndrome. Careful consideration should be given regarding the risks and benefits of using non-antipsychotic dopamine antagonists in patients with a history of antipsychotic-induced NMS.

### Potentially fatal outcomes associated with clozapine [^1153HKCr]. Schizophrenia Research (2018). Low credibility.

Clozapine has been shown to be the most efficacious therapy for treatment resistant schizophrenia, estimated at one third of all schizophrenia cases. There is significant morbidity and mortality associated with clozapine including risk of agranulocytosis, aspiration pneumonia, bowel ischemia, myocarditis, seizures, and weight gain. Here we present a case of a 62-year-old man with chronic paranoid schizophrenia refractory to numerous antipsychotics who was started on clozapine therapy during an acute inpatient psychiatric admission. Within three weeks of starting clozapine, the patient developed flu-like symptoms, pleuritic chest pain, and was sent to a medical hospital for evaluation. After transfer, the patient had a rapidly deteriorating course with newly developed congestive heart failure, acute respiratory failure requiring intubation, and cardiovascular collapse requiring vasopressors. The patient expired within two days of transfer and four days after initial symptoms developed. The underlying etiology in this case is likely clozapine induced myocarditis leading to rapid cardiovascular collapse and death. Mortality with clozapine induced myocarditis has been estimated up to 24%. Given that 90% of clozapine cardiotoxic sequelae are seen in the first month post-initiation, more rigorous post-initiation surveillance is recommended for the first four weeks of clozapine with weekly cardiac enzymes (troponins, creatinine kinase-MB), EKG, and acute inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate).

### Amantadine hydrochloride (amantadine HCl) [^115k6RPJ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PRECAUTIONS

Amantadine Hydrochloride should not be discontinued abruptly in patients with Parkinson's disease since a few patients have experienced a parkinsonian crisis, i.e., a sudden marked clinical deterioration, when this medication was suddenly stopped. The dose of anticholinergic drugs or of amantadine hydrochloride should be reduced if atropine-like effects appear when these drugs are used concurrently. Abrupt discontinuation may also precipitate delirium, agitation, delusions, hallucinations, paranoid reaction, stupor, anxiety, depression and slurred speech.

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS): Sporadic cases of possible Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) have been reported in association with dose reduction or withdrawal of amantadine hydrochloride therapy. Therefore, patients should be observed carefully when the dosage of amantadine hydrochloride is reduced abruptly or discontinued, especially if the patient is receiving neuroleptics.

NMS is an uncommon but life-threatening syndrome characterized by fever or hyperthermia; neurologic findings including muscle rigidity, involuntary movements, altered consciousness; mental status changes; other disturbances such as autonomic dysfunction, tachycardia, tachypnea, hyper- or hypotension; laboratory findings such as creatine phosphokinase elevation, leukocytosis, myoglobinuria, and increased serum myoglobin.

The early diagnosis of this condition is important for the appropriate management of these patients. Considering NMS as a possible diagnosis and ruling out other acute illnesses (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) is essential. This may be especially complex if the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.

### Perphenazine [^112bDMEw]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS)

A potentially fatal symptom complex, sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), has been reported in association with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmias).

The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.

The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of antipsychotic drugs and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.

If a patient requires antipsychotic drug treatment after recovery from NMS, the reintroduction of drug therapy should be carefully considered. The patient should be carefully monitored, since recurrences of NMS have been reported.

If hypotension develops, epinephrine should not be administered since its action is blocked and partially reversed by perphenazine. If a vasopressor is needed, norepinephrine may be used. Severe, acute hypotension has occurred with the use of phenothiazines and is particularly likely to occur in patients with mitral insufficiency or pheochromocytoma. Rebound hypertension may occur in pheochromocytoma patients.

Perphenazine products can lower the convulsive threshold in susceptible individuals; they should be used with caution in alcohol withdrawal and in patients with convulsive disorders. If the patient is being treated with an anticonvulsant agent, increased dosage of that agent may be required when perphenazine products are used concomitantly.

Perphenazine products should be used with caution in patients with psychic depression.

Perphenazine may impair the mental and/or physical abilities required for the performance of hazardous tasks such as driving a car or operating machinery; therefore, the patient should be warned accordingly.

Perphenazine products are not recommended for pediatric patients under 12 years of age.

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome: a concealed diagnosis with multitreatment approach [^1112SgKt]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

While neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is typically characterised by delirium, motor rigidity, fever and dysautonomia, the syndrome is not pathognomonic, and NMS remains a diagnosis of exclusion. Here, we describe the case of a 44-year-old woman, with no relevant psychiatric history, admitted to a nephrology unit due to acute renal failure. After administration of antipsychotics, she presented with mental status alteration, generalised tremor, rigidity and autonomic nervous system dysfunction. Fever and rhabdomyolysis, however, were not prominent, and NMS was not considered initially in the differential diagnosis. The resulting delay in diagnosis, with continued administration of antipsychotics, led to progressive clinical deterioration. Once NMS was considered, however, antipsychotics were withdrawn and the patient was treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), followed by administration of a dopamine receptor agonist, with close to full remission of all symptoms. Importantly, during outpatient follow-up, sustained mild and asymmetric tremor and rigidity was noted, leading to a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. While this raises questions regarding differential diagnosis between NMS in Parkinson's disease, versus worsening of Parkinson's disease due to antipsychotic treatment, the former is supported by the acute and rapidly progressive onset of exuberant autonomic dysfunction and clouded conscience, after administration of a neuroleptic. Ultimately, a definitive distinction between these two alternatives for diagnosis of the inaugural neurological presentation in this patient is not possible. Nevertheless, we believe this case illustrates that NMS can be easily missed, particularly in atypical cases, delaying appropriate treatment, and that a flexible multimodal treatment approach, involving ECT, should be considered for complex clinical cases. Furthermore, it also underlines the importance of post-NMS follow-up, to investigate underlying neurological or medical disorders, particularly in those patients who do not have a full recovery.

### Metoclopramide [^116FWdK8]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

5.3 Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome

Metoclopramide may cause a potentially fatal symptom complex called neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). NMS has been reported in association with metoclopramide overdosage and concomitant treatment with another drug associated with NMS. Avoid metoclopramide in patients receiving other drugs associated with NMS, including typical and atypical antipsychotics.

Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and manifestations of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac arrhythmias). Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure. Patients with such symptoms should be evaluated immediately.

In the diagnostic evaluation, consider the presence of other serious medical conditions (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms. Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, malignant hyperthermia, drug fever, serotonin syndrome, and primary central nervous system pathology.

Management of NMS includes:

Immediate discontinuation of metoclopramide and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].
Intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring.
Treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available.

5.4 Depression

Depression has occurred in metoclopramide-treated patients with and without a history of depression. Symptoms have included suicidal ideation and suicide. Avoid metoclopramide use in patients with a history of depression.

5.5 Hypertension

Metoclopramide may elevate blood pressure. In one study in hypertensive patients, intravenously administered metoclopramide was shown to release catecholamines; hence, avoid use in patients with hypertension or in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors [see Drug Interactions (7.1)].

There are also clinical reports of hypertensive crises in patients with undiagnosed pheochromocytoma. Metoclopramide is contraindicated in patients with pheochromocytoma or other catecholamine-releasing paragangliomas [see Contraindications (4)]. Discontinue metoclopramide in any patient with a rapid rise in blood pressure.

5.6 Fluid Retention

Because metoclopramide produces a transient increase in plasma aldosterone, patients with cirrhosis or congestive heart failure may be at risk of developing fluid retention and volume overload. Discontinue metoclopramide if any of these adverse reactions occur.

Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis, and cardiac dysrhythmia). Additional signs may include elevated creatinine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.

The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated.

### Amoxapine [^114X2uRJ]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Given these considerations, neuroleptics should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic neuroleptic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that, 1) is known to respond to neuroleptic drugs, and, 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.

If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on neuroleptics, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment despite the presence of the syndrome.

### Evaluation and management of children with acute mental health or behavioral problems. part II: recognition of clinically challenging mental health related conditions presenting with medical or uncertain symptoms [^112LoccA]. Pediatrics (2016). Medium credibility.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) — clinical findings and treatment include that an elevated creatine kinase, often greater than 16 000 IU/L, and a low serum iron concentration may occur; management involves primarily supportive care and removal of the initiating agent, and if NMS is triggered by the abrupt withdrawal of an anti-Parkinsonism drug, reintroduction of the drug may be considered. Dehydration or elevated creatine kinase and rhabdomyolysis may be treated with intravenous (IV) fluids, and if renal failure occurs, hemodialysis may be necessary. For agitation, experts suggest benzodiazepines as the first-line agent, and fever can be treated with external cooling measures, such as cooling blankets. Pharmacologic options reported include dantrolene — commonly used dosages in NMS are 1 mg/kg by IV push followed by 0.25 to 0.75 mg/kg every 6 hours, and the drug may be continued until symptoms resolve or a maximum of 10 mg/kg is reached; bromocriptine — experts suggest an initial dosage of 1.25 to 2.5 mg twice a day, which may be increased to 10 mg 3 times a day; and amantadine — a common starting dosage is 100 mg orally, with a maximum dosage of 200 mg twice a day. Suggestions for NMS treatment are based on case reports and clinical experience, not rigorous clinical trials, limiting the strength of the evidence base.

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome during a change from haloperidol to risperidone [^114xRHeT]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) in a patient whose therapy was being switched from haloperidol to risperidone.

Case Report

A 57-year-old African-American man, treated for schizophrenia with haloperidol for several years, developed NMS within 48 hours of the addition of low doses of risperidone and mirtazapine to his regimen. Symptoms, which included fever, generalized rigidity, and altered mental status, resolved after discontinuation of psychotropics, supportive management, and several weeks of treatment with bromocriptine and dantrolene. He was subsequently treated with olanzapine without adverse effects.

Discussion

Several cases of NMS have been reported with risperidone, but none under these circumstances. NMS most likely occurred in this patient as a result of the additive dopamine 2 receptor blocking of haloperidol and risperidone. Sympathetic hyperactivity secondary to mirtazapine may also have been a contributing factor. If NMS may be induced by the simultaneous use of older, high-potency antipsychotics and newer, atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone, switching patients from older to newer antipsychotics may at times be difficult, since completely stopping one antipsychotic before starting the second may place patients at risk for psychotic relapse.

Conclusions

Clinicians should closely monitor patients receiving both haloperidol and risperidone or combinations of similar medications.

Anecdotal evidence tends to suggest clozapine treatment as a cause of leucocytosis in schizophrenic patients, however, no conclusive evidence is available on this topic. We report the clinical cases of two schizophrenic men who were diagnosed with clozapine-related leucocytosis. The clozapine treatment was performed at a dose between 200 and 400 mg/day. When leucocytosis appeared, there was a loss of response to clozapine in both patients. Clozapine-induced leucocytosis in schizophrenic patients could be correlated to occurrence of psychotic symptomatology.

Materials and methods

For facility of data recall, databases such as PubMed were searched to obtain a list of more than 600 publications from the years 1968 to 2006. Inclusion criteria for our study were the mention of therapy, treatment, dantrolene, case report, review of literature, and NMS since 1980 in title or abstract. Exclusion criteria were the exclusive mention of risk factors, pathophysiology, incidences and biochemistry, differential diagnosis, or foreign-language articles except those in German or English.

Altogether, 271 case reports including information on age, gender, diagnosis, and some data on therapy could be extracted. To avoid biases by multiply recorded case reports, case series were excluded as well. Information was registered as follows: year of publication, gender, age, diagnosis, triggering medications for NMS, dosages, time of incidence of NMS, fever, diaphoresis, pulse, rigidity, 'others' (blood pressure, level of consciousness, urinary retention, and so on), CPK, leukocytosis, other laboratory parameters (electrolytes, result of a lumbar puncture, and so on), time of withdrawal of the offending agent, dantrolene therapy (including dosage), adjuvant treatments such as cooling or others, course of illness, and time until complete recovery or death.

Because the main focus of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of dantrolene and other treatments of NMS, cases were divided according to their received therapy into four treatment groups (Figure 1). The severity of NMS was assessed according to the Levenson criteria. Thereby, it was possible to establish a comparable baseline status of patients within the aforementioned treatment groups.

Dantrolene mono: dantrolene monotherapy; dantrolene +: dantrolene with additive medication (including bromocriptine, amantadine, and electroconvulsive therapy treatment); other medication: any medical therapy (excluding dantrolene); only supportive: cooling, infusion, and restoring electrolyte balance (no medication).

Afterward, six categories pertaining to efficacy of treatment of NMS were assessed as follows: effectiveness of therapy within 24 hours, mortality, complete time of remission in days, effectiveness due to increase of dosage, relapse on the basis of decrease of dosage, and improvement of symptoms.

1 Increased Mortality in Elderly Patients with Dementia-Related Psychosis Elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. Analysis of 17 placebo-controlled trials, largely in patients taking atypical antipsychotic drugs, revealed a risk of death in drug-treated patients of between 1. 6 to

1. 7 times the risk of death in placebo-treated patients. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4. 5%, compared to a rate of about
2. 6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular or infectious in nature. There was considerable variation in risk of suicidality among drugs, but a tendency toward an increase in the younger patients for almost all drugs studied.

There were differences in absolute risk of suicidality across the different indications, with the highest incidence in MDD. The risk differences, however, were relatively stable within age strata and across indications. These risk differences are provided in Table 2. The following symptoms, anxiety, agitation, panic attacks, insomnia, irritability, hostility, aggressiveness, impulsivity, akathisia, hypomania, and mania, have been reported in adult and pediatric patients being treated with antidepressants for major depressive disorder as well as for other indications, both psychiatric and nonpsychiatric. Although a causal link between the emergence of such symptoms and either the worsening of depression and/or the emergence of suicidal impulses has not been established, there is concern that such symptoms may represent precursors to emerging suicidality.

Possible risk factors for leukopenia/neutropenia include pre-existing low white blood cell count (WBC) and history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia. Patients with a pre-existing low WBC or a history of drug-induced leukopenia/neutropenia should have their complete blood count (CBC) monitored frequently during the first few months of therapy and lurasidone hydrochloride should be discontinued at the first sign of decline in WBC, in the absence of other causative factors.

Patients with neutropenia should be carefully monitored for fever or other symptoms or signs of infection and treated promptly if such symptoms or signs occur. Patients with severe neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count < 1000/mm³) should discontinue lurasidone hydrochloride and have their WBC followed until recovery.

5.9 Orthostatic Hypotension and Syncope

Lurasidone hydrochloride may cause orthostatic hypotension and syncope, perhaps due to its α1-adrenergic receptor antagonism. Associated adverse reactions can include dizziness, lightheadedness, tachycardia, and bradycardia. Generally, these risks are greatest at the beginning of treatment and during dose escalation. Patients at increased risk of these adverse reactions or at increased risk of developing complications from hypotension include those with dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with antihypertensive medication, history of cardiovascular disease (e.g., heart failure, myocardial infarction, ischemia, or conduction abnormalities), history of cerebrovascular disease, as well as patients who are antipsychotic-naïve. In such patients, consider using a lower starting dose and slower titration, and monitor orthostatic vital signs.

Orthostatic hypotension, as assessed by vital sign measurement, was defined by the following vital sign changes: ≥ 20 mm Hg decrease in systolic blood pressure and ≥ 10 bpm increase in pulse from sitting to standing or supine to standing position.

Schizophrenia

Adults:

The incidence of orthostatic hypotension and syncope reported as adverse events from short-term, placebo-controlled schizophrenia studies was (lurasidone hydrochloride incidence, placebo incidence): orthostatic hypotension [0.3% (5/1508), 0.1% (1/708)] and syncope [0.1% (2/1508), 0% (0/708)].

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome versus serotonin syndrome: the search for a diagnostic tool [^114kXooF]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the use of urine dopamine and catecholamine concentrations as diagnostic aids in a patient with neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) in the emergency department setting.

Case Summary

A 61-year-old female on multiple medications, including several antipsychotics, rapidly deteriorated, with fever, lead-pipe rigidity, and decreased level of consciousness. The patient died 20 days after initial presentation to an emergency department. The Naranjo probability scale indicated probable causality for NMS due to quetiapine, haloperidol, and risperidone in this patient, whereas the Naranjo scale assigned only possible causality for serotonin syndrome developing with serotonergic agents. Laboratory investigations of blood and urine revealed elevations in dopamine, metanephrines, and epinephrines, as well as trazodone and risperidone. Serotonin metabolites were not elevated.

Discussion

NMS is a rare and potentially severe adverse effect associated with the use of antipsychotic medications. It is mainly characterized by hyperthermia, altered mental state, hemodynamic dysregulation, elevated serum creatine kinase, and rigors. It has been associated with multisystem organ failure potentially leading to rhabdomyolysis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The prevalence of this syndrome is associated with the use of neuroleptics. Serotonin syndrome is another adverse drug reaction leading to NMS associated with elevated serotonin. It occurs when multiple serotonergic medications are ingested and is associated with rapid onset of altered mental status, myoclonus, and autonomic instability. Differentiating between NMS and serotonin syndrome can be challenging because of their similar clinical presentation. This case highlights the importance of a diagnostic aid being available to help distinguish between the 2 syndromes.

Conclusions

We propose that laboratory findings that include dopamine and serotonin metabolites can be used as adjuncts to clinical and prescription histories in the diagnosis of NMS. The use of urinary catecholamine as a diagnostic aid in NMS needs further evaluation.

Given these considerations, neuroleptics should be prescribed in a manner that is most likely to minimize the occurrence of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic neuroleptic treatment should generally be reserved for patients who suffer from a chronic illness that, 1) is known to respond to neuroleptic drugs, and, 2) for whom alternative, equally effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, the smallest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. The need for continued treatment should be reassessed periodically.

If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on neuroleptics, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment despite the presence of the syndrome.

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome associated with haloperidol use in critical care setting: should haloperidol still be considered the drug of choice for the management of delirium in the critical care setting? [^112UZD64]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

A 48-year-old man was brought to the emergency department because of intoxication. The patient was in respiratory distress, subsequently intubated for airway protection. On hospital day 5, he was diagnosed with delirium. Haloperidol was initiated at 5 mg intravenous every 6 h and titrated up to a dose of 60 mg /day over 5 days. On hospital day 18, his temperature peaked to 107.1°F. Other symptoms included mental status change, muscular rigidity and autonomic dysfunction. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) associated with haloperidol was suspected. No other causes for these symptoms were present. Concurrent medications were reviewed and ruled out for possible drug-induced fever. Haloperidol was discontinued and dantrolene and bromocriptine was initiated. The temperature decreased to 102.2°F within 3 h and other symptoms resolved overtime. The temporal relationship between the patient's fever decline with the discontinuation of haloperidol, and improvement with dantrolene and bromocriptine, the diagnosis was believed to be haloperidol-induced NMS.

Treatment-resistant schizophrenia — augmentation of clozapine with another second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) is addressed as follows: "The evidence suggests augmenting clozapine with another second-generation antipsychotic medication", and it is "categorized as Reviewed, New-added". The Work Group's "confidence in the quality of the evidence was very low", and "for clozapine-resistant, treatment-resistant schizophrenia, the benefits of augmenting treatment with clozapine by adding a second-generation antipsychotic slightly outweighed the potential harms of adverse events or worsened symptoms". Cautions include that "discontinuation and consideration of other avenues of treatment, such as a different antipsychotic medication or procedural treatments (e.g., electroconvulsive therapy [ECT]), might be prudent", and that "caution and careful consideration of patient goals and side effect profiles should be considered". Burden and acceptability are noted: "The use of clozapine alone can be burdensome because of the Clozapine REMS requirement of blood draws for monitoring the risk arising from the presence of dangerous neutropenia and cardiomyopathy", and "for some individuals, adding an SGA to augment clozapine for residual symptoms of clozapine-resistant schizophrenia might not represent an increased burden", whereas "for some patients, acceptability implications might be a factor when adding an SGA to clozapine because of the increased burden of side effects". "Patient values and preferences varied because some individuals might express concern over treatment with additional medications". Recommendation: "We suggest augmenting clozapine with another second-generation antipsychotic medication for individuals with treatment-resistant schizophrenia who have not experienced an adequate response to clozapine".

### Low awareness of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis in a mixed-method survey of 354 patients and carers [^117M6TV7]. Schizophrenia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders are chronic, severe mental health conditions, estimated to affect 0.7–4% of the global population. For approximately one-third of individuals experiencing an acute episode of psychosis, conventional antipsychotic treatments fail to provide adequate symptom reduction, a condition known as treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). Clinical guidelines recommend clozapine in these cases, as it is regarded as more effective than other antipsychotic medications. Clozapine-induced agranulocytosis (CIA) is a decrease in absolute neutrophil count (ANC) persistently below 0.5 × 10⁹/L, increasing susceptibility to potentially life-threatening infections. The standard preventative protocols for CIA in most countries include ongoing haematological monitoring and a heightened awareness of any newly emerging physical alterations or symptoms that may suggest an infection, including fever, sore throat, or other flu-like manifestations.

Epidemiological research has consistently shown that CIA occurs predominantly within the first few months of treatment, with recent data estimating an incidence of 0.9% that drops significantly after two years –. This reduced risk is further supported by observational studies suggesting it is safe to reduce blood monitoring to every three months once the initial high-risk period has passed. The analysis of likely cases of CIA indicates a rapid decline in neutrophils over a week, casting doubt on the utility of ongoing mandatory fortnightly or monthly monitoring. Furthermore, recent observational data suggests that 70% of CIA cases transition from a 'normal count' (ANC > 2.0 × 10⁹/L) immediately to agranulocytosis (< 0.5 × 10⁹/L) predominantly within the early stages of treatment. While monitoring systems are undoubtedly effective, this body of evidence highlights their limitations and supports calls for a revision of haematological monitoring requirements after the early treatment phase to enhance patient access to clozapine.

If monitoring requirements were to be revised, patient education on identifying and responding to CIA (by seeking medical care when suspected) is plausibly the most essential safeguards against potential complications associated with CIA. Despite current concerns, there have been no attempts to explore patient and family/carers understanding around clozapine's association with agranulocytosis, its identification and action it warrants when suspected. Understanding this may assist care providers and policymakers to provide optimal support and resources for patients and key others in their networks. Therefore, our aim was to explore how informed people with lived experience of clozapine treatment, their family and carers, are about the potential signs and symptoms of CIA and what actions they should take.

### An atypical case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome precipitated by valproate [^113ZgqUM]. BMJ Case Reports (2014). Medium credibility.

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) can be caused by various drugs. We report a case of a 60-year-old woman who presented with high-grade fever, muscular rigidity, tachycardia, tachypnoea and altered sensorium along with seizures. She had been taking olanzapine for the past 2 years for psychosis. For the last month valproate was added to her treatment. Her blood investigations revealed hyponatraemia and raised serum ammonia and creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels. In view of hyperthermia, muscular rigidity, autonomic disturbances, altered mental status and raised CPK, a diagnosis of NMS was made. Valproate could have probably precipitated NMS; although the patient was taking antipsychotics for a long time, it was only with the addition of valproate that she developed these symptoms. Raised serum ammonia levels also indicated the presence of valproate toxicity. Seizures were probably due to electrolyte disturbances. Offending drugs were withdrawn. The patient improved with treatment by dopamine agonist and other supportive treatments.

- **Tardive dyskinesia**: Consider discontinuing risperidone if clinically indicated.
- **Metabolic Changes**: Atypical antipsychotic drugs have been associated with metabolic changes that may increase cardiovascular/ cerebrovascular risk. These metabolic changes include hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia and weight gain.
- **Weight Gain**: Significant weight gain has been reported. Monitor weight gain.
- **Hyperprolactinemia**: Prolactin elevations occur and persist during chronic administration.
- **Orthostatic hypotension**: For patients at risk, consider a lower starting dose and slower titration.
- **Leukopenia, Neutropenia and Agranulocytosis**: Perform complete blood counts in patients with a history of clinically significant low white blood cell count. Consider discontinuing risperidone if a clinically significant decline in WBC occurs in the absence of other causative factors.
- **Potential for cognitive and motor impairment**: Use caution when operating machinery.
- **Seizures**: Use cautiously in patients with a history of seizures or with conditions that lower the seizure threshold. ADVERSE REACTIONS The most common adverse reactions in clinical trials were parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, tremor, sedation, dizziness, anxiety, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting, upper abdominal pain, stomach discomfort, dyspepsia, diarrhea, salivary hypersecretion, constipation, dry mouth, increased appetite, increased weight, fatigue, rash, nasal congestion, upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis and pharyngolaryngeal pain.

14 Body Temperature Regulation. Over the course of a typical 10-week controlled trial, the rate of death in drug-treated patients was about 4. 5%, compared to a rate of about
2. 6% in the placebo group. Although the causes of death were varied, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular or infectious in nature. Observational studies suggest that, similar to atypical antipsychotic drugs, treatment with conventional antipsychotic drugs may increase mortality. The extent to which the findings of increased mortality in observational studies may be attributed to the antipsychotic drug as opposed to some characteristic of the patients is not clear.

In two of four placebo-controlled trials in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis, a higher incidence of mortality was observed in patients treated with furosemide plus risperidone when compared to patients treated with risperidone alone or with placebo plus furosemide. No pathological mechanism has been identified to explain this finding, and no consistent pattern for cause of death was observed. Risperidone is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psychosis. Cerebrovascular adverse reactions, including fatalities, were reported in patients in trials of risperidone in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. In placebo-controlled trials, there was a significantly higher incidence of cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with risperidone compared to patients treated with placebo.

The phenylephrine contained in promethazine HCl, phenylephrine HCl and codeine phosphate oral solution can produce cardiovascular and central nervous system effects in some patients such as, insomnia, dizziness, weakness, tremor, transient elevations in blood pressure, or arrhythmias. Central nervous system stimulation with convulsions or cardiovascular collapse with accompanying hypotension has also been reported. Phenylephrine can cause a decrease in cardiac output. In patients with hypertension or with peripheral vascular insufficiency, phenylephrine may cause ischemia, increasing the risk of gangrene or thrombosis of compromised vascular beds. Therefore, promethazine HCl, phenylephrine HCl and codeine phosphate oral solution is contraindicated in patients with severe hypertension, coronary artery disease, or peripheral vascular insufficiency [see Contraindications (4)], and should be used with caution in patients with other cardiovascular disorders, including patients with arteriosclerosis, elderly individuals, or patients with poor cerebral circulation.

5.14 Risk of Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome

A potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) has been reported in association with promethazine HCl alone or in combination with antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, altered mental status and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac dysrhythmias).

The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.

The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of promethazine HCl, antipsychotic drugs, if any, and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. There is no general agreement about specific pharmacological treatment regimens for uncomplicated NMS.

Since recurrences of NMS have been reported with phenothiazines, avoid use of promethazine HCl, phenylephrine HCl and codeine phosphate oral solution in patients with a history consistent with NMS.

### An international guideline with six personalised titration schedules for preventing myocarditis and pneumonia associated with clozapine [^1115a9RY]. General Psychiatry (2022). Medium credibility.

White blood cell (WBC) monitoring has reduced clozapine-treated patient deaths associated with agranulocytosis to a rarity. However, clozapine protocols and package inserts worldwide provide no instructions for preventing myocarditis or pneumonia during clozapine titrations. Prescribers worldwide are largely unaware of that. Meanwhile, as they worry about agranulocytosis, their clozapine-treated patients are at risk of dying from pneumonia or myocarditis. Consequently, an international guideline with 104 authors from 50 countries/regions was recently published to provide personalised clozapine titration schedules for adult inpatients. This forum article reviews pneumonia and myocarditis occurring during clozapine titration, as well as the three most innovative aspects of this new guideline: (1) personalised titration, (2) C reactive protein (CRP) measures, and (3) dose predictions based on blood levels. Clozapine metabolism is influenced by 3 levels of complexity: (1) ancestry groups, (2) sex-smoking subgroups, and (3) presence/absence of poor metabolizer status. These 3 groups of variables should determine the maintenance dose and speed of clozapine titration; they are summarised in a table in the full-text. The international clozapine titration guideline recommends measuring CRP levels simultaneously with WBC, at baseline and weekly at least for the first 4 weeks of titration, the highest risk period for clozapine-induced myocarditis.

### Contemporary perspectives in critical care of neuroleptic malignant syndrome [^114HmMgd]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a psychiatric-neurologic emergency that may require intensive care management. There is a paucity of information about NMS as a critical illness. We reviewed the Mayo Clinic experience.

Methods

A comprehensive data extraction was completed within the Mayo Clinic system diagnosed with NMS using International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision (ICD-9); ICD-9, Clinical Modification; ICD-10; ICD-10, Clinical Modification; and Health Insurance Claim (HIC) codes between the years of 1995 and 2023. Major criteria included fever, rigidity, tachycardia, and exposure to a neuroleptic agent. Minor criteria included rhabdomyolysis and dysautonomia. Criteria for exclusion were Parkinson's disease, abrupt discontinuation of baclofen or levodopa, concomitant selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors use or serotonin syndrome, malignant catatonia, or a classic dystonic reaction.

Results

A total of 332 patients had diagnostic codes of NMS, but only 20 patients fulfilled DSM-5 (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision), diagnostic criteria. The average age was 48.2 years (range 20–93 years). Four patients received antipsychotics following postoperative acute agitation or delirium (20%). Previous psychiatric diagnoses were schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder in six patients (33%), major depressive disorder in five patients (20%), and bipolar disorder in two patients (10%). Haloperidol was the sole inciting neuroleptic in five patients (25%), but the remainder was associated with atypical or second-generation antipsychotics. A total of nine patients (45%) required mechanical ventilation. The majority of patients had rhabdomyolysis, which led to acute kidney failure in nearly half of them, but none required hemodialysis. Most patients recovered promptly, and no fatalities were directly attributable to NMS; however, four patients (20%) died within 1 month, and four patients died years from diagnosis and unrelated to NMS.

Conclusions

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome can become a critical illness, but there is often rapid recovery. Mortality proximate to NMS was uncommon, but late mortality remained substantial. The overwhelming majority of cases coded as NMS did not meet DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. Stricter criteria should be applied when diagnosing NMS in critical care and emergency medicine settings.

### Clinical presentation… [^114suUp7]. AAFP (2022). Medium credibility.

FIRST- AND SECOND-GENERATION ANTIPSYCHOTICS First-generation antipsychotics are dopamine receptor antagonists. Second-generation antipsychotics are serotonin receptor antagonists, which have less impact on dopamine metabolism. There is no evidence-based algorithm or ranking guidance in selecting a first- or second-generation antipsychotic because of the heterogeneity of clinical trials and limited number of head-to-head comparisons. 20 Second-generation antipsychotics are generally preferred as first-line agents for acute treatment and maintenance therapy because of their reduced risk of extrapyramidal symptoms compared with first-generation antipsychotics. 34 However, second-generation antipsychotics still carry a significant risk of extrapyramidal symptoms. Both generations of antipsychotics can produce extrapyramidal symptoms of pseudoparkinsonism, akathisia, and dystonia.

First-generation antipsychotics, which are comprised of typical antipsychotics phenothiazines, thioxanthenes, and butyrophenones, are more likely than second-generation antipsychotics to contribute to developing these conditions. Antihistamines, nonselective beta blockers, or benzodiazepines are used to treat symptoms. 20 Tardive dyskinesia, characterized by repetitive, jerking movements that occur in the face, neck, and tongue, is another adverse effect of first- and second-generation antipsychotics. It is more common in older female patients with diabetes mellitus. 35 Moderate to severe tardive dyskinesia should be treated with reversible vesicular monoamine transporter 2 inhibitors, deutetrabenazine and valbenazine. 36 The most common adverse effect is somnolence. Patients should be monitored for QT-prolongation.

Vitamin E, vitamin B 6, and amantadine may reduce symptoms of tardive dyskinesia.
37. Second-generation antipsychotics, also known as atypical antipsychotics, are associated with the development of metabolic syndrome, which includes weight gain, hyperglycemia with the potential of developing insulin resistance, and lipid abnormalities. 38, 39 A meta-analysis found a significant reduction in body mass index and insulin resistance, but not fasting blood glucose levels, in patients taking a second-generation antipsychotic with metformin compared with taking the antipsychotic with placebo. 40 Another meta-analysis determined that metformin compared with placebo achieved clinically relevant weight loss of 7% of body weight. TREATMENT-RESISTANT SCHIZOPHRENIA Treatment-resistant schizophrenia is the persistence of significant symptoms despite adequate pharmacologic treatment.

26 To determine severity of symptoms and response to treatment, physicians can use validated scoring scales. 26, 43 Higher scores are indicative of treatment-resistant schizophrenia and should encourage a goal-oriented discussion of escalation of therapy and evaluation of psychosocial interventions.

### Combination of strategies to initiate clozapine for refractory schizophrenia in a patient with low neutrophil levels [^115raNU7]. BMJ Case Reports (2022). High credibility.

Outcome and follow-up

As a result of these strategies, the neutrophil count increased to 5.5 × 10⁹/L on day 65, and clozapine administration was continued. The clozapine dose was subsequently increased to 450 mg by day 114. The patient was discharged on day 129. The BPRS score on discharge was 46 points (moderate). Following discharge, no neutropenia was observed, and the patient continued clozapine treatment for > 2 years.

### Lack of cardinal symptoms of meningitis in a hospitalized patient with chronic schizophrenia: lessons to be learned [^115pR9Bj]. General Hospital Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

There are prior reports describing a diagnostic delay in medical emergencies in patients with schizophrenia. To our knowledge, this is the first case report demonstrating the risk of diagnostic delay of acute meningitis due to reduced pain perception as well as other factors related to schizophrenia and its treatment.

Method

We report a case of meningitis in a patient suffering from chronic schizophrenia and poor treatment response despite high doses of antipsychotics. Potential difficulties and pitfalls when suspecting or diagnosing meningitis as a physical comorbidity in patients with schizophrenia are discussed.

Results

A 33-year-old man with chronic and treatment-resistant schizophrenia developed acute meningitis. The definite diagnosis was delayed because the cardinal symptoms other than fever were not clearly elicited by physical examination. The characteristic symptoms of meningitis were concealed by reduced pain perception, rigidity due to the administration of antipsychotics, disorganized thinking and potentially diminished communication with health care professionals as commonly seen in patients with schizophrenia.

Conclusion

Meningitis should not be dismissed as a possibility in patients with fever of unknown origin just because a patient with schizophrenia does not present with cardinal features of meningitis other than fever.

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome

There have been rare reports of an uncommon but potentially fatal symptom complex sometimes referred to as Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) associated with metoclopramide. Clinical manifestations of NMS include hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, altered consciousness, and evidence of autonomic instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, diaphoresis and cardiac arrhythmias).

The diagnostic evaluation of patients with this syndrome is complicated. In arriving at a diagnosis, it is important to identify cases where the clinical presentation includes both serious medical illness (e.g., pneumonia, systemic infection, etc.) and untreated or inadequately treated extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS) Other important considerations in the differential diagnosis include central anticholinergic toxicity, heat stroke, malignant hyperthermia, drug fever and primary central nervous system (CNS) pathology.

The management of NMS should include 1) immediate discontinuation of metoclopramide and other drugs not essential to concurrent therapy, 2) intensive symptomatic treatment and medical monitoring, and 3) treatment of any concomitant serious medical problems for which specific treatments are available. Bromocriptine and dantrolene sodium have been used in treatment of NMS, but their effectiveness have not been established (see ADVERSE REACTIONS).

### Coexistence of serotonin syndrome and neuroleptic malignant syndrome: does it exist? [^111nuNNi]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

We report a 21-year-old man with bipolar disorder who was on a stable dose of escitalopram and risperidone. Tramadol and cough syrup (dextromethorphan) were added for his recent attack of upper respiratory tract infection. However, he developed various neurological symptoms. Haloperidol and ondansetron were added after hospitalisation. However, his condition deteriorated. A diagnosis of serotonin syndrome (SS) was made, and cyproheptadine was started. Cyproheptadine provided relief in most of the symptoms within 48 hours except for the presence of fever and rigidity. The addition of bromocriptine provided a complete resolution of the symptoms. We considered the presence of both SS and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) in this case. There are four similar cases in the literature. We discussed a diagnostic and therapeutic approach for patients who are on both serotonergic agents and neuroleptics and develop SS-like or NMS-like clinical features.

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome secondary to quetiapine [^111EqZx5]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2009). Low credibility.

Objective

To report a case of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) secondary to quetiapine in which the patient developed extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).

Case Summary

A 34-year-old male with a history of severe brain damage, mental retardation, and seizures was admitted to the hospital with changes in mental status, development of tremors, and a temperature of 39.9 degrees C. Initial differential diagnoses included seizure, aspiration, stroke, and infection. Once these were excluded, NMS was considered. The patient exhibited other characteristics of NMS during hospitalization, including lead pipe rigidity, tachycardia, and high creatine kinase level (up to 12,654 IU/L). Drug therapy on presentation included quetiapine 200 mg 3 times per day, guanfacine 2 mg/day, carbamazepine 400 mg every 12 hours, valproic acid 500 mg twice daily, and lorazepam 2 mg (unknown schedule). He reportedly had received these medications for at least a month before admission. On hospital day 2, quetiapine was discontinued. The patient received traditional treatment for NMS, which included bromocriptine, dantrolene, intravenous fluids, and supportive care. The NMS resolved in 7 days.

Discussion

In cases of NMS, clinicians previously believed that the risk for developing severe adverse effects such as EPS was lower with atypical versus typical antipsychotics. We identified 13 cases of NMS secondary to quetiapine in the literature via a search of MEDLINE/PubMed (1950–2008), and Iowa Drug Information Service (1966–2008). Seventy-five percent of previous reports of NMS secondary to quetiapine had reactions that included EPS. Common patient characteristics in our report and others included male sex, history of mental retardation, and treatment modalities used in NMS. Unique characteristics in this case included length of therapy without dosage change or titration and no known history of drug-related EPS. The Naranjo probability scale indicated a probable relationship between the development of NMS and quetiapine.

Conclusions

NMS with associated EPS has been previously associated with quetiapine. Clinicians should be aware that NMS with EPS can occur with quetiapine at steady state doses without recent dosage adjustments or titration.

### Assessment and management of patients at risk for suicide: synopsis of the 2024 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guidelines [^112LjaoK]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Clozapine for schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder with suicidality — we suggest clozapine to reduce the risk of suicide attempts for patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and either suicidal ideation or a history of suicide attempt(s). This is a Reviewed, Amended recommendation, and the Work Group's confidence in the quality of the evidence was low with limitations including a small sample size; the benefits slightly outweighed potential harms such as weight gain, lipid abnormalities, sialorrhea, somnolence, and the rarely occurring but serious adverse events of myocarditis and cardiomyopathy. Monitoring and infrastructure burdens are emphasized: the Clozapine Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) mandates frequent visits to monitor laboratory results before refills, requires capacities to meet FDA regulatory requirements including laboratory tests to monitor neutrophil levels, training for pharmacies and prescribers, registration of pharmacies, prescribers, and patients, and reporting of episodes of neutropenia. Patients may be unwilling to commit to repeated weekly blood draws over six months, and clozapine is often used as the antipsychotic of last resort due to risks such as agranulocytosis.

### Neuroleptic malignant syndrome following reintroduction of an antipsychotic after overdose [^1138F7Uo]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Medium credibility.

The pathogenesis of NMS can be considered a complex cascade of dysregulation of multiple neurochemical and neuroendocrine systems, culminating in an end-stage hypermetabolic syndrome. A central dopaminergic blockade theory has been proposed to explain NMS involving striatal and hypothalamic dopamine receptors. There is also evidence to suggest that dysregulation of the sympathetic nervous system may account for, at least some of, the features of NMS. Finally, more recently a neuroimmunological explanation of NMS has been proposed, implicating the role of proinflammatory cytokines. In our case report, the elevation of fibrinogen (an acute phase protein) is consistent with this later hypothesis, with the patient's dehydration potentially acting as an inflammatory stimulus.

This case report highlights the importance of recognising that patients may develop NMS several years after starting antipsychotic therapy. Furthermore, NMS may occur any time, but particularly in the presence of additional risk factors, such as dehydration. ARF in the presence NMS is associated with a mortality risk of approximately 50%, therefore, it is vital that clinicians are vigilant for evidence of dehydration in patients treated with antipsychotics.

Patient's perspective

The ECT allowed me to resume activities that I had not been doing for several years as dancing, seeing friends, playing cards and improved substantially my quality of life.

Learning points

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) is a serious and potentially lethal adverse drug reaction.
NMS is unpredictable but is related to the administration of dopamine antagonists.
NMS can be best described as a complex cascade of multiple dysregulated neurochemical and neuroendocrine systems, potentially culminating in an end-stage hypermetabolic syndrome.
Risk factors for NMS, such as dehydration as well as renal and hepatic impairment, should be considered prior to, and during treatment with antipsychotics.

### Managing an effective treatment for neuroleptic malignant syndrome [^113Fks6F]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Discussion

In regard to the efficacy of the dantrolene treatment, in our analysis the complete time of remission was prolonged by a combination with dantrolene treatment, and the mortality of a monotherapy was higher. Furthermore, the time of remission was not significantly shorter in a dantrolene monotherapy than in other therapy regimens including only supportive therapy. This has not been observed before; other studies. did not examine the efficacy of dantrolene therapy in regard to monotherapy and therapy with additive medications. In our study, the additive treatment had the highest OR for an elongated complete regression time whereas the monotherapy showed the lowest OR. Considering the severity of the NMS at baseline, patients receiving dantrolene monotherapy were more severely ill than patients with other medications, which might explain the high mortality among the group of patients receiving dantrolene monotherapy.

A possible limitation of the present study is that it is based on case reports and some case reports were fragmentary in respect to the information necessary for our purposes. From the age of patients to dosage specifications, there was a wide range of missing information. Furthermore, none of the analyzed case studies addressed a suitable scale for the assessment of rigidity. Also, the temporal sequence of symptoms of NMS was not described by the latitude of studies.

The short time effectiveness within 24 hours was as effective in the dantrolene monotherapy group as in the group receiving different medication and was as ineffective in the dantrolene treatment group with additive medication as in the group of patients receiving supportive therapy alone. Nevertheless, in respect to the effectiveness due to increasing dosages, the relapse based on the decrease in dosage, or the improvement of symptoms such as fever and muscle rigidity, no obvious differences could be detected in our analysis.

Case presentation

History of present illness

A 52-year-old man presented to the emergency department with shortness of breath. He was altered, febrile, tachypneic and hypoxic. Lung auscultation revealed bibasilar crackles and cardiac examination was normal. Laboratory tests were significant for an elevated C-reactive protein (276 mg/L), elevated D-dimer (3.45 μg/mL) and normal troponin I (< 0.015 ng/mL). In the emergency room, he underwent endotracheal intubation due to acute hypoxic respiratory failure and altered mental status, and admitted to the intensive care unit. On the evening of hospital day 2, he became haemodynamically unstable and noted to have ST segment elevations on the telemonitor.

Medical history

The patient is a nursing home resident with history of schizophrenia, diabetes mellitus and hypertension. He was recently diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 by reverse transcription PCR of a nasopharyngeal swab at his nursing home.

Clozapine for treatment-resistant schizophrenia spectrum disorders in youth — a clinical standard: A trial of clozapine should be considered for youth with treatment resistant schizophrenia spectrum disorders [CS]. Before using clozapine, it is important to review the child's clinical status and treatment history to ensure that the presentation accurately reflects treatment refractory schizophrenia, and for complicated cases or the apparent diagnosis of schizophrenia in a younger child (e.g., < 12 years), a diagnostic second opinion may be warranted. When using clozapine, systematic monitoring of side effects, including following established protocols for blood count monitoring, is required; white blood cell and absolute neutrophil counts are obtained at baseline and weekly for the first 6 months to monitor the risk for agranulocytosis, and protocols require a coordinated effort among the pharmacy, laboratory, and physician to ensure that the blood count parameters are being monitored concurrently with prescriptions.

### Zuclopenthixol-induced neuroleptic malignant syndrome in an adolescent girl [^111zDiLX]. Clinical Toxicology (2007). Low credibility.

We present the case of a 14-year-old female who had many characteristics of neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) without pyrexia following a single depot injection of 200 mg of zuclopenthixol. The patient presented with a change in mental status that had progressed over the preceding 48 hours. Subsequently, she became increasingly agitated and confused, and developed diffuse muscular rigidity, mutism, tremor, tachycardia, diaphoresis, sialorrhea, and incontinence. Results of laboratory tests showed elevated CPK levels, leukocytosis, and a low serum iron level. Bromocriptine and diazepam were used as initial treatment of a probable NMS and provided significant improvement. During the next seven days, she clinically improved but continued to exhibit emotional lability, logorrhea, elevated mood, and increased psychomotor activity. Therefore, bromocriptine and diazepam were discontinued and lorazepam and lithium were administered as treatment of a bipolar disorder. Four weeks later, she was discharged in stable condition. The presentation of this case report suggests that the primary psychiatric diagnosis is important in antipsychotic usage in the pediatric population, and that young patients receiving neuroleptic treatment should be monitored for the early signs of NMS. Using the diagnostic criteria of a neuroleptic toxicity spectrum may result in greater clinical awareness and earlier recognition of NMS.

Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS), a potentially fatal symptom complex, has been reported in association with administration of antipsychotic drugs. Clinical manifestations of NMS are hyperpyrexia, muscle rigidity, delirium, and autonomic instability. Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosphokinase, myoglobinuria (rhabdomyolysis), and acute renal failure.

If NMS is suspected, immediately discontinue VRAYLAR and provide intensive symptomatic treatment and monitoring.

5.000000000000000e+00 5 Tardive Dyskinesia

Tardive dyskinesia, a syndrome consisting of potentially irreversible, involuntary, dyskinetic movements, may develop in patients treated with antipsychotic drugs, including VRAYLAR. The risk appears to be highest among the elderly, especially elderly women, but it is not possible to predict which patients are likely to develop the syndrome. Whether antipsychotic drug products differ in their potential to cause tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

The risk of tardive dyskinesia and the likelihood that it will become irreversible increase with the duration of treatment and the cumulative dose. The syndrome can develop after a relatively brief treatment period, even at low doses. It may also occur after discontinuation of treatment.

Tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, if antipsychotic treatment is discontinued. Antipsychotic treatment itself, however, may suppress (or partially suppress) the signs and symptoms of the syndrome, possibly masking the underlying process. The effect that symptomatic suppression has upon the long-term course of tardive dyskinesia is unknown.

Given these considerations, VRAYLAR should be prescribed in a manner most likely to reduce the risk of tardive dyskinesia. Chronic antipsychotic treatment should generally be reserved for patients: 1) who suffer from a chronic illness that is known to respond to antipsychotic drugs; and 2) for whom alternative, effective, but potentially less harmful treatments are not available or appropriate. In patients who do require chronic treatment, use the lowest dose and the shortest duration of treatment producing a satisfactory clinical response should be sought. Periodically reassess the need for continued treatment.

If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appear in a patient on VRAYLAR, drug discontinuation should be considered. However, some patients may require treatment with VRAYLAR despite the presence of the syndrome.

### White blood cell monitoring during long-term clozapine treatment [^113sENXr]. The American Journal of Psychiatry (2013). Low credibility.

Late-onset agranulocytosis is rare during treatment with clozapine, especially in monotherapy. The authors describe a case of agranulocytosis that emerged after 19 years of continuous clozapine monotherapy. The discovery of the agranulocytosis was due to the lifelong white blood cell counts that are now required for clozapine treatment. Despite the fact that this requirement probably saved the life of this patient, this monitoring is not evidence-based because the incidence of agranulocytosis does not exceed that of conventional antipsychotic drugs, for which no such requirement exists. For mentally competent and adequately informed patients, the Netherlands Clozapine Collaboration Group now permits quarterly monitoring after the first 6 months of clozapine treatment.

### Evidence-based consensus guidelines for the management of catatonia: recommendations from the British Association for Psychopharmacology [^1174x1wG]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2023). Medium credibility.

Among patients who recover from NMS, there may be a 30% risk of recurrent episodes following antipsychotic rechallenge. However, most patients who require antipsychotics can be safely treated provided measures to reduce risk are followed. Strategies suggested are minimising other risk factors for NMS (such as agitation, medical illness and dehydration), allowing at least 2 weeks from recovery before rechallenge, using a low dose of a SGA with gradual titration and careful monitoring for early signs of NMS.

Recommendations for the treatment of NMS

In NMS, discontinue all dopamine antagonists. (C)
In NMS, discontinue anticholinergic drugs. (S)
In NMS, supportive care should be provided. This consists of assessment and appropriate management of airway, ventilation, temperature and swallow. Fluid input/output should be monitored, and aggressive fluid resuscitation should be used where required. There should be assessment for hyperkalaemia, renal failure and rhabdomyolysis. There should be careful monitoring for complications such as cardiorespiratory failure, aspiration pneumonia, thromboembolism and renal failure, alongside early consideration of high-dependency care. (S)
For mild, early NMS, characterised by mild rigidity, catatonia or confusion, temperature < 38°C and HR < 100, consider a trial of lorazepam. (C)
For moderate NMS, characterised by moderate rigidity, catatonia or confusion, temperature = 38°C–40°C and HR = 100–120, consider a trial of lorazepam. Consider a trial of bromocriptine or amantadine. Consider ECT. (C)
For severe NMS, characterised by severe rigidity, catatonia or coma, temperature > 40°C and HR > 120, consider a trial of lorazepam and consider dantrolene. Consider bromocriptine or amantadine. Consider ECT. (C).
If clinical features persist, consider bilateral ECT three times weekly or, in severe cases, once or twice daily, until NMS abates. Continue ECT three times per week until there is sustained improvement to a total of 5–20 treatments. (C)
Delay restarting antipsychotics by at least 2 weeks after resolution of an NMS episode to reduce the risk of recurrence. (C)

### Elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios correlate with increased clozapine concentration-to-dose ratios during titration [^114WqWnN]. Schizophrenia (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Clozapine is a highly effective atypical antipsychotic used for the management of treatment-resistant schizophrenia; however, it is underused because of its various side effects. The ability to metabolize clozapine varies significantly among individuals. Factors such as sex, smoking, and ethnicity are known to affect clozapine metabolism, and international guidelines recommend initial titration protocols that consider these factors. Rapid clozapine titration that is not appropriate for an individual's metabolic capacity can lead to early inflammatory side effects such as fever, myocarditis, and pneumonia –. This may progress to a life-threatening condition characterized by organ damage such as myocarditis, pneumonia, nephritis, liver dysfunction, and pancreatitis, which may be accompanied by eosinophilia and rash, and is diagnosed as clozapine-associated drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome –. These conditions are thought to be caused by an immune hypersensitivity reaction to clozapine. The relative mortality rate of myocarditis and pneumonia associated with clozapine is significantly higher than that of clozapine-associated agranulocytosis. Therefore, it is important to estimate the clozapine-metabolizing ability of an individual early in the titration phase and perform individualized titration. Measuring the clozapine concentration-to-dose (C/D) ratio helps estimate the individual metabolic capacity. Our previous study analyzing the weekly measurements of clozapine blood concentrations within 6 weeks of starting clozapine revealed that fever increased the clozapine C/D ratio. Inflammation reportedly reduces the activity of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, the main enzyme involved in the metabolism of clozapine. The underlying mechanism is hypothesized to be that inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α suppress the transcription of CYP1A2, thereby reducing its synthesis and activity. The inflammation induced by clozapine itself may impair its metabolism, leading to increased clozapine blood levels and further inflammation, creating a vicious cycle. Therefore, international guidelines recommend measuring C-reactive protein (CRP) weekly for the first 4 weeks after initiating clozapine and avoiding dose increases if CRP levels rise. Our previous study measured CRP levels weekly or daily during clozapine titration and reported that CRP levels were elevated in many patients even in the absence of obvious inflammatory symptoms such as fever. Furthermore, we showed that the C/D ratio may temporarily increase even in patients without fever. Based on these results, we hypothesized that subclinical inflammation during clozapine titration increases the clozapine C/D ratio. Most of the data on the relationship between inflammation and elevated blood clozapine levels is based on case reports, and studies with well-controlled cohorts are lacking. A recent retrospective study by Smith et al. identified 126 patients who had their clozapine blood levels and CRP levels measured simultaneously, demonstrating an association between CRP and clozapine blood levels. However, they were limited as the clinical context of each patient and the timing of the blood measurements (number of days after starting clozapine) were unknown, and the longitudinal change in the C/D ratio within patients was unknown. Therefore, we decided to examine the relationship between inflammation and clozapine blood levels using past datasets. Although CRP was not measured simultaneously with clozapine blood levels, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts were routinely measured in clinical practice. We therefore decided to use the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) as a marker of inflammation.

Malignant catatonia

Catatonia may be conceptualised as a continuum, with milder forms at one end (termed simple or benign) and more severe forms, involving hyperthermia and autonomic dysfunction (termed malignant), at the other.described 'lethal catatonia' as a fulminant psychotic disorder characterised by intense motor excitement, which progressed to stuporous exhaustion, cardiovascular collapse, coma and death. The entire course, passing through excitement into stupor, involved mounting hyperthermia, autonomic instability, delirium, muscle rigidity and prominent catatonic features. The paucity of findings on autopsy was difficult to explain and in sharp contrast to the catastrophic clinical manifestations. This disorder was the subject of numerous publications throughout the pre-antipsychotic drug era. Competing terminology included Bell's mania, acute delirious mania, pernicious catatonia and delirium acutum, among numerous others. More recently, the term malignant catatonia has been proposed, since not all cases are fatal. Unlike Stauder, some authors have observed that muscle tone in malignant catatonia is flaccid.

Although the incidence of malignant catatonia appears to have declined following the introduction of modern psychopharmacologic agents, it continues to be reported. Like non-malignant catatonia, malignant catatonia represents a syndrome rather than a specific disease, occurring in association with diverse neuromedical illnesses as well as with psychiatric disorders. Current data suggest that it is likely that a proportion of malignant catatonia cases previously attributed to schizophrenia were more likely the product of autoimmune disorders, particularly anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Mortality, which had exceeded 75% during the pre-antipsychotic drug era, has fallen to 10% in recent reports.

Although some qualified support may exist for the use of SGAs in non-malignant catatonia (see section 'Dopamine receptor antagonists and partial agonists'), the literature on antipsychotics for malignant catatonia is rather different. First, there is an issue that malignant catatonia is generally clinically indistinguishable from NMS, so antipsychotics seem injudicious. Second, in a review of 292 malignant catatonia cases, 78% of those treated with only an antipsychotic died, compared with an overall mortality of 60%. Moreover, this review found that many patients with catatonia developed malignant features only after treatment with antipsychotics. The evidence for the SGAs in malignant catatonia is minimal and mixed. Antipsychotic drugs should be withheld whenever malignant catatonia is suspected.
