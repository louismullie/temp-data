## Question

Can ursodiol be used to treat acute diverticulitis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether ursodiol can be used to treat acute diverticulitis. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about ursodiol's FDA-labeled indications and pharmacology. Then, I should review guideline-based management of acute diverticulitis to see what therapies are endorsed. Next, I will check for any clinical or mechanistic evidence linking ursodiol to diverticulitis outcomes. After that, I need to analyze the pathophysiologic fit or mismatch. Finally, I will consider common misconceptions and synthesize an evidence-based conclusion and care recommendation, anchoring each step to established sources [^113w5yL1] [^111j4YAs] [^117Sp1JW].

> Let me first confirm the labeled uses and mechanism of ursodiol, because if there is no regulatory or mechanistic rationale, that already sets strong priors against its role here. Ursodiol's therapeutic actions are in the liver, bile, and gut lumen via enterohepatic circulation; it reduces cholesterol saturation of bile and is indicated for radiolucent gallstone dissolution and prevention of gallstones during rapid weight loss, with no labeled or described role in colonic inflammatory conditions such as diverticulitis [^113w5yL1] [^115BkwmM].

> Wait, let me verify what guideline-based management of acute diverticulitis actually recommends, so I don't overstate anything. Contemporary guidelines emphasize selective rather than routine antibiotics for immunocompetent patients with mild uncomplicated disease, clear criteria for imaging, outpatient management for many, and specific triggers for antibiotics and procedural or surgical escalation; none list ursodiol as a treatment option for diverticulitis in any phase of care [^111j4YAs] [^117Sp1JW] [^116VYm5s].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — absence from guidelines does not always mean lack of evidence, so I should check for trials or mechanistic studies linking ursodiol to diverticulitis outcomes. I need to check high-level reviews and consensus statements; across comprehensive reviews and society updates summarizing medical and surgical management of diverticulitis, there are no clinical trials, case series, or mechanistic proposals supporting ursodiol for diverticulitis treatment or prevention, and it is not discussed as a candidate therapy [^111wPfNc] [^113NWVLs] [^111TYn2T].

> Let me consider the pathophysiology to ensure there isn't a plausible mechanistic niche I'm overlooking. Diverticulitis typically follows microperforation of diverticula with localized inflammation and bacterial translocation involving gram-negative and anaerobic organisms; management targets inflammation, infection control when indicated, and complications such as abscess, whereas ursodiol's bile-acid–modulating effects in the hepatobiliary tract offer no direct antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory action in the colonic wall that would alter this course [^113NWVLs] [^113w5yL1].

> But wait, what if the confusion stems from other agents studied in diverticular disease; I should double-check that. Mesalamine has been studied but is not recommended for recurrence prevention; rifaximin and probiotics have been explored primarily for symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease with heterogeneous, low-quality evidence and no clear role in preventing acute diverticulitis, which further underscores that even agents with gastrointestinal anti-inflammatory or microbiome effects have limited or no proven benefit here, let alone ursodiol [^1166BgQz] [^116zJ56o] [^112tbaLB].

> Hmm, wait a minute, could there be any narrow scenario — such as biliary-colonic cross-talk — where ursodiol's effects might be indirectly beneficial? Given the lack of data, absence from guidelines, and the mechanistic mismatch, I should confirm that evidence-based care should continue to rely on selective antibiotics for defined indications, supportive care, risk-stratified imaging and follow-up, and procedural or surgical management for complications, rather than introducing ursodiol off label [^111j4YAs] [^117Sp1JW] [^116VYm5s].

> I should confirm the clinical bottom line. Based on labeled indications, the guideline landscape, the absence of supportive studies, and a lack of pathophysiologic rationale, ursodiol is not indicated and should not be used to treat acute diverticulitis; care should align with contemporary guideline recommendations on when to use antibiotics, how to monitor, and when to pursue intervention, with no role for ursodiol in this pathway [^113w5yL1] [^111j4YAs] [^111wPfNc].

---

Ursodiol is **not indicated for acute diverticulitis** and should not be used for its management [^111wPfNc]. No evidence supports **ursodiol for diverticulitis**, and it is not included in any guideline for this condition [^111TYn2T] [^117Sp1JW]. Standard care is supportive management, with selective antibiotics reserved for complicated or high-risk cases [^111j4YAs] [^111FL5kK], and ursodiol should be avoided given its lack of efficacy and potential adverse effects [^113w5yL1].

## Pharmacological properties and clinical indications of ursodiol

Ursodiol is a hydrophilic bile acid that reduces cholesterol saturation in bile, stabilizes hepatocyte membranes, and exerts anti-inflammatory effects in cholestatic liver disease [^113w5yL1]. It is **FDA-approved** for:

- **Gallstone dissolution**: Radiolucent, non-calcified cholesterol gallstones in patients who are poor surgical candidates or refuse surgery [^115BkwmM].

- **Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC)**: To improve liver biochemistry and slow disease progression.

- **Prevention of gallstones**: In patients undergoing rapid weight loss [^115BkwmM].

Ursodiol is **not approved or recommended** for acute diverticulitis [^111wPfNc].

---

## Pathophysiology of acute diverticulitis

Acute diverticulitis is **inflammation of colonic diverticula**, typically due to microperforation, bacterial translocation, and localized infection [^113NWVLs]. Management focuses on controlling inflammation, preventing complications, and reducing recurrence [^115XUUdp].

---

## Current clinical guidelines for acute diverticulitis management

Major society guidelines (AGA, ASCRS, ACP, WSES) **recommend** [^111oYCq8]:

- **Uncomplicated diverticulitis**: Supportive care (clear liquids, analgesia) [^115kUeHR]; selective antibiotics reserved for immunocompromised, severe symptoms [^111TYn2T], or high inflammatory markers [^111j4YAs] [^111PGekX] [^111FL5kK].

- **Complicated diverticulitis**: Antibiotics [^111TYn2T], possible percutaneous drainage [^116VYm5s], and surgical consultation [^115XUUdp] [^111j4YAs].

- **No role for ursodiol**: Ursodiol is not mentioned or recommended in any guideline for acute diverticulitis [^111wPfNc] [^113NWVLs].

---

## Evidence regarding ursodiol in acute diverticulitis

There is **no clinical evidence** (RCTs, observational studies, or case reports) supporting the use of ursodiol for acute diverticulitis [^111wPfNc]. Its pharmacological actions do not address bacterial infection or colonic inflammation, which are central to diverticulitis [^113NWVLs].

---

## Potential risks and adverse effects of ursodiol

Ursodiol is generally well tolerated, but **adverse effects** include [^113w5yL1]:

- **Gastrointestinal symptoms**: Diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, dyspepsia [^115BkwmM].

- **Hepatic effects**: Rare elevations in liver enzymes [^113w5yL1].

- **Allergic reactions**: Rare hypersensitivity [^117Nn3fY].

These risks are **unjustified** given the absence of benefit in diverticulitis [^111j4YAs].

---

## Comparison with standard treatments

Standard treatments (supportive care, selective antibiotics, surgery when indicated) are evidence-based and guideline-supported [^113NWVLs]. Ursodiol lacks evidence and is **not recommended**, so it is inferior to standard care [^111wPfNc].

---

## Clinical scenarios where ursodiol might be considered

There are **no clinical scenarios** in which ursodiol is appropriate for acute diverticulitis. Its use should be limited to approved indications (gallstone dissolution, PBC, prevention of gallstones in rapid weight loss) [^115BkwmM].

---

## Ongoing research or clinical trials

There are **no ongoing trials** or studies evaluating ursodiol for acute diverticulitis.

---

Ursodiol is **not indicated for acute diverticulitis** and lacks supporting evidence or guideline endorsement [^111TYn2T]. Management should follow established guidelines; ursodiol should be avoided in this context [^111FL5kK].

### AGA clinical practice update on medical management of colonic diverticulitis: Expert review [^111PGekX]. Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Colonic diverticulitis is a painful gastrointestinal disease that recurs unpredictably and can lead to chronic gastrointestinal symptoms. Gastroenterologists commonly care for patients with this disease. The purpose of this clinical practice update is to provide practical and evidence-based advice for the management of diverticulitis. We reviewed systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and observational studies to develop 14 best practices.

In brief, computed tomography is often necessary to make a diagnosis. Rarely, a colon malignancy is misdiagnosed as diverticulitis. Whether patients should have a colonoscopy after an episode of diverticulitis depends on the patient's history, most recent colonoscopy, and the disease severity and course. In patients with a history of diverticulitis and chronic symptoms, alternative diagnoses should be excluded with both imaging and lower endoscopy.

Antibiotic treatment can be used selectively rather than routinely in immunocompetent patients with mild acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Antibiotic treatment is strongly advised in immunocompromised patients. To reduce the risk of recurrence, patients should consume a high-quality diet, have a normal body mass index, be physically active, not smoke, and avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use except aspirin prescribed for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. At the same time, patients should understand that genetic factors also contribute to diverticulitis risk. Patients should be educated that the risk of complicated diverticulitis is highest with the first episode.

### 2013 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^114AzAtg]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis should be treated with antibiotic therapy to address gram-negative and anaerobic pathogens (Recommendation 2C). The routine use of antibiotics for patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is a point of controversy in the medical community. In 2011, a systematic review was published overviewing antibiotic use in cases of uncomplicated diverticulitis, noting that relevant data concerning mild or uncomplicated cases were sparse and of poor methodological quality. There was no concrete evidence to support the routine use of antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated diverticulitis.

Recently, a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial involving 10 surgical departments in Sweden and 1 in Iceland investigated the use of antibiotic treatment in cases of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis. Results indicated that antibiotic treatment did not accelerate recovery or prevent complications or recurrence in these cases. However, even in the absence of evidence supporting the routine use of antibiotics for patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis, we recommend adequate antimicrobial coverage for gram-negative and anaerobic microorganisms.

Mild cases of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis should be treated in an outpatient setting. This treatment depends on the condition and compliance of the patient as well as their availability for follow-up analysis. The regimen involves orally administered antibiotics to combat gram-negative and anaerobic pathogens.

Despite the long-time prevalence of diverticulitis as one of the most common gastrointestinal diseases in both the inpatient and outpatient settings, its etiology, prevention, and treatment remain hotly contested. Once viewed as a disorder primarily affecting older people in Western populations, diverticulitis has rapidly increased its presence in all age groups worldwide, prompting researchers to reexamine the pathophysiology of the disease process. Clinicians continue to push the envelope with novel approaches to management, from avoiding antibiotics for uncomplicated cases to identifying subsets of patients with complicated diverticulitis who may not require an operation. Here, we review the most recent literature on a wide array of topics in diverticulitis, with an emphasis on publications within the last five years.

### Randomized clinical trial of observational versus antibiotic treatment for a first episode of CT-proven uncomplicated acute diverticulitis [^112Ayosi]. The British Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Antibiotics are advised in most guidelines on acute diverticulitis, despite a lack of evidence to support their routine use. This trial compared the effectiveness of a strategy with or without antibiotics for a first episode of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis.

- **Methods**: Patients with CT-proven, primary, left-sided, uncomplicated, acute diverticulitis were included at 22 clinical sites in the Netherlands and assigned randomly to an observational or antibiotic treatment strategy. The primary endpoint was time to recovery during 6 months of follow-up. Main secondary endpoints were readmission rate, complicated diverticulitis, ongoing diverticulitis, re-diverticulitis, sigmoid resection, and mortality. Intention-to-treat and per-protocol analyses were performed.

- **Results**: A total of 528 patients were included. Median time to recovery was 14 days (interquartile range 6–35) for the observational strategy and 12 days (7–30) for the antibiotic treatment strategy, with a hazard ratio for recovery of 0.91 (lower limit of one-sided 95 percent confidence interval [CI] 0.78; P = 0.151). No significant differences between the observation and antibiotic treatment groups were found for secondary endpoints: complicated diverticulitis (3.8 percent versus 2.6 percent respectively; P = 0.377), ongoing diverticulitis (7.3 percent versus 4.1 percent; P = 0.183), re-diverticulitis (3.4 percent versus 3.0 percent; P = 0.494), sigmoid resection (3.8 percent versus 2.3 percent; P = 0.323), readmission (17.6 percent versus 12.0 percent; P = 0.148), adverse events (48.5 percent versus 54.5 percent; P = 0.221), and mortality (1.1 percent versus 0.4 percent; P = 0.432). Hospital stay was significant…

### Recent advances in the treatment of colonic diverticular disease and prevention of acute diverticulitis [^112MyQaU]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Data on the role of fiber in the primary prevention of diverticulitis are particularly conflicting. Patients with a history of diverticulosis or diverticular disease (DD) commonly seek dietary and lifestyle recommendations to reduce their risk of occurrence or recurrence of the disease and any complications. The traditional recommendation has been to consume a high-fiber diet. Using data from a single case-control study that included 56 participants, it is estimated that a high-fiber diet might reduce the number of complications by 52 cases per 1000 patients treated and the need for surgery by 100 cases per 1000 patients treated. Based on a prospective cohort study that examined the association of dietary fiber intake and the risk of incident hospitalization for DD, it is estimated that a high-fiber diet may reduce the risk of acute diverticulitis by 59 cases per 1000 patients. We rated the quality of this evidence as very low, due to substantial differences between our target population (those with a history of diverticulitis) and those in the cohort study (those without a history of diverticulitis).

Only three randomized trials have analyzed the role of fiber in preventing diverticulitis occurrence in these patients. Unfortunately, their sample sizes were too small to demonstrate a significant effect of high-fiber supplementation on the prevention of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis or other complications of DD, such as abscess, perforation, stenosis, fistula, or bleeding.

### Meta-analyses of current strategies to treat uncomplicated diverticulitis [^112NPuGT]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). Low credibility.

Uncomplicated colonic diverticulitis is common. There is no consensus regarding the most appropriate management. Some authors have reported the efficacy and safety of observational management, while others have argued for a more aggressive approach with oral or intravenous antibiotic treatment.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to perform an updated meta-analysis of the different management strategies for uncomplicated diverticulitis with two separate meta-analyses.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases were used.

- **Study selection**: All randomized clinical trials, as well as prospective and retrospective comparative studies, were included.

- **Interventions**: Observational management and antibiotic treatments, including both oral and intravenous, were considered.

- **Main outcome measures**: Successful management (emergency management, recurrence, elective management) was measured.

- **Results**: After reviewing 293 identified records, 11 studies met the inclusion criteria. Seven studies compared observational management and antibiotic treatment (2,321 patients), and four studies compared oral and intravenous antibiotic treatment (355 patients). There was no significant difference between observational management and antibiotic treatment in terms of emergency surgery (0.7% vs. 1.4%; p = 0.1) and recurrence (11% vs. 12%; p = 0.3). In this part, considering only randomized trials, elective surgery during the follow-up occurred more frequently in the observational group than in the antibiotic group (2.5% vs. 0.9%; p = 0.04). The second meta-analysis showed that failure and recurrence rates…

### AGA clinical practice update on medical management of colonic diverticulitis: Expert review [^115ypMkE]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding surgical interventions for acute diverticulitis, particularly elective colectomy, the AGA 2021 guidelines recommend offering an individualized discussion on elective segmental resection for patients with a history of diverticulitis. This discussion should take into account disease severity, patient preferences and values, and the risks and benefits, including quality of life (QoL). Patients should be counseled that surgery reduces but does not eliminate the risk of diverticulitis, and chronic gastrointestinal symptoms may not always improve with surgery.

### International, expert-based, consensus statement regarding the management of acute diverticulitis [^115egEyg]. JAMA Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

This Delphi study provides consensus related to many aspects of acute diverticulitis and identifies other areas in need of research. The objective was to generate an international, expert-based consensus statement to address controversies in the management of acute diverticulitis.

The study was conducted using the Delphi technique from April 3 through October 21, 2014. A survey website was used, and a panel of acute diverticulitis experts was formed via the snowball method. The top 5 acute diverticulitis experts in 5 international geographic regions were identified based on their number of publications related to acute diverticulitis.

The Delphi study used 3 rounds of questions, after which the consensus statement was collated. Twenty items were selected for inclusion in the consensus statement following the 3 questioning rounds.

A clear definition of uncomplicated and complicated diverticulitis is provided. In uncomplicated diverticulitis, consensus was reached regarding appropriate laboratory and radiological evaluation of patients, as well as nonsurgical, surgical, and follow-up strategies. However, some important topics, such as antibiotic treatment, failed to reach consensus. Additionally, consensus was achieved regarding many nonsurgical and surgical treatment strategies in cases of complicated diverticulitis.

Controversy continues internationally regarding the management of acute diverticulitis.

### Diagnosis and management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis: A clinical guideline from the American College of Physicians [^117Sp1JW]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

The American College of Physicians (ACP) developed this guideline to provide clinical recommendations on the diagnosis and management of acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis in adults. This guideline is based on the best available evidence about benefits and harms, considered in the context of costs and patient values and preferences.

- **Methods**: The ACP Clinical Guidelines Committee (CGC) developed this guideline based on a systematic review on the use of computed tomography (CT) for diagnosing acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis and on management via hospitalization, antibiotic use, and interventional percutaneous abscess drainage. The systematic review evaluated outcomes that the CGC rated as critical or important. This guideline was developed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) methodology.

- **Target audience and patient population**: The target audience is all clinicians, and the target patient population is adults with suspected or known acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis.

- **Recommendation 1**: ACP suggests that clinicians use abdominal CT imaging when there is diagnostic uncertainty in a patient with suspected acute left-sided colonic diverticulitis (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

- **Recommendation 2**: ACP suggests that clinicians manage most patients with acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis in an outpatient setting (conditional recommendation; low-certainty evidence).

- **Recommendation 3**: ACP suggests that clinicians initially manage select patients with acute uncomplicated left-sided colonic diverticulitis…

### Contemporary review of risk-stratified management in acute uncomplicated and complicated diverticulitis [^114DzQgr]. World Journal of Surgery (2016). Low credibility.

Acute colonic diverticulitis is a common clinical condition. The severity of the disease is determined through clinical, laboratory, and radiological investigations, which dictate the need for medical or surgical intervention. Recent clinical trials have improved the understanding of the natural history of the disease, resulting in new approaches and better evidence for the management of acute diverticulitis.

- **Methods**: We searched the Cochrane Library (2004–2015), MEDLINE (2004–2015), and EMBASE (2004–2015) databases. The search terms used were "diverticulitis, colonic", "acute diverticulitis", or "divertic" in combination with "management", "antibiotics", "non-operative", or "surgery". Registers for clinical trials (such as the WHO registry and https://clinicaltrials.gov/) were also searched for ongoing, recruiting, or closed trials not yet published.

- **Results**: Antibiotic treatment can be avoided in simple, non-complicated diverticulitis, and outpatient management is safe. The management of complicated disease, ranging from a localized abscess to perforation with diffuse peritonitis, has shifted towards either percutaneous or minimally invasive approaches in selected cases. The role of laparoscopic lavage without resection in perforated non-fecal diverticulitis is still debated; however, recent evidence from two randomized controlled trials has indicated a higher re-intervention rate in this group of patients.

- **Conclusions**: There has been a shift towards conservative management in acute uncomplicated disease. Those with uncomplicated acute diver…

### Randomized clinical trial of antibiotics in acute uncomplicated diverticulitis [^115GJJpx]. The British Journal of Surgery (2012). Low credibility.

The standard of care for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis is antibiotic treatment, although there are no controlled studies supporting this management. The aim was to investigate the need for antibiotic treatment in acute uncomplicated diverticulitis, with the endpoint of recovery without complications after 12 months of follow-up.

- **Methods**: This multicentre randomized trial involved ten surgical departments in Sweden and one in Iceland and recruited 623 patients with computed tomography-verified acute uncomplicated left-sided diverticulitis. Patients were randomized to treatment with (314 patients) or without (309 patients) antibiotics.

- **Results**: Age, sex, body mass index, co-morbidities, body temperature, white blood cell count, and C-reactive protein level on admission were similar in the two groups. Complications, such as perforation or abscess formation, were found in six patients (1.9 percent) who received no antibiotics and in three (1.0 percent) who were treated with antibiotics (P = 0.302). The median hospital stay was three days in both groups. Re-diverticulitis necessitating readmission to hospital at the 1-year follow-up was similar in the two groups (16 percent, P = 0.881).

- **Conclusion**: Antibiotic treatment for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis neither accelerates recovery nor prevents complications or recurrence. It should be reserved for the treatment of complicated diverticulitis.

### Sages white paper on antibiotic omission in the management of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis: why, when, who, and most importantly, how [^115MqEkG]. Surgical Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

Historically, the management of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis was centered on antibiotics. However, modern theories regarding the pathogenesis of diverticulitis have challenged the notion that antibiotics are necessary in all cases. Despite major reform in many societal guidelines, the adoption of non-antibiotic therapy for uncomplicated diverticulitis has been limited, especially in North America. The purpose of this SAGES White Paper was to review the available evidence on antibiotic omission in uncomplicated diverticulitis and to explore methods of safe implementation.

- **Methods**: A task force within the SAGES Colorectal Surgery Committee was formed to work on this White Paper. The committee and its leadership approved an outline that would focus on the following topics: (1) Defining the problem with unnecessary antibiotic exposure, (2) Evaluating the evidence on antibiotic omission in uncomplicated diverticulitis, (3) Identifying the appropriate patient for antibiotic omission, (4) Outlining how to counsel patients who are treated without antibiotics, (5) Reviewing methods to safely implement this practice in both the hospital and community setting. These topics were divided up among members of the task force who performed a structured literature search in preparation for their assignments.

- **Results**: Antibiotics are associated with several patient and societal adverse effects, including the rising problem of antimicrobial resistance. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated no superiority to the routine administration of antibiotics in acute uncomplicated diverticulitis.

### Unmet needs in treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease and prevention of recurrent acute diverticulitis: a scoping review [^112tbaLB]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

A more recent systematic review summarized the evidence deriving from studies that tested the effectiveness of mesalazine in preventing the recurrence of acute diverticulitis episodes. Authors identified six randomized trials comparing treatment with mesalazine in various doses and schedules of administration versus placebo for a total of 1,898 participants. The meta-analysis of the six RCTs found a summary OR of 1.15 (95% CI: 0.92–1.44) for diverticulitis recurrence with mesalazine. No dose–effect relationship was documented.

In the same systematic review, four RCTs reported time to relapse but with conflicting results. Parente et al. reported worse outcomes with mesalazine; patients treated with mesalazine 1.6 g/day (10 days per month) had a shorter mean time to relapse than patients treated with placebo [MD, −151 days (95% CI: −366 to −66 days)]. The other three studies found no statistically significant differences between mesalazine and placebo.

The role of mesalazine in the prevention of recurrence of diverticulitis was also investigated in a few non-randomized studies. The two observational studies previously discussed, comparing mesalazine versus rifaximin, produced conflicting results.

In another study on 218 patients, the combination of mesalazine and rifaximin (109 patients treated with rifaximin 400 mg bid plus mesalazine 800 mg bid for 7 days, followed by rifaximin 400 mg bid plus mesalazine 800 mg bid for 7 days/month) was shown to be more effective than rifaximin alone (109 patients treated with rifaximin 400 mg bid for 7 days, followed by rifaximin 400 mg bid).

### Outpatient treatment for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis [^113o6Ku8]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2013). Low credibility.

Traditionally, treatment of acute diverticulitis has mostly been based on inpatient care. The question arises whether these patients can be treated on an outpatient basis as admissions for diverticular disease have been shown to increase every year. We studied whether outpatient treatment of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis is feasible and safe, and which patients could benefit from outpatient care.

- **Materials and methods**: A retrospective cohort study was carried out in two teaching hospitals using hospital registry codes for diverticulitis. All patients diagnosed with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis between January 2004 and January 2012, confirmed by imaging or colonoscopy, were included. Exclusion criteria were patients with recurrent diverticulitis, complicated diverticulitis (Hinchey stages 2, 3, and 4), and right-sided diverticulitis. Inpatient care was compared with outpatient care. The primary outcome was admission for outpatient care and the complication rate in both groups. Multivariate analysis was carried out to identify potential factors for inpatient care.

- **Results**: Of 627 patients with diverticulitis, a total of 312 consecutive patients were identified with primary uncomplicated diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon. 194 patients had been treated as inpatients and 118 patients primarily as outpatients. In this last group, 91.5% had been treated successfully without diverticulitis-related complications or the need for hospital admission during a mean follow-up period of 48 months.

Conclusion: Despite inherent patient selection in a retrospective study design, the results suggest that outpatient treatment for acute uncomplicated diverticulitis is a feasible and safe option for selected patients.

### Ursodiol 400 mg [^113w5yL1]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

About 90% of a therapeutic dose of ursodiol is absorbed in the small bowel after oral administration. After absorption, ursodiol enters the portal vein and undergoes efficient extraction from portal blood by the liver, where it is conjugated with either glycine or taurine and is then secreted into the hepatic bile ducts. Ursodiol in bile is concentrated in the gallbladder and expelled into the duodenum in gallbladder bile via the cystic and common ducts by gallbladder contractions provoked by physiological responses to eating. Only small quantities of ursodiol appear in the systemic circulation, and very small amounts are excreted into urine. The sites of the drug's therapeutic actions are in the liver, bile, and gut lumen.

Beyond conjugation, ursodiol is not altered or catabolized appreciably by the liver or intestinal mucosa. A small proportion of the orally administered drug undergoes bacterial degradation with each cycle of enterohepatic circulation. Ursodiol can be both oxidized and reduced at the 7-carbon, yielding either 7-keto-lithocholic acid or lithocholic acid, respectively. Further, there is some bacterially catalyzed deconjugation of glyco- and tauro-ursodeoxycholic acid in the small bowel. Free ursodiol, 7-keto-lithocholic acid, and lithocholic acid are relatively insoluble in aqueous media, and larger proportions of these compounds are lost from the distal gut into the feces. Reabsorbed free ursodiol is reconjugated by the liver. Eighty percent of lithocholic acid formed in the small bowel is excreted.

### Emerging evidence and recent controversies in diverticulitis: a 5-year review [^114KMZrF]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Diverticulitis is a common gastrointestinal disease that still garners significant attention and study because of its heterogeneity in presentation and outcome. We provide a review of the newest and most controversial topics in diverticulitis. Recent discoveries on the influence of diet and other environmental risk factors are discussed, showing how the epidemiology of the disease process is shifting away from what was previously felt to be a disorder primarily limited to older Western populations. Interestingly, as has long been suspected, genetic mutations and variations associated with the development of diverticulitis are being discovered and are summarized here. The data for non-operative and outpatient management of diverticulitis are reviewed, as are pharmacologic agents studied for use in the secondary prevention of diverticulitis. Lastly, we present controversies in the surgical treatment of diverticulitis. This review will provide a synopsis of the last 5 years of literature relating to diverticulitis.

### Meta-analysis of the role of colonoscopy after an episode of left-sided acute diverticulitis [^113uymya]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

Several national and international guidelines on acute diverticulitis have been published in recent years. The recommendations in these guidelines are conflicting, and the evidence on which they are based differs. Most of the guidelines (6 of 8) recommend routine colonoscopy after an episode of acute diverticulitis to rule out malignancy. Although the American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) suggests that previous colonoscopies, co-morbidities, persistent symptoms, and patients' preferences may influence the decision.

- **Scientific grounds**: The AGA and German guidelines are based on a previous systematic review. In contrast, two other guidelines used only two observational studies. An Italian guideline published in 2015 stated that evidence-based data were not available. The American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons made strong recommendations based on studies with a low quality of evidence, primarily assessing the risk of malignancy in a selected group of patients with suggestive signs such as colonic wall thickening or mass on CT.

- **Opposing recommendations**: Two guidelines recommend not performing routine colonoscopy after an episode of acute diverticulitis. Of these, the World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) recommends omitting colonoscopy only in patients with uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. Notably, the AGA and WSES guidelines make opposite recommendations.

### Emergency medicine updates: Acute diverticulitis [^115XUUdp]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2024). High credibility.

Acute diverticulitis is a condition commonly seen in the emergency department (ED). Therefore, it is important for emergency medicine clinicians to be aware of the evidence regarding the diagnosis and management of this disease. This paper evaluates key evidence-based updates concerning acute diverticulitis for the emergency clinician.

Diverticulitis is a complication of diverticulosis and most commonly affects the sigmoid and descending colon in Western countries. History and examination can suggest the diagnosis, with abdominal pain and tenderness in the left lower quadrant being the most common symptom and sign, respectively. Changes in bowel habits and fever may also occur. Laboratory testing may demonstrate leukocytosis or an elevated C-reactive protein.

- **Imaging options**: These can include computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis with intravenous contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or ultrasound (US), though most classification systems for diverticulitis incorporate CT findings.

- **Complications and treatment**: While the majority of diverticulitis cases are uncomplicated, complications may affect up to 25% of patients. Treatment of complicated diverticulitis requires antibiotics and surgical consultation. Antibiotics are not required in select patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis. Appropriate patients for supportive care without antibiotics should be well-appearing, have pain adequately controlled, be able to tolerate oral intake, be able to follow up, have no complications, and have no immunocompromise or severe comorbidities.

### Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and treatment of diverticulitis [^113NWVLs]. Gastroenterology (2019). High credibility.

Diverticulitis is a prevalent gastrointestinal disorder associated with significant morbidity and healthcare costs. Approximately 20% of patients with incident diverticulitis experience at least one recurrence. Complications, such as abdominal sepsis, are less likely to occur with subsequent events. Several risk factors, many of which are modifiable, have been identified, including obesity, diet, and physical inactivity. Diet and lifestyle factors may affect the risk of diverticulitis through their effects on the intestinal microbiome and inflammation. Preliminary studies have found that the composition and function of the gut microbiome differ between individuals with and without diverticulitis. Genetic factors, as well as alterations in colonic neuromusculature, can also contribute to the development of diverticulitis.

Less aggressive and more nuanced treatment strategies have been developed:

- **Antibiotic usage**: Two multicenter, randomized trials of patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis found that antibiotics did not speed recovery or prevent subsequent complications.

- **Surgical intervention**: Elective surgical resection is no longer recommended solely based on the number of recurrences or young patient age and might not be necessary for some patients with diverticulitis complicated by abscess.

- **Urgent surgery**: Randomized trials of hemodynamically stable patients who require urgent surgery for acute, complicated diverticulitis that has not improved with antibiotics provide evidence to support primary anastomosis versus sigmoid colectomy with end colostomy.

Despite these advances, more research is needed to increase understanding and improve treatment outcomes for those with diverticulitis.

### Long-term implications of persistent diverticulitis: A retrospective cohort study of 915 patients [^115tZutu]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2021). Low credibility.

Persistent (or ongoing) diverticulitis is a well-recognized outcome after treatment for acute sigmoid diverticulitis; however, its definition, incidence, and risk factors, as well as its long-term implications, remain poorly described.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to assess the incidence, risk factors, and long-term outcomes of persistent diverticulitis.

- **Design**: This was a retrospective cohort study.

- **Settings**: Two university-affiliated hospitals in Montreal, Quebec, Canada were included.

- **Patients**: The study was composed of consecutive patients managed nonoperatively for acute sigmoid diverticulitis.

- **Intervention**: Nonoperative management of acute sigmoid diverticulitis was involved.

- **Main outcome measures**: Persistent diverticulitis, defined as inpatient or outpatient treatment for signs and symptoms of ongoing diverticulitis within the first 60 days after treatment of the index episode, was measured.

- **Results**: In total, 915 patients were discharged after an index episode of diverticulitis managed nonoperatively. Seventy-five patients (8.2%; 95% CI, 6.5%-10.2%) presented within 60 days with persistent diverticulitis. Factors associated with persistent diverticulitis were younger age (adjusted OR = 0.98 [95% CI, 0.96–0.99]), immunosuppression (adjusted OR = 2.02 [95% CI, 1.04–3.88]), and abscess (adjusted OR = 2.05 [95% CI, 1.03–3.92]). Among the 75 patients with persistent disease, 42 (56.0%) required hospital admission, 6 (8.0%) required percutaneous drainage, and 5 (6.7%) required resection. After a median follow-up of 39.0 months (range, 17.0–6

### Risk of recurrent disease and surgery following an admission for acute diverticulitis [^115gK8Bn]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2018). Low credibility.

Diverticular disease accounts for significant morbidity and mortality and may manifest as episodes of acute diverticulitis. However, the role of elective surgery is not clearly defined.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to define the rate of hospital admission for recurrent acute diverticulitis and identify risk factors associated with recurrence and surgery.

- **Design**: This is a retrospective population-based cohort study.

- **Settings**: National Health Service hospital admissions for acute diverticulitis in England between April 2006 and March 2011 were reviewed.

- **Patients**: Hospital Episode Statistics data identified adult patients with the first episode of acute diverticulitis (index admission), and then identified readmissions and elective or emergency surgery for acute diverticulitis during a minimum follow-up period of four years. Exclusion criteria included previous diagnoses of acute diverticulitis, colorectal cancer, or GI bleeding, and prior colectomy or surgery or death during the index admission.

- **Interventions**: There were no interventions.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcomes measured were readmissions for acute diverticulitis and patients requiring either elective or emergency surgery during the study period.

- **Results**: A total of 65,162 patients were identified with their first episode of acute diverticulitis. The rate of hospital admission for recurrent acute diverticulitis was 11.2%. A logistic regression model examined factors associated with recurrent acute diverticulitis and surgery: patient age, female sex, smoking, obesity, and comorbidity score.

### Recent advances in the treatment of colonic diverticular disease and prevention of acute diverticulitis [^1118rQkH]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Three double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have recently assessed the role of mesalazine in treating patients with this condition. The first trial investigated the efficacy and safety of mesalazine granules at 3 g/day versus placebo in patients experiencing lower abdominal pain as a symptom of SUDD. Change in lower abdominal pain at week 4 (with baseline defined using a pain score from the 7 days pre-treatment) was significantly lower in the mesalazine group (P = 0.05) in the per-protocol (PP) population, but not in the intention-to-treat population (P = 0.374). Post hoc adjustment for confounding factors resulted in P = 0.005 (PP), and safety was comparable between the groups.

The second trial assessed the effectiveness of mesalazine, with or without probiotics, versus placebo in maintaining remission in SUDD patients. Four groups were randomly enrolled: Group M (active mesalazine 1.6 g/day plus Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) subsp. DG placebo), Group L (active L. casei subsp. DG 24 billion/day plus mesalazine placebo), Group LM (active L. casei subsp. DG 24 billion/day plus active mesalazine), and Group P (L. casei subsp. DG placebo plus mesalazine placebo). SUDD recurred in none (0%) of the patients in Group LM, in 7 (13.7%) patients in Group M, in 8 (14.5%) patients in Group L, and in 23 (46.0%) patients in Group P (LM group vs. M group, P = 0.015; LM group vs. L group, P = 0.011; LM group vs. P group, P = 0.000; M group vs. P group, P = 0.0001; L group vs. P group, P = 0.0001). No adverse events were recorded during the study.

Another double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, not yet published, assessed the efficacy of mesalazine in controlling abdominal pain in SUDD patients.

- **Alternative therapies**: Watchful waiting has the advantage that no therapy may ever be required. For patients with silent or minimally symptomatic stones, the rate of development of moderate-to-severe symptoms or gallstone complications is estimated to be between 2% and 6% per year, leading to a cumulative rate of 7% to 27% in 5 years. Presumably, the rate is higher for patients already having symptoms.

- **Cholecystectomy**: For patients with symptomatic gallstones, surgery offers the advantage of immediate and permanent stone removal but carries a high risk in some patients. About 5% of cholecystectomized patients have residual symptoms or retained common duct stones. The spectrum of surgical risk varies as a function of age and the presence of disease other than cholelithiasis.

	- **Mortality rates for cholecystectomy in the US**: According to the National Halothane Study, which reviewed 27,600 cholecystectomies (smoothed rates), the mortality rates per 1000 operations were analyzed. Women in good health or who have only moderate systemic disease and are under 49 years of age have the lowest surgical mortality rate (0.054); men in all categories have a surgical mortality rate twice that of women. Common duct exploration quadruples the rates in all categories. The rates rise with each decade of life and increase tenfold or more in all categories with severe or extreme systemic disease.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for acute diverticulitis, specifically in relation to diagnostic imaging, the AGA 2021 guidelines recommend considering obtaining a CT scan to confirm the diagnosis of diverticulitis in patients without a prior imaging-confirmed diagnosis and to evaluate for potential complications in patients with severe presentations. Imaging should also be considered for patients who are failing to improve with therapy, those who are immunocompromised, or individuals experiencing multiple recurrences and contemplating prophylactic surgery, in order to confirm the diagnosis and location of the disease.

### Observational versus antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis: An individual-patient data meta-analysis [^115ibJpZ]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

- **Risk factors and role of antibiotics in prevention of adverse outcomes**: Although no statistically significant differences were found between treatment groups, some of the differences in adverse event rates may be considered clinically relevant if the statistical power appeared to be insufficient. Furthermore, even though antibiotic treatment may not be effective for the entire study group, some patients might possibly benefit from such treatment. Therefore, additional analyses were performed to assess the potential role of antibiotics in the prevention of these adverse outcomes.

	- Risk factors for the development of ongoing diverticulitis, complicated diverticulitis, and sigmoid resection were assessed. Additionally, to maximize power in the logistic regression analyses, risk factors for ongoing diverticulitis, complicated diverticulitis, or undergoing a sigmoid resection were evaluated as a single adverse outcome group. A primary episode of diverticulitis appeared to be protective against ongoing diverticulitis (OR 0.29, 97.5% CI 0.13 to 0.66). Risk factors for the development of complicated diverticulitis were a VAS pain score of more than 7 (OR 2.78, 1.18 to 6.54) and WBC higher than 13.5 × 10^9/L (OR 2.62, 1.11 to 6.18). A pain score of more than 7 was also a risk factor for sigmoid resection (OR 2.32, 1.05 to 5.10). Analyses of all three adverse outcomes as a single adverse event group yielded no additional findings.

Another systematic review and meta-analysis on the role of routine colonic evaluation after radiologically confirmed acute diverticulitis was published in 2014. Eleven studies from seven countries were included in the analysis. Among 1970 patients, cancer was only found in 22 (0.01%) cases. The risk of malignancy following a radiologically proven episode of acute uncomplicated diverticulitis was low. However, patients with complicated diverticulitis had a significant risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) at subsequent colonic evaluation.

A retrospective study of 633 patients with acute diverticulitis diagnosed by CT was published in 2014. Of the 663 patients, 97 underwent emergency resection, while 536 were treated non-operatively, 394 of whom subsequently underwent colonoscopy. The findings showed 17 cancers (2.7%) in patients with an initial diagnosis of acute diverticulitis. As shown by CT, 16 cancer patients (94%) had an abscess, while one patient had pericolic extraluminal gas but no abscess. Of the patients with an abscess, 11.4% had cancer mimicking acute diverticulitis. No cancer was found in the patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis.

### Acute diverticulitis: Key features for guiding clinical management [^111MoAL8]. European Journal of Radiology (2020). Low credibility.

Diverticular disease of the colon and small bowel is an important cause of pathology leading to emergency department visits and urgent gastrointestinal surgery. CT is a highly sensitive and specific modality for the diagnosis of acute diverticulitis and its complications, as well as for the exclusion of alternate causes of pathology. Ultrasound, MRI, and virtual CT colonoscopy have important adjunct roles for screening and workup of complications in specific patient populations. While diverticular disease most commonly involves the descending and sigmoid colon, it can also affect the proximal colon and small bowel.

Acute diverticulitis may be categorized as uncomplicated or complicated according to the degree of inflammatory changes and related complications it induces, although some degree of overlap exists in clinical practice. Uncomplicated diverticulitis is classically characterized by localized inflammation surrounding a diverticulum, ranging from wall thickening and phlegmonous change to the development of small, localized pericolic abscesses. Complicated forms of the disease manifest with larger pericolic and distant abscesses, fistulae to adjacent organs, perforation, and peritonitis. Episodes of diverticulitis may lead to muscular hypertrophy of the bowel wall and luminal narrowing, potentially leading to bowel obstruction.

Several imaging features may help to differentiate diverticulitis from colonic malignancy; however, this remains a diagnostic imaging challenge that often requires further evaluation with colonoscopy.

### Meta-analysis of the role of colonoscopy after an episode of left-sided acute diverticulitis [^117LyXok]. The British Journal of Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The incidence rates of acute diverticulitis have been increasing rapidly over recent decades. Acute diverticulitis has traditionally been associated with an increased risk of colorectal malignancy, which has led to routine colonic evaluation by colonoscopy after the episode of acute diverticulitis has resolved. However, a causal association between colonic diverticulitis or diverticulosis and malignancy has never been found. The association is most likely explained by misdiagnosis of colorectal malignancy as acute diverticulitis. The fact that acute diverticulitis used to be diagnosed based on the clinical picture or barium enemas, and later on by ultrasonography, probably increased the number of misdiagnoses and thereby played a role in establishing the association between acute diverticulitis and colorectal malignancy.

CT has a higher accuracy for the detection of an alternative diagnosis such as colorectal carcinoma. If this were accurate enough, colonoscopy would not be needed in every patient, thereby reducing the healthcare burden and colonoscopy-related morbidity.

Even though the risk of colorectal carcinoma in patients with acute diverticulitis has been the topic of debate in multiple studies, there remains a lack of clarity. The majority of guidelines still recommend routine colonoscopy after an episode of acute diverticulitis. The objective of this review was to assess the role of colonoscopy in patients with CT-proven acute diverticulitis in detecting colorectal carcinoma.

### Outpatient treatment of uncomplicated diverticulitis: A systematic review [^1144uKss]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2016). Low credibility.

Acute diverticulitis occurs in up to 25% of patients with diverticulosis. The majority of cases are mild or uncomplicated and have become a frequent reason for consultation in the emergency department. On the basis of the National Inpatient Sample database from the United States, 86% of patients admitted with diverticulitis were treated with medical therapy. However, several recent studies have shown that outpatient treatment with antibiotics is safe and effective.

The aim of this systematic review is to update the evidence published on the outpatient treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. A systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines, searching in the MEDLINE and Cochrane databases for all English-language articles on the management of acute diverticulitis using the search terms: 'diverticulitis', 'outpatient', and 'uncomplicated'. Data were extracted independently by two investigators.

A total of 11 articles were selected for full review: one randomized controlled trial, eight prospective cohort studies, and two retrospective cohort studies. The treatment success rate on an outpatient basis, defined as the absence of further complications, ranged from 91.5% to 100%. Fewer than 8% of patients were readmitted to the hospital. Intolerance to oral intake and lack of family or social support are common exclusion criteria for this approach, whereas severe comorbidities are not definitive exclusion criteria in all the studies. Ambulatory treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis is safe, effective, and economically efficient.

### Observational versus antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis: an individual-patient data meta-analysis [^113yJpdz]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

The decision to treat patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis with or without antibiotics does not depend on a single outcome measure. All reasons in favor of using antibiotics and omitting them should be considered. Omitting antibiotics did not increase the risk of ongoing diverticulitis, recurrent diverticulitis, complicated diverticulitis, or sigmoid resection, and is therefore a safe treatment strategy.

There is insufficient statistical power to detect small differences in complicated diverticulitis and sigmoid resection, which may leave some room for discussion if these small differences are considered clinically relevant. Furthermore, the use of antibiotics should be limited as much as possible to minimize the global threat of rising microbial resistance and to prevent antibiotic-related morbidity (8.3 percent of all patients in DIABOLO 2), including potentially life-threatening allergic reactions.

In the end, individual-patient characteristics or preferences may be deciding factors in the decision-making process. However, in subgroups of patients with independent risk factors for adverse outcomes (high pain scores, high WBC, and a history of acute diverticulitis at presentation), no beneficial role for antibiotics in preventing such adverse outcomes was found.

### 2020 update of the WSES guidelines for the management of acute colonic diverticulitis in the emergency setting [^117LCw2H]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

A prospective, single-arm study overviewed the safety and efficacy of symptomatic (non-antibiotic) treatment for CT-proven uncomplicated acute diverticulitis during a 30-day follow-up period. Overall, 161 patients were included in the study, and 153 (95%) completed the 30-day follow-up. A total of 14 (9%) patients had pericolic gas. Altogether, 140 (87%) patients were treated as outpatients, and 4 (3%) of them were admitted to the hospital during the follow-up. The primary outcome measure of the study was to find the incidence of complicated diverticulitis. None of the patients developed complicated diverticulitis or required surgery, but two days (median) after inclusion, antibiotics were given to 14 (9%; 6 orally, 8 intravenously) patients.

A recent Dutch randomized controlled trial of observational versus systemic antibiotic treatment (DIABOLO trial) for a first episode of CT-proven ALCD Hinchey stages 1a and 1b confirmed that observational treatment without antibiotics did not prolong recovery and could be considered appropriate in these patients.

This study included 22 clinical sites involving 528 patients; Hinchey modified stages 1a (confined pericolic inflammation or phlegmon) to 1b (pericolic or mesocolic abscess) and Ambrosetti's "mild/moderate" diverticulitis stage confirmed within 24 hours by CT were included. Patients with previous diverticulitis, higher Hinchey stages, or "severe" diverticulitis on Ambrosetti's classification were excluded. The antibiotic treatment was a 10-day course of IV amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, 1200 mg four times daily for at least 48 hours.

### Unmet needs in treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease and prevention of recurrent acute diverticulitis: a scoping review [^115fXx7s]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

No additional studies following the publication of the two systematic reviews were identified, nor were studies on lifestyle interventions. The lack of intervention studies evaluating the effects of smoking cessation or body weight reduction/physical activity promotion on diverticular disease (DD) certainly falls among the unmet needs linked to the management of symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD). In fact, although epidemiological studies suggest an important protective role of lifestyle habits on the risk of DD, no study conducted on SUDD patients is available.

Overall, epidemiological studies indirectly provide a rationale for assessing the efficacy of lifestyle interventions to prevent DD complications even in SUDD patients.

- **Medical treatment in patients with SUDD, without previous diverticulitis**: It has been proposed that gut microbiota imbalance is one of the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying symptomatic DD. On this basis, rifaximin, a broad-spectrum non-absorbable antibiotic, has been tested as a possible treatment for symptom relief in DD. In a systematic review, Maconi et al. examined the evidence regarding the role of medical therapy in reducing symptoms and preventing acute diverticulitis. Overall, 31 prospective clinical studies were analyzed, which presented high heterogeneity in the study design, inclusion criteria, patient characteristics, treatment regimens, and combinations and outcome types. This heterogeneity precluded quantitative synthesis of the results, limiting their interpretation.

### Observational versus antibiotic treatment for uncomplicated diverticulitis: an individual-patient data meta-analysis [^114iKtUj]. The British Journal of Surgery (2020). Low credibility.

Uncomplicated acute diverticulitis has been treated routinely with antibiotics for decades, although several guidelines have adapted their recommendations in the meantime. These now state that antibiotics should not be used routinely or can be avoided. Some guidelines, however, state that antibiotics "should be used selectively" (American Gastroenterological Association Institute guideline), that antibiotics "should be given to patients with risk indications of a complicated course" (German guideline), or that antibiotics "on a case‐by‐case basis should possibly be considered" (Italian guideline).

Little is known, however, about risk factors for a complicated course of initially uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. Therefore, guidelines cannot recommend antibiotics for specific patient subgroups, besides those subgroups that were excluded from studies on this topic, such as immunocompromised patients and women. The present meta-analysis identified several risk factors for one or more adverse outcomes that can guide the selection of patients who may benefit from antibiotics. However, the results showed that omitting antibiotics does not increase the risk of adverse outcomes in these high-risk patients. Therefore, prevention of these adverse outcomes with antibiotic treatment may not be warranted.

### AGA clinical practice update on medical management of colonic diverticulitis: Expert review [^112onW6f]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding preventative measures for acute diverticulitis, particularly concerning secondary prevention, the AGA 2021 guidelines recommend advising patients with a history of diverticulitis to adopt lifestyle modifications. These include consuming a high-quality diet, achieving or maintaining a normal BMI, staying physically active, and avoiding smoking to reduce the risk of recurrence.

### United States guidelines for diverticulitis treatment [^114jzNeW]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2016). Low credibility.

Guidelines for diverticular disease management were last supported and published by the American Gastroenterology Association and the American College of Gastroenterology two decades ago. Although guidelines have been published in other countries and by some societies, these are suggested as United States of America guidelines. However, in reality, they reflect practices at Yale New Haven hospitals in Connecticut.

The epidemiology and pathophysiology are described in detail. This condition is still considered a dietary fiber-deficiency disease, leading to high intracolonic pressure and resultant outpocketing of diverticula at the weakest points of the colon, specifically at sites of vascular penetration with developing elastin deposition in the colon wall. Age and gender distribution are explored, noting that diverticula are most common in the sigmoid colon.

- **Guidelines of management**: Described according to the accepted classification of the disease, encompassing all stages from onset to early formation, mild disease, complicated disease, and rare specific states. Outcomes and mortality are also discussed.

### Emerging evidence and recent controversies in diverticulitis: a 5-year review [^115G3cS9]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

The management of uncomplicated diverticulitis, particularly regarding the need for antibiotics, has been under scrutiny for at least a decade. Several well-designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have provided Level I evidence, informing numerous society recommendations about the omission of antibiotics in uncomplicated diverticulitis. However, this approach has not yet gained as much traction in American populations as it has in the European populations where it was originally studied.

The AVOD trial, initially published in 2012, followed Swedish patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis who were randomized to treatment with or without antibiotics. Neither the initial study nor the recent long-term follow-up published in 2019 suggested any differences in outcomes between the two groups. At a median follow-up of 11 years, similar rates of recurrence, surgery, and development of colorectal cancer (CRC) were observed in both groups.

The Dutch Diverticular Disease (3D) Study Group published the DIABOLO RCT in 2017 with similar findings, suggesting the safety of avoiding antibiotic therapy in patients with uncomplicated diverticulitis. No significant differences were found at 6 months in days to recovery, recurrence, readmission rates, mortality, or other endpoints. Their 24-month follow-up published in 2018 also supported this conclusion.

Despite solid evidence refuting the routine use of antibiotics in uncomplicated diverticulitis, controversy remains. A 2018 joint survey of members of the Society… (Note: The text appears to be incomplete here. Further content may be needed to complete this section.)

### Safety and efficacy of faecal microbiota transplantation in patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis: Study protocol for a randomised placebo-controlled trial [^117ESJKx]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2025). High credibility.

Due to uncomplicated diverticulitis being a common disease and lacking treatment with convincing clinical evidence, the identification of new treatment modalities is essential. Recent studies have shown that the use of antibiotics in this patient group no longer holds any clear evidence, and all patients with acute uncomplicated diverticulitis participating in this study would not receive any other treatment. Furthermore, the role of gut microbiota in the disease course of diverticulitis and whether manipulation of the gut milieu can be beneficial in this condition is still relatively unknown. The findings will contribute to the advancement of knowledge in the aetiology and treatment of diverticulitis and provide a more thorough understanding of how the intestinal microbiota influences our health.

The study will also establish a research biobank, which will contribute as a valuable resource for future microbiome and gastrointestinal research. Consequently, from a scientific and ethical perspective, it is essential to conduct this trial while considering its advantages and disadvantages. Dissemination will occur through publications in international peer-reviewed journals and presentations at conferences. Positive as well as negative results will be published.

### Emerging evidence and recent controversies in diverticulitis: a 5-year review [^1151qznQ]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2021). Low credibility.

Diverticulitis is a common gastrointestinal disease that continues to attract significant attention and study due to its heterogeneous presentation and outcomes. This review provides an overview of the newest and most controversial topics in diverticulitis. Recent discoveries on the influence of diet and other environmental risk factors are discussed, illustrating how the epidemiology of the disease is shifting from being predominantly a disorder of older Western populations. Notably, genetic mutations and variations associated with the development of diverticulitis are being discovered and are summarized here. The data supporting non-operative and outpatient management of diverticulitis, as well as pharmacologic agents studied for use in its secondary prevention, are reviewed. Lastly, controversies in the surgical treatment of diverticulitis are presented. This review offers a synopsis of the last 5 years of literature related to diverticulitis.

### Unmet needs in treatment of symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease and prevention of recurrent acute diverticulitis: a scoping review [^1112iBpP]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2024). Low credibility.

In addition, a further double-blind placebo-controlled RCT not included in the previous systematic review, involved 120 SUDD patients treated for three months with either (i) supplementation of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Lactobacillus plantarum (1 ml/kg/day) or (ii) placebo. Alteration of bowel habits (constipation, diarrhea), mucorrhea, and back pain were significantly reduced in patients supplemented with probiotics, although the reduction of abdominal pain was similar between groups.

A reduction in abdominal swelling and pain in subjects with SUDD is associated with the use of L. acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, and Bifidobacterium spp. 420 or Lactobacillus paracasei has been documented in non-randomized studies or smaller RCTs.

Overall, the evidence supporting the role of probiotics in SUDD is based on small, heterogeneous studies of generally poor methodological quality. Furthermore, existing studies mainly focused on symptoms, and there is a substantial lack of information regarding the possible role of probiotics in reducing the risk of diverticulitis.

- **Dietary and lifestyle interventions in patients with previous diverticulitis with or without GI symptoms**: Evidence regarding the role of fiber intake in preventing the recurrence of diverticulitis is scant.

In 2018, a systematic review identified three studies in which dietary fiber intake was modified after an acute episode of uncomplicated diverticulitis. Although all three studies reported data on symptoms and two out of three on diverticulitis relapses, the absence in t

### AGA clinical practice update on medical management of colonic diverticulitis: Expert review [^113rd1tP]. Gastroenterology (2021). High credibility.

Regarding follow-up and surveillance for acute diverticulitis, particularly concerning endoscopic follow-up for uncomplicated diverticulitis, the AGA 2021 guidelines recommend obtaining a colonoscopy following a first episode of uncomplicated diverticulitis. This recommendation is based on the patient's history, their most recent colonoscopy, and the severity and course of the disease. Consider deferring a colonoscopy if a high-quality examination was performed within the past year, or performing it sooner if alarm symptoms are present.

### Treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis without antibiotics: A systematic review and meta-analysis [^115AmS1L]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2019). Low credibility.

Despite low-quality and conflicting evidence, the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland recommends the routine use of antibiotics in the treatment of uncomplicated acute diverticulitis. Recent studies have shown that treatment without antibiotics did not prolong recovery. Some new guidelines currently recommend selective use of antibiotics.

- **Objective**: The purpose of this study was to compare the safety, effectiveness, and outcomes in treating uncomplicated acute diverticulitis without antibiotics versus treatment with antibiotics.

- **Data sources**: PubMed, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Cochrane Library were searched with the keywords "antibiotics" and "diverticulitis".

- **Study selection**: All studies published in English on treating uncomplicated acute diverticulitis without antibiotics and involving more than 20 individuals were included.

- **Intervention**: Treatment without antibiotics versus treatment with antibiotics were compared.

- **Main outcome measures**: The primary outcome was the percentage of patients requiring additional treatment or intervention to settle the initial episode. Secondary outcomes were duration of hospital stay, rate of readmission or deferred admission, need for surgical or radiological intervention, recurrence, and complication.

- **Results**: The search yielded 1,164 studies. Nine studies were eligible and included in the meta-analysis, comprising 2,505 patients — 1,663 were treated without antibiotics and 842 treated with an antibiotic. The no-antibiotics group had a significantly shorter hospital stay (mean difference = -0.

### Treatment of diverticular disease of the colon and prevention of acute diverticulitis: A systematic review [^116zJ56o]. Diseases of the Colon and Rectum (2011). Low credibility.

Diverticular disease of the colon is a common disorder characterized by symptoms and complications such as diverticulitis, which often require hospital admissions and surgery.

- **Objective**: This study aimed to systematically review the evidence for medical therapy of diverticular disease in reducing symptoms and preventing acute diverticulitis.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE and Embase databases were used, covering literature from 1966 to February 2010.

- **Study selection**: The studies selected were prospective clinical trials focusing on uncomplicated diverticular disease of the colon.

- **Interventions**: Four investigators independently reviewed articles, extracted data, and assessed study quality according to standardized criteria.

- **Main outcome measures**: The main outcomes measured were improvement in symptoms, complete remission of symptoms, and prevention of acute diverticulitis.

- **Results**: Thirty-one studies were identified, including six placebo-controlled trials. The methodological quality of these studies was suboptimal. Only 10 trials provided a detailed description of patient history; eight assessed symptoms using a validated questionnaire, and 14 appropriately defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Notably, only one long-term double-blind placebo-controlled study was identified, which reported a significant improvement in symptoms and a greater prevalence of symptom-free patients at one year with fiber plus rifaximin compared to fiber alone. The efficacy of treatment in preventing acute diverticulitis was evaluated in 11 randomized trials. Four trials compared rifaximin plus fiber versus fiber alone and failed to show a significant benefit.

Regarding the medical management of acute diverticulitis, particularly antibiotic therapy, the WSES 2020 guidelines recommend considering percutaneous drainage combined with antibiotic therapy in patients with large abscesses. If the clinical condition permits and percutaneous drainage is not feasible or available, consider administering an initial treatment with antibiotic therapy alone. Perform an operative intervention as an alternative option.
