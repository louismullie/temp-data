## Question

What are the common symptoms experienced by women during menopause?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the common symptoms experienced by women during menopause, with interest in how these symptoms are organized by domain, their prevalence, timing, and clinical significance. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology that links symptoms to estrogen decline. Then, I should categorize symptoms into major domains and verify prevalence estimates. Next, I will examine temporal patterns and persistence, followed by risk modifiers. Finally, I will synthesize a concise, clinically useful summary and double-check that each assertion aligns with high-quality sources.

> Let me first confirm the pathophysiologic foundation, because symptom interpretation hinges on it. Menopause reflects ovarian follicle depletion with falling estradiol and progesterone, producing direct effects on thermoregulation, genitourinary tissues, sleep–wake circuits, mood regulation, and musculoskeletal integrity; this hormonal milieu explains why symptoms cluster and why their severity and duration vary across women [^1149FNSf] [^116M6Lgb].

> I will now examine vasomotor symptoms, since these are the hallmark and most commonly reported. Wait, let me verify the prevalence range before I commit to a number: contemporary summaries report hot flashes and night sweats in up to 80% of women, with moderate–severe symptoms in roughly 11–46% and a median total duration around 7–9 years, and in about one-third, symptoms persist beyond a decade. This aligns with guideline statements and large reviews, so I can confidently anchor on these figures [^115YbQnG] [^115q1RCS] [^1139iWPf].

> Next, I should review genitourinary syndrome of menopause, and I need to ensure I separate progressive tissue changes from transient symptoms. GSM affects about 40–60% of postmenopausal women and includes vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, irritation, and urinary symptoms; unlike vasomotor symptoms, GSM tends to be progressive and does not remit without treatment, which is clinically important for long-term management planning [^116uyown] [^1139iWPf] [^11112nGf].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about sleep and mood being purely secondary to vasomotor symptoms. Sleep disturbance is highly prevalent during and after the menopause transition, often with frequent awakenings and prolonged time awake, and it can occur even in the absence of hot flashes. Mood symptoms, including depressive symptoms and anxiety, also rise in the menopausal transition, with a recognized window of vulnerability for new-onset or recurrent depression, particularly in those with prior episodes or concurrent vasomotor symptoms [^112xyLQA] [^114WHzb9] [^114JTKhf] [^115brjLd].

> I should confirm the somatic and musculoskeletal complaints next. Joint and muscle aches are commonly reported and can cluster with other symptom domains. Fatigue and reduced energy are frequent, and while some cognitive complaints are reported, I need to be careful not to over-attribute them to hormones alone, as aging and sleep disruption also contribute. Nonetheless, transient cognitive changes can occur during the transition [^1139iWPf] [^113db1pe] [^115brjLd].

> Let me consider sexual function and libido, and I should double-check that I frame this within both hormonal and psychosocial contexts. Decreased sexual desire and dyspareunia are common, with prevalence estimates varying by region and methodology; in Asia, systematic reviews suggest high prevalence of diminished desire and vulvovaginal atrophy symptoms postmenopause, though under-reporting and heterogeneity limit precision, reinforcing the need to ask directly and use validated tools when needed [^111QbbeU] [^1139iWPf].

> I need to check the temporal patterns and persistence because they guide counseling and treatment sequencing. Vasomotor symptoms typically intensify through perimenopause, peak around one year after the final menstrual period, and then gradually decline, yet a substantial minority have persistent symptoms beyond 10 years; genitourinary symptoms generally progress and persist without local therapy; sleep and mood symptoms often emerge in late perimenopause and can persist into early postmenopause, with trajectories varying by individual risk and context [^115YbQnG] [^1139iWPf] [^115brjLd].

> But wait, what if symptom severity and clustering differ by population or phenotype? I should review modifiers. Risk of more severe vasomotor symptoms is higher with smoking, obesity, depression, and surgical or premature menopause. Women with a history of premenstrual disorders have higher risks of early menopause and moderate–severe vasomotor symptoms. Women living with HIV report high burdens of joint pain, exhaustion, sleep problems, and vasomotor symptoms, underscoring the need for proactive screening in special populations [^1149FNSf] [^114LBGS3] [^115ty8Yn] [^116oFS9n].

> Let me synthesize the clinical picture succinctly, and I should confirm I am not overstating any domain. The most common menopausal symptoms include vasomotor symptoms in up to 80%, genitourinary symptoms in 40–60%, sleep disturbance and mood changes that often co-occur with vasomotor symptoms, somatic complaints including joint and muscle pain, and sexual dysfunction including decreased libido and dyspareunia; these symptoms can present in any combination, vary in severity and duration, and may persist for years, particularly vasomotor symptoms in a subset and genitourinary symptoms without local therapy [^115YbQnG] [^116uyown] [^1139iWPf] [^115brjLd].

> Finally, I should double-check that my framing aligns with guideline-based care implications, even if treatment details are not the primary request. Recognizing these symptom domains supports individualized management, with menopausal hormone therapy as the most effective option for vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms in appropriately selected women, and nonhormonal therapies for those with contraindications or preferences; persistent genitourinary symptoms warrant local estrogen or approved alternatives, and sleep and mood symptoms merit direct assessment and targeted interventions rather than assuming they will resolve with vasomotor control alone [^1139iWPf] [^113zpxEK] [^1132HYD1].

---

The most common symptoms of menopause are **vasomotor symptoms** (hot flashes and night sweats) [^115YbQnG], **vaginal dryness and sexual dysfunction** [^1149FNSf], and **sleep disturbances** [^112xyLQA]. Other frequent symptoms include mood changes, cognitive complaints, joint and muscle pain, and fatigue [^1139iWPf] [^1176wCPP]. These symptoms vary in severity and duration [^115brjLd], often peaking during the menopausal transition and early postmenopause, and can significantly affect quality of life [^1139iWPf].

---

## Vasomotor symptoms

Vasomotor symptoms are the **hallmark of menopause**, occurring in up to 80% of women [^115YbQnG] and often lasting several years [^115q1RCS]. They include:

- **Hot flashes**: Sudden sensations of heat, often accompanied by sweating and flushing, typically lasting 1–5 minutes [^notfound].

- **Night sweats**: Hot flashes occurring during sleep, often causing significant sleep disruption [^112xyLQA].

- **Duration**: Vasomotor symptoms commonly persist for 7–9 years, with about one-third of women experiencing symptoms for more than 10 years [^115YbQnG].

---

## Genitourinary symptoms

Declining estrogen levels lead to **genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM)** [^113zpxEK], characterized by:

- **Vaginal dryness**: Thinning and dryness of the vaginal mucosa, often causing discomfort and itching [^111QbbeU].

- **Dyspareunia**: Painful intercourse due to vaginal dryness and atrophy [^111QbbeU].

- **Urinary symptoms**: Increased frequency, urgency, and recurrent urinary tract infections [^notfound].

---

## Sleep disturbances

Sleep disturbances are highly prevalent during menopause [^112xyLQA], often related to vasomotor symptoms and hormonal changes [^112xyLQA]. Manifestations include **insomnia** — difficulty falling or staying asleep, frequent awakenings, and poor sleep quality — and **daytime fatigue**, with reduced energy and tiredness impacting daily functioning [^112xyLQA].

---

## Mood and cognitive symptoms

Many women experience **mood and cognitive changes** during menopause, including:

- **Mood swings**: Irritability, anxiety, and depressive symptoms [^114JTKhf].

- **Cognitive complaints**: Difficulty with memory, concentration, and attention [^113db1pe].

- **Window of vulnerability**: The menopausal transition is associated with increased risk of depression and anxiety, particularly in women with prior history of mood disorders [^111LT9Ne].

---

## Somatic symptoms

Somatic symptoms are common and include **joint and muscle pain**, with increased prevalence of arthralgia and myalgia during menopause [^notfound], and **fatigue**, with persistent tiredness and reduced stamina [^113g5aFo].

---

## Summary of common menopausal symptoms

| **Symptom category** | **Common symptoms** |
|-|-|
| Vasomotor | - Hot flashes <br/> - Night sweats |
| Genitourinary | - Vaginal dryness <br/> - Dyspareunia <br/> - Urinary frequency/urgency |
| Sleep | - Insomnia <br/> - Daytime fatigue |
| Mood and cognitive | - Mood swings <br/> - Anxiety <br/> - Depression <br/> - Cognitive complaints |
| Somatic | - Joint and muscle pain <br/> - Fatigue |

---

The most common symptoms of menopause include vasomotor symptoms, genitourinary symptoms, sleep disturbances, mood and cognitive changes, and somatic symptoms such as joint pain and fatigue [^1149FNSf]. These symptoms vary widely in severity and duration, often significantly impacting **quality of life** [^1139iWPf].

### Protocol for development of a core outcome set for menopausal symptoms (COMMA) [^112bHESF]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Menopause is the natural cessation of menstruation and may be accompanied by troublesome symptoms including hot flushes and night sweats (vasomotor symptoms) and genitourinary symptoms. Randomized trials evaluating the safety and effectiveness of interventions for these symptoms have reported a wide range of outcomes and used inconsistent measures. This variation precludes comparing and combining data from different trials. To overcome this limitation, we will develop a Core Outcome Set for Menopausal Symptoms.

Methods

We will systematically review the literature to identify the outcomes reported in the interventional trials for vasomotor and genitourinary symptoms. This list will be entered into a two-round modified Delphi survey to be completed by clinicians, researchers, and consumers (women who have experienced menopause). Participants will score outcomes on a nine-point scale from "not important" to "critically important". Representatives from each stakeholder group will then meet to discuss the results and finalize the Core Outcome Set. Ethics approval was not required as this was considered service evaluation and development. The study is registered with the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials Initiative (http://www.comet-initiative.org/studies/details/917).

Results

An agreed upon set of minimum outcomes and outcome measures will facilitate combining and comparing findings from future trials of treatments for menopausal symptoms.

Conclusions

This Core Outcome Set will better enable women and clinicians to select effective treatments, improve the quality of trial reporting, reduce research wastage, and improve care for women with troublesome menopausal symptoms. VIDEO SUMMARY:: http://links.lww.com/MENO/A633.

### Oral oestrogen and combined oestrogen / progestogen therapy versus placebo for hot flushes [^114dgEU3]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Hot flushes and night sweats are common symptoms experienced by menopausal women. Hormone therapy (HT), containing oestrogens alone or oestrogens together with progestogens in a cyclic or continuous regimen, is often recommended for their alleviation.

Objectives

To examine the effect of oral HT compared to placebo on these vasomotor symptoms and the risk of early onset side-effects.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders Group and Subfertility Group trials register (searched May 2002). This register is based on regular searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PsycINFO, the handsearching of 20 relevant journals and conference proceedings, and searches of several key grey literature sources. We also contacted all relevant pharmaceutical companies, The Journal of the International Menopause Society and Climacteric.

Selection Criteria

Double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trials of oral HT for at least three months duration.

Data Collection and Analysis

Study quality and outcome data were assessed independently. Random effects models were considered appropriate due to the variety of trial methodologies. The meta-analyses were explored for sensitivity to trial quality and therapy duration. Symptom frequency and severity were assessed separately, together with withdrawals and side-effects. Frequency data were analysed using the Weighted Mean Difference (WMD) between treatment and placebo outcomes. For severity data, odds ratios were estimated from the proportional odds model. From 115 references originally identified, 24 trials meeting the selection criteria were included in the review. Study participants totaled 3,329. Trial duration ranged from three months to three years.

Main Results

There was a significant reduction in the weekly hot flush frequency for HT compared to placebo (WMD -17.92, 95% CI -22.86 to -12.99). This was equivalent to a 75% reduction in frequency (95% CI 64.3 to 82.3) for HT relative to placebo. Symptom severity was also significantly reduced compared to placebo (OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.23). Withdrawal for lack of efficacy occurred significantly more often on placebo therapy (OR 10.51, 95% CI 5.00 to 22.09). Withdrawal for adverse events, commonly breast tenderness, oedema, joint pain and psychological symptoms, was not significantly increased (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.90), although the occurrence of any adverse events was significantly increased for HT (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.99). In women who were randomised to placebo treatment, a 57.7% (95% CI 45.1 to 67.7) reduction in hot flushes was observed between baseline and end of study.

Reviewers' Conclusions

Oral HT is highly effective in alleviating hot flushes and night sweats. Therapies purported to reduce such symptoms must be assessed in blinded trials against a placebo or a validated therapy because of the large placebo effect seen in well conducted randomised controlled trials, and also because during menopause symptoms may fluctuate and after menopause symptoms often decline. Withdrawals due to side-effects were only marginally increased in the HT groups despite the inability to tailor HT in these fixed dose trials. Comparisons of hormonal doses, product types or regimens require analysis of trials with these specific "within study" comparisons.

### Impact of sleep disturbances on health-related quality of life in postmenopausal women: a systematic review [^114WHzb9]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

Importance

Sleep disturbances are common during and after the menopause transition, with potential effects on morbidity and quality of life; however, they may be underdiagnosed and undertreated.

Objective

We carried out a systematic literature review to investigate the prevalence and impact of sleep disturbances associated with menopause on women's health-related quality of life across the stages of menopause.

Evidence Review

Searches were conducted in PubMed and Excerpta Medica Database to identify articles published between 2013 and 2023 containing evidence for the impact of sleep quality on health-related quality of life and the epidemiology of sleep disturbances in women in menopause.

Findings

In total, 29 publications focusing on epidemiological outcomes of sleep disturbances and 28 studies focusing on the impact of sleep quality on health-related quality of life were identified. Overall, these studies confirmed the high prevalence of sleep disturbances in postmenopausal women. Risk factors for sleep disturbances included menopausal status, depression, vasomotor symptoms, high glycemic index diets, and age. Notably, sleep disturbances were identified even in the absence of vasomotor symptoms. Sleep disturbances were significantly associated with impaired menopause-specific and general health-related quality of life, including depression, anxiety, and musculoskeletal pain. Sleep disturbances were also associated with reduced work productivity and the ability to perform daily activities.

Conclusions and Relevance

Healthy sleep is important at all life stages, including during menopause. Our review indicates that sleep disturbances are highly prevalent during postmenopausal years, even among women without vasomotor symptoms, and can severely impact women's well-being and quality of life. This study highlights the importance of promoting increased awareness and developing tailored treatment strategies for sleep disturbances in midlife and beyond.

### Exercise for vasomotor menopausal symptoms [^113LaY5E]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence suggests that many perimenopausal and early postmenopausal women will experience menopausal symptoms; hot flushes are the most common. Symptoms caused by fluctuating levels of oestrogen may be alleviated by hormone therapy (HT), but a marked global decline in its use has resulted from concerns about the risks and benefits of HT. Consequently, many women are seeking alternatives. As large numbers of women are choosing not to take HT, it is increasingly important to identify evidence-based lifestyle modifications that have the potential to reduce vasomotor menopausal symptoms.

Objectives

To examine the effectiveness of any type of exercise intervention in the management of vasomotor symptoms in symptomatic perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.

Search Methods

Searches of the following electronic bibliographic databases were performed to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs): Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Trials Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (Wiley Internet interface), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), the Science Citation Index and the Social Science Citation Index (Web of Science), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (Ovid) and SPORTDiscus. Searches include findings up to 3 March 2014.

Selection Criteria

RCTs in which any type of exercise intervention was compared with no treatment/control or other treatments in the management of menopausal vasomotor symptoms in symptomatic perimenopausal/postmenopausal women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Five studies were deemed eligible for inclusion. Two review authors independently selected the studies, and three review authors independently extracted the data. The primary review outcome was vasomotor symptoms, defined as hot flushes and/or night sweats. We combined data to calculate standardised mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) statistic. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for main comparisons using GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methods.

Main Results

We included five RCTs (733 women) comparing exercise with no active treatment, exercise with yoga and exercise with HT. The evidence was of low quality: Limitations in study design were noted, along with inconsistency and imprecision. In the comparison of exercise versus no active treatment (three studies, n = 454 women), no evidence was found of a difference between groups in frequency or intensity of vasomotor symptoms (SMD -0.10, 95% CI -0.33 to 0.13, three RCTs, 454 women, I(2) = 30%, low-quality evidence). Nor was any evidence found of a difference between groups in the frequency or intensity of vasomotor symptoms when exercise was compared with yoga (SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.45 to 0.38, two studies, n = 279 women, I(2) = 61%, low-quality evidence). It was not possible to include one of the trials in the meta-analyses; this trial compared three groups: exercise plus soy milk, soy milk only and control; results favoured exercise relative to the comparators, but study numbers were small. One trial compared exercise with HT, and the HT group reported significantly fewer flushes in 24 hours than the exercise group (mean difference 5.8, 95% CI 3.17 to 8.43, 14 participants). None of the trials found evidence of a difference between groups with respect to adverse effects, but data were very scanty.

Authors' Conclusions

Evidence was insufficient to show whether exercise is an effective treatment for vasomotor menopausal symptoms. One small study suggested that HT is more effective than exercise. Evidence was insufficient to show the relative effectiveness of exercise when compared with HT or yoga.

### Onset of the menopause transition: the earliest signs and symptoms [^112xJQ2f]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Although more than 80% of women experience some degree of psychological or physical symptoms around menopause, both women and clinicians have misconceptions about how hormonal changes relate to menopausal symptoms and psychological conditions. Recently, several large-scale, longitudinal studies have been conducted to better characterize symptoms and changes that occur around menopause. This article offers current evidence for symptoms that occur in the early menopause transition, including vasomotor symptoms, mood changes, sleep problems, and changes in sexual functioning.

### Managing menopause after cancer [^115wWLmZ]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

Globally, 9 million women are diagnosed with cancer each year. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide, followed by colorectal cancer in high-income countries and cervical cancer in low-income countries. Survival from cancer is improving and more women are experiencing long-term effects of cancer treatment, such as premature ovarian insufficiency or early menopause. Managing menopausal symptoms after cancer can be challenging, and more severe than at natural menopause. Menopausal symptoms can extend beyond hot flushes and night sweats (vasomotor symptoms). Treatment-induced symptoms might include sexual dysfunction and impairment of sleep, mood, and quality of life. In the long term, premature ovarian insufficiency might increase the risk of chronic conditions such as osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. Diagnosing menopause after cancer can be challenging as menopausal symptoms can overlap with other common symptoms in patients with cancer, such as fatigue and sexual dysfunction. Menopausal hormone therapy is an effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms and seems to be safe for many patients with cancer. When hormone therapy is contraindicated or avoided, emerging evidence supports the efficacy of non-pharmacological and non-hormonal treatments, although most evidence is based on women older than 50 years with breast cancer. Vaginal oestrogen seems safe for most patients with genitourinary symptoms, but there are few non-hormonal options. Many patients have inadequate centralised care for managing menopausal symptoms after cancer treatment, and more information is needed about cost-effective and patient-focused models of care for this growing population.

### Vasomotor symptoms in menopause: where we' ve been and where we' re going [^113yyVpJ]. Journal of Women's Health (2006). Low credibility.

The decline in gonadal hormones during menopause gives rise to a wide range of physiological and psychological changes with the potential to significantly impact a woman's health and quality of life. Most notable among these are menopausal vasomotor symptoms, hot flushes and night sweats, along with mood and sleep disturbances. Given the biological and social significance of menopause, it is remarkable that the language used to describe this event and its associated symptoms is inconsistent. This review traces the history of Western medical writing about menopause-associated vasomotor symptoms and considers how terminology has contributed to the current confusion regarding symptoms and symptom reporting. Although hormone therapy is the only treatment for menopausal symptoms currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, other forms of therapy are under evaluation. Agreement about the definition of menopause and its associated symptoms is critically important for the design and evaluation of new therapies and for the optimal treatment of women during this important phase of their lives.

### Acute consequences of the menopausal transition: the rise of common menopausal symptoms [^1159dvhx]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

More than 80% of women experience psychologic or physical symptoms in the late reproductive years, with varying degrees of severity and disruption in their lives. Patients and clinicians have misconceptions about what changes are considered "normal" or"abnormal" during this period. Of importance to clinicians, large-scale longitudinal studies recently have been conducted to better characterize and explore changes during this period. This article re-views the current evidence regarding the acute symptoms of the menopausal transition, including vasomotor symptoms, mood changes, sleep problems, and changes in sexual functioning.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 141: management of menopausal symptoms [^115qwheY]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Low credibility.

Vasomotor and vaginal symptoms are cardinal symptoms of menopause. Vasomotor symptoms can be particularly troubling to women and are the most commonly reported menopausal symptoms, with a reported prevalence of 50–82% among U.S. women who experience natural menopause (1, 2). The occurrence of vasomotor symptoms increases during the transition to menopause and peaks approximately 1 year after the final menstrual period (3–5). The purpose of this document is to provide evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of vasomotor and vaginal symptoms related to natural and surgical menopause. (Treatment of menopausal symptoms in cancer survivors is discussed in the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Practice Bulletin Number 126, Management of Gynecologic Issues in Women With Breast Cancer.).

### The many menopauses: searching the cognitive research literature for menopause types [^112wHGMT]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

Menopause is defined as the reproductive condition after 12 consecutive months of amenorrhea. For a majority of women, menopause occurs at an average age of 51 years, as a result of the complex hormonal changes that accompany the reduction in ovarian follicles. Along with a drop in circulating hormone levels, menopause is often associated with the experience of hot flashes, night sweats, sleep problems, mood changes, and vaginal dryness. Despite similar symptoms and the common name of menopause, there is, however, no single pathway to the end of menses. In fact, menstruation ceases for different reasons, in different ways, at different time points in the lifespan, with different health risks.

For a small but significant number of women, menopause occurs earlier than the normative age range. Included in this spectrum of menopauses is premature (younger than 40 y), early (between 40 and 45 y), and induced (oophorectomy with or without hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy [BSO], the removal of ovaries and fallopian tubes, or ovarian ablation through radiation). These different menopause types have distinct hormonal changes both leading up to and after the cessation of menses, potentially leading to different health trajectories. Although not considered an induced menopause, hysterectomy with ovarian sparing has been shown to result in decreased ovarian function. Thus, using menopause as a blanket word to describe any "cessation of menses" erases these differences in the physiology, etiology, and health outcomes of the many menopauses.

### Vasomotor symptoms in menopause: physiologic condition and central nervous system approaches to treatment [^116RTwcZ]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The decline in concentrations of gonadal hormones during menopause gives rise to a range of physiologic and psychologic changes that may impact a woman's health and quality of life significantly. Most notable among these are vasomotor symptoms (hot flashes and night sweats) and mood and sleep disturbances.

Study Design

This article reviews the physiologic condition underlying menopausal vasomotor symptoms and centrally active, nonhormonal therapies that have demonstrated efficacy for their treatment.

Results

Despite the emergence of a range of nonhormonal treatments for vasomotor symptoms, a need still exists for safe and effective therapeutic options that directly target the underlying thermoregulatory mechanisms for women who want treatment but prefer to avoid hormone therapy or for whom hormone therapy is contraindicated.

Conclusion

The availability of centrally active therapies for menopausal vasomotor symptoms with risks and benefits clearly defined by results from well-designed clinical trials has the potential to allay safety concerns that are associated with the treatment of these common symptoms.

### A decade after the women's health initiative – the experts do agree [^1146ThMd]. Fertility and Sterility (2012). Medium credibility.

Menopause hormone therapy — overview and symptom relief benefits emphasize that systemic hormone therapy is an acceptable option for relatively young (up to age 59 or within 10 years of menopause) and healthy women who are bothered by moderate to severe menopausal symptoms, and that individualization is key with consideration of quality-of-life priorities and risk factors including age, time since menopause, and risks of blood clots, heart disease, stroke, and breast cancer. Systemic hormone therapy is the most effective treatment for most menopausal symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms and vaginal atrophy; estrogen therapy as a single agent is sufficient in women who have undergone hysterectomy, whereas progestogen therapy is required to prevent endometrial cancer when estrogen is used systemically in women with a uterus. For symptoms limited to vaginal dryness or discomfort with intercourse, local estrogen therapy is effective and preferred, and low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy is recommended in this setting.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^111g5hPA]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) initiation timing — Current recommendations suggest that the initiation of MHT should generally be limited to women < 60 years of age or < 10 years after menopause onset; evidence in younger, symptomatic women is limited, with no adequately powered RCTs with clinical outcomes, and the best available evidence comes from subgroup analyses of WHI data in women 50 to 59 years of age or < 10 years since menopause onset.

### Estrogen and progestogen use in peri-and postmenopausal women: March 2007 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^114i3Dza]. Menopause (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

To update the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in 2004 regarding recommendations for estrogen and progestogen use in peri- and postmenopausal women.

Design

NAMS followed the general principles established for evidence-based guidelines to create this updated document. An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health was enlisted to review the 2004 NAMS position statement, compile supporting statements, and reach consensus on recommendations. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. The position statements published by NAMS do not represent "practice standards" that would be codified and held up as standards by regulating bodies and insurance agencies. Rather, they are prevailing opinion pieces in a best effort attempt to incorporate current evidence into practical clinical recommendations.

Results

With the primary goal being to evaluate the risk-benefit ratio of peri- and postmenopausal estrogen therapy (ET) and estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT) for both disease prevention and treatment of menopause-related symptoms, current evidence allowed for a clear distinction between areas of consensus and areas for which the Panel determined that there was inadequate evidence for any conclusion to be reached. The document lists all of these areas along with clear explanatory comments. A comprehensive list of key references is provided. The absence of evidence is also recognized in the list of needs for further research recommended by the Panel.

Conclusions

Current evidence supports the use of ET or EPT for menopause-related symptoms and disease prevention in appropriate populations of peri- and postmenopausal women.

### American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists and American college of endocrinology position statement on menopause-2017 update [^1178U8Q1]. Endocrine Practice (2017). Low credibility.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE)/American College of Endocrinology (ACE) Position Statement is designed to update the previous menopause clinical practice guidelines published in 2011 but does not replace them. The current document reviews new clinical trials published since then as well as new information regarding possible risks and benefits of therapies available for the treatment of menopausal symptoms. AACE reinforces the recommendations made in its previous guidelines and provides additional recommendations on the basis of new data. A summary regarding this position statement is listed below: New information available from randomized clinical trials and epidemiologic studies reported after 2011 was critically reviewed. No previous recommendations from the 2011 menopause clinical practice guidelines have been reversed or changed. Newer information enhances AACE's guidance for the use of hormone therapy in different subsets of women. Newer information helps to support the use of various types of estrogens, selective estrogen-receptor modulators (SERMs), and progesterone, as well as the route of delivery. Newer information supports the previous recommendation against the use of bioidentical hormones. The use of nonhormonal therapies for the symptomatic relief of menopausal symptoms is supported. Newer information enhances AACE's guidance for the use of hormone therapy in different subsets of women. Newer information helps to support the use of various types of estrogens, SERMs, and progesterone, as well as the route of delivery. Newer information supports the previous recommendation against the use of bioidentical hormones. The use of nonhormonal therapies for the symptomatic relief of menopausal symptoms is supported. New recommendations in this position statement include: 1.

Recommendation

the use of menopausal hormone therapy in symptomatic postmenopausal women should be based on consideration of all risk factors for cardiovascular disease, age, and time from menopause. 2.

Recommendation

the use of transdermal as compared with oral estrogen preparations may be considered less likely to produce thrombotic risk and perhaps the risk of stroke and coronary artery disease. 3.

Recommendation

when the use of progesterone is necessary, micronized progesterone is considered the safer alternative. 4.

Recommendation

in symptomatic menopausal women who are at significant risk from the use of hormone replacement therapy, the use of selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors and possibly other nonhormonal agents may offer significant symptom relief. 5.

Recommendation

AACE does not recommend use of bioidentical hormone therapy. 6.

Recommendation

AACE fully supports the recommendations of the Comité de l'Évolution des Pratiques en Oncologie regarding the management of menopause in women with breast cancer. 7.

Recommendation

HRT is not recommended for the prevention of diabetes. 8.

Recommendation

In women with previously diagnosed diabetes, the use of HRT should be individualized, taking in to account age, metabolic, and cardiovascular risk factors.

### Variation in outcome reporting and measurement tools in clinical trials of treatments for genitourinary symptoms in peri-and postmenopausal women: a systematic review [^116uyown]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Importance

Genitourinary symptoms affect 40% to 60% of postmenopausal women. Evidence-based approaches to diagnosing and managing these symptoms are limited by inconsistencies in outcomes and measures used in clinical trials.

Objective

The aim of the study was to systematically review all outcomes and measurement tools reported in randomized clinical trials of interventions for genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause.

Evidence Review

We searched PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) up to December 2018. Randomized controlled trials with a primary or secondary outcome of genitourinary symptoms associated with menopause, English language, and sample size of 20 or more women per study arm were included. Study characteristics, outcomes, and measurement methods were collected.

Findings

The search yielded 3,478 articles of which 109 met inclusion criteria. Forty-eight different outcomes were reported with "atrophy" as the most common (56/109, 51%) followed by measures of sexual function (19/109, 17%). Almost all (108/109, 99%) trials included patient-reported measures, with 21 different measures and 39 symptom combinations. Clinician-reported scales of vulvovaginal appearance were used in 36 of 109 (33%) trials, with extensive variation in what was measured and reported. Cytological measures from the vaginal epithelium were the most commonly used objective tools (76/109, 70%).

Conclusions and Relevance

There is heterogeneity in reported outcomes and measures used in clinical trials of treatments for genitourinary symptoms at menopause and uncertainty as to which outcomes best reflect patient priorities and symptoms. The findings from this systematic review have informed an international survey of stakeholders to determine priorities for outcome selection and reporting. This survey will then inform the development of a Core Outcome Set for use in future clinical trials by the COMMA (Core OutcoMes in MenopAuse) consortium.: Video Summary:http://links.lww.com/MENO/A599.

Conclusion — indication for hormone therapy — states that leading medical societies devoted to the care of menopausal women agree that the decision to initiate hormone therapy should be for the indication of treatment of menopause-related symptoms, and although research is ongoing and these recommendations may be modified over time, there is no question that hormone therapy has an important role in managing symptoms for women during the menopausal transition and in early menopause.

### Can depression be a menopause-associated risk? [^114JTKhf]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

There is little doubt that women experience a heightened psychiatric morbidity compared to men. A growing body of evidence suggests that, for some women, the menopausal transition and early postmenopausal years may represent a period of vulnerability associated with an increased risk of experiencing symptoms of depression, or for the development of an episode of major depressive disorder. Recent research has begun to shed some light on potential mechanisms that influence this vulnerability. At the same time, a number of studies and clinical trials conducted over the past decade have provided important data regarding efficacy and safety of preventative measures and treatment strategies for midlife women; some of these studies have caused a shift in the current thinking of how menopausal symptoms should be appropriately managed. Essentially, most women will progress from premenopausal into postmenopausal years without developing significant depressive symptoms. However, those with prior history of depression may face a re-emergence of depression during this transition while others may experience a first episode of depression in their lives. Here I provide an overview of what is known about risk factors for depression and the risk posed by the menopausal transition, its associated symptoms, and the underlying changes in the reproductive hormonal milieu, discussing the evidence for the occurrence of mood symptoms in midlife women and the challenges that face clinicians and health professionals who care for this population.

### NAMS 2019 pre-meeting symposium, September 2019, Chicago Illinois: the perimenopause [^112ckXh4]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

The North American Menopause Society held the 2019 Pre-Meeting Symposium on September 25, 2019, in Chicago, Illinois, to review the current state of the science related to the physiology of the perimenopause and to address management of the most prevalent and pressing clinical issues. The perimenopause, as defined by the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop + 10, encompasses the menopause transition as well as the first year following menopause, the final menstrual period. This phase in the continuum of women's reproductive lives had been one of the least well understood. Fortunately, contributions from a number of prospective, longitudinal, decades-long studies have provided a better understanding of the perimenopause, whereas posing important new questions related to symptom interaction and linkages between symptoms and long-term health. There is now added clarity to distinguish the effects of reproductive hormonal changes from aging. The variation in symptoms, including vasomotor symptoms, among women over time including differences in experiences by ethnicity and race, provides paradigm shifts in clinical perspective. Refinements in understanding the character, timing, and potential predictive markers for menstrual cycles during the transition have emerged. From the perspective of myriad clinical management challenges, significant progress in recommendations for evaluation and therapeutic approaches has been achieved. Finally, recognizing the menopause transition as an opportunity to initiate positive lifestyle changes to enhance future health was emphasized.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115vZyd6]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Clinical management during menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) — For women with persistent unscheduled bleeding while taking MHT, we recommend evaluation to rule out pelvic pathology, most importantly, endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, and we recommend informing women about the possible increased risk of breast cancer during and after discontinuing EPT while emphasizing adherence to age-appropriate breast cancer screening. Regular clinical follow-up, initially, within 1 to 3 months after starting MHT, and then every 6 to 12 months, allows monitoring of efficacy and side effects and treatment adjustments as needed.

### The menopause transition [^112uoGsx]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

The menopause transition is a period of life during which a series of dynamic changes in physiology are taking place. There seems to be a transient increase in symptoms of many types, which are occasionally severe. There is a disproportionate burden of morbidity that seems to accrue to women of high body mass index and low socioeconomic status. Moreover, there are ethnic differences in hormones and symptoms that may reflect either basic biologic variation in hormone receptors and actions or the different social milieu that women in different ethnic groups experience. Current medical management of the perimenopause should include screen-ing for general health maintenance, avoidance of weight gain, and a holistic approach to symptoms.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^113fU5gr]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

The objective of this document is to generate a practice guideline for the management and treatment of symptoms of the menopause.

Participants

The Treatment of Symptoms of the Menopause Task Force included six experts, a methodologist, and a medical writer, all appointed by The Endocrine Society.

Evidence

The Task Force developed this evidenced-based guideline using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system to describe the strength of recommendations and the quality of evidence. The Task Force commissioned three systematic reviews of published data and considered several other existing meta-analyses and trials.

Consensus Process

Multiple e-mail communications, conference calls, and one face-to-face meeting determined consensus. Committees of The Endocrine Society, representatives from endorsing societies, and members of The Endocrine Society reviewed and commented on the drafts of the guidelines. The Australasian Menopause Society, the British Menopause Society, European Menopause and Andropause Society, the European Society of Endocrinology, and the International Menopause Society (co-sponsors of the guideline) reviewed and commented on the draft.

Conclusions

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms and other symptoms of the climacteric. Benefits may exceed risks for the majority of symptomatic postmenopausal women who are under age 60 or under 10 years since the onset of menopause. Health care professionals should individualize therapy based on clinical factors and patient preference. They should screen women before initiating MHT for cardiovascular and breast cancer risk and recommend the most appropriate therapy depending on risk/benefit considerations. Current evidence does not justify the use of MHT to prevent coronary heart disease, breast cancer, or dementia. Other options are available for those with vasomotor symptoms who prefer not to use MHT or who have contraindications because these patients should not use MHT. Low-dose vaginal estrogen and ospemifene provide effective therapy for the genitourinary syndrome of menopause, and vaginal moisturizers and lubricants are available for those not choosing hormonal therapy. All postmenopausal women should embrace appropriate lifestyle measures.

### The 2012 hormone therapy position statement of: the North American Menopause Society [^114YryjJ]. Menopause (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

This position statement aimed to update the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in 2010 regarding recommendations for hormone therapy (HT) for postmenopausal women. This updated position statement further distinguishes the emerging differences in the therapeutic benefit-risk ratio between estrogen therapy (ET) and combined estrogen-progestogen therapy (EPT) at various ages and time intervals since menopause onset.

Methods

An Advisory Panel of expert clinicians and researchers in the field of women's health was enlisted to review the 2010 NAMS position statement, evaluate new evidence, and reach consensus on recommendations. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees as an official NAMS position statement.

Results

Current evidence supports the use of HT for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women when the balance of potential benefits and risks is favorable for the individual woman. This position statement reviews the effects of ET and EPT on many aspects of women's health and recognizes the greater safety profile associated with ET.

Conclusions

Recent data support the initiation of HT around the time of menopause to treat menopause-related symptoms and to prevent osteoporosis in women at high risk of fracture. The more favorable benefit-risk ratio for ET allows more flexibility in extending the duration of use compared with EPT, where the earlier appearance of increased breast cancer risk precludes a recommendation for use beyond 3 to 5 years.

### "Extracts from "Clinical evidence": menopausal symptoms [^113H8w8J]. BMJ (2000). Excellent credibility.

Definition

Menopause begins one year after the last menstrual period. Symptoms often begin in the perimenopausal years. INCIDENCE/PREVALENCE: In the United Kingdom the mean age for the menopause is 50 years 9 months. The median onset of the perimenopause is between 45.5 and 47.5 years. One Scottish survey (of 6096 women aged 45 to 54 years) found that 84% had experienced at least one of the classic menopausal symptoms, with 45% finding one or more symptoms a problem. AETIOLOGY/RISK FACTORS: Urogenital symptoms of menopause are caused by decreased oestrogen concentrations, but the cause of vasomotor symptoms and psychological effects is complex and remains unclear.

Prognosis

Menopause is a physiological event. Its timing may be genetically determined. Although endocrine changes are permanent, menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes, which are experienced by about 70% of women, usually resolve with time. However, some symptoms, such as genital atrophy, may remain the same or worsen.

Aims

To reduce or prevent menopausal symptoms, and to improve quality of life with minimum adverse effects.

Outcomes

Frequency and severity of vasomotor, urogenital, and psychological symptoms; quality of life.

Methods

Clinical Evidence search and appraisal December 1999. We included only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and systematic reviews that met Clinical Evidence quality criteria.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^116fv8Zt]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Menopause diagnosis and definitions — In a woman with an intact uterus, menopause is a clinical diagnosis based upon cessation of menses for at least 12 months, and sex steroids, gonadotropins, inhibin B, or anti-Mullerian hormone measurements do not further inform the diagnosis, do not indicate precisely when the final menstrual period will occur, and will not influence management unless a woman is seeking fertility. Table definitions specify that spontaneous menopause occurs at an average age of 51 y, early menopause is cessation of ovarian function between ages 40 and 45, and POI is loss of ovarian function before the age of 40 y with the prevalence of POI is approximately 1%.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112VASo5]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Menopausal symptoms and ET/MHT — clinical background: VMS, hot flashes, and night sweats, are the hallmarks of menopause, although not all women experience these symptoms. Symptoms frequently start in the years before the final menstrual period and can last, with unpredictable duration, from a few years to more than 13 years. ET has long been recognized as the most effective treatment for the relief of bothersome vasomotor and vaginal symptoms associated with menopause. During ensuing years, a consensus arose that most healthy symptomatic women, without contraindications and closer to the time of menopause (< 10 y after menopause onset or age < 60 y), were appropriate candidates for MHT for symptom relief, and post hoc WHI analyses and observational data suggest that benefits exceed risks in most of these women.

### The prevalence and patterns of menopausal symptoms in women living with HIV [^115ty8Yn]. AIDS and Behavior (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

In 2019, over 30,000 women living with HIV attended for HIV care in the UK, one in three (36.2%) of whom were aged over 50. Successes in lifelong antiretroviral treatment (ART) mean that women with HIV now have a similar life expectancy to their HIV-negative counterparts. Therefore, this population is now increasingly experiencing age-related conditions including menopause.

Oestrogen depletion marks the beginning of the menopause transition and manifests in a range of symptoms, impacting physical and psychological well-being. It is estimated that 85% of women experience at least one symptom during the peri-menopause phase, which can persist post-menopausally. The most prevalent symptoms reported are vasomotor (such as hot flashes and night sweats), however urogenital symptoms (including vaginal dryness, urinary symptoms and sexual dysfunction), mood changes, sleep disturbance, cognitive changes and joint pain can also be present.

As greater numbers of women with HIV reach midlife, evidence has accrued to suggest a high prevalence of menopausal symptoms in this population, with these symptoms potentially being more severe than in the general population. It is essential that women with HIV are aware of menopause and its associated symptoms. This is particularly important in the context of a clinical condition associated with multi-morbidity. The potential overlap of numerous symptoms (including hot flashes/night sweats, exhaustion, sleep problems and depression) related to both HIV and/or menopause can make it hard for women and their healthcare providers to identify aetiology and implement appropriate management plans.

To date, there has been limited information about women ageing with HIV, with existing published descriptive data primarily relating to age at menopause or prevalence of menopausal symptoms. Understanding which symptoms cluster together, and their trajectory over the menopause transition, may provide insights into potential underlying causes and highlight how and when to screen and offer appropriate support to maintain the health and quality of life of women with HIV. The Positive tRansItions through the MEnopause (PRIME) Study was designed to explore menopause amongst women living with HIV in England aged 45–60 years. In this analysis, we use PRIME study data to describe the prevalence of menopausal symptoms and describe which symptoms commonly co-occur amongst pre-, peri- and post-menopausal women in a large, representative sample of women living with HIV.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^115TEqN9]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — treatment of menopausal symptoms states that menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) is the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms and other symptoms of the climacteric, and that benefits clearly exceed risks for the majority of symptomatic postmenopausal women who are under age 60 or under 10 years since the onset of menopause. Health care professionals should individualize therapy based on clinical factors and patient preference, and they should screen women before initiating MHT for cardiovascular and breast cancer risk and recommend the most appropriate therapy depending on risk/benefit considerations. Current evidence does not justify the use of MHT to prevent coronary heart disease, breast cancer, or dementia. For those with vasomotor symptoms who prefer not to use MHT or who have contraindications — because these patients should not use MHT — other options are available; for the genitourinary syndrome of menopause, low-dose vaginal estrogen and ospemifene provide effective therapy, and vaginal moisturizers and lubricants are available for those not choosing hormonal therapy. All postmenopausal women should embrace appropriate lifestyle measures.

### The 2017 hormone therapy position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^112UbdZa]. Menopause (2017). Low credibility.

The 2017 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) updates the 2012 Hormone Therapy Position Statement of The North American Menopause Society and identifies future research needs. An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health and menopause was recruited by NAMS to review the 2012 Position Statement, evaluate new literature, assess the evidence, and reach consensus on recommendations, using the level of evidence to identify the strength of recommendations and the quality of the evidence. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees. Hormone therapy (HT) remains the most effective treatment for vasomotor symptoms (VMS) and the genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) and has been shown to prevent bone loss and fracture. The risks of HT differ depending on type, dose, duration of use, route of administration, timing of initiation, and whether a progestogen is used. Treatment should be individualized to identify the most appropriate HT type, dose, formulation, route of administration, and duration of use, using the best available evidence to maximize benefits and minimize risks, with periodic reevaluation of the benefits and risks of continuing or discontinuing HT. For women aged younger than 60 years or who are within 10 years of menopause onset and have no contraindications, the benefit-risk ratio is most favorable for treatment of bothersome VMS and for those at elevated risk for bone loss or fracture. For women who initiate HT more than 10 or 20 years from menopause onset or are aged 60 years or older, the benefit-risk ratio appears less favorable because of the greater absolute risks of coronary heart disease, stroke, venous thromboembolism, and dementia. Longer durations of therapy should be for documented indications such as persistent VMS or bone loss, with shared decision making and periodic reevaluation. For bothersome GSM symptoms not relieved with over-the-counter therapies and without indications for use of systemic HT, low-dose vaginal estrogen therapy or other therapies are recommended. This NAMS position statement has been endorsed by Academy of Women's Health, American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American Association of Nurse Practitioners, American Medical Women's Association, American Society for Reproductive Medicine, Asociación Mexicana para el Estudio del Climaterio, Association of Reproductive Health Professionals, Australasian Menopause Society, Chinese Menopause Society, Colegio Mexicano de Especialistas en Ginecologia y Obstetricia, Czech Menopause and Andropause Society, Dominican Menopause Society, European Menopause and Andropause Society, German Menopause Society, Groupe d'études de la ménopause et du vieillissement Hormonal, HealthyWomen, Indian Menopause Society, International Menopause Society, International Osteoporosis Foundation, International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health, Israeli Menopause Society, Japan Society of Menopause and Women's Health, Korean Society of Menopause, Menopause Research Society of Singapore, National Association of Nurse Practitioners in Women's Health, SOBRAC and FEBRASGO, SIGMA Canadian Menopause Society, Società Italiana della Menopausa, Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada, South African Menopause Society, Taiwanese Menopause Society, and the Thai Menopause Society.

### Symptom experience during the late reproductive stage and the menopausal transition: observations from the women living better survey [^117YEUGC]. Menopause (2021). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Many women experience symptoms similar to those reported during the MT before cycle irregularity of a week or more and most do not expect these changes until the age of 50 years or later. Anticipatory guidance for women, education for the clinicians who care for them, as well as ongoing research about the epidemiology, physiology and management of LRS symptoms warrant increased attention. Further enhancement of the STRAW framework will benefit from consideration of recent evidence of women's LRS experience.

### Optimising health after early menopause [^1165eqt2]. Lancet (2024). Excellent credibility.

The typical age at menopause is 50–51 years in high-income countries. However, early menopause is common, with around 8% of women in high-income countries and 12% of women globally experiencing menopause between the ages of 40 years and 44 years. Menopause before age 40 years (premature ovarian insufficiency) affects an additional 2–4% of women. Both early menopause and premature ovarian insufficiency can herald an increased risk of chronic disease, including osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. People who enter menopause at younger ages might also experience distress and feel less supported than those who reach menopause at the average age. Clinical practice guidelines are available for the diagnosis and management of premature ovarian insufficiency, but there is a gap in clinical guidance for early menopause. We argue that instead of distinct age thresholds being applied, early menopause should be seen on a spectrum between premature ovarian insufficiency and menopause at the average age. This Series paper presents evidence for the short-term and long-term consequences of early menopause. We offer a practical framework for clinicians to guide diagnosis and management of early menopause, which considers the nature and severity of symptoms, age and medical history, and the individual's wishes and priorities to optimise their quality of life and short-term and long-term health. We conclude with recommendations for future research to address key gaps in the current evidence.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^112Gs6o3]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) evidence and selection — In postmenopausal women, estrogen therapy (ET) improves menopause-associated symptoms and "reduces menopause-related bone loss, lowers the risk of fragility fractures in older women, and reduces the incidence of self-reported diabetes", and combined estrogen plus progestogen therapy (EPT) "reduced the risk of colorectal cancer and, in cumulative follow-up of the WHI, endometrial cancer". MHT "is not appropriate for all symptomatic menopausal women", and "there are no commonly recognized lists of absolute or relative contraindications to MHT as published in professional society guidelines", although "US product labeling (regulated by the FDA) does include contraindications to MHT… [and] caution is also advised for women with certain additional medical conditions". Women with conditions precluding MHT, those "who are unwilling to take MHT, or at substantial risk for breast cancer or CVD, can consider nonhormonal options for symptom relief".

### A review of transdermal nonpatch estrogen therapy for the management of menopausal symptoms [^116kZt3P]. Journal of Women's Health (2010). Low credibility.

During the transition into menopause, women may experience a wide range of symptoms that negatively impact quality of life. The vasomotor symptoms (VMS) of hot flushes and night sweats are common and vary widely in frequency and severity. The treatment of menopause-associated VMS is a frequently encountered clinical challenge, with the goal of tailoring treatment for each individual woman's needs. Estrogen therapy is the most effective treatment for menopausal VMS. Current guidelines suggest that estrogen therapy be prescribed at the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration of time. Transdermal estrogen therapy has dominated the menopause prescribing practice in Europe for decades; however, in the United States, oral estrogen therapy is most commonly prescribed. Transdermal estrogen therapy can be prescribed at considerably lower doses than oral therapy yet has similar efficacy on the symptoms of menopause. Emerging research demonstrates transdermal estrogen, particularly 17beta-estradiol, may have the potential for fewer health risks than oral estrogen therapy. This review article discusses the spectrum of menopausal symptoms, addresses prevailing issues in the treatment of menopause, elaborates on the risks and benefits of oral and transdermal hormone therapies, and focuses on five nonpatch transdermal estradiol therapies currently available in the United States.

### Menopause preparedness: perspectives for patient, provider, and policymaker consideration [^114rCr4C]. Menopause (2021). Medium credibility.

The menopause transition is characterized by fluctuations and subsequent reduced production of the ovarian hormones estrogen and progesterone and the cessation of a woman's menstrual cycle. Defined as 12 months after the last period, the onset of the postmenopause typically occurs in a woman's 40s or 50s, with the average age of the final menstrual period in the United States being 51 years. An estimated 6,000 women in the United States reach menopause daily. Some individuals may experience early menopause before the age of 40 years due to certain illnesses and conditions that affect ovarian function, such as primary ovarian insufficiency and surgical removal of the ovaries, or other risk factors, including family history, smoking, and chemotherapy.

For many individuals, the hormonal changes that take place during perimenopause, the years leading up to menopause, are associated with physical and psychological symptoms such as irregular menstrual cycles, hot flashes, vaginal dryness, mood fluctuations, sleep disruptions, and cognitive challenges. Symptoms vary widely between individuals and are commonly misdiagnosed, resulting in delays in appropriate management of symptoms and disruption of day-to-day activities. Accumulating science about the menopause transition has revealed that this period can last up to 20 years. Some postmenopausal women are also at heightened risk for serious health conditions that increase after the final menstrual period, such as cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, and diabetes. Furthermore, because of increases in life expectancy, a woman's postmenopause phase may comprise up to 40% of her life. If an individual is not adequately prepared and/or symptoms are not well-managed, the menopause transition has the potential to exacerbate conditions that impair quality of life and life expectancy.

Endocrine Society clinical practice guideline — diagnosis of menopause: We suggest diagnosing menopause based on the clinical criteria of the menstrual cycle. If establishing a diagnosis of menopause is necessary for patient management in women having undergone a hysterectomy without bilateral oophorectomy or presenting with a menstrual history that is inadequate to ascertain menopausal status, we suggest making a presumptive diagnosis of menopause based on the presence of VMS and, when indicated, laboratory testing that includes replicate measures of FSH and serum estradiol. Table 1 summarizes other etiologies of secondary amenorrhea to be considered in the differential diagnosis.

### A core outcome set for vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause: the COMMA (core outcomes in menopause) global initiative [^1117MAie]. Menopause (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

Vasomotor symptoms (VMS) (hot flashes and night sweats) affect most women over the menopause transition. Comparing the safety and effectiveness of treatments for vasomotor symptoms is limited by the use of inconsistent outcome measures, and uncertainty as to which outcomes are most important to symptomatic women. To address this, we have developed a Core Outcome Set (COS) for use in clinical trials of treatments for VMS.

Methods

We systematically reviewed the primary outcomes measured in randomized controlled trials of treatments for VMS. These were refined and entered into a two-round modified Delphi survey completed by clinicians, researchers, and postmenopausal women between November 2019 and March 2020. Outcomes were scored on a nine-point scale from "not important" to "critically important". Two international consensus meetings were held to finalize the COS.

Results

Based on the systematic review, 13 separate outcomes were included in the Delphi process. This was completed by 227 participants of whom 58% were postmenopausal women, 34% clinicians, and 8% researchers. Predefined thresholds were applied to categorize importance scores obtained during Round 2 of the Delphi survey. These informed discussions at the consensus meetings which were attended by 56 participants from 28 countries. The final COS includes six outcomes: 1) frequency of VMS, 2) severity of VMS, 3) distress, bother or interference caused by VMS, 4) impact on sleep, 5) satisfaction with treatment, and 6) side-effects of treatment.

Conclusion

Implementation of this COS will: better enable research studies to accurately reflect the joint priorities of postmenopausal women, clinicians and researchers, standardize outcome reporting, and facilitate combining and comparing results from different studies, and ultimately improve outcomes for women with bothersome VMS.

### Can depression be a menopause-associated risk? [^111pUBBb]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Robust epidemiologic evidence supports the existence of a 'window of vulnerability' for the occurrence of depression (new onset or recurrent) during the menopausal transition and early postmenopausal years. Similar to that observed in other periods in life, antidepressants and psychotherapies continue to be the treatments of choice for depression occurring in midlife women. Nonetheless, accumulated preclinical and clinical data support the benefits of estrogen-based therapies to improve mood and other menopause-related symptoms during this critical window. As such, estrogen should be considered part of the treatment armamentarium for depression, along with other well established benefits (for example, for vasomotor, sexual and other menopause-related complaints). Lastly, the use of specific screening and diagnostic tools for depression in women should help physicians and health professionals to improve early detection and clinical management. Ultimately, treatment strategies should be tailored and incorporate all the resources available to reduce the significant burden and functional impairment associated with depression in women undergoing menopause.

### Efficacy and safety of fezolinetant for moderate-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause in individuals unsuitable for hormone therapy: phase 3b randomised controlled trial [^115q1RCS]. BMJ (2024). Excellent credibility.

Introduction

Vasomotor symptoms, comprising hot flushes and night sweats, are the most common and bothersome symptoms associated with menopause. Up to 80% of women experience vasomotor symptoms during menopause. Moderate-severe symptoms occur in 11–46% of women older than 40 years, with a median total duration around 7.4 years, whereas the severity of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause varies throughout the course of menopause and among women.

Although vasomotor symptoms are common and often severe enough to warrant medical treatment, approved and effective non-hormonal treatments are limited. Hormone therapy is effective but not appropriate for everyone. Treatment is contraindicated in women with a history of breast cancer, uterine cancer, active liver disease, or thromboembolic diseases, and caution is advised in those with comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and raised triglyceride levels. Hormone therapy is not suitable for many women, and some choose not to use it.

### Can depression be a menopause-associated risk? [^113g5aFo]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Introduction

Over the past few decades, growing epidemiological and clinical data support the notion that some, but not all, women may be at a heightened risk for psychiatric morbidity (for example, mood and anxiety symptoms, cognitive complaints) during periods in life that are associated with reproductive cycle events such as the postpartum period and the menopausal transition. These periods are not only marked by extreme hormone variations but may also be accompanied by the occurrence of significant life stressors and changes in personal, family, and professional responsibilities. The complexity of the so-called female-specific 'windows of vulnerability' certainly poses a particular challenge to physicians and other professionals dedicated to women's health issues across the life span.

Among these female-specific 'windows of vulnerability', the menopausal transition constitutes a complex example: this transition is marked by progressive, dynamic changes in sex hormones and reproductive function. At the same time, these changes overlap with the aging process per se, and with modifications in metabolism, sexuality, lifestyle behaviors and overall health. During this period in life, some individuals may seek medical treatment for a constellation of symptoms including vasomotor complaints (VMS; that is, hot flashes, night sweats), aches and stiff joints, trouble sleeping, and lack of energy. Others, on a more preventative approach, will inquire about different strategies (for example, hormonal, non-hormonal, 'natural' remedies) to promote a 'healthier' transition into postmenopausal years. Overall, diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to symptomatic women during the menopausal transition and postmenopausal years are, or should be, multifaceted and multidisciplinary in nature (Figure 1).

Regarding medical management for menopause, more specifically with respect to management of vasomotor symptoms, hormonal therapy, AACE 2011 guidelines recommend to consider initiating menopausal hormone therapy during the perimenopause and early menopause for menopausal symptoms. Consider initiating menopausal hormone therapy for severe menopausal symptoms in selected postmenopausal patients, on the basis of an individually determined benefit-versus-risk profile.

### The AUA / SUFU / AUGS guideline on genitourinary syndrome of menopause [^113zpxEK]. The Journal of Urology (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) describes the symptoms and physical changes that result from declining estrogen and androgen concentrations in the genitourinary tract during the menopausal transition. There has not been a consensus reached about the number or type of symptoms needed to diagnose GSM, and the associated urinary symptoms are also linked with other common urologic conditions (e.g., overactive bladder) in older patients. This guideline provides information to clinicians regarding identification, diagnosis, counseling, and treatment for patients with GSM to optimize symptom control and quality of life while minimizing adverse events (AEs).

Methods

The systematic review utilized in the creation of this guideline is based on research conducted by the Minnesota Evidence-based Practice Center (EPC) under contract to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and funded by the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI). The EPC extracted and synthesized effectiveness and/or harms outcomes from 68 publications. An additional 66 publications evaluating 46 non-hormonal interventions, were described in an evidence map.

Results

Clinicians diagnose GSM based on symptoms, with or without related physical findings, and after ruling out other etiologies or co-occurring pathologies. There is a large body of evidence examining the use of hormonal and non-hormonal treatment options to manage the symptoms of GSM; however, the local low-dose vaginal estrogen has the most robust evidence base.

Conclusion

The strategies defined in this document were derived from evidence-based and consensus-based processes. Given that there is insufficient information to recommend one hormonal therapy over another, this guideline is not meant to support a stepwise progression through different hormonal approaches. The clinician should make treatment decisions in the context of shared decision-making considering patient goals and preferences, using the evidence of efficacy and AEs of each possible intervention as a guide.

### Menopausal transition, mood, and cognition: an integrated view to close the gaps [^114WzH2L]. Menopause (2010). Low credibility.

Epidemiological and clinic data support the notion that some women may be at higher risk for developing mood and anxiety symptoms and cognitive complaints during certain periods in life that are marked by intense hormone variations and psychosocial stressors. The complexity of the so-called windows of vulnerability poses a particular challenge to professionals involved in the care of female patients. Menopausal transition is perhaps a paramount example; the process itself is marked by progressive, dynamic changes in hormone levels and reproductive function that interact with the aging process, changes in metabolism, sexuality, lifestyle behaviors, and overall health. The putative compounded burden of health challenges associated with this transition has become a main focus of attention of physicians and researchers who aim to identify preventive and/or early intervention strategies to promote healthy aging in midlife women. Recent studies have provided further evidence that the menopausal transition may be not only a window of vulnerability for depression and cognitive impairment but also a critical "window of opportunity" for the success of hormone-based treatments. The need for further investigation and better understanding of common underlying mechanisms seems intuitive. An ultimate goal could include preventive strategies for women presenting with various risk factors for cardiovascular, cognitive, and mood disorders as well as treatments that could be tailored to multiple symptom domains during the menopausal transition.

### Perimenopause: from research to practice [^1176wCPP]. Journal of Women's Health (2016). Low credibility.

The menopausal transition, or perimenopause, is associated with profound reproductive and hormonal changes. These changes have been well chronicled and matched with concomitant symptoms. The pattern of appearance of menopausal symptoms and their natural history have become increasingly clear thanks to the conduct of several long-term, longitudinal cohort studies that have examined many aspects of women's biology and psychology through this time of life. Menopausal symptoms are highly prevalent; they are sufficiently bothersome to drive almost 90% of women to seek out their healthcare provider for advice on how to cope. (1) The classic symptom of menopause is the hot flash, which is experienced by most women, and is moderately to severely problematic for about 1/3 of women. While most women will have an experience of hot flashes limited to just a year or two, others will experience them for a decade or more, and a small proportion of women will never be free of them. Poor sleep becomes more common in perimenopausal women not only in association with the menopausal transition but also in relation to aging. Depressed mood and increased anxiety also increase during the transition, with an abrupt rise in prevalence as women approach the later stages of the menopausal transition and have longer bouts of amenorrhea. These common symptoms often interact with one another such that depressed women tend to experience worse hot flashes along with worse sleep. As women enter the latter stages of the transition, vaginal dryness and dyspareunia also become more likely, affecting about 1/3 of the population. Unlike hot flashes, mood issues, and sleep, vaginal symptoms will not go away without treatment. Clinical approaches to these problems often involve hormone therapy, which can be safely given to most perimenopausal women on a short-term basis. Therapeutic strategies that are nonhormonal and behavioral can also be deployed.

Regarding medical management for menopause, more specifically with respect to management of vasomotor symptoms, hormonal therapy, ACOG 2014 guidelines recommend to individualize care, given the variable response to hormone therapy and the associated risks, and treat patients with the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration needed to relieve vasomotor symptoms.

### Depression during and after the perimenopause: impact of hormones, genetics, and environmental determinants of disease [^115tAd7N]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Vulnerability to depression is increased across the menopause transition and in the early years after the final menstrual period. Clinicians should systematically screen women in this age group; if depressive symptoms or disorder are present, treatment of depression should be initiated. Potential treatments include antidepressants for moderate to severe symptoms, psychotherapy to target psychological and interpersonal factors, and hormone therapy for women with first-onset major depressive disorder or elevated depressive symptoms and at low risk for adverse effects. Behavioral interventions can improve physical activity and sleep patterns.

### Mood disorders in midlife women: understanding the critical window and its clinical implications [^111LT9Ne]. Menopause (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Menopausal transition and early postmenopausal years have been described as a "window of vulnerability" for the development of depressive symptoms or depression (new or recurrent) in some women. This article aims to review contributing factors to the emergence of menopause-related depression, some of the key challenges to its proper identification and management, and evidence on effective treatment strategies.

Methods

A body of evidence (animal data, epidemiologic studies, and clinical studies) was reviewed to disentangle some of the complex interactions between changes in sex hormones and reproductive function, physical health, and mood in midlife women. Special focus was given to the window of vulnerability framework.

Results

Despite evidence of a critical window for new onset of depression, a prior depressive episode (particularly if related to reproductive events) remains the strongest predictor of mood symptoms or depression during midlife years. Vasomotor symptoms, anxiety, and other health-related issues also modulate the risk for depression. Mechanistically, estrogen plays an important role in mood and cognitive regulation. Transdermal estradiol, as well as serotonergic and noradrenergic antidepressants, have shown efficacy in the management of depression in this population. Other evidence-based treatment options (hormonal, pharmacologic, and behavioral) are available to clinicians and health professionals.

Conclusions

A more comprehensive diagnostic approach should be used in symptomatic midlife women. Ultimately, researchers hope to develop preventive strategies and treatments that could be tailored to multiple symptom domains and improve overall functioning.

### Health symptoms during midlife in relation to menopausal transition: British prospective cohort study [^115brjLd]. BMJ (2012). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To characterise symptoms experienced by women during the transition into natural menopause, to classify women into distinct symptom profiles or trajectories, and to relate these profiles to sociodemographic factors and health behaviours.

Design

Nationally representative cohort study.

Setting

England, Scotland, and Wales.

Participants

695 women followed-up since birth in 1946 and annually from age 47 to 54 who experienced natural menopause and reported on 20 common health symptoms.

Main Outcome Measure

Longitudinal profiles for reported bothersome symptoms.

Results

Of 20 individual symptoms, 18 formed into four stable symptom groups: psychological, somatic, vasomotor, and sexual discomfort. Using latent class analyses, all except the somatic group of symptoms showed a clear relation with the timing of menopause for some women. A small proportion of women (10%, n = 63) had a severe psychological symptom profile that peaked at or in the year after menopause. For vasomotor symptoms, 14% of women (n = 83) had the early severe profile that also peaked around early postmenopause and then declined noticeably; 11% (n = 67) had the late severe profile of bothersome symptoms that increased rapidly in perimenopause and remained high for four years or more after menopause. Women were less likely to have a profile for severe vasomotor symptoms if they were from a non-manual social class (odds ratio 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.57 to 1.01) or had degree level qualifications (0.37, 0.18 to 0.77). The 14% of women (n = 85) who had the late severe profile for sexual discomfort showed a similar increase in symptoms until menopause, with symptoms persisting after menopause. Married women were more likely to have the late severe or late moderate profile than women of other marital status (2.40, 1.30 to 4.41). Four profiles each were identified for somatic symptoms (mild, moderate, severe, and very severe), although these did not vary by chronological age or age at menopause.

Conclusion

Profiles for psychological, vasomotor, and sexual discomfort symptoms relative to age at menopause could help health professionals to tailor their advice for women with natural menopause.

### Menopausal symptoms and their management [^113Ta1xv]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2015). Low credibility.

The menopause transition is associated with various symptoms, which can interact to produce morbidity. Vasomotor symptoms are the most commonly reported, but vaginal dryness/dyspareunia, sleep difficulties and adverse mood changes have all been shown to worsen as women approach menopause. For postmenopausal women changes in cognition are more likely to be related to aging and not to hormones. This article reviews the symptoms of hot flashes (vasomotor symptoms), vaginal dryness/dyspareunia, adverse mood, poor sleep/insomnia, and cognitive complaints, describing their epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment. This article thus reviews the epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of these common menopausal symptoms.

### Genitourinary symptoms in the menopausal transition [^111DFX9a]. The American Journal of Medicine (2005). Low credibility.

Irregular uterine bleeding is a common symptom among women in the menopausal transition. Women commonly transition from having regular cycles to having irregular cycles before the final menstrual period. In late perimenopause, anovulation becomes more common, leading to skipped menstrual cycles. Low-dose oral contraceptive pills are effective in decreasing the amount of menstrual blood loss and improving menstrual cycle regularity. It is unclear whether menorrhagia is associated with normal perimenopausal hormonal changes. Studies to date have failed to correlate menorrhagia with hormonal levels and pathology within the uterus. Because of the common association between uterine pathology and menorrhagia, this is an important area for future studies. Vaginal dryness is a common symptom, particularly in late perimenopause. The association between vaginal dryness and low estrogen levels is clear. Estrogen-based hormone replacement therapy is effective in treating this symptom. Locally released estrogen therapy may be preferred over systemic therapy because of lower systemic estradiol levels, reduced side effects, and high efficacy. The long-term safety of these products, particularly in women with a history of breast cancer, requires more study. The prevalence of incontinence increases as women age, but it is unclear whether the menopausal transition is an independent risk factor. Incontinence is a frequent complaint among women in the menopausal transition. In postmenopausal women, hormone therapy (HT) appears to be ineffective in preventing or improving the symptoms of incontinence. Further study of HT, including locally applied estrogens for the common symptom of incontinence, are needed in women in the menopausal transition.

### Sleep disturbance associated with the menopause [^112xyLQA]. Menopause (2024). Medium credibility.

Importance and Objectives

Sleep disturbance is one of the most common and debilitating symptoms experienced by women during the menopause transition. However, there are currently no therapies specifically approved for sleep disturbance associated with the menopause. Here, we consider how to characterize sleep disturbance associated with the menopause and discuss its etiology, including the latest advances in our understanding of the neuronal circuits that regulate reproduction, body temperature, sleep, and mood; and reflect on its impact on women's health and well-being. We also examine the current treatment landscape and look to the future of treatment for this condition.

Methods

We conducted a review of the literature and combined this with discussion with experts in the fields of sleep and menopause as well as experiences from our own clinical practices.

Discussion and Conclusions

Sleep disturbance associated with the menopause is characterized by frequent night-time awakenings and increased awake time after sleep onset. Its impacts are wide-ranging, negatively affecting health as well as personal and social relationships, productivity, and work performance. There is currently an unmet need for effective, safe, and well-tolerated treatments to address this important symptom, and wider recognition of the association between sleep disturbances and the menopause is needed. Sleep disturbances associated with the menopause can result from hormone changes as well as vasomotor and mood symptoms. Growing research has contributed to our knowledge of the role of hypothalamic estrogen-sensitive kisspeptin/neurokinin B/dynorphin neurons. These neurons are thought to integrate the gonadotropin-releasing hormone pathway and the pathways responsible for the homeostatic control of body temperature and the circadian regulation of sleep-wake cycles. Understanding these neurons offers the potential to create treatments that target a key cause of sleep disturbance associated with the menopause. Further research to understand their etiology and characterize the neuronal circuits responsible could benefit the development of these targeted treatment approaches.

### The many menopauses: searching the cognitive research literature for menopause types [^112ZEt6h]. Menopause (2019). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

There is no single pathway to the end of menses. Menstruation ceases for different reasons, in different ways, at different time points in the lifespan, with different symptom experiences and health risks. Differentiating between menopausal types in research is an important step toward clarifying the uniqueness of menopause experience for each woman. Acknowledging menopausal types in design and analysis is an important next step for clinical research. The absence of menopausal differentiation in one year of research alone suggests that menopause remains for many a monolithic and uniform process. When taking the many menopauses into account, differences in memory and cognitive outcomes are seen for each type of menopause. Explicitly acknowledging the many menopauses will allow for more rigorous clinical research and the development of clinical guidelines that are applicable to each type of menopause in all women.

### Management of menopausal symptoms: a review [^1149FNSf]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on menopause:

- Definition: Menopause is defined as the natural biological process in women that signifies the permanent end of menstruation and fertility.
- Pathophysiology: The pathophysiology of menopause is primarily related to the depletion of ovarian follicles, which leads to decreased production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone. This hormonal change triggers the various symptoms associated with menopause.
- Epidemiology: The prevalence of menopause-related vasomotor symptoms differs across geographic regions: estimated at 46% in North America, 45–69% in Latin America, 74% in Europe, and 22–63% in Asia.
- Risk factors: Several risk factors are associated with more severe menopausal symptoms. These include a history of depression, certain lifestyle factors such as smoking and obesity, and undergoing premature or surgical menopause.
- Disease course: Menopause is characterized by a variety of clinical manifestations. The most common symptoms include vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats, genitourinary symptoms like vaginal dryness and dyspareunia, and mood changes.
- Prognosis and risk of recurrence: The prognosis of menopause is generally favorable, the symptoms eventually subside without intervention.

### Estrogen and progestogen use in postmenopausal women: July 2008 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^112H6TEs]. Menopause (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

To update for both clinicians and the lay public the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in March 2007 regarding its recommendations for menopausal hormone therapy (HT) for postmenopausal women, with consideration for the therapeutic benefit-risk ratio at various times through menopause and beyond.

Design

An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health was enlisted to review the March 2007 NAMS position statement, evaluate new evidence through an evidence-based analysis, and reach consensus on recommendations. The Panel's recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees as an official NAMS position statement. The document was provided to other interested organizations to seek their endorsement.

Results

Current evidence supports a consensus regarding the role of HT in postmenopausal women, when potential therapeutic benefits and risks around the time of menopause are considered. This paper lists all these areas along with explanatory comments. Conclusions that vary from the 2007 position statement are highlighted. Addenda include a discussion of risk concepts, a new component not included in the 2007 paper, and a recommended list of areas for future HT research. A suggested reading list of key references is also provided.

Conclusions

Recent data support the initiation of HT around the time of menopause to treat menopause-related symptoms; to treat or reduce the risk of certain disorders, such as osteoporosis or fractures in select postmenopausal women; or both. The benefit-risk ratio for menopausal HT is favorable close to menopause but decreases with aging and with time since menopause in previously untreated women.

### The prevalence and patterns of menopausal symptoms in women living with HIV [^116oFS9n]. AIDS and Behavior (2022). Medium credibility.

Increasing numbers of women with HIV are experiencing menopause. We use data from a large, representative sample of women with HIV to describe the prevalence and clustering of menopausal symptoms amongst pre-, peri- and post-menopausal women using hierarchical agglomerative cluster analysis. Of the 709 women included, 21.6%, 44.9% and 33.6% were pre-, peri- and post-menopausal, respectively. Joint pain (66.4%) was the most commonly reported symptom, followed by hot flashes (63.0%), exhaustion (61.6%) and sleep problems (61.4%). All symptoms were reported more commonly by peri- and post-menopausal women compared to pre-menopausal women. Psychological symptoms and sleep problems clustered together at all menopausal stages. Somatic and urogenital symptom clusters emerged more distinctly at peri- and post-menopause. We recommend regular and proactive assessment of menopausal symptoms in midlife women with HIV, with an awareness of how particular patterns of symptoms may evolve over the menopausal transition.

### A systematic review and critical appraisal of menopause guidelines [^111tBShn]. BMJ Sexual & Reproductive Health (2024). High credibility.

Objective and Rationale

To identify and appraise current national and international clinical menopause guidance documents, and to extract and compare the recommendations of the most robust examples.

Design

Systematic review.

Data Sources

Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Web of Science ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES: Practice guidance documents for menopause published from 2015 until 20 July 2023. Quality was assessed by the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) instrument.

Results

Twenty-six guidance papers were identified. Of these, five clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) and one non-hormonal therapy position statement met AGREE II criteria of being at least of moderate quality. The five CPGs listed symptoms associated with the perimenopause and menopause to be vasomotor symptoms (VMS), disturbed sleep, musculoskeletal pain, decreased sexual function or desire, and mood disturbance (low mood, mood changes or depressive symptoms). Acknowledged potential long-term menopause consequences were urogenital atrophy, and increased risks of cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis. VMS and menopause-associated mood disturbance were the only consistent indications for systemic menopausal hormone therapy (MHT). Some CPGs supported MHT to prevent or treat osteoporosis, but specific guidance was lacking. None recommended MHT for cognitive symptoms or prevention of other chronic disease. Perimenopause-specific recommendations were scant. A neurokinin 3B antagonist, selective serotonin/norepinephrine (noradrenaline) reuptake inhibitors and gabapentin were recommended non-hormonal medications for VMS, and cognitive behavioural therapy and hypnosis were consistently considered as being of potential benefit.

Discussion

The highest quality CPGs consistently recommended MHT for VMS and menopause-associated mood disturbance, whereas clinical depression or cognitive symptoms, and cardiometabolic disease and dementia prevention were not treatment indications. Further research is needed to inform clinical recommendations for symptomatic perimenopausal women.

### Being in postmenopause may be associated with lower prevalence of COVID-19 symptoms among women over 45 years of age with and without HIV [^113XZyNx]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

Objective

Menopause is associated with COVID-19 severity among women without HIV (WWoH). Yet, little is known about menopause and COVID-19 among women with HIV (WWH).

Methods

We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of survey data collected in 2020–2022 from WWH and WWoH over 45 years of age enrolled in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study/Women's Interagency HIV Study Combined Cohort Study. Women were categorized as premenopausal (no report of menstrual irregularities), perimenopausal (menstruating, with irregularities or self-reported menopause), or postmenopausal (amenorrhea for at least 1 year). Women who reported a positive COVID-19 test in any setting were asked about COVID-19 symptoms. COVID-19 symptoms during the most recent confirmed infection were compared across HIV status and menopause stage.

Results

Among 1,244 eligible women (70% WWH), 15% were premenopausal, 9% were perimenopausal, and 76% were postmenopausal. Among 112 women with a prior positive COVID-19 test, HIV status was not associated with COVID-19 symptoms. We combined women across HIV status and compared symptoms during premenopause/perimenopause versus postmenopause. Having any COVID-19 symptom was more common among women in premenopause/perimenopause (89%) than in postmenopause (70%). Compared with women in postmenopause, women in premenopause/perimenopause had higher odds of reporting muscle aches, fatigue, and loss of smell/taste after controlling for HIV, age, race, and ethnicity. When examining premenopause and perimenopause separately and when using alternative criteria to define menopause stage in sensitivity analyses, aches, fatigue, and loss of smell/taste remained least common in postmenopause.

Conclusions

COVID-19 symptoms may be least prevalent in postmenopause and may overlap with menopause symptoms in WWH and WWoH.

### Management of genitourinary syndrome of menopause in women with or at high risk for breast cancer: consensus recommendations from the North American Menopause Society and the international society for the study of women's sexual health [^111778A2]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

The objective of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) and The International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health (ISSWSH) Expert Consensus Panel was to create a point of care algorithm for treating genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) in women with or at high risk for breast cancer. The consensus recommendations will assist healthcare providers in managing GSM with a goal of improving the care and quality of life for these women. The Expert Consensus Panel is comprised of a diverse group of 16 multidisciplinary experts well respected in their fields. The panelists individually conducted an evidence-based review of the literature in their respective areas of expertise. They then met to discuss the latest treatment options for genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) in survivors of breast cancer and review management strategies for GSM in women with or at high risk for breast cancer, using a modified Delphi method. This iterative process involved presentations summarizing the current literature, debate, and discussion of divergent opinions concerning GSM assessment and management, leading to the development of consensus recommendations for the clinician. Genitourinary syndrome of menopause is more prevalent in survivors of breast cancer, is commonly undiagnosed and untreated, and may have early onset because of cancer treatments or risk-reducing strategies. The paucity of evidence regarding the safety of vaginal hormone therapies in women with or at high risk for breast cancer has resulted in avoidance of treatment, potentially adversely affecting quality of life and intimate relationships. Factors influencing decision-making regarding treatment for GSM include breast cancer recurrence risk, severity of symptoms, response to prior therapies, and personal preference. We review current evidence for various pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapeutic modalities in women with a history of or at high risk for breast cancer and highlight the substantial gaps in the evidence for safe and effective therapies and the need for future research. Treatment of GSM is individualized, with nonhormone treatments generally being first line in this population. The use of local hormone therapies may be an option for some women who fail nonpharmacologic and nonhormone treatments after a discussion of risks and benefits and review with a woman's oncologist. We provide consensus recommendations for an approach to the management of GSM in specific patient populations, including women at high risk for breast cancer, women with estrogen-receptor positive breast cancers, women with triple-negative breast cancers, and women with metastatic disease.

Regarding nonpharmacologic interventions for menopause, more specifically with respect to lifestyle modifications, ACOG 2014 guidelines recommend to consider advising the following common-sense lifestyle solutions as reasonable measures for the management of vasomotor symptoms:

- layering of clothing

- maintaining a lower ambient temperature

- consuming cool drinks.

### Management of perimenopausal and menopausal symptoms [^1139iWPf]. BMJ (2023). Excellent credibility.

Most women worldwide experience menopausal symptoms during the menopause transition or postmenopause. Vasomotor symptoms are most pronounced during the first four to seven years but can persist for more than a decade, and genitourinary symptoms tend to be progressive. Although the hallmark symptoms are hot flashes, night sweats, disrupted sleep, and genitourinary discomfort, other common symptoms and conditions are mood fluctuations, cognitive changes, low sexual desire, bone loss, increase in abdominal fat, and adverse changes in metabolic health. These symptoms and signs can occur in any combination or sequence, and the link to menopause may even be elusive. Estrogen based hormonal therapies are the most effective treatments for many of the symptoms and, in the absence of contraindications to treatment, have a generally favorable benefit:risk ratio for women below age 60 and within 10 years of the onset of menopause. Non-hormonal treatment options are also available. Although a symptom driven treatment approach with individualized decision making can improve health and quality of life for midlife women, menopausal symptoms remain substantially undertreated by healthcare providers.

### Can depression be a menopause-associated risk? [^114ceTJr]. BMC Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Estrogen-based therapies have shown superior antidepressant effects compared to placebo when administered to perimenopausal women. The antidepressant effects of estrogen were observed even in the absence of concomitant vasomotor symptoms. Older, postmenopausal women, however, showed little or no response to estrogen therapy for the alleviation of depressive symptoms. Taken together, these observations suggest that estrogen's antidepressant effect may have a 'critical window' or optimal timing, possibly during the MT and early postmenopausal years; moreover, the potential benefits of E2 therapy for the improvement of mood symptoms may occur independent from changes/improvement of vasomotor symptoms.

As symptomatic midlife women may endorse a wide variety of physical and emotional complaints, physicians and other health professionals have the challenging task to disentangle the biological and psychosocial aspects that could be primarily attributed to (a) the aging process per se; (b) the menopausal transition; (c) the emergence of new onset/recurrent depression.

### Prevalence of sexual symptoms in relation to menopause in women in Asia: a systematic review [^111QbbeU]. Menopause (2018). Low credibility.

Objective

This systematic review of the literature was undertaken to investigate the prevalence of sexual symptoms in women in Asia in relation to their menopause status.

Methods

MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, SCOPUS, and Google scholar were searched systematically for relevant population-based prevalence studies published between 1988 and 2016. The included studies were assessed for risk of bias using a risk-of-bias tool developed explicitly for the systematic review of prevalence studies.

Results

A total of 34 articles, comprising 24,743 women, were included. In Asia, diminished sexual desire appears to be highly prevalent amongst postmenopausal women. Vulvovaginal atrophy symptoms are common after menopause in some Asian countries, but are either less common or under-reported in other Asian countries. The review highlights the paucity of data pertaining to menopause and sexual well-being in Asia, and the lack of prevalence studies that have assessed sexual function using a validated questionnaire. Most of the included studies had a high risk of bias, especially in the four items that pertain to external validity.

Conclusions

The available data, despite its limitations, suggests that after menopause, lowered sexual desire and vulvovaginal atrophy symptoms, including dryness, irritation, soreness, and dyspareunia, are common in women in Asia. The extent to which such symptoms cause women distress is not known. Studies of representative samples of premenopausal, perimenopausal, and postmenopausal women that use robustly translated and culturally appropriate validated questionnaires, and that collect detailed demographic data are still needed to determine the prevalence of sexual symptoms in relation to menopause in women in Asia.

### Menopausal hormone therapy and menopausal symptoms [^11112nGf]. Fertility and Sterility (2014). Low credibility.

A majority of women will experience bothersome symptoms related to declining and/or fluctuating levels of estrogen during their menopausal transition. Vasomotor symptoms, vaginal dryness, poor sleep, and depressed mood have all been found to worsen during the menopausal transition. While vasomotor symptoms gradually improve after menopause, the time course can be many years. Vaginal dryness does not improve without treatment, while the long-term course of sleep and mood deterioration is not clearly defined at this time. A small minority of women have vasomotor symptoms that persist throughout the remainder of their lives. These common menopausal symptoms all improve with estrogen treatment. Over the last 10 years, we have witnessed a dramatic reduction in enthusiasm for menopausal hormone therapy, despite its high efficacy relative to other treatments. We have also seen the emergence of sound, evidence-based clinical trials of non-hormonal alternatives that can control the common menopausal symptoms. Understanding the natural history of menopausal symptoms, and the risks and benefits of both hormonal and non-hormonal alternatives, helps the clinician individualize management plans to improve quality of life.

### The menopausal transition [^112SogCR]. Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

A clear understanding of the physiology of the menopausal transition, clinical symptoms, and physical changes is essential for individualized patient management, maximizing benefits and minimizing risks for the present and the future. Menopause, defined by amenorrhea for 12 consecutive months, is determined retrospectively and represents a permanent end to menses. Many physical changes occur during the menopausal transition and beyond. Knowledge of symptoms and findings experienced by women undergoing the menopausal transition allow individualized care- improving quality of life and enhancing wellbeing for years to come.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^117D87TK]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Guideline scope and shared decision-making for menopausal symptom therapy: This guideline covers the full spectrum of therapies for relief of the most common and bothersome menopausal symptoms, while the detailed management of early menopause transition, primary ovarian insufficiency, and prevention of osteoporosis and fracture are considered beyond the current scope. Choice of therapy is ideally based on available evidence regarding safety and efficacy and is generally a shared decision including both patient and provider, and the treatment selected should be tailored to the individual patient and will vary according to each woman's symptom severity, age, medical profile, personal preference, and estimated benefit/risk ratio. An accepted philosophy is that a fully informed patient should be empowered to make a decision that best balances individual QOL benefits against potential health risks.

### Premenstrual disorders, timing of menopause, and severity of vasomotor symptoms [^114LBGS3]. JAMA Network Open (2023). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Is presence of a premenstrual disorder (PMD) associated with higher risk of early menopause and menopause-related vasomotor symptoms (VMS)?

Findings

In this cohort study of 3635 female participants in the US, presence of a PMD was significantly associated with higher risks of early menopause and moderate or severe VMS.

Meaning

These results suggest a phenotype observable during the reproductive years that may allow clinicians to target women at risk of adverse experiences during menopause transition.

### Exercise for vasomotor menopausal symptoms [^11659ZDc]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2011). Low credibility.

Background

Evidence suggests that many perimenopausal and early postmenopausal women will experience menopause symptoms, hot flushes being the most common. Symptoms caused by fluctuating levels of oestrogen may be alleviated by HRT but there has been a marked global decline in its use due to concerns about the risks and benefits of HRT; consequently many women are now seeking alternatives. As large numbers of women are choosing not to take HRT, it is increasingly important to identify evidence based lifestyle modification interventions that have potential to reduce vasomotor menopausal symptoms.

Objectives

To examine the effectiveness of any type of exercise intervention in the management of vasomotor menopausal symptoms (hot flushes and night sweats) in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women.

Search Strategy

Searches of the following electronic bibliographic databases were performed to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs): Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised trials register; Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) (Wiley Internet interface), MEDLINE (Ovid), EMBASE (Ovid), PsycINFO (Ovid), Science Citation Index and Social Science Citation Index (Web of Science), CINAHL (Ovid) and SPORT Discus. Searches included dates up until 16–24 March 2010.

Selection Criteria

RCTs in which any type of exercise intervention were compared no treatment/control or other treatments in the management of menopausal vasomotor symptoms in symptomatic perimenopausal/postmenopausal women.

Data Collection and Analysis

Six studies were deemed eligible for inclusion. Three authors independently extracted data from eligible studies. Three meta-analyses according to comparator the group were performed.

Main Results

In the comparison of exercise versus no treatment/control (three studies), the non-significant effect size Standardised Mean Difference (SMD) for vasomotor symptoms was -0.14 (95% CI: -0.54 to 0.26); SMD was -0.04, -0.25, -0.38. For the analysis of exercise versus HRT (three studies), the non-significant SMD was 0.49 (95% CI: -0.27 to 1.26); SMD across studies was 0.13, 0.19 and 1.52, with all studies favouring HRT. In the comparison of exercise versus yoga (two studies), the non-significant SMD was -0.09 (95%CI:-0.64 to 0.45); SMD was -0.37 and 0.19. All comparisons were based on small samples. One small study reported data that could not be included in the meta-analysis; in this study hot flush scores were significantly lower in the exercise plus soy milk group (83%) than soy milk only group (72%).

Authors' Conclusions

The existing studies provided insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of exercise as a treatment for vasomotor menopausal symptoms, or whether exercise is more effective than HRT or yoga.

### Practical clinical guidelines for assessing and managing menopausal symptoms after breast cancer [^113K8Hp1]. Annals of Oncology (2008). Low credibility.

Background

The purpose of this study was to provide practical, evidence-based guidelines for evaluating and treating common menopausal symptoms following breast cancer.

Methods

Literature review of the causes, assessment and management of menopausal symptoms in breast cancer patients.

Results

A number of nonhormonal treatments are effective in treating hot flashes. Whether pharmacological treatment is given will depend on the severity of symptoms and on patient wishes. For severe and frequent hot flashes, the best data support the use of venlafaxine, paroxetine and gabapentin in women with breast cancer. Side-effects are relatively common with all these agents. For vaginal dryness, topical estrogen treatment is the most effective but the safety of estrogens following breast cancer is not established. There are limited data on effective treatments for sexual dysfunction during menopause.

Conclusion

Menopausal symptoms after breast cancer should be evaluated and managed as warranted using a systematic approach and may benefit from multidisciplinary input.

### Estrogen and progestogen use in postmenopausal women: 2010 position statement of the North American Menopause Society [^116zFqH3]. Menopause (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To update for both clinicians and the lay public the evidence-based position statement published by The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) in July 2008 regarding its recommendations for menopausal hormone therapy (HT) for postmenopausal women, with consideration for the therapeutic benefit-risk ratio at various times through menopause and beyond.

Methods

An Advisory Panel of clinicians and researchers expert in the field of women's health was enlisted to review the July 2008 NAMS position statement, evaluate new evidence through an evidence-based analysis, and reach consensus on recommendations. The Panel' s recommendations were reviewed and approved by the NAMS Board of Trustees as an official NAMS position statement. Also participating in the review process were other interested organizations who then endorsed the document.

Results

Current evidence supports a consensus regarding the role of HT in postmenopausal women, when potential therapeutic benefits and risks around the time of menopause are considered. This paper lists all these areas along with explanatory comments. Areas that vary from the 2008 position statement are noted. A suggested reading list of key references published since the last statement is also provided.

Conclusions

Recent data support the initiation of HT around the time of menopause to treat menopause-related symptoms; to treat or reduce the risk of certain disorders, such as osteoporosis or fractures in select postmenopausal women; or both. The benefit-risk ratio for menopausal HT is favorable for women who initiate HT close to menopause but decreases in older women and with time since menopause in previously untreated women.

### Menopause [^116M6Lgb]. Nature Reviews: Disease Primers (2015). Medium credibility.

Menopause is an inevitable component of ageing and encompasses the loss of ovarian reproductive function, either occurring spontaneously or secondary to other conditions. It is not yet possible to accurately predict the onset of menopause, especially early menopause, to give women improved control of their fertility. The decline in ovarian oestrogen production at menopause can cause physical symptoms that may be debilitating, including hot flushes and night sweats, urogenital atrophy, sexual dysfunction, mood changes, bone loss, and metabolic changes that predispose to cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The individual experience of the menopause transition varies widely. Important influential factors include the age at which menopause occurs, personal health and wellbeing, and each woman's environment and culture. Management options range from lifestyle assessment and intervention through to hormonal and non-hormonal pharmacotherapy, each of which has specific benefits and risks. Decisions about therapy for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women depend on symptomatology, health status, immediate and long-term health risks, personal life expectations, and the availability and cost of therapies. More effective and safe therapies for the management of menopausal symptoms need to be developed, particularly for women who have absolute contraindications to hormone therapy.

### The menopause transition: signs, symptoms, and management options [^113db1pe]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Menopause, the permanent cessation of menses, reflects oocyte depletion and loss of gonadal steroids. It is preceded by a transition state, the perimenopause, which is characterized by the gradual loss of oocytes, altered responsiveness to gonadal steroid feedback, wide hormonal fluctuations, and irregular menstrual patterns. The goal of this mini-review is to discuss the basic pathophysiology of the menopausal transition and the hormonal and nonhormonal management of clinicopathology attributed to it.

Evidence Acquisition

A Medline search of epidemiologic, population-based studies, and studies of reproductive physiology was conducted. A total of 758 publications were screened.

Evidence Synthesis

The reproductive hormonal milieu of the menopausal transition precipitates bothersome vasomotor symptoms, mood disruption, temporary cognitive dysfunction, genitourinary symptoms, and other disease processes that reduce the quality of life of affected women. The endocrine tumult of the menopause transition also exposes racial and socioeconomic disparities in the onset, severity, and frequency of symptoms. Hormone therapy (HT) treatment can be effective for perimenopausal symptoms but its use has been stymied by concerns about health risks observed in postmenopausal HT users who are older than 60 and/or women who have been postmenopausal for greater than 10 years.

Conclusions

The menopause transition is a disruptive process that can last for over a decade and causes symptoms in a majority of women. It is important for clinicians to recognize early signs and symptoms of the transition and be prepared to offer treatment to mitigate these symptoms. Many safe and effective options, including HT, are available.
