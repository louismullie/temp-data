## Question

High crp in immunosuppression

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about how to interpret high C-reactive protein (CRP) in immunosuppressed patients, including mechanisms, thresholds, pitfalls, and a practical decision framework. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the pathophysiology of CRP and how immunosuppression alters its production. Then, I should verify the clinical contexts where high CRP is most informative in immunocompromised hosts. Next, I will examine diagnostic pitfalls and confounders that can mislead interpretation. After that, I should review the comparative roles of CRP versus procalcitonin and other biomarkers. Finally, I will synthesize a pragmatic decision framework and highlight special scenarios where CRP remains uniquely useful despite immunosuppression.

> Let me first confirm the biology and kinetics of CRP so I don't jump to conclusions. CRP is a hepatic acute-phase reactant induced primarily by IL-6, with levels rising within 4–6 hours, doubling about every 8 hours, and peaking around 36–50 hours; its half-life is roughly 19 hours, and its concentration reflects synthesis rather than consumption, which is why serial measurements track inflammatory activity over time [^112AcW7J] [^111n5uqt] [^114coeC1]. Hold on, I should verify the immunosuppression angle: neutropenia and immunodeficiency can blunt CRP responses, and immunosuppressive drugs may dampen CRP production, so a "normal" CRP does not exclude infection in these settings, whereas a clearly elevated CRP still signals a meaningful inflammatory process despite impaired host defenses [^112YoH1B] [^115REQ6Y].

> Next, I should review the clinical contexts where high CRP carries specific meaning in immunosuppressed patients. In febrile neutropenia, a robust CRP rise supports an infectious trigger even when fever is drug-related or mucositis-driven, and failure of CRP to decline after 48–72 hours of therapy suggests persistent infection or a new process. Conversely, a blunted CRP rise does not rule out infection and warrants caution [^112CFEUi] [^112AcW7J]. In invasive fungal disease, markedly elevated CRP with relatively low procalcitonin can help distinguish fungal from bacterial etiologies, with CRP values in the 100–300 mg/L range plus PCT less than 0.5 μg/L offering reasonable diagnostic performance in hematologic patients, though I need to emphasize this is supportive rather than definitive [^111xx6Lt]. In COVID-19 hyperinflammation, CRP correlates with severity and guides immunomodulatory therapy decisions; thresholds around CRP ≥ 75–100 mg/L have been used to identify candidates for steroids and IL-6 blockade, and early CRP reductions after immunosuppression predict better outcomes, though I should double-check that clinical judgment remains paramount [^1138MxEE] [^117MY8BD] [^116JQRoi]. In surgical site infection and septic arthritis, CRP retains strong rule-in and rule-out value even in immunocompromised hosts, with higher thresholds often needed and CRP frequently outperforming other serologies in early detection, which I should confirm case-by-case [^1129VZCm] [^116qRQ5W].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic pitfalls before I over-interpret a single value. Noninfectious causes of CRP elevation are common in immunosuppressed patients, including flares of autoimmune disease, malignancy, tissue injury, and drug effects, so a high CRP alone is not proof of infection; serial trends and clinical correlation are essential to avoid misclassification [^112okvpw]. I should confirm that immunosuppressive therapies can suppress CRP synthesis, leading to falsely reassuring values; conversely, paradoxical or exaggerated CRP responses can occur in some contexts, so discordance between CRP and the clinical picture should prompt reassessment rather than anchoring bias [^115REQ6Y] [^112YoH1B]. But wait, what if the patient has advanced liver disease or is on dialysis? Baseline CRP may be chronically elevated in cirrhosis and uremia, limiting specificity, and in decompensated cirrhosis the CRP rise with infection may be attenuated, so I need to interpret both absolute values and deltas in these settings [^1116koaW] [^1155VAcq] [^1146CBD7].

> I will now examine how CRP compares with procalcitonin and other markers in immunosuppressed hosts. Initially, I thought CRP might be uniformly blunted by immunosuppression while PCT remains intact, but hold on, I should verify that nuance; transplant cohorts show PCT can be higher overall in immunosuppressed patients yet still track bacterial severity, whereas CRP and WBC may be lower, suggesting PCT dynamics can be more reliable for bacterial infection in some contexts, though not universally [^112z6AFD]. Guidelines emphasize that PCT has better diagnostic accuracy than CRP for bacterial infection in general ICU populations, but both should be used as adjuncts and not to withhold initial antibiotics in unstable patients; in immunocompromised patients, PCT may be less blunted by neutropenia than CRP, but false positives occur with ATG and other peri-transplant exposures, so I need to integrate timing and context carefully [^117SdwAz] [^112z6AFD] [^117XqCyo]. Let me reconsider the fungal scenario: high CRP with low PCT supports fungal disease, but I should confirm with mycology and imaging rather than relying on biomarkers alone [^111xx6Lt].

> Next, I should review a practical decision framework so I don't miss actionable steps. First, confirm the baseline: in immunosuppressed patients, a CRP above about 10 mg/L is abnormal and should trigger evaluation, but a normal CRP does not exclude infection, so I need to correlate with symptoms, vitals, cultures, and imaging rather than anchoring on a single value [^112YoH1B] [^117SdwAz]. Second, trend matters: a rapid CRP rise supports an acute process, and failure to fall by 30–50% within 48–72 hours of appropriate therapy suggests inadequate source control, a resistant organism, or a new process; conversely, a brisk CRP decline predicts better outcomes and can support de-escalation when clinically safe [^112AcW7J] [^116kUhnY]. Third, integrate with PCT and the clinical picture: in suspected bacterial infection, rising PCT with rising CRP strengthens the case, whereas high CRP with low PCT nudges toward fungal or viral etiologies; in COVID-19 hyperinflammation, CRP thresholds can guide immunomodulation, but I should confirm that the patient meets severity and inflammatory criteria before escalating [^111xx6Lt] [^1138MxEE]. Finally, tailor thresholds to context: for septic arthritis in immunocompromised patients, CRP thresholds of 100–180 mg/L improve specificity, and in surgical infections, CRP kinetics outperform static cutoffs, so I need to adjust expectations to the clinical scenario [^116qRQ5W] [^1129VZCm].

> I should double-check special scenarios where CRP remains uniquely informative despite immunosuppression. In invasive aspergillosis, persistently elevated CRP and IL-6 after one week of antifungal therapy predict poor outcomes and may justify escalation or adjunctive strategies, so I need to track early kinetics rather than a single admission value [^111LxniN]. In HIV with advanced disease, CRP ≥ 10 mg/L independently predicts 30-day hospitalization or death and improves risk stratification beyond CD4 and weight, supporting its use for triage and closer follow-up in resource-limited settings [^114RnmkA]. In PICS after critical illness, elevated CRP with low albumin and lymphopenia identifies patients at high risk of recurrent infections and prolonged recovery, prompting proactive infection surveillance and rehabilitation planning, though I should confirm the heterogeneity of PICS definitions when applying cutoffs [^1111Cag8] [^113ywbpz].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of immunomodulatory therapy in modifying CRP interpretation. Corticosteroids and IL-6 blockade can rapidly lower CRP independent of pathogen clearance, so a falling CRP after starting these therapies may reflect immunosuppression rather than microbiologic control; conversely, abrupt steroid withdrawal can provoke a rebound CRP rise that mimics secondary infection, so I must interpret biomarkers alongside clinical signs and cultures to avoid premature antibiotic changes [^115MiJzr] [^113APTyW]. Let me reconsider prognostic use: in COVID-19, early CRP reductions after corticosteroids correlate with improved survival, but I should confirm that this complements, not replaces, bedside assessment and microbiologic evaluation before making treatment decisions [^117MY8BD].

> In summary, I need to ensure that high CRP in immunosuppressed patients is never interpreted in isolation. A clearly elevated CRP still signifies clinically meaningful inflammation and should prompt aggressive evaluation for infection, noninfectious flares, or tissue injury, while recognizing that a normal or modest CRP does not exclude serious disease. Serial trends, integration with PCT and clinical data, and context-specific thresholds are the keys to safe, effective decision-making in this vulnerable population [^112YoH1B] [^117SdwAz] [^112AcW7J].

High CRP in immunosuppressed patients reflects **impaired host defenses** [^111n66qQ] and **blunted inflammatory responses** [^112YoH1B], making CRP a less reliable standalone marker of infection. CRP may be elevated in infection, inflammation, or drug effects [^117Rowvf] [^117XqCyo], but **normal or mildly elevated CRP does not exclude serious infection** [^115GxNzs]. Use **serial CRP trends** [^117Rowvf] alongside clinical assessment, PCT [^117SdwAz], and cultures to guide decisions, and interpret values cautiously in neutropenia, steroid use, or liver disease [^115REQ6Y] [^1116koaW]. Persistent high CRP despite therapy signals treatment failure or ongoing inflammation and warrants reassessment [^116kUhnY].

---

## Pathophysiology of CRP elevation in immunosuppressed patients

CRP is a hepatic acute-phase protein induced by IL-6 and TNF-α [^116gxDMn]; in immunosuppressed patients, **impaired cytokine signaling** [^115ecuw2] can blunt CRP responses, so normal or mildly elevated CRP does not exclude serious infection [^115GxNzs]. CRP may also rise with noninfectious inflammation, malignancy, or drug effects (e.g. biologics, corticosteroids) [^112okvpw] [^116gxDMn].

---

## Clinical significance of elevated CRP in immunosuppressed patients

Elevated CRP in immunosuppressed patients reflects **ongoing inflammation or infection** [^114Rhveo] but is less specific than in immunocompetent hosts [^notfound]. It can indicate bacterial, fungal, or viral infection, as well as noninfectious inflammation or drug-induced effects [^111xx6Lt] [^115MiJzr].

---

## Factors influencing CRP levels in immunosuppressed patients

Several factors can **alter CRP levels** in immunosuppressed patients:

| **Factor** | **Effect on CRP levels** | **Clinical implications** |
|-|-|-|
| Neutropenia | Blunted CRP response | Normal or mildly elevated CRP does not exclude infection [^notfound] |
| Corticosteroids | Suppress CRP synthesis | May mask infection or inflammation [^115MiJzr] [^113APTyW] |
| Liver dysfunction | Reduced CRP production | Lower CRP despite inflammation [^115REQ6Y] [^1116koaW] |
| Chronic inflammation | Baseline elevation | Difficult to interpret acute changes [^1146CBD7] [^1155VAcq] |

---

## Diagnostic utility of CRP in immunosuppressed patients

CRP alone has limited diagnostic utility in immunosuppressed patients [^112z6AFD]; **serial measurements** and integration with clinical assessment, PCT, and cultures improve accuracy [^117SdwAz]. CRP trends can help distinguish infection from other causes and guide therapy [^117Rowvf].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines emphasize **cautious interpretation** of CRP in immunosuppressed patients:

- **Serial CRP measurements**: Track trends to assess treatment response and detect complications [^117Rowvf] [^116kUhnY].
- **Combination with other biomarkers**: Use PCT, clinical assessment, and cultures to improve diagnostic accuracy [^117SdwAz] [^111xx6Lt].
- **Individualized interpretation**: Consider underlying conditions, medications, and clinical context [^112YoH1B] [^115UG2gn].

---

## Clinical outcomes associated with elevated CRP

Elevated CRP in immunosuppressed patients is associated with **higher risks** of infection, longer hospital stay, organ dysfunction, and mortality [^113ywbpz] [^114jxAGp]. Persistent elevation despite therapy indicates treatment failure or ongoing inflammation [^116kUhnY].

---

## Management strategies

Management of elevated CRP in immunosuppressed patients includes:

- **Identify and treat underlying cause**: Use clinical assessment, imaging, and microbiological tests [^116X8HCJ].
- **Monitor serial CRP**: Track response to therapy and detect complications [^117Rowvf].
- **Adjust immunosuppressive therapy**: Balance infection control with immunosuppression [^111DHsn3].
- **Use adjunctive biomarkers**: PCT, IL-6, and presepsin can aid diagnosis and monitoring [^114G8yLH] [^111LxniN].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Key limitations include **blunted CRP responses** in neutropenia or with corticosteroids, which reduce sensitivity [^112YoH1B] [^115MiJzr]. Noninfectious causes (malignancy, autoimmune disease, drugs) can elevate CRP and confound interpretation [^112okvpw] [^11625MMV]. There is no universal cutoff for immunosuppressed patients, necessitating individualized interpretation [^117SdwAz] [^116Uxc1r].

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

Elevated CRP in immunosuppressed patients reflects inflammation or infection but is less specific and may be blunted; **interpret trends with clinical context and other biomarkers**. Persistent high CRP despite therapy signals treatment failure or ongoing inflammation and warrants reassessment [^116kUhnY].

### At the peril of dialysis patients: ignoring the failed transplant [^116j2Nx9]. Seminars in Dialysis (2005). Low credibility.

Recently it has been shown that patients returning to hemodialysis (HD) following kidney transplant loss have poor survival, though the factors responsible for these poor outcomes remain largely unknown. In the past, we have shown that occult infection of clotted arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) leads to a chronic inflammatory state characterized by erythropoietin resistance, hypoalbuminemia, elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), and poor outcomes. It is well known that failed renal allografts induce graft intolerance syndrome, a clinical syndrome of pain, fever, and anemia, in the majority of patients. Similarly we have shown that failed renal allografts, by their nature as a nidus of chronic immunoreactivity, also induce a chronic inflammatory state. We speculate that this chronic inflammatory state, characterized by biochemical markers of poor HD outcomes, may be responsible for the excess mortality in this group. It is currently standard practice to leave failed kidney transplants in place upon return to HD and to treat symptomatic graft intolerance syndrome with immunosuppression. While this approach may reduce clinical symptoms in the short term, treatment failure and ultimately transplant nephrectomy occur in the majority of cases. There is also evidence that continued immunosuppression can even be dangerous. It should be noted that medical treatment of graft intolerance syndrome has not been shown to reduce chronic inflammation or decrease mortality. Similarly embolization of failed kidney transplants, another option for handling failed kidney transplants, has a high rate of treatment failure, has not been shown to reduce chronic inflammation, and nothing is known about the long-term safety of this approach. Therefore failed kidney transplants in patients with biochemical markers of chronic inflammation (as is the case for infected, clotted AVGs) should be removed prior to the development of clinical symptoms in order to eliminate the chronic inflammatory state.

Adult outpatients with acute cough — scope and key clinical questions focus on suspected pneumonia or influenza in nonimmunocompromised patients and frame eight PICO (patient, intervention, comparison, outcome) questions across diagnosis and treatment. The guideline states it "do[es] not include acute bronchitis and other upper respiratory tract infections" and "exclude[s] patients who are immunocompromised". It reports "Eight PICO questions were formulated", addressing diagnostic confirmation (chest radiography plus clinical judgment vs clinical judgment alone; C-reactive protein [CRP] or procalcitonin rather than symptoms alone to predict pneumonia; diagnostic algorithm/clinical prediction rule/diagnostic score plus clinical judgment vs clinical judgment alone to confirm pneumonia; microbiological testing plus clinical judgment vs clinical judgment alone to confirm pneumonia) and therapeutic strategies (antibiotics vs no antibiotics; nonantibiotic therapy vs none; antibiotics with atypical coverage vs without atypical coverage; antiviral therapy vs no antiviral therapy with outcomes including antibiotic prescriptions, visits, hospitalizations, or mortality).

### Marked increase of procalcitonin after the administration of anti-thymocyte globulin in patients before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation does not indicate sepsis: a prospective study [^117XqCyo]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Key messages

- Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) administered during conditioning before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation triggered a marked increase in both procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) with a peak at 24 hours after administration, followed by a steady decline over the next 3 days. This increase was not associated with systemic infection.

- The number of ATG doses was not related to the peak PCT concentrations.

- ATG induced an increase in liver function tests but not in markers of renal function. PCT levels were not altered by renal and liver functions or white blood cell count before conditioning.

- PCT seems to have no predictive value of future infectious complications.

- Both PCT and CRP have limited value in the diagnosis of infection during administration of ATG.

### Discordance between erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein measurements: clinical significance [^115VVzjw]. Clinical and Experimental Rheumatology (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are common measures of systemic inflammation. Our goal was to identify clinical factors associated with CRP/ESR discordance.

Methods

We identified patients with ESR and CRP results at our academic hospital over six months. We matched individuals with discordant results (one measure in highest tertile, other in lowest), by age and sex to those with non-discordant results, and reviewed medical records for laboratory and clinical factors. We employed analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Chi squared tests to compare these variables in discordant and non-discordant subjects. We used conditional logistic regression to estimate the relative risk of CRP/ESR discordance associated with each variable.

Results

2,069 patients had CRP and ESR measured on the same day; 87 had discordant results, 55 (2.6%) with elevated ESR/low CRP, 32 (1.5%) with elevated CRP/ low ESR. Underlying infection was associated with > 14 fold risk of elevated ESR/low CRP discordance (p < 0.001). Renal insufficiency was associated with increased risk of elevated ESR/low CRP discordance, (p = 0.003). RA patients were slightly less likely to have elevated ESR/low CRP, (p = 0.008, NS after Bonferroni correction). Low serum albumin was associated with both kinds discordance.

Conclusion

Infection, renal insufficiency, and low albumin were associated with having elevated ESR/low CRP; low albumin predicted elevated CRP/low ESR and elevated ESR/low CRP discordance. RA patients were less likely to have elevated ESR/depressed CRP. ESR as a measure inflammation in systemic rheumatic disease may be limited in settings of infection, renal insufficiency, and low albumin.

### Recurrent severe respiratory infections with low CRP secondary to autoimmune IL-6 deficiency [^115GxNzs]. BMJ Case Reports (2021). High credibility.

C reactive protein (CRP) is an inflammatory protein that is often used in conjunction with the clinical presentation of a patient to help with quantifying infection severity and measuring treatment response. We report the case of a patient who presented with severe pneumonias but had a suboptimal CRP response, later diagnosed as having an underlying immunodeficiency. This case exemplifies the need to consider immunodeficiency as an underlying pathophysiological cause in patients presenting with complicated and severe infections.

### Early proinflammatory cytokines and C ‐ reactive protein trends as predictors of outcome in invasive aspergillosis [^111LxniN]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Monitoring treatment response in invasive aspergillosis is challenging, because an immunocompromised host may not exhibit reliable symptoms and clinical signs. Cytokines play a pivotal role in mediating host immune response to infection; therefore, the profiling of biomarkers may be an appropriate surrogate for disease status.

Methods

We studied, in a cohort of 119 patients with invasive aspergillosis who were recruited in a multicenter clinical trial, serum interleukin (IL)-6, IL‐8, IL‐10, interferon‐γ, and C‐reactive protein (CRP) trends over the first 4 weeks of therapy and correlated these trends to clinical outcome parameters.

Results

Circulating IL‐6 and CRP levels were high at initiation of therapy and generally showed a downward trend with antifungal treatment. However, subjects with adverse outcomes exhibited a distinct lack of decline in IL‐6 and CRP levels at week 1, compared with responders (P = 0.02, for both IL‐6 and CRP). Nonresponders also had significantly elevated IL‐8 levels (P = 0.001).

Conclusions

High initial IL‐8 and persistently elevated IL‐6, IL‐8, and CRP levels after initiation of treatment may be early predictors of adverse outcome in invasive aspergillosis. Cytokine and CRP profiles could be used for early identification of patients with a poor response to antifungal treatment who may benefit from more‐aggressive antimicrobial regimens.

### Preoperative elevation of serum C – reactive protein is predictive for prognosis in myeloma bone disease after surgery [^112mkR3H]. British Journal of Cancer (2006). Low credibility.

DISCUSSION

Although elevations of C-reactive protein (CRP) serum levels in newly diagnosed patients with myeloma bone disease have been consistently associated with a poor prognosis the significance of preoperative CRP levels have not been clarified as of prognostic importance in myeloma patients, yet, and was, for the first time, subject of this study.

The major finding of this investigation is the inferior survival of patients with myeloma bone disease in whom CRP was elevated prior to surgery. This result replicates that of previous research regarding the role of CRP as a predictive indicator for the malignant potential and prognosis in various other cancers and suggests several possibilities: (1) preoperative elevations of CRP indicate a poor outcome in myeloma patients, or (2) bone involvement needing surgery is a significant adverse factor.

Alterations of serum CRP is a common feature in patients with malignancies which has been found to be adversely prognostic, with patients having elevated CRP levels. Growing evidence suggests prognostic importance because increased CRP levels are associated with the production of cytokines from tumour cells. For myeloma it is well known that interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays a crucial role in the cytokine network, regulating the growth and survival of myeloma cells and stimulating the acute-phase protein synthesis, notably C-reactive protein (CRP). Several authors investigating serum IL-6 in relation to acute-phase reactants and survival in myeloma patients report not only significantly shorter survival for those with higher concentrations of IL-6 compared with patients who had normal concentrations, but also demonstrate a strong positive correlation between IL-6 and CRP. As an assessment of infection status at the time of surgery was made, CRP rather appears to act as a surrogate marker for IL-6 activity and proliferative status of bone marrow plasma cells and has been regarded as a powerful prognostic marker in patients with multiple myeloma, than a sign for preoperative infectious states.

### Systemic inflammation and health outcomes in patients receiving treatment for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease [^112hepyy]. European Heart Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

We then selected the first eligible C-reactive protein level per patient to define a 3-month baseline window. This was done to minimize the potential for reverse causation bias (i.e. a C-reactive protein test is part of the workout for diagnosis of disease that leads to death). Thus, patients were required to survive at least 3 months after the first eligible C-reactive protein measurement, and the geometric mean of all C-reactive protein tests available during these 3 months was calculated as a reflection of their systemic inflammation. Finally, we excluded patients with comorbidities and/or long-term medications that modify or bias the interpretation of C-reactive protein concentrations (chronic infections — hepatitis, tuberculosis, or HIV — and ongoing use of corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). The end of this 3-month period was considered the index date of the study, where study covariates were derived, and follow-up for clinical outcomes began (see Supplementary data online, Figure S1). To clarify, the latest date that an eligible participant could be included in the analysis was 1 September 2021, and the participant needed to survive 3 months with study baseline on 31 December 2021.

### Withdrawal of immunosuppressant or biologic therapy for patients with quiescent Crohn's disease [^117WMpRd]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic, relapsing and remitting disease of the gastrointestinal tract that can cause significant morbidity and disability. Current treatment guidelines recommend early intervention with immunosuppressant or biological therapy in high-risk patients with a severe disease phenotype at presentation. The feasibility of therapeutic de-escalation once remission is achieved is a commonly encountered question in clinical practice, driven by patient and clinician concerns regarding safety, adverse events, cost and national regulations. Withdrawal of immunosuppressant and biologic drugs in patients with quiescent CD may limit adverse events and reduce healthcare costs. Alternatively, stopping these drug therapies may result in negative outcomes such as disease relapse, drug desensitization, bowel damage and need for surgery.

Objectives

To assess the feasibility and safety of discontinuing immunosuppressant or biologic drugs, administered alone or in combination, in patients with quiescent CD.

Search Methods

We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane IBD Group Specialized Register from inception to 19 December 2017. We also searched the reference lists of potentially relevant manuscripts and conference proceedings to identify additional studies.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective cohort studies that followed patients for a minimum duration of six months after drug discontinuation were considered for inclusion. The patient population of interest was adults (> 18 years) with CD (as defined by conventional clinical, endoscopic or histologic criteria) who had achieved remission while receiving immunosuppressant or biologic drugs administered alone or in combination. Patients then discontinued the drug regimen following a period of maintenance therapy of at least six months. The comparison was usual care (i.e. continuation of the drug regimen).

Data Collection and Analysis

The primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients who relapsed following discontinuation of immunosuppressant or biologic drugs, administered alone or in combination. Secondary outcomes included: the proportion of patients who responded to the reintroduction of immunosuppressant or biologic drugs, given as monotherapy or combination therapy; the proportion of patients who required surgery following relapse; the proportion of patients who required hospitalization for CD following relapse; the proportion of patients who developed new CD-related complications (e.g. fistula, abscesses, strictures) following relapse; the proportion of patients with elevated biomarkers of inflammation (CRP, fecal calprotectin) in those who stop and those who continue therapy; the proportion of patients with anti-drug antibodies and low serum trough drug levels; time to relapse; and the proportion of patients with adverse events, serious adverse events and withdrawal due to adverse events. For dichotomous outcomes, we calculated the risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis where patients with missing outcome data were assumed to have relapsed. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the primary and secondary outcomes was assessed using the GRADE criteria.

Main Results

A total of six RCTs (326 patients) evaluating therapeutic discontinuation in patients with quiescent CD were eligible for inclusion. In four RCTs azathioprine monotherapy was discontinued, and in two RCTs azathioprine was discontinued from a combination therapy regimen consisting of azathioprine with infliximab. No studies of biologic monotherapy withdrawal were eligible for inclusion. The majority of studies received unclear or low risk of bias ratings, with the exception of three open-label RCTs, which were rated as high risk of bias for blinding. Four RCTs (215 participants) compared discontinuation to continuation of azathioprine monotherapy, while two studies (125 participants) compared discontinuation of azathioprine from a combination regimen to continuation of combination therapy. Continuation of azathioprine monotherapy was shown to be superior to withdrawal for risk of clinical relapse. Thirty-two per cent (36/111) of azathioprine withdrawal participants relapsed compared to 14% (14/104) of participants who continued with azathioprine therapy (RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.72, GRADE low quality evidence). However, it is uncertain if there are any between-group differences in new CD-related complications (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.06 to 2.08, GRADE low quality evidence), adverse events (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.17, GRADE low quality evidence), serious adverse events (RR 3.29, 95% CI 0.35 to 30.80, GRADE low quality evidence) or withdrawal due to adverse events (RR 2.59, 95% CI 0.35 to 19.04, GRADE low quality evidence). Common adverse events included infections, mild leukopenia, abdominal symptoms, arthralgias, headache and elevated liver enzymes. No differences between azathioprine withdrawal from combination therapy versus continuation of combination therapy were observed for clinical relapse. Among patients who continued combination therapy with azathioprine and infliximab, 48% (27/56) had a clinical relapse compared to 49% (27/55) of patients discontinued azathioprine but remained on infliximab (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.68 to 1.52, P = 0.32; GRADE low quality evidence). The effects on adverse events (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.81, GRADE low quality of evidence) or serious adverse events are uncertain (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.21 to 4.66; GRADE very low quality of evidence). Common adverse events in the combination therapy studies included infections, liver test elevations, arthralgias and infusion reactions.

Authors' Conclusions

The effects of withdrawal of immunosuppressant therapy in people with quiescent Crohn's disease are uncertain. Low quality evidence suggests that continuing azathioprine monotherapy may be superior to withdrawal for avoiding clinical relapse, while very low quality evidence suggests that there may be no difference in clinical relapse rates between discontinuing azathioprine from a combination therapy regimen, compared to continuing combination therapy. It is unclear whether withdrawal of azathioprine, initially administered alone or in combination, impacts on the development of CD-related complications, adverse events, serious adverse events or withdrawal due to adverse events. Further high-quality research is needed in this area, particularly double-blind RCTs in which biologic therapy or an immunosuppressant other than azathioprine is withdrawn.

### C-reactive protein and uremia [^1155VAcq]. Seminars in Dialysis (2009). Low credibility.

Since the first report of elevated serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) predicting all cause and cardiovascular mortality more than 10 years ago, many other studies have recognized that the uremic milieu is associated with a state of chronic inflammation. The causes for inflammation are multiple and have been well studied in the past 10 years. Nondialysis, uremia related and endogenous factors as well as the dialysis procedure itself may be responsible for the high prevalence of inflammation in dialysis patients. Today, CRP serves to improve overall vascular risk stratification and, in the individual, to detect sources of specific infections. Because multiple factors contribute to the milieu of inflammation, the predictive value of CRP is rather nonspecific in dissecting a cause, with respect to the subcomponents of cardiac, vascular, and even noncardiovascular causes of mortality. So far, no specific pharmacologic treatment, including atorvastatin, has been identified that can substantially reduce CRP and accompanying inflammation.

### High attributable risk of elevated C-reactive protein level to conventional coronary heart disease risk factors… [^111YtMpi]. JAMA Network (2005). Excellent credibility.

Inflammation has been implicated in the origination and progression of cardiovascular disease, 1 and among the most actively studied biomarkers is C-reactive protein, an acute-phase reactant released predominantly by hepatocytes. 2 While low-grade inflammation is predictive of coronary heart disease, 3 even in the absence of elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, 4 the extent to which high CRP level is attributable to well-established CHD risk factors has not been well studied. A graded increase in the prevalence of high CRP levels was also apparent as blood pressure, glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, and BMI cut points increased from normal to borderline and abnormal levels, with larger increases occurring between borderline and abnormal ranges. Similar changes were also observed in univariate analysis comparing sedentary and physically active subjects.

The present study reinforces the central role that traditional CHD risk factors play in atherothrombosis by demonstrating that a pivotal biomarker of systemic inflammation, elevated CRP level, is generally accompanied by borderline or abnormal CHD risk factors and rarely occurs in their absence. Thus, while these data in no way negate the important influence that inflammation plays in promoting or accelerating CHD, 23 they underscore the likely role that well-established risk factors contribute to the inflammatory process. Several lines of evidence support a strong interrelationship between inflammatory biomarkers and CHD risk factors. For example, hepatic production of CRP is up-regulated by visceral adipocyte-mediated secretion of inflammatory cytokines. 24 In addition to interleukin 6 and nuclear factor κ, other proinflammatory mediators released from adipocytes, notably angiotensin II, contribute to dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and systemic hypertension.

25, 26 The present study reaffirms that elevated CRP level is strongly correlated with measures of adiposity27 as defined by BMI measurements for overweight and obesity. These close-knit relationships make it difficult to disentangle the distinctive impact of CRP level beyond well-established risk factors. Moreover, the treatments commonly used to reduce conventional CHD risk factors also lower CRP levels. 28–31 Therefore, given the tight interrelationship between systemic inflammation and CHD risk factors, and in view of the extremely low prevalence of high CRP level in the absence of the 8 risk factors in NHANES III, it is difficult, if not impossible, to prove the "CRP hypothesis".

### Initial antimicrobial management of sepsis [^113SqZtH]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Biomarkers to guide sepsis therapy

Clinical and biological signs of sepsis are neither sensitive nor specific, particularly in older patients and the immunocompromised, making decisions about starting and stopping antibiotics challenging in ICU patients. Intensivists have sought biological markers to define when to safely postpone antibiotic therapy in those with possible infection. In 1998, a biomarker was defined as "a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention". Ideally, a sepsis biomarker should differentiate true sepsis from other inflammatory conditions in a timely and cost-effective manner, and be able to monitor the response to treatment, guiding both when to start and safely stop therapy. Sepsis activates multiple biochemical and immunological pathways, and the release of various molecules that could potentially serve as biomarkers. Numerous promising biomarkers have been evaluated, but C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin are the most widely evaluated, in randomized controlled studies of antibiotic stewardship.

### Assessment for septic arthritis in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients: a single-institution study [^116qRQ5W]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prompt diagnosis of septic arthritis is imperative to prevent irreversible joint damage. Immunocompromised patients are at an increased risk of septic arthritis as well as secondary systemic infection. Our aims were to identify features predictive of septic arthritis and to determine whether these features differed between immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients.

Methods

A single institution retrospective cohort study was performed of 173 immunocompetent and 70 immunocompromised patients who underwent aspiration or arthrotomy for suspected septic arthritis from 2010 to 2018. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, and imaging findings were recorded. Multiple variable logistic regression models were used to assess for predictive factors for septic arthritis in both cohorts. Results were reported as odds ratios, 95% confidence intervals, and P values.

Results

In the regression analysis, independent predictive factors for septic arthritis in immunocompetent patients were younger age (P = 0.004), presence of radiographic abnormalities (P = 0.006), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (P < 0.001). For immunocompromised patients, only CRP was an independent continuous predictive factor (P = 0.008) for septic arthritis. A risk stratification tool for predicting septic arthritis in immunocompetent patients using age < 55 years, CRP > 100 mg/dL, and presence of radiographic abnormalities was developed. A similar tool was created using CRP > 180 mg/dL and radiographic abnormalities in immunocompromised patients.

Discussion

Differences in predictive factors for septic arthritis between immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients suggest dissimilar clinical presentations. The developed risk stratification tools allow one to predict the likelihood of septic arthritis in both groups. This may permit more accurate selection of patients for surgical intervention in the setting of insufficient data from synovial aspiration.

### Antibodies to C reactive protein [^1132eRDQ]. Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

C reactive protein (CRP) is a known indicator of inflammation. Serum CRP is often raised in patients with inflammatory conditions.

Objective

To determine whether individuals make antibodies to CRP and whether this might affect serum CRP concentrations.

Methods

An enzyme linked immunosorbent assay was developed for the detection of antibodies to CRP. Specificity of the reaction was determined by inhibition of the reaction.

Results

Sera from 413 patients were tested and 25 were found to be positive, particularly in patients with rheumatic diseases. Levels of anti-CRP did not correlate with serum CRP levels.

Conclusions

The presence of low CRP levels may not reflect the presence of antibodies to CRP.

### Predictive value of C-reactive protein for hospitalization and mortality among people with advanced HIV disease in Uganda receiving the WHO-recommended package of care [^114RnmkA]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

People with advanced HIV disease (CD4 ≤ 200 cells/µL) remain at high risk for opportunistic infections, hospitalization, and death, despite access to antiretroviral therapy (ART). We evaluated serum C-reactive protein (CRP) as a predictor of 30-day hospitalization or death among outpatients with advanced HIV disease.

Methods

We prospectively enrolled 1388 outpatient Ugandan adults with CD4 ≤ 200 cells/µL from May 2022 to February 2025, of whom 1378 had serum CRP measured at enrollment. Participants were ART-naïve or experienced, and people with known virologic suppression were excluded. Participants received tuberculosis and cryptococcosis screening and therapy per World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations. We examined CRP as a continuous and dichotomized predictor (≥ 10 mg/L) of 30-day hospitalization or death.

Results

Among 1378 participants, 41.6% had CRP ≥ 10 mg/L. Participants with CRP ≥ 10 mg/L were more likely to be hospitalized (Relative Risk = 4.2, 95%CI:2.3–7.8) or die (Relative Risk = 9.8, 95%CI:2.9–32.8) within 30 days. In a multivariable Cox model adjusted for weight, CD4 count, ART status, and age, each two-fold increase in CRP was associated with a 36.9% higher hazard of 30-day hospitalization or death (Hazard Ratio = 1.4, 95%CI:1.2–1.5). Including CRP in the multivariable model significantly improved prediction of 30-day hospitalization or death (AUC 0.80 with CRP vs. 0.72 without, DeLong's p = .009).

Conclusion

CRP ≥ 10 mg/L is associated with increased risk of 30-day hospitalization or death among outpatients with advanced HIV disease receiving the WHO-recommended package of care. Prospective studies should evaluate whether point-of-care CRP testing can enable real-time risk stratification to reduce AIDS-related deaths.

### The role of C-reactive protein as an inflammatory marker in gastrointestinal diseases [^116gxDMn]. Nature Clinical Practice: Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2005). Medium credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute-phase protein that is produced in large amounts by hepatocytes, upon stimulation by the cytokines interleukin-6, tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha and interleukin-1beta, during an acute-phase response. CRP is an objective marker of inflammation and, in gastrointestinal diseases such as Crohn's disease and acute pancreatitis, its levels correlate well with clinical disease activity. In contrast to its use as a marker in Crohn's disease, however, CRP is a less reliable marker of inflammation and disease activity in patients with ulcerative colitis, except perhaps for severe, extensive colitis. The increased production of CRP after an acute-phase stimulus, such as active gut inflammation, might explain why strong anti-inflammatory agents, such as anti-tumor-necrosis-factor-alpha antibodies and other biologic agents, work particularly well in patients with increased levels of CRP. CRP is also useful as a laboratory marker to predict prognosis and relapse in patients with Crohn's disease and acute pancreatitis. Elevated CRP levels have been associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer and are a marker of poor prognosis, indicating more advanced disease and, possibly, reduced survival. An important question that remains is how often CRP levels should be measured. Until there are more data, the use of CRP and of other biomarkers should be seen as an additional tool that aids clinical observation and physical examination, but that cannot replace it.

### Serum levels of cytokines and C-reactive protein in acute ischemic stroke patients, and their relationship to stroke lateralization, type, and infarct volume [^116n2ETP]. Journal of Neurology (2011). Low credibility.

There is increasing evidence that inflammation plays an important role in the progression of acute ischemic stroke (AIS). The primary aims of this study were to examine the serum levels of 13 cytokines, C-reactive protein (CRP), glucose, and hemoglobin in AIS patients, and their relationship to stroke lateralization, type, and infarct volume. Forty-five patients with AIS were evaluated. Blood samples were taken within 72 h, and volumetric analyses performed within 1–7 days after AIS onset. Cytokines were measured in serum from all patients and from 40 control subjects using Luminex Bio-Plex XMap technology. The levels of interleukin (IL)-1ra (p < 0.001), IL-6 (p < 0.001), IL-8 (p < 0.001), IL-9 (p = 0.038), IL-10 (p = 0.001), IL-12 (p = 0.001), IL-18 (p < 0.001), and GRO-α (CXCL1) (p = 0.017) were significantly higher in the AIS patients than in the controls. The IL-8 level was significantly correlated with age in the patient group (r = 0.52, p < 0.001). None of the variables were found to be associated with stroke lateralization. Infarct volume was significantly positively correlated with CRP level (r = 0.47, p = 0.005). Patients with radiologically confirmed infarctions had significantly elevated serum levels of GRO-α (p = 0.023). The cytokine profile of the AIS patients supports not only earlier findings of a proinflammatory response but also early activation of endogenous immunosuppressive mechanisms. Novel findings of this study are elevated serum levels of IL-9 and GRO-α. Elevated GRO-α in AIS patients with radiologically confirmed infarctions suggests that GRO-α is specific for stroke of known etiology. Our results indicate that CRP plays an important role in the progression of cerebral tissue injury.

### Insights into the use of C-reactive protein as a diagnostic index of disease severity in COVID-19 infections [^116mw7YP]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Approximately 20% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) develop potentially life-threatening pathologies involving hyperinflammation, cytokine storm, septic shock complications, coagulation dysfunction, and multiple organ failure. Blood levels of the prototypic acute phase reactant, C-reactive protein (CRP), which is hepatically synthesized and released in response to interleukin-6 stimulation, is markedly elevated in patients with COVID-19. Markedly high CRP levels correlate with poor prognosis for survival. Insights into CRP structure-function relationships have uncovered both pro- and anti-inflammatory isoforms that may be used to monitor the extent of tissue damage associated with COVID-19 pathologies and prognoses. Herein, rationale is given for interpretation of CRP blood levels as a simple, rapid, and cost-effective way to assess disease severity and help guide therapeutic options in COVID-19 patients.

### Insights into the use of C-reactive protein as a diagnostic index of disease severity in COVID-19 infections [^114coeC1]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

Since December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has continued to extend over most of the world, infecting several millions of people and causing more than 250,000 deaths to date (, accessed on May 6, 2020). There has been an intense focus on technologies to diagnose infections by the virus and to assess the prevalence of the infection. Equally important, there has been an unprecedented effort to identify and develop drugs, vaccines, and technologies to treat and prevent further infections as well as to assess disease severity and reduce mortality in affected patients. The purpose of this article was to offer an insight into the potential use of C-reactive protein (CRP) levels as a diagnostic index of disease severity and a guide for therapeutic options in COVID-19–infected patients.

Approximately 20% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) develop potentially life-threatening pathologies involving acute inflammation, cytokine storm, septic shock complications, coagulation dysfunction, metabolic acidosis, hypoxia, and multiple organ failure. Consistent blood markers in afflicted patients are normal to low white cell counts and elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels which, among its many activities, signal the liver to increase synthesis and secretion of CRP. –

C-reactive protein is a widely used diagnostic marker primarily used to assess ongoing inflammation. It is a key protein of the acute phase response, appears in blood within 6–10 hours of any tissue damaging event, has a plasma half-life of 19 hours, and is produced without a memory response. Although its appearance in blood is associated with ongoing inflammatory responses, it does not selectively accumulate into any tissue or organ even in patients known to have ongoing, prominent inflammation. Furthermore, its fractional catabolic rate is independent of its plasma concentration, indicating its rapidly changing blood concentration more nearly reflects on its synthesis rate and not its consumption rate.

### Dexamethasone and tocilizumab treatment considerably reduces the value of C-reactive protein and procalcitonin to detect secondary bacterial infections in COVID-19 patients [^113APTyW]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study shows that in critically ill COVID-19 patients, the inflammatory biomarkers CRP and PCT show a rebound increase upon cessation of dexamethasone treatment, potentially leading to false-positive findings. Furthermore, the use of immunomodulatory treatments in critically ill COVID-19 patients considerably reduces the value of PCT and CRP for detection of secondary infections, reflecting a false-negative finding. As a result, clinicians should not rely on these biomarkers, but assess basic clinical infection signs and cultures to detect secondary infections in COVID-19 patients that received these immunomodulating treatments.

### Pilot study evaluating C-reactive protein levels in the assessment of response to treatment of severe bloodstream infection [^115RUEUn]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2005). Low credibility.

We evaluated the usefulness of monitoring daily C-reactive protein (CRP) levels after initiation of antimicrobial therapy in 44 patients with bloodstream infection. The ratio of the CRP level during therapy to the level at the start of antimicrobial therapy (CRP ratio) was measured. A CRP ratio of > 0.58 at day 4 of therapy was a marker of poor outcome (sensitivity, 0.89; specificity, 0.69). The recognition of a pattern of CRP-ratio response was useful in the prediction of individual clinical course.

### C-reactive protein elevation is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in elderly burned patients [^113kbR6d]. Burns (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute-phase protein produced in response to inflammation after traumatic injury. We posit that C-reactive protein (CRP) is reliable in predicting morbidity and mortality following severe burn. In this study, we explored the relationship between serum CRP values and clinical outcomes in the severely burned.

Methods

Using the Research Network within the TriNetX database, we queried de-identified burn patient data across the United States and enrolled 36,556 burn patients with reported CRP values from 2006 to 2020.

Results

Circulating CRP levels were elevated significantly in patients ≥ 60 years as well as in males and African Americans (p < 0.05). CRP levels reached the zenith on the first day after burn, and were highest when burn size reached 60% total body surface area (TBSA). After bisecting the data at 10 mg/L of CRP, we compared clinical findings between patient groups (n = 16,284/18,647 in high/low CRP levels). The risk of patient death doubled in the high CRP group from 4.687% to 9.313%, with higher incidences of sepsis, skin infection, and myocardial infarction (p < 0.05). Moreover, mortality increased from 0.9% to 1.926% in those younger than 20 years when comparing the low and high CRP groups, whereas mortality significantly increased from 8.84% to 15.818% in those ≥ 60 years old (p < 0.05). Both elderly and paediatric groups had significant increases in the diagnosis of sepsis-associated with increased CRP expression. However, incidences of skin infection, pneumonia, and acute kidney injury increased significantly only in the elderly group (p < 0.05).

Conclusion

Elevated CRP expression is common in burn patients. The factor of age influenced the association of CRP expression to clinical outcomes.

### Association of COVID-19 with acute and post-acute risk of multiple different complications and mortality in patients infected with omicron variant stratified by initial disease severity: a cohort study in Hong Kong [^113bk8Y3]. BMC Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

SARS-CoV-2 infection leading to COVID-19 and the subsequent persistence of symptoms in an estimated 10% of infected patients beyond initial illness is recognized as "Post-acute sequelae SARS-CoV-2" infection (PASC) or "long COVID". Previously, we have described the association of COVID-19 with increased risk of multiple different disease outcomes. The exact pathophysiology of COVID-19 and its consequent long-term sequelae is not yet understood but is believed to be multifactorial, and different lines of probable mechanisms have been summarized by systematic reviews and meta-analyses consolidating extensive research from several studies.

With the preliminary observations of severe COVID-19 symptoms being more prevalent in certain patient populations, public health experts have emphasized the importance of developing diagnostic tools such as clinical parameters and biomarkers to enable stratification of the infected patient population into groups in a graded fashion from lowest to highest risk of severe disease progression. Indeed, prior small-scale clinical studies in hospitalized infected patients have assessed the accuracy of using elevated levels of biomarkers such as the inflammatory coagulation biomarkers — D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP) — in predicting COVID-19 prognosis and mortality risk. Further, requirement of intensive care unit admission and/or requiring supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation support have been associated with poor disease prognosis/disease severity and mortality in infected patients, especially in vulnerable patient populations such as the elderly and the immunocompromised. Evidence on the dynamic increase in viral load (corresponding to lower cycle threshold (CT) values of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test) in patients after initial infection has also been associated with higher risk of disease severity and/or mortality by few studies. Moreover, some studies have observed post-COVID sequelae or "long COVID" to be more prevalent in patients with higher severity of initial acute-phase disease. Hence, using clinical parameters including biomarkers as diagnostic tools to stratify COVID-19 patient population into subgroups by progressive increase in relative risks of developing multiple different disease outcomes may enable tailoring of treatment strategies to the needs of patients in each of these subgroups per the associated patient risk for developing the different outcomes. Thereby, vulnerable groups particularly at higher relative risks of developing persistent, long-term severe disease outcomes from COVID-19 may benefit from early identification through screening by diagnostic clinical parameters to receive additional monitoring and/or specialized multispecialty follow-up care post initial infection to minimize future possibility of morbidity and mortality.

### A proposal for a comprehensive approach to infections across the surgical pathway [^111n5uqt]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Question 17. What is the role of the biomarkers in surgery?

Statement 17.1. C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) can help clinicians to diagnose surgical infections.

Statement 17.2. PCT can help clinicians in early discontinuation of antibiotics in critically ill patients and in patients undergoing intervention for acute peritonitis.

Although more than a hundred biomarkers have been studied, only a limited number of them became routinely available in clinical practice. CRP and PCT are the more frequently studied and used biomarkers.

Serum CRP is an acute-phase protein synthesized exclusively in the liver. Its secretion is initiated 4 to 6 h after an inflammatory insult (effect mediated by cytokines namely interleukin-6), and its concentration doubles every 8 h with a peak at 36–50 h. The sole determinant of CRP plasmatic levels is its synthesis rate, which is proportional to the intensity of the inflammatory insult. Its production and elimination are not influenced by renal replacement therapy or immunosuppression (both systemic steroids and neutropenia). It has a sensitivity of 68–92% and a specificity of 40–67% as a marker of bacterial infection. Its low specificity and inability to differentiate bacterial infections from non-infectious causes of inflammation make CRP of limited diagnostic value. The available assays for CRP measurement are reliable, stable, reproducible, rapid, inexpensive, and present an acceptable limit of detection (0.3–5 mg/L). CRP has been analyzed in multiple clinical contexts, but only a small number of studies have focused on its use for optimizing antibiotic therapy. In primary care, CRP improves the assessment of the severity of infection and extent of inflammation and performs better in predicting the diagnosis of pneumonia than any individual or combination of clinical signs and symptoms. A Cochrane review demonstrated reduced antibiotic prescription with CRP testing, which led to its incorporation in the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines for the diagnosis of pneumonia. CRP has been reported to be useful in the diagnosis of appendicitis; however, it lacks specificity. Multiple studies have examined the sensitivity of CRP level alone for the diagnosis of appendicitis in patients selected to undergo appendectomy. Gurleyik et al. noted a CRP sensitivity of 96.6% in 87 of 90 patients with a histologically proven disease. Similarly, Shakhatreh found a CRP sensitivity of 95.5% in 85 of 89 patients with histologically proven appendicitis. Asfar et al. reported a CRP sensitivity of 93.6% in 78 patients undergoing appendectomy.

### Persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS): a review of definitions, potential therapies, and research priorities [^1111Cag8]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome

Persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS) has been introduced as a clinical endotype of the CCI phenotype.PICS should be distinguished from post-intensive care syndrome, which can confusingly be referred to with the same acronym. Although the patient cohorts overlap between PICS and post-intensive care syndrome, PICS is a model for the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying CCI. This consists of a self-perpetuating cycle of ongoing organ dysfunction, inflammation, catabolism resulting in sarcopenia, immunosuppression leading to recurrent infections, metabolic derangements, and changes in bone marrow function.

Each of the terms within PICS has suggested surrogates. In the original description by Gentile and colleagues: (a) persistent was defined as an ICU stay ≥ 10 days or prolonged hospitalisation > 14 days; (b) inflammation as C-reactive protein (CRP) > 1.5 mg L −1; (c) immunosuppression as a total lymphocyte count < 0.80 × 10 9 L −1; and (d) catabolism as serum albumin < 3.0 g dL −1, creatinine height index < 80%, weight loss > 10%, BMI < 18 during hospital admission, or retinol-binding protein < 10 μg dL −1. There is heterogeneity regarding the definition of PICS. Mira and colleaguesgave similar cut-off values but suggested a lower CRP threshold of > 0.5 mg L −1 as a marker of inflammation and a longer ICU stay of > 14 days. With both definitions, it is unclear at what point these blood results need to be recorded. The basis for these cut-off values has not been fully established, contributing to the heterogeneity in definition. Using machine learning models, one study showed optimal cut-off values to define PICS as CRP > 20 mg L −1, albumin < 3.0 g dL −1, and a lymphocyte count < 800 μl −1 on day 14. Notably, this CRP cut-off value is 40-fold greater than that proposed by Mira and colleagues.

### C-reactive protein predicts outcome in COVID-19: is it also a therapeutic target? [^114V3kJh]. European Heart Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Reviewing the CRP field in 1981and again in 2003, I was able to show the range of clinical applications of CRP measurements and to hypothesize about a pathophysiological role for CRP (Graphical Abstract). Sensitive quantitative clinical measurement of CRP has three different roles: (i) as a sensitive screening test for an active inflammatory or tissue-damaging process; (ii) to monitor the activity, extent, and response to treatment of any disease process that triggers an acute phase response; and (iii) among the small number of disease processes, such as systemic lupus erythematosus and leukaemia, that themselves stimulate little or no acute phase response, CRP is a very sensitive and useful marker of intercurrent microbial infection. The exemplary study of CRP in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by Smilowitz et al. in this issue of the European Heart Journal illustrates the value of CRP for monitoring and prognosis in a most challenging clinical situation (Graphical Abstract).

The universal application of their actual CRP values is underpinned by the robust standardization of clinical CRP assays. The automation of clinical chemistry CRP immunoassays in the early 1980s, and resulting major expansion of CRP testing, had mandated robust reference standards. The World Health Organization therefore invited me to create and validate the International Standard for Human C-reactive protein, 85/506, on which gold standard all commercial clinical CRP assays have subsequently been based. The International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine and the European Union secondary serum standards were also constructed using CRP that I isolated.

The major acute phase response of CRP in COVID-19 was predictable, based on the known behaviour of CRP in general and particularly in severe viral respiratory infections. From the outset, CRP values were found to reflect the severity of COVID-19 and to predict outcome, as reported in many, mostly small, series published worldwide. However, the present report by Smilowitz et al. is distinguished by its large scale, its analysis in relation to more of the major clinical consequences of severe COVID-19, its highlighting of the additive value with D-dimer measurements, and its robust demonstration of prognostic significance. All of these crucial insights will increase in importance as new and effective therapeutic interventions become available, whether directly antiviral or targeting host responses.

### Septic arthritis in immunosuppressed patients: Do laboratory values help? [^117HnvGm]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

There are approximately 20,000 cases of septic arthritis diagnosed annually in the United States. It is a diagnosis that can be associated with notable morbidity, including joint destruction, sepsis, and even increased mortality, made worse by a delay in treatment. Prompt diagnosis therefore becomes critical for reducing complications. Accurate diagnosis, however, may be challenging because several pathologies such as crystalline arthropathies or inflammatory arthropathies may present with a similar clinical picture.

Septic arthritis has historically been diagnosed by combining clinical examination and laboratory data, with a positive culture remaining the benchmark for diagnosis. Waiting for the culture results however may require several days, which can lead to increased morbidity. Clinicians must therefore rely on testing that is obtained more rapidly but may not be specific for septic arthritis. Historically, these tests have included a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), synovial fluid cell count, and percent of synovial fluid neutrophils (% neutrophils). Previous studies have suggested the use of a synovial fluid cell count of > 50,000 cells/mm −3 from a native joint aspiration as the threshold for the diagnosis of septic arthritis. The addition of serum white blood cells (WBC) > 11.0 × 10 9 /L and ESR > 30 mm/hr with this synovial fluid cell count threshold has been reported to have a sensitivity approaching 100%.

Despite the near-dogmatic approach to the 50,000 cell cutoff, the evidence to support this value is limited. In addition, it is unknown if patients in an immunosuppressed state can mount an effective immune response to trigger this cutoff or if a lower value should be used for these patients to avoid a delayed or missed diagnosis. The purpose of this study was to review our immunosuppressed patients who had a diagnosis of septic arthritis to determine whether 50,000 cells/mm −3 is a reliable cutoff for this patient population.

### Review: diagnostic potential for collaborative pharyngitis biomarkers [^11625MMV]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2024). Medium credibility.

BIOMARKER VALIDATIONS NEEDED

While host response biomarkers can be helpful in distinguishing bacterial versus viral infection and active infection from colonization, their role in GAS diagnosis and treatment remains undetermined. Many biomarkers (both novel approaches and those in clinical use) do not distinguish between infection and noninfection states. For infections, biomarkers such as CRP, PCT, and WBC are often used to assess the presence and severity of infection. However, these biomarkers can also be elevated in noninfectious conditions such as inflammation, trauma, or certain autoimmune disorders. This lack of specificity means that while these biomarkers can indicate an inflammatory response, they do not conclusively differentiate between infection and other causes of inflammation.

Because many bacterial and bacterial–viral infections are self-limiting, antibiotic stewardship only requires simple identification of the antibiotic-requiring infections rather than a complete description of the complex etiology of each infection. With the development of more sensitive tests, there is concern that more antibiotics will be prescribed for self-limiting bacterial or viral–bacterial coinfections that would previously have gone undetected by culture or antigen methods. According to a recent report, newer biomarkers have exhibited higher performance, but their lack of availability and higher price, as well as CLIA status, may make them inaccessible. Therefore, future studies must identify the settings in which POC inflammatory response testing is most appropriate. Additionally, future studies evaluating the performance of novel biomarkers should have clearly defined criteria to determine infected versus noninfected status and evaluate impacts on laboratory and antimicrobial stewardship. Of critical importance, these studies must be performed in real-world scenarios (eg, where testing will actually be performed and using non-laboratory-trained personnel) to reliably assess test performance. Diverse groups from both sexes, patients with underlying conditions that mimic infection (eg, asthma), and immunosuppressed patients must also be included in future investigations of diagnostic methods based on gene expression. To facilitate comparisons between clinical studies, a bacterial reference standard also needs to be adopted. Future testing also needs to account for the impact that emerging pathogens, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, may have on the sensitivity and specificity of these approaches.

### National Lipid Association recommendations for patient-centered management of dyslipidemia: part 2 [^115Em7eM]. Journal of Clinical Lipidology (2015). Medium credibility.

High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in HIV — evidence and recommendation: Although hs-CRP is valuable to discriminate individuals at higher risk of CVD events in the HIV seronegative population, the data are not as clear in those with HIV infection. In a single center database, Triant and colleagues studied 70,357 patients with hs-CRP measured and found an increased risk of acute MI with elevated hs-CRP in HIV-infected individuals (OR 2.51), but bias in who was tested (n = 487 vs n = 729) and the lack of an absolute cut-off limit generalizability. Elevated CRP prior to initiation of ART was associated with a higher risk of progression to AIDS, CRP levels did not decline after 96 weeks with efavirenz, and in a randomized trial of pravastatin and fenofibrate there was no change in hs-CRP despite declines in LDL-C and TG, whereas in JUPITER the 44% risk reduction with rosuvastatin was associated with a decline in hs-CRP. However, until such time, the use of hs-CRP to adjudicate CVD risk in persons with HIV is not recommended.

### Elevated C-reactive protein levels, psychological distress, and depression in 73 131 individuals… [^1133kNp3]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

Results In cross-sectional analyses, increasing CRP levels were associated with increasing risk for psychological distress and depression. In prospective analyses, increasing CRP levels were also associated with increasing risk for hospitalization with depression. Conclusions Elevated levels of CRP are associated with increased risk for psychological distress and depression in the general population. Depression is one of the leading contributors to the global burden of disease and the leading cause of disability measured by years lived with disability. 1 Although the pathogenesis still is not fully understood, previous studies suggest that low-grade systemic inflammation may contribute to the development of depression. 2, 3. C-reactive protein is a commonly used marker of inflammatory disease when CRP levels exceed 10 mg/L.

4, 5 When used to study low-grade inflammation and future risk for disease, CRP levels are measured with a high-sensitivity assay. In cross-sectional analyses, increasing CRP levels were associated with increasing risk for the self-reported symptoms of psychological distress of not accomplishing much and wanting to give up but not for feeling nervous or stressed. In cross-sectional analyses, increasing CRP levels were associated with an increasing risk for hospitalization with depression. The ORs were 1. 30 for a plasma CRP level of

1. 01 to 3. 00 mg/L,
2. 84 for 3. 01 to
10. 00 mg/L, and 2. 27 for greater than
10. 00 mg/L compared with 0. 01 to

1. 00 mg/L. These risk estimates were slightly attenuated when adjusted for the multiple factors or for BMI and register-based chronic disease.

The main finding of this study consisted of an association of elevated CRP levels with an increased risk for psychological distress and depression in the general population. This association was observed in 73 131 individuals in cross-sectional analyses and in prospective analyses for hospitalization with depression.

5.2.7.3 Monitoring following immunosuppressive and biological therapy withdrawal

Statement 97. We suggest that patients in whom anti-TNF therapy is withdrawn should be observed for evidence of relapse. Monitoring of faecal calprotectin may be helpful in this context as levels may rise before clinical relapse occurs (GRADE: weak recommendation, low-quality evidence. Agreement: 97.9%).

As with stopping thiopurines, faecal calprotectin rises prior to clinical relapse. A study of serial faecal calprotectin, C-reactive protein, full blood count and protein electrophoresis at 3-month intervals after stopping azathioprine showed that calprotectin was the only predictor of clinical relapse in both Crohn's disease and UC. Serial measurement of faecal calprotectin offers a potential opportunity to escalate therapy prior to the development of symptoms, although prospective evidence to validate increasing therapy in this context is lacking. It should not be measured routinely in all patients, but targeted to those where there are significant anxiety or concerns related to stopping anti-TNF therapy.

### AGA clinical practice guideline on the role of biomarkers for the management of ulcerative colitis [^1115JohQ]. Gastroenterology (2023). High credibility.

Prognostic significance of biomarker magnitude and persistence in ulcerative colitis — The guideline did not examine prognostic significance of the magnitude and persistence of biomarker elevation, and a single measurement versus sustained or marked elevation may carry different prognostic implications than a more modest elevation. For example, in individuals with mild symptoms, fecal calprotectin > 2500 μg/g may carry different implications for management than fecal calprotectin of 251 μg/g, yet there were insufficient data to guide nuanced decision making. Combination of biomarkers, such as elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) with an elevated fecal calprotectin, may have different management implications than a single biomarker, and several novel biomarkers and panels require more robust clinical validation; the paucity of data was identified as a knowledge gap requiring further research.

### C-reactive protein, an early marker of community-acquired sepsis resolution: a multi-center prospective observational study [^116kUhnY]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

We have also previously introduced the concept of patterns of CRP-ratio response to antibiotic therapy. In the SACiUCI study, with a much larger sample size, we have reproduced the preliminary findings, demonstrating that patients with fast and slow response CRP-ratio patterns had a significantly lower mortality than those in which CRP-ratio remained elevated.

We went further in our analysis to study the association between CRP-ratio patterns of response with the evolution of the SOFA score. At D1, patients with different patterns of CRP-ratio response showed a similar SOFA score. However, patients with fast and slow response patterns showed an almost parallel and significant decrease in SOFA score. In contrast, in patients with no response pattern SOFA score remained almost unchanged over the study period. This comparable evolution between the CRP-ratio course and SOFA score was also observed in survivors and non-survivors. In other words, increasing or persistently high CRP concentrations, suggest persistence of inflammatory activity, and were associated with poor prognosis, whereas decreasing CRP levels suggests resolution of the inflammatory response, and was associated with a better outcome.

Our study has several important strengths. To date, as far as we are aware, this is the largest multiple-center study evaluating the course of a biomarker, CRP, over a period of five days that are the crucial days in which to assess an infection response. The majority of included patients were admitted with severe sepsis and septic shock and all eligible patients were included, without exclusions, independently of the presence of comorbities, previous antibiotic therapy, underlying diagnosis or bacteriologic isolates that make our study population more representative of the current clinical practice.

However, we recognise that our study also has limitations. The nonrandomized and observational nature of the study design bears the potential of unmeasured confounders that may have caused differences in therapeutic and supportive approach, namely initiation of antibiotic therapy. We studied a mixed group of medical and surgical CAS patients. It is possible that other types of patients (for example, solid organ transplant recipients, febrile neutropenia, allogeneic stem cell transplantation) as well as infections (for example, viral infections) may have different CRP time-courses. Finally, we only assessed CRP. It is possible that other biomarkers, namely procalcitonin, might have different results.

### Procalcitonin and other markers of infection. what should be their role in clinical practice? [^1143cL2Y]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2002). Low credibility.

Clinicians are always faced with a decision when confronted with a febrile patient; they must decide between what is an infectious condition and what is not, and between what merits hospital observation, what requires empirical antibiotic treatment and what needs outpatient follow-up. In this respect, judgement based on medical history and physical examination outweigh the predictive value of various laboratory markers of infection, as the latter generally reflect a nonspecific reaction of the host to widely different infectious and inflammatory stimuli. In the evaluation of specific subgroups of patients, e.g. those in the intensive care unit, laboratory tests should also preferably form a continuum with medical history and physical examination, aimed at clarifying host condition, the setting and the source of a possible infection.

### The relation between C-reactive protein and serum amyloid A in patients with autoinflammatory diseases [^115fyC8i]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Autoinflammatory diseases are a heterogenous group of disorders of the innate immune system. Patients with autoinflammatory diseases usually present with episodes of inflammation, manifesting as fever, increased acute phase proteins in serum, serositis (pleuritis, pericarditis and peritonitis) and/or signs of inflammation in other organs. Recurrent or long-lasting episodes of inflammation may result in organ damage and/or a decreased quality of life. One of the most feared complications is systemic AA amyloidosis. Systemic AA amyloidosis is caused by the accumulation of insoluble amyloid fibrils in organs interfering with the normal physiological functioning of these organs. Since amyloid fibrils in AA amyloidosis are formed by cleavage, misfolding and aggregation of the precursor protein serum amyloid A (SAA), a sustained high concentration of SAA is a prerequisite for developing AA amyloidosis. Even if patients with autoinflammatory diseases do not experience any overt clinical symptoms, inflammatory parameters, such as c-reactive protein (CRP) and SAA, can be increased (subclinical inflammation). Although many publications in this field state the importance of regular SAA measurements to screen for inflammation during and between attacks, another acute phase reactant, CRP, is often used as a surrogate marker for SAA. Multiple reasons have been named for the use of this surrogate marker. One of them is the impossibility of SAA testing in many parts of the world, another one is that the SAA tests are more expensive than CRP tests. Previous research has been done to evaluate the correlation between CRP and SAA. In these studies, variable correlations between CRP and SAA (rho = 0.2–0.8) were obtained. However, study populations across these studies vary greatly. Studies only including patients with Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) show a high correlation between CRP and SAA, but they also describe patients with a normal CRP level who did have elevated SAA levels, raising the question if there are specific circumstances in which CRP is a less suitable marker to predict SAA values in patients with autoinflammatory diseases. Previous studies already stated that CRP seems to be a less sensitive method for demonstrating subclinical inflammation in patients with FMF in attack free-periods than SAA. We suspect that multiple other factors might influence SAA, as for example medication. Most patients with autoinflammatory diseases are treated with colchicine and/or additional cytokine blocking agents such as Anakinra, Canakinumab (IL-1 blockers), Tocilizumab (IL-6 blocker) or Etanercept (TNF-alpha antagonist) and/or steroids. It is known that improvement or even normalisation of CRP and/or SAA levels can be seen when patients are treated with cytokine blocking agents, however, a significant decrease in CRP does not always mean a significant decrease in SAA as illustrated by Wu B. et al. Another question is: what is the cut-off value for SAA to prevent the development of AA amyloidosis and what is the best cut-off value for CRP to accurately predict a low SAA level. To our knowledge no long term follow up studies have been performed to determine the cut-off value for SAA to prevent the development of AA amyloidosis in auto inflammatory patients. In FMF patients different cut-off values for SAA (4–10 mg/L) are suggested to prevent the development of AA amyloidosis. In AA amyloidosis favourable outcomes in terms of mortality and renal disease progression are seen when SAA levels are below 4 mg/L. In infections and cardiovascular diseases normal values for CRP vary between 1 and 25 mg/L. The best cut-off value for CRP to predict a low SAA level is less clear. In a study with FMF patients, the authors decided upon a threshold value for CRP below 5 mg/L for children and below 8.75 mg/L for adults. This decision was made because a significant correlation between SAA levels and age was discovered. However, in 16% of the patients with a CRP level below these cut-off values, SAA levels were still above 10 mg/L. In line with this, Berkun et al. found that 34% of FMF patients had SAA above 6 mg/L while CRP levels were below a threshold of < 0.5 mg/L. The aim of this study was to establish the relation between CRP and SAA in patients with different autoinflammatory diseases. Furthermore, we wanted to investigate a cut-off value for CRP to accurately predict a normal SAA level and to describe factors that might influence the relation between CRP andserum amyloid A levels in patients with autoinflammatory diseases.

### Clinical impact of C-reactive protein flare response in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma who received pembrolizumab… [^116Gxzy9]. ASCO (2024). Medium credibility.

Abstract 634 Background: C-reactive protein has been reported as one of the useful predictive markers in patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma. Not only baseline revel, kinetics of CRP during medical treatment also has been demonstrated. However, there are extremely limited data on temporary elevated CRP levels followed by decreasing below baseline after administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors. The aim of this study was to clarify the clinical significance of CRP flare response after administering pembrolizumab in patients with advanced UC. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed patients with advanced UC who consecutively received pembrolizumab as second-line or later therapy between March 2018 and January 2023 at one academic center and six general hospitals.

Patients were categorized into 3 groups according to early CRP kinetics: flare-responder and decreasing to below-baseline levels within 3 months); responder; non-responder. Median follow-up was 7. 8 months. Progression and death were observed in 83 and 70 patients during follow-up, respectively. Median OS was 19. 8,
15. 2, and 7. 8 months in the flare-responder, responder, and non-responder group, respectively. Furthermore, Median PFS was 8. 1,
6. 3, and 2. 7 months in the flare-responder, responder, and non-responder group, respectively. In multivariate analysis, CRP-flare response was a significant favorable predictive factor associated with OS. The patients who developed any grade AEs were 33, 40, 20.

7% in the flare-responder, responder, and non-responder group, respectively. Similarly there were no significant differences in occurrence of severe AEs. Conclusions: CRP flare response was observed in 15% of patients with advanced UC who received pembrolizumab and favorable oncological outcomes were observed in these patients. CRP-flare might be a promising predictive and prognostic marker in patients with advanced UC who underwent pembrolizumab therapy.

### AAOS systematic literature review: summary on the management of surgical site infections [^1129VZCm]. The Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (2019). High credibility.

C-reactive protein in suspected surgical site infection — Strong evidence supports that C-reactive Protein is a strong rule-in and rule-out marker for patients with suspected surgical site infections, with Strength of Recommendation: Strong. Evidence from two or more "High" quality studies with consistent findings for recommending for or against the intervention underpins this conclusion; multiple high-quality studies and meta-analysis support the use of C-reactive protein in the diagnosis of surgical site infection, and it was found to be both sensitive and specific in detecting periprosthetic infection and served as an accurate screening tool, with a positive or negative value demonstrating the likelihood of the presence or absence of infection. Studies vary with respect to the timing and thresholds used to diagnose infection, and both Yi et al 2015 and Bedair et al 2011 confirmed its utility during the early postoperative period; while cutoff values at which an infection is diagnosed vary between studies, based on time postoperatively it has been shown to be a superior screening test relative to other serological studies. There is no risk with implementation of this test; however, elevated CRP can be misleading in cases of chronic inflammatory conditions, neoplasms, metabolic syndrome that can cause its elevation and therefore should be monitored over the entire course of treatment. Future research should focus on identifying more accurate inflammatory markers, and distinguishing a standardized set of criteria and thresholds to aid in the diagnosis of surgical site infection not only as it pertains to PJI but in other cases of SSI.

### Substantially elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), together with low levels of procalcitonin (PCT), contributes to diagnosis of fungal infection in immunocompromised patients [^111xx6Lt]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose

Serum procalcitonin (PCT) has become a routinely utilized parameter with a high prediction value of the severity of bacterial infectious complications and their immediate outcomes. Whereas the utility of PCT in differentiating between bacterial and viral infection is generally accepted, its significance in fungal infections has yet to be determined. The aim of the study was to determine the role of PCT testing in patients at high risk for invasive fungal infections.

Methods

Immunocompromised hematological patients undergoing cyclic chemotherapy treatment or allogeneic hemopoietic stem cell transplantation with infectious complications in which the infectious agents were identified during the disease course were evaluated. In patients with bacterial infection, positive hemocultures were documented, and in patients with fungal infection, the presence of either proven or probable disease was confirmed according to Ascioglu criteria. C-reactive protein (CRP) and PCT were prospectively assessed from the day following fever onset, for four consecutive days.

Results

Overall, 34 patients were evaluated, 21 with bacterial and 13 with fungal infections. Significant elevations of CRP concentrations (i.e., above the upper normal limit) were observed in all patients, with a tendency toward higher levels in bacterial (both gram-positive [Gr+] and Gr-negative [Gr-]) than in fungal infections. PCT levels were significantly elevated in patients with bacterial infections (e.g., predominantly in Gr- compared to Gr+), whereas in patients with fungal infections, we identified minimal or no PCT elevations, p < 0.01. For the fungal infections, according to constructed receiver operating characteristic curves, a combination of PCT < 0.5 μg/L and CRP 100–300 mg/L offers the best specificity, sensitivity and positive and negative predictive values (81, 85, 73, and 89%, respectively).

Conclusion

Altogether, our data suggest that the finding of substantially elevated CRP combined with low PCT in immunocompromised patients may indicate systemic fungal infection. The use of this combination might simplify the diagnostic process, which otherwise can often be lengthy and arduous.

### Using procalcitonin to guide antimicrobial duration in sepsis: asking the same questions will not bring different answers [^116Uxc1r]. Critical Care (2014). Low credibility.

To achieve safe and efficient short-course antimicrobial therapy in severe sepsis we propose an algorithm that may aid clinicians in their decision-making process (Figure 1). Using such a protocol, which remains to be validated in multicenter studies, we would be applying two very sound and validated concepts: patients with a fast response pattern to antibiotic therapy (early and substantial decrease in biomarker levels) have better outcomes; and most cases of severe infections may be treated with 7 days of antibiotic therapy.

Figure 1
Use of C-reactive protein and procalcitonin to guide antimicrobial therapy in critically ill patients. C-reactive protein (CRP) was tested only in a single center trial with predominantly medical ICU patients. This flowchart does not apply to immune-compromised patients (for example, febrile neutropenia) or to patients with infections requiring long-term antibiotic therapy (for example, infectious endocarditis, cerebral abscess, bacteremia due to Staphylococcus aureus). £ Most trials investigating procalcitonin (PCT)-guided protocols tested the role of this marker in guiding the decision of antibiotic interruption. Initiating antibiotics for all critically ill patients with suspected infection is probably the safest decision, regardless the levels of laboratory biomarkers. However, this decision must be reassessed daily. PCT and CRP are proposed as additional tools to diagnose infection, and different cutoff levels have been proposed in the literature. Consider stopping antibiotics before day 7 in patients with no proven infection (for example, negative cultures) regardless the levels of CRP or PCT. SOFA, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment.

### Withdrawal of immunosuppression in Crohn's disease treated with scheduled infliximab maintenance: a randomized trial [^117GRGgd]. Gastroenterology (2008). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

The benefit to risk ratio of concomitant immunosuppressives with scheduled infliximab (IFX) maintenance therapy for Crohn's disease is an issue of debate. We aimed to study the influence of immunosuppressives discontinuation in patients in remission with combination therapy in an open-label, randomized, controlled trial.

Methods

Patients with controlled disease ≥ 6 months after the start of IFX (5 mg/kg intravenously) combined with immunosuppressives were randomized to continue (Con) or to interrupt (Dis) immunosuppressives, while all patients received scheduled IFX maintenance therapy for 104 weeks. Primary end point was the proportion of patients who required a decrease in IFX dosing interval or stopped IFX therapy. Secondary end points included IFX trough levels, safety, and mucosal healing.

Results

A similar proportion (24/40, 60% Con) and (22/40, 55% Dis) of patients needed a change in IFX dosing interval or stopped IFX therapy (11/40 Con, 9/40 Dis). C-reactive protein (CRP) was higher and IFX trough levels were lower in the Dis group (Dis: CRP, 2.8 mg/L; interquartile range [IQR], 1.0–8.0; Con: CRP, 1.6 mg/L; IQR, 1.0–5.6, P < .005; trough IFX: Dis: 1.65 microg/mL; IQR, 0.54–3.68; Con: 2.87 microg/mL; IQR, 1.35–4.72, P < .0001). Low IFX trough levels correlated with increased CRP and clinical score. Mucosal ulcers were absent at week 104 in 64% (Con) and 61% (Dis) of evaluated patients with ongoing response to IFX.

Conclusions

Continuation of immunosuppressives beyond 6 months offers no clear benefit over scheduled IFX monotherapy but is associated with higher median IFX trough and decreased CRP levels. The impact of these observations on long-term outcomes needs to be explored further.

### C-reactive protein: repeated measurements will improve dialysis patient care [^111nJAGt]. Seminars in Dialysis (2015). Low credibility.

Systemic inflammation is a common feature in the uremic phenotype and associates with poor outcomes. The awareness regarding the importance of inflammation assessment in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients has risen in recent years, and despite the development of novel biomarkers, C-reactive protein (CRP) is still the most measured inflammatory parameter. Notwithstanding, the possible weak points of CRP determination, this biomarker has demonstrated being useful both for guidance in clinical practice and for risk estimation. In addition, regular determination of CRP among dialysis patients has been associated with better outcomes in different dialysis facilities. Because persistent inflammation may be a silent reflection of various pathophysiologic alterations in CKD, it is crucial that inflammatory markers are regularly monitored and therapeutic attempts be made to target this inflammation.

### C-reactive protein and coronary heart disease: a critical review [^114TjJkV]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Modestly elevated baseline concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP), the classical acute phase protein, are associated with the long-term risk of coronary heart disease in general populations, whilst the major acute phase response of CRP following myocardial infarction is associated with death and cardiac complications. The pathogenic and clinical significance of these associations is controversial. Here we critically review the evidence and describe large-scale epidemiological studies, novel experiments and possible specific therapies which will rigorously inform the debate. We distinguish between the potential pathogenicity of high acute phase circulating CRP concentrations in individuals with substantial tissue damage and modest but persistent increases in baseline values in generally healthy subjects.

### Elevation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels reflects renal interstitial inflammation in drug-induced acute tubulointerstitial nephritis [^116aPua8]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

Our study first demonstrated the relationship between systemic inflammation and local renal inflammation in D-ATIN. The SIS based on ESR and CRP values may serve as a marker of the activity of tubulointerstitial inflammation and assist with decision-making in the immunosuppressive treatment of D-ATIN.

### Serum inflammatory markers as predictors of therapeutic response in non-idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis fibrotic interstitial lung disease: a retrospective cohort analysis [^115jYGXW]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pulmonary fibrosis is believed to result from inappropriate healing or repair of damaged lung tissue. Significant organ dysfunction with shortness of breath, cough, and fatigue, may progress if underlying disease is not controlled. The pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis in non-idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (non-IPF) disease includes chronic inflammation, though specific pathways of lung injury and repair are multifaceted and complex. Prior reports suggest potentially good responses to anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive agents in non-IPF fibrotic interstitial lung disease (f-ILD), while others have suggested poor outcomes with related complications or adverse effects. Unique immunoregulatory environments in individual patients may explain why anti-inflammatory medications are effective in some but not others. Serum inflammatory markers, namely C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), are commonly obtained laboratory tests that may reflect the extent of background inflammation. An association between elevated inflammatory markers and ILD progression, regardless of treatment, was first postulated by a large cohort study which noted significant deterioration in pulmonary function testing in patients with scleroderma (SSc) who had a two-fold higher elevation in both ESR and CRP. Another observational study found any elevated CRP level was associated with forced vital capacity (FVC) decline in patients with SSc-ILD; however, there is no robust data to demonstrate that baseline or serial inflammatory markers may be predictive of clinical or functional response to anti-inflammatory therapy. We hypothesize that elevated pre-treatment serum inflammatory markers CRP and ESR may be associated with greater likelihood of anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive treatment response, as defined by lung function, and may help direct initial treatment.

### Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels in HIV-positive subjects with tuberculosis and pneumonia [^114BNfD8]. The European Respiratory Journal (2005). Low credibility.

Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia (PCAP) are common causes of lower respiratory tract infections in HIV-seropositive patients and may have similar clinical and radiological features. This study aimed to assess the value of serum procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in HIV-seropositive patients with pneumonia, and to investigate their potential role in differentiating pneumococcal from mycobacterial infections. HIV-seropositive patients admitted with pneumonia were evaluated prospectively, 34 with PTB and 33 with PCAP. All 33 patients in the PCAP group and 20 of 34 patients in the PTB group had elevated PCT levels (> 0.1 ng x mL(-1)). All patients in both groups had elevated CRP levels (> 10 mg x L(-1)). The PTB group had significantly lower CD4 T-lymphocyte counts, lower CRP levels, lower white cell counts, and lower PCT levels than the PCAP group. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that optimal discrimination between PTB and PCAP could be performed at a cut-off point of 3 ng x mL(-1) for PCT (sensitivity 81.8%; specificity 82.35%) and 246 mg x L(-1) for CRP (sensitivity 78.8%; specificity 82.3%). In conclusion, HIV-seropositive patients with pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia had significantly higher procalcitonin and C-reactive protein levels than those with pulmonary tuberculosis. A procalcitonin level > 3 ng x mL(-1) and a C-reactive protein level > 246 mg x L(-1) were both highly predictive of pneumococcal infection.

### How to use: C-reactive protein [^112AcW7J]. Archives of Disease in Childhood: Education and Practice Edition (2010). Low credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is an acute-phase protein that increases 4–6 h after an inflammatory trigger and peaks at 36–50 h. Levels decrease rapidly with the resolution of inflammation. CRP is generally highly elevated in invasive bacterial infections and is often used as a marker of inflammation. A single CRP level is neither sensitive nor specific enough to identify all children with serious bacterial infection. However, a raised CRP does suggest serious bacterial infection and should suggest further assessment is needed. CRP levels that fail to decrease, or continue to rise, after 48 h of antibiotic therapy suggest treatment failure. In infants with suspected neonatal sepsis, two CRP measurements 24 h apart that are < 10 mg/l are useful in excluding sepsis.

### Elevation of erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels reflects renal interstitial inflammation in drug-induced acute tubulointerstitial nephritis [^116hp1YV]. BMC Nephrology (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (ATIN) is a common renal lesion histopathologically characterized by inflammation and edema of the renal interstitium. It is responsible for 15–27% of acute kidney injury (AKI), with drugs being the most common cause. Unlike ischemic or toxic AKI, which usually induces acute tubular injury and results in an abrupt decline in renal function, patients with drug-induced ATIN (D-ATIN) sometimes have insidious renal dysfunction and are therefore more likely experience delayed recognition. A renal biopsy is needed to make a definitive diagnosis of D-ATIN and reveals the activity and severity of interstitial inflammation that usually directs immunosuppressive treatment. However, factors such as various contraindications, refusal of informed consent and limited technical support may stop the process of renal biopsy. It is thus of great importance for those patients clinically suspected of having D-ATIN, in whom renal biopsy cannot be conducted, to explore approaches that could deduce probable pathologic changes and indicate the severity of interstitial inflammatory cell infiltration, which could therefore help make therapeutic decisions.

The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are traditional inflammatory markers that have been used to help assess the activity of inflammation in various diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and vasculitis. However, there is still a lack of knowledge about the relevance of these systemic inflammatory parameters to renal inflammation. The current study was performed in a prospective cohort of D-ATIN patients. The clinical-pathological features and renal recovery of patients with different CRP and ESR levels were compared. Associations between systemic inflammation and renal tubulointerstitial inflammation as well as long-term renal outcomes were further analyzed.

### Marked increase of procalcitonin after the administration of anti-thymocyte globulin in patients before hematopoietic stem cell transplantation does not indicate sepsis: a prospective study [^115VcVob]. Critical Care (2009). Low credibility.

Introduction

Patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation are subjected to substantial immunoalteration that puts them at increased risk for acquiring infection. Immunosuppression during the conditioning phase before engrafting is induced by pharmacotherapy or total body irradiation. This results in significantly altered inflammatory response to infection. Clinical and laboratory markers of sepsis are of limited value. White blood cell (WBC) count is intentionally decreased and therefore has little informational value. Fever, another important clinical sign, can be caused by multiple factors or, by contrast, can be absent. Biochemical markers of inflammation – C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) – were shown to be able to reliably diagnose infection in the general population. PCT seems to be superior in the early detection of inflammation. It also enables the differentiation between systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis. PCT concentrations are increased even in immunocompromised septic patients. In neutropenic patients, PCT helps to identify those who require antibiotic treatment.

Anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) is frequently used as part of a conditioning regimen in patients scheduled for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In those patients, freedom from infection before engraftment is of the utmost importance. ATG administration could be associated with systemic reaction, including fever and hypotension, comparable to sepsis. The ATG-induced depletion of leukocytes makes one of the key diagnostic criteria of SIRS/sepsis useless. Thus, biochemical markers of inflammation could be beneficial to differentiate between infectious versus non-infectious complications in this specific population. We prospectively evaluated the validity of CRP and PCT to diagnose infection in patients receiving ATG prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. We also assessed renal and liver functions and their relationship to PCT and CRP changes.

### Insights into the use of C-reactive protein as a diagnostic index of disease severity in COVID-19 infections [^117RRMEx]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

In COVID-19 infections, CRP levels that are minimally elevated (e.g. between 10 and 20 μg/mL) can be diagnostic of mild viral disease. Therapeutic considerations might focus on ways to control viral infectivity and replication using viral neutralization concepts (antibodies/vaccines and receptor blockers), or inhibiting viral-specific enzymes (e.g. remdesivir). COVID-19 patients with moderate elevations of CRP levels (e.g. > 20–40 μg/mL) may harbor some level of (reversible) tissue damage associated with the natural response to combating the viral disease. If these levels are measured relatively early in disease progression, before a cytokine storm response, these levels may suggest a confounding bacterial infection or more significant tissue involvement in disease. Therapeutic considerations may include, in addition to viral neutralization, the use of antimicrobials and immunomodulation using interferon therapies or biologic agents that can neutralize pro-inflammatory factors (e.g. tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα, interleukin-1 (IL-1, and IL-6 inhibitors). COVID-19 patients with significantly elevated CRP levels (e.g. > 100 μg/mL) more readily reflect advanced tissue damage and pathologies associated with cytokine storm, coagulation abnormalities, and multiple organ failure. Such high CRP levels would correlate with a life-threatening prognosis.

### C-reactive protein in critically ill cancer patients with sepsis: influence of neutropenia [^1146Q53u]. Critical Care (2011). Low credibility.

Key messages

- In the present study we showed that septic cancer patients express a full blown acute phase response with marked CRP elevations, and that this was particularly significant in the presence of neutropenia.

- The CRP course during the first week of antibiotic therapy was not influenced by the presence or absence of neutropenia.

- CRP could be a useful biomarker of infection in cancer patients irrespective of the WCC and the degree of immunosuppression.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines on the treatment and management of patients with COVID-19 (September 2022) [^114xpjTE]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2024). High credibility.

IDSA COVID-19 guideline — laboratory markers and antibiotic stewardship: the use of procalcitonin in a group of hospitals was not effective as a tool to encourage antibiotic discontinuation compared to clinical judgment. Mason and colleagues compared hospitalized cohorts of 619 patients with COVID-19 and 106 with community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) and found marked differences in white blood cell counts (6.78 COVID-19 vs. 12.48 CABP) and that CRP declined in 48–72 hours with antibiotic therapy in the CABP cohort but not the COVID-19 group, suggesting these findings can guide discontinuation when antibiotics are initiated empirically in COVID-19. Initiating and continuing empiric antibiotics at admission may lead to resistant superinfections; one study found antibiotic use in the first two days of admission for COVID-19 to be a risk factor for superinfection. Immunomodulatory therapies are recommended for many patients with severe and critical illness from COVID-19, including corticosteroids, IL-6 antagonists, and JAK inhibitors.

### C-reactive protein in rheumatology: biology and genetics [^112zofN2]. Nature Reviews: Rheumatology (2011). Medium credibility.

Measurement of serum C-reactive protein (CRP) level is in widespread clinical use as a sensitive marker of inflammation. CRP has a role in the clearance of bacteria and of dying and altered cells, and might also have more complex immunomodulatory functions. Impaired clearance of apoptotic cells is important in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), raising the possibility that CRP dysregulation plays a part in this process. We review the available functional and genetic evidence supporting a role for CRP in the pathogenesis of SLE, but recognize that inconsistencies in the existing data mean that conclusions have to be interpreted with caution. More consistent is the evidence that the genetic variants influencing basal CRP level also influence the magnitude of the acute-phase rise in CRP level in active inflammation. Initial reports suggest that these genetic effects might be large enough to directly influence clinical decision-making processes that are based on an interpretation of CRP thresholds. This concept is explored further in this article, particularly in relation to the use of the CRP-based disease activity score in the evaluation of rheumatoid arthritis, where a systematic under-scoring or over-scoring of disease activity could result from a failure to consider the genetic influences on CRP level.

### Levels of C-reactive protein are associated with response to infliximab therapy in patients with Crohn's disease [^116ufMda]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

Background & Aims

Infliximab is an antibody against tumor necrosis factor-α that is used to treat patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD). C-reactive protein (CRP) is a marker used to identify and follow individuals with CD. We analyzed changes in levels of CRP in a large cohort of patients with CD undergoing treatment with infliximab.

Methods

Serial levels of CRP were analyzed in 718 CD patients. Blood was collected before each infusion; a total of 8845 CRP levels were available for analysis. The correlations between CRP levels and need for dose adjustment, outcomes, and mucosal healing (based on endoscopic analysis of 253 patients) were evaluated. Therapy adjustment was considered successful if therapy continued without need for change. Subgroup analysis was performed by using data from 268 patients who received 8 weeks of maintenance therapy.

Results

More patients with high baseline levels of CRP responded to infliximab than patients with normal levels (90.8% vs 82.6%; p = 0.014). Early normalization of CRP levels correlated with sustained long-term response (P < .001). CRP levels remained significantly higher among patients who lost their response to infliximab, compared with those with a sustained response (P = 0.001). At time of loss of response, CRP levels were significantly increased (median, 11.2 mg/L) and did not return to baseline levels (median, 18.2 mg/L; p = 0.039). CRP correlated with mucosal healing (P = 0.033).

Conclusions

CRP is a good marker of disease activity in patients treated with infliximab. Increased levels of CRP indicate mucosal inflammation and a likelihood of clinical relapse.

### Elevated levels of C-reactive protein independently predict accelerated deterioration of graft function in renal transplant recipients [^114ToZyk]. Nephrology, Dialysis, Transplantation (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic transplant dysfunction is characterized by a gradual decline in renal function with slowly rising serum creatinine. The underlying mechanism is thought to include inflammation and atherosclerosis. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a well-established marker of both inflammation and atherosclerosis. In this prospective study, we investigated whether CRP could be of use as a clinical marker for early identification of renal transplant recipients at increased risk of deterioration of graft function.

Methods

In this prospective study, all participating patients (n = 606) visited the out-patient clinic at least once a year, and serum creatinine was assessed at every visit. Subjects with a follow-up of < 1 year (n = 31) were excluded from analysis.

Results

A total of 575 patients participated at a median (interquartile range) time of 5.9 (2.6–11.3) years post-transplantation. Median time of follow-up was 3.0 (2.4–3.4) years. Changes in serum creatinine during follow-up were -0.45 (-4.83–4.76) micromol/l/year in 172 subjects with CRP < 1.0 mg/l, 1.04 (-3.36–6.12) micromol/l/year in 184 subjects with CRP 1.0–3.0 mg/l and 2.34 (-3.33–9.07) micromol/l/year in 219 subjects with CRP > 3.0 mg/l (P < 0.05 for comparison of the three groups). Proteinuria (P = 0.003), CMV IgG titre (P = 0.01), donor age (P = 0.01), CRP concentration (P = 0.02), recipient age (P = 0.02) and recipient gender (P = 0.047) were independently associated with change in serum creatinine during follow-up in a multivariate analysis.

Conclusions

Elevated levels of CRP independently predict accelerated deterioration of graft function in renal transplant recipients > 1 year post-transplantation. Further prospective studies are required to investigate whether early intervention can prevent deterioration of graft function in subjects with elevated levels of CRP.

### Diagnostic implications of C-reactive protein… [^114Rhveo]. JAMA Network (2003). Excellent credibility.

An elevated level of C-reactive protein, an acute phase protein, is one of many downstream indicators of inflammation. Physiologically, CRP enhances cell-mediated immunity by promoting phagocytosis, accelerating chemotaxis, and activating platelets. The purposes of this article are to review the clinical data implicating serum CRP level as a systemic marker of focal inflammation and to explore serum CRP level as a reflection of the inflammatory component of atherogenesis. Several prospective studies have demonstrated a direct correlation between acute myocardial infarction rise in CRP, postinfarction adverse events, 22, 23 and subsequent infarct size24. The European Concerted Action on Thrombosis and Disabilities Angina Pectoris Study also reported elevated CRP levels in more than 2000 outpatients with stable and unstable angina.

25 This study identified a 2-fold increase in the risk of MI and sudden cardiac death in any patient with a CRP level greater than 0. 36 mg/dL. In this 17-year study, increased CRP levels directly correlated with mortality. Results from the Physicians' Health Study, 28 a randomized, double-blind trial of treatment with aspirin and beta carotene in the prevention of cardiovascular disease, also documented the link between CRP levels and risk of MI and stroke in healthy men. Interestingly, when smoldering endovascular inflammation is suppressed with aspirin therapy, risk reduction is directly related to CRP levels. The Monitoring Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease 31 study measured CRP levels in healthy men with an 8-year follow-up. This study also identified an association between elevated CRP levels and the risk of both fatal and nonfatal MI in 936 patients. These results have been corroborated in several large, randomized studies.

51–55 Ridker and colleagues28 documented that the benefit of aspirin therapy was greatest in healthy men with the highest CRP levels. Although the risk reduction of MI in this group was 55. 7%, the beneficial effect was reduced as CRP levels decreased. These data emphasize the inflammatory component of cardiovascular disease and suggest that aspirin therapy may directly affect endovascular dysfunction, as indicated by CRP production. Furthermore, CRP level may serve as an indicator of patients at risk and as a practical marker of the efficacy of the preventive strategy.

### Dexamethasone and tocilizumab treatment considerably reduces the value of C-reactive protein and procalcitonin to detect secondary bacterial infections in COVID-19 patients [^115MiJzr]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is characterized by inflammatory damage to various tissues, particularly the lung. Hence, a wide range of circulating inflammatory markers are elevated in COVID-19 patients, correlating with disease severity and outcomes. This observation also holds true for procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP). As has been studied repeatedly in non-COVID-19 patients, these biomarkers also have discriminatory potential for bacterial (super)infections in critically ill patients and are frequently used to assist antibiotic clinical decision making. In addition, once antibacterial therapy is started, repeated measurements of PCT every 48–72 h may help guide the duration of therapy.

We previously investigated the natural course of PCT and CRP and their value to identify secondary infections in critically ill COVID-19. We showed that COVID-19 patients have elevated concentrations at ICU admission, that gradually decline, while a later increase in these biomarkers indicate a secondary bacterial infection. However, since then, pharmacological treatment of COVID-19-patients admitted to the ICU has changed considerably. The immunomodulatory drugs dexamethasone and the human anti-interleukin (IL)-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab have been shown to exert beneficial clinical effects in patients with severe COVID-19 and consequently have become part of standard care. The effects of these therapies on PCT and CRP levels in critically ill COVID-19 patients are largely unclear, but were previously assessed in non-COVID-19 patients. For instance, in patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia, corticosteroids attenuate induction of CRP, while the suppressive effect on PCT levels appears to be less pronounced. In critically ill sepsis patients, treatment with corticosteroids lead to a significant decrease in CRP levels. This effect of corticosteroids is independent of SOFA scores, illustrating the direct immunomodulatory effect independent of the clinical condition of the patient. Interestingly, it was also reported that withdrawal of hydrocortisone treatment results in an inflammatory rebound phenomenon in septic shock patients. Like corticosteroids, tocilizumab treatment also reduced CRP levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and in those suffering from giant cell arteritis. Also in COVID-19 patients, reduction in PCT and CRP levels was observed in patients treated with tocilizumab. However, differentiation between the immunomodulatory and beneficial effect on the clinical condition of the patient is difficult. Currently, the effects of dexamethasone and tocilizumab on the kinetics of PCT and CRP in COVID-19 patients are unknown. Furthermore, whether the value to detect secondary bacterial infections of these biomarkers is jeopardized by these treatments is unclear as well. In the present study, we investigated serial PCT and CRP levels in critically ill COVID-19 patients treated with dexamethasone only or in combination with tocilizumab, and compared the natural course and accuracy to detect bacterial infections to the data obtained from patients that did not receive these immunomodulatory treatments.

### C reactive protein impairs adaptive immunity in immune cells of patients with melanoma [^111n66qQ]. Journal for Immunotherapy of Cancer (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

High C reactive protein (CRP) levels have been reported to be associated with a poor clinical outcome in a number of malignancies and with programmed cell death protein 1 immune checkpoint blockade in patients with advanced cancer. Little is known about the direct effects of CRP on adaptive immunity in cancer. Therefore, we investigated how CRP impacted the function of T cells and dendritic cells (DCs) from patients with melanoma.

Methods

The effects of CRP on proliferation, function, gene expression and phenotype of patient T cells and DCs, and expansion of MART-1 antigen-specific T cells were analyzed by multicolor flow cytometry and RNA-seq. Additionally, serum CRP levels at baseline from patients with metastatic melanoma treated on the Checkmate-064 clinical trial were assessed by a Luminex assay.

Results

In vitro, CRP inhibited proliferation, activation-associated phenotypes and the effector function of activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from patients with melanoma. CRP-treated T cells expressed high levels of interleukin-1β, which is known to enhance CRP production from the liver. CRP also suppressed formation of the immune synapse and inhibited early events in T-cell receptor engagement. In addition, CRP downregulated the expression of costimulatory molecules on mature DCs and suppressed expansion of MART-1-specific CD8+ T cells in a dose-dependent manner by impacting on both T cells and antigen-presenting cells. High-serum CRP levels at baseline were significantly associated with a shorter survival in both nivolumab-treated and ipilimumab-treated patients.

Conclusions

These findings suggest that high levels of CRP induce an immunosuppressive milieu in melanoma and support the blockade of CRP as a therapeutic strategy to enhance immune checkpoint therapies in cancer.

### WSES-AAST guidelines: management of inflammatory bowel disease in the emergency setting [^115FsufJ]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Previous studies assessing the best monitoring of medical treatment measured prospectively some laboratory parameters such as full blood count, CRP, ESR, alfa1 antitrypsin, and orosomucoid in CD patients every 6 weeks after recent weaning of steroids and showed that the best predictor of short-term relapse is the combination of CRP and ESR. Patients with CRP > 20 mg/L and ESR > 15 mm had an eight-fold increased risk of relapse with a negative predictive value of 97%, suggesting that normal CRP and ESR could almost exclude relapse in the next 6 weeks.

Anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive drugs do not affect CRP production. Therefore, changes of CRP concentrations during treatment occur only as a result of the effect of the drug on the inflammation or disorder.

In addition, in assessing acute severe UC, defining the population by Truelove Witts criteria (summarized in Table 4) is essential. The Truelove-Witts criteria combine frequency of bloody stools (⩾6 per day) with at least one marker of systemic toxicity such as pulse rate > 90 bpm, temperature > 37.8°C, hemoglobin < 10.5 g/dl, and/or an ESR > 30 mm/h. In patients with UC, the risk of progression to the second-line therapy is directly dependent on the number of variables present on admission, with a 50% risk for colectomy when three or more additional criteria are present. After 3 days of intensive treatment (hydrocortisone and/or cyclosporine/anti-TNF) patients with frequent stools (> 8/day), or 3–8 stools/day and CRP > 45 mg/L, should be identified and reviewed jointly by a gastroenterologist and surgeon as most of them will need to undergo colectomy.

### Monitoring of inflammation in patients on dialysis: forewarned is forearmed [^1146CBD7]. Nature Reviews: Nephrology (2011). Medium credibility.

Current evidence about the effects of inflammation on the outcomes of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) generally originates from single measurements of inflammatory biomarkers. Patients with CKD, however, are exposed to persistent low-grade inflammation and levels of serum inflammatory markers are subjected to a substantial variability over time, being influenced by multiple processes, such as transient infections, comorbidities, and the intermittent stimulus of dialysis. Understanding and evaluating inflammation in the context of its time-dependent oscillations in renal disease fluctuation is, therefore, important. Nevertheless, the relationship between longitudinal inflammatory variation and risk prediction has so far been addressed in only a few studies, not all of which have been sufficiently powered. Consequently, uncertainty exists about how to interpret the findings of these studies in the clinical setting. The purpose of this Review is to explore the reasons and implications of variability in levels of inflammatory biomarkers in patients with uremia, specifically focusing on C-reactive protein (CRP) measurements. We also discuss the value of repeated versus single measurements of inflammation in the clinical setting and provide solutions to reduce both sample size and intraindividual variability in hypothetical, randomized controlled trials aimed at reducing CRP levels in patients undergoing hemodialysis.

### C-reactive protein is linked to disease activity, impact, and response to treatment in patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria [^116i4fdM]. Allergy (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), a sensitive marker of inflammation, have been consistently reported in chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). Here, we retrospectively analyzed data from 1253 CSU patients from 2 centers to answer the following questions: (i) What is the prevalence of elevated levels of CRP in CSU? (ii) Why do CSU patients show elevated levels of CRP? (iii) Are elevated CRP levels relevant?

Methods

Serum levels of CRP were measured by the nephelometric method. We collected information regarding various laboratory tests including ESR, CBC with differential, D-dimer, fibrinogen, C3, C4, IL-6, etc. For most patients, we also collected data on age, gender, duration of CSU, presence of angioedema, activity (UAS at the time of blood sampling and for 7 days), quality of life (CU-Q2oL and/or DLQI), comorbidities and possible causes of CSU, and autologous serum skin test (ASST) response. The efficacy of second-generation antihistamines was evaluated on the day of blood collecting.

Results

One-third of CSU patients had elevated levels of CRP. Higher levels of CRP were associated with ASST positivity (P = 0.009) and arterial hypertension (P = 0.005), but not with other possible causes or comorbidities of CSU. C-reactive protein correlated with urticaria activity (P < .001), quality of life impairment (P = 0.026), and inflammatory and coagulation markers (P < .001). C-reactive protein levels were significantly higher in nonresponders to antihistamines as compared to responders (P < .001).

Conclusion

Elevated levels of CRP are common and relevant in CSU patients. The assessment of CRP levels may help to optimize the management of patients with CSU.

### Should C-reactive protein be a target of therapy? [^116EVoyT]. Diabetes Care (2011). Low credibility.

Multiple studies have demonstrated that elevated levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) are associated with increased cardiovascular (CV) risk. Newer CV risk stratification strategies incorporating hs-CRP (e.g. Reynolds Risk Score) have also been shown to improve risk stratification better than algorithms incorporating only traditional risk factors. There is also evidence from several landmark statin trials that on-treatment hs-CRP levels predict the likelihood of CV events. Although there is increasing evidence that CRP may be directly involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, the question of whether reduction in CRP levels and/or its associated downstream effects will provide novel therapeutic avenues to reduce CV risk requires further investigation.

CV diseases are the number one cause of mortality worldwide. Recent efforts directed at primary prevention of atherosclerosis have significantly reduced the incidence of initial clinical presentation of atherosclerosis. It is well established that patients with known diabetes or other traditional CV risk factors have an increased risk of atherosclerosis. Nonetheless, 15–20% of major CV events occur in patients with no major traditional CV risk factors. As a result, recent preventive efforts have been directed at finding newer, nontraditional, biomarkers to improve risk stratification, particularly in otherwise apparently low-risk individuals.

hs-CRP, previously considered to be an indicator of systemic inflammation, has recently received much attention in the scientific literature, not only as a potential marker of increased atherosclerotic risk, but also as a potential target of therapy for the prevention of atherosclerotic CV disease. In this review, we discuss whether hs-CRP should indeed be a target for therapy in the prevention of CV disease as well as other potential clinical implications related to hs-CRP.

Interleukin-6 inhibitors — tocilizumab in hospitalized adults with progressive severe or critical COVID-19: Among hospitalized adults with progressive severe or critical COVID-19 who have elevated markers of systemic inflammation, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) guideline panel suggests tocilizumab in addition to standard of care (i.e., steroids) rather than standard of care alone. (Conditional recommendation†, Low certainty of evidence). Patients, particularly those who respond to steroids alone, who put a high value on avoiding possible adverse events of tocilizumab and a low value on the uncertain mortality reduction, would reasonably decline tocilizumab. In the largest trial on the treatment of tocilizumab, criterion for systemic inflammation was defined as CRP ≥ 75 mg/L.

### Sequential C-reactive protein measurements in patients with serious infections: does it help? [^117Rowvf]. Critical Care (2012). Low credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP) is a marker of inflammation traditionally used as a complementary tool to support the clinical diagnosis and as a marker of severity of disease. CRP is an acute-phase protein synthesized by the liver after stimulus by cytokines and its serum levels increase markedly within hours after the onset of infection, inflammation or tissue injury. Dynamic serial measurement of CRP has been widely used to help therapeutic decision-making. Decreasing plasma concentrations of this biomarker have been used as an indicator for resolution of infection or sepsis.

### Diagnostic value of procalcitonin in transplant patients receiving immunosuppressant drugs: a retrospective electronic medical record-based analysis [^112z6AFD]. American Journal of Clinical Pathology (2021). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To evaluate concentrations of procalcitonin (PCT) in transplant recipients receiving immunosuppressive therapy compared with nonimmunosuppressed patients.

Methods

We analyzed a data set of 9,500 inpatient encounters to compare levels of PCT and other biomarkers of infection (C-reactive protein [CRP], WBC count, and absolute neutrophil count [ANC]) between immunosuppressed and nonimmunosuppressed cohorts. We also assessed the correlation between PCT and clinical variables in immunosuppressed patients.

Results

Patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs had significantly higher levels of maximal and minimal PCT compared with the nonimmunosuppressed patients (P < .0001 and P = 0.0019, respectively). However, CRP levels, WBC count, and ANC were significantly lower in immunosuppressed patients compared with the nonimmunosuppressed patients (P = 0.0003, P < .0019, and P = 0.0001, respectively).

Conclusions

Our results from real-world data demonstrated that PCT dynamics remain intact despite immunosuppressive therapy, in contrast to other biomarkers such as CRP, WBC, and ANC. In addition, higher PCT levels are associated with systemic infections and reflect disease severity.

### Guidance for assessment of the inflammation etiologic criterion for the GLIM diagnosis of malnutrition: a modified Delphi approach [^115REQ6Y]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

GLIM malnutrition — inflammation laboratory markers (statement 5) indicate that use of C-reactive protein (CRP) is recommended to support the inflammation criterion, with unanimous panel agreement. CRP has a half-life of 19 h, levels may be reduced in advanced liver disease, increased in end-stage kidney disease, and reduced with immunosuppressive conditions or therapies; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, magnesium supplements, or statins may lower CRP levels. Serum albumin lacks validity for diagnosing malnutrition in inflammatory settings, recovers slowly with a half-life of 3 weeks, yet if albumin is low and CRP elevated, inflammatory activity is highly likely.

### Systemic inflammation is associated with future risk of fatal infection: an observational cohort study [^116qCeFq]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

It is also important to interpret our work in the context of some limitations. First, the observational design precludes us from inferring causality in the association between systemic inflammation and infection death. Second, we have no data on the use of immunosuppressive anti-inflammatory therapies beyond the point of study enrollment, or indeed the lifetime doses of these. This is important because some people with undiagnosed inflammatory disorders, either at baseline or emerging during follow-up, may have later commenced these therapies, which are known to increase the risk of infection death. Moreover, lifetime dose of some immunosuppressive agents is associated with increased risk of infection and cardiovascular events. Hence, our adjusted IRR data may overestimate the association between elevated CRP and some causes of death. However, a relatively small proportion of the general population is prescribed such therapy, so our inability to account for incident use is unlikely to substantially diminish our estimates. Our analysis is similarly limited by only having access to CRP and covariate data at baseline. Finally, it is important to note that CRP defines only one facet of inflammation and may not be the optimal biomarker to define or understand this issue; hence, future studies should explore other markers.

### Utility of procalcitonin concentration in the evaluation of patients with malignant diseases and elevated C-reactive protein plasma concentrations [^112okvpw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Elevated plasma concentrations of the C-reactive protein (CRP) are frequently found in patients with malignant diseases. Discrimination between infection and noninfectious acute-phase reactions is essential for therapeutic decisions.

Methods

Because increased procalcitonin (PCT) concentrations have been described predominantly in patients with a systemic infection, PCT plasma concentrations were measured prospectively in 111 patients with a hemato-oncological condition with a CRP concentration > 8 mg/L.

Results

Documented cases of infection were identified in 42 patients, 39 patients had unexplained fever, and 30 patients had no signs of infection. Twenty patients in the latter group were classified as having an elevated CRP concentration caused by a high tumor load (tumor group), and 8 had elevated concentrations that were drug related (drug group). Median CRP concentrations did not differ significantly between groups of patients with and without infection. PCT concentrations were higher in patients with an infection than in patients without an infection and were within the normal range in all patients in the drug and tumor groups. As shown by receiver operating characteristic analysis, PCT concentration was a significant discriminator between having and not having infection, having infection and being in the tumor group, and having infection and being in the drug group. In contrast, CRP concentration was only a predictor of being in the drug group, when the cut-off point was set at 85.1 mg/L, which limited its clinical applicability.

Conclusions

PCT concentration contributes significantly to the differential diagnosis for elevated CRP concentrations in patients with hemato-oncological conditions and facilitates therapeutic decisions.

### Induction of procalcitonin in liver transplant patients treated with anti-thymocyte globulin [^113vFXo3]. Critical Care (2007). Low credibility.

Introduction

At the beginning of the '90s, it was discovered that elevated levels of serum procalcitonin (PCT) were closely related to the infectious etiology of systemic inflammatory response. Its role as a marker of infectious inflammation was reported repeatedly, and today PCT is assessed as a sensitive and specific marker of severe bacterial inflammation.

The last meta-analysis established that PCT is a more sensitive and specific parameter for the evidence of systemic bacterial infection than C-reactive protein (CRP). An increased PCT level over the course of the first 24 hours is an independent predictor of all-cause mortality in a 90-day follow-up period.

In patients undergoing organ transplantations, markers allowing the differentiation between infectious complications and rejection are of major clinical importance. Elevated PCT levels have been detected in patients following organ transplantation in a number of studies. Mild PCT elevation can be a marker of surgical trauma. In some studies, PCT was evaluated for its sensitivity in distinguishing between acute rejection and infection. Highly elevated PCT levels were described in patients having undergone immunosuppressive therapy. All patients were post-liver or post-kidney transplantation and were without the presence of systemic bacterial infection.

The aims of the present study were (a) to investigate serum levels of PCT and CRP in the perioperative and postoperative periods in patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTx) and receiving different perioperative inductive immunosuppressive therapy, (b) to address the possible molecular relationship between the liver transplantation with conjunctive immunotherapy and PCT production, and (c) toevaluate our results in patients undergoing liver resection without immunosuppressive therapy.

### Guidance for assessment of the inflammation etiologic criterion for the GLIM diagnosis of malnutrition: a modified Delphi approach [^115Gemak]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2024). High credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP) thresholds for inflammation — interpretation and use are as follows: CRP levels of 3.0–9.9 mg/L are consistent with mild inflammation, levels of 10–50 mg/L are consistent with moderate inflammation, and levels of > 50 mg/L are consistent with severe inflammation; these thresholds are provided to help support identification of individuals with inflammatory diseases and conditions, not to assess risk for development of disease. Serial CRP measures can be helpful when the status or contribution of inflammation is unclear in the setting of a chronic condition, and measurement of CRP trends can be helpful, because a single normal CRP value does not exclude the possible contribution of an inflammatory component; whenever possible, the opportunity to make use of CRP test results that have been ordered for other medical purposes is encouraged.

### BAL neutrophils, serum procalcitonin, and C-reactive protein to predict bacterial infection in the immunocompromised host [^116X8HCJ]. Chest (2007). Low credibility.

Background

Bacterial pulmonary infection is a common life-threatening complication in immunocompromised patients. The results of BAL cultures are not immediately available, and their microbiological yield might be limited by empiric antibiotic prescriptions. We evaluated clinical signs and symptoms, leukocyte counts, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, procalcitonin levels, and BAL fluid neutrophil percentages as potential markers for bacterial infection in a cohort of immunocompromised patients with pulmonary complications.

Methods

One hundred seven consecutive patients who had been referred for bronchoscopy due to suspected pulmonary infection were included in this study. Based on clinical, laboratory, radiologic, microbiological, and histologic results, patients were classified as having proven bacterial infection (n = 27), possible bacterial infection (n = 11), and no bacterial infection (n = 69).

Results

Most common underlying conditions were hematologic malignancy (n = 62) and solid organ transplantation (n = 20). Clinical parameters were similar in patients with and without bacterial infection (difference was not significant). The percentage of BAL fluid neutrophils had the highest area under the curve (0.818; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.700 to 0.935; p < 0.001), followed by absolute neutrophil counts (0.797; 95% CI, 0.678 to 0.916; p < 0.001), procalcitonin level (0.746; 95% CI, 0.602 to 0.889; p = 0.001), and CRP level (0.688; 95% CI, 0.555 to 0.821; p = 0.015) to predict proven bacterial infection (in opposition to no or possible bacterial infection) in the receiver operating characteristic analysis. Conversely, neither infiltrates (p = 0.123) nor leukocyte counts (p = 0.429) were useful in diagnosing bacterial infection. The percentage of BAL fluid neutrophils and procalcitonin level were independent predictors of bacterial infection in the multivariate regression.

Conclusions

Neutrophil percentage in BAL fluid, procalcitonin level, and CRP level might be potentially useful to differentiate bacterial infection from nonbacterial conditions in immunocompromised hosts with pulmonary complications.

### Pre-treatment blood inflammatory markers as predictors of systemic infection during induction chemotherapy: results of an exploratory study in patients with acute myeloid leukemia [^117CuZU9]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the role of C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin blood levels in predicting the incidence of systemic infection among adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) treated with induction chemotherapy.

Methods

Adult patients with newly diagnosed AML who were initially treated with conventional 3+7 induction chemotherapy within 5 days of their diagnosis were included. Patients with previous cytotoxic chemotherapy < 3 years, acute promyelocytic leukemia diagnosis, human immunodeficiency virus infection, or significant systemic infection at the time of diagnosis were excluded. Patients were treated with an institutional policy of substantial identity with negligible differences regarding supportive care.

Results

Among 110 patients (median age 54.5 years), 39 infectious events in 38 patients were reported, along with 21 episodes of infectious treatment-related mortality (TRM; 19.1%). Elevated pre-treatment CRP (p = 0.032) and ferritin (p = 0.002) were related to the incidence of systemic infection. The degree of increase of blood CRP and ferritin level was correlated with the extent of leukocytosis. However, patients with elevated inflammatory markers above normal range had increased risk of infection irrespective of whether they had leukocytosis or not, suggesting that expansion of leukemic blast is another factor affecting the elevation of the markers independent to infection propensity and therefore the magnitude of the elevation does not quantitatively predict the risk of infection.

Conclusions

Modest elevation of baseline blood inflammatory markers above the normal range could be an indicator for predicting the incidence of systemic infection in patients with AML.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for evaluating new fever in adult patients in the ICU [^117SdwAz]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

Procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) in adult ICU patients are discussed for diagnostic accuracy and antibiotic stewardship. The diagnostic accuracy and specificity of PCT are higher than those of CRP, although further studies are needed to define the optimal cutoff points for PCT and CRP and the diagnostic indexes in different disease stages. Several RCTs have demonstrated that PCT-based algorithms safely reduce antibiotic use in stable, low-risk patients with respiratory infections, and in ICU patients with suspected sepsis, clinicians should not initially withhold antibiotics, but PCT levels of less than 0.5 μg/L or levels that decrease by greater than or equal to 80% from peak levels may guide antibiotic discontinuation once patients stabilize. The Stop Antibiotics on Procalcitonin Guidance Study demonstrated a reduction in both antibiotic exposure and mortality in critically ill patients, and a meta-analysis of 11 RCTs involving 4,482 patients reported that PCT-guided antibiotic treatment in ICU patients with infection and sepsis patients resulted in improved survival and lower antibiotic treatment duration. The latest and largest systematic review and meta-analysis to date of 16 studies and greater than5000 patients showed that PCT-guided antibiotic discontinuation appeared to decrease antibiotic utilization by 1 day and improve mortality, but support for their findings was tempered by low-certainty evidence and the majority of the PCT trials excluded severely immunocompromised patients. In summary, PCT and CRP provide only supportive and complementary information to clinical assessment, and decisions on initiating, altering, or discontinuing antimicrobial therapy should not be made solely based on changes in PCT or CRP levels.

### Development and validation of prediction scores for the outcome associated with persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome among patients with trauma [^111Baosx]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Discussion

We developed a new scoring system and named the ACIDS score, comprising a maximum CRP value > 15 mg/dL, a minimum albumin < 2.5 g/dL, and an episode of infection during the 7 days from admission. Those variables indicated the presence of PICS and could predict poor outcomes associated with PICS among patients with trauma. Based on the results, the scores of 1, 2, and 3 could be interpreted as 'low risk', 'intermediate risk', and 'high risk' of PICS-related outcomes, respectively.

Severe tissue injury releases damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), activates the innate immune response and increases the production of proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Patients with PICS are characterized to have persistent presence of DAMPs and acute inflammatory response.CRP is produced in response to the stimulation of interleukin-6. Circulating CRP concentration reflects the intensity of ongoing inflammation. Previous studies have reported that a higher CRP level was a diagnostic marker of PICS. Recently, Ingels et al reported that higher CRP levels on day 3 among critically ill patients were associated with more infections and longer ICU stays. It suggests that early elevation of CRP levels reflects a severe immune response after injury. The enhanced immune response presumably increases susceptibility to infection, leading to further inflammation. The pathophysiology supports that CRP levels in the early phase after injury could be the surrogate markers of the PICS presence. Interestingly, Ingels et al also demonstrated that higher CRP levels were associated with the late initiation of nutrition support but not with the serum concentration of cytokines. Thus, CRP may be affected by nutrient deficits as well as immune responses, although this is beyond the scope of the present study.

### Sepsis in patients who are immunocompromised: diagnostic challenges and future therapies [^115UG2gn]. The Lancet: Respiratory Medicine (2025). High credibility.

Sepsis is a life-threatening, dysregulated host response to infection. Immunosuppression is a risk factor for infections and sepsis. However, the specific immune derangements elevating the risk for infections and sepsis remain unclear in the individual patient, raising the question of whether a general state of immunosuppression exists. In this Review, we explore the relationship between immunosuppression and sepsis, detailing the definitions, causes, and clinical implications. We address the effect of primary immunodeficiencies, acquired conditions, and drugs on the risk of infection and the development of sepsis. Patients with sepsis who are immunocompromised often present with atypical symptoms and diagnostic test results can differ, making early recognition difficult. Future perspectives entail novel biomarkers to improve early sepsis detection and tailored treatments to modulate immune function. Including patients who are immunocompromised in clinical trials is crucial to enhance the relevance of research findings and improve treatment strategies for this vulnerable population.

### Evaluation of procalcitonin, neopterin, C-reactive protein, IL-6 and IL-8 as a diagnostic marker of infection in patients with febrile neutropenia [^112CFEUi]. Leukemia & Lymphoma (2008). Low credibility.

Infectious complications in neutropenic patients are a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Clinical signs are unspecific and fever can be attributed to other causes. Inflammatory biomarkers have emerged as potentially useful in diagnosis of bacterial and fungal infection. Levels of several biomarkers were measured in patients with hematological malignancy at diagnosis and at the beginning of neutropenia due to cytostatic treatment or after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and daily until 6 days after presenting fever. Procalcitonin (PCT) and neopterin levels were not elevated at diagnosis or at the beginning of neutropenia. C-reactive protein (CRP) was moderately elevated. PCT levels were significantly higher in patients with Gram-negative bacteremia at 24–48 h after the onset of fever. Patients with probable fungal infection presented elevated PCT values when fever persisted for more than 4–5 days. CRP was more sensitive to predict bacteremia (both Gram-positive and Gram-negative) but the specificity was low. Neither neopterin, IL-6 nor IL-8 presented significant differences according to the origin or etiology of fever. Since it showed a high negative predictive value of Gram-negative bacteremia, clinical prediction rules that attempt to predict a high risk of severe infection might be improved by including measurement of PCT.

### C-reactive protein level at 2 weeks following initiation of infliximab induction therapy predicts outcomes in patients with ulcerative colitis: a 3 year follow-up study [^111BDNQs]. BMC Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

Background

The evolution of knowledge on the involvement of certain cytokines, notably tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α in the immunopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has stimulated the development of anti-TNF antibodies as novel biologics for the treatment of IBD. In deed, the efficacy of biologics like infliximab (IFX) in both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) has led to a significant change in IBD treatment algorithms. However, studies on the role of TNF-α in the exacerbation of IBD have shown a greater focus on CD than on UC. Nonetheless, an increased TNF-α level in the sera, stool, and colonic mucosa of patients with active UC has been reported. Additionally, there are inconsistent efficacy outcomes for IFX in patients with UC refractory to corticosteroids, or to immunosuppressants.

Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) is the most widely studied acute phase protein in inflammatory diseases and is found to have the best overall performance among laboratory markers. CRP level correlates well with disease activity in patients with CD and also in patients with UC. The production of CRP is almost exclusively in the liver by the hepatocytes as part of an acute phase reaction in response to interleukin (IL)-6, TNF-α or IL-1β released from the site of inflammation. Additionally, a marked reduction in the level of CRP within 72 h of IFX infusion indirectly points to an effect on the cytokine profile.

Recently, several investigators have shown interest in understanding biomarkers of clinical response to IFX including CRP levels in CD patients. However, their results were marred by inconsistencies; a high CRP level at baseline was thought to predict response to IFX, while a low CRP level at baseline was associated with sustained response. Additionally, the reported cut-off level for CRP was different in each study. Further, in patients with CD or with UC, CRP levels drop to normal value after completion of IFX induction therapy and has been considered to predict sustained remission. However, to our knowledge, prediction of IFX responders, partial-responders or non-responders following IFX induction therapy, especially at an early stage of induction therapy has not been well investigated. With this in mind, the present study was undertaken to understand the predictive value of serum CRP at week 2 during induction therapy in IFX naïve patients with an active flare of UC. Patients were then followed up over a 3 year period to observe the association of clinical outcome with CRP level 2 weeks after the initiation of IFX induction therapy.

### COVID-19-induced hyperinflammation, immunosuppression, recovery and survival: how causal inference may help draw robust conclusions [^113th7ro]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion

The data indicate that, in comparison with period 1, the immunosuppressive therapy administered to patients in period 2 has increased the 14-day clinical improvement rate over and above the level that could be expected based on the prognostic advantages that patients in period 2 (apparently) had. Similar effects were found for (30-day and 90-day) survival. It was possible to decompose the period effect (direct) from the CRP-mediated effect (indirect) by using mediation analysis. The period effect includes non-CRP-related improvements in management over time, such as better ventilatory support techniques, more focus on anticoagulation, and putatively a better natural prognosis. While it cannot be entirely excluded that these improvements have also had some impact on CRP response, it is hard to believe that they could reduce baseline CRP levels by more than 80% within 13 days. The estimate of the immunosuppressive treatment effect is nevertheless conservative. It is possible that part of the specific effect by immunosuppressive treatment was not captured by us as indirect effect. As said, the threshold of 80% improvement in CRP before a CRP response was counted as present was quite high, and it cannot be excluded that some patients with a beneficial outcome due to immunosuppressive treatment had in reality a CRP response slightly lower than 80%. If true, this would mean that the real contribution of immunosuppressive therapy is even higher than estimated by us.

### Biomarker-guided individualization of antibiotic therapy [^114G8yLH]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

C‐reactive protein

C‐reactive protein (CRP) is a hepatic acute phase protein playing a crucial role in the innate host defense by activating the complement system, promoting phagocytosis of pathogens. Admission levels of CRP do not predict outcome in sepsis and RTIs, but CRP levels in patients showing a clinical response to antibiotics decreased faster, or lower levels after therapy.

Interleukin‐6

Interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) is a cytokine produced by immune cells and stromal cells and is involved in inflammation. IL‐6 plays a pivotal role in orchestrating the immune response to infection. This pleiotropic cytokine has both pro‐inflammatory and anti‐inflammatory effects, and is involved in neutrophil infiltration, activation, and proliferation of T‐cells and B‐cells, and acute phase response. IL‐6 is of potential interest as a biomarker in sepsis to reflect disease severity. Increased IL‐6 levels have been associated with increased mortality in patients with sepsis.

Presepsin

Presepsin is a cleavage product of the CD14 membrane coreceptor involved in pathogen recognition and initiation of the innate immune response, and is involved in regulation of bacterial phagocytosis. Presepsin is a rapidly responding biomarker for bacterial and fungal infections. Baseline presepsin levels have been shown to predict mortality, and correlate with sepsis disease severity. Furthermore, the dynamic time course of presepsin also predicts survival.

Biomarker dynamics

The majority of clinically used immune response biomarker studies have considered primarily static threshold concentrations to inform clinical decision making. Less attention has been given to the full dynamics of immune response biomarkers for evaluation of treatment efficacy. To guide and optimize antibiotic treatment in individual patients, immune response biomarkers should ideally reflect underlying current pathogen load (Figure 3a), which is typically not feasible to measure directly. Consequently, characterization of the onset and decline of biomarkers in response to infectious challenges is an important step toward their interpretation in context of antibiotic treatment response. Biomarkers with a delayed onset or prolonged half‐life therefore reflect poorly the current state of infection. Substantial differences exist between the kinetic properties of biomarkers (Table 2), and kinetic properties should be considered when they are investigated as antibiotic treatment response biomarkers to evaluate treatment response (Figure 3b).

Figure 3
Key characteristics of treatment response biomarkers. To enable the assessment of treatment response biomarker should (a) be rapidly induced and have a relatively short half‐life to satisfactory follow the course of infection, (b) be able to stratify treatment response, and (c) have a characterized drug exposure‐response relationship.

### Relationship between baseline and early changes in C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 levels and clinical response to tocilizumab in rheumatoid arthritis [^112hxpvJ]. Arthritis Care & Research (2016). Low credibility.

Although identifying predictive biomarkers is a desirable endeavor, equally important is the consideration of how an individual drug can be differentiated according to its mechanism of action 8. One might argue that recognizing the nonpredictive nature of otherwise "obvious" targets is imperative in order to avoid unnecessary expense and lost time (time during which a patient's disease could progress). The objective of this brief report is to describe the relevance of measuring IL‐6 and CRP levels in the context of patient selection and clinical response prediction for TCZ therapy.

### Insights into the use of C-reactive protein as a diagnostic index of disease severity in COVID-19 infections [^111Er4Xm]. The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene (2020). Medium credibility.

In normal healthy individuals, baseline CRP levels in blood are reported to be less than 10 μg/mL, with measured CRP below this threshold described as "high sensitivity CRP" values. In situations of tissue trauma or disease, CRP blood levels can increase 10- to 100-fold within 10–72 hours of the inciting cause (i.e. described as "conventional CRP" values), with higher levels correlating with disease severity. Although levels between 10 and 50 μg/mL are diagnostic of an ongoing inflammatory response that can be either acute or chronic, CRP levels above 100 μg/mL in any disease are diagnostic of fulminant inflammation and are associated with poor disease prognosis. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services guidelines for interpreting the diagnostic significance of CRP describe the difference between conventional and high sensitivity values and provides guidance only for conventional CRP levels.

C-reactive protein levels have been used to differentiate viral from bacterial infections. In uncomplicated viral infections, CRP levels increase minimally to ∼ 20 μg/mL, whereas in bacterial infections, levels increase to > 40 μg/mL. These levels reflect on the degree of tissue involvement and can help diagnose confounding complications. Zhang et al.reported in 140 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, CRP levels varied from 28.7 μg/mL in non-severe disease (n = 82; range, 9.5–52.1 μg/mL) to 47.6 μg/mL in severe disease (n = 56; range, 20.6–87.1 μg/mL) (see Table 1). In previously studied respiratory viral infections, patients infected with the avian flu strain H7N9 (that emerged in 2013) had mean CRP levels of 84.0 μg/mL. Of note, mean CRP levels in patients who died were 129.6 μg/mL compared with 63.0 μg/mL in those who survived. Higher CRP levels in viral infections may be diagnostic of a concurrent bacterial infection and have been used to help decide whether infected patients should be placed on antibiotic therapy. –

### COVID-19-induced hyperinflammation, immunosuppression, recovery and survival: how causal inference may help draw robust conclusions [^116JQRoi]. RMD Open (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The CHIC study (COVID-19 High-intensity Immunosuppression in Cytokine storm syndrome) is a quasi-experimental treatment study exploring immunosuppressive treatment versus supportive treatment only in patients with COVID-19 with life-threatening hyperinflammation. Causal inference provides a means of investigating causality in non-randomised experiments. Here we report 14-day improvement as well as 30-day and 90-day mortality.

Patients and Methods

The first 86 patients (period 1) received optimal supportive care only; the second 86 patients (period 2) received methylprednisolone and (if necessary) tocilizumab, in addition to optimal supportive care. The main outcomes were 14-day clinical improvement and 30-day and 90-day survival. An 80% decline in C reactive protein (CRP) was recorded on or before day 13 (CRP > 100mg/L was an inclusion criterion). Non-linear mediation analysis was performed to decompose CRP-mediated effects of immunosuppression (defined as natural indirect effects) and non-CRP-mediated effects attributable to natural prognostic differences between periods (defined as natural direct effects).

Results

The natural direct (non-CRP-mediated) effects for period 2 versus period 1 showed an OR of 1.38 (38% better) for 14-day improvement and an OR of 1.16 (16% better) for 30-day and 90-day survival. The natural indirect (CRP-mediated) effects for period 2 showed an OR of 2.27 (127% better) for 14-day improvement, an OR of 1.60 (60% better) for 30-day survival and an OR of 1.49 (49% better) for 90-day survival. The number needed to treat was 5 for 14-day improvement, 9 for survival on day 30, and 10 for survival on day 90.

Conclusion

Causal inference with non-linear mediation analysis further substantiates the claim that a brief but intensive treatment with immunosuppressants in patients with COVID-19 and systemic hyperinflammation adds to rapid recovery and saves lives. Causal inference is an alternative to conventional trial analysis, when randomised controlled trials are considered unethical, unfeasible or impracticable.

### C-reactive protein and bacterial infection in cirrhosis [^1116koaW]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2014). Low credibility.

In the general population, C-reactive protein (CRP) level increases in the presence of acute or chronic inflammation and infections. In patients with cirrhosis, the basal level is higher than in patients without cirrhosis, due to chronic hepatic and other inflammation, but when infection occurs the more severe the underlying liver dysfunction, the lower the increase in CRP. Therefore, the predictive power of CRP for infection and prognosis is weak in patients with decompensated/advanced cirrhosis and in the intensive care setting. However, higher CRP and also persistently elevated CRP levels can help identify patients with a higher short-term risk of mortality.

### Early and significant reduction in C-reactive protein levels after corticosteroid therapy is associated with reduced mortality in patients with COVID-19 [^117MY8BD]. Journal of Hospital Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Corticosteroids may be beneficial in a subset of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), but predictors of therapeutic response remain unknown. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a routinely measured biomarker, and reduction in its levels after initiation of therapy may predict inpatient mortality.

Methods

In this retrospective cohort study, the charts of patients who were admitted to Montefiore Medical Center between March 10, 2020, and May 2, 2020 for the management of COVID-19 were examined. Of all patients who met inclusion criteria, patients who received corticosteroid treatment were categorized as CRP responders (≥ 50% CRP level reduction) and CRP nonresponders (< 50% CRP level reduction) based on change in CRP within 72 hours of corticosteroid treatment initiation. The outcomes of interest were two-fold: (1) CRP response after treatment with corticosteroid, and (2) differences in mortality among patients with CRP response compared those without.

Results

Of 2,707 patients admitted during the study period, 324 received corticosteroid treatment. Of patients who received corticosteroid treatment, CRP responders had reduced risk of death compared with risk among CRP nonresponders (25.2% vs 47.8%; unadjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.37; 95% CI, 0.21–0.65; P < .001). This effect remained strong and significant after adjustment for potential confounders (adjusted OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.14–0.54; P < .001).

Conclusion

Reduction in CRP by 50% or more within 72 hours of initiating corticosteroid therapy potentially predicts inpatient mortality. This may serve as an early biomarker of response to corticosteroid therapy in patients with COVID-19.

### Systemic inflammation is associated with future risk of fatal infection: an observational cohort study [^116cw2b3]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2022). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, we show that elevated CRP is common in people with diverse chronic diseases and accumulates with multimorbidity. Irrespective of the threshold chosen, CRP defines a group of people at particularly increased relative risk of infection death. Moreover, this observation persisted in analyses restricted to the majority of comorbidities we studied, indicating that it is broadly relevant. This suggests that using CRP as a biomarker to identify people who may benefit from potent anti-inflammatory therapies also selects a population at increased risk of fatal infection, in keeping with recent clinical trial data in people with atherosclerosis. This raises the question of whether more could be done to prevent infection, for example by improving suboptimal uptake of existing vaccination strategies, before commencing anti-inflammatory therapy. In the future, researchers should aim to understand the immune responses to pathogens in people with systemic inflammation, which may help to develop safer anti-inflammatory therapies for chronic disease and target their use to people most likely to obtain net benefit.

### Inflammatory response associated with pulmonary complications in non-HIV immunocompromised patients [^114jxAGp]. Thorax (2004). Low credibility.

Background

A study was undertaken to evaluate the local and systemic inflammatory response associated with pulmonary complications in immunocompromised patients and potential implications regarding severity and prognosis.

Methods

Levels of different inflammatory mediators were measured in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and serum on days 1 and 4 after the identification of the pulmonary complication in 127 patients with different immunosuppressive conditions.

Results

Pulmonary complications were characterised by a high percentage of neutrophils and increased levels of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and IL-10 in the BAL fluid and high serum levels of TNF-alpha, IL-6, and plasma C-reactive protein (CRP). The inflammatory response was similar in the different groups of immunocompromised patients evaluated. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines were higher in patients with pulmonary infections, particularly those of bacterial aetiology. Patients with a more severe pulmonary infection had a more intense local and systemic inflammatory response. A BAL fluid IL-6 level of > 40 pg/ml was an independent predictor of mortality (OR 4.65, 95% CI 1.3 to 16.1), together with a need for mechanical ventilation (OR 13.5, 95% CI 3.2 to 57.3). Patients who died had persistently high levels of CRP on day 4.

Conclusions

The evaluation of the inflammatory response, particularly the determination of IL-6 levels in the BAL fluid and CRP in the serum, may be useful for deciding the appropriate management of pulmonary complications in immunocompromised patients.

### Risk factors, biomarkers, and mechanisms for persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome (PICS): a systematic review and meta-analysis [^113ywbpz]. British Journal of Anaesthesia (2024). Medium credibility.

Complications

Five out of six studies reported PICS to be associated with longer ICU LOS, but not hospital LOS (three studies). PICS was associated with a higher incidence of sepsis in three studies. Another study showed no difference between PICS and non-PICS for early sepsis (75.5% vs 60.0%, P = 0.08) but a higher incidence of late sepsis (after day 7 of admission). One study reported a higher incidence of ICU acquired infection with PICS, whereas another found no differences in secondary infections between groups. Two studies showed that PICS was associated with pneumonia, one with catheter-related bloodstream infections, and one showed no difference between infection sites.

PICS was associated with requiring mechanical ventilation in four studies. Three out of six studies reported conflicting incidences of renal replacement therapy (RRT): two studies demonstrated an association, whereas one study on patients with SLE did not. Similar conflicting relationships are seen with reported surgical procedures in two studies, one demonstrating a higher associationand one not. Infusion of blood products, specifically red blood cells, plasma, and platelets, was shown to be associated with PICS. No association between PICS and instigation of a massive transfusion protocol was seen in another study.

Blood results and biomarkers

Pooled analysis

Meta-analysis of pooled studies showed a 34.4 mg L −1 higher CRP (n = 2863; 95% CI 12.7–56.2 mg L −1; P < 0.01), a 4.4 g L −1 lower albumin (n = 2863, 95% CI 0.5–8.3 g L −1; P < 0.01), and a 0.36×10 9 L −1 lower lymphocyte count (n = 2810; 95% CI 0.25–0.47 ×10 9 L −1; P = 0.01) in the PICS compared with the non-PICS group (Fig. 3).

### Development and validation of prediction scores for the outcome associated with persistent inflammation, immunosuppression, and catabolism syndrome among patients with trauma [^11452iii]. Trauma Surgery & Acute Care Open (2023). Medium credibility.

Methods

Study design

A single-center retrospective cohort study for consecutive patients with trauma was conducted. The derivation cohort comprised patients admitted to the hospital between January 2012 and December 2015, whereas the validation cohort comprised those admitted between January 2016 and December 2018. This study complied with the Transparent Reporting of a Multivariable Prediction Model for Individual Prognosis or Diagnosis guidelines. The study was conducted in accordance with the ethical standards of the Helsinki Declaration. The need for informed consent was waived because of the retrospective nature of the study design.

Study participants

This study included adult injured patients who stayed in the ICU for > 7 days. Patients ≤ 15 years, transferred to the ICU from general wards, transferred from other hospitals, admitted to the ICU secondary to non-trauma causes, complicated with burns, implemented do-not-attempt-resuscitation orders within 14 days, and discharged from hospital by any cause, including 'early death', within 14 days were excluded. Moreover, patients with missing data on predictors and outcomes were excluded.

Data collection

Demographic, clinical, and physiological data were collected by medical chart reviews: age, gender, mechanism of trauma, vital signs on arrival at the hospital, coexisting medical condition, Injury Severity Score (ISS), Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS), days to start nutrition support, and undergoing treatment and organ support. To develop the model, readily available variables presenting PICS were selected. A maximum value of CRP and minimum value of albumin, and an episode of nosocomial infection over the 7 days were extracted as surrogate markers of inflammation, catabolism, and immunosuppression, respectively. Nosocomial infection was identified based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/National Healthcare Safety Network criteria. Regarding pneumonia, we omitted the evaluation of chest radiograph findings because interpreting them entailed the subjectivity and variability in patients receiving MV, especially those with chest injuries. Each infection also met the following criteria: infection occurred 48 hours after the admission; the microbiological pathogen was isolated from the culture of the suspected source; and the response to the treatment (eg, antibiotics or drainage) was confirmed by physicians. The treatment decision was based on the physician's discretion.

### Hypoalbuminemia: pathogenesis and clinical significance [^114LpzTy]. JPEN: Journal of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (2019). Medium credibility.

Other plasma proteins have also been promoted as markers of inflammation. C‐reactive protein (CRP) is a true acute‐phase protein rising within 10 hours to plasma levels > 100 mg/L after major surgery or acute sepsis. CRP is present in very low concentrations in healthy individuals but strongly upregulated, stimulated by IL‐6 and NO rising immediately after trauma or infection. There is a close inverse correlation between increases in CRP and decreases in serum albumin levels after 48 hours in well‐resuscitated septic or traumatized patients. Thereafter, CRP drops quickly after 3–4 days to low, but still modestly increased, levels if the proinflammatory phase is successful. 147 In this phase, plasma CRP level is primarily an indicator of the severity of the primary insult, initiating innate immunity to clear tissue debris and microorganisms and their products. 148 Thereafter, in the anti‐inflammatory phase, CRP is neither a precise indicator of the severity of the metabolic response, nor a very precise indicator of whether there is improvement or deterioration of the clinical state. 147 Only in the presence of renewed or unrelenting tissue damage, CRP will steeply increase or remain strongly elevated. Plasma albumin is a constitutive protein, required in health and disease. After an initial steep drop, plasma albumin levels continue to decrease modestly until 3–7 days after operation, when they start to increase slowly in the case of clinical recovery. 4 Normal levels may only be reached after 3–4 months, reflecting the anti‐inflammatory phase promoting wound healing and tissue rebuilding and remodelling.

### Advocating for the recognition of underlying immunosuppression in critical illness [^111DHsn3]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

This manuscript underscores the critical need for individualised management strategies in the care of immunocompromised patients in the ICU. By introducing a graded classification of immunosuppression and exploring its clinical implications, we aim to provide a framework for tailoring therapeutic interventions. Future research should focus on validating these grading systems and identifying precise biomarkers to guide clinical decision-making. The ultimate goal is to achieve a balance between adequate immune suppression and infection prevention. Open questions remain, such as determining optimal timing and thresholds for immune interventions and the long-term outcomes of personalised therapies.

Introduction

In the past 15 years, therapeutic options for patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have grown extensively; 9 biologic therapies and 1 novel oral medication have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, allowing physicians and patients more choices for disease control. However, because of the heterogeneity of RA and differences in the targeted mechanisms of action of the drugs, not every patient will respond initially or maintain response to a given therapy. The American College of Rheumatology and the European League Against Rheumatism recommend treat‐to‐target as a standard of care 1, 2, 3. Implicit in this approach is the maintenance of tight disease control, influenced by regular assessments of disease activity, which may require switching therapies. At the same time, interest has been growing in identifying biomarkers to help clinicians stratify patients and match them to personalized, efficacious treatment options 4.

Significance & Innovations

Given the targeted nature of modern medicines, the rheumatologist is tempted to attribute prognostic relevance to serum markers thought to be associated with disease. However, given the complexity of the immunologic networks that drive RA, limited progress has been made in identifying generalized or treatment‐specific biomarkers. Progress has also been restricted by the intrinsic impact of a treatment's specific mechanism of action. Wang et al 5 attempted to address these constraints by investigating the molecular pathway of the target of tocilizumab (TCZ) therapy but found that the variation in pathway activity, as measured in blood, may not be a strong predictor of treatment response in RA.

TCZ is a recombinant, humanized, anti–human monoclonal antibody directed against the soluble interleukin‐6 receptor (sIL‐6R) and the membrane‐bound IL‐6 receptor (mIL‐6R). IL‐6 is a proinflammatory, multifunctional cytokine produced by a variety of cell types and involved in diverse physiologic and immunologic processes. Moreover, elevated tissue and serum levels of IL‐6 have been implicated in the pathology of several inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, including RA. TCZ has been shown to inhibit sIL‐6R– and mIL‐6R–mediated signaling 6. Inhibition of this signaling is associated with the rapid reduction of acute‐phase reactants, such as C‐reactive protein (CRP) levels, and the elevation of serum IL‐6 levels after TCZ dosing 7.

### Persistently elevated C-reactive protein level in the first year of antiretroviral therapy, despite virologic suppression, is associated with HIV disease progression in resource-constrained settings [^1127tBUj]. The Journal of Infectious Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

A case-cohort analysis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) was performed within a multicountry randomized trial (PEARLS) to assess the prevalence of persistently elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, based on serial measurements of CRP levels, and their association with HIV clinical failure. A persistently elevated CRP level in plasma (defined as ≥ 5 mg/L at both baseline and 24 weeks after ART initiation) was observed in 50 of 205 individuals (24%). A persistently elevated CRP level but not an elevated CRP level only at a single time point was independently associated with increased clinical failure, compared with a persistently low CRP level, despite achievement of virologic suppression. Serial monitoring of CRP levels could identify individuals who are at highest risk of HIV progression and may benefit from future adjunct antiinflammatory therapies.

### Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for evaluating new fever in adult patients in the ICU [^112YoH1B]. Critical Care Medicine (2023). High credibility.

C-reactive protein (CRP) in adult ICU patients — test characteristics and kinetics: Plasma CRP levels start to rise 12 — 24 hours after an acute inflammatory or infectious insult, reaching a maximum value after 48 hours. Levels of CRP are typically below 5 mg/L and the typical cutoff for CRP is 10 mg/L. Like PCT, results are available within minutes with point-of-care assays or within an hour with laboratory-based assays; laboratory assays are quantitative and suitable for serial monitoring. Unlike PCT, CRP concentrations can be affected by neutropenia, immunodeficiency, and use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.
