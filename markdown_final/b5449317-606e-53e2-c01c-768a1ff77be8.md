## Question

why do we need the BP 180/105

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why we need the BP 180/105 mmHg threshold and in what contexts it matters clinically. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about which scenarios actually use 180/105 and why. Then, I should verify the evidence base supporting those thresholds. Next, I will examine the pathophysiologic rationale for using those numbers rather than higher or lower targets. After that, I should review guideline evolution and any controversies. Finally, I will synthesize practical implications and clarify when 180/105 is not the right target, making sure I anchor each point to high-quality sources.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts where 180/105 is used, because I need to ensure we are not conflating different thresholds. The most prominent is acute ischemic stroke management around reperfusion therapies: pre-thrombolysis BP must be less than 185/110 mmHg, and for the first 24 hours after IV alteplase or endovascular therapy, BP should be maintained at or below 180/105 mmHg to mitigate hemorrhagic complications, which is consistently recommended in AHA/ASA and contemporary ACC/AHA guidance [^0795e665] [^10763db4] [^d26e5687]. Another context is perioperative risk stratification, where preoperative BP less than 180/110 mmHg is generally not a reason to delay surgery, whereas higher pressures prompt evaluation for target organ damage and risk mitigation, reflecting pragmatic risk balancing rather than a treatment target per se [^919004eb] [^34cd81fe]. Hold on, I should verify that I'm not mixing this with hypertensive emergency definitions; emergencies are typically defined at 180/120 mmHg with acute target organ injury, which is a different, higher threshold than 180/105, so I need to keep those separate in the discussion [^f062bcbf] [^82ca87a2].

> Next, I should review the evidence base for the stroke thresholds, because I need to ensure we are not overextending observational data. The 185/110 pre-tPA and 180/105 post-tPA targets originate from the RCT protocols of IV alteplase, which required these cutoffs for safety, and contemporary guidelines continue to endorse them based on those RCT entry criteria and observational signals linking higher BP and BP variability with increased symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage after thrombolysis, even though the exact inflection point is uncertain [^5ed9c360] [^a8f5909d] [^bbee1a33]. Wait, let me verify whether lower post-tPA targets help; ENCHANTED tested SBP 130–140 mmHg and did not show improved outcomes, reinforcing that 180/105 is a reasonable, evidence-aligned target for the first 24 hours rather than pushing lower by default [^5ed9c360] [^a8f5909d]. For endovascular therapy, the same 180/105 mmHg peri- and post-procedure target is recommended to balance reperfusion hemorrhage risk, again reflecting protocol standards from pivotal trials and guideline synthesis rather than randomized BP-target data per se [^0795e665] [^d2b43e42] [^10763db4].

> I will now examine the pathophysiologic rationale, because I need to ensure the threshold makes mechanistic sense. After successful reperfusion, the injured cerebrovascular bed loses normal autoregulation and becomes vulnerable to hyperperfusion, edema, and hemorrhage; maintaining BP at or below 180/105 mmHg reduces the risk of reperfusion hemorrhage and malignant edema while avoiding excessive hypotension that could compromise penumbral perfusion, which is why guidelines settled on this pragmatic upper bound rather than a single universal "normal" target [^0daf04ca] [^0795e665]. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; some protocols and studies explore even lower post-reperfusion targets like SBP less than 140 mmHg, but those are investigational or center-specific and not yet standard of care, so 180/105 remains the guideline-backed default pending stronger randomized evidence for lower targets [^d2b43e42] [^8895c7bd].

> Next, I should review guideline evolution and any controversies, because I need to ensure I'm not overstating consensus. Historically, the 180/105 post-tPA threshold was adopted directly from trial protocols and has persisted across AHA/ASA updates from 2018 to 2019 and into the 2025 ACC/AHA/AANP guideline, which continues to recommend maintaining BP at or below 180/105 mmHg for at least 24 hours after thrombolysis or endovascular therapy, citing the same RCT-derived safety rationale and observational hemorrhage risk data [^0795e665] [^10763db4] [^d26e5687]. But wait, what if we could safely go lower? ENCHANTED's neutral results temper enthusiasm for more aggressive early lowering, and ongoing uncertainty about optimal post-reperfusion targets is reflected in permissive language allowing consideration of lower goals in selected patients, particularly after successful reperfusion, while acknowledging the evidence gap [^5ed9c360] [^d2b43e42]. I should double-check that no major society has moved to a mandatory lower target; none have, reinforcing that 180/105 remains the practical, safety-focused standard pending definitive trials [^10763db4].

> Let me consider the perioperative context separately, because I need to ensure I'm not conflating treatment targets with risk thresholds. The 180/110 mmHg figure in perioperative guidance functions as a practical cutoff below which surgery is generally not delayed for BP alone, provided there is no acute target organ damage; above this, teams should assess for hypertensive urgency or emergency and optimize modifiable risks, but this is not a directive to treat to 180/110 as a goal, and rapid pre-op BP lowering can be harmful if it induces hypotension or organ hypoperfusion [^919004eb] [^34cd81fe]. Hold on, I should verify that this aligns with anesthetic risk data; yes, multiple perioperative sources converge on 180/110 as a reasonable pragmatic boundary, while emphasizing individualized risk assessment and postoperative BP optimization rather than aggressive pre-op normalization [^919004eb] [^34cd81fe].

> I should confirm when 180/105 is not the right target, because I need to avoid overgeneralization. Outside the 24-hour post-reperfusion window in acute ischemic stroke, chronic BP management should follow guideline targets such as less than 130/80 mmHg for most adults with hypertension, including those with diabetes or high risk, recognizing that older or frail adults may require individualized, more conservative goals and that the balance of benefits and harms shifts with age, comorbidity, and tolerance [^4d44852c] [^cf989ea4] [^7aa404b6]. Wait, let me verify the diabetes-specific data; UKPDS and subsequent analyses support tighter control for microvascular and stroke risk reduction, reinforcing that 180/105 is far too high for chronic management and belongs only to the acute reperfusion context [^a1b479ec] [^5fec2a72]. I should also note that in patients with acute ischemic stroke who do not receive reperfusion therapy, routine early BP lowering is not recommended unless BP exceeds about 220/120 mmHg, again underscoring that 180/105 is a reperfusion-specific safety threshold rather than a universal acute stroke target [^11953089] [^98957198].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the synthesis is precise. We "need" the 180/105 mmHg threshold because it operationalizes a safety sweet spot after reperfusion therapies for acute ischemic stroke: high enough to avoid iatrogenic hypotension in compromised cerebrovascular beds, yet low enough to mitigate reperfusion hemorrhage and edema, with the balance of evidence and guidelines supporting this target for at least 24 hours post-thrombolysis or post-thrombectomy, while acknowledging that lower post-reperfusion targets remain investigational and should be individualized [^0795e665] [^10763db4] [^d26e5687]. In perioperative care, 180/110 mmHg serves as a pragmatic risk boundary rather than a treatment goal, guiding whether to proceed or delay, whereas chronic hypertension care should target substantially lower values with shared decision-making and tolerance-based adjustments [^919004eb] [^34cd81fe] [^4d44852c].

The 180/105 mmHg threshold is used to **balance hemorrhagic and ischemic risks** in acute ischemic stroke patients receiving reperfusion therapy [^e6df7072]. It is the **maximum safe BP** for 24 hours after IV thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy to reduce symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage [^0795e665] while preserving cerebral perfusion [^0daf04ca]. Lower targets (e.g. < 140/90) may be considered after successful reperfusion, but evidence is limited and 180/105 remains the guideline-backed standard [^d2b43e42] [^10763db4].

---

## Clinical context and rationale

The 180/105 mmHg threshold is applied in the **acute phase of ischemic stroke**, particularly in patients receiving reperfusion therapies such as IV thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy [^0795e665]. The primary rationale is to **minimize the risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH)** [^e6df7072], a major complication of reperfusion therapies, while maintaining adequate cerebral perfusion to prevent ischemic injury [^0daf04ca].

---

## Evidence supporting the 180/105 mmHg threshold

The 180/105 mmHg threshold is derived from **randomized controlled trials (RCTs)** and observational studies demonstrating a clear association between elevated blood pressure and increased risk of sICH following reperfusion therapies [^5ed9c360]. Specifically:

- **RCTs of IV thrombolysis**: Trials such as the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) study required blood pressure to be < 185/110 mmHg before treatment and < 180/105 mmHg for the first 24 hours post-treatment. This approach significantly reduced the risk of sICH without compromising neurological outcomes [^5ed9c360].

- **Mechanical thrombectomy trials**: Contemporary trials and guidelines have adopted the same 180/105 mmHg threshold for the first 24 hours post-procedure, given the similar risk of hemorrhagic complications associated with reperfusion [^0795e665] [^d2b43e42].

- **Observational studies**: Multiple observational studies have corroborated that blood pressure levels above 180/105 mmHg are independently associated with increased risk of sICH and worse functional outcomes [^5ed9c360] [^8895c7bd].

---

## Balance between hemorrhagic and ischemic risks

The 180/105 mmHg threshold represents a **careful balance** between two competing risks:

| **Risk** | **Rationale for 180/105 mmhg threshold** |
|-|-|
| Hemorrhagic risk | Elevated blood pressure increases the risk of sICH, which can be catastrophic and negate the benefits of reperfusion therapy [^5ed9c360] [^a8f5909d]. |
| Ischemic risk | Excessive blood pressure lowering can compromise cerebral perfusion, particularly in the penumbra, leading to infarct expansion and worse neurological outcomes [^0daf04ca] [^61d8fdad]. |

---

The 180/105 mmHg threshold is therefore a pragmatic compromise that **minimizes hemorrhagic risk** without excessively compromising cerebral perfusion [^0daf04ca].

---

## Current guideline recommendations

Major stroke guidelines consistently endorse the 180/105 mmHg threshold:

- **American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) 2019 guidelines**: Recommend maintaining blood pressure ≤ 180/105 mmHg during and for 24 hours after mechanical thrombectomy, and < 180/105 mmHg for 24 hours after IV thrombolysis [^0795e665] [^17b1faf4].

- **European Stroke Organisation (ESO) 2021 guidelines**: Similarly recommend maintaining blood pressure ≤ 180/105 mmHg during and for 24 hours after reperfusion therapies [^11953089].

- **Society of Neurointerventional Surgery (SNIS) 2022 guidelines**: Emphasize the importance of strict blood pressure control ≤ 180/105 mmHg during and after mechanical thrombectomy [^08b5f0b2].

---

## Exceptions and individualized considerations

While the 180/105 mmHg threshold is widely accepted, certain scenarios may warrant **individualized adjustments**:

- **Successful reperfusion**: Some experts advocate for lower targets (e.g. < 140/90 mmHg) in patients with successful reperfusion, although evidence is limited and this remains a topic of ongoing research [^d2b43e42] [^8895c7bd].

- **Patient-specific factors**: Age, comorbidities, and baseline blood pressure may influence the aggressiveness of blood pressure management, necessitating individualized decision-making [^61d8fdad].

---

## Conclusion

The 180/105 mmHg threshold is a **critical component of acute ischemic stroke management**, particularly in patients undergoing reperfusion therapies. It is supported by robust evidence demonstrating reduced risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage without compromising neurological outcomes. This threshold represents a careful balance between hemorrhagic and ischemic risks and is consistently endorsed by major stroke guidelines. While individualized considerations may apply, the 180/105 mmHg threshold remains the standard of care in clinical practice.

Why it is important to do this review

Current recommendations in the guidelines for ischemic stroke management suggest maintaining blood pressure below 180/105 mmHg for 24 hours after endovascular thrombectomy. Similar blood pressure values are recommended in cases of systemic thrombolysis. However, the evidence supporting these recommendations stems from non‐randomized studies with low‐certainty evidence. Some studies have suggested that achieving lower values of systolic blood pressure (reducing to less than 160 mmHg) after the procedure would be beneficial in achieving the best functional outcome and reducing the risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage.

Considering the global incidence of ischemic strokes, the investments made in procedures for achieving cerebral reperfusion, the recognized efficacy of reperfusion as a treatment for ischemic stroke, and the crucial significance of blood pressure management during the acute phase, along with the existing uncertainties in current recommendations and recent clinical trials aiming to provide clarity, it becomes essential to establish the appropriate blood pressure management for this population. This is crucial to minimize the risk of hemorrhage and complications, confine the ischemic area, and thereby optimize the functional outcome, resulting in an improved quality of life for individuals and a reduced burden on individuals, families, healthcare systems, and society as a whole.

In the second study, a post hoc observational analysis on the diabetic patients of the UKPDS investigators randomly assigned patients with diabetes to either 'tight BP control' (< 150/85 mmHg) or 'less-tight BP control' (< 180/105 mmHg). Patients in the < 150/85 mmHg group had a mean baseline BP of 159/94 mmHg and achieved a mean BP of 144/82 mmHg, whereas those in the < 180/105 mmHg group had a mean baseline BP of 160/94 mmHg and achieved a mean BP of 154/87 mmHg after more than 8 years of follow- up. Compared with the less-tight-control group, those in the tight-control group had a significant 44% reduction in risk of stroke (P = 0.013), a 32% reduction in risk of diabetes- related death (P = 0.019), and a 24% reduction in risk of diabetes-related end points (P = 0.0046). When the UKPDS investigators performed an additional 10-year follow-up of the patients, which included in-person visits and questionnaires but no attempt to intervene on BP, the benefits observed in the tight-control group at the first 8-year follow-up were no longer present. Over the entire 20-year follow-up period, no difference in the rate of any diabetes-related end points, MI, microvascular disease, or all-cause mortality was observed between the tight-control and less-tight-control groups.

Hypertension epidemiology and risk — Hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 130 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 80 mm Hg, among U.S. adults is 46%, and hypertension accounts for more atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) deaths than any other modifiable ASCVD risk factor. A meta-analysis of 61 prospective studies observed a log-linear association between SBP levels < 115 to > 180 mm Hg and DBP levels < 75 to 105 mm Hg and ASCVD risk, and in that analysis, 20-mm Hg higher SBP and 10-mm Hg higher DBP were each associated with a doubling in the risk of death from stroke, heart disease, or other vascular disease. The increased ASCVD risk with higher SBP and DBP spans ages from 30 to > 80 years, with the high BP–related increase in absolute risk larger in older persons (≥ 65 years).

### Individualized blood pressure management during endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke under procedural sedation (INDIVIDUATE)-an explorative randomized controlled trial [^61d8fdad]. European Stroke Journal (2021). Medium credibility.

Current guidelines suggest, that in patients who are eligible for IV thrombolytic and endovascular therapy, BP should be lowered to < 185/110 mmHg before treatment and to < 180/105 mmHg after treatment with low to moderate evidence. However, in patients with a BP of < 220/110 mmHg who did not receive reperfusion therapy (i.e. IV fibrinolytic therapy and/or endovascular thrombectomy) initiating or reinitiating antihypertensive medication is not effective to prevent death or dependency with level A evidence.

In summary, there is evidence for association of worse functional outcome for extremes of blood pressure levels at presentation. For intraprocedural intra-individual blood pressure variation the evidence is largely limited for blood pressure drops, while some evidence, also showed negative effects of prolonged high blood pressures. As there are considerable inter-individual differences of necessary systemic blood pressure levels to maintain a sufficient penumbral perfusion, managing blood pressure via absolute targets independent of the individual needs might be a suboptimal approach. Lower BP than necessary might lead to reduced penumbral hypoperfusion and thus larger infarction, higher values might be associated with adverse effects like edema and hemorrhage. The admission blood pressure might represent the lowest necessary compensatory blood pressure to maintain penumbral perfusion. Thus, it could be reasonable to maintain intraprocedural systolic blood pressure before reperfusion at the presentation level, if higher and lower bounds for extreme values are established.

The HOT trial included a prespecified subgroup analysis in 1,501 diabetic subjects (age: 61.5 years; baseline BP: 170/105 mmHg), randomized to three different DBP targets: 90, 85, and 80 mmHg. Achieved BP was 144/85, 141/83, and 140/81 mmHg in the three target groups, respectively. A target of 80 mmHg significantly reduced both major cardiovascular event rates (11.9/1,000 person-years; RR 0.49; 95% CI, 0.29–0.81) and cardiovascular mortality (3.7/1,000 person-years; RR 0.33; 95% CI, 0.14–0.78) compared with a target of 90 mmHg (24.4/1,000 person-years and 11.1/1,000 person-years, respectively).

Small differences in BP between tight and less tight BP control

Although the difference between BP targets considered at entry for tight (≤ 150/85 mmHg) and less tight (≤ 180/105 mmHg) BP control groups was wide (30/20 mmHg), the difference between mean BP levels achieved over the 4 years of the randomized intervention for the tight and less tight BP control was relatively small (143/82 vs. 154/88 mmHg, respectively, P < 0.0001), and this might have contributed to the lack of differences in outcome at the end of the extended follow-up.

SHORT- AND LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF TIGHT AND CONVENTIONAL BP CONTROL IN THE UKPDS-HDS

Ten years after the outset of the UKPDS, 1,148 of the main study participants (BP ≥ 160/90 mmHg or ≥ 150/85 mmHg in case of ongoing antihypertensive therapy) were enrolled into the HDS and randomly assigned to either tight BP control (aiming for a BP ≤ 150/85 mmHg with either captopril up to 50 mg twice daily, or atenolol up to 100 mg once daily) or less tight BP control group (aiming for a BP ≤ 180/105 mmHg, avoiding the use of ACE inhibitors or β-blockers). Additional therapies could be sequentially added if needed. Randomized intervention continued over 4 years, and when the interventional study closed in 1997, the median duration of follow-up since the beginning of the main UKPDS was 8.4 years. In the tight BP control group, systolic and diastolic BP decreased by 10 and 5 mmHg, respectively, and were significantly lower than in the less tight BP control group (143/82 vs. 154/88 mmHg, respectively, P < 0.001). At the end of the intervention period, there was a significant reduction of 37% (P = 0.009) in the RR of microvascular outcomes and a 44% reduction in the risk of stroke (P = 0.01), with no significant risk reduction in any other macrovascular end points, including myocardial infarction. After the period of randomized intervention, the survivor cohort of the HDS (n = 884) entered a posttrial follow-up to determine whether the risk reductions for microvascular and macrovascular outcomes achieved with tight BP control would be sustained after discontinuing the initial intensive antihypertensive treatment.

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients in the emergency department with asymptomatic elevated blood pressure [^6bfa708a]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2013). Medium credibility.

Definition — Asymptomatic markedly elevated blood pressure: JNC 7 classified stage 2 hypertension as systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 160 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 100 mm Hg, although many clinical studies use thresholds of systolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 180 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure greater than or equal to 110 mm Hg. This policy considers markedly elevated blood pressure to be consistent with the JNC 7 definition of stage 2 hypertension, and the term asymptomatic markedly elevated blood pressure is used where asymptomatic hypertension had previously been used in the published literature.

Acute ischemic stroke — blood pressure management recommendations include the following. Recommendation (1 C-LD) states that in patients with acute ischemic stroke, hypotension and hypovolemia should be corrected to maintain systemic perfusion levels necessary to support organ function. Recommendation (1 B-NR) specifies that patients eligible for IV thrombolytics should have BP lowered to SBP < 185 mm Hg and DBP < 110 mm Hg before therapy, and BP should be maintained below 180/105 mm Hg for at least the first 24 hours after initiating thrombolytic therapy to avoid complications. Recommendation (2b C-LD) adds that in patients with BP of ≥ 220/120 mm Hg who did not receive IV thrombolytic or endovascular treatment and have no comorbid conditions requiring acute antihypertensive treatment, it might be reasonable to lower BP by 15% during the first 24 hours after onset of stroke to improve outcomes.

### Advancing risk-based approaches in blood pressure management: reflections on the 2025 AHA / ACC statement [^c870bffa]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

According to the 2017 Guideline, 68 million individuals had uncontrolled hypertension and were recommended for antihypertensive therapy; of these, 35 million were untreated, and 33 million were receiving treatment but had not attained target BP levels. We advocate for the application of risk stratification to guide priority interventions in both cohorts, informing optimal escalation strategies for those inadequately controlled, and prioritizing interventions to address nontreatment in the untreated population. Drawing a parallel with lipid-lowering therapy, it is both rational and evidence-based to ensure that individuals at the highest risk receive the most effective — and, where appropriate, more intensive — therapeutic regimens. We propose that BP-lowering interventions should be classified by intensity, analogous to lipid-lowering therapies: low, moderate, and high intensity, corresponding to reductions in systolic BP of < 10, 10 to 19, and ≥ 20 mm Hg, respectively. Those at the highest absolute risk should generally be prioritized for high-intensity regimens, provided adverse effects do not preclude their use. Achieving a mean SBP of ≤ 120 mm Hg is essential to maintain the majority of BP readings below 130/80 mm Hg over time, given the natural intraindividual variability in BP. Thus, all patients with untreated mean SBP > 140 mm Hg will require high-intensity regimens to attain and sustain optimal BP control and minimize cardiovascular risk. The substantial expansion of high-intensity therapy should therefore be directed primarily towards individuals at the highest absolute risk and with the greatest gap to achieving optimal BP. Given the heightened urgency in patients with high predicted risk, immediate pharmacological intervention — potentially with dual therapy — should be considered as the default strategy. Naturally, this approach must be tailored to patient preferences and tolerability; nonetheless, the evidence increasingly supports early, decisive intervention in those most likely to benefit.

### 2018 guidelines for the early management of patients with acute ischemic stroke: a guideline for healthcare professionals from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^e6a0ec2e]. Stroke (2018). Medium credibility.

Blood pressure management in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) includes that hypotension and hypovolemia should be corrected to maintain systemic perfusion levels necessary to support organ function. Patients who have elevated BP and are otherwise eligible for treatment with IV alteplase should have their BP carefully lowered so that their systolic BP is < 185 mm Hg and their diastolic BP is < 110 mm Hg before IV fibrinolytic therapy is initiated; the RCTs of IV alteplase required the BP to be < 185 mm Hg systolic and < 110 mm Hg diastolic before treatment and < 180/105 mm Hg for the first 24 hours after treatment. The usefulness of drug-induced hypertension in patients with AIS is not well established.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Acute ischemic stroke — acute blood pressure targets: In patients with acute ischemic stroke, hypotension and hypovolemia should be corrected to maintain systemic perfusion levels necessary to support organ function (COR 1; LOE C-LD). For patients eligible for or receiving IV thrombolytics, BP should be lowered to SBP ≤ 185 mm Hg and DBP < 110 mm Hg before IV thrombolytic therapy is initiated and then maintained below 180/105 mm Hg for at least the first 24 hours after initiating therapy (COR 1; LOE B-NR). In patients who undergo endovascular treatment, it is reasonable to maintain the BP at ≤ 180/105 mm Hg during and for 24 hours after the procedure to improve long-term functional outcomes and prevent death (COR 2a; LOE B-NR). In patients with BP of ≥ 220/120 mm Hg who did not receive IV thrombolytic or endovascular treatment and who have no comorbid conditions requiring acute antihypertensive treatment, it might be reasonable to lower BP by 15% during the first 24 hours after onset of stroke to improve outcomes (COR 2b; LOE C-LD).

Recent guidelines on diagnosis and management of high blood pressure (BP) include substantial changes and several new concepts compared with previous guidelines. These are reviewed and their clinical implications are discussed in this article. The goal is to provide a practical reference to assist clinicians with up-to-date management of patients with high BP. Important issues include new diagnostic thresholds, out-of-office BP monitoring, intensified treatment goals, and a different approach to resistant hypertension. Finally, differences among guidelines, the persistent controversies that have led to them, and their implications for clinical practice are discussed.

Acute ischemic stroke — blood pressure management around mechanical thrombectomy: In patients who undergo mechanical thrombectomy, it is reasonable to maintain the BP ≤ 180/105 mm Hg during and for 24 hours after the procedure, and in patients who undergo mechanical thrombectomy with successful reperfusion, it might be reasonable to maintain BP at a level < 180/105 mm Hg. Supporting context on protocols includes that the vast majority of patients in under 6-hour randomized clinical trials were managed with BP ≤ 180/105 during and for 24 hours after the procedure; the ESCAPE protocol states that systolic BP ≥ 150 mm Hg is probably useful while the artery remains occluded and that controlling BP after reperfusion and aiming for a normal BP is sensible, and the DAWN protocol recommends maintaining systolic BP < 140 mm Hg in the first 24 hours after reperfusion; labetalol or an IV β-blocker such as metoprolol in low doses is recommended.

### Identifying individuals at risk for cardiovascular events across the spectrum of blood pressure levels [^7067aefc]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Conclusions

In summary, a hypertension treatment strategy focused solely on blood pressure thresholds leaves substantial ASCVD risk unaddressed. Multivariable risk estimation may help identify the types of persons who are likely to benefit from risk-reducing therapies across the spectrum of SBP. Clinical trials that stratify participants by pretreatment absolute risk and blood pressure and then randomize the groups with discordant treatment recommendations to antihypertensive medications and other risk-reducing therapies versus placebo are needed to confirm the merits of absolute risk assessment in guiding primary prevention therapies.

### US hypertension management guidelines: a review of the recent past and recommendations for the future [^8eb2328e]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Hypertension affects ≈29% of the US adult population, an estimated 72 million people, with a prevalence of > 65% in persons older than 60 years. 1, 2 It is an important risk factor for myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), stroke, and cardiovascular disease (CVD), accounting for ≈41% of all CVD deaths. 3, 4 Indeed, there is a known graded relationship between increasing blood pressure (BP) and the risk of CVD, starting at 115/75 mm Hg. 5 Based on observational data, an increase in BP of 20 mm Hg systolic or 10 mm Hg diastolic is associated with a doubling of the risk of CVD death, regardless of age. 5 Further, hypertension in middle age is known to increase the risk of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dementia in later life, an important issue given the aging demographic in Western societies. 6 Finally, despite the fact that BP recognition and control are improving, it is concerning that nearly half of the hypertensive population remains suboptimally controlled. 2

With the 2003 Joint National Committee's seventh report (JNC 7) becoming increasingly outdated and the 2011 Institute of Medicine report calling for high‐quality evidence‐based guidelines, 7, 8 the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) was initially appointed to create an updated treatment guideline for hypertension under the auspices of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Although the NIH ultimately withdrew from the guideline development process at a late stage in the development of JNC 8, the panel decided, nonetheless, to publish their recommendations independently.

The panel aimed to answer 3 questions: Does initiating antihypertensive treatment at specific BP thresholds improve health outcomes? Does treatment with antihypertensive therapy to a specific BP goal improve health outcomes? Are there differences in benefit/harm between antihypertensive drugs or drug classes on specific health outcomes? The committee focused exclusively on large, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) as supporting evidence, although 5 of the 9 recommendations in the final report were ultimately based on expert opinion. Partly in response to JNC 8, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA) are now in the process of developing official hypertension guidelines. In this review, we discuss the basis of each recommendation from the JNC 8 panel, provide additional insights, and compare these recommendations with guidelines from other professional societies to generate suggestions for the new AHA/ACC hypertension guideline committee.

### Effects of blood pressure lowering on outcome incidence in hypertension: 2. effects at different baseline and achieved blood pressure levels – overview and meta-analyses of randomized trials [^5841b9a5]. Journal of Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Relevant clinical questions not approached by randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of blood pressure (BP)-lowering treatment can be explored by meta-analyses stratified by clinical criteria.

Objectives

Investigating whether all grades of hypertension benefit from BP-lowering treatment and which are the target BP levels to maximize outcome reduction.

Methods

Of the 68 RCTs of intentional and nonintentional BP-lowering, those without baseline antihypertensive drugs were stratified by the average baseline SBP and DBP (hypertension grades 1, 2, and 3). RCTs with or without baseline treatment were considered for investigating the effects of mean achieved SBP/DBP across three SBP cutoffs and two DBP cutoffs. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) (random-effects model), standardized to 10/5mmHg SBP/DBP reduction, and absolute risk reductions of seven fatal and nonfatal outcomes were calculated. Differences between relative and absolute risk reductions in the different strata of baseline or achieved SBP/DBP were evaluated by trend or heterogeneity analyses.

Results

In 32 RCTs (104,359 individuals), significant outcome reductions were found independently of the hypertension grade, with no trend toward risk ratio changes with increasing baseline BP. A secondary analysis limited to RCTs on grade 1 hypertension at low-to-moderate risk showed significant outcome reductions [risk ratio: stroke 0.33 (0.11–0.98), coronary events 0.68 (0.48–0.95), and death 0.53 (0.35–0.80)]. In 32 RCTs (128,232 individuals), relative and absolute outcome reductions were significant for the SBP differences across 150 and 140mmHg cutoffs. Below 130mmHg, only stroke and all-cause death were significantly reduced. Absolute outcome reduction showed a significant trend to decrease, the lower the SBP cutoff considered. In 29 RCTs (107,665 individuals), outcomes were significantly reduced across DBP cutoffs of 90 and 80mmHg. After excluding RCTs with baseline DBP less than 90mmHg, only stroke reduction was significant at achieved DBP less than 80mmHg.

Conclusion

Meta-analyses favor BP-lowering treatment even in grade 1 hypertension at low-to-moderate risk, and lowering SBP/DBP to less than 140/90mmHg. Achieving less than 130/80mmHg appears safe, but only adds further reduction in stroke.

### Is 2015 the primetime year for prehypertension? Prehypertension: a cardiovascular risk factor or simply a risk marker? [^97cf6e38]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2015). Low credibility.

Is it Time for Change?

A 50‐year‐old man with a BP of 135/80 mm Hg is twice as likely to die from a stroke as his counterpart with a BP of 115/80 mmHg. However, both subjects are considered non‐hypertensive since the arbitrary cutoff for hypertension of 140/90 mm Hg is not reached. So, how can we better differentiate between these 2 subjects with different CV prognoses?

Over 12 years ago, the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Diagnosis, Evaluation and Treatment of High BP (JNC 7)defined a new BP category, prehypertension, a BP between 120/80 and 139/89 mm Hg that specifically identifies a higher‐risk subject with BP higher than optimal BP but yet lower than the arbitrary cutoff for hypertension.

Intravenous alteplase for acute ischemic stroke — BP thresholds and targets: Randomized controlled trials required SBP to be < 185 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < 110 mm Hg before treatment and SBP < 180 mm Hg and DBP < 105 mm Hg for the first 24 hours after treatment; observational studies and meta-analyses suggest that the risk of hemorrhage after administration of alteplase is greater in patients with higher BPs and in patients with more BP variability, and it is thus reasonable to target the BPs used in the RCTs of IV alteplase. ENCHANTED showed that antihypertensive treatment to target SBP 130 to 140 mm Hg within 6 hours of stroke onset in patients treated with IV thrombolytic did not show improvement in outcome.

Acute ischemic stroke — blood pressure management recommendations are: In patients with acute ischemic stroke, hypotension and hypovolemia should be corrected to maintain systemic perfusion levels necessary to support organ function (COR 1, LOE C-LD). Patients eligible for IV thrombolytics should have BP lowered to SBP ≤ 185 mm Hg and DBP < 110 mm Hg before therapy and then maintained below 180/105 mm Hg for at least the first 24 hours after initiating thrombolytic therapy (COR 1, LOE B-NR). In patients undergoing endovascular treatment, it is reasonable to maintain BP at ≤ 180/105 mm Hg during and for 24 hours after the procedure to improve long-term functional outcomes and prevent death (COR 2a, LOE B-NR). In patients with BP of > 220/120 mm Hg who did not receive IV thrombolytic or endovascular treatment and have no comorbid conditions requiring acute antihypertensive treatment, it might be reasonable to lower BP by 15% during the first 24 hours after onset of stroke to improve outcomes (COR 2b, LOE C-LD).

### Blood pressure control in patients initiating antihypertensive therapy [^71192326]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2008). Low credibility.

Background

Although information concerning the attainment of goal blood pressure for patients commencing antihypertensive therapy is available from controlled trials, no studies have examined this issue in the context of typical clinical practice.

Objective

To examine attainment of blood pressure control over time in patients initiating antihypertensive therapy in clinical practice.

Methods

Using an electronic medical records database, we identified all adults with systolic blood pressure (SBP)/diastolic blood pressure (DBP) of 140/90 mm Hg or higher who initiated antihypertensive drug therapy. Subjects were stratified into subgroups based on the presence of high-risk conditions or characteristics described by the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure in their seventh report as "compelling indications" (eg, diabetes) or "special situations" (eg, obesity). Blood pressure control was examined in terms of goal attainment and reductions in blood pressure using last available readings at days 90, 180, and 360, following therapy initiation.

Results

Among the 10,345 study subjects, 47% had compelling indications and 39% had special situations. In the former group, 62% (95% CI 61 to 64) of patients with Stage 1 hypertension (140–159/90–99 mm Hg) attained blood pressure less than 140/90 mm Hg by day 360; among those with Stage 2 hypertension (≥ 160/100 mm Hg), the corresponding figure was 48% (95% CI 46 to 50). In the latter group, 64% (95% CI 61 to 66) and 55% (95% CI 53 to 57) of patients with Stage 1 and Stage 2 hypertension, respectively, attained blood pressure less than 140/90 mm Hg by day 360. Among those without high-risk conditions, these percentages were 63% (95% CI 59 to 67) and 55% (95% CI 52 to 59). Among patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease, 25% (95% CI 24 to 26) attained blood pressure less than 130/80 mm Hg by day 360.

Conclusions

Many patients starting antihypertensive therapy in clinical practice fail to achieve blood pressure control within the first year. Control is no better, and perhaps worse, among patients at highest risk of adverse outcomes.

### Treatment blood pressure targets for hypertension [^bf16a63f]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2009). Low credibility.

Background

When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors need to know what blood pressure (BP) target they should try to achieve. The standard of clinical practice for some time has been ≤ 140–160/ 90–100 mmHg. New guidelines are recommending BP targets lower than this standard. It is not known whether attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard reduces mortality and morbidity.

Objectives

To determine if lower BP targets (≤ 135/85 mmHg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard BP targets (≤ 140–160/ 90–100 mmHg).

Search Strategy

Electronic search of MEDLINE (1966–2008), EMBASE (1980–2008), and CENTRAL (up to June 2008); references from review articles, clinical guidelines, and clinical trials.

Selection Criteria

Randomized controlled trials comparing patients randomized to lower or to standard BP targets and providing data on any of the primary outcomes below.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two reviewers (JAA, MIP) independently assessed the included trials and data entry. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; total cardiovascular events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure and end stage renal disease. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean systolic and diastolic BP and withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Main Results

No trials comparing different systolic BP targets were found. Seven trials (22,089 subjects) comparing different diastolic BP targets were included. Despite a -4/-3 mmHg greater achieved reduction in systolic/diastolic BP, p < 0.001, attempting to achieve "lower targets" instead of "standard targets" did not change total mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.86–1.15), myocardial infarction (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.74–1.09), stroke (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79–1.25), congestive heart failure (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.59–1.32), major cardiovascular events (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.83–1.07), or end-stage renal disease (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.81–1.27). The net health effect of lower targets cannot be fully assessed due to lack of information regarding all total serious adverse events and withdrawals due to adverse effects in 6 of 7 trials. A sensitivity analysis in diabetic patients and in patients with chronic renal disease also did not show a reduction in any of the mortality and morbidity outcomes with lower targets as compared to standard targets.

Authors' Conclusions

Treating patients to lower than standard BP targets, ≤ 140–160/90–100 mmHg, does not reduce mortality or morbidity. Because guidelines are recommending even lower targets for diabetes mellitus and chronic renal disease, we are currently conducting systematic reviews in those groups of patients.

Blood pressure management after mechanical thrombectomy — In patients who undergo mechanical thrombectomy, it is reasonable to maintain the BP at ≤ 180/105 mm Hg during and for 24 hours after the procedure, and in those with successful reperfusion, it might be reasonable to maintain BP at a level < 180/105 mm Hg. Trial protocols cited note that in < 6-hour RCTs, management followed BP ≤ 180/105 during and for 24 hours after the procedure; the ESCAPE protocol states that SBP ≥ 150 mm Hg is probably useful while the artery remains occluded and advises controlling BP once reperfusion has been achieved, with labetalol or an IV β-blocker such as metoprolol in low doses recommended; the DAWN protocol recommends maintaining SBP < 140 mm Hg in the first 24 hours in subjects who are reperfused after mechanical thrombectomy (defined as achieving more than two-thirds MCA territory reperfusion).

### Blood pressure management after mechanical thrombectomy in stroke patients [^8895c7bd]. Journal of the Neurological Sciences (2020). Medium credibility.

Endovascular treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and mechanical thrombectomy (MT) is proven as a safe and effective novel treatment for emergent large vessel occlusion in the anterior cerebral circulation. However, there are still many unanswered questions on peri and post-procedural management including blood pressure (BP) control. The current guidelines recommend maintaining BP < 180/105 mmHg in the first 24 h after MT. However, recent studies suggest that maintaining BP levels at lower levels in the first 24 h after successful revascularization have been associated with favorable functional outcome, reduced mortality rate, and hemorrhagic complications. Not only absolute BP but also its variation in the first 24 h after MT have been associated with neurological outcomes. Evidence on the effect of BP variability (BPV) after MT in AIS even though limited, it does indicate the association of the higher BPV in the first 24 h after MT and poor functional outcomes in AIS. In this review, we will discuss the current literature on BP management in the first 24 h after MT and the impact of BPV in the first 24 h after MT.

Intravenous alteplase in acute ischemic stroke — blood pressure targets and evidence: The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of IV alteplase required the SBP to be < 185 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) < 110 mm Hg before treatment and SBP < 180 mm Hg and DBP < 105 mm Hg for the first 24 hours after treatment. Observational studies and meta-analyses suggest that the risk of hemorrhage after administration of alteplase is greater in patients with higher BPs and in patients with more BP variability, and the exact BP at which the risk of hemorrhage after IV alteplase increases is unknown; it is thus reasonable to target the BPs used in the RCTs of IV alteplase. ENCHANTED showed that antihypertensive treatment to target SBP 130 to 140 mm Hg within 6 hours of stroke onset in patients treated with IV thrombolytic did not show improvement in outcome.

### Blood pressure targets for hypertension in older adults [^63f63e9b]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Eight out of 10 major antihypertensive trials in older adults attempted to achieve a target systolic blood pressure (BP) less than 160 mmHg. Collectively these trials demonstrated benefit for treatment, as compared to no treatment, for an older adult with BP greater than 160 mmHg. However an even lower BP target of less than 140 mmHg is commonly applied to all age groups. At the present time it is not known whether a lower or higher BP target is associated with better cardiovascular outcomes in older adults.

Objectives

To assess the effects of a higher (less than 150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg) BP target compared to the lower BP target of less than 140/90 mmHg in hypertensive adults 65 years of age or older.

Search Methods

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to February 2017: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, MEDLINE, Embase, ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work.

Selection Criteria

Randomised trials, of at least one year's duration, conducted on hypertensive adults aged 65 years or older, which report the effect on mortality and morbidity of a higher systolic or diastolic BP treatment target (whether ambulatory, home, or office measurements) in the range of systolic BP less than 150 to 160 mmHg or diastolic BP less than 95 to 105 mmHg as compared to a lower BP treatment target of less than 140/90 mmHg or lower.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently screened and selected trials for inclusion, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We combined data for dichotomous outcomes using the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and for continuous outcomes we used mean difference (MD). Primary outcomes were all-cause mortality, stroke, institutionalisation, and cardiovascular serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes included cardiovascular mortality, non-cardiovascular mortality, unplanned hospitalisation, each component of cardiovascular serious adverse events separately (including cerebrovascular disease, cardiac disease, vascular disease, and renal failure), total serious adverse events, total minor adverse events, withdrawals due to adverse effects, systolic BP achieved, and diastolic BP achieved.

Main Results

We found and included three unblinded randomised trials in 8221 older adults (mean age 74.8 years), in which higher BP targets of less than 150/90 mmHg (two trials) and less than 160/90 mmHg (one trial) were compared to a lower target of less than 140/90 mmHg. Treatment to the two different BP targets over two to four years failed to produce a difference in any of our primary outcomes, including all-cause mortality (RR 1.24 95% CI 0.99 to 1.54), stroke (RR 1.25 95% CI 0.94 to 1.67) and total cardiovascular serious adverse events (RR 1.19 95% CI 0.98 to 1.45). However, the 95% confidence intervals of these outcomes suggest the lower BP target is probably not worse, and might offer a clinically important benefit. We judged all comparisons to be based on low-quality evidence. Data on adverse effects were not available from all trials and not different, including total serious adverse events, total minor adverse events, and withdrawals due to adverse effects.

Authors' Conclusions

At the present time there is insufficient evidence to know whether a higher BP target (less than150 to 160/95 to 105 mmHg) or a lower BP target (less than 140/90 mmHg) is better for older adults with high BP. Additional good-quality trials assessing BP targets in this population are needed.

Key Points

Question

What are the safe and optimal diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ranges among adults with treated systolic blood pressure (SBP) of less than 130 mm Hg?

Findings

In this cohort study of 7515 patients from 2 randomized clinical trials who had treated SBP of less than 130 mm Hg, a DBP of less than 60 mm Hg was associated with increased cardiovascular risk and a DBP between 70 and 80 mm Hg was associated with lower cardiovascular risk.

Meaning

The findings suggest that a DBP of less than 60 mm Hg may be harmful and a DBP between 70 and 80 mm Hg is an optimal target for patients with treated SBP of less than 130 mm Hg; this topic merits further study.

JNC 8 hypertension guideline — key clinical questions and recommendation scope states that the guideline focuses on the panel's 3 highest-ranked questions related to high BP management, and Nine recommendations are made reflecting these questions; the questions are whether, in adults with hypertension, initiating antihypertensive pharmacologic therapy at specific BP thresholds improves health outcomes, whether treatment with antihypertensive pharmacologic therapy to a specified BP goal leads to improvements in health outcomes, and whether various antihypertensive drugs or drug classes differ in comparative benefits and harms on specific health outcomes.

Perioperative hypertension — blood pressure (BP) targets and surgical timing: Expert opinion states BP control to levels recommended by this guideline (BP < 130/80 mm Hg) before major elective procedures is reasonable, and if oral agents cannot be used, intravenous medications are reasonable to control BP. Caution is advised when continuing therapy in patients with low perioperative BPs, older adults (age ≥ 65 years), and those at high risk for perioperative hypotension. Evidence is conflicting for delaying surgery when diastolic BP (DBP) is > 110 mm Hg; preoperative hypertension was associated with a 35% increase in cardiovascular complications, and increased cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal failure has been reported with DBP > 110 mm Hg, whereas DBP < 110 mm Hg does not appear to confer significantly increased risk. During anesthesia induction, a sympathetic reaction can produce a 20 to 30 mm Hg BP rise in patients with normal BP. An elevated day-of-surgery BP may reflect white-coat hypertension; referring to baseline ambulatory BP is recommended to guide management. Without evidence of increased perioperative risk when preoperative SBP/DBP is < 180/110 mm Hg, there is little evidence to defer surgery, and BP can be managed postoperatively or after discharge.

Intravenous (IV) alteplase — pre- and post-treatment blood pressure thresholds and outcomes. The RCTs of IV alteplase required the SBP to be < 185 mm Hg and DBP < 110 mm Hg before treatment and SBP < 180 mm Hg and DBP < 105 mm Hg for the first 24 hours after treatment. Observational studies and meta-analyses suggest that the risk of hemorrhage after administration of alteplase is greater in patients with higher BPs and in patients with more BP variability. The exact BP at which the risk of hemorrhage after IV alteplase increases is unknown. It is thus reasonable to target the BPs used in the RCTs of IV alteplase. ENCHANTED (Enhanced Control of Hypertension and Thrombolysis Stroke Study) showed that antihypertensive treatment to target SBP 130 to 140 mm Hg within 6 hours of stroke onset in patients treated with IV thrombolytic did not show improvement in outcome.

Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Perioperative blood pressure targets and surgical timing — noncardiac surgery: The expert opinion of this writing committee is that control of BP to levels recommended by this guideline (BP < 130/80 mm Hg) is reasonable before undertaking major elective procedures, and if the patient is unable to take oral medications it is reasonable to use IV medications as necessary; caution is advised when continuing antihypertensive therapy in patients with low perioperative BP, older adults (age ≥ 65 years), and those at high risk for perioperative hypotension. Evidence is conflicting for recommending delay of surgery when DBP > 110 mm Hg, but preoperative hypertension was associated with a 35% increase in cardiovascular complications, whereas patients with DBP < 110 mm Hg do not appear to be at significantly increased risk. During induction of anesthesia a sympathetic reaction can result in a 20 to 30 mm Hg increase in BP, and an elevated BP on the day of surgery may represent a situational (white-coat hypertension) response; therefore, referring to patients' baseline ambulatory BP is recommended to guide BP management. Without evidence for increased risk for perioperative complications in patients whose preoperative SBP/DBP is < 180/110 mm Hg, there is little evidence to defer surgery, and BP can be controlled postoperatively or after discharge.

### Admission blood pressure and clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischaemic stroke treated with intravenous alteplase and endovascular treatment versus endovascular treatment alone: a MR CLEAN-NO IV substudy [^826afead]. European Stroke Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Some studies have reported an inverse relation of higher admission BP with lower odds of achieving successful reperfusion with EVT, whereas we observed no such association. This dissimilarity may be explained by the different treatment modalities, imaging techniques, or grading of flow restoration applied in these studies. Reperfusion grade was missing for 59 patients (11%) in our analyses which could have affected these results and our finding that there was no reperfusion effect modification of SBP on mRS score, even though missing scores were imputed. Also, other factors may be at play, such as patient characteristics or chance.

Current guidelines advocate a BP threshold of ≤ 185/110 mmHg before EVT (with or without IVT) and a limit of ≤ 180/105 mmHg during and for the first day after treatment, in order to avoid reperfusion haemorrhages with elevated BPs. We did not find effect modification by reperfusion status on the risk of sICH imposed by admission SBP, analogous to reported previously for post-EVT BP. Interestingly, sensitivity analyses of patients with admission BP below 185/110 mmHg showed no clear association of SBP with functional outcome. This suggests that the association of worse outcome with higher BPs is mainly driven by BP extremes, as was confirmed by our post hoc analysis demonstrating that admission BPs above the 185/110 mmHg threshold were strongly associated with worse functional outcome. However, these patients had their BPs lowered medically or spontaneously to below 185/110 mmHg before treatment, and poorer outcome in this group could also be an adverse effect of BP lowering or from longer time to reperfusion therapy. Nonetheless, this BP threshold was established during a IVT pilot study, after three cases of sICH, and was afterwards adopted in acute ischaemic stroke guidelines. In the 3035 patients included in the Third International Stroke Trial (IST-3), the associations of BP (inclusion if BP < 220/130 mmHg) with functional outcome and with occurrence of sICH were independent of IVT (vs control). Also, the effectiveness and safety of EVT were found to be similar for the SBP range of 105–200 mmHg in the MR CLEAN trial (n = 500). Although the risk of worse outcomes with higher BPs has been established, the treatment effects of IVT or EVT are not modified BP by level, and thereby provide no clear evidence for a strict BP threshold.

### High initial blood pressure after acute stroke is associated with poor functional outcome [^319fda22]. Journal of Internal Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate the relationship between high initial blood pressure and functional outcome in patients with acute stroke.

Design

An observational study based on the data from the Intravenous Nimodipine West European Stroke Trial (INWEST). INWEST was a placebo-controlled randomized study terminated prematurely; subsequent analysis found a correlation between diastolic BP (DBP) reduction caused by high-dose nimodipine and unfavourable outcome. Subjects. Of the 295 patients with acute ischaemic stroke (within 24 h) recruited in the INWEST, 265 were included in this analysis [n = 92 for placebo, n = 93 for low-dose nimodipine (1-mg h(-1)) and n = 80 for high-dose nimodipine (2-mg h(-1))]. Definition. Initial BP was defined as BP at the time of randomization. Normal initial BP (NIBP) = systolic BP (SBP) 120–160 and DBP 60–90 mmHg (n = 126). Four alternatives were defined as high initial BP (HIBP): (1) > 160/90 (n = 126), (2) > 170/95 (n = 106), (3) > 180/100 (n = 63), (4) > 190/105 (n = 45). Main outcome measures. Combined death or dependency (DD) (Barthel index < 60) at 21 days.

Results

In multiple logistic regression analyses, the odds ratio [OR] for DD at day 21 was significantly higher in patients with any definition of HIBP than with NIBP. For all patients, OR and 95% confidence intervals [CI] for 160/90 versus NIBP = 3.1, 1.3–7.3, respectively; for 170/95 = 3.3, 1.4–8.1; for 180/100 = 7.0, 2.1–22.8; for 190/105 = 3.7, 1.1–12.4. For only placebo patients, OR and 95% CI for 160/90 = 4.8, 1.2–19.3; for 170/95 = 4.4, 1.1–17.8; for 180/100 = 12.7, 2.2–74.7; for 190/105 = 5.6, 1.1–30.0. The outcome was similar at 24 weeks but did not reach statistical significance for the placebo patients.

Conclusion

Patients with HIBP had a poor functional outcome after acute stroke.

### Blood pressure variability after acute ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage: refining its definition, intervention opportunities, and research directions [^7d053b5d]. Neurocritical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

For AIS, the 2019 AHA/ASA Guideline recommended maintaining BP < 180/105 mm Hg for ≥ 24 h after intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) but did not offer BPV recommendations. Specific SBP goals after IVT were not provided from the cited Enhanced Control of Hypertension and Thrombolysis Stroke Study (ENCHANTED) trial, in which 90-day outcomes were similar for patients with SBP targets < 180 mm Hg versus 130–140 mm Hg. Thus, practice guidelines recommend "smooth" and "sustained" BP control in acute ICH, guideline recommendations for both ICH and AIS remain nonspecific, and evidence supporting specific SBP targets is limited.

Because this BPV quandary remains unsolved, we convened the Blood Pressure Variability in Cerebrovascular Emergencies (B-PRECISE) Consortia, an invited group of seven experts (all authors of this article) in vascular neurology, neurocritical care, perioperative medicine, emergency medicine, and clinical pharmacy. We met in person before the International Stroke Conference in Phoenix, Arizona in February 2024. Follow-up meetings occurred virtually, after Consortia members reviewed and edited drafts of the proceedings. This consensus is based on the current (limited) literature and collective decades of multidisciplinary clinical experience. Discussion questions raised by the Consortia (Table 1) had the ultimate goals to: initiate evidence-based dialogue about BPV; stimulate future research strategies on post-stroke BPV; and, similar to "CODE ICH" standardizing ICH hyperacute treatment, recognize that post-stroke BPV management represents an unmet need ripe for standardization.

### VA / DoD clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the primary care setting [^b4e0a966]. VA/DoD (2020). High credibility.

Hypertension definitions and treatment thresholds — VA/DoD CPG background summarizes evolving criteria and the Work Group definition. JNC 7 defined hypertension (HTN) as a systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≥ 140 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥ 90 mm Hg, and prehypertension was classified as SBP 120–139 or DBP 80–89. The 2017 ACC/AHA defines HTN as an SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg, a DBP ≥ 80 mm Hg, or both; it removed prehypertension and added elevated blood pressure defined as an SBP of 120–129 with a DBP < 80 mm Hg. For this CPG, the Work Group defines HTN as an SBP ≥ 130 mm Hg, a DBP ≥ 90 mm Hg, or both, and also as SBP and/or DBP at or above 130/90 mm Hg, assuming proper measurement technique. The page notes that treatment benefit has not been proven for lowering slightly elevated blood pressures to a "normal" blood pressure of 115/75 mm Hg, and for those with a blood pressure above "normal" but not in the hypertensive range there is no evidence to date that there is a benefit from treatment.

### Clinical overview of hypertension and emerging treatment considerations [^bbf9517c]. American Journal of Hypertension (2001). Low credibility.

Managing hypertension is a complex undertaking, where even the definition of the disorder is subject to discussion. Recently, there has been controversy concerning the most appropriate measure to determine health risks associated with hypertension. In the past, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) was the prime measure for defining hypertension, but currently systolic blood pressure (SBP) and pulse pressure have gained favor. Evidence now suggests that all three measures should be considered as part of the hypertensive profile, with the patient's age determining the relative importance of each. Aggressive treatment of hypertension may reduce morbidity and mortality. Data from trials clearly indicate that, for all stages of hypertension, the goal should be a maximum SBP of < 150 mm Hg and a DBP of < 90 mm Hg, with DBP values as low as 70 mm Hg being safe. For individuals with diabetes mellitus, these target values should be even lower — SBP < 140 mm Hg and DBP < 80 mm Hg. As a significant number of deaths attributable to hypertension occur in patients who are not diagnosed as hypertensive but whose blood pressure (BP) is above the optimal level of 120/80 mm Hg, lowering BP levels in this group is recommended as well, with lifestyle modification being first-line therapy. Because controlling BP to < 140/90 mm Hg often requires the use of two or three agents, the tolerability of the entire regimen must be considered. However, with the multitude of antihypertensive drugs currently available, no patient's BP should remain above the 150/90 mm Hg level.

### Thresholds for diagnosing hypertension based on automated office blood pressure measurements and cardiovascular risk [^1b580be0]. Hypertension (2015). Low credibility.

The risk of cardiovascular events in relation to blood pressure is largely based on readings taken with a mercury sphygmomanometer in populations which differ from those of today in terms of hypertension severity and drug therapy. Given replacement of the mercury sphygmomanometer with electronic devices, we sought to determine the blood pressure threshold for a significant increase in cardiovascular risk using a fully automated device, which takes multiple readings with the subject resting quietly alone. Participants were 3627 community-dwelling residents aged > 65 years untreated for hypertension. Automated office blood pressure readings were obtained in a community pharmacy with subjects seated and undisturbed. This method for recording blood pressure produces similar readings in different settings, including a pharmacy and family doctor's office providing the above procedures are followed. Subjects were followed for a mean (SD) of 4.9 (1.0) years for fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events. Adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) were computed for 10 mm Hg increments in blood pressure (mm Hg) using Cox proportional hazards regression and the blood pressure category with the lowest event rate as the reference category. A total of 271 subjects experienced a cardiovascular event. There was a significant (P = 0.02) increase in the hazard ratio of 1.66 (1.09, 2.54) at a systolic blood pressure of 135 to 144 and 1.72 (1.21, 2.45; P = 0.003) at a diastolic blood pressure of 80 to 89. A significant (P = 0.03) increase in hazard ratio of 1.73 (1.04, 2.86) occurred with a pulse pressure of 80 to 89. These findings are consistent with a threshold of 135/85 for diagnosing hypertension in older subjects using automated office blood pressure.

### Advancing risk-based approaches in blood pressure management: reflections on the 2025 AHA / ACC statement [^b37fc7bc]. Hypertension (2025). Medium credibility.

Gauging the Impact of the Recommended Risk-Based Strategy

Echoing, to some extent, the 2024 European Society of Cardiology guidelines, the AHA Statement categorically exempts individuals with BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg (stage 2 hypertension) from formal risk assessment. The same exemption is extended to the BP range of 130 to 139/80 to 89 mm Hg (stage 1 hypertension) for those with established cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, or any individual with ongoing antihypertensive therapy. These groups are automatically designated as high risk.

With these exemptions, a formal risk assessment strategy applies to ≈23 million individuals, of whom around 2.5 million (equivalent to 1% of US adults) are projected to exceed the PREVENT risk threshold of > 7.5% for immediate pharmacological intervention (Figure 1). These rates are roughly consistent with the application of the European Society of Cardiology guidelines to European adults, where ≈1% to 4% would be recommended for treatment based on their predicted high cardiovascular risk and moderate BP elevation.

Acute ischemic stroke — blood pressure management thresholds: Unless the patient is eligible for acute reperfusion intervention, systolic blood pressure is usually treated only if it is > 220 mm Hg and diastolic pressure only if it is > 120 mm Hg; in patients who receive rtPA, systolic blood pressure > 180 mm Hg and diastolic pressure > 105 mm Hg should be treated with antihypertensive drugs such as labetolol or nicardipine. Hypotension during a stroke can also significantly worsen outcomes, and mortality risk may follow a U-shaped pattern with changes from a systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg, and physiological derangements contributing to hypotension should be corrected as soon as possible.

### Is 60 the new 80 in hypertension? [^99078bf1]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Since the release of the "2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8)", much controversy has ensued over the appropriate systolic blood pressure goal for those over the age of 60 years. This guideline suggested liberalizing the target for this population to < 150 mmHg, moving away from previous guidelines suggesting a target of < 140 mmHg. While some national quality measures have accepted the new relaxed blood pressure goal, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology have not. Recently published data show that millions of adults over 60 years of age would be classified as controlled using a threshold of < 150 mmHg, but not with a target of < 140 mmHg. In addition, emerging randomized trial evidence suggests that targeting a systolic blood pressure well below 140 mmHg is beneficial in older adults. In light of the improved health and vitality of older adults, and the steady decline in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular mortality over recent decades, we do not think it is in good judgment to liberalize the treatment target in adults less than 80 years of age.

### Single mean arterial blood pressure drops during stroke thrombectomy under general anaesthesia are associated with poor outcome [^ba340a5c]. Journal of Neurology (2020). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Mechanical thrombectomy (MT) has become the recommended treatment for acute ischemic stroke caused by anterior circulation large vessel occlusion (LVO). While there is no debate regarding a higher chance for improved outcome with successful recanalization, it is not yet clear if MT should be performed under general anaesthesia (GA), conscious sedation (CS) or local anaesthesia alone. Recent single-centre randomized controlled trials found no difference in outcome between these approaches, while larger observational studies suggested a predominantly worse outcome for thrombectomy patients under GA.

One reason for this could be the greater challenge of blood pressure management during the induction of GA where post-induction hypotension is common due to cardio-depressive and vasodilatory side effects of most anaesthetic agents. There is, however, conflicting evidence whether hypotension during MT is independently related to worse outcome. Previous studies on the relation of blood pressure (BP) during MT and outcome also vary in their suggestions of BP target levels and whether absolute BP levels or relative changes in BP from pre-intervention levels are more critical. The 2018 AHA/ASA stroke guidelines note that BP should be kept ≤ 180/105 mmHg during MT and recommend correction of hypotension and hypovolemia but do not indicate what minimal BP should be maintained. Anaesthesiologic guidelines recommend preservation of a systolic BP > 140 mmHg during MT, but this is not based on hard data. It is also unclear whether systolic, diastolic or mean arterial blood pressure (SAP/DAP/MAP) has the greatest impact on outcome in the context of MT. Additionally, the influence of single critical BP drops during MT has not been investigated in depth and no specific cut-off values have been discovered yet. A commonly recommended minimal threshold for adequate cerebral blood flow autoregulation in the absence of increased intracranial pressure is a mean arterial pressure (MAP) ≥ 60 mmHg. Moreover, BP drops are likely particularly deleterious in patients with poor collaterals, but this has not been specifically investigated in MT patients thus far.

In view of these uncertainties, we explored the impact of different BP values (absolute and relative BP changes, SAP, DAP, and MAP) and their course during MT on outcome. Specifically, we hypothesized that critical BP drops of MAP ≤ 60 mmHg during MT were related to worse 3-month functional outcome. For this purpose, we analysed consecutive anterior LVO stroke patients who underwent GA for MT and had continuous invasive BP monitoring.

### Cardiovascular disease and risk management: standards of care in diabetes – 2025 [^dec691ee]. Diabetes Care (2025). High credibility.

Blood pressure targets in diabetes — intensive management reduces stroke and may allow goals below 130/80 mmHg if tolerated. Trials with achieved systolic blood pressures of < 135 mmHg versus < 140 mmHg reported a 10% reduction in all-cause mortality and a 17% reduction in stroke, and more intensive reduction to < 130 mmHg was associated with further stroke reduction but not other cardiovascular events. Meta-analyses indicate benefit is greatest when mean baseline blood pressure is ≥ 140/90 mmHg. A systematic review found reduced stroke (risk ratio 0.84 [95% CI 0.52–0.79]) and macroalbuminuria (0.77 [0.63–0.93]) with a posttreatment blood pressure of 125/73 mmHg, suggesting goals could be lowered from 130/80 mmHg if tolerated. This is consistent with guidance that advocates a goal of < 130/80 mmHg for all people. Potential adverse effects of antihypertensive therapy should also be taken into account, and low diastolic blood pressure is not necessarily a contraindication to more intensive management in otherwise standard care.

### Optimizing blood pressure in neurological emergencies [^0daf04ca]. Neurocritical Care (2004). Low credibility.

Excessive hypertension can challenge the brain's capacity to autoregulate cerebral blood flow, and can aggravate increased intracranial pressure (ICP) and cerebral edema. Hypotension may worsen ischemic damage in marginally perfused tissue, and in some cases can trigger cerebral vasodilation and ICP plateau waves. There is a lack of high-quality data regarding optimal BP management in these conditions. Existing guidelines for target BP levels are based largely on class III evidence. Class I data only exist for enteral candesartan and nimodipine use in acute ischemic stroke and aneurismal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), respectively, and for parenteral magnesium use in eclampsia. Class II data exist for reducing BP to < 180/105 mmHg in patients with ischemic stroke who are treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator, for elevating systolic BP to 180–220 mmHg in SAH patients with symptomatic vasospasm, and for maintaining cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) > 60 mmHg in traumatic brain injury. Short-acting continuous-infusion agents with a reliable dose-response relationship and favorable safety profile are desirable. To reduce BP, labetalol, esmolol, and nicardipine best meet these criteria. Sodium nitroprusside should be avoided in most neurological emergencies because of its tendency to raise ICP and cause toxicity with prolonged infusion. To elevate BP, the preferred agents are phenylephrine, dopamine, and norepinephrine.

### 2023 ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension the task force for the management of arterial hypertension of the European Society of Hypertension: endorsed by the international society of hypertension (ISH) and the European renal association (ERA) [^66916faf]. Journal of Hypertension (2023). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for hypertension, more specifically with respect to office BP measurement, ESH 2023 guidelines recommend to obtain office BP measurement for the diagnosis of HTN, as HTN-related risk, benefits of antihypertensive treatment, and treatment-related BP thresholds and goals are based on this method.

### Has the SPRINT trial introduced a new blood-pressure goal in hypertension? [^2e5f4dc5]. Nature Reviews: Cardiology (2017). Medium credibility.

SPRINT is the first randomized, controlled trial showing that a systolic blood-pressure goal of < 120 mmHg can be attained with cardiovascular benefits in a select group of patients with hypertension and an elevated cardiovascular risk with different origins. Although the patient population with characteristics like those in SPRINT makes up only 20–30% of the total hypertensive population, SPRINT is a landmark study that highlights the need to consider lower blood- pressure goals in the treatment of hypertension. Extending this study to include other patient populations and geographical areas is the next step for evaluating the benefits of strict blood-pressure targets and the generalizability of the SPRINT results. Importantly, the blood-pressure measurement method used in SPRINT differs from previous clinical trials, and raises the issue of whether a more accurate method should be used in clinical trials and if such method is feasible in clinical practice. This Perspectives article provides an analysis of the SPRINT data, focusing on patient characteristics, blood-pressure measurement method, and applicability of the SPRINT findings for future management guidelines.

### A case for less intensive blood pressure control: It matters to achieve target blood pressure early and sustained below 140 / 90mmHg [^a33b76ce]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2016). Low credibility.

Although high blood pressure (BP) is the leading risk factors for cardiovascular (CV) disease, the optimal BP treatment target in order to reduce CV risk is unclear in the aftermath of the SPRINT study. The aim of this review is to assess large, randomized, and controlled trials on BP targets, as well as review selected observational analyses from other large randomized BP trials in order to evaluate the benefit of intense vs. standard BP control. None of the studies, except SPRINT, favored intense BP treatment. Some of the studies suggested favorable effects of lowering treatment target in patients with diabetes or high risk of stroke. In SPRINT, a new BP measurement method was introduced, and the results must be interpreted in light of this. The results of the observational analyses indicated the best preventive effect when achieving early and sustained BP control rather than low targets. In conclusion, today's guidelines' recommended treatment target of < 140/90mmHg seems sufficient for most patients. Early and sustained BP control should be the main focus.

### Blood pressure load does not add to ambulatory blood pressure level for cardiovascular risk stratification [^f67c141c]. Hypertension (2014). Low credibility.

Experts proposed blood pressure (BP) load derived from 24-hour ambulatory BP recordings as a more accurate predictor of outcome than level, in particular in normotensive people. We analyzed 8711 subjects (mean age, 54.8 years; 47.0% women) randomly recruited from 10 populations. We expressed BP load as percentage (%) of systolic/diastolic readings ≥ 135/ ≥ 85 mm Hg and ≥ 120/ ≥ 70 mm Hg during day and night, respectively, or as the area under the BP curve (mm Hg×h) using the same ceiling values. During a period of 10.7 years (median), 1284 participants died and 1109 experienced a fatal or nonfatal cardiovascular end point. In multivariable-adjusted models, the risk of cardiovascular complications gradually increased across deciles of BP level and load (P < 0.001), but BP load did not substantially refine risk prediction based on 24-hour systolic or diastolic BP level (generalized R(2) statistic ≤ 0.294%; net reclassification improvement ≤ 0.28%; integrated discrimination improvement ≤ 0.001%). Systolic/diastolic BP load of 40.0/42.3% or 91.8/73.6 mm Hg×h conferred a 10-year risk of a composite cardiovascular end point similar to a 24-hour systolic/diastolic BP of 130/80 mm Hg. In analyses dichotomized according to these thresholds, increased BP load did not refine risk prediction in the whole study population (R(2) ≤ 0.051) or in untreated participants with 24-hour ambulatory normotension (R(2) ≤ 0.034). In conclusion, BP load does not improve risk stratification based on 24-hour BP level. This also applies to subjects with normal 24-hour BP for whom BP load was proposed to be particularly useful in risk stratification.

### Outcome-driven thresholds for ambulatory blood pressure based on the new American college of cardiology / American Heart Association classification of hypertension [^83b241c2]. Hypertension (2019). Medium credibility.

The new American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline reclassified office blood pressure and proposed thresholds for ambulatory blood pressure (ABP). We derived outcome-driven ABP thresholds corresponding with the new office blood pressure categories. We performed 24-hour ABP monitoring in 11152 participants (48.9% women; mean age, 53.0 years) representative of 13 populations. We determined ABP thresholds resulting in multivariable-adjusted 10-year risks similar to those associated with elevated office blood pressure (120/80 mmHg) and stages 1 and 2 of office hypertension (130/80 and 140/90 mmHg). Over 13.9 years (median), 2728 (rate per 1000 person-years, 17.9) people died, 1033 (6.8) from cardiovascular disease; furthermore, 1988 (13.8), 893 (6.0), and 795 (5.4) cardiovascular and coronary events and strokes occurred. Using a composite cardiovascular end point, systolic/diastolic outcome-driven thresholds indicating elevated 24-hour, daytime, and nighttime ABP were 117.9/75.2, 121.4/79.6, and 105.3/66.2 mmHg. For stages 1 and 2 ambulatory hypertension, thresholds were 123.3/75.2 and 128.7/80.7 mmHg for 24-hour ABP, 128.5/79.6 and 135.6/87.1 mmHg for daytime ABP, and 111.7/66.2 and 118.1/72.5 mmHg for nighttime ABP. ABP thresholds derived from other end points were similar. After rounding, approximate thresholds for elevated 24-hour, daytime, and nighttime ABP were 120/75, 120/80, and 105/65 mmHg, and for stages 1 and 2, ambulatory hypertension 125/75 and 130/80 mmHg, 130/80 and 135/85 mmHg, and 110/65 and 120/70 mmHg. Outcome-driven ABP thresholds corresponding to elevated blood pressure and stages 1 and 2 of hypertension are similar to those proposed by the current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline.

### KDIGO 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in chronic kidney Disease [^cf989ea4]. Kidney International (2021). High credibility.

Chronic kidney disease blood pressure management — tolerance of intensive systolic blood pressure (SBP) targets and standardized measurement are emphasized: Severe hypertension, such as SBP ≥ 180 mm Hg on no or 1 antihypertensive drug, or ≥ 150 mm Hg on > 4 antihypertensive drugs, were not included in SPRINT; if the patient cannot tolerate SBP < 120 mm Hg despite a slow, gradual decrease over months, efforts should be made to maintain SBP < 130 mm Hg, < 140 mm Hg, or an even higher tolerated SBP goal. The importance of standardized BP measurement is stressed, as routine, non-standardized office BP often overestimates BP versus standardized conditions, no correction factor can be used to convert routine to standardized measurements by calculation, the use of routine measurements to adjust therapy confers a serious risk of overtreatment and sometimes undertreatment, and the most important recommendation is the use of standardized measurements.

### Association of elevated blood pressure in the emergency department with chronically elevated blood pressure [^638711fe]. Journal of the American Heart Association (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypertension affects more than one‐third of adults in the United States, and hypertension‐related emergency department (ED) visits are increasing. 1, 2 Although the spectrum of acuity for hypertension‐related ED visits ranges widely, true hypertensive emergencies, such as acute heart failure in which acute BP reduction (< 24 hours) is warranted, are rare. 3, 4 For the much more common ED visits with asymptomatic elevated BP, rapid BP reduction can cause significant harm by impairing cerebral blood flow and has not been shown to improve clinical outcomes. 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 The American College of Emergency Physicians' policy recommendation on asymptomatic elevated BP in the ED reflects current lack of evidence to guide evaluation and treatment; based on expert opinion or panel consensus (level C evidence), it states that although all patients with asymptomatic elevated BP should be referred for follow‐up, routine ED testing and treatment are not needed but can be considered for those with poor follow‐up. 10

The risk of elevated BP after an ED visit and thresholds for classifying BP in the ED were not addressed by the American College of Emergency Physicians policy recommendation. Recent American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines revising the threshold for hypertension to 130/80 mm Hg among high‐risk patients adds urgency to addressing this evidence gap, as many ED patients are likely to meet these new criteria for hypertension and also have insufficient access to other sources of care. 11

There are several long‐standing barriers to using BP measured in the ED as part of diagnosing and treating hypertension. One barrier is uncertainty regarding the validity of BP measured in the ED. Despite some evidence to the contrary, BP measured in the ED is often disregarded because of concerns about measurement accuracy or because BP elevations attributed to pain, anxiety, or illness are presumed to be temporary and clinically unimportant. 12, 13 Questions about whether the ED can or should serve as a location of care to manage chronic diseases, such as hypertension, contribute to variation in how elevated BP in the ED is evaluated and treated. 14, 15, 16 Such variations in practice patterns due to lack of evidence are likely to result in worse health outcomes overall. 17

### Clinical policy: critical issues in the evaluation and management of adult patients with asymptomatic hypertension in the emergency department [^b6eace0b]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2006). Medium credibility.

Definitions and measurement framework emphasize JNC 7 categories and scope. The definitions of hypertension used in this report are those developed by JNC 7 and include normal, prehypertension, stage 1 hypertension, and stage 2 hypertension, and acute hypertensive emergencies are not addressed by this policy. Classification is based on the average of 2 or more properly measured, seated blood pressure readings on each of 2 or more office visits. JNC 7 defined prehypertension as systolic blood pressure of 120 to 139 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure of 80 to 89 mm Hg, and patients with prehypertension are at increased risk for progression to hypertension; those in the 120–139 mm Hg systolic or 80–89 mm Hg diastolic range are at twice the risk to develop hypertension as those with lower values. The table applies to adults aged 18 years or older.

### Commentary on the 2014 BP guidelines from the panel appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^e9337161]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2014). Low credibility.

The recently published article "2014 Evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: Report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8)" (James et al. JAMA 311: 507–520, 2014) has generated considerable controversy. In this commentary, we evaluate the document and compare the recommendations contained within it with those of the JNC 7 and other national and international guidelines. The evidence quality rating approach followed by the article "2014 Evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: Report from the panel members appointed to the Eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8)" (James et al. JAMA 311: 507–520, 2014) disqualified nearly 98% of previous studies from review; as a result, some of the key recommendations were on the basis of expert opinion alone. We are especially concerned that the recommendation to raise the systolic/diastolic BP levels at which treatment is initiated to ≥ 150/ ≥ 90 mmHg in adults ≥ 60 years old may affect cardiovascular and renal health in these patients. Additionally, we recommend that hypertension guidelines should be updated every 3–4 years with a fresh approach to the definition of target BP levels, the use of modern technology in the diagnosis of hypertension, and the treatment of hypertension in special populations not addressed in earlier guidelines.

### European Stroke Organisation (ESO) guideline on cerebral small vessel disease, part 2, lacunar ischaemic stroke [^11953089]. European Stroke Journal (2024). Medium credibility.

Other guidelines

To our knowledge, no previous guideline has focused specifically on acute BP lowering in patients with lacunar ischaemic stroke. Recent guidelines on blood pressure management in acute ischaemic stroke at large are summarised below as a point of comparison:

The previously published ESO guideline (Table 1), with which we concur, suggests against routine BP lowering in the pre-hospital setting and in the first 24 h following symptom onset in hospitalised patients with any acute ischaemic stroke and BP < 220/110 mmHg not treated with intravenous thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy (unless necessary for a comorbid condition). In patients with any acute ischaemic stroke undergoing intravenous thrombolysis it suggests maintaining BP below 185/110 mmHg before bolus and below 180/105 mmHg after bolus, and for 24 h after alteplase infusion. The guideline also states that there is continued uncertainty over the benefits and risks (advantages/disadvantages) of continuing versus temporarily stopping previous blood pressure lowering therapy. Moreover, although the effects of blood pressure lowering in acute ischaemic stroke patients with SBP > 220 mmHg are unknown, as such patients were excluded in most RCTs, careful blood pressure reduction (< 15% SBP in 24 h) was deemed reasonable and likely to be safe in an Expert Consensus Statement.

The current US guidelines for acute ischaemic stroke regardless of stroke subtype are to allow patients to autoregulate blood pressure to maintain perfusion for 24 h, up to a SBP of 220 mmHg for patients who did not receive alteplase and 180 mmHg for those who received tPA.

The Chinese guidelines for BP management in the acute phase of ischaemic stroke do not provide any specific guideline for the lacunar ischaemic stroke subtype either. For patients with BP < 220/120 mmHg, who do not receive IV alteplase or endovascular treatment and do not have complications requiring emergency antihypertensive treatment, this guideline states that starting or restarting antihypertensive therapy within the first 48–72 h after AIS is not effective in preventing death or severe disability. For patients with BP ⩾220/120 mmHg, who do not receive IV alteplase or endovascular treatment and do not have complications requiring emergency antihypertensive treatment, the effect of starting or restarting antihypertensive therapy within the first 48–72 h after AIS is uncertain. The guideline states that it may be reasonable to reduce BP by 15% within the first 24 h after stroke.

### KDIGO 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in chronic kidney Disease [^415bd536]. Kidney International (2021). High credibility.

KDIGO 2021 diastolic blood pressure (DBP) guidance in CKD: The Work Group chose not to provide a DBP target alongside SBP < 120 mm Hg because achievement of SBP < 120 mm Hg will almost certainly result in DBP < 70 mm Hg in the great majority of patients; prior trials used a mean arterial pressure (MAP) target of < 92 mm Hg (often considered equivalent to 125/75 mm Hg, and also 116/80, 135/70, 140/68, 145/65). For young patients with CKD and diastolic hypertension, it seems reasonable to target DBP to < 80 mm Hg in addition to an SBP target < 120 mm Hg, but the Work Group is hesitant to recommend a DBP target because of the lack of evidence.

### 2025 AHA / ACC / AANP / AAPA / ABC / ACCP / ACPM / AGS / AMA / ASPC / NMA / PCNA / SGIM guideline for the prevention, detection, evaluation and management of high blood pressure in adults: a report of the American college of cardiology / American Heart Association joint committee on clinical practice guidelines [^34cd81fe]. Hypertension (2025). High credibility.

Perioperative blood pressure thresholds, risk stratification, and beta-blocker initiation/withdrawal: There is conflicting evidence for patients with diastolic BP (DBP) > 110 mm Hg regarding recommending delay of surgery, and in a systematic review and meta-analysis, preoperative hypertension was associated with a 35% increase in cardiovascular complications; an increase in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications and renal failure has been reported in patients with DBP > 110 mm Hg immediately before surgery, whereas patients with DBP < 110 mm Hg do not appear to be at significantly increased risk. During induction of anesthesia, a sympathetic reaction can result in a 20 to 30 mm Hg increase in BP, and an elevated BP on the day of surgery may represent "white-coat hypertension"; therefore referring to patients' baseline ambulatory BP is recommended to guide BP management. Without evidence for increased risk for perioperative complications in patients whose preoperative systolic/diastolic BP is < 180/110 mm Hg, there is little evidence to defer surgery and BP can be controlled postoperatively or after discharge. Although few studies describe risks of withdrawing BB in the perioperative period, longstanding evidence suggests that abrupt withdrawal of long-term BB is harmful and should be avoided; there are fewer data to describe whether short-term (1 to 2 days) perioperative use of BB followed by rapid discontinuation is harmful, and abrupt discontinuation of clonidine can result in rebound hypertension associated with norepinephrine surge. This guideline recommends against starting a BB on the day of surgery in BB-naïve patients, particularly at high initial doses, in long-acting form, and if there are no plans for dose titration or monitoring for adverse events.

### A clinical trial to evaluate the effect of statin use on lowering aldosterone levels [^0ea26de9]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2020). Medium credibility.

Safety and monitoring

Blood pressure

During the angiotensin II infusion, blood pressure will be measured every 2 min by an automated sphygmomanometer (Dinamap, General Electric Healthcare, Chicago IL) and monitored throughout the duration of the infusion by a trained research observer. IV infusion of angiotensin II is expected to increase blood pressure. If during the infusion the diastolic blood pressure rises above 105 mmHg or the systolic blood pressure rises above 180 mmHg on three consecutive readings, verified by a manual cuff reading, the infusion will be terminated. If participants develop symptoms such as headache, chest pain, palpitations, or nausea, the infusion will be terminated, and appropriate medical attention provided. The use of angiotensin II in this protocol will be identical to previous protocols and has been performed safely and without event in over 1250 participants. Blood pressure measurements will be collected for 10 min post-infusion to ensure a return to baseline blood pressure, and the principal investigator will review all collected blood pressure measurements.

Study drugs: simvastatin and pravastatin

Statin drugs (simvastatin and pravastatin) will be used in this study. They may be used "off label" in that some individuals without hypercholesterolemia or indication for statin therapy will receive these medications. To reduce the risk of side effects, all participants will be screened for predisposing conditions prior to enrollment, and participants will be contacted weekly to assess for development of symptoms of drug-related side effects, including myopathy, transaminitis, rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, upper respiratory infection, headache, abdominal pain, constipation, and nausea. If symptoms suggest possible side effects, an additional study visit, including lab work, may be required to evaluate further. Depending on this evaluation, patients may be discontinued from the study and appropriate clinical follow-up arranged.

Laboratory results

All laboratory studies are reviewed by a study physician. Clinically significant abnormalities will either result in a redraw or immediate exclusion. Clinically significant abnormalities will be discussed with the participant by a study physician who will advise follow-up.

Data safety monitoring plan

Data and safety will be monitored during a monthly research group meeting. The Cardiovascular Endocrinology Research Group includes more than 5 patient-oriented clinical investigators who are all endocrinologists with detailed knowledge of human participants research and the medications used in this study. At each meeting, study staff present recruitment status, adverse events or safety issues, protocol deviations, and other pertinent study-related issues to the group. The Cardiovascular Endocrinology Research Group reviews each adverse event and formulates a plan to address it.

### KDIGO 2021 clinical practice guideline for the management of blood pressure in chronic kidney Disease [^4ad2f075]. Kidney International (2021). High credibility.

KDIGO 2021 — implementation, populations, and home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) emphasize that shared decision-making with individual patients is essential, and the evidence for intensive SBP targets is more certain in those who would have been eligible for SPRINT and less certain in people with diabetes, advanced CKD with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 30 ml/min per 1.73 m2, older adults aged > 90 years, and those with severe hypertension (SBP > 180 mm Hg). Although there is strong evidence that home BP measurements are predictive of long-term adverse clinical outcomes, no adequately powered trial for guiding antihypertensive medication based on home BP targets has been reported; nonetheless, HBPM may help to improve patient motivation and adherence and can be used to identify masked hypertension, masked uncontrolled hypertension, white-coat hypertension, and the white-coat effect. Economic analyses using SPRINT data suggest that intensive SBP treatment is cost-effective, but in countries in which resources are limited it is probably more important to ensure that all eligible patients have at least reasonable BP control (e.g. SBP < 140 mm Hg) than to focus on achieving intensive BP control in a smaller fraction of patients.

### Trends in utilization of lipid-and blood pressure-lowering agents and goal attainment among the U.S. diabetic population, 1999–2008 [^daa84e77]. Cardiovascular Diabetology (2011). Low credibility.

Similarly, CV outcomes trials of antihypertensive agents demonstrating the clinical benefit of aggressive treatment to BP targets in patients with diabetes may also have contributed to the significant increase in the use of BP-lowering medications by this group in the past decade. In 1998, the U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) compared tight control of BP to < 150/85 mmHg versus less-tight control of BP to < 180/105 mmHg in hypertensive diabetic patients. The observed reductions in relative risk in patients allocated to tight BP control were 24% for diabetes-related end points (which included sudden death, myocardial infarction, angina, heart failure, and stroke), 32% for deaths related to diabetes (which included death due to myocardial infarction, sudden death, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease), and 44% for stroke. A subgroup analysis of the diabetic cohort within the Hypertension Optimal Treatment (HOT) trial, where hypertensive patients were randomly assigned to a target diastolic BP, found that the risk of major CV events was halved in those randomized to ≤ 80 mmHg versus ≤ 90 mmHg. However, while trials such as these have generally indicated that aggressive BP control is effective in reducing the risk of CV complications of diabetes, recent results have questioned the clinical benefit of lowering BP levels to within the normotensive range. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial, where diabetic patients were targeted to a systolic BP < 120 mmHg versus < 140 mmHg, did not demonstrate a significant reduction in the relative risk of major CV events but did show a significant reduction in stroke risk. Similarly, a subgroup analysis from the International Verapamil SR-Trandolapril Study (INVEST) found that, among diabetic patients with CHD, strict control of systolic BP (< 130 mmHg) was not associated with improved CV outcomes in comparison with usual control (130 mmHg to < 140 mmHg). Nevertheless, despite recent debate around intensive BP control, the finding from our analysis that nearly half of all U.S. adults with diabetes are not meeting the current recommendations around LDL-C or BP treatment goals is of concern, and may have serious implications for the future CVD burden in this population.

### Exercise blood pressure and future cardiovascular death in asymptomatic individuals [^c94b2053]. Circulation (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Individuals with exaggerated exercise blood pressure (BP) tend to develop future hypertension. It is controversial whether they have higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Methods and Results

A total of 6578 asymptomatic Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence Study participants (45% women; mean age, 46 years; 74% with untreated baseline BP < 140/90 mm Hg [nonhypertensive]) performing submaximal Bruce treadmill tests were followed for 20 years (385 CVD deaths occurred). Systolic and diastolic BP at rest, Bruce stage 2, and maximal BP during exercise were significantly associated with CVD death. When we compared multivariate hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals per 10/5-mm Hg BP increments, the association was strongest for rest BP (systolic, 1.21 [1.14 to 1.27]; diastolic, 1.20 [1.14 to 1.26]), then Bruce stage 2 BP (systolic, 1.09 [1.04 to 1.14]; diastolic, 1.09 [1.05 to 1.13]), then maximal exercise BP (systolic, 1.06 [1.01 to 1.10]; diastolic, 1.04 [1.01 to 1.08]). Overall, exercise BP was not significant after adjustment for rest BP. However, hypertension status modified the risk associated with exercise BP (P(interaction) = 0.03). Among nonhypertensives, whether they had normal BP (< 120/80 mm Hg) or prehypertension, Bruce stage 2 BP > 180/90 versus ≤ 180/90 mm Hg carried increased risk independent of rest BP and risk factors (adjusted hazard ratio for systolic, 1.96 [1.40 to 2.74], P < 0.001; diastolic, 1.48 [1.06 to 2.06], P = 0.02) and added predictive value (net reclassification improvement, systolic, 12.0% [-0.1% to 24.2%]; diastolic, 9.9% [-0.3% to 20.0%]; relative integrated discrimination improvement, 14.3% and 12.0%, respectively).

Conclusions

In asymptomatic individuals, elevated exercise BP carried higher risk of CVD death but became nonsignificant after accounting for rest BP. However, Bruce stage 2 BP > 180/90 mm Hg identified nonhypertensive individuals at higher risk of CVD death.

### Blood pressure targets in adults with hypertension [^7aa404b6]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

This is the first update of this review first published in 2009. When treating elevated blood pressure, doctors usually try to achieve a blood pressure target. That target is the blood pressure value below which the optimal clinical benefit is supposedly obtained. "The lower the better" approach that guided the treatment of elevated blood pressure for many years was challenged during the last decade due to lack of evidence from randomised trials supporting that strategy. For that reason, the standard blood pressure target in clinical practice during the last years has been less than 140/90 mm Hg for the general population of patients with elevated blood pressure. However, new trials published in recent years have reintroduced the idea of trying to achieve lower blood pressure targets. Therefore, it is important to know whether the benefits outweigh harms when attempting to achieve targets lower than the standard target.

Objectives

The primary objective was to determine if lower blood pressure targets (any target less than or equal to 135/85 mm Hg) are associated with reduction in mortality and morbidity as compared with standard blood pressure targets (less than or equal to 140/ 90 mm Hg) for the treatment of patients with chronic arterial hypertension. The secondary objectives were: to determine if there is a change in mean achieved systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP associated with "lower targets" as compared with "standard targets" in patients with chronic arterial hypertension; and to determine if there is a change in withdrawals due to adverse events with "lower targets" as compared with "standard targets", in patients with elevated blood pressure.

The Cochrane Hypertension Information Specialist searched the following databases for randomised controlled trials up to May 2019: the Cochrane Hypertension Specialised Register, CENTRAL (2019, Issue 4), Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also contacted authors of relevant papers regarding further published and unpublished work. The searches had no language restrictions.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing patients allocated to lower or to standard blood pressure targets (see above).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (JAA, VL) independently assessed the included trials and extracted data. Primary outcomes were total mortality; total serious adverse events; myocardial infarction, stroke, congestive heart failure, end stage renal disease, and other serious adverse events. Secondary outcomes were achieved mean SBP and DBP, withdrawals due to adverse effects, and mean number of antihypertensive drugs used. We assessed the risk of bias of each trial using the Cochrane risk of bias tool and the certainty of the evidence using the GRADE approach. MAIN RESULTS: This update includes 11 RCTs involving 38,688 participants with a mean follow-up of 3.7 years. This represents 7 new RCTs compared with the original version. At baseline the mean weighted age was 63.1 years and the mean weighted blood pressure was 155/91 mm Hg. Lower targets do not reduce total mortality (risk ratio (RR) 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.86 to 1.05; 11 trials, 38,688 participants; high-certainty evidence) and do not reduce total serious adverse events (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.08; 6 trials, 18,165 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). This means that the benefits of lower targets do not outweigh the harms as compared to standard blood pressure targets. Lower targets may reduce myocardial infarction (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.96; 6 trials, 18,938 participants, absolute risk reduction (ARR) 0.4%, number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 250 over 3.7 years) and congestive heart failure (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.92; 5 trials, 15,859 participants, ARR 0.6%, NNTB 167 over 3.7 years) (low-certainty for both outcomes). Reduction in myocardial infarction and congestive heart failure was not reflected in total serious adverse events. This may be due to an increase in other serious adverse events (RR 1.44, 95% CI 1.32 to 1.59; 6 trials. 18,938 participants, absolute risk increase (ARI) 3%, number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 33 over four years) (low-certainty evidence). Participants assigned to a "lower" target received one additional antihypertensive medication and achieved a significantly lower mean SBP (122.8 mm Hg versus 135.0 mm Hg, and a lower mean DBP (82.0 mm Hg versus 85.2 mm Hg, than those assigned to "standard target".

Authors' Conclusions

For the general population of persons with elevated blood pressure, the benefits of trying to achieve a lower blood pressure target rather than a standard target (≤ 140/90 mm Hg) do not outweigh the harms associated with that intervention. Further research is needed to see if some groups of patients would benefit or be harmed by lower targets. The results of this review are primarily applicable to older people with moderate to high cardiovascular risk. They may not be applicable to other populations.

### 2014 evidence-based guideline for the management of high blood pressure in adults: report from the panel members appointed to the eighth Joint National Committee (JNC 8) [^3477554a]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

JNC 8 Recommendation 3 — Adults younger than 60 years: Based on expert opinion, the panel recommends an SBP treatment threshold of 140 mm Hg or higher and an SBP treatment goal of lower than 140 mm Hg for persons younger than 60 years, noting that the panel found insufficient evidence from good- or fair-quality RCTs to support a specific SBP threshold or goal for this age group.
