## Question

In a 24-year-old woman with erythematous papules on her shins and an elevated EST, what is the most likely diagnosis?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what the most likely diagnosis is in a 24-year-old woman with erythematous papules on the shins and an elevated ESR, and whether the clinical pattern fits a specific condition versus key differentials. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the morphology and distribution of the lesions and whether they point to a classic entity. Then, I should verify epidemiology and systemic markers like ESR for consistency. Next, I will review distinguishing features to separate look-alike conditions (erythema multiforme, nodular vasculitis, pretibial myxedema, cellulitis). Finally, I should synthesize the evidence and confirm the most likely diagnosis while considering next steps in evaluation, just to ensure I am not missing an underlying systemic trigger [^113F39rh].

> Let me first confirm the clinicoanatomic pattern. Painful, erythematous, raised lesions on the anterior tibial surface classically point toward erythema nodosum, the most common form of panniculitis with a predilection for the pretibial shins and a symmetric, bilateral distribution, typically nonulcerative and resolving without scarring, which fits this description well [^113Vjjj8] [^112ezHfy] [^114nhw2a].

> I should confirm the demographic fit. Hold on, let me verify the age–sex epidemiology: erythema nodosum occurs most often from the teens through the 30s and shows a marked female predominance, which aligns with a 24-year-old woman, strengthening pretest probability for EN in this scenario [^113Vjjj8] [^112PiVyi].

> Next, I need to check whether the elevated ESR makes sense. Elevated acute phase reactants, including ESR and/or CRP, are commonly seen in EN, and cohort data show mean ESR values in adults well above normal at presentation, so the reported elevated ESR is congruent with EN and supports an inflammatory panniculitis rather than a purely superficial dermatosis [^112ezHfy] [^115rkh5r].

> Wait, I should double-check the morphology wording. The vignette says "erythematous papules", but the hallmark of EN is tender subcutaneous nodules rather than true papules; that said, clinical descriptions sometimes conflate raised lesions, and early or less prominent EN can be described imprecisely as papules. Let me reconsider: if these are pretibial, tender, raised lesions with supportive labs, the mislabeling of papules versus nodules would not overturn the leading diagnosis of EN, but I need to ensure there is subcutaneous tenderness and no ulceration to stay aligned with EN's typical morphology and course [^112ezHfy] [^114nhw2a].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — what about key differentials? I will now examine erythema multiforme: EM typically presents with acral "target" or "iris" lesions with three concentric zones, often with mucosal involvement, which does not match pretibial nodules and would be an anatomic and morphologic mismatch here, making EM less likely [^1166U3Du] [^115UAroo].

> I should review nodular vasculitis (erythema induratum) next. Nodular vasculitis is a lobular panniculitis often associated with TB, typically showing vasculitis histologically and a posterior lower leg distribution; clinically it can mimic EN, but the classic symmetric anterior tibial distribution and epidemiologic fit here still favor EN over nodular vasculitis in the absence of features suggesting erythema induratum or tuberculosis triggers in the history provided [^1115ycX1].

> But wait, what if this were pretibial myxedema or another pretibial process? Pretibial myxedema presents as non-tender, indurated plaques in association with Graves' disease rather than tender acute nodules, and the vignette lacks thyroid-associated stigmata; similarly, common infectious cellulitis tends to be unilateral with warmth and systemic toxicity rather than symmetric pretibial nodularity, which again tilts the balance toward EN in this clinical frame [^112yd6Qh] [^notfound].

> Synthesizing this, the convergence of classic site (pretibial shins), typical age–sex epidemiology, compatible inflammatory labs (elevated ESR), and a morphology that — despite the "papule" wording — fits tender subcutaneous pretibial lesions strongly supports erythema nodosum as the most likely diagnosis. I should confirm that the lesions are tender and subcutaneous on exam, and if EN is diagnosed, I need to consider a targeted evaluation for common triggers (streptococcal infection, TB risk, sarcoidosis, IBD, medications) per guidelines, but the primary clinical diagnosis here is erythema nodosum [^113Vjjj8] [^112ezHfy] [^114SFc7U].

---

The most likely diagnosis is **erythema nodosum (EN)** [^112ezHfy], given the classic presentation of tender erythematous papules on the shins [^114nhw2a] with an elevated ESR [^115rkh5r] in a young adult female [^113Vjjj8]. EN is a **septal panniculitis** most often on the anterior shins [^114nhw2a], frequently with systemic symptoms [^113Vjjj8] and elevated inflammatory markers [^112ezHfy]. Common triggers include streptococcal infection, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, medications, and pregnancy [^114SFc7U]; about half are idiopathic [^112ezHfy] [^113Vjjj8]. Diagnosis is **clinical**, supported by ESR/CRP and targeted testing for underlying causes [^114SFc7U]; biopsy is reserved for atypical cases. Management is supportive with NSAIDs and rest [^1115ycX1], plus treatment of any identified trigger [^112ezHfy]; prognosis is excellent [^113Vjjj8] with spontaneous resolution in weeks to months [^115JHd9e] [^114SFc7U].

---

## Clinical features of erythema nodosum

EN typically presents with the following **clinical features**:

- **Lesion characteristics**: Tender, erythematous, slightly raised nodules or papules, 1–6 cm [^114nhw2a], often symmetric on the anterior shins [^113Vjjj8].

- **Systemic symptoms**: Fever, malaise, and arthralgias are common [^114nhw2a] [^113Vjjj8].

- **Course**: Lesions resolve without ulceration, atrophy, or scarring over 2–8 weeks [^1115ycX1] [^114nhw2a].

- **Inflammatory markers**: ESR and CRP are often elevated [^112ezHfy] [^115rkh5r].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **differential diagnosis** for erythematous papules on the shins with an elevated ESR includes:

| **Condition** | **Clinical features** | **Distinguishing features** |
|-|-|-|
| Erythema nodosum | - Tender, erythematous nodules on shins <br/> - Elevated ESR <br/> - Systemic symptoms | Septal panniculitis without vasculitis [^114nhw2a] |
| Erythema multiforme | - Target lesions <br/> - Mucosal involvement <br/> - Often HSV or Mycoplasma | - Target lesions <br/> - Mucosal involvement [^113RjPSJ] [^1166U3Du] [^115UAroo] |
| Sweet syndrome | - Tender, erythematous plaques <br/> - Fever <br/> - Neutrophilia | Dense neutrophilic dermal infiltrate [^1167gEH2] [^116dTwgp] |
| Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa | - Painful nodules <br/> - Livedo reticularis <br/> - Systemic symptoms | Medium-vessel vasculitis on biopsy [^1128pTUK] |
| Sarcoidosis | - Erythema nodosum <br/> - Systemic involvement | Noncaseating granulomas on biopsy [^112yd6Qh] |

---

EN best fits the described presentation, especially in a young adult woman [^112ezHfy].

---

## Etiology and associated conditions

EN is a **hypersensitivity reaction** to various antigenic stimuli [^114SFc7U], and about 50% of cases are idiopathic [^112ezHfy] [^113Vjjj8]. Common associated conditions include:

- **Infections**: Streptococcal pharyngitis [^112ezHfy], tuberculosis [^1119rQXk], Mycoplasma, Yersinia [^113LeJeG], Salmonella [^115ufkYY], Campylobacter, Coccidioides, Histoplasma [^113LeJeG], Bartonella [^1161Lnko], Cryptococcus [^1119iBpz] [^115ENTNX], COVID-19 [^114HoXrY].

- **Inflammatory diseases**: Sarcoidosis [^112ezHfy], inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn's, ulcerative colitis) [^116Kh3gB], Behçet disease [^114SFc7U].

- **Medications**: Oral contraceptives [^112ezHfy], sulfonamides, penicillins, nevirapine [^114pnnWM], dapsone [^111PtM5B], dupilumab [^112avsY7] [^112iaV82], everolimus [^111XXZXL], tyrosine kinase inhibitors [^114Qrgge].

- **Pregnancy**: Hormonal changes can trigger EN [^112ezHfy] [^114SFc7U].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

The diagnosis is primarily clinical, supported by laboratory and imaging studies. Recommended **laboratory tests** include CBC, ESR [^115rkh5r], CRP, ASO titer, throat culture, TB testing (PPD or IGRA), chest X-ray, and targeted tests based on suspicion [^114SFc7U]. Biopsy is reserved for atypical or persistent cases and shows **septal panniculitis without vasculitis** [^112ezHfy].

---

## Management

Management focuses on **symptomatic relief** and treatment of underlying causes:

- **Supportive care**: NSAIDs, rest, leg elevation, compression stockings [^1115ycX1] [^112ezHfy].

- **Treat underlying cause**: Antibiotics for infections [^112ezHfy], corticosteroids or immunosuppressives for inflammatory diseases [^114SFc7U] [^1115ycX1], discontinue offending drugs [^112ezHfy].

- **Prognosis**: Excellent; lesions resolve in 2–8 weeks without scarring [^113Vjjj8] [^112ezHfy].

---

The most likely diagnosis in a 24-year-old female with erythematous papules on her shins and elevated ESR is **erythema nodosum**, a septal panniculitis often triggered by infections, inflammatory diseases, medications, or pregnancy.

### Erythema nodosum [^114nhw2a]. Clinics in Dermatology (2007). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum (EN) is the most common form of panniculitis. It is characterized by the presence of rounded or oval, slightly raised, nonulcerative painful red nodules in the skin and subcutaneous fatty tissue, measuring 1 to 6 cm in diameter, sometimes coalescing. They tend to be symmetrical in distribution and are usually located bilaterally on the lower extremities, particularly on the anterior tibial surface, although they may also involve the ankles, the lower parts of the thighs, and the forearms.

### Erythema nodosum: A sign of systemic disease [^112ezHfy]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum, a painful disorder of the subcutaneous fat, is the most common type of panniculitis. Generally, it is idiopathic, although the most common identifiable cause is streptococcal pharyngitis. It may be the first sign of a systemic disease such as tuberculosis, bacterial or deep fungal infection, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, or cancer. Certain drugs, including oral contraceptives and some antibiotics, may also be etiologic.

The hallmark of erythema nodosum is tender, erythematous, subcutaneous nodules that are typically located symmetrically on the anterior surface of the lower extremities. It does not ulcerate and usually resolves without atrophy or scarring. Most direct and indirect evidence supports the involvement of a type IV delayed hypersensitivity response to numerous antigens. A deep incisional or excisional biopsy specimen should be obtained for adequate visualization.

Erythema nodosum represents an inflammatory process involving the septa between subcutaneous fat lobules, with an absence of vasculitis and the presence of radial granulomas. Diagnostic evaluation following a comprehensive history and physical examination includes complete blood count with differential; erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, or both; testing for streptococcal infection (i.e. throat culture, rapid antigen test, antistreptolysin-O titer, and polymerase chain reaction assay); and biopsy. Patients should be stratified by risk for tuberculosis, with further evaluation such as a purified protein derivative test and chest radiography.

### Erythema nodosum: A practical approach and diagnostic algorithm [^114SFc7U]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2021). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum is the most common form of panniculitis and is characterized by tender erythematous nodules, mainly located on the pretibial area of the lower limbs. The exact cause of erythema nodosum is unknown. However, it appears to be a hypersensitivity response to a variety of antigenic stimuli. Although the etiology is mostly idiopathic, it is imperative to rule out underlying disease before diagnosing primary erythema nodosum. Erythema nodosum can be the first sign of a systemic disease triggered by various processes such as infections, inflammatory diseases, neoplasia, or drugs. The most common identifiable causes include streptococcal infections, primary tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, Behçet's disease, inflammatory bowel disease, drugs, and pregnancy.

We propose a diagnostic algorithm to optimize the initial work-up, thereby initiating prompt and accurate management of the underlying disease. The algorithm includes an initial assessment of core symptoms, diagnostic work-up, differential diagnosis, and recommended therapies. Several treatment options for the erythema nodosum lesions have been previously reported; nevertheless, these options treat the symptoms but not the triggering cause. Making an accurate diagnosis allows the physician to treat the underlying cause and determine an optimal therapeutic strategy.

In 18.3% (n = 26) of cases, a skin biopsy was taken to confirm the diagnosis, most commonly among those aged ≥ 40 years (p < 0.01). At the time of diagnosing erythema nodosum, a chest X-ray was performed in most cases (89.4%), but least often in the youngest age group (p = 0.039). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was analyzed in 127 out of 142 (89.4%) of the cases. The mean (SD, min-max) value was 39.3 mm/h (28.9, 2.0–104.0) in children (normal range, 1–15 mm/h) and 44.4 mm/h (28.0, 2.0–107.0) in adults (normal range, varying from < 10 to < 45 depending on age and sex).

### An unusual presentation of Vilanova disease (erythema nodosum migrans) with superficial histologic changes [^114KHt6j]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum migrans (ENM) is a rare clinical variant of erythema nodosum (EN). It is a septal panniculitis characterized by asymmetrical, mildly tender nodules that migrate over time. Fever, sore throat, or arthralgias may also accompany the cutaneous manifestations of the disease; however, this is uncommon. The treatment of choice for ENM is potassium iodide. We present a case of a 77-year-old woman with a five-month history of ENM that was treated successfully with topical clobetasol.

### An unusual presentation of Vilanova disease (erythema nodosum migrans) with superficial histologic changes [^115xQrmH]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

This case highlights the importance of considering erythema nodosum migrans (ENM) in the differential diagnosis of suspected morphea, necrobiosis lipoidica, and lower limb cellulitis. Some variants of the disease may present with vascular changes in the dermis, as observed in our case. This finding is quite atypical, and the diagnosis is primarily based on the characteristic septal subcutaneous panniculitis. Although ENM is a variant of erythema nodosum (EN), obtaining the correct diagnosis is essential for appropriate management and patient care.

### Exploring the combination of SSKI and topical heparin in a case of erythema nodosum migrans [^114zPixg]. Dermatologic Therapy (2018). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum migrans (subacute nodular migratory panniculitis) is an uncommon type of panniculitis characterized by migrating subcutaneous nodules or plaques on the lower extremity. Very few cases of erythema nodosum migrans have been reported, thus its appropriate treatment modality is not defined. We describe a case of a 30-year-old male with idiopathic erythema nodosum migrans, which manifested as a centrifugally spreading, slightly morpheaform erythematous plaque on the lower left leg. The patient was initially diagnosed and treated as a case of furunculosis with poor clinical response. The skin biopsy showed features consistent with subacute nodular panniculitis. Saturated solution of potassium iodide, along with topical heparin, successfully treated the patient when conventional treatment modalities failed. In a morpheaform centrifugally expanded plaque, erythema nodosum migrans should be considered in the differential diagnosis, especially in the lower extremities in cases of unknown etiology.

### Crohn's disease: A clinical update [^116Kh3gB]. Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology (2015). High credibility.

Crohn's disease can be associated with a variety of symptoms and conditions such as weight loss, digital clubbing, erythema nodosum, and epigastric abdominal pain. Inflammation and fever often accompany these symptoms.

Recent use of NSAIDs may exacerbate abdominal pain, and patients might also experience pyoderma gangrenosum, painful joints, and mouth sores. This disease affects a diverse demographic, including those of Eastern European descent. Chronic lower abdominal pain may occur, and patients could develop kidney stones and scleritis. Anemia is common, and some individuals may pass blood in stools.

This disease is characterized by the presence of ⊕ p-ANCA and ⊕ anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies, indicating a genetic predisposition. Other symptoms include aphthous ulcers, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), calcium oxalate stones in urine, abdominal cramps, episcleritis, and a peak onset age of 20–40 years. Patients might also experience skin erythema, vomiting, growth delay, autoantibodies, iron deficiency, uveitis, macrocytic anemia, and manifestations of cigarette smoking. Furthermore, Crohn's disease can lead to iron deficiency anemia and flu-like symptoms, including nausea.

### Erythema multiforme: Recognition and management [^1166U3Du]. American Family Physician (2019). High credibility.

Regarding the screening and diagnosis of erythema multiforme, particularly in terms of diagnosis, the AAFP 2019 guidelines recommend suspecting erythema multiforme in patients with a target or iris lesion characterized by three concentric segments: a dark center, surrounded by a lighter pink ring, both enclosed by a red ring.

### Erythema multiforme: Recognition and management [^116TuGHB]. American Family Physician (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for erythema multiforme, and more specifically with respect to topical corticosteroids, the AAFP 2019 guidelines recommend offering topical corticosteroids for symptomatic management in patients with acute, uncomplicated erythema multiforme.

### Erythema multiforme [^115UAroo]. EClinicalMedicine (2024). High credibility.

Erythema multiforme is an inflammatory skin and mucosal disease primarily related to infectious agents, such as the herpes simplex virus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. However, it can also be "idiopathic". The characteristic skin lesions are typical or atypical acral raised target lesions. The oral mucosa can be affected alone or in combination with other mucosal or cutaneous sites, sometimes causing extreme pain, severely impacting food intake, and warranting hospitalization. A comprehensive understanding of erythema multiforme's clinical characteristics, triggering agents, and differential diagnosis, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis, is crucial to conducting proper workup and management.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection should be ruled out immediately due to the need for antibiotics. The cornerstone of management is symptomatic treatment, which will be detailed in this review, as well as the etiologic treatment. Lastly, the management of persistent or recurrent erythema multiforme can be challenging, especially when antivirals fail to prevent a relapse. However, breakthrough treatments have been reported as successful in this difficult-to-treat subset of patients.

### Erythema nodosum after COVID-19 vaccination in a pediatric patient [^1129b6D9]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Over the past year, vaccinations against SARS-CoV-2 have been authorized across the world to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. These vaccines have proven safe and effective, though side effects and adverse reactions do occur. Several dermatologic reactions following COVID-19 vaccination have been reported in adults. As vaccination eligibility is extended to the pediatric population, further characterization of the spectrum of cutaneous reactions in this population is needed. We describe a case of erythema nodosum following COVID-19 vaccination in a pediatric patient.

### Regranex [^1119tnwk]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

- **Adverse reactions**: Erythematous rashes occurred in 2% of patients treated with Regranex.

- **Clinical trials experience**: Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in practice. In clinical trials, erythematous rashes occurred in 2% of subjects treated with Regranex (and good ulcer care) or placebo (and good ulcer care), with none in subjects receiving good ulcer care alone. Subjects treated with Regranex did not develop neutralizing antibodies against becaplermin.

In a retrospective follow-up study of 491 out of 651 subjects (75%) from two randomized, controlled trials of another formulation of becaplermin gel 0.01%, subjects were followed for a median of approximately 20 months to evaluate safety and recurrence of healed diabetic lower extremity ulcers. Eight out of 291 subjects (2.7%) from the becaplermin gel group and two out of 200 subjects (1%) from the vehicle/standard of care group were diagnosed with cancers during the follow-up period, a relative risk of 2.7 (95% confidence interval, 0.6–12.8). The types of cancers varied and all were remote from the treatment site [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)].

### Primary cutaneous cryptococcal infection with subsequent erythema nodosum in a 10-year-old immunocompetent girl [^1119iBpz]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

The patient's erythema nodosum (EN) began to improve during her short hospital stay, where she received supportive care. She was discharged before receiving a diagnosis for her ulcer and was given a 2-week course of clindamycin. After leaving the hospital, the patient was lost to follow-up and was not seen in the clinic until six months after her hospitalization. At that point, her primary lesion and the EN had resolved without systemic antifungal treatment.

### Tuberculosis presenting as cutaneous erythema nodosum on 18F-FDG PET/CT [^115JdmA6]. Clinical Nuclear Medicine (2019). Low credibility.

A 47-year-old woman presented with areas of nodular swelling and discoloration on her bilateral lower limbs for 12 months. A biopsy of the skin lesions confirmed erythema nodosum. Since erythema nodosum can result from multiple etiologies, a whole-body F-FDG PET/CT was performed to evaluate the disease's distribution and determine the biopsy site. The F-FDG PET/CT scan revealed metabolically active mediastinal lymphadenopathy alongside the skin lesions. An endobronchial ultrasound-guided biopsy from the subcarinal lymph node identified tuberculosis.

### Blau syndrome (juvenile systemic granulomatosis): State-of-the-art review [^112Pu7cY]. Pediatric Dermatology (2025). Low credibility.

In addition to the typical granulomatous dermatitis, patients with Blau syndrome (BlauS) may exhibit other cutaneous findings. Skin nodules are a common occurrence. Although uncommon, some patients present with erythema nodosum-like lesions. Ichthyosis-like lesions, particularly ichthyosis vulgaris-like changes on the lower legs, are another feature that can also be observed in sarcoidosis. Over time, pigmentary changes may develop, with some patients presenting with hyperpigmented macules or patches that appear tan-colored or 'dirty'. One case reported associated lichenoid eruptions. In some instances, the granulomatous dermatitis can present in middle adulthood. Granulomatous dermatitis in BlauS may resolve spontaneously over time but can recur in intermittent episodes spanning years, sometimes requiring systemic treatment for control. Residual skin changes, like follicular atrophoderma or poikiloderma, can persist even after the active lesions fade.

### Erythema nodosum as a cutaneous manifestation of COVID-19 infection [^115jM6Np]. BMJ Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum (EN) is a common dermatological manifestation with many different aetiologies. Often, however, the aetiology remains unidentified. Here, we present a 42-year-old male patient with EN due to an acute COVID-19 infection. Most of the usual aetiologies were excluded by laboratory testing and imaging studies. To our knowledge, this case is the first report of this cutaneous manifestation in the context of a COVID-19 infection. The EN was successfully treated with the disappearance of the COVID-19 infection and the application of topical corticosteroids.

### Thalomid [^114Wdoew]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

The primary data demonstrating the efficacy of thalidomide in the treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) are derived from the published medical literature and from a retrospective study of 102 patients treated by the U.S. Public Health Service. Two double-blind, randomized, controlled trials reported the dermatologic response to a 7-day course of 100 mg thalidomide (four times daily) or control. The dosage was lower for patients under 50 kg in weight. Waters reported the results of two studies, both double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trials in a total of 10 hospitalized, steroid-dependent patients with chronic ENL treated with 100 mg thalidomide or placebo (three times daily). All patients also received dapsone. The primary endpoint was the reduction in weekly steroid dosage.

Data on the efficacy of thalidomide in the prevention of ENL relapse were derived from a retrospective evaluation of 102 patients treated under the auspices of the U.S. Public Health Service. A subset of patients with ENL controlled on thalidomide demonstrated repeated relapse upon drug withdrawal and remission with reinstitution of therapy.

Twenty U.S. patients between the ages of 11 and 17 years were treated with thalidomide, generally at 100 mg daily. Response rates and safety profiles were similar to those observed in the adult population. Thirty-two other published studies containing over 1600 patients consistently report generally successful treatment of the cutaneous manifestations of moderate to severe ENL with thalidomide.

### The cat did it: Erythema nodosum and additional atypical presentations of infection in immunocompetent hosts [^1161Lnko]. BMJ Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

A healthy patient presented with painful skin lesions on the anterior surface of her legs. Erythema nodosum was diagnosed, but all the usual causes were ruled out. The finding of bilateral enlarged axillary lymph nodes with necrosis and granulomas led to the diagnosis of Bartonella infection, an unusual cause of erythema nodosum. Imaging also revealed splenomegaly and small para-aortic lymph nodes. Up to one quarter of the patients with cat-scratch disease present atypically, a considerably higher prevalence than previously reported. A comprehensive review of the literature (PubMed, since inception, all languages) revealed a remarkable array of unusual presentations, which are summarized and briefly discussed.

### Dupixent [^112iaV82]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, serum sickness or serum sickness-like reactions, angioedema, generalized urticaria, rash, erythema nodosum, and erythema multiforme, have been reported. If a clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction occurs, institute appropriate therapy and discontinue Dupixent [see Adverse Reactions (6.1, 6.2) and Clinical Pharmacology (12.6)].

### Variation in the lymphotoxin-alpha/tumor necrosis factor locus modifies risk of erythema nodosum in sarcoidosis [^1148s13S]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2009). Low credibility.

Sarcoidosis is a multi-system inflammatory disease with organ involvement that varies by race and sex. Family studies indicate that genes play a role in the etiology and extent of organ involvement in sarcoidosis. In this study, we evaluated whether 25 variants distributed in 19 genes with a known role in inflammation were associated with erythema nodosum status in 659 sarcoidosis patients and 658 controls from A Case-Control Etiologic Study of Sarcoidosis (ACCESS).

We found no association with affectation status; however, a variant in the promoter of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) at position -308 was found to be associated with erythema nodosum in Caucasian sarcoidosis patients (study-wide P = 0.027). When separated by sex, a variant in intron 1 of lymphotoxin-alpha (LTA), a gene adjacent to TNF, was associated with erythema nodosum in female Caucasian sarcoidosis patients (study-wide P = 0.027). These DNA variants frequently occur together in Caucasians, and each variant has individually been associated with erythema nodosum in sarcoidosis patients.

These results confirm that variation in the LTA/TNF gene cluster modifies a major skin manifestation of sarcoidosis and may explain the higher rate of erythema nodosum in females with sarcoidosis.

Indications for everolimus and other drugs within the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor class have recently expanded to include tuberous sclerosis complex. Everolimus is generally well tolerated, but it is important for physicians to identify and manage associated cutaneous adverse effects. We report the first case of a child developing erythema nodosum while undergoing everolimus therapy.

### Magnetic resonance imaging appearance of erythema nodosum: A case report [^112M9ACx]. Journal of Radiology Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum (EN) is the most common inflammation of the subcutaneous fat tissue (panniculitis). EN requires an interdisciplinary approach and the exclusion of all underlying causes. We present a case of an 18-year-old female with a history of recurrent streptococcal infections over the years, who developed pain and swelling in the left ankle. To evaluate the persistent ankle swelling, the physician ordered a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left lower extremity. The MRI appearance of EN has not been described in detail in the literature so far.

### Erythema nodosum in northern Finland between 1996 and 2019: A register-based study [^113F5Fda]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum (EN) can occur at any age with varying and often unidentified etiology. We studied the etiology and characteristics of EN in Northern Finland. Medical records of all patients with a diagnosis code for EN between 1996 and 2019 from Oulu University Hospital were retrieved and analyzed. There were a total of 142 EN cases with a female predominance (n = 112, 72.9%). The mean age of the patients was 35.9 years. There were five cases diagnosed with EN in those younger than 2 years of age. Almost one-third had EN nodules in multiple anatomical locations. In addition to skin findings, systemic symptoms were common (81.0%) and more often seen in men (p < 0.05).

In children and adolescents, the most common etiological factors were gastroenteritis caused by 'Yersinia, Salmonella, or Campylobacter', followed by inflammatory bowel diseases and hormonal contraception. Bacterial infections were the most common etiological factor among adults. In 28.2% of the cases, there was no identified causative factor. In this study, EN was observed surprisingly often in small children. Etiological factors varied markedly among different age groups and symptoms differed between the sexes in adults. These aspects should be considered when diagnosing EN patients.

### Afinitordisperz [^114mibo8]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

Skin lesion response rates were assessed by local investigators for 77 patients in the AFINITOR arm and 37 patients in the placebo arm who presented with skin lesions at study entry. The skin lesion response rate was statistically significantly higher in the AFINITOR arm (26% vs. 0%, p = 0.0011); all skin lesion responses were partial responses, defined as visual improvement in 50% to 99% of all skin lesions durable for at least 8 weeks (Physician's Global Assessment of Clinical Condition).

Patients randomized to placebo were permitted to receive AFINITOR at the time of angiomyolipoma progression or after the time of the primary analysis. After the primary analysis, patients treated with AFINITOR underwent additional follow-up CT or MRI scans to assess tumor status until discontinuation of treatment or completion of 4 years of follow-up after the last patient was randomized. A total of 112 patients (79 randomized to AFINITOR and 33 randomized to placebo) received at least one dose of AFINITOR. The median duration of AFINITOR treatment was 3.9 years (0.5 months to 5.3 years), and the median duration of follow-up was 3.9 years (0.9 months to 5.4 years). During the follow-up period after the primary analysis, 32 patients (in addition to the 33 patients identified at the time of the primary analysis) had an angiomyolipoma response based upon independent central radiology review. Among the 65 responders out of 112 patients, the median time to angiomyolipoma response was 2.9 months (2.6 to 33.8 months). Fourteen percent of the 112 patients treated with AFINITOR had angiomyolipoma…

### Erythema nodosum-like rash in a COVID-19 patient: A case report [^115LUCqG]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2021). Low credibility.

Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral disease first described in Wuhan, China, which has quickly emerged as a global pandemic with a myriad of manifestations, including dermatologic [1,2]. A variety of cutaneous symptoms have presented throughout various stages of the disease [3–5,7,8]. We describe a case of a female patient who presented with an erythema nodosum-like exanthema likely secondary to COVID-19. The patient tested positive for COVID-19 three days prior to the presentation of the rash, with minimal other symptoms of COVID-19. Given the high infectivity rate and multisystem presentation, it is important to continue to report on novel presentations of the virus for early identification and treatment of complications.

### Differential diagnosis of round or discoid lesions [^111Z96DE]. Clinics in Dermatology (2011). Low credibility.

Dermatologists are frequently tasked with diagnosing a wide range of skin conditions across diverse age groups. A dermatologic diagnosis is typically based on identifying a primary lesion and uses morphologic clues to categorize the pathologic process causing the eruption. Additionally, the distribution and grouping of lesions provide substantial support for a specific diagnosis. Dermatologists, drawing from clinical experience, often utilize pattern recognition to formulate their differential diagnosis, having previously observed similarly appearing skin lesions in lectures, texts, and journals. Round and discoid patches and plaques are notably prevalent in the clinical practice of dermatology. This contribution examines the dermatologic conditions presenting as round or discoid lesions and outlines an approach to diagnosis.

### Annular lesions: Diagnosis and treatment [^112AmniE]. American Family Physician (2018). Low credibility.

Annular lesions can present in a variety of diseases. Knowledge of their physical appearance and history of presentation can significantly aid in diagnosis. A pruritic, annular, erythematous patch that grows centrifugally should prompt evaluation for tinea corporis. Tinea corporis may be diagnosed through potassium hydroxide examination of scrapings.

Recognizing erythema migrans is crucial for diagnosing Lyme disease, allowing for the prompt initiation of antibiotics. Plaque psoriasis generally presents with sharply demarcated, erythematous silver plaques. Erythema multiforme, a result of a hypersensitivity reaction, manifests as annular, raised lesions with central clearing. Lichen planus characteristically appears as planar, purple, polygonal, pruritic papules and plaques. Nummular eczema presents as a rash composed of coin-shaped papulovesicular erythematous lesions and treatment is aimed at reducing skin dryness.

Pityriasis rosea presents with multiple erythematous lesions with raised, scaly borders and is generally self-limited. Urticaria results from the release of histamines and appears as well-circumscribed, erythematous lesions with raised borders and blanched centers.

Annular lesions occur less commonly in individuals with fixed drug eruptions, leprosy, immunoglobulin A vasculitis, secondary syphilis, sarcoidosis, subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus, and granuloma annulare.

In conclusion, while erythema nodosum (EN) usually resolves with only symptomatic treatment, it is important to exclude the underlying causes. Our study highlights the most common etiologies in Northern Europe and the differences between different age groups. The leading symptoms, as well as their severity, can vary drastically, which may cause the patient to attend a number of different specialist clinics. Thus, awareness of features of EN is important among all physicians.

### Atypical erythema nodosum triggered by COVID-19 infection [^114HoXrY]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

With the emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2, we have learned a great deal about the potential cutaneous sequelae following infection. The variable dermatologic complications reported from viral infection thus far include pernio-type lesions, urticarial eruptions, vesicular eruptions, and more. Here, we report an atypical presentation of erythema nodosum (EN) following infection with SARS-CoV-2. To our knowledge, there have only been three other reports of EN secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection, also known as COVID-19.

### Erythema nodosum and erythema induratum (nodular vasculitis): Diagnosis and management [^1115ycX1]. Dermatologic Therapy (2010). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum is the most common type of panniculitis and may arise from a variety of underlying infectious or antigenic stimuli. The pathogenesis remains to be elucidated, but both neutrophilic and granulomatous inflammation are implicated. Beyond treating underlying triggers, therapeutic options primarily include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, symptomatic care, potassium iodide, and colchicine. Erythema induratum (nodular vasculitis) is a related but distinct clinicopathologic reaction pattern of subcutaneous fat. It is classically caused by an antigenic stimulus from Mycobacterium tuberculosis but may be associated with several other underlying disorders. After appropriate antimicrobial treatment in tuberculous cases, therapy for erythema induratum is similar to the options for erythema nodosum.

### The generalized rash: part I. Differential diagnosis [^112QSrxp]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Physicians often face difficulty diagnosing a generalized rash because many different conditions produce similar rashes, and a single condition can result in rashes with varied appearances. A rapid and accurate diagnosis is critically important for making treatment decisions, especially when mortality or significant morbidity can occur without prompt intervention. When a specific diagnosis is not immediately apparent, it is crucial to generate an inclusive differential diagnosis to guide the diagnostic strategy and initial treatment.

In part I of this two-part article, tables listing common, uncommon, and rare causes of generalized rash are presented to help generate an inclusive differential diagnosis. The tables describe the key clinical features and recommended tests to assist in accurately diagnosing generalized rashes. If the diagnosis remains unclear, the primary care physician must decide whether to observe and treat empirically, perform further diagnostic testing, or refer the patient to a dermatologist. This decision depends on the likelihood of a serious disorder and the patient's response to treatment.

### Outbreak of erythema nodosum of unknown cause - New Mexico, November 2007-January 2008 [^113LeJeG]. MMWR. Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (2009). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum (EN) is a form of panniculitis associated with various infectious and noninfectious etiologies. EN clusters have been linked to outbreaks of Coccidioides immitis, Histoplasma capsulatum, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis infections. In December 2007, a physician in a rural New Mexico community of approximately 10,000 persons reported to the New Mexico Department of Health (NMDOH) that 13 patients had been diagnosed with EN since mid-November.

No EN outbreak had ever been detected in this community, and since 2006, only one diagnosis of EN had been made at the local healthcare facility. NMDOH initiated an investigation to confirm the existence of the outbreak, determine the underlying etiology, and implement control measures. This report describes the results of that investigation.

Twenty-five EN cases were identified. Seventeen of 20 patients who answered a standard questionnaire reported being at a construction site with crowded and dusty conditions before EN onset. Nine of 15 chest radiographs were abnormal. Serologic test results were interpreted as negative for mycotic agents and inconclusive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. No etiology of the outbreak could be found.

During an EN outbreak, timely (acute and convalescent) specimen collection, ideally from case-patients and control subjects to determine baseline seropositivity, and sensitive tests (e.g. polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) are essential to differentiate among possible causes of EN.

### New cutaneous nodules associated with pulmonary symptoms [^113JntpR]. JAAD Case Reports (2019). Low credibility.

Which of the following cutaneous manifestations of this disease would likely produce evidence of fungal dissemination on biopsy?

- **Erythema nodosum**: Incorrect. Cutaneous manifestations of Coccidioidomycosis are categorized as reactive or organism-specific. Erythema nodosum is considered the most frequent reactive manifestation.

- **Erythema multiforme**: Incorrect. Erythema multiforme is characterized by target-like lesions and can include oral findings. It is also considered a reactive cutaneous finding and, as such, would not produce visible microorganisms on biopsy.

- **Sweet syndrome**: Incorrect. Sweet syndrome is a very rare feature of Coccidioidomycosis. Biopsy would show abundant neutrophils but not microorganisms.

- **Acute generalized exanthema**: Incorrect. Acute generalized exanthema, which can be mistaken for allergic contact dermatitis, would not produce evidence of fungal dissemination on biopsy.

- **Solitary granulomatous plaques**: Correct. Clinically, lesions as a result of dissemination are nonspecific and include ulcerated and verrucous plaques; solitary granulomatous plaques; and papular, nodular, or pustular lesions. The clinical differential diagnosis includes histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, Cryptococcus, and sarcoidosis.

### The generalized rash: part II. Diagnostic approach [^113F39rh]. American Family Physician (2010). Low credibility.

Although it is important to begin the evaluation of a generalized rash with an inclusive differential diagnosis, the possibilities must be narrowed down by taking a focused history and looking for key clinical features of the rash. Part I of this two-part article lists the common, uncommon, and rare causes of generalized rashes. In part II, the clinical features that help distinguish these rashes are described.

These features include key elements of the history such as travel, environmental exposures, and personal or family history of atopy. Additionally, characteristics of individual lesions — such as color, size, shape, and scale — as well as the areas of involvement and sparing are crucial, with particular attention to the palms, soles, face, nails, sun-exposed areas, and both extensor and flexor surfaces of extremities. Furthermore, it is important to ascertain whether the lesions are pruritic or painful and to note any systemic symptoms, especially fever. Dermatologic signs, such as blanching and the Koebner phenomenon, are also significant factors to consider.

### Papules developing in an old tattoo [^112yd6Qh]. JAAD Case Reports (2018). Low credibility.

Two months later, this patient suddenly developed a low-grade fever and 2- to 4-cm tender, erythematous swollen areas on the shins. There was no scarring or atrophy.

Question 3: What is the most likely diagnosis?

A. Erythema nodosum
B. Necrobiosis lipoidica
C. Nodular vasculitis
D. Pretibial myxedema
E. Factitial disease

- **Answers**:
	- A. Erythema nodosum – Correct. Of the nonspecific manifestations of sarcoidosis, erythema nodosum is the most common. It is a hypersensitivity reaction in fat septae, but the pathophysiologic basis of this condition in sarcoidosis is unknown. It manifests as tender, erythematous subcutaneous nodules, most often on the anterior tibia. It can be accompanied by fever, malaise, and polyarthralgia.
	- B. Necrobiosis lipoidica – Incorrect. This condition is associated with diabetes mellitus and presents with atrophy, which was not seen in this patient.
	- C. Nodular vasculitis – Incorrect. Nodular vasculitis involves medium-sized arteries in the reticular dermis and can appear much like the nodular swellings of erythema nodosum. It is not associated with sarcoidosis.
	- D. Pretibial myxedema – Incorrect. Pretibial myxedema is the result of the accumulation of glycosaminoglycans in the dermis. It is most commonly associated with Graves disease. It is typically asymptomatic and is characterized by swelling and induration of the lower legs. It is not associated with sarcoidosis.
	- E. Factitial disease – Incorrect. This would be a consideration if the nodules in the tattoo were thought to be of factitial origin. Histopathology for factitial disease would be nonspecific.

### A photodistributed rash in a patient on apixaban [^112r2bNM]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

A 63-year-old female with a recent diagnosis of atrial fibrillation presented with a 1-month history of a pruritic rash. Apixaban was started 6 weeks prior to presentation after cardiac ablation. She was using triamcinolone ointment without improvement. Examination showed photodistributed erythematous coalescing scaly papules on the vertex scalp, shoulders, and upper arms, with sharp demarcation along the shirt line (Fig 1). Shave biopsy demonstrated interface dermatitis, dermal mucin, and superficial dermal perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate (Figs 2 and 3). Lab testing was notable for anti-histone antibody 3.7U (strong positive), elevated liver enzymes, normal complete blood count, and negative anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti-SSA, and SSB antibodies.

- **Question 1**: What is the most likely diagnosis for the patient's skin condition?
	- A. Psoriasis
	- B. Discoid lupus erythematosus
	- C. Dermatomyositis
	- D. Jessner's lymphocytic infiltrate of the skin
	- E. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE)

- **Answers**:
	- A. Psoriasis – Incorrect. Psoriasis typically presents with well-defined erythematous plaques covered with silvery scales, commonly involving extensor surfaces like elbows and knees. It typically exhibits parakeratosis, acanthosis, and Munro microabscesses.
	- B. Discoid lupus erythematosus – Incorrect. Discoid lupus erythematosus presents with discoid lesions, often with adherent scales, and can cause scarring. It typically lacks the widespread photodistribution and histology findings including superficial and deep perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate.
	- C. Dermatomyositis – Incorrect.

### Atypical erythema nodosum in atypical tuberculosis presentation [^114aqLcj]. BMJ Case Reports (2009). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum (EN) is an inflammatory disease of the skin and subcutaneous tissue that may be associated with various systemic diseases such as infectious diseases, sarcoidosis, Behçet disease, inflammatory bowel diseases, and tumors, particularly lymphoma. EN may also be induced by certain drugs, including primarily estroprogestinics, salicylic acid, minocycline, and sulfamidic acid. Due to the numerous potential causes, it can be challenging to achieve a correct diagnostic interpretation, especially when an isolated EN is the revealing feature, as in the following case. We describe the case of a young patient in good clinical condition who developed EN during the course of abdominal tuberculosis. The diagnosis was confirmed by histologic examination of the abdominal formation, as positron emission tomography and total body axial tomography were not useful in differentiating EN from malignancies.

### Erythema multiforme: a review of epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and treatment [^115rcjbq]. Dental Clinics of North America (2013). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on erythema multiforme:

- **Definition**: Erythema multiforme is an immune-mediated disorder characterized by the presence of distinctive target lesions on the skin (primarily in acral regions) and/or mucous membranes.

- **Pathophysiology**: The exact pathophysiology of erythema multiforme is not fully understood, but it is believed to be an immune reaction triggered by various factors. Infections, particularly HSV, are the most common triggers. Other viruses, such as HCV, Coxsackievirus, and EBV, as well as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, certain medications, and vaccines have also been implicated.

- **Epidemiology**: The incidence of erythema multiforme is believed to be 0.01–1% annually, most commonly affecting individuals aged 18–30 years.

- **Risk factors**: Risk factors for erythema multiforme include infections, especially HSV, and exposure to certain medications. However, in many cases, no specific trigger or risk factor can be identified.

- **Disease course**: Clinically, erythema multiforme presents with symmetrically distributed target lesions on the extremities and trunk. These lesions are characterized by concentric zones of color change. The severity of erythema multiforme can vary widely, from mild forms with only skin involvement to severe forms that affect multiple mucous membranes and can be life-threatening.

- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The prognosis for erythema multiforme is generally favorable. Most cases are self-limiting and resolve within weeks to months without long-term complications.

### Erythema multiforme: A review of epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and treatment [^115cxLn4]. Dental Clinics of North America (2013). High credibility.

Erythema multiforme is a disease that can be associated with various symptoms and conditions. These include mucosal erosions, skin macules, target lesions, and mucosal bullae. Patients may experience cough, pruritus, oral mucosal erythema, myalgia, and malaise. Additionally, it can present with Koebner phenomenon, red eyes, and herpetic viral (HSV) infection. Atypical target lesions, lip swelling, fever, and a burning sensation are also noted.

The involvement of HIV infection, skin papules, photophobia, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are documented. Symptoms such as eye pain, conjunctival injection, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (↑ ESR), and elevated urine white blood cells (↑ urine WBCs) can occur. Painful oral lesions, nailfold swelling, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, and mycoplasma pneumoniae infection are additional manifestations associated with erythema multiforme.

### Coalescing plaques on the face, trunk, and upper extremities [^1167gEH2]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

A 38-year-old woman from Southern Arizona with no significant past medical history presented with a 6-day history of a painful, pruritic rash. Examination showed pink, coalescing, annular plaques with central scale scattered across the face, upper extremities, back (Fig 1), and chest (Fig 2). She reported fatigue and migratory arthralgias but denied fevers, respiratory symptoms, new medications, pregnancy, or recent travel. Biopsy demonstrated papillary dermal edema with a dermal neutrophilic interstitial infiltrate, scattered eosinophils, and an associated perivascular lymphoid infiltrate (Fig 3). Autoimmune serology was negative for antinuclear and anti-Ro antibodies. Complete blood count with differential demonstrated neutrophilia, and the rash rapidly improved with topical 0.1% triamcinolone administration.

### A retrospective clinicopathological study of erythema nodosum [^115JHd9e]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum (EN) may be idiopathic or secondary, and usually resolves naturally within 1 to 2 months. In atypical EN cases, the rash extends beyond the lower limbs to the upper limbs and trunk, and histopathological findings may be accompanied by vasculitis in addition to septal panniculitis. Few studies have examined the differences in the clinical characteristics of patients with EN based on rash distribution. We retrospectively examined whether there was a correlation with clinical information, such as the presence or absence of underlying diseases, by classifying the patients into two groups: the lower limbs group (the EN rash was confined to the lower limbs) and the beyond lower limbs group (the EN rash appeared beyond the lower limbs).

Among the 86 adult patients diagnosed with EN at the Dermatology Department of Fujita Medical University between 2015 and 2020, there were 65 cases in the lower limbs group and 21 cases in the beyond lower limbs group. The frequency of underlying diseases was significantly higher in the beyond lower limbs group (76.2%, 16 cases) than in the lower limbs group (40.0%, 26 cases; P < 0.005). Vasculitis was more notable in the beyond lower limbs group (P < 0.05). Significantly higher vasculitis was noted in the EN group with underlying diseases (30.2%, 13 cases) than in the idiopathic EN group without underlying diseases (11.6%, 5 cases; P < 0.05). Neutrophil extracellular traps were positive in approximately 40% of cases in both groups.

In the beyond lower limbs group, the possibility of severe cases with underlying diseases and vasculitis, and inf

### Immunodeficiency due to a novel variant in PIK3CD: A case report [^114swSUt]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2023). High credibility.

A 27-month-old girl was referred to the rheumatology clinic of Mofid Children's Hospital (Tehran, Iran) due to fever, arthritis, and erythema nodosum. She was the second living child of a consanguineous marriage (G2P2L2) with a birth weight of 3800 grams and a history of neurodevelopmental delays in walking (at the age of 21 months) and speaking (at the age of 24 months). The family history was unremarkable, except for the mother, who had hypothyroidism and a history of frequent respiratory infections during childhood.

The patient had been hospitalized several times after birth. Her first admission occurred at two months old with a fever and elevated levels of ESR and CRP. She was treated with antibiotics for five days and discharged without any signs or symptoms, although elevated ESR and CRP levels persisted.

At eight months old, she was evaluated for failure to thrive (FTT). Examination revealed a low heart rate, muffled heart sound, and massive pericardial effusion in her echocardiography. This condition led to her hospitalization for 16 days in the intensive care unit (ICU). The pericardial effusion was tapped without finding any infectious sources and treated with prednisolone, after which she was discharged in good condition. Two months later, she was readmitted with recurrent pericardial effusion for 19 days. During evaluations, she was diagnosed with hypothyroidism and mild pericardial effusion. Treatment included dexamethasone, ibuprofen, and levothyroxine.

Fourth and fifth hospitalizations occurred due to high-grade fever and…

### Mucosal ulcers, extremity nodules, and fevers [^115FTjLU]. JAAD Case Reports (2025). Low credibility.

- **Question 1**: What is the most likely diagnosis?
	- A. Sweet syndrome
	- B. Behçet's disease
	- C. Primary EBV infection
	- D. Erythema multiforme
	- E. Primary Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) infection

- **Answers**:
	- A. Sweet syndrome – Incorrect. Sweet syndrome presents with neutrophilia, fevers, and typically edematous plaques or vesiculobullous lesions. Histology would show a dense neutrophilic infiltrate and papillary dermal edema without evidence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis.
	- B. Behçet's disease – Correct. The oral and genital ulcers, neutrophilic vasculitis on histology of erythema nodosum-like skin lesions, as well as ocular, neurologic, gastrointestinal, and joint symptoms, with an otherwise unremarkable infectious and inflammatory workup, led to a diagnosis of Behçet's disease.
	- C. Primary EBV infection – Incorrect. EBV infection may have been both an inciting trigger for Behçet's disease and the cause of her initial presentation consistent with infectious mononucleosis. Associations between EBV infection and Behçet's disease have been well demonstrated. While EBV itself can have dermatologic manifestations, EBV alone was improbable, particularly given evidence of neutrophilic vasculitis on biopsy, and subsequent EBV viral load and IgM testing were negative.
	- D. Erythema multiforme – Incorrect. The rash associated with erythema multiforme typically consists of targetoid plaques on the distal extremities. Skin biopsy findings here are also not compatible with erythema multiforme, which would show a vacuolar interface dermatitis with a lymphocytic infiltrate, rather than a neutrophilic vasculitis.

### Erythema nodosum in northern Finland between 1996 and 2019: A register-based study [^113Vjjj8]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). High credibility.

Erythema nodosum (EN) is observed at any age with varying and often unidentified etiology. We studied the etiology and characteristics of EN in Northern Finland, analyzing medical records of all patients with a diagnosis code for EN between 1996 and 2019 from Oulu University Hospital. There were a total of 142 EN cases with a female predominance (n = 112, 72.9%). The mean age of the patients was 35.9 years. Five cases were diagnosed with EN in children younger than 2 years of age. Almost one third had EN nodules in multiple anatomical locations.

In addition to skin findings, systemic symptoms were common (81.0%) and seen more often in men (p < 0.05). In children and adolescents, the most common etiological factors were gastroenteritis caused by 'Yersinia, Salmonella or Campylobacter', followed by inflammatory bowel diseases and hormonal contraception. Bacterial infections were the most common etiological factor among adults. In 28.2% of the cases, there was no identified causative factor. In this study, EN was observed surprisingly often in small children. Etiological factors varied markedly among different age groups, and symptoms differed between the sexes in adults. These aspects should be considered when diagnosing EN patients.

### Erythema nodosum induced by kerion celsi of the scalp [^115QXpk5]. Pediatric Dermatology (2001). Low credibility.

A 5-year-old girl presented with a 2-week history of a sharply demarcated, inflammatory, granulomatous lesion on the right side of her scalp. Shortly afterward, painful, subcutaneous nodules developed on her shins and thighs. Trichophyton mentagrophytes was isolated from the scalp lesion, and a diagnosis of erythema nodosum induced by kerion of the scalp was made. The patient was started on oral therapy with 18 mg/kg/day of griseofulvin, associated with topical crystal violet. Her erythema nodosum regressed in 10 days, while the kerion healed 6 weeks later, leaving residual scarring alopecia. Erythema nodosum represents a reaction pattern to a wide variety of inflammatory stimuli. The interest of this case lies in the unusual association of kerion erythema nodosum, of which only nine cases have been reported in the international literature.

### Use of etanercept in management of tyrosine kinase-inhibitor-induced erythema nodosum [^114Qrgge]. JAAD Case Reports (2020). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum (EN) can occur in patients receiving tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI), and it typically resolves with cessation of the offending drug. In some cases, it is possible to continue the medication while suppressing EN with systemic corticosteroids. Here, we present an instance of TKI-induced EN in a patient with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) that was refractory to both oral and intralesional corticosteroids. However, successful treatment was achieved using etanercept, allowing for the resumption of targeted chemotherapy.

### Finacea [^115oDAWS]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2025). High credibility.

The primary efficacy endpoints included both:

1. Change from baseline in inflammatory lesion counts.
2. Success defined as a score of "clear" or "minimal" with at least a 2-step reduction from baseline on the Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA). These scores are defined as follows:

- **Clear**: No papules and/or pustules; no or residual erythema; no or mild to moderate telangiectasia.

- **Minimal**: Rare papules and/or pustules; residual to mild erythema; mild to moderate telangiectasia.

- **Mild**: Few papules and/or pustules; mild erythema; mild to moderate telangiectasia.

- **Mild to moderate**: Distinct number of papules and/or pustules; mild to moderate erythema; mild to moderate telangiectasia.

- **Moderate**: Pronounced number of papules and/or pustules; moderate erythema; mild to moderate telangiectasia.

- **Moderate to severe**: Many papules and/or pustules, occasionally with large inflamed lesions; moderate erythema; moderate degree of telangiectasia.

- **Severe**: Numerous papules and/or pustules, occasionally with confluent areas of inflamed lesions; moderate or severe erythema; moderate or severe telangiectasia.

Primary efficacy assessment was based on the "intent-to-treat" (ITT) population with the "last observation carried forward" (LOCF) method.

Both trials demonstrated a statistically significant difference in favor of FINACEA Gel over its vehicle in reducing the number of inflammatory papules and pustules associated with rosacea, and in demonstrating success on the IGA in the ITT-LOCF population at the end of treatment.

### Proceedings of the 31st European Paediatric Rheumatology Congress: part 1 [^112tn8kU]. Pediatric Rheumatology Online Journal (2024). Low credibility.

A previously healthy 5-year-old girl presented to the emergency department with a 1-week history of a rash. The rash began on the shins and feet, gradually spreading to the back. The elements were of petechiae and purpuric type, palpable, and non-itchy. There was no associated abdominal pain, fever, chills, or joint pain or swelling. Notably, the medical history included an asymptomatic COVID-19 infection approximately 4 weeks prior to the rash onset, detected during contact screening.

During physical examination, her growth and development parameters were normal, with vital signs within the normal range. Observations included round, dark, palpable purpuric elements and petechiae on the soles, feet, and shins. Laboratory workups such as a complete blood count, liver function tests, and kidney function were within normal limits. Assessment of inflammatory markers revealed normal C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and ferritin levels, but a slightly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Additionally, C3 levels were normal, ANA was negative, and D-dimer was elevated. ECG results were normal. Urinalysis showed moderate erythrocyturia without proteinuria.

The patient was prescribed a course of oral prednisolone and spent two days in the hospital. A skin biopsy was not performed.

### Concurrent Sweet's syndrome and erythema nodosum [^116dTwgp]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

A 29-year-old Mexican man was admitted to the hospital with fever, cough, sore throat, and red, tender leg nodules suggestive of erythema nodosum (Fig. 1). The white blood cell count was 35,000. Several days later, annular plaques and pustules developed on his face, neck, and forearms (Figs. 2 and 3). A facial skin biopsy showed neutrophilic dermatitis without evidence of infection or vasculitis, consistent with Sweet's syndrome. A biopsy of the thigh was non-diagnostic, but showed a mixed neutrophilic and granulomatous dermatitis.

- **Figure 1**: The patient's legs show red, tender nodules suggestive of erythema nodosum.

- **Figure 2**: Annular plaques and pustules developed on the patient's face.

- **Figure 3**: Annular plaques developed on the patient's hands.

Erythema nodosum (EN) is a form of panniculitis characterized by painful red nodules over the pretibial area. Sweet's syndrome (SS) is an acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by fever, leukocytosis, and erythematous plaques involving the arms, trunk, and neck. Vesiculopustules, nodules, and ulcers may also occur. The simultaneous occurrence of EN and SS has been increasingly reported, and both appear to be reactive dermatoses with overlapping clinical and histopathologic features.

Although often idiopathic, both disorders have been associated with upper respiratory infections, medications, hematologic malignancies, and autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Treatment includes corticosteroids, potassium iodide, or colchicine. SS generally responds well to therapy but recurs in up to…

### Erythematous patches and nodules in a neutropenic patient [^114z8njP]. JAAD Case Reports (2024). Low credibility.

- **Question 3**: Which of the following treatments is initially preferred?
	- A. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
	- B. Corticosteroids
	- C. Dapsone
	- D. Colchicine
	- E. Adalimumab

- **Answers**:
	- A. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs – Correct. NEH is generally a self-limiting condition that does not require therapy, with most cases resolving within a month of chemotherapy cessation. However, supportive care, including symptomatic management of fever and pain with NSAIDs, is recommended.
	- B. Corticosteroids – Incorrect. Corticosteroids, both systemic and topical, have been shown to shorten the duration of lesions and relieve pain in patients with refractory disease. However, the need for systemic steroids in NEH is debatable, and high-dose systemic steroids should be used with caution in neutropenic patients.
	- C. Dapsone – Incorrect. Case reports have shown that dapsone, which decreases neutrophil migration, can be beneficial in treating NEH, but this is generally reserved for recalcitrant disease.
	- D. Colchicine – Incorrect. Colchicine decreases neutrophil chemotaxis, adhesion, and degranulation and has successfully treated neutrophilic dermatoses including Behcet disease and Sweet syndrome. Colchicine has been efficacious in some cases of NEH but is not a first-line therapy.
	- E. Adalimumab – Incorrect. Adalimumab is a TNF-alpha inhibitor that is often utilized for the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa, pyoderma gangrenosum, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis. It is not an appropriate therapy for NEH.

### Dupilumab-induced erythema nodosum [^112avsY7]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that functions as an interleukin (IL) 4α receptor antagonist, inhibiting the activity of both IL-4 and IL-13, which are drivers of T helper 2 mediated inflammation. Although injection-site reactions are the most reported side effect, there have been several reported cases of adverse dermatologic reactions, including facial and neck erythema. We present a case of a patient with severe eosinophilic asthma and chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps in whom drug-induced erythema nodosum (EN) developed after 8 weeks of dupilumab therapy.

### Red face revisited: Flushing [^11478a32]. Clinics in Dermatology (2014). Low credibility.

The term "red face" is reserved for lesions located exclusively or predominantly on the face, resulting from changes in cutaneous blood flow triggered by various conditions. Facial erythema may present clinically as a distinct entity or as a sign of other diseases. Patients with a red face challenge clinicians to consider a broad differential diagnosis. Diagnosis is based on the date and mode of appearance, characteristics of the erythema, functional signs, and associated systemic manifestations.

In most cases, the cause is a benign disease such as rosacea, contact dermatitis, photodermatosis, or climacterium. A thorough history and physical examination are typically enough to make a diagnosis; however, facial erythema may also be a symptom of drug allergies, cardiac disease, carcinoid syndrome, pheochromocytoma, mastocytosis, and anaphylaxis. Some rare causes include medullary carcinoma of the thyroid, pancreatic cell tumors, and renal carcinoma, where further laboratory, radiologic, or histopathologic studies are required.

In this review, the mechanisms of flushing, its clinical differential diagnosis, and the management of various conditions causing flushing are discussed.

### The rash that presents as target lesions [^113JbXQJ]. Clinics in Dermatology (2018). Low credibility.

We have explored the rash that appears as target lesions, with the central and dominant diseases belonging to the Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis group. After presenting the clinical patterns of an individual target lesion and classifying them into different types of lesions, the contribution has been organized with groups characterized by such specific findings according to the type of lesion: flat or raised, typical or atypical, presence or absence of fever, presence or absence of mucosal ulcerations, presence or absence of arthralgias, and/or internal organ involvement. Other specific features, such as histologic appearance, immunofluorescence findings, and laboratory changes, are considered. We provide clinicians with an algorithmic, systematic, and logical approach to diagnose the condition of patients who present with targetoid lesions, enabling them to differentiate between those with serious systemic and life-threatening diseases from others with ordinary skin ailments.

### Polyarthritis, neuropathy, and persistent violaceous plaques [^115vym54]. JAAD Case Reports (2021). Low credibility.

- **Question 1**: What is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Cutaneous tuberculosis
B. Drug reaction
C. Erythema nodosum leprosum
D. Sweet syndrome
E. Tumid lupus erythematosus

- **Answer**: A. Cutaneous tuberculosis – Incorrect. There is a clinical and histologic overlap of erythema nodosum leprosum with certain presentations of cutaneous tuberculosis (such as lupus vulgaris) and other infectious granulomatous diseases. However, the neural tropism of the acid-fast organisms — a highly characteristic feature of leprosy — and the prominent vasculitis make cutaneous tuberculosis less likely.

B. Drug-induced erythema nodosum – Incorrect. Drug reaction is a diagnosis of exclusion. Although hypersensitivity reactions to certain drugs can present with a clinical picture of erythema nodosum, the histopathologic features and the findings of organisms by Fite staining exclude a drug reaction.

C. Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) – Correct. Histopathology shows a superficial and deep perivascular, prominent perineural, and interstitial infiltrate of lymphocytes, foamy histiocytes, and plasma cells (Fig 1, B). Perivascular neutrophils, nuclear dust, and fibrin deposition are also present (Fig 1, C). Fite stain shows numerous acid-fast bacilli within histiocytes, within a nerve, and in endothelial cells (Fig 1, D). The diagnosis rendered was multibacillary leprosy with associated vasculitis, consistent with ENL. Subsequent polymerase chain reaction on the specimen was positive for Mycobacterium leprae.

D. Sweet syndrome – Incorrect. Sweet syndrome presents with tender, edematous, erythematous papules and nodules.

### Erythema multiforme: Recognition and management [^113RjPSJ]. American Family Physician (2019). Low credibility.

Erythema multiforme is an immune-mediated reaction that involves the skin and sometimes the mucosa. Classically described as target-like, the erythema multiforme lesions can be isolated, recurrent, or persistent. Most commonly, the lesions of erythema multiforme present symmetrically on the extremities (especially on extensor surfaces) and spread centripetally. Infections, especially herpes simplex virus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and medications constitute most of the causes of erythema multiforme; immunizations and autoimmune diseases have also been linked to erythema multiforme. Erythema multiforme can be differentiated from urticaria by the duration of individual lesions. Erythema multiforme lesions are typically fixed for a minimum of seven days, whereas individual urticarial lesions often resolve within one day. Erythema multiforme can be confused with the more serious condition, Stevens-Johnson syndrome; however, Stevens-Johnson syndrome usually contains widespread erythematous or purpuric macules with blisters.

The management of erythema multiforme involves symptomatic treatment with topical steroids or antihistamines and treating the underlying etiology, if known. Erythema multiforme associated with the herpes simplex virus should be treated with prophylactic antiviral therapy. Severe mucosal erythema multiforme can require hospitalization for intravenous fluids and repletion of electrolytes.

### Diffuse granulomatous disease: Looking inside and outside the lungs [^1132tqjM]. Thorax (2020). Low credibility.

A prereferral chest radiograph revealed widening of the superior mediastinum and ill-defined nodular opacities in the middle and lower zones. Despite the history of possible erythema nodosum and raised serum ACE, the account of re-infections suggested a differential diagnosis broader than typical sarcoidosis. Demonstration of ventilatory restriction and impaired gas transfer factor hinted towards an interstitial or diffuse lung pathology. The Kco, at nearly twice the TLco in %-predicted terms, indicated a low likelihood of major pulmonary vasculopathy, and the absence of airflow limitation or small airway dysfunction steered the diagnosis away from primary bronchiolar disorders. CT with contiguous image acquisition was undertaken.

### Transient leg nodules [^113aYyJP]. JAAD Case Reports (2022). Low credibility.

A 14-year-old male presented to a pediatric dermatology clinic with painful skin-colored leg nodules (Fig 1). For the past 7 months, these nodules would transiently appear and disappear on his left lower leg while walking long distances or uphill. In the clinic, standing or bearing weight on the leg elicited the appearance of the nodules, while plantar flexion of the foot and cessation of weight bearing caused the nodules to disappear (Video 1). The patient had previously consulted other medical providers and underwent static leg ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies, which revealed no abnormalities.

- **Question 1: What is the most likely diagnosis?**
	- A. Lipoma
	- B. Vascular malformation
	- C. Epidermal inclusion cyst
	- D. Dermatofibroma
	- E. Tibialis anterior muscle herniation

- **Answer**:
	- A. Lipoma — Incorrect. Lipomas are slow-growing benign fat tissue tumors that can present as flesh-colored nodules. They would not disappear upon movement and are not typically painful.
	- B. Vascular malformation — Incorrect. Vascular malformations are due to the abnormal development of capillaries, veins, arteries, or lymphatics and, while not always noticed at birth, typically present in the first decade of life and would be visualized by ultrasound or MRI.
	- C. Epidermal inclusion cyst — Incorrect. Epidermal inclusion cysts present as subcutaneous nodules that may fluctuate in size over time. Movement, however, would not cause them to transiently appear and disappear.
	- D. Dermatofibroma — Incorrect. Dermatofibromas are common fibrous nodules that dimple upon pinching of surrounding skin.

The most likely diagnosis, given the transient nature of the nodules and their appearance related to movement, is tibialis anterior muscle herniation.

### Primary tuberculosis cases presenting with erythema nodosum [^1119rQXk]. The Journal of Dermatology (2004). Low credibility.

Erythema nodosum (EN) is seen only in the primary tuberculosis (TB) form of tuberculous diseases. Among the etiologies of EN, TB is the most frequent disorder in developing countries. We aimed to assess our patients with EN in reference to primary TB. We evaluated 335 patients with the diagnosis of TB during the last 20 years; retrospectively, 61 (18%) of these cases had pulmonary TB, and 274 (82%) had extrapulmonary TB. Ten (16%) of the pulmonary TB cases were primary. All 10 patients with primary TB presented with EN. Among 50 patients with EN diagnosed and followed during the last 10 years, the etiology was determined in 56%, and primary TB was the most frequent: 20%.

### Erythema nodosum in northern Finland between 1996 and 2019: A register-based study [^112PiVyi]. The Journal of Dermatology (2024). Low credibility.

Panniculitis is a condition where the subcutaneous fat tissue becomes inflamed. The most common clinical form of panniculitis is erythema nodosum (EN), characterized by painful, red, rounded nodules traditionally localized on the anterior surface of the limbs. The most common localization is the shins, although other localizations are possible. The etiology of EN is still unknown, with around half of the cases considered idiopathic. The known causes for EN include infections, sarcoidosis, pregnancy, inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), drugs (such as contraceptive pills), and neoplastic diseases. The annual incidence of EN is estimated to be around 15 per 100,000 persons, varying depending on the incidence rate of the causal conditions between populations. EN is more common among females, appearing up to five times more often in women than in men. EN is most often diagnosed in patients from their teens to their 30s, but it can be seen at any age. The objective of this study was to analyze the characteristics and etiology associated with EN in patients in the Oulu University Hospital (OUH) in Northern Finland.
