## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking for a step-by-step differential diagnosis and workup of hypercalcemia. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming true hypercalcemia and classifying severity. Then, I should order the pivotal test of intact PTH to split the differential into PTH-dependent versus PTH-independent etiologies. Next, I will review PTH-dependent causes, especially primary hyperparathyroidism and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, including mimics like thiazides and lithium. After that, I will examine PTH-independent causes such as malignancy, vitamin D–mediated granulomatous disease, and medication-related entities like milk-alkali syndrome. Then, I should consider endocrine and other less common causes. Finally, I will integrate a pragmatic testing algorithm and close with key distinctions and special scenarios, including pregnancy, pediatrics, and when to involve genetics or imaging, making sure I verify each assertion against guidelines and key reviews as I go.

> Let me first confirm the biochemical abnormality and its severity before labeling a diagnosis; I need to check for true hypercalcemia by correcting total calcium for albumin or, better yet, measuring ionized calcium, and then grade severity because management urgency scales with severity and rapidity of onset, noting that severe hypercalcemia generally means total calcium ≥ 14 mg/dL or ionized calcium ≥ 2.5 mmol/L, and that symptoms tend to escalate as calcium rises or acutely worsens [^117NS27X] [^116iNEwN].

> Next, I should review the single most important initial test: intact parathyroid hormone using a second- or third-generation assay, ideally repeated if the result is equivocal; I need to ensure the PTH is interpreted in the context of concurrent calcium because an elevated or inappropriately normal PTH in the face of hypercalcemia supports PTH-dependent causes, whereas a suppressed PTH points toward PTH-independent mechanisms, and I should remember that normocalcemic PHPT is a recognized entity that requires normal adjusted and ionized calcium with elevated PTH on at least two occasions after excluding secondary causes, so I must not jump to conclusions from a single assay [^117NS27X] [^115mxSJ5] [^114KmBRe].

> If PTH is elevated or inappropriately normal, I will now examine primary hyperparathyroidism as the leading diagnosis; I should confirm the biochemical diagnosis with repeat fasting calcium and PTH on a separate day, consider serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D to exclude secondary hyperparathyroidism, and plan localization imaging only after the biochemical diagnosis is secured, typically with sestamibi and neck ultrasound when surgery is contemplated, while remembering that PHPT accounts for the majority of ambulatory hypercalcemia and often requires no urgent therapy unless severe or symptomatic [^115mxSJ5] [^111cwjeB] [^117NS27X].

> Wait, let me verify the critical mimic: familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, which can masquerade as PHPT; I should calculate the 24-hour urine calcium or, more practically, the calcium-to-creatinine clearance ratio, where a CCCR less than 0.01 strongly favors FHH, 0.01–0.02 is indeterminate, and greater than 0.02 favors PHPT, keeping in mind overlap and confounders like vitamin D deficiency or renal insufficiency; when the biochemical picture is equivocal, I need to consider genetic testing for CASR, GNA11, and AP2S1 mutations to secure the diagnosis and avoid unnecessary parathyroid surgery, especially in younger patients or those with a family history of hypercalcemia [^114DBWVe] [^115DeQBZ] [^11359pDe] [^1158XTfV].

> Hold on, I should verify medication-induced mimics before labeling PHPT; thiazide diuretics and lithium can elevate serum calcium and PTH, so I need to check the medication list carefully and, when feasible, repeat testing off these agents, recognizing that lithium shifts the CaSR set point and can create a biochemical phenotype that resembles PHPT, and that stopping thiazides for a couple of weeks can help clarify the picture before making surgical decisions [^114DBWVe] [^111NHvJM].

> But wait, what if PTH is suppressed; in that case, I should pivot to PTH-independent causes, starting with malignancy as the most common non-PTH etiology in hospitalized patients; I will now examine PTHrP as the principal mediator in squamous carcinomas and other epithelial tumors, and consider local osteolytic bone destruction from metastases or multiple myeloma, as well as calcitriol-mediated hypercalcemia in lymphomas, because these mechanisms require different ancillary tests and carry distinct prognostic implications [^117NS27X] [^116XRC2f] [^111wsekJ].

> Let me consider vitamin D–mediated hypercalcemia next; I should double-check serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, because elevated 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D with suppressed PTH and low or normal 25-hydroxyvitamin D points to granulomatous disease or other macrophage-driven 1α-hydroxylase activity, and I must remember that sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, and even unusual granulomatous myositis can present this way, with steroid responsiveness as a supportive clue and biopsy confirmation guiding long-term management when granulomatous disease is suspected [^117NS27X] [^112EbMnE] [^112jnUA4].

> I need to check for medication-related causes that suppress PTH, especially milk-alkali syndrome, which is often overlooked; a careful history of calcium carbonate and alkali intake, often for dyspepsia or osteoporosis prevention, combined with metabolic alkalosis and sometimes renal impairment, should prompt withdrawal of the offending agents and supportive care, and I should also consider exogenous vitamin D intoxication from over-the-counter or compounded products, which can cause severe hypercalcemia and, rarely, neurotoxicity such as PRES in children, necessitating immediate cessation and supportive measures [^117NS27X] [^117RrSvu] [^111JjeJj] [^114jjzc7].

> Next, I should review endocrine etiologies beyond parathyroid disease; hyperthyroidism can increase bone turnover and cause mild hypercalcemia, adrenal insufficiency and pheochromocytoma are rare associations, and immobilization in high-turnover states, particularly in adolescents and children, can provoke hypercalcemia that resolves with remobilization, so I need to ensure I ask about recent fractures, casting, or ICU stays when the story does not fit the usual adult causes [^114Mp6AM] [^114dBa7v].

> I will now examine the laboratory framework more explicitly; with PTH elevated or inappropriately normal, I should prioritize PHPT, FHH, tertiary hyperparathyroidism in CKD, and medication effects like lithium or thiazides, whereas with suppressed PTH, I should prioritize PTHrP-mediated malignancy, local osteolysis, calcitriol-mediated granulomatous disease or lymphoma, vitamin D intoxication, milk-alkali syndrome, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, and immobilization, aligning subsequent testing to these branches to keep the workup efficient and safe [^117NS27X] [^114Mp6AM].

> Let me integrate a practical testing sequence while I double-check each step; first, confirm hypercalcemia and measure intact PTH, then 25-hydroxyvitamin D to exclude deficiency as a confounder and to screen for intoxication, followed by 24-hour urine calcium and creatinine to calculate the CCCR if PHPT versus FHH is in play, then PTHrP, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D when granulomatous disease or lymphoma is suspected; if malignancy is on the table, I should obtain a focused history and exam and proceed with age-appropriate cancer screening or targeted imaging rather than ordering broad panels indiscriminately, reserving parathyroid imaging for surgically candidate PHPT patients after biochemical confirmation [^114DBWVe] [^117NS27X] [^111cwjeB].

> Hold on, I should verify key distinguishing features so I do not misclassify cases; PHPT typically shows hypercalcemia with elevated or inappropriately normal PTH and relatively higher urine calcium, while FHH shows mild hypercalcemia with low urine calcium and a CCCR less than 0.01, and malignancy-associated hypercalcemia generally has suppressed PTH with elevated PTHrP or elevated 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D depending on mechanism, and milk-alkali syndrome often adds metabolic alkalosis and a history of calcium carbonate intake, which together help triage to the correct category before committing to invasive steps [^117NS27X] [^114DBWVe] [^111wsekJ].

> Let me reconsider special scenarios that alter pretest probabilities; in pregnancy, physiologic calcium lowering and nonspecific symptoms can mask PHPT, so I should maintain a high index of suspicion and consider second-trimester surgery for significant hypercalcemia; in pediatrics, immobilization, vitamin D intoxication, and leukemia are relatively more prominent, so I need to tailor testing to age and context; and when PHPT and FHH cannot be separated biochemically, I should escalate to genetic testing rather than proceeding to unnecessary parathyroidectomy, especially given the benign natural history of FHH [^116CyQxS] [^117NS27X] [^113cHcY8] [^11359pDe].

> I should confirm that the initial management of severe hypercalcemia is addressed even as I pursue the differential; isotonic intravenous hydration is first-line to restore intravascular volume and enhance calciuresis, with antiresorptives such as zoledronic acid or denosumab and adjunct calcitonin for rapid lowering in severe cases, while glucocorticoids are reserved for calcitriol-mediated processes like granulomatous disease or lymphoma, and denosumab is preferred in renal insufficiency or when bisphosphonates are contraindicated, all while monitoring for hypocalcemia, renal function, and oral health risks with antiresorptives [^117NS27X] [^111f3qBb] [^114bM9tf] [^1165qPtd] [^1161vCqA].

> Finally, I need to ensure longitudinal care is planned; for confirmed PHPT, I should discuss parathyroidectomy versus observation with monitoring per guideline criteria, for FHH I should counsel against surgery and consider family screening, for malignancy-associated hypercalcemia I should coordinate oncologic care and anticipate recurrence requiring retreatment, and for granulomatous disease I should confirm the diagnosis and consider steroid-sparing regimens when appropriate, documenting response and surveillance for relapse or complications [^115mxSJ5] [^111GMrJW] [^112jnUA4].

Hypercalcemia has a **broad differential** [^117NS27X], but **PTH-dependent causes** (primary hyperparathyroidism, familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, tertiary hyperparathyroidism) and **PTH-independent causes** (malignancy, vitamin D intoxication, granulomatous disease, medications) account for most cases [^114Mp6AM]. Initial evaluation should include **serum PTH** [^117NS27X], 25-hydroxyvitamin D, creatinine/eGFR, and a careful medication and family history [^114DBWVe]. PTH level directs the workup: elevated or inappropriately normal PTH suggests PHPT or FHH [^114DBWVe]; suppressed PTH suggests malignancy, vitamin D excess, or granulomatous disease [^117NS27X]. Differentiating PHPT from FHH requires a **24-hour urine calcium** or calcium/creatinine clearance ratio [^114DBWVe] and, when needed, genetic testing [^11359pDe]. Management depends on severity and etiology, with hydration and antiresorptives for severe cases [^1165qPtd] and definitive therapy for the underlying cause [^117NS27X].

## PTH-dependent hypercalcemia

PTH-dependent hypercalcemia is characterized by **elevated or inappropriately normal PTH** [^117NS27X] despite hypercalcemia.

| **Etiology** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical features** | **Diagnosis** |

## PTH-independent hypercalcemia

PTH-independent hypercalcemia features **suppressed PTH** [^117NS27X] and includes malignancy, vitamin D–mediated causes, and medications.

| **Etiology** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical features** | **Diagnosis** |
|-|-|-|-|
| Malignancy (PTHrP-mediated, osteolytic, calcitriol-mediated) | Tumor production of PTHrP, bone metastases, or calcitriol excess | - Severe hypercalcemia <br/> - Weight loss <br/> - Bone pain [^116uRQtU] | - Suppressed PTH <br/> - Elevated PTHrP or calcitriol <br/> - Imaging for malignancy [^116XRC2f] |
| Vitamin D intoxication | Excess 1,25(OH)2D increasing GI calcium absorption | - Hypercalcemia <br/> - Hypercalciuria <br/> - Nausea <br/> - Vomiting [^111JjeJj] | - Suppressed PTH <br/> - High 25(OH)D <br/> - High/normal 1,25(OH)2D [^notfound] |
| Granulomatous disease (sarcoidosis, TB, lymphoma) | Extra-renal 1α-hydroxylase activity increasing calcitriol | - Pulmonary symptoms <br/> - Skin lesions <br/> - Lymphadenopathy [^notfound] | - Suppressed PTH <br/> - High 1,25(OH)2D <br/> - Low/normal 25(OH)D [^112EbMnE] |
| Medications (thiazides, lithium, calcitriol, calcium supplements) | Increased calcium reabsorption or absorption | Medication history, drug-induced hypercalcemia | - Suppressed PTH <br/> - Medication history [^114DBWVe] |

---

## Initial diagnostic evaluation

A **structured approach** begins with history, exam, and targeted labs:

- **Confirm hypercalcemia**: Corrected total calcium or ionized calcium [^117NS27X].
- **Serum PTH**: Central test to distinguish PTH-dependent vs independent causes [^114DBWVe].
- **25-hydroxyvitamin D**: Evaluate deficiency or intoxication [^114jjzc7].
- **Creatinine/eGFR**: Assess renal function and nephrolithiasis risk [^115jPgSs].
- **Medication and family history**: Identify drug-induced or familial causes [^115u3zma].

---

## Advanced diagnostic testing

Additional tests refine the **differential**:

- **24-hour urine calcium or CCCR**: Differentiate PHPT (CCCR > 0.02) from FHH (CCCR < 0.01) [^111NHvJM].
- **PTHrP**: Suspected malignancy-associated hypercalcemia [^116XRC2f].
- **1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D**: Suspected granulomatous disease or lymphoma [^117NS27X].
- **Genetic testing**: CASR, GNA11, AP2S1 for suspected FHH [^11359pDe].

---

## Clinical features and complications

Hypercalcemia presents with **nonspecific symptoms** — polyuria, polydipsia, dehydration, nephrolithiasis, bone pain, osteoporosis, nausea, vomiting, constipation, confusion, depression, and cardiac arrhythmias [^117NS27X]. Severe hypercalcemia can cause **hypercalcemic crisis** [^115Pifru] with acute kidney injury, encephalopathy, and arrhythmias [^1158y4CC] [^116YydmG].

---

## Management principles

Management is **tailored to severity and etiology**:

- **Mild hypercalcemia**: Address underlying cause, hydration, and observation [^117NS27X].
- **Moderate-to-severe hypercalcemia**: IV hydration, calcitonin, bisphosphonates or denosumab, and glucocorticoids for calcitriol-mediated causes [^111f3qBb] [^114bM9tf].
- **Definitive therapy**: Parathyroidectomy for PHPT, oncology care for malignancy, stopping offending drugs, and steroids for granulomatous disease [^117NS27X].

---

Hypercalcemia has a **broad differential**, but a focused, PTH-first approach [^117NS27X] with selective use of urine calcium, vitamin D metabolites, and imaging efficiently identifies the cause and guides therapy.

### Hypercalcemic hypocalciuria: a critical differential diagnosis for hyperparathyroidism [^111Q1kNX]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2004). Low credibility.

A differential diagnosis for hyperparathyroidism includes all causes of hypercalcemia; the primary causes of which are primary hyperparathyroidism and humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy. Benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a rare condition of primary importance because failure to recognize this entity leads to unnecessary surgery. There are a plethora of other rare causes of hypercalcemia that can be distinguished from primary hyperparathyroidism by history and laboratory profiles. This article discusses the main and less common causes of hypercalcemia and provides guidance for distinguishing among them.

### Hypercalcemia and cancer: differential diagnosis and treatment [^116uRQtU]. CA (2018). Low credibility.

Incidentally detected hypercalcemia usually presents in an indolent manner and is most likely caused by primary hyperparathyroidism. In contrast, hypercalcemia in the patient with a history of cancer presents in a wide range of clinical settings and may be severe enough to warrant hospitalization. This form of hypercalcemia is usually secondary to hypercalcemia of malignancy and can be fatal. Hypercalcemia of malignancy is most commonly mediated by tumoral production of parathyroid hormone-related protein or by cytokines activating osteoclast degradation of bone. The initial workup, differential diagnoses, confirmatory laboratory testing, imaging, and medical and surgical management of hypercalcemia are described in the patient with cancer.

Hypercalcaemia is commonly seen in the context of parathyroid dysfunction and malignancy and, when severe, can precipitate Life-threatening sequelae. The differential of hypercalcaemia is broad and can be categorized based on parathyroid hormone (PTH) Levels. The acute management of severe hypercalcaemia is discussed along with a brief review of therapeutic advances in the field.

### Imaging features of hypercalcemia: a primer for emergency radiologists [^112iS33U]. Clinical Imaging (2021). Medium credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a marker for a wide variety of underlying etiologies, and its presentation in the emergency setting may be asymptomatic, incidental, or a primary complaint with associated symptoms and physical exam findings. While the workup is initially driven through serum laboratory testing, imaging plays an important role in diagnosis and post-treatment follow up. This review covers multiple common and uncommon etiologies of hypercalcemia, details their underlying mechanisms, and identifies the most important associated imaging findings. It is important for radiologists to be familiar with these etiologies and imaging findings, particularly in the emergency setting since hypercalcemia may represent the only significant laboratory abnormality associated with the presenting condition. Furthermore, the radiologist's interpretation of a study may be directly influenced by knowing about a patient's hypercalcemia.

### Acute management of hypercalcemia of malignancy – A review of pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^115pY2Q7]. Current Oncology Reports (2025). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Hypercalcemia of malignancy is one of the most common metabolic disorders in patients with cancer and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This narrative review summarizes pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnostic strategies, and therapies available for the management of hypercalcemia of malignancy in acutely ill adult patients.

Recent Findings

We reviewed both classic and recent literature to provide practical recommendations for managing cancer-related hypercalcemia. Our findings are presented in the context of recently published societal guidelines. Timely identification and treatment of acute hypercalcemia of malignancy is vital. Understanding of the underlying disease processes and available therapies is needed to optimize patient care and healthcare resource utilization.

### Investigation and management of hypocalcaemia [^111P3pbr]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2020). Medium credibility.

Hypocalcaemia is a common clinical scenario in children with a range of aetiological causes. It will often present with common symptoms but may occasionally be identified in an asymptomatic child. An understanding of the physiological regulation of plasma calcium is important in understanding the potential cause of hypocalcaemia and its appropriate management. The age of presentation will influence the likely differential diagnosis. We have presented a stepwise approach to the investigation of hypocalcaemia dependent on the circulating serum parathyroid hormone level at the time of presentation. The acute and long-term management of the underlying condition is also reviewed.

### Diagnosis of asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism: proceedings of the fourth international workshop [^113jGG36]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2014). Low credibility.

Objective

Asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a common clinical problem. The purpose of this report is to provide an update on the use of diagnostic tests for this condition in clinical practice.

Participants

This subgroup was constituted by the Steering Committee to address key questions related to the diagnosis of PHPT. Consensus was established at a closed meeting of the Expert Panel that followed.

Evidence

Each question was addressed by a relevant literature search (on PubMed), and the data were presented for discussion at the group meeting.

Consensus Process

Consensus was achieved by a group meeting. Statements were prepared by all authors, with comments relating to accuracy from the diagnosis subgroup and by representatives from the participating professional societies.

Conclusions

We conclude that: 1) reference ranges should be established for serum PTH in vitamin D-replete healthy individuals; 2) second- and third-generation PTH assays are both helpful in the diagnosis of PHPT; 3) normocalcemic PHPT is a variant of the more common presentation of PHPT with hypercalcemia; 4) serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations should be measured and, if vitamin D insufficiency is present, it should be treated as part of any management course; 5) genetic testing has the potential to be useful in the differential diagnosis of familial hyperparathyroidism or hypercalcemia.

### Consensus statement on vitamin D status assessment and supplementation: whys, whens, and hows [^114jjzc7]. Endocrine Reviews (2024). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, VDT is a rare but life-threatening event mostly caused by unintentional overdosing due to pharmaceutical products. The prescriber and dispenser should avoid unlicensed vitamin D products. VDT should always be considered a differential diagnosis when evaluating patients with hypercalcemia. Future studies should encompass the evaluation of concurrent conditions that increase the risk of VDT and include the evaluation of classic and nonclassic adverse events for VDT.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for primary hyperparathyroidism, more specifically with respect to diagnosis, CTFH 2017 guidelines recommend to confirm the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism if serum calcium is elevated (total calcium corrected for albumin or elevated ionized calcium) in the presence of an elevated or inappropriately normal PTH in the absence of conditions mimicking primary hyperparathyroidism (thiazide diuretics or lithium) and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia.

### A practical approach to hypercalcemia [^113ziSUT]. American Family Physician (2003). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a disorder commonly encountered by primary care physicians. The diagnosis often is made incidentally in asymptomatic patients. Clinical manifestations affect the neuromuscular, gastrointestinal, renal, skeletal, and cardiovascular systems. The most common causes of hypercalcemia are primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy. Some other important causes of hypercalcemia are medications and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia. An initial diagnostic work-up should include measurement of intact parathyroid hormone, and any medications that are likely to be causative should be discontinued. Parathyroid hormone is suppressed in malignancy-associated hypercalcemia and elevated in primary hyperparathyroidism. It is essential to exclude other causes before considering parathyroid surgery, and patients should be referred for parathyroidectomy only if they meet certain criteria. Many patients with primary hyperparathyroidism have a benign course and do not need surgery. Hypercalcemic crisis is a life-threatening emergency. Aggressive intravenous rehydration is the mainstay of management in severe hypercalcemia, and antiresorptive agents, such as calcitonin and bisphosphonates, frequently can alleviate the clinical manifestations of hypercalcemic disorders.

### Rapid fire: hypercalcemia [^116M4fpB]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is commonly encountered in the clinical setting and requires identification by the clinician to avoid disastrous patient outcomes. The 2 most common causes are malignancy and hyperparathyroidism. The underlying cause for hypercalcemia may be readily known at presentation or may require further investigation. After identification, acuity of treatment will depend on severity of calcium level and symptoms. In the emergency setting, intravenous hydration with isotonic fluids is the treatment mainstay. Other commonly used medications to further decrease calcium include bisphosphates, calcitonin, steroids, and (rarely) furosemide. In life-threatening circumstances, dialysis can be implemented.

### Hypercalcemic crisis: a clinical review [^115Pifru]. The American Journal of Medicine (2015). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a common metabolic perturbation. However, hypercalcemic crisis is an unusual endocrine emergency, with little clinical scientific data to support therapeutic strategy. We review the relevant scientific English literature on the topic and review current management strategies after conducting a PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar search for articles published between 1930 and June 2014 using specific keywords: "hypercalcemic crisis", "hyperparathyroid crisis", "parathyroid storm", "severe primary hyperparathyroidism", "acute hyperparathyroidism", and "severe hypercalcemia" for articles pertaining to the diagnosis, epidemiology, clinical presentation, and treatment strategies. Despite extensive clinical experience, large and well-designed clinical studies to direct appropriate clinical care are lacking. Nonetheless, morbidity and mortality rates have substantially decreased since early series reported almost universal fatality. Improved outcomes can be attributed to modern diagnostic capabilities, leading to earlier diagnosis, along with the recognition that primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common etiology for hypercalcemic crisis. Hypercalcemic crisis is an unusual endocrine emergency that portends excellent outcomes if rapid diagnosis, medical treatment, and definitive surgical treatment are expedited.

### Child with suspected hypocalcemia [^116TNHqW]. PES (2020). High credibility.

Child with suspected hypocalcemia — differential diagnosis is broadly classified into 3 categories: parathyroid hormone related (hypoparathyroidism due to various causes either congenital or acquired; pseudohypoparathyroidism: the parathyroid hormone is not able to act due to defective PTH receptor), vitamin D related (vitamin D deficiency due to poor nutritional intake, malabsorption, liver disease or kidney disease leading to defective 25-hydroxylation and 1, α-hydroxylation respectively; 1, α-hydroxylase deficiency leading to deficient active form of vitamin D; vitamin D resistance due to defective vitamin D receptor), and nutritional calcium deficiency.

### Persistent hypercalcemia with similar familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia features: a case report and literature review [^111SXxBy]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypercalcemia has an expanded differential diagnosis of approximately over 25 diseases. Mild-to-moderate hypercalcemia with non-suppressed or high parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels present in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), typically. PHPT is a common endocrine disorder among the general population especially in middle age people and the female gender. Factors favoring PHPT include a history of renal calculi, an asymptomatic patient with a stable prolonged mild hypercalcemia, and rarely the induction of hypercalcemia by thiazides. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) and the use of certain medications, such as lithium, could mimic PHPT presentations and should be considered in the differential diagnoses of hypercalcemia with non-suppressed PTH.

FHH, also called familial benign hypercalcemia, was initially introduced as a variant of PHPT. It is a rare autosomal-dominant disorder with very low urinary calcium excretion and mild hypercalcemia with high normal or slightly elevated PTH. FHH is a life-long condition that is usually caused by one of many heterozygous inactivating mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor (CASR) gene, which could up-regulate the set point of parathyroid cells. When the CASR receptor is inactivated, PTH is not suppressed despite its relatively high calcium, which makes FHH similar to PHPT. In PHPT, although the renal reabsorption of calcium is higher than normal due to the high PTH level, hypercalciuria still occurs. However, in FHH due to CASR inactivation, a general calcium hyposensitivity occurs which results in more tubular calcium reabsorption. So, calcium/creatinine clearance ratio (CCCR = [24 h urine calcium/ total plasma calcium] × [plasma creatinine /24 h urine creatinine]) is lower in FHH compared to PHPT.

In addition to familial forms of FHH which existed from the beginning of life, there are other acquired and sporadic forms with unrevealing family screening; including de novo CASR gene mutations, and CASR autoantibodies. Patients with CASR autoantibodies mimic the hereditary FHH in biochemical phenotype and could develop FHH-like syndrome. Auto-immune hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is different in pathogenesis from the one caused by inactivating mutations of the CASR. So, a combination of clinical suspicion, biochemical testing, and genetic analysis is needed to distinguish FHH from PHPT. This case is challenging because findings in this case report were not entirely consistent with any of FHH, PHPT, and FHH-like syndrome.

### Evaluation of hypercalcemia in relation to hyperparathyroidism [^1116ou48]. Otolaryngologic Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia, which results from the rate of calcium influx into the extracellular fluid exceeding the rate of calcium efflux from the extracellular fluid, has been reported as occurring in approximately 1% to 4% of the adult population in general, and anywhere from 0.5% to 3% of hospitalized adult populations. Hypercalcemia associated with primary hyperparathyroidism has frequently resulted in the development of pancreatitis and peptic ulcer disease; however, the pathophysiologic mechanism of this association remains uncertain. This article examines the etiology and differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia, in particular regarding its association with primary hyperparathyroidism.

### Endocrine disorders with parathyroid hormone-independent hypercalcemia [^114Mp6AM]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

The most common causes of hypercalcemia are primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy, constituting 80% to 90% of all cases. Although less common, several nonparathyroid endocrine disorders are associated with hypercalcemia. The most well described is hyperthyroidism, although the reported prevalence of hypercalcemia in hyperthyroid patients varies depending on applied method for measuring serum calcium levels. Also, adrenal insufficiency, pheochromocytoma, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide are associated with hypercalcemia. These are differential diagnoses when assessing the hypercalcemic patient for whom common causes have been excluded. Further investigation is needed regarding hypothyroidism; acromegaly, hyperprolactinemia, gonadal dysfunction, and diabetes are not associated with hyperthyroidism.

### Severe hypercalcemia in a postpartum patient [^117RrSvu]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

There are multiple clinical manifestations of hypercalcemia and several causes of hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia caused by milk-alkali syndrome is increasing in frequency.

Case Report

A 26-year-old woman presented after having undergone caesarian section. She complained of severe myalgias, arthralgias, an inability to ambulate, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and marked depression. Each of these symptoms has a broad differential diagnosis, but when considered together the theme "stones, bones, moans, and groans", seen in patients with hypercalcemia, is evident. This patient was found to have hypercalcemia caused by milk-alkali syndrome related to the ingestion of calcium carbonate. Her symptoms and hypercalcemia resolved with treatment. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS? Emergency physicians should be aware of the many different symptoms of hypercalcemia. This case emphasizes the need for a careful medication history for any patient presenting with hypercalcemia, including over the counter medications. Physicians should have a high level of suspicion for milk-alkali syndrome in patients with hypercalcemia because milk-alkali syndrome is no longer a rare etiology but rather one of the most common causes of hypercalcemia.

### Calcitonin: current concepts and differential diagnosis [^112gAUDc]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

This review outlines the current biosynthetic and physiology concepts about CT and presents up-to-date information regarding the differential diagnosis of its elevation in various clinical situations. CT measurement as a diagnostic marker has not been without problems, mainly because of inaccuracies inserted by the detection methods, as well as because of lack of widely accepted age and gender cutoff bCT values. Only recently, advances in the various CT measurement assays allowed more precise estimation of CT cutoff points especially regarding MTC diagnosis. However, a gray zone area still exists, in which the differentiation mainly between MTC and CCH or other rare causes of increased serum CT levels set the basis for the clinical use of Pg or calcium stimulation tests. Recently, however, the stimulating tests have been disputed. Consequently, their use in clinical practice currently declines, because of lack of valid stimulated CT values, the missing availability of Pg, and the side effects of calcium infusion. An emerging role of ProCT has been well described in the recent literature that allows for better diagnostics of MTC.

If elevated CT is incidentally discovered, all efforts should focus on the exclusion of MTC. Renal insufficiency, acute hypercalcemia, hypergastrinemia, or drug adverse effect may be easily excluded by thorough clinical evaluation of the patient. The subsequent diagnostic steps depend on the bCT serum levels. bCT > 100 pg/ml is indicative of MTC, whereas CCH or CT-secreting NENs are associated with mild CT elevation and blunted or no response to stimulating test. In any case, CT-secreting NENs are a rare clinical occurrence in cases of incidental CT elevation. bCT values between 60 and 100 pg/ml for males and 30 and 80 pg/ml for females using the latest ICMAs should still imply MTC, until proven otherwise. bCT values < 60 pg/ml for males and < 30 pg/ml for females may be followed in a watch and wait strategy or undertake calcium stimulation test. In case hypercalcitoninemia cannot attributed to an existing thyroid pathology, proof of extrathyroidal etiology must include detailed clinical re-evaluation and appropriate laboratory and imaging modalities.

### Hypercalcemia: a review [^117NS27X]. JAMA (2022). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Hypercalcemia affects approximately 1% of the worldwide population. Mild hypercalcemia, defined as total calcium of less than 12 mg/dL (< 3 mmol/L) or ionized calcium of 5.6 to 8.0 mg/dL (1.4–2 mmol/L), is usually asymptomatic but may be associated with constitutional symptoms such as fatigue and constipation in approximately 20% of people. Hypercalcemia that is severe, defined as total calcium of 14 mg/dL or greater (> 3.5 mmol/L) or ionized calcium of 10 mg/dL or greater (≥ 2.5 mmol/L) or that develops rapidly over days to weeks, can cause nausea, vomiting, dehydration, confusion, somnolence, and coma.

Observations

Approximately 90% of people with hypercalcemia have primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) or malignancy. Additional causes of hypercalcemia include granulomatous disease such as sarcoidosis, endocrinopathies such as thyroid disease, immobilization, genetic disorders, and medications such as thiazide diuretics and supplements such as calcium, vitamin D, or vitamin A. Hypercalcemia has been associated with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 protein inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, denosumab discontinuation, SARS-CoV-2, ketogenic diets, and extreme exercise, but these account for less than 1% of causes. Serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH), the most important initial test to evaluate hypercalcemia, distinguishes PTH-dependent from PTH-independent causes. In a patient with hypercalcemia, an elevated or normal PTH concentration is consistent with PHPT, while a suppressed PTH level (< 20 pg/mL depending on assay) indicates another cause. Mild hypercalcemia usually does not need acute intervention. If due to PHPT, parathyroidectomy may be considered depending on age, serum calcium level, and kidney or skeletal involvement. In patients older than 50 years with serum calcium levels less than 1 mg above the upper normal limit and no evidence of skeletal or kidney disease, observation may be appropriate. Initial therapy of symptomatic or severe hypercalcemia consists of hydration and intravenous bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic acid or pamidronate. In patients with kidney failure, denosumab and dialysis may be indicated. Glucocorticoids may be used as primary treatment when hypercalcemia is due to excessive intestinal calcium absorption (vitamin D intoxication, granulomatous disorders, some lymphomas). Treatment reduces serum calcium and improves symptoms, at least transiently. The underlying cause of hypercalcemia should be identified and treated. The prognosis for asymptomatic PHPT is excellent with either medical or surgical management. Hypercalcemia of malignancy is associated with poor survival.

Conclusions and Relevance

Mild hypercalcemia is typically asymptomatic, while severe hypercalcemia is associated with nausea, vomiting, dehydration, confusion, somnolence, and coma. Asymptomatic hypercalcemia due to primary hyperparathyroidism is managed with parathyroidectomy or observation with monitoring, while severe hypercalcemia is typically treated with hydration and intravenous bisphosphonates.

### Neurosarcoidosis: pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment [^112jnUA4]. Neurology (2021). Medium credibility.

Diagnosis and Differential Diagnosis

Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of NS is summarized in Table 1 and is heavily influenced by the presenting neurologic syndrome. Sarcoidosis is fundamentally a pathologic diagnosis, and biopsy from affected tissue is strongly recommended to support a final diagnosis. Rigorous exclusion of mimics is particularly important, and even with pathologic confirmation of granulomatous inflammation consistent with sarcoidosis, there is also a histologic differential diagnosis to consider. Granulomatous infections and, rarely, granulomatous reactions associated with lymphoma can have histopathologic findings similar to those seen in sarcoidosis. A multisystem granulomatous syndrome phenotypically similar to sarcoidosis (and sometimes NS) has been observed to develop in 8%–22% of patients with common variable immunodeficiency, a heterogenous group of antibody deficiencies characterized by hypogammaglobulinemia and symptoms of immunodeficiency including infection and autoimmunity. Rigorous clinical-radiologic phenotyping and follow-up remain critical even with biopsy confirmation. Clear worsening or lack of a partial response to immunosuppressive treatment in patients with probable or possible NS warrants diagnostic reconsideration.

Neurosarcoidosis Diagnostic Criteria

Updated consensus NS diagnostic criteria were published in 2018 and categorize patients based on diagnostic certainty into definite, probable, and possible NS based on pathologic and clinical features, emphasizing clinical phenotype and biopsy confirmation (Table 2).

Table 2
Clinical Criteria for a Diagnosis of Neurosarcoidosis (2018 Neurosarcoidosis Consortium Consensus)

Serum Testing

Because neither sensitive nor specific serum tests for sarcoidosis diagnosis exist to date, the primary value of serum testing is to evaluate for alternative etiologies and for markers of other organ system manifestations of sarcoidosis (Table 3). Acute-phase reactants may be elevated but are non specific. Hypervitaminosis D and hypercalcemia are occasionally present and should prompt evaluation for hyperparathyroidism. Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels are elevated in up to 60% of patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis, but are insensitive and nonspecific. A 2019 study identified serum soluble IL-2 receptor levels to be 88% sensitive and 85% specific for sarcoidosis compared with 62% and 76%, respectively, for ACE.

Hypercalcaemia is a far less common finding in children than in adults. It may present with characteristic symptoms or may be identified as a coincidental finding in children investigated for a variety of complaints. Assessment of hypercalcaemia requires an understanding of the normal physiological regulation of plasma calcium by the combined actions of parathyroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) and the calcium sensing receptor. Hypercalcaemia will usually require treatment using a number of different modalities but occasionally it can be due to a benign asymptomatic condition that requires no intervention. This article presents a logical approach to the investigation and subsequent management of this condition.

Elevated serum CT levels: causes and controversies

Overproduction

Endogenous CT secretion can be increased as a physiologic consequence of excessive stimuli, such as hypercalcemia and hypergastrinemia. Primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy are the most common causes of hypercalcemia, accounting for ~90% of cases. However, chronic hypercalcemia is a rare cause of CT elevation. Oral calcium administration elicits diverse hormonal response in these cases that helps in the differential diagnosis of these conditions. Thyroid parafollicular cells can express calcium-sensing receptor like the one expressed on the parathyroid gland. In contrast to PTH, though, binding of the receptor stimulates CT release. Hypergastrinemia can be caused by achlorhydria (e.g. pernicious anemia, atrophic gastritis, antacids) or Zollinger–Ellison syndrome. Finally, CT can be elevated in various situations in which its precursors are elevated, such as pancreatitis, bacterial inflammation, sepsis, or CGRP inhibitors (migraine treatment).

Overproduction of CT can also be caused primarily and not as a response to CT secretagogues. While not pathognomonic, elevated CT is mostly associated with MTC and serves as a diagnostic and prognostic tool as described in the previous chapters. However, MTC is not the only thyroid pathology that can present with hypercalcitoninemia (Table 1).

Table 1.
Causes and clinical relevance of hypercalcitoninemia relative to bCT and stimulated serum CT values.

CCHhas been associated with slight increases of both basal (10–30 mg/dl) and stimulated serum CT levels (< 560 mg/dl). CCH derives its clinical significance upon whether it constitutes a premalignant condition or not. CCH has been found in up to 33% in autopsy studies of subjects without known thyroid disorders and is twice more common in men than women. More frequently, it may be found in older patients and in those with coexisting hyperparathyroidism, hypergastrinemia, and autoimmune thyroiditis. Interestingly enough, CCH has been described in proximity to follicular-derived thyroid tumors, especially malignant ones. Significantly, CCH that occurs secondarily after hyperparathyroidism, chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, renal insufficiency, and aging is not considered premalignant. Conversely, CCH that occurs in hereditary MTC precedes the development of MTC and carries a definite neoplastic potential.

Introduction

Primary hyperparathyroidism is an endocrine disorder caused by one or more hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands. The suspicion of pHPT is typically raised by the detection of hypercalcemia and/or its associated symptoms. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) serum concentration is elevated, or within normal limits but inappropriate considering the presence of hypercalcemia. A rare type of pHPT is normocalcemic hyperparathyroidism presenting with normal serum calcium levels but an elevated PTH concentration.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is the third most common endocrine disease, affecting women 2–3 times more often than men. It is caused by the hyperfunction of one or more parathyroid glands, which are overproducing PTH. Hyperfunctioning parathyroid glands are solitary adenomas in the majority of cases. Approximately 15–20% of cases are caused by multiglandular disease (MGD), i.e. multiple adenomas or hyperplasia, while parathyroid carcinoma accounts for less than 1% of cases. The majority of pHPT cases (95%) occur sporadically, but approximately 5% are part of hereditary syndromes, such as multiple endocrine neoplasia types 1, 2, and 4 (MEN-1, MEN-2, and MEN-4) and hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome, or as part of non-syndromic familial pHPT.

Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, a potential differential diagnosis to pHPT, has to be recognized as it usually does not require surgery.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a disorder characterized by increased serum PTH levels due to parathyroid gland hyperplasia, triggered by hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, or decreased serum vitamin D concentration. The most common causes of sHPT are vitamin D deficiency and chronic renal disease. Sometimes pHPT and vitamin D deficiency occur simultaneously, which results in decreased or normal serum calcium levels. Rarer causes are long-term treatment with lithium or magnesium, intestinal malabsorption or malnutrition, or sunitinib treatment.

The therapy of sHPT depends on the primary cause. In the case of renal HPT, therapy mainly consists of a restriction of dietary intake together with medical treatment with calcimimetics, vitamin D analogues, and phosphorus binders. Still, parathyroidectomy is required in patients with renal sHPT refractory to medical treatment, i.e. in approximately 15% of patients after 10 years and 38% of patients after 20 years of renal dialysis therapy.

### Approach to diagnosis and treatment of hypercalcemia in a patient with malignancy [^111wsekJ]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia is a common complication of malignancy and portends a worse prognosis. It causes a variety of symptoms in patients, which can range from confusion and polyuria to coma and death. There are 4 broad mechanistic categories to classify hypercalcemia of malignancy: local osteolysis secondary to metastatic cancer or multiple myeloma, excess parathyroid-related hormone, excess 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D production, and ectopic parathyroid hormone production. Volume expansion with normal saline solution and treatment with intravenous bisphosphonates to decrease osteoclast-mediated bone destruction are effective initial therapies. Calcitonin, gallium nitrate, and corticosteroids can serve as adjunctive therapies. Denosumab is an attractive therapeutic option for refractory cases of hypercalcemia, although more data are required before this therapy can be recommended.

### Hypovitaminosis D masking hypercalcemia in primary hyperparathyroidism: case report [^115YZ1d6]. Therapeutic Advances in Endocrinology and Metabolism (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypovitaminosis D or vitamin D deficiency is defined as serum vitamin D levels below 20 ng/mL, while levels below 10 or 12 ng/mL are considered severe deficiency. Prevalence of vitamin D deficiency is around 40% while severe deficiency is 13% in Europe. Severe vitamin D deficiency is associated with the risk of osteomalacia presenting as diffuse bone pain and tenderness. Biochemically, it is characterized by low or low normal serum calcium, phosphorus, and secondary hyperparathyroidism.

Primary hyperparathyroidism (HPTH) is common occurring in up to 82 cases per 100,000 people. It is characterized by normocalcemia or variable degrees of hypercalcemia associated with high or inappropriately normal parathormone (PTH). More than 80% are asymptomatic, however, up to 63% have osteopenia/osteoporosis and up to 20% have nephrolithiasis/nephrocalcinosis.

Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) is a rare autosomal dominant benign cause of hypercalcemia. It is characterized by mild early-onset hypercalcemia, unsuppressed, or, in a quarter of patients, high PTH. It is differentiated from primary HPTH by a characteristic low urinary calcium excretion.

In this report, when hypovitaminosis D – an essentially hypocalcemic state – and primary HPTH – an essentially hypercalcemic state – are combined in the same patient, this will modify the initial presentation and cause a rethinking of the differential diagnosis in the course of managing this patient.

The differential diagnosis depends largely on the clinical presentation of sarcoidosis. It is critical to exclude granulomatous pulmonary infections, especially those caused by mycobacteria and fungi. Exclude neoplastic diseases, such as lymphoma, in cases with hilar adenopathy. Hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis may mimic metabolic disorders, such as primary hyperparathyroidism. Early-onset sarcoidosis is often misdiagnosed as systemic-onset JRA. Rarely, severe symptomatic bone marrow involvement may mimic a number of infectious and neoplastic disorders.

### Prenatal bone abnormalities in three cases of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia [^1113eSKF]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Prenatal diagnosis of bone and mineralization anomalies is associated with a wide range of etiologies and prognoses. The improvement of antenatal ultrasound combined with the development of molecular diagnosis in genetics has transformed antenatal medicine into a challenging discipline. Of the various known causes of bone abnormalities and hypomineralization, calcium and phosphate metabolism disorders are exceptional. An accurate diagnosis is crucial for providing appropriate genetic counseling and medical follow-up after birth.

Case

We report on three siblings with severe bone abnormalities diagnosed during the second trimester ultrasound of pregnancy. Postnatal follow-up showed transitory hyperparathyroidism, with hypercalcemia and hypocalciuria.

Methods

Sanger sequencing performed after birth in the three newborns revealed a monoallelic pathogenic variant in the CASR gene, encoding the calcium sensing receptor, confirming the diagnosis of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, paternally inherited. Postnatal evolution was favorable after treatment with a calcimimetic agent.

Conclusions

Previously, prenatal bone abnormalities caused by familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia had only been described in one patient. This entity should be considered as differential diagnosis of bones abnormalities. Knowing about this unusual etiology is important to guide the diagnosis, the prenatal counseling and to improve medical management.

### Hypercalcemic crisis [^1158y4CC]. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (2001). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia may decompensate from a more or less chronic status into a critical and life-threatening condition, hypercalcemic crisis. In the majority of cases, primary hyperparathyroidism is the cause; humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy or rarer conditions of hypercalcemia will decompensate less often. The leading symptoms that characterize the crisis are oliguria and anuria as well as somnolence and coma. After a hypercalcemic crisis is recognized, an emergency diagnostic program has to be followed either to prove or to exclude primary hyperparathyroidism. In the first case, surgical neck exploration is the only way to avoid fatal outcome. The diagnostic program should be performed within hours; during this time, serum calcium should be lowered. Treatment of choice is hemodialysis against a calcium-free dialysate. Bisphosphonates could be useful as adjuvant drugs.

### A rare case report of immobility-induced hypercalcemia in an infant [^114dBa7v]. Pediatrics (2016). Low credibility.

Immobility-induced hypercalcemia is a rare cause of hypercalcemia in children, and to our knowledge it has never been reported in an infant. Infants and children are in a state of high bone turnover. Therefore, they are prone to the imbalance of osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity that occurs with prolonged immobilization, leading to hypercalcemia. Here we present the case of an infant with hypercalcemia who presented with fatigue, irritability, and failure to thrive after prolonged immobilization. Therapeutic interventions were conservative and included hydration and increased mobility leading to complete resolution. This case highlights the importance of including this rare entity in a differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia as well as screening postsurgical patients with prolonged immobility for hypercalcemia.

### Rare causes of hypercalcemia: 2021 update [^116b7eai]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Context

Primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy are the etiologies in 90% of cases of hypercalcemia. When these entities are not the etiology of hypercalcemia, uncommon conditions need to be considered. In 2005, Jacobs and Bilezikian published a clinical review of rare causes of hypercalcemia, focusing on mechanisms and pathophysiology. This review is an updated synopsis of rare causes of hypercalcemia, extending the observations of the original article.

Evidence Acquisition

Articles reporting rare associations between hypercalcemia and unusual conditions were identified through a comprehensive extensive PubMed-based search using the search terms "hypercalcemia" and "etiology", as well as examining the references in the identified case reports. We categorized the reports by adults vs pediatric and further categorized the adult reports based on etiology. Some included reports lacked definitive assessment of etiology and are reported as unknown mechanism with discussion of likely etiology.

Evidence Synthesis

There is a growing understanding of the breadth of unusual causes of hypercalcemia. When the cause of hypercalcemia is elusive, a focus on mechanism and review of prior reported cases is key to successful determination of the etiology.

Conclusions

The ever-expanding reports of patients with rare and even unknown mechanisms of hypercalcemia illustrate the need for continued investigation into the complexities of human calcium metabolism.

### Primary hyperparathyroidism is underdiagnosed and suboptimally treated in the clinical setting [^117MfMgy]. World Journal of Surgery (2018). Low credibility.

Mild pHPT is often overtly asymptomatic but can cause silent organ damage which progresses over time. It is known that some patients will suffer progressive hypercalcaemia or organ damage, but, even today, there is no way of predicting which patients with biochemically mild pHPT will benefit from surgery. Therefore, it is important to evaluate every indication for treatment, even in patients with mild pHPT. A study in a North American specialist clinic reported the same frequency of nephrolithiasis in normocalcaemic patients as in those with hypercalcaemia. However, bone density was higher in the normocalcaemic patients. In a group consisting of 52 patients with pHPT, but not meeting any indications for treatment at baseline, 27% of conservatively managed patients developed at least one indication for surgery over a 10-year period. Surgery also had the same effect on normalizing serum calcium and PTH as well as on self-reported symptoms, and this was regardless of whether patients were normocalcaemic or hypercalcaemic before surgery. One study reported that the effect of parathyroidectomy on quality of life in patients with mild pHPT was at least as good as in hypercalcaemic patients. Based on these facts, international guidelines recommend careful investigation of possible organ damage and symptoms after considering differential diagnoses and establishing the diagnosis of pHPT. Selected cases should be offered surgery, and to those not meeting indications for treatment, regular checks of serum calcium and development of organ damage should be offered. In the final cohort of 23 patients, surprisingly few were overtly asymptomatic when evaluated with a simple questionnaire. Altogether, 19 patients reported malaise, weakness or reduced power of concentration. One patient suffered from nephrolithiasis and another patient reported osteoporosis.

We can only speculate on the consequences of the delay to potential treatment. However, it is reasonable to assume that a minor group of patients will deteriorate in their biochemical profile and would have benefitted from an early diagnosis, proper monitoring and treatment. For the majority of cases, reduced bone mineral density, the risk of cardiovascular disease and other symptoms of pHPT as, e.g. nephrocalcinosis, also could be assumed to worsen over time.

The reason why the calcium and PTH analyses were ordered was sparsely reported. However, calcium analysis is part of a routine package of analyses available to physicians and is frequently ordered when a screening of the patients' renal function and electrolyte levels is demanded. In most cases, an incidental finding of hypercalcemia seems to have been the reason for the analysis of PTH.

### Parathyroid hormone-related protein: an unusual mechanism for hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis [^112hkJvF]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) as a mediator of hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis.

Methods

We present a detailed case report including history, physical, laboratory testing, pathology findings, and follow-up data over 2 years. We also propose a possible mechanism for PTHrP-mediated hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis.

Results

A 56-year-old man presented with abdominal pain, fatigue, and excess thirst. Routine laboratory testing demonstrated severe hypercalcemia. The patient was admitted for treatment and work-up. Inpatient work-up was significant for suppressed parathyroid hormone, low 25-hydroxyvitamin D, normal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and elevated PTHrP. The patient was treated for hypercalcemia and discharged for follow-up. Malignancy screening included computed tomography of the chest, which revealed parenchymal nodules and diffuse lymphadenopathy. Biopsy revealed nonnecrotizing granulomatous inflammation with positive PTHrP staining by immunohistochemistry. After treatment with intravenous hydration and glucocorticoids, the hypercalcemia resolved and on subsequent follow-up, PTHrP levels had normalized to 0.5 pmol/L.

Conclusion

PTHrP may be a possible mediator of hypercalcemia in sarcoidosis. The differential diagnosis of PTHrP-induced hypercalcemia should include sarcoidosis, and further research is needed to establish the incidence and source of PTHrP in sarcoidosis.

### Clinical characteristics of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia type 1: a multicentre study of 77 adult patients [^112SGKQq]. Clinical Endocrinology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcaemia type 1 (FHH1), related to heterozygous loss-of-function mutations of the calcium-sensing receptor gene, is the main differential diagnosis for primary hyperparathyroidism. The aim of our study was to describe clinical characteristics of adult patients living in France with a genetically confirmed FHH1.

Design and Patients

This observational, retrospective, multicentre study included 77 adults, followed up in 32 clinical departments in France, with a genetic FHH1 diagnosis between 2001 and 2012.

Results

Hypercalcaemia was diagnosed at a median age of 53 years [IQR: 38–61]. The diagnosis was made after clinical manifestations, routine analysis or familial screening in 56, 34 and 10% of cases, respectively, (n = 58; data not available for 19 patients). Chondrocalcinosis was present in 11/51 patients (22%), bone fractures in 8/56 (14%) and renal colic in 6/55 (11%). The median serum calcium was 2.74 mmol/L [IQR: 2.63–2.86 mmol/L], the median plasma parathyroid hormone level was 4.9 pmol/L [3.1–7.1], and the median 24-hour urinary calcium excretion was 2.8 mmol/24 hours [IQR: 1.9–4.0]. Osteoporosis (dual X-ray absorptiometry) or kidney stones (renal ultrasonography) were found in 6/38 patients (16%) and 9/32 patients (28%), respectively. Fourteen patients (18%) underwent parathyroid surgery; parathyroid adenoma was found in three patients (21%) and parathyroid hyperplasia in nine patients (64%). No correlation between genotype and phenotype was established.

Conclusion

This large cohort study demonstrates that FHH1 clinical characteristics can be atypical in 33 patients (43%). Clinicians should be aware of this rare differential diagnosis in order to adopt an appropriate treatment strategy.

### Steroid responsive idiopathic calcitriol induced hypercalcemia: a case report and review of the literature [^111oJqD5]. BMC Nephrology (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Symptomatic hypercalcemia with subsequent nephrolithiasis is not an uncommon problem in the clinical arena. The vast majority of patients present in the context of primary hyperparathyroidism or lymphoma. Alternatively, an important category for consideration is granulomatosis disease such as sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, fungal infections, leprosy, and Crohn's disease. The unifying mechanism, best exemplified by sarcoidosis, is associated with increased extra-renal 1α-hydroxylase activation in macrophages, leading to increased 1,25(OH) 2 D (calcitriol) levels. Less common causes, such as the injection of silicone for cosmetic purposes and paraffin oil in young male bodybuilders, can lead to granulomatosis inflammation and hypercalcemia through a similar mechanism.

Other endocrine disorders could also present with symptomatic hypercalcemia encompass adrenal insufficiency, primary hyperparathyroidism, vitamin D or A intoxication. The differential is broad and the following work-up emphasizes common etiologies, yet idiopathic calcitriol induced hypercalcemia has emerged as a rare diagnosis of exclusion over the years. Only a few case reports have reported cases of idiopathic calcitriol induced hypercalcemia with successful treatment using corticosteroids. Our aim is to add to this literature to reaffirm this possible diagnosis without elevation of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). We therefore present the case of a man with recurrent nephrolithiasis, hypercalcemia, and acute kidney injury.

### Giant parathyroid adenoma associated with severe hypercalcemia in an adolescent patient [^1163tyD7]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2017). Low credibility.

Background

The objective of this study is to bring attention to the importance of differential diagnosis in adolescent patients with skeletal involvement and hypercalcemia.

Case

A 17-year-old male patient with a complaint of severe leg pain was admitted to our hospital. Seven months before he had a fracture of his distal humerus after falling on to his left shoulder and was treated conservatively. Five months previously, he had a rupture of his quadriceps tendon. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed for the quadriceps tendon rupture and was evaluated as polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (PFD). Doctors decided to operate for the ruptured tendon but they detected severe hypercalcemia in the pre-operative blood tests and noticed that the main disease was primary hyper-parathyroidisim (PHPT) which was caused by a giant parathyroid adenoma. Conclusions Giant parathyroid adenoma can present in adolescent patients with multiple bone lesions and severe hypercalcemia. PHPT should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pathological bone fractures and benign bone tumors in every age. This may prevent patients from miss or delayed diagnosis of PHPT.

### Persistent hypercalcemia with similar familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia features: a case report and literature review [^117FTKUz]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) and familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) are the most important differential diagnosis of parathyroid hormone (PTH)-dependent hypercalcemia. The clinical features of FHH and PHPT can overlap in some cases. Therefore, these two diseases must be differentiated to prevent unnecessary parathyroidectomy. Here, we present a case that was not entirely matched with any of the known differential diagnoses of hypercalcemia.

Case presentation

A 19-year-old girl with no history of any disease presented with persistent hypercalcemia without any specific musculoskeletal complaint. We found persistent hypercalcemia in her routine laboratory data from 3 years ago; while no data was available during the childhood period. Her dietary calcium intake was normal. She did not mention any history of renal stone, bone fracture as well as family history of hypercalcemia. Biochemical features showed normal values of serum creatinine, high normal serum calcium (range, 10.3–11.3 mg/dL; (normal range: 8.8–10.4)), and non-suppressed PTH levels (range, 37.2–58.1 pg/mL; (normal range: 10–65)). Serum 25 OH vitamin D level at the first visit was 16.1 ng/mL that treated by vitamin D supplementation. Since then, all 25 OH vitamin D levels were in the acceptable range. After correction of vitamin D deficiency during the follow-up period the calcium creatinine clearance ratio(s) (CCCR) were calculated in the range of 0.009 to 0.014 (means below 1%). The clinical and laboratory data indicate more FHH rather than PHPT. Genetic studies were negative for the common genes associated with FHH (CASR, GNA11, and AP2S1 genes) and multiple endocrine neoplasia type1 (MEN1). On the other hand, no evidence of autoimmunity was found in her to support an autoimmune FHH-like syndrome. Hence, the case did not match completely to any diagnosis of FHH and PHPT, so we decided to follow her.

Conclusion

We presented a patient with FHH phenotype whose common genetic tests were negative. Further research is needed to ascertain other causes leading to similar manifestations.

### Clinical review: rare causes of hypercalcemia [^114AsAaU]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2005). Low credibility.

Context

Although hypercalcemia is usually caused by primary hyperparathyroidism or malignancy, a number of other conditions can be important to consider. This review considers unusual causes of hypercalcemia that are generally not found in reviews on this subject.

Evidence Acquisition

Articles describing rarely reported associations between hypercalcemia and unusual causes were identified through a computer search of the terms hypercalcemia/etiology and through the references listed in those articles. We grouped the 58 different reports into categories defined by a presumed etiology: increased levels of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D or PTHrP, occult milk-alkali syndrome, and undefined mechanisms. Reports in infants and children are listed separately, as are reports of pseudohypercalcemia, situations that are not truly hypercalcemic because the ionized calcium is normal.

Evidence Synthesis

In some situations, as this review points out, a number of unusual causes of hypercalcemia are important to consider. The search for an elusive cause of hypercalcemia is best accomplished by the most likely potential mechanism. An orderly search in this manner is likely to reveal the underlying cause.

Conclusions

That so many patients have been described with rare and usually poorly understood causes of hypercalcemia highlights our incomplete understanding of calcium metabolism in humans and suggests additional areas in which directed clinical investigation might improve our knowledge of the normal metabolism of calcium.

### Hyperparathyroidism [^116PPaUD]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most frequent cause of hypercalcemia in ambulatory patients. The condition is most common in postmenopausal women, although it can occur in persons of all ages, including pregnant women. If symptoms are present, they are attributable to hypercalcemia and may include weakness, easy fatigability, anorexia, or anxiety. However, most persons have no symptoms, and primary hyperparathyroidism usually is diagnosed after an elevated serum calcium level is found incidentally on multiphasic chemistry panel testing. Persistent hypercalcemia and an elevated serum parathyroid hormone level are the diagnostic criteria for primary hyperparathyroidism. Other causes of hypercalcemia are rare, and usually are associated with low (or sometimes normal) parathyroid hormone levels. Malignancy is the most frequent cause of hypercalcemia in hospitalized patients. Parathyroidectomy is the definitive treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism. When performed by experienced endocrine surgeons, the procedure has success rates of 90 to 95 percent and a low rate of complications. Asymptomatic patients who decline surgery and meet criteria for medical management must commit to conscientious long-term monitoring. Any unexplained elevation of the serum calcium level should be evaluated promptly to prevent complications from hypercalcemia.

### Hypercalcemia in a renal transplant recipient suffering with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia [^111otWem]. American Journal of Kidney Diseases (2002). Low credibility.

Hypercalcemia occurs frequently after renal transplantation. Preexisting hyperparathyroidism is the most common cause of post-transplantation hypercalcemia. We describe a renal transplant recipient infected with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) who developed hypercalcemia, elevated 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and suppressed parathyroid hormone levels. This phenomenon mimics the extrarenal production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D by activated alveolar macrophages in granulomatous diseases with hypercalcemia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-mediated hypercalcemia caused by PCP in a renal transplant recipient. This entity should be included in the differential diagnosis for renal transplant recipients with hypercalcemia, especially in patients who develop lung infections.

### Persistent hypercalcemia with similar familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia features: a case report and literature review [^1158XTfV]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2021). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusion

We have described a young lady with persistent mild hypercalcemia, high normal PTH, CCCR ≤ 0.01, without any clinical findings of PHPT, and any related family history of hypercalcemia and nephrolithiasis. Genetic studies were negative for known FHH mutations and the MEN 1 gene. No evidence of the presence of autoimmune FHH like syndrome was detected.

FHH and PHPT are the two most important differential diagnoses in this patient. A two-step diagnostic procedure was used for distinguishing between FHH and PHPT. The first step was the CCCR from a 24-h urine sample. A ratio of less than 0.01 suggests FHH, and a ratio of 0.02 or higher could indicate PHPT. For the second step, all patients with a CCCR of 0.020 or less are tested for mutations in the CASR gene. The diagnostic sensitivity of these two steps is 98%. The majority (80%) of patients with FHH have a CCCR of < 0.01; nevertheless, almost 20% of patients with PHPT have a CCCR between 0.01 and 0.02 which can overlap with FHH individuals. A low CCCR may be seen in PHPT with renal insufficiency or in those with severe vitamin D deficiency; the patients have a slightly elevated or high normal serum calcium and a low urinary excretion of calcium, while our patient had low CCCR without renal failure and vitamin D deficiency. On the other hand, a large retrospective cohort study was done on 1000 patients with definitive diagnosis of PHPT based on surgery, which showed CCCR is valuable only in 37% patients to correctly differentiate FHH from mild PHPT. In 63% patients with surgically verified PHPT, CCCR was below 2% where both FHH and primary hyperparathyroidism are overlapping.

### A case of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia type 1 due to CASR p. Pro55Leu mutation [^116a2ZRt]. BMC Endocrine Disorders (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Hypercalcemia is a condition causing disorders in multiple organs, including bone, brain, and heart. The causes of hypercalcemia include hyperparathyroidism, cancer, tuberculosis, immobility, and inappropriate vitamin D supplementation. Among these, primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a relatively common disease (incidence rate;1 in 1,000) and often requires parathyroid gland resection. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) is a rare autosomal dominant disease (incidence rate; 1 in 78,000) that requires, in general, no treatment. Thus, differential diagnosis of FHH from PHPT is critical to avoid unnecessary surgery.

Urinary calcium excretion and calcium creatinine clearance ratio (CCCR) levels are widely used for differential diagnosis of FHH and PHPT; even so, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish the two diseases. Approximately 80% of FHH patients demonstrate urinary calcium excretion < 100 mg/day and CCCR < 0.01, while ~ 20% show CCCR 0.01–0.02. In contrast, PHPT patients usually have CCCR > 0.02, while ~ 20%, who have concomitant vitamin D deficiency show CCCR < 0.01. It is therefore difficult to distinguish FHH from PHPT based only on CCCR values. Thus, genetic testing becomes critical for the positive diagnosis of FHH.

To date, FHH-related mutations have been identified in genes related to the calcium sensing system that regulates calcium homeostasis. The calcium-sensing receptor, CASR, is encoded by the CASR gene and belongs to a G protein-coupled receptor family that regulates parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, vitamin D synthesis, and calcium absorption and resorption. G-protein α11 (GNA11) is encoded by the GNA11 gene and mediates CaSR signaling. Adaptor-related protein complex 2 (AP-2) is a membrane-associated heterotetramer complex and composed of two large chain, medium chain, and a small chain. The adaptor-related protein complex 2 sigma one subunit encoded by the AP2S1 gene binds to CASR and facilitates CaSR internalization. Loss of function mutations in the CASR, GNA11, or AP2S1 genes cause FHH type 1 (FHH1), FHH type 2 (FHH2), and FHH type 3 (FHH3), respectively. Approximately 60% of FHH patients have mutations in the CASR gene.

### Hypercalcemia in pregnancy [^116CyQxS]. Endocrinology and Metabolism Clinics of North America (2021). Medium credibility.

Hypercalcemic disorders are rare in pregnant women and are usually due to primary hyperparathyroidism. Clinical manifestations of hypercalcemia are nonspecific and can be masked by the physiologic changes of pregnancy. Furthermore, routine antenatal screening does not include serum calcium measurement and a hypercalcemia diagnosis may therefore be delayed until term or even after delivery. Timely recognition and appropriate interventions are essential to decrease maternal and fetal complications. Conservative measures are appropriate in the presence of mild hypercalcemia. Parathyroidectomy remains the mainstay of treatment for primary hyperparathyroidism with significant hypercalcemia not responding to conservative measures.

### Managing primary hyperparathyroidism in primary care [^114qisRa]. Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin (2010). Low credibility.

Patients with calcium concentrations above 3 mmol/L typically start to develop symptoms of hypercalcaemia, which can include nausea, vomiting, thirst and polyuria, malaise, confusion, lowered pain threshold and coma. Milder hypercalcaemia (calcium concentrations < 3 mmol/L) is often asymptomatic, and the problem is therefore usually discovered as an incidental finding on routine biochemical screening. Primary hyperparathyroidism is a common cause of hypercalcaemia. Here, we consider the recognition and further management of patients presenting with asymptomatic primary hyperparathyroidism in primary care.

### Severe hypercalcemia and a pelvic Brown tumor in an adolescent with primary hyperparathyroidism: a case report [^117CGV7Y]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion and conclusions

Hypercalcemia is a relatively rare presentation in the pediatric population, however, an approach to the differential diagnosis and awareness of initial management steps is important for the general pediatrician. While hypercalcemia in neonates and infants includes a number of genetic and iatrogenic possibilities, the diagnosis in the adolescent – much like in adults – is most commonly due to one of three aetiologies: hyperparathyroidism, malignancy or immobilization. Given the large palpable abdominal mass found in our patient, initial assessments were highly suspicious for an underlying malignancy. However, biochemical and radiologic evaluation confirmed the diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism and proved the abdominal mass to be due to constipation and fecal impaction secondary to severe hypercalcemia.

Initial management for all patients with severe symptomatic hypercalcemia must begin with IV fluid administration for dilution and subsequent renal excretion of excess calcium. Hypercalcemia can induce dehydration through impaired oral intake and is compounded by possible development of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Additional therapies to reduce serum calcium levels may include antiresorptive agents (i.e. bisphosphonates), calcitonin, forced calciuresis, and corticosteroids. Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclastic activity and hinder hydroxyapatite breakdown, a mineral composed of calcium and phosphate. Calcitonin inhibits bone resorption and forces renal excretion of calcium, but its effect is limited due to development of tachyphylaxis within days of initial exposure. Facilitating calciuresis through diuretic use, such as furosemide, should be delayed until intravascular volume has been replaced. The use of corticosteroids is potentially beneficial in select etiologies of hypercalcemia that are primarily mediated by excessive production of activated vitamin D (ex. granulomatous diseases).

This patient highlights several unique aspects to the presentation of hyperparathyroidism. Primary hyperparathyroidism is characterized by the excessive secretion of PTH by one or multiple parathyroid glands. PTH promotes bone catabolism of cortical bone and bone anabolism of cancellous bone. This was demonstrated here with a relative reduction in BMD of the distal 1/3 forearm – a primarily cortical site – and minimal impact on BMD of the lumbar spine – predominantly trabecular. Osteolytic lesions such as brown tumors manifest in severe and prolonged courses of hyperparathyroidism and excessive osteoclastic activity. Renal involvement from hyperparathyroidism is more frequent than bone involvement and manifests with hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, and nephrolithiasis. Neuropsychological symptoms are also associated with hypercalcemia and include nonspecific complaints such as weakness, fatigue, depression and anxiety as well as complaints of decreased memory and concentration, loss of initiative, irritability, and disturbed sleep.

Hypercalcaemia must be considered by calculation of adjusted calcium, and a careful history taken to assess dietary calcium intake and for the possibility of a malabsorption syndrome. 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) should be measured and replaced if indicated. The management plan for the patient is influenced by the context in which calcium and PTH were measured. In this brief review we describe the assessment of a patient with normocalcaemic hyperparathyroidism.

### Benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia [^111GMrJW]. Endocrine Practice (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pathophysiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and management options for benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia.

Methods

We present a systematic summary of benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia after review of the current available literature.

Results

Benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by lifelong hypercalcemia, relative hypocalciuria, and inappropriately elevated parathyroid hormone. It is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the calcium-sensing receptor gene (CASR). Benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is important clinically because it can be difficult to distinguish from primary hyperparathyroidism. It is a benign condition, and affected patients should be advised against parathyroidectomy. The incidence of complications associated with primary hyperparathyroidism, like osteopenia and nephrolithiasis, is not increased in persons with benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, and the rates are similar to those in the general population. Rarely, a severe form of this disease, namely neonatal severe primary hyperparathyroidism is seen in infants with homozygous CASR mutations.

Conclusions

Benign familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a small but important cause of hypercalcemia, especially in the younger population. Hypercalcemia persists after subtotal parathyroidectomy. It is important to diagnose this condition, not only in the index case but also in family members, because these patients should be advised against surgical intervention.

### Differentiating familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia from primary hyperparathyroidism [^116sN8Up]. Endocrine Practice (2013). Low credibility.

Objective

Because the clinical features of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) overlap significantly with those of primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), various means of differentiating between the two diseases have been suggested. Here we present a review of the clinical delineation of these two diseases.

Methods

Review of the English language literature on FHH and PHPT.

Results

FHH is a rare genetic disorder generally resulting in asymptomatic hypercalcemia of minimal clinical consequence. It is easily misdiagnosed as PHPT because both entities can manifest as hypercalcemia with an inappropriately normal or elevated level of parathyroid hormone. The 2 disorders differ in renal processing of calcium, and a number of indices of renal calcium excretion have been proposed to differentiate the 2 entities. However, the two disorders have considerable overlaps in their ranges on these indices making differentiation a challenge. There are many mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) gene associated with FHH and it is becoming increasingly recognized that the CaSR has broad functional variability.

Conclusion

The calcium:creatinine clearance ratio (CCCR) is the consensus biochemical test to differentiate between PHPT and FHH. However, this test is still limited by a considerable indeterminate range, and definitive diagnosis of FHH requires genetic testing. A combination of clinical suspicion, biochemical testing, and genetic analysis is required to differentiate PHPT from FHH and thus spare patients with FHH from nontherapeutic operative treatment.

Research considerations — evidence gaps for hypercalcemia of malignancy (HCM): Head to head RCTs of IV BPs vs Dmab are needed to assess clinically important outcomes for this intervention, including clinical improvement. Because of the rarity of this condition, RCTs may require global collaboration. Assessing appropriate glucocorticoid dosing and duration in this population and determining continued glucocorticoid need if antiresorptive therapy is administered are needed. Significant gaps in research exist regarding complementary evidence for the treatment of HCM, including health services delivery, costs/cost-effectiveness of treatment, patients' values and preferences, equity, acceptability, and feasibility.

### A case of hypercalcemia from Pneumocystis jirovecii in an immunosuppressed non-HIV patient [^116oToEh]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

PJP pneumonia is a life-threatening infection mainly among immunocompromised hosts. The prevalence of non-HIV related PJP is increasing with emerging immunosuppressive therapies for chronic illnesses. PJP infection outside of the HIV setting often presents with greater severity (i.e. abrupt respiratory failure) and carries an all-cause mortality of up to 30%, which is more severe compared to PJP infection in patients with HIV. Diagnosis of PJP in this setting may be elusive given the often indolent presentation. Hypercalcemia is not classically associated with PJP infection; however, there have been several case reports in the literature of PJP occurring in kidney and liver transplant recipients. We report a novel case of PJP in a non-transplant recipient, on rituximab, preceded by hypercalcemia in addition to the classic respiratory symptoms. This case addresses a knowledge gap whereby clinicians should consider PJP infections on the differential for patients presenting with hypercalcemia, in the appropriate setting.

### Altered mental status and hematemesis in a child with hypercalcemia [^117UHrGg]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2012). Low credibility.

Altered mental status in a child is a potentially life-threatening condition with a broad differential including vascular, toxin-mediated, infectious, metabolic, and traumatic causes. Hypercalcemia is a rare cause of altered mental status in children. We report a case of a 13-month-old boy with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia who presented to our emergency department with altered mental status and hematemesis. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a rare cause of hypercalcemia that usually presents with asymptomatic hypercalcemia. This case illustrates the presentation of severe hypercalcemia and reviews the initial management and evaluation of hypercalcemia in children.

### Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome due to vitamin D toxicity [^111JjeJj]. Pediatrics (2024). Medium credibility.

Although toxicity from excessive exogenous vitamin D supplementation is rare, a range of symptoms can occur, most of which result from hypercalcemia. We report a novel case of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) in a young child who required intensive care after presenting with hypercalcemia, hypertensive emergency, acute kidney injury, and hypercarbic respiratory failure, which ultimately were attributed to vitamin D toxicity (VDT). We report a young child who developed PRES in association with VDT. Our report informs pediatric outpatient, hospitalist, and intensivist providers about rare but life-threatening complications from hypervitaminosis D, adds VDT to the differential diagnosis for children with similar presentations, and highlights the importance of vitamin supplementation safety guidance for families.

### A case of severe 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D-mediated hypercalcemia due to a granulomatous disorder [^112EbMnE]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2012). Low credibility.

Background

Profound hypercalcemia is usually due to underlying malignancy.

Case

We describe a case of granulomatous myositis presenting with extreme hypercalcemia of 20.1 mg/dl and generalized weakness that did not resolve despite rapid correction of serum calcium. The disease process was unmasked by cholecalciferol supplementation. Initial search for a malignant process yielded no diagnosis, but an elevated 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D level, in the setting of a suppressed PTH and undetectable PTHrP, pointed to the presence of excessive 1α-hydroxylase activity.

Methods and Results

Biopsy of the vastus lateralis muscle showed extensive granulomatous myositis. Immunohistochemical staining for 1α-hydroxylase was localized to the multinucleated giant cells and histiocytes. Musculoskeletal magnetic resonance imaging showed involvement of proximal muscle groups of both thighs and upper limbs.

Conclusion

Measurement of vitamin D metabolites is pivotal in diagnosing 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-mediated hypercalcemia. Granulomatous disease can occasionally cause profound hypercalcemia and needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D-mediated hypercalcemia is responsive to glucocorticoid therapy.

### Diagnosis and detection of sarcoidosis. An official American Thoracic Society clinical practice guideline [^112KNAU1]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

Patients who require calcium repletion are at risk for hypercalciuria and/or hypercalcemia, and need to be monitored closely, because the effects of calcium and vitamin D supplementation are complex. Studies have reported a small, but significant, increase in hypercalcemia with calcium and vitamin D supplementation, with another finding that withdrawal of calcium and vitamin D supplementation improved the hypercalcemia. Whereas hypercalcemia caused by vitamin D supplementation did not cause sustained renal damage, vitamin D supplementation was shown to be ineffective in terms of improved bone health or other benefits. The committee had no basis to recommend routine vitamin D screening but did recommend that both types of vitamin D testing (1,25-[OH] 2 and 25-[OH] vitamin D) be undertaken in patients who are being evaluated for possible vitamin D replacement.

Recommendations

1 For patients with sarcoidosis who do not have symptoms or signs of hypercalcemia, we recommend baseline serum calcium testing to screen for abnormal calcium metabolism (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence).
2 If assessment of vitamin D metabolism is deemed necessary in a patient with sarcoidosis, such as to determine if vitamin D replacement is indicated, we suggest measuring both 25- and 1,25-OH vitamin D levels before vitamin D replacement (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence).

Research needs

Although the cause of abnormal calcium metabolism, hypercalcemia, and hypercalciuria appears to be multifactorial, better delineation of the mechanisms, such as genetic variation, may help define better screening tests and/or ways to treat this manifestation of sarcoidosis. The question of whether 24-hour urine calcium or other biomarkers are better assessments of abnormal calcium metabolism than serum calcium or vitamin D testing needs to be evaluated. The potential benefits of calcium and vitamin D supplementation on bone health and/or the potential antiinflammatory effects of vitamin D supplementation need to be weighed against the risk of hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria, and the role of monitoring of vitamin D metabolism after vitamin D supplementation also needs to be further established. Finally, whether low 25-(OH) vitamin D or elevated 1,25-(OH) 2 vitamin D levels are biomarkers for disease severity and/or granulomatous burden needs to be determined.

Question 7: Should Patients with Sarcoidosis Undergo Screening for Hematological Abnormalities by Routine Complete Blood Cell Count Testing?

### The differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia… [^112XU7Nh]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

THE PROCESS of diagnosing primary hyperparathyroidism has been one of exclusion of the other causes of hypercalcemia. In the past decade, since the measurement of parathyroid hormone by radioimmunoassay became available through commercial laboratories, its use has grown rapidly. Theoretically, PTH levels should be elevated in primary hyperparathyroidism and possibly in malignancies producing PTH ectopically; in the other causes of hypercalcemia, the levels should be decreased. 1, 2 The number of PTH assays ordered at this hospital has reached 350 per year, whereas during the period of 1970 to 1978 the number of new cases of primary hyperparathyroidism was less than ten per year. This suggested that many physicians were ordering PTH measurements early, if not even first, in the evaluation of hypercalcemia, the expectation being that PTH determinations would separate primary hyperparathyroidism from the other causes of hypercalcemia.

In adults with severe HCM, combination therapy with calcitonin and an IV BP or Dmab is suggested. For refractory or recurrent HCM despite treatment with IV BP, Dmab is suggested. dysfunction, kidney failure, and arrhythmias with rapidly rising calcium levels or severe hypercalcemia. 1 Pathophysiology followed by HCM can include production of parathyroid hormone–related peptides, bone metastases releasing osteoclast activating factors, and excess production of calcitriol. 2 Treatment of HCM begins with intravenous hydration, potent antiresorptive agents, and calcitonin for severe hypercalcemia. The guidelines committee suggested that Dmab is associated with greater suppression of bone turnover compared with ZA.

In an RCT of women with breast cancer, skeletal metastases, and albumin-adjusted serum calcium levels of 8. 0 mg/dL to
11. 5 mg/dL, ZA had lower HCM incidence compared with placebo.
9. For patients with severe HCM, a conditional recommendation for combination therapy with calcitonin and IV BP or Dmab was suggested based on evidence from 1 study that showed that SCa levels at 24, 48, and 72 hours were similar with BP-only treatment and combination BP and calcitonin therapy despite higher initial SCa levels in the combination group, suggesting synergy. There were no differences in rates of HCM resolution or hypocalcemia, although mortality was lower in the BP-only group, which may reflect higher severity of underlying disease in the combination group.
10. Treatment with IV BP and Dmab can lower SCa levels within days and provide durable calcium-lowering effects. Both agents carry the small but significant risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical femoral fractures.

Treatment with IV BPs is associated with kidney failure, acute phase reactions, and hypocalcemia. While Dmab is safe for those with kidney insufficiency, higher rates of hypocalcemia have been observed. Additionally, Dmab carries the risk of rebound bone loss and fractures with discontinuation. 3.

3 to the active form, 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 which, in turn, stimulates gastrointestinal absorption of calcium. Low circulating concentrations of calcium stimulate PTH secretion, and high circulating concentrations of calcium depress PTH secretion. PTH is metabolized rapidly in the liver and kidneys; its circulating half-life is approximately two to five minutes.
5. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is caused by a single mutation in the calcium-sensing receptor, resulting in insensitivity to feedback inhibition of PTH secretion. In affected patients, the calcium/creatinine clearance ratio is less than 0. 01, compared with a calcium/creatinine clearance ratio of greater than
0. 02 in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Patients with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia are asymptomatic and require no treatment. 1, 6, 8 Familial isolated hyperparathyroidism has no specific features.

It is usually thought to be an expression of occult multiple endocrine neoplasia type I.
6. Hypercalcemia should be confirmed by repeated measurements of serum calcium concentrations, because all patients with primary hyperparathyroidism do not have demonstrable hypercalcemia every time the serum calcium level is measured. 1, 11 Preferably, tests should be performed with the patient fasting and with minimal venous occlusion. Use of thiazide diuretics should be discontinued two weeks before a serum calcium level measurement is repeated. All serum calcium concentrations should be "corrected" to the prevailing serum albumin concentration. The total calcium level can be corrected for low albumin levels by adding 0. 8 mg per dL to the total serum calcium level for every

1. 0 g per dL by which the serum albumin concentration is lower than 4 g per dL.

|Asymptomatic| There are no clinical factors that predict the prognosis of patients with asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism. 9, 23 Studies have demonstrated that up to 25 percent of asymptomatic patients develop indications for surgery during medical observation. 1 Factors that can exacerbate hypercalcemia should be avoided and treated accordingly. Recommendations include modest intake of calcium and vitamin D. Theoretically, low calcium intake could stimulate PTH production. 1, 13.
