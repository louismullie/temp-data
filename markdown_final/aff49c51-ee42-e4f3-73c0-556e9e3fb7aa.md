## Question

Cystic hygroma

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about cystic hygroma. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about defining cystic hygroma and its pathophysiology. Then, I should verify epidemiology and prenatal detection. Next, I will examine etiologies, especially chromosomal and genetic associations. After that, I need to review prenatal diagnostic strategies and prognostic modifiers. Then, I will consider postnatal management, including surgical and non-surgical options. Finally, I should synthesize counseling points and highlight controversies and gaps in evidence, making sure I double-check key figures and cite appropriately throughout.

> Let me first confirm the definition and embryology. Cystic hygroma is a macrocystic lymphatic malformation arising from failure of primitive lymphatic channels to connect with the venous system, typically presenting as multiloculated, fluid-filled cavities in the nuchal region, and it is distinct from simple increased nuchal translucency in both morphology and prognosis [^1e5faf82] [^b1039fe1].

> I need to check epidemiology and detection. Prenatal prevalence estimates vary, with cohorts suggesting roughly 1 in 285 to 1 in 1775 pregnancies, and first-trimester detection is common in screening programs; importantly, cystic hygroma is one of the strongest ultrasound markers for fetal aneuploidy, which materially shifts pretest probabilities and counseling [^d1b30aea] [^cbeaae05] [^b1039fe1].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about etiology without anchoring to high-quality data. I should confirm chromosomal risks first: across meta-analyses and large cohorts, about 50–55% of cystic hygromas harbor chromosomal abnormalities, with Turner syndrome most frequent, followed by trisomy 21, trisomy 18, and trisomy 13; this is consistent with ACOG guidance and supports offering diagnostic testing when cystic hygroma is identified [^cc291cc1] [^b1039fe1] [^1c629039].

> Wait, let me verify monogenic contributors and syndromic associations. Noonan syndrome and other RASopathies are well-described causes of cystic hygroma with normal karyotype, and emerging data show that exome sequencing can identify pathogenic variants in a meaningful subset of cases, particularly when structural anomalies accompany the hygroma; yield is lower in isolated cystic hygroma, but not negligible, so I should tailor testing to phenotype and parental preferences [^eaaa8ed0] [^52300dcc] [^8aaf8cfe].

> I should double-check prognostic modifiers. Septations, increased nuchal translucency thickness, hydrops fetalis, and additional structural anomalies worsen outcomes, whereas early detection before 45 mm crown–rump length and spontaneous resolution in the second trimester portend better outcomes; NIPT results also modify residual risk, with low-risk NIPT still leaving a notable residual aneuploidy risk that warrants careful counseling [^141f919a] [^98f6d76b] [^b27d2563].

> Next, I should review prenatal diagnostic strategy. ACOG recommends genetic counseling, offering diagnostic testing with karyotype and microarray, and comprehensive ultrasound at 18–22 weeks including fetal echocardiography; I initially thought WES would be first-line, but wait, I should correct that — WES is best reserved for cases with normal CMA plus additional anomalies or when targeted panels are unrevealing, given modest incremental yield in isolated cystic hygroma [^1c629039] [^b1039fe1] [^3a7aa3d1].

> Let me consider delivery planning and peripartum management. For large cervicofacial lesions threatening the airway, EXIT or other advanced airway strategies may be indicated; MRI can help delineate extent and plan interventions, and coordination with pediatric surgery and neonatology is essential to mitigate morbidity [^4b49d0e9] [^f73a335d].

> I will now examine postnatal management. Surgery remains a mainstay for localized, accessible lesions, but recurrence is common, especially in suprahyoid cervicofacial disease where recurrence can exceed 80%; sclerotherapy with agents like OK-432, doxycycline, or bleomycin achieves meaningful reduction or cure in many macrocystic lesions, though complications such as swelling, infection, and fibrosis can occur [^f74f28dc] [^272f5eeb] [^5f8ea5ec].

> But wait, what if the lesion is extensive or refractory? I should review systemic therapy. Sirolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, has emerging evidence for reducing lymphatic proliferation and can be combined with sclerotherapy and debulking in complex cases; however, I need to ensure therapeutic drug monitoring and awareness of immunosuppression risks, and I should note that most data are from case series rather than randomized trials [^33ce8ac8] [^5970f79b].

> Hold on, I should verify the role of observation. Spontaneous resolution or dramatic reduction does occur, particularly in nonseptated or transient lesions, and some series document improvement or resolution even without intervention; thus, a subset may be managed conservatively with close follow-up, especially if the lesion is small, asymptomatic, and not progressing [^ca760954] [^bcb54629].

> Let me synthesize counseling points. Parents should be counseled that cystic hygroma carries a high likelihood of chromosomal abnormality, substantial risks of structural anomalies even with normal karyotype, and nontrivial rates of perinatal loss; however, early detection, absence of septations, normal detailed anatomy, and spontaneous resolution improve the chances of a normal outcome, and prenatal exome can uncover monogenic causes when anomalies are present [^cc291cc1] [^b27d2563] [^52300dcc].

> I should confirm recurrence risk and future pregnancy planning. When a genetic etiology is identified, recurrence follows standard Mendelian risks; in idiopathic cases, empiric recurrence is low but not zero, and preconception or early prenatal counseling with consideration of first-trimester ultrasound and diagnostic testing is prudent, particularly if there is a family history or consanguinity [^notfound].

> Finally, I need to highlight controversies and evidence gaps. The optimal timing and sequencing of genetic testing, the true incremental value of prenatal exome in isolated cystic hygroma, and the long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes of sirolimus-exposed infants remain uncertain; multidisciplinary care and shared decision-making are essential while we await higher-quality comparative studies and consensus guidelines [^3a7aa3d1] [^33ce8ac8].

Cystic hygroma is a **congenital lymphatic malformation** most often in the neck, presenting as a multiloculated, fluid-filled mass with thin septations [^1e5faf82]. It is strongly associated with chromosomal anomalies (notably Turner, trisomy 21, trisomy 18) and major structural defects, especially when detected in the first trimester [^cc291cc1] [^d1b30aea]. Management is **multidisciplinary**, with prenatal genetic counseling, detailed ultrasound, and fetal echocardiography; postnatal options include observation, sclerotherapy, or surgery, with sirolimus considered for refractory cases [^1c629039] [^33ce8ac8]. Prognosis depends on karyotype, presence of hydrops, and lesion size/location; isolated, non-septated lesions have better outcomes, whereas septated or syndromic cases carry high risks of aneuploidy, fetal loss, and neonatal complications [^b27d2563] [^d1b30aea].

---

## Pathophysiology and embryology

Cystic hygroma arises from **failed connection of lymphatic sacs to the venous system**, causing lymphatic dilation and cyst formation [^1e5faf82]. It is a **macrocystic lymphatic malformation** with multiloculated, fluid-filled spaces lined by endothelium and separated by thin septa [^1e5faf82].

---

## Clinical presentation

- **Prenatal**: Most often detected on first-trimester ultrasound as a septated nuchal mass; may extend to axilla, mediastinum, or trunk [^1c629039] [^1e5faf82].
- **Postnatal**: Presents as a soft, compressible, translucent mass in the neck or axilla; may enlarge with infection or hemorrhage, causing airway or feeding compromise [^f74f28dc].
- **Associated features**: Webbed neck, lymphedema, hydrops fetalis, pleural effusions, and other structural anomalies depending on underlying syndrome [^feb98c6e].

---

## Diagnostic evaluation

### Prenatal diagnosis

- **Ultrasound**: First-line; identifies septated cystic mass, extent, and associated anomalies [^1c629039].
- **MRI**: Clarifies extent, airway involvement, and surgical planning, especially for large or complex lesions [^4b49d0e9].
- **Genetic testing**: Karyotype, microarray, and targeted panels for Turner, Noonan, and other syndromes; exome sequencing if microarray is normal but anomalies persist [^1c629039] [^52300dcc].

---

### Postnatal diagnosis

Postnatal diagnosis relies on **ultrasound** to confirm cystic nature and extent, while **MRI** defines deep involvement and relationships to vital structures. Histopathology shows dilated lymphatic channels with endothelial lining and septations [^20b3c7b4].

---

## Associated genetic and structural anomalies

| **Category** | **Examples** |
|-|-|
| Chromosomal anomalies | - Turner syndrome (45, X) <br/> - Trisomy 21 <br/> - Trisomy 18 <br/> - Trisomy 13 [^cc291cc1] [^d1b30aea] |
| Monogenic disorders | - Noonan syndrome (PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, LZTR1) <br/> - Roberts syndrome (ESCO2) <br/> - Multiple pterygium syndromes [^eaaa8ed0] [^e48a188f] |
| Structural anomalies | - Congenital heart disease <br/> - Skeletal dysplasias <br/> - Renal anomalies <br/> - Facial clefts [^cc291cc1] [^d1b30aea] |

---

## Management strategies

### Prenatal management

Prenatal management includes **genetic counseling** with diagnostic testing and detailed ultrasound, including fetal echocardiography [^1c629039]. Multidisciplinary care coordinates obstetrics, genetics, pediatric surgery, and neonatology. Delivery planning may involve EXIT or Cesarean if airway compromise is anticipated [^4b49d0e9].

---

### Postnatal management

- **Observation**: Small, asymptomatic lesions may regress spontaneously [^ca760954].
- **Sclerotherapy**: First-line for macrocystic lesions; agents include OK-432, doxycycline, or bleomycin [^272f5eeb].
- **Surgery**: Reserved for refractory, symptomatic, or cosmetically significant lesions; recurrence is common if excision is incomplete [^f74f28dc].
- **Sirolimus**: mTOR inhibitor for refractory or complex lymphatic malformations; monitor drug levels and immune suppression [^33ce8ac8].

---

## Prognosis

Prognosis varies with **karyotype**, lesion characteristics, and associated anomalies. Isolated, non-septated lesions have a **favorable outlook**, whereas septated lesions or those with hydrops carry high risks of aneuploidy, fetal loss, and neonatal complications [^b27d2563] [^d1b30aea]. Long-term outcomes depend on the underlying syndrome and the success of interventions.

---

## Recent advances and controversies

Recent advances include **prenatal exome sequencing** to detect monogenic causes when microarray is normal, and **sirolimus** as a targeted therapy for refractory cases [^52300dcc] [^33ce8ac8]. Controversies remain regarding the optimal timing of surgery, the role of sirolimus as first-line therapy, and the ethical implications of prenatal diagnosis in severe syndromes.

---

Cystic hygroma is a **lymphatic malformation** with significant associations to chromosomal and structural anomalies. Management is **multidisciplinary**, with prognosis dictated by karyotype, lesion features, and associated anomalies.

### Roberts syndrome with cystic hygroma: a rare clinical presentation of a rare syndrome [^b8e1f816]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

In conclusion, Roberts syndrome is a rare disorder that can be diagnosed clinically and genetically. It is associated with a high rate of mortality and poor quality of life for survivors. Management requires a comprehensive approach from multiple specialities to improve their well-being. Although cystic hygroma is a rare feature of this syndrome, its presence further worsens the prognosis of Roberts syndrome and should lead to an earlier proposal for medical termination of pregnancy.

Learning points

Roberts syndrome is a rare genetic disorder with multiple organ affections. This case describes an association of cystic hygroma with Roberts syndrome.
The diagnosis of Roberts syndrome is suspected or presumed based on phenotypic features; however, the gold standard for diagnosis is by cytogenetics. The ESCO2 gene mutation is the recognised gene for the disorder.
This case highlights the importance of early prenatal diagnosis, genetic counselling and a multidisciplinary approach to managing such a rare syndrome. Despite that, it has a high mortality rate and a poor prognosis for the survivors.

### High angiogenic activity in cells isolated from cystic hygroma (...) [^20b3c7b4]. JAMA Network (1999). Excellent credibility.

Results Cells isolated from cystic hygroma are angiogenic in vitro and this angiogenic activity is due to secretion of high levels of angiogenic inducer, basic fibroblast growth factor, and lower levels of naturally occurring angiogenic inhibitor, thrombospondin-1. Conclusions Cystic hygromas may represent another neoplasm dependent on angiogenesis. The angiogenic activity is due in part to elevated levels of potent angiogenic inducer, basic fibroblast growth factor. Anti-angiogenic therapy directed at the endothelial cell may help suppress the growth of cystic hygromas. CYSTIC HYGROMAS are benign, locally aggressive lesions that can be difficult to manage because of recurrence following surgery and the limited efficacy and high toxicity associated with current pharmacological interventions. 1-5 Cystic hygromas are characterized histologically by a proliferation of blood vessels and lymphatics with intervening fibrous tissue and lymphoid aggregates.

Tumor growth and progression is favored when angiogenic proteins such as basic fibroblast growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor predominate locally or systemically. 7-9 We postulated that the growth of cystic hygromas results from the dysregulation of angiogenesis secondary to proteins secreted by cells derived from this lesion that help promote neovascularization and tumor progression. On physical examination, the mass appeared cystic and measured 8 × 10 cm. Results of evaluation with a computed tomographic scan evaluation were consistent with cystic hygroma and surgical excision was recommended. Surgery was performed; the mass was identified at the posterior triangle of the neck and was excised without incident. The specimen was delivered for surgical pathologic examination for further analysis, and the diagnosis of cystic hygroma was confirmed. Histological sections of the tumor revealed a proliferation of lymphatics, arterioles, and loose fibrous tissue.

Small aggregates of lymphocytes were present in the interstitial fibrous matrix. This study demonstrates that media conditioned by tumor cells cultured from a large cystic hygroma have high angiogenic activity. Most, but not all, of the activity can be attributed to bFGF. The cells also secreted an angiogenic inhibitor, TSP-1, although not in adequate quantities to block the angiogenic activity.

### A unique case of the rapid onset of a large cystic hygroma in the adult [^f104805a]. American Journal of Otolaryngology (2001). Low credibility.

Cystic hygroma is an uncommon lymphatic tumor seen rarely in adults, with less than 100 cases reported in the literature. The etiology and pathophysiology of this lesion is still in question. The majority of cystic hygromas occur in the head and neck, particularly in the posterior triangle. Although cystic hygromas tend to enlarge progressively over a span of weeks or months, relatively rapid enlargement over a span of days has been described. We present the unique case of an adult woman who experienced sudden onset of a large cystic hygroma in the neck without history of antecedent swelling, infection, or trauma. Successful surgical removal of the hygroma was performed. A brief review of the literature is presented.

### Cystic hygroma / lymphangioma: a rational approach to management [^ca760954]. The Laryngoscope (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To outline a rational approach to the management of cystic hygroma based on the authors' experience, the natural history of the disease, and the results of surgical treatment.

Study Design and Methods

A retrospective review of all patients with the diagnosis of lymphangioma or cystic hygroma from 1958 to 2000 was performed.

Results

Seventy-four patients were identified with 46 cases confined to the cervicofacial region. Surgical excision was performed on 60 of the 74 cases involving all regions of the body and 34 of the 46 patients with head and neck lesions. The location of the malformation is the most important determinate for surgical success. While surgical excision was the main treatment modality, 11 of 12 untreated patients were noted to improve, with 8 patients showing complete resolution.

Conclusions

In the treatment of lymphangiomas, the physician should be experienced in the management of such lesions, be aware of spontaneous resolution, and recognize the limitations and potential harm of surgery in certain instances.

### Hygroma in a 23-year-old man [^97825819]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

We describe a 23-year-old man with a cystic hygroma on the right side of his lower neck. Cystic hygromas are uncommon congenital lesions of the lymphatic system and are often diagnosed before the age of 2. The finding of a cystic hygroma is rare in adults. We report the results regarding a cystic hygroma in a 23-year-old man. An initial physical examination was performed, followed by an ultrasound examination and CT. Surgical excision was the treatment of choice. Adequate imaging and physical examination of lateral neck masses in adults are needed to confirm the diagnosis.

### Roberts syndrome with cystic hygroma: a rare clinical presentation of a rare syndrome [^bb15d8fe]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Figure 1 
Various prenatal ultrasound images showing anatomical abnormalities with a large cystic hygroma. (A) Viable pregnancy with a huge cystic hygroma with septation. (B) Axial view of the fetal head in the transthalamic plane, showing multiseptated cervicoccipital cyst. (C) Polyhydramnios. (D) The image shows fetal foot suspension of bilateral clubfeet. (E) Longitudinal view of fetal spine shows hemivertebra. (F) Axial view of the fetal head shows cystic hygroma with multiple thin septations.

The mother was initially planned by the obstetric team for vaginal delivery based on her previous two vaginal deliveries. At the gestational age of 34 weeks, the baby was delivered by elective lower-segment caesarean section due to severe polyhydramnios, non-immune hydrops and huge cystic hygroma. The baby was non-vigorous, with a heart rate of <100 beats per minute and no spontaneous breathing. The baby was declared dead at the age of 30 min. The diagnosis of Roberts syndrome was highly suspected by clinical features. A clinical examination revealed a hydrops fetalis, large cystic hygroma, hypertelorism, beaked nose, premaxillary protrusion, ear malformations, micrognathia, fused neck, bilateral tetra-phocomelia, thumb aplasia, syndactyly, elbow and knee flexion contractures, and fused genitalia. Figures2 4 show the anterior, lateral and posterior views of the baby, respectively. Skeletal survey showed kyphoscoliosis of the lumbosacral spine and bilateral upper limb deformities with excess soft tissue in the neck, as shown in figure 5. The parents declined autopsy and testing for the specific gene for Roberts syndrome for both the baby and parents due to its high cost.

### Cervicofacial cystic hygroma (...) [^f74f28dc]. JAMA Network (2025). Excellent credibility.

• Cystic hygromas usually present in infancy or early childhood as compressible masses that may rapidly and intermittently enlarge. While they may arise in any anatomic location, hygromas of the head and neck are especially difficult to manage since enlargement may cause serious sequela such as airway obstruction, feeding difficulties, and speech pathology. Complete extirpation of these lesions is often impossible, and recurrence rates are accordingly high. We reviewed our 10-year experience in treating cervicofacial cystic hygromas. Of 34 patients, 21 had lesions cephalad to the hyoid and 13 had lesions caudal to the hyoid. While none of the 13 children with infrahyoid lesions demonstrated feeding or respiratory difficulties, eight of 21 children with suprahyoid involvement presented with dysphagia or airway compromise. The recurrence rates for infrahyoid and suprahyoid lesions were 15% and 81%, respectively.

Those children with suprahyoid hygromas also experienced an increased operative complication rate compared with patients with infrahyoid involvement. Principles of management for suprahyoid and infrahyoid lesions are described, including the specific management of lingual, submandibular, parotid, and parotofacial hygromas. .

### Roberts syndrome with cystic hygroma: a rare clinical presentation of a rare syndrome [^ebba76cd]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Description

We had an opportunity to witness this rare case in the Women’s Wellness and Research Center, Qatar. The mother is in her late ‘20 s’, gravida 3 para 2, with a history of previous vaginal deliveries and no significant medical conditions. She conceived spontaneously after a consanguineous marriage of second-degree consanguinity. Her previous two siblings are normal. Her family history is positive for congenital anomalies and intrauterine fetal demise.

Her 13 week scan showed a nuchal translucency (NT) measurement of 2.7 mm with cystic hygroma. A detailed fetal anatomy scan in the fetomaternal unit revealed multiple congenital anomalies, including non-immune hydrops fetalis, a large cystic hygroma with generalised skin oedema, bilateral pleural effusions, small lung volume with possible lung hypoplasia, kyphoscoliosis, possible sacral agenesis and polyhydramnios figure 1. Amniocentesis was performed, yielding a normal karyotype and microarray result. A multidisciplinary team, including specialists from genetics, fetal medicine, obstetrics and neonatology, was involved in the antenatal care and counselled the parents regarding the poor prognosis and the possibility of intrauterine demise.

### OK-432 sclerotherapy of giant cervicomediastinal cystic hygroma [^5f8ea5ec]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Cystic hygroma is one type of the benign malformations and typically located in the neck, clavicle, and others, in children under the age of 5 years. However, the incidence of giant cervicomediastinal giant cystic hygroma is very rare, especially in adulthood. Such a location and age make its diagnosis difficult because they are usually asymptomatic. Complete surgical resection seems impossible while multiple sites are involved. Herein, we present a case of giant cervicomediastinal cystic hygroma, describing the clinical presentation, radiographic features, and OK-432 sclerotherapy. In conclusion, repeated OK-432 sclerotherapy may be an effective treatment option in giant cervicomediastinal cystic hygroma. Pay close attention to patient's symptoms and vital signs, adjusting the OK-432 dose throughout the process.

### Non-surgical treatment of a relapsed cystic hygroma in an adult [^2211c1f7]. BMJ Case Reports (2017). Medium credibility.

Lymphatic malformations, also known as lymphangiomas or cystic hygromas, are benign masses that typically affect newborns and infants and involve the head and neck regions. They are, however, rare in adults and even rarer in the axillary region. Although surgery is considered to be the treatment of choice, we present a rare case of a recurrent cystic hygroma 32 years after the first surgical operation. Due to the cosmetic concerns and the risks of a surgical approach, non-surgical therapy with percutaneous sclerosants was performed, with a good outcome after a 2-year follow-up period.

### A giant cystic hygroma on the leg of a newborn infant complicated by hyponatremia [^bb562023]. The Journal of Dermatology (2003). Low credibility.

Cystic hygromas are large cystic masses resulting from failure of lymph drainage. The vast majority occur in the neck or axilla. Cases of cystic hygroma of the extremity are extremely rare. We present a newborn infant with a giant cystic hygroma on her left leg, complicated by severe hyponatremia.

### Cystic hygroma of the neck: association with a growing venous aneurysm [^576d09b9]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2003). Low credibility.

Venous anomalies are rarely seen with cystic hygromas. We describe an unusual case of cystic hygroma of the neck associated with a saccular venous aneurysm that was increasing in size. A multi-modality examination of the neck-including CT, Doppler sonography, and MR imaging-revealed multiloculated cystic lesions bilaterally with predominance on the left side. A saccular venous aneurysm was noted within one of the sacs. Comparison with previous CT images showed that the aneurysm enlarged from 0.8 x 0.5 x 1.5 cm to 3.0 x 1.3 x 2.1 cm over 2 years. Identification of these malformations before surgery is critical.

### Congenital cystic neck masses: embryology and imaging appearances, with clinicopathological correlation [^fb0a7d19]. Current Problems in Diagnostic Radiology (2014). Low credibility.

Congenital cystic masses of the neck are uncommon and can present in any age group. Diagnosis of these lesions can be sometimes challenging. Many of these have characteristic locations and imaging findings. The most common of all congenital cystic neck masses is the thyroglossal duct cyst. The other congenital cystic neck masses are branchial cleft cyst, cystic hygroma (lymphangioma), cervical thymic and bronchogenic cysts, and the floor of the mouth lesions including dermoid and epidermoid cysts. In this review, we illustrate the common congenital cystic neck masses including embryology, clinical findings, imaging features, and histopathological findings.

### Rare case of cystic hygroma in the epidural space resulting in multilevel spinal cord compression [^5fe4bf11]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Lymphangioma, or cystic hygroma, involving the epidural space and spinal soft tissue, is a rare benign lesion consisting of an abnormal collection of lymphatic tissue isolated from the normal lymphatic system. This case report is the most extensive case of cystic hygroma involving the spine reported in the literature. A 23-year-old man with a history of cystic hygromas of the neck and thorax presented with bilateral upper and lower extremity weakness that progressively worsened over 3months. A left hemilaminectomy from C4 to T5 with endoscopic exploration and cyst drainage was performed. At last follow-up, the patient was ambulating and returned to work. Aggressive decompression of mass lesions resulting in myelopathy, such as the spinal cystic hygromas, resulted in improved motor function as well as overall function status.

### Management of cystic hygromas: 30 year experience [^a4f22c1f]. The Journal of Craniofacial Surgery (2006). Low credibility.

Cystic hygroma is a rare congenital malformation of the lymphatic system. In most centers, surgical excision is considered to be the optimal mode of treatment. Spontaneous resolution of cystic hygroma was briefly described in the literature with unsatisfactory results. Between 1970 and 2003, 14 patients were diagnosed to have cystic hygroma (13 cervical and 1 axillary). A retrospective review was performed. All patients were treated successfully with aspiration alone with a mean follow-up time of 5.75 years. Three patients needed multiple aspirations (average 1.66) with complete resolution. Complications were limited to one case of infection treated with antibiotics with no residual problems. Conservative management of cystic hygroma is a reliable mode of treatment with a low complication rate. Intralesional sclerosant injection and surgery should be reserved for other forms of lymphatic malformations.

### Early prenatal diagnosis of causative homozygous variants in ASCC1 in a fetus with cystic hygroma and additional homozygous variants of unknown significance associated with a neurological phenotype not visible in early gestation: dual diagnosis or not? [^14872754]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2024). Medium credibility.

A consanguineous couple was referred at 10 weeks of gestation (WG) for prenatal genetic investigations due to isolated cystic hygroma. Prenatal trio exome sequencing identified causative homozygous truncating variants in ASCC1 previously implicated in spinal muscular atrophy with congenital bone fractures. Prenatal manifestations in ASCC1 can usually include hydramnios, fetal hypo-/akinesia, arthrogryposis, contractures and limb deformities, hydrops fetalis and cystic hygroma. An additional truncating variant was identified in CSPP1 associated with Joubert syndrome. Presentations in CSPP1 include cerebellar and brainstem malformations with vermis hypoplasia and molar tooth sign, difficult to visualize in early gestation. A second pregnancy was marked by the recurrence of isolated increased nuchal translucency at 10 + 2 WG. Sanger prenatal diagnosis targeted on ASCC1 and CSPP1 variants showed the presence of the homozygous familial ASCC1 variant. In this case, prenatal exome sequencing analysis is subject to a partial ASCC1 phenotype and an undetectable CSPP1 phenotype at 10 weeks of gestation. As CSPP1 contribution is unclear or speculative to a potentially later in pregnancy or postnatal phenotype, it is mentioned as a variant of uncertain significance. The detection of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants involved in severe disorders but without phenotype-genotype correlation because the pregnancy is in the early stages or due to prenatally undetectable phenotypes, will encourage the clinical community to define future practices in molecular prenatal reporting.

### Treatment of cystic hygroma in a young infant through multidisciplinary approach involving sirolimus, sclerotherapy, and debulking surgery [^33ce8ac8]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Discussion

Cystic hygromas may potentially present anywhere in the body. Some of the common sites include the cervicofacial region (80% of cases), mediastinum, beneath the tongue, axilla, and groin. Sixty percent of CH present congenitally.Management of CH ideally is through surgical resection or sclerotherapy.A more recent management option is an antiproliferative agent: Sirolimus.Sirolimus (rapamycin) is an mTOR inhibitor that has a less drastic adverse effect profile than the preceding management modalities. It inhibits mTOR, which plays an integral role in several signaling cascades that involve cellular motility, angiogenesis, and cell growth.Because mTOR is the final common pathway mediating most vascular tumors, sirolimus is an important target to treat lymphangiomas and hemangiomas.,

Pharmacokinetics associated with sirolimus varies considerably because of its metabolism by cytochrome P450 enzymes, thereby depending on the maturation of these microsomal enzymes in young infants and neonates.Among the CYP450 enzymes, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, and CYP2C8 are the most commonly implicated in sirolimus clearance with 95% of metabolism carried out by CYP3A.

### First trimester cystic hygroma: does early detection matter? [^141f919a]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

To describe the association of abnormal outcomes with fetal cystic hygroma detected when crown-rump length measures less than 45mm, and to compare them to outcomes among fetuses with cystic hygroma detected when crown-rump length measures 45-84mm.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of fetuses with first trimester nuchal cystic hygroma from 2005 to 2015.

Results

A total of 212 fetuses were included. Abnormal karyotype was found in 20 of 46 (43.4%) fetuses with cystic hygroma detected when crown-rump length measured below 45mm, compared to 108 of 148 (73%) fetuses with cystic hygroma detected at crown-rump lengths of 45-84mm (p=0.001). There were no differences in rates of major structural anomaly (27% vs 36%; p=0.53) or pregnancy loss (23% vs 7%; p=0.22) among fetuses with normal karyotype. Those with cystic hygroma diagnosed at crown-rump lengths below 45mm were more likely to have a normal neonatal outcome compared to cases diagnosed with crown-rump lengths of 45-84mm (25% vs 11%; p=0.02).

Conclusion

Cystic hygroma detected when crown-rump length measures below 45mm have lower rates of chromosomal abnormalities and a higher proportion of normal birth outcomes when compared to those detected later in the first trimester. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

### Roberts syndrome with cystic hygroma: a rare clinical presentation of a rare syndrome [^e48a188f]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

According to Abbas et al, two geneticists of Colombian origin discovered the ESCO2 gene mutation located at 8p21.2, which is responsible for Roberts syndrome.Almeida et al also described a Brazilian study that dealt with the Roberts syndrome population and concluded replicating patterns of homologous alphoid centromeric DNA for 9, 11, 16 and 17 chromosomes with fluorescence in situ hybridisation analysis.However, there are no genotype or phenotype specifications established.Another notable description in the literature is the ‘rail-road track’ appearance of chromosomes, which is referred to as premature centromere separation and is a major diagnostic marker.

Babies with the syndrome are recorded to have birth lengths less than 37 cm, but those with more than 37 cm and fewer deformities tend to show better outcomes. One of the case reports described a child who survived until the age of 5 years of age, although most of the cases do not survive beyond infancy.Management of the survivors includes a holistic approach involving plastic surgeons, paediatricians, orthopaedics, physiotherapists, speech therapists, cardiologists, nephrologists, eye specialists, social workers and genetic counsellors to improve the quality of life and palliative care with all the possible corrections.A recurrence risk of 25% has been identified in couples with a positive family background, and it is recommended for them to conduct prenatal diagnosis using imaging and genetic modalities, and also propose to them a possible preimplantation diagnosis. Cytogenetic testing for Roberts syndrome remains the gold standard for diagnosis.The lack of genetic study in our patient and both parents is a significant gap in our case.

Cystic hygroma is a type of lymphangioma, which is a vascular anomaly associated with lymphatic malformations. It is formed by fluid accumulation, mainly located at the cervicofacial and axillary regions. Cystic hygroma is mostly located in the neck (75%), followed by the axilla (20%), the retroperitoneum and intra-abdominal organs (2%), the limbs and bones (2%) and the mediastinum (1%). It is often associated with chromosomal aneuploidies, hydrops fetalis and intrauterine fetal death. Its incidence is also increased in patients with multiple pterygium syndrome, Roberts syndrome, Noonan syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome and Proteus syndrome. Its prognosis depends on the presence of chromosome abnormalities, hydrops fetalis, septations within the lesion, lesions with thick walls and its association with other major malformations.

Turner syndrome—indications for genetic testing include single-feature triggers and multi-feature combinations. As the only clinical feature, testing is indicated for fetal cystic hygroma or hydrops (especially when severe), unexplained short stature, left-sided outflow congenital heart defects (excluding BAV), unexplained delayed puberty/menarche with failure to progress or secondary amenorrhea, infertility, or characteristic physical features. A section labeled “As least two of the following” lists renal anomaly, Madelung deformity, neuropsychologic problems and/or psychiatric issues, multiple typical or melanocytic nevi, dysplastic or hyperconvex nails, other congenital heart defects (including BAV), and hearing impairment <40 years of age together with short stature.

### Perinatal outcomes of cystic hygroma: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^cc291cc1]. American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology MFM (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to describe the perinatal outcomes and modifiers of antenatally diagnosed cystic hygroma (CH).

Data Sources

The PubMed, Embase and Web of Science Core Collection databases were searched from inception until March 18, 2024.

Study Eligibility Criteria

Full-text English-language observational cohort studies reporting any pregnancy and postnatal outcomes for fetuses with a CH diagnosed on prenatal ultrasound were included in this study.

Methods

The primary outcome was the incidence of genetic diagnosis and incidence of major structural anomalies. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of perinatal loss, termination of pregnancy, CH resolution, live birth rate and normal postnatal outcomes. Stratified analyses were conducted of cases diagnosed in the first trimester as well as all cases with septations as part of diagnostic criteria. Pooled proportions were calculated for the different outcomes.

Results

Fifty-seven studies met inclusion criteria (including 4693 cases of CH); these were cohort studies that included any of our primary search outcomes. The pooled prevalence of genetic diagnosis (56 studies, 3837 fetuses) was 55% (95% CI, 0.51-0.58). For specific aneuploidies, the pooled prevalence was 21% for Turner syndrome, 17% for Trisomy 21, 10% for Trisomy 18, 3% for Trisomy 13, and 5% for other genetic diagnoses. The overall pooled prevalence of major structural anomalies (30 studies, 1987 fetuses) was 42%; across 16 studies (1815 fetuses), 16% of fetuses with CH and an additional structural abnormality had no identified genetic diagnosis. Furthermore, 20% of all CH regressed or resolved during the pregnancy. The findings from the studies that that defined CH by the presence of septations, as well as those focusing solely on first trimester CH were consistent with the overall outcomes.

Conclusions

Our findings confirm that while CHs have a strong association with common trisomies and Turner syndrome, there is a proportion of cases with nonaneuploidy genetic diagnoses. Forty percent of cases are also associated with other structural anomalies that may be able to be elicited with a detailed first trimester anatomic ultrasound. Further studies should explore modifiers of CH outcomes to allow for more accurate and tailored patient counseling.

### Screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities: ACOG practice bulletin, number 226 [^1c629039]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin No. 226—management of ultrasonographic markers for aneuploidy: first‑trimester cystic hygroma is defined by characteristic cystic structures and has a high aneuploidy association, warranting counseling, diagnostic testing, and comprehensive US evaluation. Imaging criteria are “Large single or multilocular fluid‑filled cavities, in the nuchal region and can extend the length of the fetus.” The aneuploidy association states “About 50% are aneuploid.” Management is: “Genetic counseling. Offer diagnostic testing. Comprehensive US evaluation including a detailed US at 18–22 weeks and fetal cardiac US.”

### Spontaneous resolution of a recurrent axillary cystic hygroma following acute infection [^bcb54629]. BMJ Case Reports (2015). Medium credibility.

We report a case of spontaneous resolution of a recurrent axillary cystic hygroma in a 4-year-old boy. He presented with a 1-year history of a cystic lump in the left axilla, which intermittently changed in size. Ultrasound suggested it was a lipoma, with raised suspicions of vascular malformation. Scans were discussed in a multidisciplinary meeting and provisional diagnosis of lymphocele or slow flow lymphovascular malformation was made. It was surgically excised and histology confirmed the lesion to be a cystic hygroma. However, it recurred within 3weeks. The patient was booked for aspiration and treatment with sclerotic agent OK 432. He developed acute infection in the cystic hygroma a week before surgical intervention and was treated with antibiotics for 5days by his general practitioner. Acute infection led to complete spontaneous resolution of the cystic hygroma within a week. There are no other reported cases in which recurrent cystic hygroma has resolved after a week of acute infection.

### Neonatal neck mass in identical twins: an unusual presentation [^f9ac9e27]. American Journal of Perinatology (2005). Low credibility.

Identical twins were noted to have a soft asymptomatic neck mass, each on the opposite side, at 1 week of age. The mass took a dramatic course 1 week later to present as a neck abscess, yet without systemic symptoms. Ultrasonography was highly suggestive of an infected lymphatic malformation (cystic hygroma). Intravenous antibiotics and drainage (aspiration/incision and drainage) resulted in resolution of the mass and no recurrence at 18 months follow-up. The concept of spontaneous involution of lymphatic malformation (cystic hygroma) is discussed as well as the management of neck abscesses in infancy.

### Natural history and outcome of prenatally diagnosed cystic hygroma [^138e5907]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To define the outcome in cases of cystic hygroma diagnosed from a routine obstetric population.

Method

This was a retrospective study of 42 cases of fetal cystic hygroma detected at 11 to 23 weeks' gestation in a routine obstetric population of 25 352 pregnancies. Fetal cystic hygroma was categorized according to position, severity, presence of cardiac defects and Hydrops fetalis.

Results

There were 20 (47.6%) cases with aneuploidy (9 trisomies and 11 Turner's syndrome). Major congenital cardiac defects were identified in 12 (28.6%) cases. Regression of the hygroma was noted in 2/20 (10%) of the aneuploid pregnancies and 3/17 (17.6%) of the euploid pregnancies. The majority (90.0%) of the aneuploid fetuses were female. In contrast, 70.58% of the fetuses in the euploid group were male and all the surviving normal babies were also male (n = 3).

Conclusion

The findings of this study would support invasive prenatal diagnosis for an ultrasound finding of fetal cystic hygroma. Even in euploid pregnancies with cystic hygroma, there is a high mortality with associated abnormalities. The data also suggest a guarded pregnancy prognosis for the finding of fetal cystic hygroma, and that it is improved with spontaneous resolution, especially in male fetuses of normal karyotype.

### Treatment of cystic hygroma in a young infant through multidisciplinary approach involving sirolimus, sclerotherapy, and debulking surgery [^f73a335d]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Case report

An 8-month-old boy was hospitalized since his birth for extensive cystic hygroma. The mother is a 47-year-old healthy woman. She is gravida 9, para 6, plus 2 with no consanguinity, no chronic disease in the family, and no history of congenital anomalies. Her pregnancy was unremarkable with regular follow ups until the antenatal presentation of an enormous neck mass and polyhydramnios during the 27th gestational week. She went into labor in 35th week and underwent emergency cesarean section and along with extrauterine intrapartum airway intervention (EXIT) due to extensive neonatal neck mass that would potentially compromise the neonate's airway. The EXIT procedure is usually done for any fetus with a large neck mass before cutting the umbilical cord.

The patient exhibited no dysmorphism, with the large neck mass mainly involving the right side of the neck. His tongue was also involved, posing a challenge for conventional treatment with sclerotherapy. His chest, abdomen, cardiac, genitalia, and back were unremarkable. The birth weight was 3.08 kg. Baseline magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Fig 1) done 2 days after his birth showed a mass with a volume of 370 mL. The diagnosis was cystic hygroma.

### Prenatal diagnosis of fetal chest lymphangioma [^261b29c0]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Objective

Prenatally diagnosed cystic nuchal hygroma is often associated with chromosomal anomalies and hydrops fetalis. Chest lymphangioma diagnosed later in gestation appears to be a completely different disease, with a low incidence of chromosomal and structural anomalies.

Methods

Two chest cavernous lymphangiomas of the fetus are presented. The sonographic images, chromosomal analyses, and macroscopic and microscopic evaluations are described.

Results

Fetal chest cavernous lymphangiomas were identified at 15 and 22 weeks' gestation. In the first case, the couple decided to interrupt gestation. In the second case, prenatal sonography showed a multilocular, cystic lymphangioma external to the chest wall with no flow on Doppler sonography. Follow-up sonography revealed normal fetal growth and slow enlargement of the cystic mass surrounding the left chest cavity. The neonate was delivered without complications and was treated surgically.

Conclusions

The chest lymphangioma appears to be a lesion usually not associated with other congenital abnormalities. The prenatal diagnosis of chest wall lymphangioma is relatively easy sonographically, and the treatment of choice is surgical excision. The outcome is relatively favorable, with a low incidence of chromosomal and structural anomalies.

### Cysts, pits, and tumors [^aa54ed9a]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2009). Low credibility.

Summary

This article discusses common pediatric skin and subcutaneous lesions grouped into three categories: cysts, pits, and tumors. Vascular malformations and hemangiomas are covered elsewhere in this supplement and are not discussed here. In addition, only benign tumors that typically present to the plastic surgeon are mentioned. In a minority of cases, further investigation, in the form of imaging or biopsy, will be required to establish the diagnosis and allow appropriate management. In this article, the authors concentrate on the relevant information required to triage and treat these conditions.

### Prenatal and differential diagnosis of fetal thoracolumbar lymphangioma [^467e47b9]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Summary

We present a case of a woman in her mid-30s at 21 weeks of gestation referred to our tertiary medical center by an outside clinic with an ultrasound finding of a cystic septated lesion on the left side of the fetal chest.

The differential diagnosis included, among others, foetal nuchal oedema, cystic hygroma, meningocele, encephalocele, cervical teratoma, haemangioma and subchorionic placental cyst. The sonographic finding of lack of intralesional vascularity on Doppler, seemingly without communication with the spinal canal, pointed us towards a diagnosis of foetal cystic lymphangioma. Our diagnosis was confirmed postnatally.

Foetal cystic lymphangiomas are rare benign congenital tumours of the vascular and lymphatic systems. The differential diagnosis is broad, and a timely diagnosis positively affects the prognosis. If a lymphangioma is suspected, we suggest referral to specialists in maternal–foetal medicine with expertise in the field.

### Giant ranula of the neck: differentiation from cystic hygroma [^21ae8682]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Occasionally, diving ranulas may attain large dimensions (giant ranula); gross involvement of the submandibular and parapharyngeal spaces makes differentiation from other cystic neck masses, particularly cystic hygroma, difficult. As diving ranula and cystic hygroma are managed with different surgical approaches, avoidance of this pitfall is critical. Our purpose was to review the imaging findings of giant ranula and compare them with those of cystic hygroma to define those features that are helpful in differentiating these different disease entities.

Methods

We conducted a retrospective review of all cases of ranulas that had been surgically treated at our institution in a 15-year period. These were compared with cases of cystic hygroma that involved the same anatomic regions. Images were analyzed for anatomic location and morphology, with specific attention paid to those characteristics that might assist differentiation. Giant ranula was defined as any ranula that significantly involved the paraphyngeal space in addition to the submandibular space.

Results

Six patients with giant ranula and fifteen patients with cystic hygroma were reviewed. All giant ranulas retained tapered communication with the sublingual space and were homogeneous, thin-walled, anatomically defined, fluid-containing masses. One infected lesion enhanced, and another previously operated lesion demonstrated mild septation. Cystic hygroma commonly did not communicate with the sublingual space and had features of lobulation, septation and heterogeneity. Additional involvement of spaces not typically involved by ranula further assisted differentiation.

Conclusion

Although giant ranulas may superficially resemble cystic hygroma, several imaging features allow confident differentiation of these two entities.

### Early ultrasonographic changes in fowler syndrome features and review of the literature [^8b6abbc8]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Fowler syndrome is characterized by hydranencephaly, brain stem and basal ganglion calcifications, a glomeruloid vasculopathy of the brain vessels, and a fetal akinesia deformation sequence with muscular hypoplasia. The natural progression of the ultrasonographic features of Fowler syndrome has never been described.

Methods

Case report and review of the literature.

Results

A primiparous woman with a negative ultrasound at 11 weeks of pregnancy was noted at 15 weeks to have fetal nuchal thickening, generalized skin edema, prominent lateral ventricles, akinesia with arthrogryposis, and pterygia. At 18 weeks, a cystic hygroma with facial edema, hypertelorism, and hydrocephaly were noted; the limb deformity was still evident. Within 1 week, the cystic hygroma regressed partially, but the hydrocephaly deteriorated.

Conclusion

The multiple ultrasonographic features of Fowler syndrome may not occur simultaneously and their severity may vary with gestational age.

### Involvement of the brachial plexus and its branches by cystic hygromas [^a370582f]. Journal of Neurosurgery: Pediatrics (2011). Low credibility.

Lymphatic malformations that involve the nervous system are uncommon. The authors review their experience with involvement of the brachial plexus and its branches by cystic hygromas. A retrospective review of the authors' experience with pathology of the pediatric brachial plexus revealed 4 cases involving patients with compression of this structure and its branches due to cystic hygroma. Although such cases are apparently rare, the neurosurgeon should consider malformations of the lymphatic system in the differential diagnosis of masses involving the brachial plexus and its branches.

### Massive benign pericardial cyst presenting with simultaneous superior vena cava and middle lobe syndromes [^53d4d745]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Discussion

Primary mediastinal cysts constitute approximately one fifth of all mediastinal masses. The cysts may originate from pleura or pericardium, tracheobronchial tree, gastrointestinal tract, neurogenic tissue, thymus gland or lymphoid tissue. Benign teratomas may present as epidermoid cysts, dermoid cysts or cystic teratomas. Mediastinal cystic masses may also result from specific or non-specific infections or parasitic infestations like Echinococcus.

Anterior mediastinal cysts most commonly are pleuropericardial, thymic, teratomatous or cystic hygromas.

Pleuropericardial cysts are benign mesothelial cysts that arise as a result of persistence of one of the mesenchymal lacunae that normally fuse to form the pericardial sac, or, as suggested by Lillie, due to the failure of an embryological ventral diverticulum to fuse. Alternatively, they may be believed to arise from the infolding of the advancing edge of the pleura during its embryological development. These cysts are unilocular, contain clear watery fluid, present typically in anterior cardiophrenic angle, more often on right side than left. Microscopically, the wall has a single layer of mesothelial cells resting on a loose stroma of connective tissue.

True thymic cysts are thin walled, unilocular and contain normal thymic tissue within their walls and arise from third branchial pouch. Microscopically, the wall is lined by low cuboidal epithelium. However, malignant degeneration within a thymoma may result in a cystic thymoma, with a residual mass projecting into the cavity of the cyst from the wall.

Typically, lymphangiomas arise from neck and extend into mediastinum. They contain chyle and are classified according to the size of the spaces into cystic hygromas or cavernous lymphangiomas. Cystic hygromas are multiloculated, and a mediastinal hygroma is almost always an extension of a cervical hygroma. However, rarely, a uniloculated primary anterior mediastinal lymphogenous cyst containing yellow or brown fluid may be found.

### Prenatal and differential diagnosis of fetal thoracolumbar lymphangioma [^1e5faf82]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

Our case represents a successful diagnosis of cystic lymphangioma reached via sonogram and confirmed after birth, with a benign outcome.

Similar cases to ours were previously described in the literature—two presented by García in Spain, one by Masson in Pakistan and two by Saccone in Italy.

Nuchal oedema, meningocele, encephalocele, cervical teratoma, pseudomembranes, haemangioma and subchorial placental cyst should be considered as part of the differential diagnosis.

Lymphangioma, though typically benign, possesses a rare potential for invasion, and its growth rate, although infrequent, can result in compressive symptoms affecting adjacent organs and tissues.

Thus, prenatal regular monitoring of its growth through volume assessment becomes imperative.

It is predominantly located in the neck and the axillary region; only 5% manifest in the mediastinum, chest, lungs, abdominal wall, abdominal cavity, mesentery and retroperitoneum.

Prenatal diagnosis is achievable through ultrasound in up to 79% of cases,particularly in the second and third trimesters. 1.400000000000000e+01

Ultrasonographic characteristics reveal septation in most of the cases, which divides the mass into multiple cysts filled with fluid.

Academically, we recognise three main types: microcystic/honeycomb (capillary lymphangioma), usually in extremities; macrocystic (cavernous lymphangioma), usually in the neck/head regions; and mixed lesions.

Large septated lesions in the foetal neck are usually called cystic hygromas.

Our case looked more like a macrocystic type.

The pathophysiology is ascribed to the anomalous development of primitive lymphatic channels during early pregnancy.

There could be a failure of the primitive lymphatic sac to connect to the venous system or the inadequate development of lymphatic tissue in the correct location during embryogenesis.

### Diagnostic performance of chromosomal microarray and whole exome sequencing in fetal structural anomalies: a single-center retrospective study [^3a7aa3d1]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2025). Medium credibility.

WES achieved a diagnostic yield of 22.2% for pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants, with the highest rates seen in central nervous system anomalies (46.1%) and skeletal anomalies (38.8%). Negative WES results were observed in cases with increased NT and cystic hygroma because the majority of fetuses presenting with increased nuchal translucency (NT) or cystic hygroma are typically diagnosed through CMA or conventional karyotyping. Consequently, the likelihood of identifying additional monogenic causes via WES in these cases is reduced. The low diagnostic yield observed in the WES group with increased NT or cystic hygroma in our study may primarily be due to the prior exclusion of cases already diagnosed by CMA. This reflects the typical clinical workflow where WES is generally considered as a secondary test following negative CMA results. Similarly, Daum et al. (2019) reported a 25% diagnostic yield in fetuses with structural anomalies referred for exome sequencing, with the highest yields observed in those with multiple malformations and brain anomalies. No pathogenic variants were detected in fetuses with isolated increased nuchal translucency, consistent with our findings. These results support the selective use of WES based on specific phenotypic features to maximize diagnostic efficiency. The current study’s pathogenic diagnostic rate for prenatal WES analysis was consistent with previous studies’ diagnostic rates (ranging from 10 to 30%) [–,]. These results are aligned with meta-analyses and cohort studies that highlight the superior yield of WES in fetuses with single-system or syndromic malformations, especially when conventional tests are non-diagnostic [–,]. Several studies give different diagnostic rates, which were affected by several factors such as cohort size variant interpretation, and prenatal indications (Table 4) [,–] Consistent with recent literature higher diagnostic rates of WES were observed in cases with musculoskeletal anomalies (38,8%,7/18) and central nervous system anomalies (46,1%, 6/13) [,–]. The results reaffirm the role of WES in the evaluation of monogenic disorders in these systems.

### First-trimester septated cystic hygroma: prevalence, natural history, and pediatric outcome [^d1b30aea]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate prevalence, natural history, and outcome of septated cystic hygroma in the first trimester in the general obstetric population, and to differentiate this finding from simple increased nuchal translucency.

Methods

Patients at 10.3-13.6 weeks of gestation underwent nuchal translucency sonography as part of a multicenter clinical trial. Septated cystic hygroma cases were offered chorionic villi sampling for karyotype, and targeted fetal anatomical and cardiac evaluations. Survivors were followed up for fetal and long-term pediatric outcome (median 25 months, range 12-50 months). Cases of septated cystic hygroma were also compared with cases of simple increased nuchal translucency.

Results

There were 134 cases of cystic hygroma (2 lost to follow-up) among 38,167 screened patients (1 in 285). Chromosomal abnormalities were diagnosed in 67 (51%), including 25 trisomy-21, 19 Turner syndrome, 13 trisomy-18, and 10 others. Major structural fetal malformations (primarily cardiac and skeletal) were diagnosed in 22 of the remaining 65 cases (34%). There were 5 cases (8%) of fetal death and 15 cases of elective pregnancy termination without evidence of abnormality. One of 23 (4%) normal survivors was diagnosed with cerebral palsy and developmental delay. Overall, survival with normal pediatric outcome was confirmed in 17% of cases (22 of 132). Compared with simple increased nuchal translucency, cystic hygroma has 5-fold, 12-fold, and 6-fold increased risk of aneuploidy, cardiac malformation, and perinatal death, respectively.

Conclusion

First-trimester cystic hygroma was a frequent finding in a general obstetric screening program. It has the strongest prenatal association with aneuploidy described to date, with significantly worse outcome compared with simple increased nuchal translucency. Most pregnancies with normal evaluation at the completion of the second trimester resulted in a healthy infant with a normal pediatric outcome.

### Indications, advantages and limitations of perinatal postmortem imaging in clinical practice [^ba99e4b3]. Pediatric Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Fig. 2 
Cystic hygroma in female foetus of 14 weeks gestation. Hygroma was suspected on antenatal US scan (not shown), with the impression of a neck mass on postmortem radiograph (a). Postmortem MRI (b) was difficult to obtain because of size constraints, but postmortem US (c) was useful to delineate a bilateral cystic neck mass, which was confirmed to be cystic hygroma at autopsy

Fig. 3 
Postmortem US and MRI in a female foetus of 22 weeks gestation. a Cranial postmortem US. b Corresponding coronal T2-weighted postmortem MRI. Both show normal intracranial appearances. Note the minor deviation of the brainstem in the postmortem US image, caused by positioning

Compared to antenatal US examination, postmortem US has several significant potential advantages for achieving optimal imaging: the body can be positioned in an optimal orientation with no movement, and the high-frequency probes can be used in close proximity to the target tissue. However, both pliability and postmortem changes within tissues can pose a problem in accurate localisation of lesions in postmortem US in foetuses, and rigor mortis can present further adaptation problems. Postmortem US also requires the operator to be in prolonged direct contact with the body, which may inhibit the widespread uptake of this technique by practitioners. With relatively inexpensive and easy-to-acquire hardware, postmortem US has the potential to contribute greatly to postmortem imaging in this setting but further research is required to determine optimal methods and approaches.

Although percutaneous organ biopsy using surface landmarks has been attempted, US-guided percutaneous biopsy has not been studied in detail in foetuses. Neonatal percutaneous biopsy samples do not always yield adequate tissue volumes, and when they do so they may still be non-diagnostic. As such, although US-guided percutaneous biopsy may be an attractive method of noninvasive tissue sampling, and it shows good success rates in older children, there may be technical limitations in foetuses and stillbirths including small size, accuracy and postmortem artefacts making organ differentiation difficult. With continuing improvements in imaging and experience, image-guided biopsy may become more important when fully developed.

### Perinatal post-mortem ultrasound (PMUS): radiological-pathological correlation [^fd2ec5b3]. Insights Into Imaging (2019). Medium credibility.

Musculoskeletal and soft tissue malformations

Where an underlying skeletal disorder is suspected, assessment of the whole skeleton is best performed by external examination and radiography (also known as a skeletal survey or babygram). These are most useful over 8 weeks gestation, given the lack of skeletal ossification prior to this age. It is also important to remember that although isolated limb anomalies may be more commonly encountered in live cases, lethal skeletal dysplasias will be more prevalent in the subgroup presenting for post-mortem imaging so an entire overview of the body is usually necessary rather than imaging of the affected limb(s). Whilst PMUS can be useful in demonstrating the non-ossified, cartilaginous anatomy which is not present on radiography (Fig. 23), it is rarely used in isolation to make a skeletal diagnosis and would be better reserved for the assessment of soft tissues.

Fig. 23 
Thanatophoric dysplasia in a foetus at 22 weeks gestation, following termination of pregnancy. The frontal projection of the skeletal survey (a), acquired 2 days after delivery, demonstrates shortened long bones and curved femora with a trident appearance to the acetabulae. Post-mortem ultrasound images in sagittal plane of the left humerus (b) and left femur (c) reveal irregular metaphyses (solid arrows) and curved long bones. On ultrasound, it is also possible to visualise the unossified epiphyses (dotted arrows)

Soft tissue lesions at PMUS may include venolymphatic (and other vascular) malformations (Fig. 24) or teratomas (as previously shown in Fig. 8). In cases where a foetus is referred with a prenatal diagnosis of cystic hygroma (usually in the setting of foetal hydrops), we have also found that these cystic masses can ‘resolve’, much like the appearances of ventriculomegaly, thus the role of PMUS is to review associated structural anomalies rather than identify the cystic hygroma itself. Associated anomalies (commonly intracranial in origin) are estimated to occur in 36–55.6% of cases, and usually related to an abnormal genetic karyotype which will have implications for prenatal counselling in future pregnancies.

### PIGO gene variants: new insights into prenatal diagnosis [^81c6609d]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Medium credibility.

1 Fetal Phenotype

A 28‐year‐old woman was referred to the Toulouse University Hospital at 13 weeks of gestation (WoG) for ultrasound anomaly presenting a male fetus with cystic hygroma, omphalocele, and retrognathia (Table 1A, Figure 1A). The couple requested a termination of pregnancy (TOP) at 16 WoG. Fetal autopsy confirmed the ultrasound findings and revealed craniofacial dysmorphia, cystic kidney dysplasia, absent ossification of cervical vertebral bodies, and a wide anterior fontanel (Figure 1C, E). Eight months later, the patient was referred to our unit due to recurrent ultrasound anomalies at 13 WoG, showing a female fetus with cystic hygroma and diffuse subcutaneous edema. A complementary ultrasound at 14 + 1 WoG confirmed these findings and revealed bilateral dysplastic kidneys (Figure 1B). The patient underwent a TOP at 15 + 2 WoG. Fetal autopsy corroborated the ultrasound findings and revealed additional phenotypes of anal atresia, incomplete cleft of the maxillary alveolar ridge, retrognathia, absent ossification of cervical vertebral bodies, and craniofacial dysmorphia (Figure 1D, F). These observations raised suspicion of a recurrence of the pathology observed in the first fetus. The parents were not consanguineous and there was no other relevant element in the obstetric or familial history.

### Noonan syndrome: improving recognition and diagnosis [^eaaa8ed0]. Archives of Disease in Childhood (2022). Medium credibility.

In the fetus

Prenatal features are frequent in fetuses with NS, including increased nuchal translucency, persistent nuchal fold, distended jugular lymphatic sacs, cystic hygroma, hydrops fetalis, pleural or pericardial effusion, polyhydramnios, cardiac and renal anomalies, and specific dysmorphic facial features.In prospective genetic studies, mutations of genes implicated in NS have been reported in up to 16% of fetuses with an increased nuchal translucency and a normal karyotype.Prenatal genetic testing is offered in some countries. However, antenatal diagnosis is not systematically proposed even when ultrasound features are found, considering the impossibility of predicting phenotypical expression precisely and the fact that most individuals with NS have a quite favourable prognosis. Ultrasonographers and obstetricians are well placed to recognise these characteristics, but it is currently unknown what proportion of fetuses with NS actually show prenatal anomalies.

In the neonatal period

The perinatal period is a particularly important time for NS diagnosis, but the condition is not always easy to recognise. Neonatologists should keep in mind the suggestive prenatal history (see above) and the distinctive facial features of NS (figure 3).Other features that may be present at that age include heart defects (especially pulmonary valve stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), cryptorchidism in boysand feeding difficulties/failure to thrive.Lymphatic dysplasia may manifest with congenital chylothorax or hydrops.

### Screening for fetal chromosomal abnormalities: ACOG practice bulletin, number 226 [^b1039fe1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). High credibility.

First-trimester ultrasound—nuchal translucency (NT) and cystic hygroma: Nuchal translucency is the primary ultrasound marker to assess first-trimester chromosomal risk, and an increased NT measurement increases the risk of genetic syndromes and anomalies. An increased NT with septations along the fetal length is termed cystic hygroma; in a retrospective cohort of 944 fetuses with a cystic hygroma, a karyotype abnormality occurred in 55% and a major congenital anomaly occurred in 29% of fetuses with a normal karyotype, perinatal loss occurred in 39% not electively terminated, and overall an abnormal outcome occurred in 87%. If an enlarged NT or an anomaly is identified, the patient should be offered genetic counseling and diagnostic testing for genetic conditions as well as detailed ultrasonography at 18–22 weeks of gestation to assess for structural abnormalities, and referral for fetal cardiac ultrasonography may be beneficial.

### Cerebro-costo-mandibular syndrome in a father and a female fetus: early prenatal ultrasonographic diagnosis and autosomal dominant transmission [^f3cd71e9]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2001). Low credibility.

Ultrasonography in a female fetus revealed cystic cervical hygroma, severe micrognathia, and vertebral and upper limb anomalies suggestive of cerebro-costo-mandibular syndrome (CCMS) which was diagnosed ultrasonographically at 16 weeks' gestation. The father is affected and presents with a Pierre Robin sequence, short stature and typical costovertebral anomalies. CCMS is a rare and severe disorder. The high frequency of sporadic cases, vertical transmission, and the excess of sibs affected via horizontal transmission suggest dominant autosomal mutation with possible germinal mosaicism. The vertical familial case detailed in the present report is a reminder of the high risk when one parent or one sibling is affected and the extreme variability of phenotype and costal ossification. Early prenatal ultrasound diagnosis is possible in a severely affected fetus.

### Treatment of cystic hygroma in a young infant through multidisciplinary approach involving sirolimus, sclerotherapy, and debulking surgery [^22d6ecc2]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Conclusion

Sirolimus is a novel therapy for vascular anomalies. A multidisciplinary approach that involves administering sirolimus and sclerotherapy in addition to a debulking surgery is likely to improve the outcome in patients with cervicofacial lymphatic malformations. However, further studies on larger groups should be conducted to standardize this management approach.

### Genetic diseases underlying a spectrum of fetal effusions [^52300dcc]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

Nonimmune hydrops fetalis is well understood to be heterogenous and the common endpoint of many genetic diseases. However, less is known about the prevalence and presenting features of genetic diseases that underlie other types of fetal effusions such as single effusions, leaving uncertainty in clinical practice about optimal approaches to testing and counseling for these pregnancies. We aimed to determine the diagnostic yield of exome sequencing by type of fetal effusion and presence of concurrent structural abnormalities and to identify the unique presenting features of underlying genetic diseases.

Study Design

We conducted a prospective cohort study of pregnancies with nonimmune hydrops fetalis and other fetal effusions, with participants enrolled from across the United States. Inclusion criteria were nondiagnostic results of chromosomal microarray and/or karyotype and the presence of at least 1 fetal effusion, including nuchal translucency ≥3.5 mm, cystic hygroma, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, ascites, and/or skin edema. Exome sequencing was performed by our institution's Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-approved laboratory and results were returned to participants and their providers. Detailed fetal phenotypic data were ascertained and used to inform genetic variant interpretation, including fetal imaging findings (ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, and echocardiogram), pathology reports, and laboratory reports. Pregnancies with a variant or variants classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic were considered diagnostic or positive. The primary outcome was the diagnostic yield of exome sequencing by the type of fetal effusion, with and without concurrent structural abnormalities. Secondary outcomes were the types of fetal effusions observed by category of genetic disease.

Results

In all, 118 pregnancies with nonimmune hydrops fetalis and other effusions underwent exome sequencing and 23% (27/118) had positive (diagnostic) findings. Pregnancies with nonimmune hydrops fetalis with and without concurrent structural abnormalities had diagnostic yields of 21% (9/42) and 40% (6/15), respectively (P=.15). Single effusions such as pleural effusion with and without concurrent structural abnormalities had diagnostic yields of 23% (6/26) and 17% (1/6), respectively (P=.61). The diagnostic yield for increased nuchal translucency or cystic hygroma was significantly greater for pregnancies with concurrent structural abnormalities (42%, 5/12) compared to those without (0%, 0/17, P<.01). We further observed numerous patterns in terms of how genetic diseases present in utero, such as RASopathies and musculoskeletal disorders demonstrating all types of effusions, while other disorders marked by neurodevelopmental delays after birth demonstrated all types of effusions except for nonimmune hydrops fetalis.

Conclusion

The diagnostic yield of exome sequencing was high across all types of effusions including single effusions with and without concurrent structural abnormalities, with the exception of isolated increased nuchal translucency or cystic hygroma. Furthermore, we observed numerous patterns in terms of how genetic diseases present in utero with fetal effusions. These findings contribute important information for counseling and clinical management, highlight the utility of exome sequencing for fetal effusions beyond nonimmune hydrops fetalis, and inform accurate results of phenotype-driven tests such as exome sequencing.

### Ultrasonography of intra-abdominal cystic lesions in the newborn [^f5ff20c0]. Clinical Radiology (2003). Low credibility.

Intra-abdominal cystic lesions are increasingly recognized in the newborn because of the advent of routine antenatal ultrasonography. As these lesions are often asymptomatic or non-specific in clinical presentation in the newborn, imaging by ultrasonography has an important role in diagnosis. We present a pictorial review of the commonly encountered intra-abdominal cystic lesions in the newborn, with emphasis on ultrasonographic features that can aid differentiation between the various lesions.

### Prenatal and differential diagnosis of fetal thoracolumbar lymphangioma [^933825a7]. BMJ Case Reports (2025). High credibility.

Background

Congenital lymphangiomas are benign tumours affecting the vascular and lymphatic systems. Four types are described in the literature: capillary lymphangioma, cavernous lymphangioma, cystic lymphangioma or hygroma and haemolymphangioma.

Congenital lymphangiomas constitute 4% of all vascular tumours.Some publications report an incidence of 1 in every 6000 live births,while others suggest lower rates, ranging from 0.8 to 18 per 10 000 live births.

These lymphatic malformations usually originate in the first trimester of pregnancy due to disembryogenesis of the lymphatic vascular tissue, generating a failure in the anastomosis of the lymphatic vessels and giving rise to blind vessels. They are usually benign, but their growth can be rapid, and they can eventually compress adjacent tissues.

These tumours manifest during prenatal care via sonogram as cystic masses, with or without septations, usually during the second and third trimesters of gestation.

Mortality with a timely prenatal diagnosis is rare.

The recommended delivery route is controversial: some authors recommend caesarean section—depending on the size and location of the lesion.

The recommended gestational age at delivery is also controversial, with no clear guidelines available.

In the case of lymphangiomas in the cervical region and oral cavity, the risk of neonatal asphyxia is imminent, due to the compression they exert on the airway. An ex utero intrapartum or fetal endoscopic tracheal intubation procedure can be performed in such cases.

A comprehensive understanding of their ultrasonographic characteristics is imperative for a timely prenatal diagnosis, and our case adds to the existing literature.

### Natural course of fetal axillary lymphangioma based on prenatal ultrasound studies [^3341898a]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

This series and literature review aimed to prenatally characterize the nature of axillary lymphangioma. A total of 30 cases, including our 5 cases, were analyzed. Insights gained from this review are as follows: Septate and nonseptate cysts seem to be different entities. The nonseptate type tends to be small and transient but more highly associated with aneuploidies. Septate cysts are very rarely associated with other abnormalities and hydrops fetalis, unlike cystic hygroma colli, but are more progressive with gestational age and associated with adverse outcomes. The cases with high flow have a higher risk of intralesional hemorrhage. Prenatal diagnosis is important for the route of timely delivery and possibly prenatal interventions. Shoulder dystocia is common and should always be taken into account for decisions on the route of delivery.

### Additional benefits of first trimester screening [^0f4b8fbf]. Seminars in Perinatology (2005). Low credibility.

The goal of first trimester screening for aneuploidy is to provide patients their risk assessment for fetal Down syndrome. Nonetheless, it has been noted that combined screening offers physicians and patients other important pregnancy information. For example, first trimester ultrasound results in accurate pregnancy dating and enables the early diagnosis of multiple gestations during the period when amnionicity and chorionicity is best discerned. It also detects a limited number of fetal anatomical abnormalities, affording patients time to make decisions regarding the management of their pregnancies. A cystic hygroma, one of the most powerful ultrasound markers for fetal aneuploidy, can be detected on first trimester ultrasound. An enlarged nuchal translucency may identify fetuses at risk for other adverse outcomes and for congenital heart defects. In addition, abnormal first trimester serum markers are associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes, and knowledge of these abnormalities may help with patient counseling and management.

### What is the role of the 11-to 14-week ultrasound in women with negative cell-free DNA screening for aneuploidy? [^10de93e9]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

This study aimed to examine the role of the 11- to 14-week ultrasound in women with negative cell-free DNA screening.

Methods

A retrospective cohort study of women at increased risk for aneuploidy based on age or medical history and negative cell-free DNA screening between March 2012 and March 2014 was conducted. Patients were included if they had an 11- to 14-week ultrasound and obstetrical care at our center(s). Primary outcome was an unexpected finding at ultrasound. Imaging findings were compared with obstetrical outcome by medical record review.

Results

Study group was composed of 1739 patients. An unexpected finding was identified in 60/1739 (3.5%). An abnormal fetal finding occurred in 37 living fetuses (2.1%); 33 had a nuchal translucency (NT)≥3mm, including four 'isolated' cystic hygroma and three with a structural abnormality. Four fetuses had a structural anomaly without a thick NT. Karyotype confirmed euploidy in 98.7% of available cases. Pregnancy termination was chosen by 63.6% of those with cystic hygroma or anomaly at the 11- to 14-week scan. Unexpected multiples were identified in 13 (0.7%) women and a fetal demise in 10 (0.6%).

Conclusion

Unexpected findings at the 11- to 14-week scan occur in 3.5% of patients with negative cell-free DNA. Recognition provides options for comprehensive testing, consultation, and management.

### Targeted ultrasound examination and DNA testing for noonan syndrome, in fetuses with increased nuchal translucency and normal karyotype [^14688da2]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To define sonographic criteria that may improve the prenatal diagnosis of Noonan syndrome by targeted DNA testing.

Methods

We searched our Fetal Medicine Unit records for all cases with a final diagnosis of Noonan syndrome. A literature review was undertaken to identify the sonographic features of Noonan syndrome fetuses. Information was pooled to define the most common features.

Results

In our database, we identified three cases of Noonan syndrome. The diagnosis was suspected prenatally in two of them. Thirty-nine cases were identified in the literature. In the presented cases we show that suspicion of Noonan syndrome should arise when, after an increased nuchal translucency, ultrasound investigation in the second trimester shows a persistant nuchal fold (NF) or cystic hygroma in combination with at least one of the following features: hydrops fetalis, pleural effusion, cardiac anomalies, polyhydramnios or specific facial abnormalities.

Conclusion

Prenatal ultrasound findings in Noonan syndrome can be subtle and aspecific, but when specific characteristics are present additional targeted DNA analysis is indicated.

### Treatment of cystic hygroma in a young infant through multidisciplinary approach involving sirolimus, sclerotherapy, and debulking surgery [^272f5eeb]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

Introduction

Cystic hygromas are macrocystic lymphatic malformations that develop during the sixth gestational week.Cystic hygromas (CH) mostly present in the neck and comprise 20% to 25% of cervical lymphatic tumors. Mainstay treatment of CH involves complete surgical resection and sclerotherapy. Sclerotherapy has been consistently chosen over the other modalities. Oosthuizen et alreported a management algorithm that incorporated sclerotherapy and surgery in the management of cervicofacial lymphatic malformation. Sclerotherapy has been consistently employed in the management of lymphatic malformations with notable reduction (30%) and sometimes complete eradication of cystic hygrma.Intralesional bleomycin helped achieve complete clinical remission in 47% of patients, greater than 50% reduction in 35.8%, and less than 50% reduction in 17.1% in a 70-patient trial.However, sclerotherapy has many adverse effects including swelling at the site of the lesion, scarring, pulmonary fibrosis, hemorrhage, and infection.Additionally, sclerotherapy may be futile in the management of cysts not accessible for injections. Therefore, we propose a more effective approach that involves combining sirolimus to the aforementioned modalities. Sirolimus inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR).Specifically, sirolimus binds to FK506 to form a protein complex that avidly binds to mTOR resulting in dephosphorylation and deactivation of p70S6 kinase, which, in turn, results in the decrease of vascular endothelial growth factor C, a stimulant of lymphatic endothelial cells.Blatt et alreported the first successful use of sirolimus in the management of kaposiform hemangioendothelioma.

Herein, we present remarkable reduction of extensive cystic hygroma in a 15-month-old infant through a debulking surgery followed by the administration of sirolimus in addition to reduced course of sclerotherapy.

### Non-invasive prenatal testing results, nuchal translucency size, and second trimester resolution modify first trimester cystic hygroma outcomes [^98f6d76b]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Medium credibility.

Objectives

The aim of our study was to describe outcomes of fetuses with cystic hygromas (CH) based on results of non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), nuchal translucency (NT) size, and spontaneous hygroma regression.

Methods

This was a retrospective cohort study of all patients with a CH diagnosed on first trimester ultrasound at our institution over a 9-year period. The primary outcomes were pathogenic genetic abnormalities, structural malformations and perinatal loss. Secondary outcomes included pregnancy termination, live birth, and a composite of primary outcomes.

Results

Of 294 fetuses with CH, 184 (64%) had a genetic abnormality, and among the fetuses with no known genetic diagnosis, 26 (25%) had at least one structural anomaly. Low risk NIPT result was associated with a 19% (13/71) residual risk of aneuploidy, copy number variant, or other pathogenic genetic finding and the frequency of all adverse outcomes rose with increasing NT size. Finally, of 31 cases of expectantly managed CH cases that resolved in the second trimester, only 4 (13%) had a genetic abnormality.

Conclusion

NIPT results, nuchal translucency size, and early resolution are modifiers in the outcomes associated with CH in the first trimester.

### Prenatal diagnosis of noonan syndrome in a set of monozygotic twins-a case report [^bc526f63]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Cystic hygroma (CH) is a rare benign cystic lymphatic lesion; nearly three-quarters of CH cases occur in the head and neck. The incidence of CH is estimated to be 1 case per 1000–6000 live births. Approximately 50% of CH cases are caused by a chromosomal aneuploidy, such as trisomy 21/13/18 and Turner syndrome. Noonan syndrome (NS, OMIM number:163,950) is the major cause of CH with single gene disorder. Most cases are sporadic, but can be inherited in an autosomal-dominant manner, affecting males and females equally. This syndrome is characterized by dysmorphic facies, short stature, webbed neck, lymphatic abnormalities, skeletal deformities, bleeding, diatheses, renal diseases, variable intellectual disabilities, and a group of cardiac anomalies. Prenatal ultrasound and molecular genetic test have enhanced the prenatal diagnosis of NS. Here, we report a pair of dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) twin pregnancies affected by NS with a novel mutation of LZTR1 detected by ultrasonography and WES analysis.

### Population-based study of the outcome following the prenatal diagnosis of cystic hygroma [^cbeaae05]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2005). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify the population prevalence, pregnancy outcome, and the pattern of associated anomalies with a prenatal diagnosis of cystic hygroma.

Design

We analysed the pregnancy outcomes from 99 cases of prenatally diagnosed cystic hygroma reported to the Trent Congenital Anomalies Register from 1 January 1997 to 31 December 1999, by means of an outcome reporting form completed by the notifying centre.

Results

We identified a population prevalence of 1 in 1775 livebirths for prenatally diagnosed cystic hygroma. There were 64 terminations of pregnancy, 19 spontaneous pregnancy failures, and 16 livebirths. Of the 87 pregnancies karyotyped, 53 (61%) demonstrated aneuploidy with Turner syndrome being the most common, 29 (33%). There were a large variety of structural malformations identified, however, only 14 out of 83 terminations of pregnancy and spontaneous pregnancy failures had post-mortem examinations. Termination of pregnancy for Turner syndrome not complicated by identified structural malformations was the norm. Of the 16 livebirths, only 6 were normal at birth, 1 other has had successful hygroma surgery. Four of the liveborn infants have since died.

Conclusions

The 'normal outcome' rate from pregnancies complicated by prenatally diagnosed cystic hygroma is less than 10% in this study (6/99). Prenatal diagnosis of cystic hygroma requires careful assessment of the fetus, with regard to both karyotyping and ultrasound. Post-mortem examination should be encouraged after termination of pregnancy, or spontaneous pregnancy loss. This is important not just to the current pregnancy but also for future pregnancies.

### Magnetic resonance imaging in the prenatal diagnosis of neural tube defects [^a5931ce5]. Insights Into Imaging (2013). Low credibility.

The differential diagnosis for encephalocele is based on the size, content and location of the lesion. The main differential diagnosis for encephaloceles located in the occipital region is with cystic hygroma, whereas for those located in the frontal region, the differential diagnosis is with teratoma and haemangioma of the scalp. Both teratomas and haemangiomas of the scalp are shown as slightly heterogeneous but well-defined solid masses with variable signal intensity; haemangiomas may have areas of signal voiding due to their intense vascularisation.

An encephalocele may form part of a syndrome like Meckel-Gruber syndrome and it can be associated with other anomalies like ventriculomegaly, spina bifida (7–15% of all encephaloceles), microcephaly, or cleft lip and/or cleft palate.

The prognosis depends on the size, location and extent of the lesion as well as on whether other anomalies are present.

### Familial occurrence of isolated nonseptated nuchal cystic hygromata in midtrimester of pregnancy [^261a812f]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

Nonseptated cystic hygromata of the fetal neck in midtrimester of pregnancy have been associated with chromosomal and structural malformations. Consequently, fetal karyotyping is frequently offered. We describe 18 families in which 18 pairs of siblings were affected by transient nonseptated cystic hygromata in utero.

Methods

Over a seven-year period, 18 families came to our attention, with a recurrent diagnosis of fetal nonseptated cystic hygromata in two subsequent pregnancies. Detailed anatomic surveys by transvaginal ultrasound were performed between 14 to 16 weeks' gestation on the basis of self-referral. Sonographic markers for fetal aneuploidy were specifically looked for. Nonseptated cystic hygroma was diagnosed when unilateral or bilateral cystic dilations in the anterolateral aspect of the fetal neck were present, as described by Bronshtein et al. (1989). All patients underwent amniocentesis, fetal echocardiography, and transabdominal follow-up ultrasound scan at 22 to 24 weeks' gestation.

Results

Thirty-six sibling fetuses with isolated nonseptated hygromata (unilateral n = 5; bilateral n = 31) were identified. Amniocentesis revealed normal karyotypes in all 36 fetuses, including 20 males and 16 females. Fetal echocardiograms and neonatal pediatric examinations were normal. Sonographic resolution of the cystic hygromata was noted in all cases at the 22 to 24 weeks' follow-up scan. One pregnancy, producing a female newborn, was conceived by a remarried mother. All others were reportedly conceived by the same partners. Probability calculations suggest that if our findings were explained by chance alone, a population base of 367,000 pregnancies would have to be scanned in order to find 18 pairs of siblings with nonseptated cystic hygromata.

Conclusion

The familial occurrence and identical natural history of the cystic lesions in utero suggest the presence of an inheritable developmental syndrome affecting the lymphatic system in utero, but without long-term sequelae.

### Intracranial dural venous anomalies in familial cervical cystic hygroma [^ec48b385]. Pediatric Neurology (2005). Low credibility.

This report describes a 3-year-old male with a familial cervical cystic hygroma and intracranial dural venous abnormalities consisting of a falcine sinus between the superior sagittal and the straight sinus with a rudimentary posterior part of the superior sagittal sinus; a prominent occipital sinus with narrowed transverse sinuses; and no intraparenchymal vascular abnormality. We hypothesize that a genetic factor that resulted in familial cervical cystic hygromas may also have caused the intracranial dural venous anomalies.

### Prenatal diagnosis of multiple pterygium syndrome associated with Klinefelter syndrome [^22f6774f]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2003). Low credibility.

A nonlethal form of multiple pterygium syndrome (MPS) was diagnosed prenatally at 16 weeks of gestation with associated Klinefelter syndrome in the same fetus. The ultrasound findings were cystic hygroma, hypertelorism, micrognathia, low-set ears, flexion contractures of upper and lower extremities and rocker-bottom foot. Genetic amniocentesis revealed a 47,XXY karyotype. After genetic counseling, the parents decided to have a therapeutic abortion. We presented this case for the purpose of further describing the early ultrasound findings and clinical features of multiple pterygium syndromes. Also, what makes our patient unique is the coincidental presence of Klinefelter syndrome with MPS. To our knowledge, this is the first case in the literature in which a 47,XXY karyotype has been found in a fetus with multiple pterygium syndrome. The importance of delineating the exact subtype of MPS and making a precise differential diagnosis becomes critical during the process of evaluation of patients with MPS.

1 Cumhuriyet University School Of Medicine, Department Of Radiology, Sivas (Turkey); 2 Cumhuriyet University Hospital, Department Of Pediatric Surgery, Sivas (Turkey); 3 Cumhuriyet University Hospital, Department Of Cardiovascular Surgery, Sivas (Turkey)

Purpose-Objective. Lymphatic malformations (LM) are rare, often presenting as congenital abnormal growth of lymphatic vessels diagnosed most commonly in the pediatric population. Venous anomalies are rarely seen with cystic hygromas. In this exhibit, we present the MDCT and MDCT- angiography findings in an unusual case of phlebectasia of persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC) accompanying that of lymphatic malformation.

Material and methods. A 6-week-old full-term male was brought to the emergency department with a 2-week history of progressive left neck swelling and tenderness. On examination, the left lateral neck was notable for an 8 × 6 cm soft mass that transiently expanded with crying. Multimodality imaging evaluation of the neck and thorax showed multiloculated cystic lesions on the left side of the neck spreading through the soft tissues. MDCT and MDCT-angiography examinations were performed with low radiation dose techniques.

Results. Multidedector computed tomography (MDCT) examination reveals location and extent of the cystic hygroma and a PLSVC connected with dilated coronary sinus.

Discussion and conclusions. Due to different MDCT post-processing techniques, even complex vascular malformations are visualized in an understandable way even for preoperative planning. Knowledge of venous anomalies may be helpful to the surgeon planning resection of a cystic hygroma.

### First and second trimester evaluation of risk for fetal aneuploidy: the secondary outcomes of the FASTER trial [^e7e2caa7]. Seminars in Perinatology (2005). Low credibility.

The FASTER Trial was a multicenter National Institute of Child Health and Human Development sponsored study of Down syndrome screening in a large unselected obstetric population using first and second trimester maternal serum markers and first trimester nuchal translucency sonography. The following paper will describe the FASTER Trial. It will review the outcomes of pregnancies complicated by cystic hygroma and the FASTER Trial's findings regarding first trimester nasal bone ultrasonography and screening for aneuploidy. Although the study's first and foremost goal was to compare various first and second trimester methods of screening for Down syndrome, the FASTER Trial has revealed a wealth of information not only on screening for aneuploidy but also on other obstetric issues.

### MRI imaging of fetal neck masses with airway compromise: utility in delivery planning [^4b49d0e9]. Pediatric Radiology (2001). Low credibility.

We present two cases of fetal neck masses that were initially diagnosed by ultrasound and further evaluated with prenatal MRI. MRI findings aided in further delineating the neck masses, increasing confidence in the final diagnosis (cervical teratoma and cystic hygroma). With the fetal airway typically filled with fluid that is of high signal on T2-weighted sequences, MRI images in three planes could identify whether the fetal larynx and trachea were partially or completely compressed by the neck tumor. This information was particularly useful in determining if a controlled delivery such as ex utero intrapartum treatment (EXIT) was necessary and aided the surgeons in planning their approach to establishing airway control in the delivery room.

### Karyotype and outcome of fetuses diagnosed with cystic hygroma in the first trimester in relation to nuchal translucency thickness [^9a0fc290]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2006). Low credibility.

Objectives

To determine the incidence and to examine the karyotype and the outcome of fetuses diagnosed with cystic hygroma (CH) at 11-14 weeks of gestation.

Methods

The presence of bilateral cystic anechoic cavities in the neck, nuchal translucency (NT), malformations and hydrops was prospectively recorded in 6894 ultrasound examinations in the first trimester, between 2001 and 2004.

Results

Forty-two fetuses (0.62%) were diagnosed with CH in the first trimester of pregnancy and 60% of these had an abnormal karyotype. NT was > or = 3 mm in 83% and hydrops was present in 40% of the cases. The karyotype was abnormal in 25 (69%) of these, showing trisomy 18 and 45,XO more often than trisomy 21. NT was <3 mm in seven cases (17%); no hydrops was present and only one had an abnormal karyotype (47 + 18). Eight babies with CH without aneuploidy or hydrops were born alive, seven among them were without malformations and are developing normally at 1 to 18 months of age, the remaining one presented with CHARGE syndrome.

Conclusions

CH is an independent entity from NT and its association with increased NT carries a poor prognosis.

### Post-auricular teratoma in an HIV-exposed newborn [^be3231bb]. BMJ Case Reports (2023). High credibility.

Discussion

Diagnosis of congenital teratoma is usually established by prenatal ultrasound.Postnatal imaging with ultrasound, CT scan or MRI provides useful information for surgical intervention. Teratomatous swellings are benign at first, non-tender and can cause erosion in the surrounding bone area.Clinically, a cystic teratoma may be confused with lymphatic vascular malformation as some of the features such as the location, size and progression of the tumour are similar.In our case, the infant had an unusual appearance, lobulated, cystic superiorly and firm inferiorly. The differential diagnosis of cystic hygroma and haemangioma was made. It has been reported that complex heterogenous areas appearing in the mass raise suspicion for malignancy and should be evaluated sooner.

Early confirmation of the teratoma is needed for proper management. A radiological investigation usually shows calcifications to confirm a diagnosis of congenital teratoma.Although a neonatal tumour may be histologically benign, these tumours may be life-threatening if they are large and compressing a vital organ. In our case, the cranial ultrasound revealed Arnold–Chiari malformation grade 1 due to the mass effect of the tumour.

Arteriovenous shunting and intratumoral haemorrhage due to a ruptured tumour can cause severe anaemia and infection.Our patient had a severe infection for which a blood culture was not done. Empirical antibiotics were given, and a major challenge was the appropriateness of antibiotics due to the unavailability of blood culture tests. Complete surgical excision is the treatment of choice for neonatal teratomas.

Histologically, teratomas can be cystic, solid or both, and contain tissues of different origins. They may contain immature or mature tissues.Mature teratoma is the most common type of teratoma.Our patient had both cystic and solid components with mature tissue.

The recurrence rates of mature teratomas, immature teratomas and malignant teratomas are 0–26%, 12–55% and 0–36%, respectively. The prevalence of this malignant transformation (mature cystic teratoma) is estimated at 1–2% of cases. Left untreated, lesions are associated with a high mortality rate (80%) and a high malignant transformation rate.An early complete surgical approach allows a good result with low complication and recurrence rates. It has been reported that the prognosis of congenital teratoma is determined if the tumour is completely resected where the chance of recurrence is minimal.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of detailed diagnostic obstetric ultrasound examinations between 12 Weeks 0 Days and 13 Weeks 6 Days [^d6850b28]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2021). High credibility.

Fetal neck and nuchal translucency—The fetal neck should be evaluated for cystic hygroma, dilated jugular lymphatic sacs, or other abnormal fluid collections or masses in an axial or coronal view; the nuchal translucency should be evaluated and subjectively assessed in the midsagittal view, with a precise measurement required when it appears thickened or as part of a screening protocol for aneuploidy risk assessment; a quality assessment program is recommended to ensure that false-positive and false-negative results are kept to a minimum.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the care of girls and women with Turner syndrome [^bbd0f6bb]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Turner syndrome—skin, nails, and lymphatic system management includes routine dermatologic surveillance and supportive lymphedema care. R 7.19 states, “We recommend annual skin assessment to identify compromising lymphedema, dermatitis, infections, autoimmune skin conditions, and skin neoplasms, with appropriate evaluation and treatment by a dermatologist if indicated,” and R 7.20 states, “We suggest the use of compression garments, massage therapists, and referral to specialists in lymphedema care for any compromising lymphedema.” Clinically apparent lymphedema occurs in 12%-27% of girls and women with TS, clinical lymphedema is often present at birth and frequently resolves or at least reduces by age 2 years, and lymphedema may be more often in association with a 45,X karyotype compared to other karyotypes. Referral to lymphatic specialists can be useful for persistent lymphedema, and though treatment typically leads to only temporary improvement, it may help prevent skin breakdown, ulceration, and infection. Currently, there are no recommended surgical or pharmaceutical therapies for treatment of lymphedema in the context of TS, fetal lymphedema may present as cystic hygroma and hydrops fetalis with increased risk for spontaneous fetal demise, and central lymphedema may contribute to congenital heart anomalies in TS as well as webbed neck (pterygium colli).

### How useful is nuchal translucency in detecting chromosomal abnormalities missed by genome-wide NIPT and what measurement threshold should be used? [^6559dfba]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Medium credibility.

3.3 NT Measurement in Relation to Genetic Abnormalities Not Detected by NIPT

The majority of late first trimester ultrasounds in the study period were performed in the 7 days around 13 weeks of gestation. Across the 12.5–13.5 weeks gestational age window, the NT measurement representing 1.6 MoM ranged from 2.8 to 3.2 mm and for 1.9 MoM was 3.3–3.8 mm. Across the 11–14 weeks range, the mean 95th centile NT measurement was 2.6 mm (1.35 MoM) and the mean 99th centile was 3.1 mm (1.65 MoM), as detailed in Supplementary Table 2.

NT measurement and 13‐week fetal structural assessment were performed in 33 cases where NIPT failed to detect a single or dual genetic abnormality (as not all cases missed by NIPT had a 13 weeks scan) (Supplementary Table 3). The “missed cases”, both with and without fetal structural anomalies, are plotted against various threshold NT values (1.6 MoM, 1.9 MoM, 3.0 and 3.5 mm) in Figure 1. The number of genetic abnormalities undetected by NIPT above each NT cut‐off, the proportion of the pregnant population and associated PPVs are detailed in Table 3.

FIGURE 1 
Scatterplot of nuchal translucency (NT) measurements in 33 false negative NIPT cases that also had a 13‐week scan, both with and without a fetal structural abnormality*, in relation to the suggested NT cut‐off values of 3.0 mm, 3.5 mm, 1.6 MoM and 1.9 MoM. This includes 30 cases with a single genetic abnormality and 3 cases with a multiple genetic abnormality. * Cystic hygroma, absent nasal bone and generalized edema were not considered as structural anomalies. Isolated = cases with no fetal structural anomaly seen at the late first trimester ultrasound; MoM = multiples of the median; NIPT = non‐invasive prenatal testing; Structural = cases with a fetal structural anomaly detected at the late first trimester ultrasound. The 95th centile NT measurement for the 13th week of gestation corresponds to 2.6 mm or 1.35 MoM, and the 99th centile to 3.1 mm or 1.65 MoM.

c according to Sonek et al. 2003;

d defined as head circumference < 5. Percentile

e described only as “typical facial appearance” or “greek helmet facial profile”

A somewhat beaked and triangular shape of the tip of the fetal nose came to our attention (even in the first trimester, Fig. 1 c), which, if present, might further raise the suspicion of WHS. Not least, assessment of the fetal ears by prenatal ultrasound should take place in suspected WHS cases, since deformities of the ears and/or preauricular tags are quite common and could also be seen in the one survivor of our cohort.

We found cardiac defects in 50% of our cases, which is consistent with postnatal findings, but has not been reported before in such a high frequency in prenatal series (24.6%, n = 16/65). The same applies to the presence of SUA, which was seen in 44.4% in our cases, compared to 4.6% (n = 3/65). Novel ultrasound findings in our cohort include aberrant right subclavian artery (ARSA, n = 3/18), right aortic arch (RAA, n = 2/18) and overlapping fingers (n = 2/18). One fetus presented with persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous (Fig. 1 d).

Abnormal first trimester ultrasound (increased NT or cystic hygroma) has been reported in WHS [,–] and some authors suggest FISH and/or CMA for WHS testing if routine karyotyping shows normal results. Most cases in our study presented during second trimester, which is consistent with the literature. The average gestational age at which intrauterine growth retardation typically manifest has not been specifically determined yet, but was not reported before 16 weeks’, so far.

### AIUM practice parameter for the performance of selected ultrasound-guided procedures [^2a8ab614]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2016). Medium credibility.

AIUM practice parameter—indications for ultrasound guidance state that image guidance is generally indicated for percutaneous soft tissue sampling or ablative procedures to ensure accurate needle or device placement, avoid unnecessary contamination of adjacent tissue compartments, optimize the diagnostic yield, accurately deliver ablative/therapeutic agents, and/or minimize complications; specific indications include fine needle aspiration for sampling accessible thyroid and parathyroid nodules, lymph nodes, cysts, salivary glands, congenital cervical mass lesions, muscle, soft tissue masses, and abscesses of the head and neck region, with samples that may be submitted for cytology, flow cytometry, hormone analysis (thyroglobulin, calcitonin, parathormone, and amylase), genetic and molecular markers, and cultures of infectious lesions; core biopsy is indicated for lymph nodes suspicious for lymphoma and aggressive thyroid lesions, and fine-needle aspiration for cytology, often with flow cytometry when lymphoma is suspected, should precede consideration of core biopsy, while when results are equivocal or suggest a Hodgkin lymphoma is suspected, a tissue sample is required with core biopsy as a first step before open biopsy; for breast lesions, most breast surgeons and radiologists prefer to perform core breast sampling as an initial assessment rather than fine-needle aspiration with cytology; additional uses include percutaneous ethanol injection of thyroid cysts, selected metastatic papillary carcinoma in lymph nodes, and specific hyperparathyroid conditions, noting that except for thyroid cysts, which have a very low complication rate, ethanol injections for other conditions are highly specialized and should be reserved for centers with specific interest and experience in these treatments, and sclerosing agents to treat macrocystic lymphangiomas and cystic hygromas.

### Postnatal management and outcome for fetal-diagnosed intra-cerebral cystic masses and tumours [^67923a86]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2009). Low credibility.

The increasing availability and resolution of non-invasive prenatal imaging has increased our ability to diagnose accurately a wide variety of fetal anomalies. It has also resulted in the serendipitous discovery of 'lesions' that may have little clinical impact upon the child's subsequent development although their ability to raise parental anxiety can be great. The purpose of this review is to put the postnatal clinical relevance of some of these findings into their proper context.

### Novel mutations in PIEZO1 cause an autosomal recessive generalized lymphatic dysplasia with non-immune hydrops fetalis [^dfec62f8]. Nature Communications (2015). Medium credibility.

Typically, haematology results for DHS patients show evidence of mild to moderate haemolysis, with normal or reduced haemoglobin and reticulocytosis, with variable numbers of stomatocytes seen on the blood film. Hyperkalaemia is often recorded if there is a significant delay between venesection and analysis. On close inspection, haematological analysis in our GLD cases show evidence of a mild, asymptomatic haemolytic anaemia with more subtle changes than that seen in DHS, and with no documented pseudohyperkalaemia, although the number of cases is too small to clearly link genotype and phenotype. It is not clear why red cells adopt a stomatocytic shape in conjunction with increased cation leak, and the spherocytes seen in one family (GLD4) are likely to also be due to the PIEZO1 mutation, and suggest that some cases of spherocytosis could be caused by mutations in this gene.

Disorders of the lymphatic system have an important role in the cause of NIHF, and 15% of NIHF cases are reported to be due to lymphatic dysplasia. The NIHF in our GLD cases is clearly related to a lymphatic phenotype, many of the neonates had evidence of chylothoraces and presented in childhood with lymphoedema and an abnormal lymphoscintigraphy. The hydrops in the DHS cases are reported to be unrelated to anaemiaand therefore not of a haematologic origin. Instead, we suspect it is highly likely to be lymphatic in origin and a case with severe generalized oedema and cystic hygromas, suggesting a lymphatic origin has been reported.

Interestingly, the variants identified in this cohort cause a mild form of DHS in affected individuals and carriers but biallelic variants have a high incidence of NIHF (7 of the 10 affected cases). This may be lethal in the perinatal period (n= 2). Survivors may present later with lymphoedema of the peripheries (mainly lower limbs but also arms (n= 4), face (n= 3) and genitalia (n= 1)), with or without chylothoraces (n= 2) and intestinal lymphangiectasia (n= 1). The recurrence of lymphatic problems in childhood observed in our GLD patients is comparable to that seen in Turner syndrome. Four patients of our cohort had severe, recurrent facial cellulitis with significant morbidity (high pyrexia and frequent admission to intensive care).

### Treatment of cystic hygroma in a young infant through multidisciplinary approach involving sirolimus, sclerotherapy, and debulking surgery [^5970f79b]. JAAD Case Reports (2016). Low credibility.

The patient underwent 4 sclerotherapy sessions with a 1-week period between sessions a week after his birth. The sclerosing agents used include alcohol, polidocanol, and doxycycline. He then underwent debulking surgery for the cystic hygroma and gastrostomy to facilitate the administration of sirolimus. Subsequently, he underwent one more sclerotherapy session for a total of 5 sclerotherapy sessions. The cystic hygroma persisted and the veins within the tumor became sclerosed and hence difficult for injection; therefore, sclerotherapy was no longer an option for management. He was then started on sirolimus when he was 1 month old with an initial dose of 0.07 mg/kg given twice daily through gastrostomy tube. Sirolimus level was monitored and maintained within a range of (0.004–0.01 mg/kg). Ten days after starting sirolimus, MRI showed visual 70% to 80% improvement (about 74–110 mL). Follow-up ultrasound scans showed a decrease in the cystic components of the hygroma mass. After the administration of sirolimus for 15 months, the size of the tumor decreased to 90% of its original size before treatment, leaving a residual of 10 to 20 mL with a 79- to 110-mL reduction of original volume of 370 mL of cysts that were in the cheek, temple, and tongue that were not treated with sirolimus (Fig 2, Fig 3, Fig 4, Fig 5, Fig 6, Fig 7, Fig 8). The patient had laryngomalacia because of the mass effect of the cystic hygroma that compromised the airway. He is a potential candidate for future plastic surgeries to remove redundant skin.

### Screening for congenital heart disease: a move toward earlier echocardiography [^0a78a427]. American Journal of Perinatology (2007). Low credibility.

Fetal echocardiography remains the mainstay for diagnosis in those pregnancies identified to be at risk for congenital heart disease (CHD). Prenatal diagnosis of CHD remains essential to provide families with thorough pregnancy options as well as allow for transfer to facilities experienced in the management of pediatric cardiac disease in cases of ongoing pregnancy. First-trimester and early second-trimester fetal echocardiography is now feasible and will be increasingly in demand as enlarged nuchal translucency and first-trimester cystic hygroma are becoming common indications for early fetal echocardiography. Although the reported performance characteristics of early fetal echocardiography are good, the technique should be viewed as an adjunct to mid-trimester echocardiography, with its biggest benefit likely to be the ability to provide earlier reassurance to couples at risk for CHD. Early fetal echocardiograms should be reserved for patients at risk for CHD and be performed in centers experienced in this technique.

### A characteristic cluster of fetal sonographic markers that are predictive of fetal Turner syndrome in early pregnancy [^560314c7]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this study was to describe a characteristic cluster of sonographic features of fetuses with Turner syndrome in early pregnancy.

Study Design

A targeted transvaginal ultrasound examination of all fetal organs was performed for 40123 consecutive pregnant women at 14 to 16 weeks of gestation. Both low- and high-risk pregnancies were included. Fetal karyotyping was performed in 9348 cases. The main indications were major fetal anomalies, advanced maternal age, abnormal biochemical markers, maternal anxiety, and request.

Results

Turner syndrome was detected in 13 fetuses (0.03%, 1/3086 early pregnancies). Huge septated cystic hygroma, severe subcutaneous edema, and hydrops were observed in all cases. A short femur was detected in 12 of 13 fetuses. A narrow aortic arch was visualized in all 8 fetuses who were scanned after 1995, when scanning of the aortic arch became mandatory in our institution. Four other fetuses had three or four of the five markers, 2 of the fetuses had trisomy 21, 1 fetus was normal, and one case of missed abortion occurred without a karyotype.

Conclusion

A reliable diagnosis of Turner syndrome by sonographic means is possible in early pregnancy.

### Antenatal pulmonary hypoplasia expands the variety of phenotypes associated with MED12-related disorders [^e7c512ea]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2025). Medium credibility.

1.4 Pregnancy Outcome

Fetal echocardiogram performed at 24 + 2 weeks gestation showed a structurally normal albeit right‐shifted heart. Fetal MRI at 24 + 4 weeks (see Figure 1A–D) showed microcephaly with dolichocephalic and turricephalic changes and significantly reduced extra axial CSF space, bilateral cleft lip and palate, cystic hygroma, highly unusual thoracic appearance with herniation of liver and stomach into thoracic cavity, lung volume 11% of expected and low signal intensity suggesting pulmonary hypoplasia (absence of lower trachea and bifurcation). The severity of the lung hypoplasia in this fetus was almost certainly incompatible with ex utero life and the parents made the difficult decision to proceed with feticide and termination of pregnancy at 26 + 4 weeks gestation. As this variant was de novo, the parents were counseled that the recurrence risk was low.

FIGURE 1 
A–D: Fetal MRI images. Figure 1A is a coronal plane view of the head and brain showing turricephalic head (i) and significantly reduced extra axial CSF space (ii). Figure 1B is a sagittal plane view. The two views demonstrate a right shifted heart (iii) and liver herniation into the chest cavity (iv). Hypoplastic lung (v) due to the herniating liver is shown in Figure 1B. Figure 1C is an axial view of the fetal head demonstrating a cleft palate (vi). Figure 1D is an axial view of the fetal neck and inferior head displaying the cystic hygroma (vii).

1.5 Discussion

Some of the features observed in this case overlap with other MED12 ‐related disorders rather than Hardikar syndrome, including skull abnormalities (dolichocephaly and turricephaly) and microcephaly. It is unclear whether these disorders are simply spectrum or distinct allelic disorders. To the best of our knowledge, pulmonary hypoplasia has not been previously reported in postnatal cases with MED12 variants. However, diaphragmatic hernia is a previously reported finding in Hardikar syndrome and pulmonary hypoplasia secondary to diaphragmatic aplasia has been reported in a female fetus with a MED12 loss of function variant. Therefore, this finding provides further evidence for inclusion of pulmonary hypoplasia as part of the MED12 ‐phenotypic spectrum.

This case demonstrates the challenges of determining the likely postnatal phenotype from a prenatal finding of a germline pathogenic variant in the MED12 gene due to the large range of potential phenotypic outcomes. It also provides further evidence to expand the phenotypic spectrum of MED12 ‐related disorders to include pulmonary hypoplasia.

### Imaging of cardiovascular risk in patients with Turner's syndrome [^feb98c6e]. Clinical Radiology (2015). Low credibility.

Introduction

Turner's syndrome (TS) or Ullrich–Turner's syndrome is a disorder defined by an absent or structurally abnormal second X chromosome and affects around 1 in 2000 newborn females.The variable phenotypes can be split into three main categories: monosomy X karyotype (45,X) (in 36–45%); mosaic karyotype (44–54%); and an isochromosome Xq, (5–11%).Short stature, gonadal dysgenesis, and congenital cardiovascular defects are common features of TS.Congenital heart defects, such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome and/or hypoplastic aortas, are the major causes of prenatal mortality.The foetuses with less severe cardiovascular defects survive the first trimester and can be recognised by in-utero ultrasound by hydrops of the trunk and limbs, large and loculated cystic hygromas of the posterolateral neck, pleural effusions, and ascites.When these resolve they leave the postnatal webbing of the neck (pterygium colli), puffy hands and feet, or redundant nuchal skin, making the diagnosis possible in 20–30% of newborn girls with TS.Around one-third are diagnosed in mid-childhood on the investigation of short stature and broad chest. In most other patients, who have milder signs and symptoms of TS, the condition is diagnosed due to delayed or absent pubertal development secondary to gonadal dysgenesis either in adolescence or in adulthood.The most common cardiovascular defects in surviving TS patients are bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) and aortic coarctation. These patients are also at increased risk for hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, and atherosclerosis.

The age-specific death rate in TS is around three-times higher than in the general female population with Fig 1 tabulating the relative standardised mortality ratios (SMRs).Cardiovascular disease accounts for 41% of excess deaths and the relative risk is most markedly elevated with cardiovascular congenital anomalies; in particular BAV and aortic aneurysm.The risk of acquired aortic dissection is increased by up to 100-fold and can occur in TS patients as young as 16–18 years.

The above highlights the need for appropriate cardiovascular risk stratification in TS patients. In the UK and some other countries, dedicated TS clinics have been established where teams of paediatric endocrinologists, gynaecologists, cardiologists, radiologists, and hypertension specialists are implementing appropriate screening and management strategies.The aim of this paper is to review the role of clinical imaging in TS cardiovascular risk stratification.

### Biallelicloss-of-function causes severe early-onset non-immune hydrops fetalis [^a26ab0f9]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Hydrops fetalis is a pathological accumulation of fluid in two or more body compartments.This aetiologically heterogeneous condition is caused by increased interstitial fluid production or decreased lymphatic return,and may result in increased nuchal translucency, lymphatic malformations (eg, cystic hygroma), subcutaneous fluid accumulation, pleural/pericardial effusion, ascites and placental thickening.

Historically, red cell allo-immunisation was the major cause of hydrops fetalis. Today, non-immune hydrops fetalis (NIHF; Mendelian Inheritance in Man, MIM: 236750) constitutes approximately 90% of cases.The estimated prevalence of hydrops fetalis ranges from 1:1500 to 1:4000 births.Early onset and aetiology are prognostic predictors in NIHF. Presentation in the first trimester increases the likelihood of a fetal aneuploidy. In a prenatal series of more than 12 000 pregnancies, almost half of 66 NIHF cases were attributed to a chromosomal abnormality.Aneuploidy conferred an extremely poor prognosis.In liveborn infants with NIHF, neonatal mortality is as high as 60%.

Bellini et al presented a classification scheme for NIHF based on underlying mechanism, including chromosomal imbalance, infection, placental abnormality, twin-to-twin transfusion, cardiovascular disorders, syndromes and lymphatic dysplasia. In an update, they classified 19.8% of cases as idiopathic.In a recent review including only cases meeting the strict criteria for NIHF, the aetiology was identified in 86.3%.The most prevalent aetiologies in the study by Laterre et al were chromosomal imbalance (33 of 102; 32.4%), lymphatic dysplasia (14 of 102; 13.7%) and cardiovascular disorders (10 of 102; 9.8%). The authors also developed a flow chart outlining a systematic diagnostic approach that emphasises the importance of next-generation sequencing (NGS).

### Biallelicloss-of-function causes severe early-onset non-immune hydrops fetalis [^b63af69f]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

Phenotype in the affected fetuses

This family demonstrates uniquely the natural course of complete LOF of ANGPT2 in humans. With one exception, the affected pregnancies were not terminated, but monitored until fetal demise. All three affected fetuses, for which a nuchal translucency measurement in the first trimester was available (III-5, III-7 and III-8), showed increased values, approaching what is seen in nuchal lymphatic malformations (cystic hygromas). Progression of hydrops was gradual from increased nuchal translucency to cystic hygroma, extensive subcutaneous fluid accumulation, hydrothorax, and lastly ascites, with intrauterine death occurring between weeks 14 and 27. The significantly, but transiently, increased nuchal translucency in a heterozygous unaffected fetus (III-9) underscores the importance of repeated ultrasounds in the context of increased nuchal translucency of unknown cause. We noted no specific feature that distinguishes ANGPT2 -related hydrops from other forms of NIHF.

Additional phenotypic features in the homozygous fetuses

Fetus III-4 had tetralogy of Fallot and fetus III-5 had a structurally normal heart. Two fetuses (III-7 and III-8) died too early to allow thorough assessment of cardiac anatomy. In a large cohort of individuals with tetralogy of Fallot, there was no increased burden of rare variants in ANGPT2 (K Devriendt, MD, personal communication, December 2020). Thus, it is unclear whether congenital heart malformations are a feature of the homozygous ANGPT2 phenotype. WES of fetus III-4 did not reveal any other pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in genes known to be associated with tetralogy of Fallot.

Fetus III-5 revealed short long bones radiographically. This could have been due to general growth retardation via placental dysfunction or more specifically related to vascular/lymphatic abnormalities.

Fetus III-4 was probably growth retarded given the 2-week discrepancy between estimated due date based on last menstrual period versus sonographic estimation of gestational age. The length of the long bones was not commented on autopsy.

### Hygroma colli cysticum: prenatal diagnosis and prognosis [^33fd090a]. American Journal of Perinatology (2001). Low credibility.

The objective of this study is to analyze the prenatal management and prognostic factors of hygroma colli cysticum by using cytogenetic tests and sonographic morphological features. All cases with hygroma colli cysticum diagnosed and managed at our Prenatal Diagnostics Unit between January 96 and September 2000 were analyzed. Sonographic morphological features were divided in two groups; nonseptated (n = 18) and septated (n = 12) hygroma colli cysticum lesions were compared with fetal karyotype results and pregnancy outcome data. Statistical analysis was performed by Chi-square test and statistical significance was defined as p <0.05. In 5 years, 30 cases with hygroma colli cysticum were identified. Cytogenetic results were obtained from 23 (76.7%) cases (four chorionic villus sampling and 19 amniocentesis). Chromosomal abnormalities were present in 13 cases (56.5%). The most common chromosomal abnormality was Turner Syndrome (four cases, 17.4%) and Trisomy 18 (four cases, 17.4%). Pregnancy outcome data were available for 29 patients. Those fetuses with septated hygroma colli cysticum tended to have a worse fetal outcome, without statistical significance (p >0.05), compared with the nonseptated hygroma colli cysticum cases (75 vs. 61.1%, respectively). Fetal hygroma colli cysticum, either septated or not, carries high risks of aneuploidies and adverse fetal outcome. Recommended management includes karyotyping and if parents decide to continue the pregnancy ultrasound scan at 20 to 22 weeks' gestation is necessary, for excluding associated anomalies. At birth, if the cystic hygroma persists, it should be noted that a respiratory difficulty can happen and a pediatrician should standby as a precaution.

### First-trimester cystic hygroma: relationship of nuchal translucency thickness and outcomes [^b27d2563]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To estimate the relationship between nuchal translucency thickness and abnormal karyotype, major congenital anomaly, perinatal loss, and composite abnormal outcome in fetuses with first-trimester nuchal cystic hygroma.

Methods

We performed a retrospective cohort study of first-trimester fetuses with ultrasound-diagnosed nuchal cystic hygroma collected over a 10-year period.

Results

There were 944 first-trimester fetuses with nuchal cystic hygroma. A karyotype abnormality occurred in 54.9% (400 of 729) of fetuses. A major congenital anomaly occurred in 28.8% (61 of 212) of fetuses with a normal karyotype. Perinatal loss occurred in 39% (115 of 295) of fetuses not electively terminated. Overall, an abnormal outcome occurred in 86.6% (543 of 627) of fetuses. After adjusting for potential confounders, every 1-mm increase in nuchal translucency thickness increased the odds of an abnormal karyotype by 44% (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.29-1.60, P<.001), the odds of major congenital anomaly by 26% (adjusted OR 1.26, 95% CI, 1.08-1.47, P=.003), the odds of perinatal loss by 47% (adjusted OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.07-2.02, P=.019), and the odds of a composite abnormal outcome by 77% (adjusted OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.15-2.74, P=.01).

Conclusion

First-trimester nuchal cystic hygroma is associated with high rates of karyotype abnormality, major congenital anomaly, perinatal loss, and abnormal outcome. As the thickness of the nuchal translucency increases, the odds of abnormal karyotype, major congenital anomaly, perinatal loss, and abnormal outcome increase.

### Society for Maternal-fetal Medicine (SMFM) clinical guideline # 7: nonimmune hydrops fetalis [^dcdcf132]. American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology (2015). Medium credibility.

SMFM clinical guideline—chromosomal etiologies of nonimmune hydrops fetalis (NIHF) and diagnostic testing: Chromosomal abnormalities, particularly Turner syndrome (45,X) and Down syndrome (trisomy 21) are also common causes of NIHF, accounting for 13% in a large systematic review. Turner syndrome is associated with 50-80% of cases of cystic hygromas. Some such cases occur due to a transient abnormal myelopoiesis, a leukemic condition that occurs in about 10% of infants with Down syndrome. For these reasons, we recommend that NIHF is an indication for prenatal diagnosis with karyotype, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and/or chromosomal microarray analysis, even when severe anemia is present. Screening with noninvasive prenatal testing may detect some chromosomal causes but provides more limited information about possible genetic etiologies, and therefore we recommend diagnostic testing.

### Prenatal cardiac findings and 22q11.2 deletion syndrome: fetal detection and evaluation [^04dba318]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2024). Medium credibility.

1.6.1 | First trimester screening

In conjunction with other early gestation tests, women undergo fetal ultrasound before 14 weeks of gestation with increasing frequency and reasonable success.A systematic review suggests that early gestation scans of the heart have been able to identify 54%–72% of major CHD in non-high-risk and 80% in high-risk pregnancies with high specificity if imperfect sensitivity.Not surprisingly, single ventricle lesions were among those most readily identified (>60% sensitivity) though truncus arteriosus also appeared to be among those frequently identified (77% sensitivity). Lesions such as tetralogy of Fallot were understandably more difficult to diagnose (41% sensitivity), whereas common lesions such as ventricular septal defects were inconsistently identified (24% sensitivity). Thus, early gestation scans may detect some but by no means all fetuses at risk for 22q11.2DS by virtue of a commonly associated subtype of CHD.

In addition to CHD, other anomalies associated with 22q11.2DS can be identified by early gestation ultrasound. Thickened nuchal translucency (NT) is associated with chromosomal abnormalities, genetic syndromes, and an increased risk of CHD. The risk is greater if there is a cystic hygroma. In four retrospective prenatal studies of ultrasound findings in 22q11.2DS, a thickened NT was observed in 38/470 (8%) 22q11.2DS-affected pregnancies, with the frequency ranging from 5% to 19% in individual studies., However, a systematic review of CMA in fetuses with increased NT and normal karyotype found 0.66% had a 22q11.2 microdeletion.

Comprehensive first trimester ultrasound can identify a significant percentage of fetal malformations. Pruthi and colleaguesevaluated 765 women who had a detailed first trimester ultrasound, and found that early anatomy compared to birth outcome/autopsy sensitivity was 80.5% and specificity 93.1%. Endovaginal ultrasound may aid in obtaining appropriate images.3D endovaginal imaging may be especially valuable in evaluating the brain.

### Bi-allelic loss of function variants in SLC30A5 as cause of perinatal lethal cardiomyopathy [^0c354aff]. European Journal of Human Genetics (2021). Medium credibility.

Interestingly, in all studied cases hydrops fetalis/cystic hygroma occurred late in pregnancy, with a diagnosis being made as late as 20 weeks of gestation or even at birth, albeit regular sonographic controls. McCoy et al. even state that a hydrops fetalis is more likely to be caused by cardiothoracic abnormalities the later in the pregnancy the diagnosis was made. Cystic hygroma normally develops by the end of the 6th week of gestation but was not found for individual 2.1 on sonographic screenings before birth.

In conclusion, here we describe four individuals from two families with perinatal lethal cardiomyopathy, all of which have bi-allelic LoF variants in the zinc transporter SLC30A5. For the first time, we are able to link bi-allelic LoF variants in this gene with a human disease. Although the pathomechanisms are not yet understood, they seem to fit in the spectrum of zinc transporters. Further analyses are needed to investigate these mechanisms.

### The prevalence of prenatal sonographic findings in postnatal diagnostic exome sequencing performed for neurocognitive phenotypes: a cohort study [^8aaf8cfe]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2022). Medium credibility.

A major limitation for performing prenatal ES is that there are limited data regarding the prenatal presentation of many genetic syndromes. This creates a significant challenge when analyzing ES results in cases where findings that do not have a known prenatal phenotype are detected (incidental findings). The formation of large and updated databases targeted at providing information regarding specific fetal phenotypes such as elevated NT, abnormal amniotic fluid volume, abnormal prenatal growth and other prenatal phenotypes will help to establish better prenatal genotype/phenotype correlations and to have more confidence in the interpretation of ES findings.

Increased NT is considered a prenatal phenotype for which testing for a monogenic disorder using, for example, a RASopathy gene panel, should be considered. Two large studies of prenatal ES,included cases of increased NT. Recently, several scholars have assessed the yield of ES in cases of increased nuchal translucency. Sparks el al.reported a diagnostic yield of 31% in a cohort of 29 cases with cystic hygroma or NT above 3.5 mm, however, the diagnostic yield among the 15 isolated cases was only 7%. Yang et al.assessed the yield of a panel of 4200 clinically relevant disease‐causing genes in 73 fetuses with increased NT (≥3.5 mm) and found a disease‐causing variant in 4 cases. In 3 out of 4 cases structural anomalies on ultrasound were detected at mid pregnancy hence the diagnostic yield of isolated NT was 1.4%. In a larger cohort reported by Mellis et al.the diagnostic yield among 213 fetuses with increased NT ≥ 3.5 recruited to the Prenatal Assessment of Genomes and Exomes (PAGE) and Columbia fetal whole exome sequencing reported diagnostic variants was 22.2% for fetuses presenting with non‐isolated increased NT. The yield was higher (32.4%) for fetuses with isolated increased NT in the first trimester and additional abnormalities later in pregnancy, but was only 1.8% in 111 fetuses with no other abnormalities on subsequent scans. The authors concluded that the diagnostic yield of prenatal ES is low for fetuses with isolated increased NT but significantly higher where there are additional structural anomalies. In our cohort, increased NT was present in seven patients, including three in whom it was the only sonographic anomaly and one case where the only other findings was an echogenic focus in fetal heart. Interestingly, none of the genes implicated in these cases are included in current RASopathy gene panels. This may suggest that ES should be offered as a more comprehensive approach to couples opting to perform additional genetic work‐up for pregnancies with elevated NT following normal CMA results.

### Prenatal DNA diagnosis of noonan syndrome in a fetus with massive hygroma colli, pleural effusion and ascites [^4243f743]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2005). Low credibility.

Prenatal molecular genetic diagnosis for Noonan syndrome I is reported. Noonan syndrome was suspected because of large cystic hygroma colli, massive pleural effusion and ascites at 23 weeks of gestation and normal karyotype (46,XX). DNA was prepared from amnion cells and screened for mutations in the PTPN11 gene. In exon 8, a missense mutation (S285F) was found. Delivery was induced at 33 weeks of gestation because of silent cardiotocography (CTG). Despite immediate drainage of the hydrothorax, mechanical ventilation was insufficient and the child died 9 h after birth due to severe pulmonary hypoplasia. Pleural punctate was enriched for small lymphocytes and thus was characterized as chylus. Prenatal ultrasound findings in Noonan syndrome usually are unspecific and rarely lead to a diagnosis. However, with the combination of cystic hygroma, pleural effusion, ascites and normal karyotype Noonan syndrome should be considered and DNA testing for PTPN11 mutations may be appropriate. Malformations of lymphatic vessels and/or chylothorax in Noonan syndrome seem to be more frequent than usually anticipated.

### Cystic diseases of childhood: a review [^575b4796]. Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Renal cystic lesions are considered the most common abnormality associated with the kidneys. Most renal cysts are usually uncomplicated simple cysts that are not life-threatening; however, fatal renal cystic diseases can develop from these space-occupying lesions. Although renal cystic diseases are similar in presentation, they possess distinct features, variable prognoses, and complications later in life. Early identification and effective management of these respected diseases has led to longer survival rates and better quality of life. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive analysis of the most prevalent cystic diseases of the pediatric population in hopes to aid in early distinction and appropriate treatment.

### Prenatal sonographic diagnosis of the 49, XXXXY syndrome [^bec438a4]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2002). Low credibility.

The 49,XXXXY syndrome is a rare sex chromosome anomaly with an approximate incidence of 1 in 85,000 male live births. The diagnosis is usually ascertained postnatally by the association of mental retardation, variable growth deficiency, Down syndrome-like facial dysmorphy, hypogenitalism and other malformations, especially involving the heart and skeleton. Prenatal diagnosis of the pentasomy 49,XXXXY is generally fortuitous and sonographic features have rarely been described in the literature. We report here on two cases of 49,XXXXY syndrome diagnosed prenatally because of sonographic abnormalities. In the first, amniocentesis was performed at 26 weeks' gestation for polyhydramnios, unilateral clubfoot and micropenis. In the second, a karyotype was carried out on chorionic villi at 13 weeks' gestation for cystic hygroma. These observations and the six previously reported cases demonstrate that cystic hygroma in first or second trimester of pregnancy may be associated with sex chromosome aneuploidy other than Turner syndrome. Moreover, they emphasize the importance of detailed sonographic examination in the second trimester, as small penis and abnormal posturing of the lower extremities are very suggestive of the 49,XXXXY syndrome.

### Acitretin [^8c4791bb]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

♦  Females who have taken TEGISON (etretinate) must continue to follow the contraceptive recommendations for TEGISON. TEGISON is no longer marketed in the US; for information, call Alembic Pharmaceuticals Limited at 1-866-210-9797. ♦  Patients should not donate blood during and for at least 3 years following the completion of therapy with acitretin because women of childbearing potential must not receive blood from patients being treated with acitretin.

Important Information for Males Taking Acitretin: Patients should not donate blood during and for at least 3 years following therapy with acitretin because women of childbearing potential must not receive blood from patients being treated with acitretin.

• Samples of seminal fluid from 3 male patients treated with acitretin and 6 male patient treated with etretinate have been assayed for the presence of acitretin. The maximum concentration of acitretin observed in the seminal fluid of these men was 12.5 ng per mL. Assuming an ejaculate volume of 10 mL, the amount of drug transferred in semen would be 125 ng, which is 1/200,000 of a single 25-mg capsule. Thus, although it appears that residual acitretin in seminal fluid poses little, if any, risk to a fetus while a male patient is taking the drug or after it is discontinued, the no-effect limit for teratogenicity is unknown and there is no registry for birth defects associated with acitretin. The available data are as follows:

There have been 25 cases of reported conception when the male partner was taking acitretin. The pregnancy outcome is known in 13 of these 25 cases. Of these, 9 reports were retrospective and 4 were prospective (meaning the pregnancy was reported prior to knowledge of the outcome) .

aFour of 5 cases were prospective

bWith malformation pattern not typical of retinoid embryopathy (bilateral cystic hygromas of neck. hypoplasia of lungs bilateral. VSD with overriding truncus arteriosus).

For All Patients : AN ACITRETIN MEDICATION GUIDE MUST BE GIVEN TO THE PATIENT EACH TIME ACITRETIN IS DISPENSED, AS REQUIRED BY LAW.

### Umbilical vein insertion into the inferior vena cava: an ominous sign of chromosomal abnormalities? [^e47c63bb]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2014). Low credibility.

This series describes the sonographic characteristics and pregnancy outcomes of fetuses with abnormal insertion of the umbilical vein (UV) into the inferior vena cava (IVC). We conducted a retrospective study that described the sonographic features of 6 patients who underwent a routine anatomic scan during early pregnancy. Six patients had a diagnosis of abnormal insertion of the UV to the IVC; in 3, the diagnosis was made at 12 weeks' gestation. Cardiac anomalies were detected in 3 patients, including ventricular septal defects, pericardial effusion, tricuspid and mitral regurgitation, and an aberrant right subclavian artery. Four had noncardiac anomalies, including cystic hygroma and skeletal, brain, and abdominal anomalies. Only 1 fetus who presented with UV insertion into the IVC as an isolated finding had a normal karyotype, resulting in term vaginal delivery. Four other patients had chromosomal abnormalities, including trisomies 13 and 21, Turner mosaicism of 45,XO/46,XY, and Robertsonian translocation, and 1 patient terminated the pregnancy without a karyotype evaluation. Abnormal insertion of the UV into the IVC with agenesis of the ductus venosus can be seen as early as the first trimester. When detected, a detailed anatomic examination should be performed, as well as a fetal karyotype evaluation. Isolated cases of insertion of the UV into the IVC at a position lower than usual may have a good prognosis.

### Mesenchymal hamartoma: prenatal diagnosis by MRI [^428d29ad]. Pediatric Radiology (2011). Low credibility.

The clinical presentation of thoracic mesenchymal hamartomas varies from an asymptomatic chest wall mass to severe respiratory distress resulting from compression of the airways and lungs. We present the findings on fetal US and MRI of a histologically confirmed case. Following surgical resection, pathological examination corresponded to the cross-sectional imaging features with haemorrhagic, cystic and calcified components. An awareness of the characteristic imaging findings will allow accurate diagnosis of this condition, even prenatally, and thus facilitate appropriate perinatal management and surgical planning.

### Congenital and hereditary cystic diseases of the abdomen [^cdf9dd45]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Key Points

The detection of incidental cystic lesions may cause diagnostic confusion in patients having a history of cancer.
Some syndromes predisposing the affected individual to different tumors may cause cystic lesions in the abdominal organs and rarely, the tumors can be cystic.
Correct diagnosis of the benign cystic lesions is critical as they may simulate several other benign and malignant acquired diseases of the abdomen, all of which have very different treatment approaches and prognostic implications.

### Biallelicloss-of-function causes severe early-onset non-immune hydrops fetalis [^307ec8cb]. Journal of Medical Genetics (2023). Medium credibility.

The mother’s first pregnancy ended in an early miscarriage (III-1).

The couple has a healthy daughter (III-2) born following a normal pregnancy in which an ultrasound at 11+2 weeks was reported as normal, although nuchal translucency was not assessed. She is now school-aged and there is no suspicion of oedema anamnestically.

The third pregnancy resulted in a miscarriage (III-3) at 9 weeks.

In the fifth pregnancy, severe hydrops including a large nuchal cyst was detected at 12 weeks in the female fetus (III-5). Results of rapid testing for trisomy 13, 18 and 21 and chromosomal microarray on DNA extracted from a chorionic villus biopsy were normal. The hydrops progressed and the couple was informed of a poor prognosis, including the risk of maternal mirror syndrome. Fetal demise occurred at 27 weeks (figure 2). Autopsy revealed severe hydrops with hydrothorax, hypoplastic lungs, a bell-shaped thorax, short long bones and a hydropic placenta.

Figure 2 
Photograph of a fetus (III-5) with intrauterine death at 27 gestational weeks. Note the severe subcutaneous oedemas, deformed facial features and large cystic hygroma of the neck. Created by the authors.

The sixth pregnancy ended in a termination (III-6) after detection of a blighted ovum at 10+4 weeks.

The seventh pregnancy was terminated (III-7) at 15 weeks after detection of severe subcutaneous oedema and a cystic hygroma at 12+4 weeks. Rapid aneuploidy testing was normal. Chromosomal microarray was normal and demonstrated homozygosity stretches in common with fetuses III-4 and III-5, in keeping with parental consanguinity.

The eighth pregnancy ended in a miscarriage (III-8) at 14–15 weeks following detection of increased nuchal translucency (week 11+0, 3.7 mm, >99th centile) and severe generalised subcutaneous fluid accumulation.

### A prospective study on rapid exome sequencing as a diagnostic test for multiple congenital anomalies on fetal ultrasound [^74f91443]. Prenatal Diagnosis (2020). Medium credibility.

Recognizing the fetal phenotype on ultrasound is challenging. Ultrasound images are a digital representation of the anatomy of the fetus, and not every anomaly will be detected by ultrasound, with dysmorphic features being especially difficult to identify. For example, for rES diagnostics, we excluded established fetal anomaly associations without a known genetic background, such as limb body wall complex; however, this diagnosis was made postmortem in one fetus in our cohort.

Detailed information on the phenotype is still essential for accurate interpretation of genetic data. Uncertainty about the fetal phenotype and lack of knowledge on the fetal phenotype in relation to disease‐causing genes are possible, but unavoidable, obstacles to correct data interpretation. 23 On the other hand, suspected diagnoses might turn out to be false. For example, the expected diagnosis in Case 3 was Joubert syndrome based on the combination of cerebellar anomalies seen in this fetus, including suspected molar tooth sign and hydronephrosis, and the cerebellar anomalies, cystic hygroma, echogenic kidneys, and talipes seen in a previous fetus of the parents. However, rES established a homozygous pathogenic variant in PEX1 (OMIM 602136), which is known to cause Zellweger syndrome (OMIM 214100). Cerebellar anomalies are a rare feature of Zellweger syndrome, while the other features of the syndrome did match the fetal phenotype. This case shows the value of using broad virtual gene panels rather than specific gene panels like that used for ciliopathies. Not only do we lack knowledge about the prenatal phenotype of disease‐causing genes, variants in genes that cause lethal phenotypes in the embryonic, fetal, or perinatal period may have escaped detection until now. Increased use of ES in the prenatal period will probably reveal more of these lethal variants. Indeed, Meier et al (2019) identified new disease genes in a cohort of severely affected fetuses. 24
