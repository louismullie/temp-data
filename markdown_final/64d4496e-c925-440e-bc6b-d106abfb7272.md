## Question

32 years old male complain of acute onset of testicular pain for the past two days. What question would u ask for a thorough HPI?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what questions should be asked to obtain a thorough history of present illness (HPI) in a 32-year-old man with acute testicular pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the immediate priority of excluding testicular torsion. Then, I should verify the key historical discriminators that separate torsion from epididymitis and other causes. Next, I will review associated symptoms and risk factors that modify pretest probability. After that, I need to check for atypical or referred pain presentations that can mislead. Finally, I will synthesize the highest-yield questions and outline next steps in management and imaging, ensuring I anchor each point to guidelines and evidence.

> Let me first confirm the emergency hierarchy: in any acute scrotum, testicular torsion must be excluded immediately because salvage drops sharply with time, with the best outcomes when detorsion occurs within about 6 hours and substantial risk of orchiectomy after 12–24 hours, so I should not delay for imaging if the clinical picture is compelling [^116LJ873] [^114b3aAa] [^112wv5Pn].

> Wait, let me verify the pain chronology because this is the most critical discriminator: torsion typically presents with sudden, severe, unilateral pain as if "a switch was flipped", whereas epididymitis tends to evolve gradually over days. I should ask exactly when the pain started, whether it was abrupt, and whether there were any prior similar episodes suggesting intermittent torsion, since recurrent severe pain with spontaneous resolution raises suspicion for intermittent torsion and a bell-clapper deformity [^113DBVti] [^116kcTH5] [^115VZdpr].

> Hold on, I should verify associated symptoms that heighten suspicion for torsion: nausea and vomiting are common with torsion due to shared innervation, and abdominal or groin pain can be the primary complaint, especially in younger patients or when the testis is high-riding. Importantly, atypical presentations with abdominal pain are linked to delayed diagnosis and higher orchiectomy rates, so I must ask explicitly about nausea, vomiting, and any abdominal or flank pain even if the scrotum looks deceptively quiet [^116qaPCh] [^113mMoaE] [^114d667P].

> I need to check urinary and sexual symptoms to separate infectious epididymitis from torsion: dysuria, frequency, urgency, urethral discharge, or recent unprotected sex push toward epididymitis, whereas a normal urinalysis is common in torsion. I should also ask about recent urinary tract instrumentation or catheterization, which increases risk for enteric epididymitis, and remember that epididymitis can be STI-related or non-STI depending on age and risk factors [^116MHJiF] [^112uAxv1] [^116A69y7].

> Let me consider trauma and activity because this can mislead: recent scrotal trauma or strenuous activity can precipitate torsion or cause testicular injury, but trauma does not exclude torsion. I should ask about any direct blow, sports, or lifting, and clarify whether pain began immediately after trauma or was already present, since torsion can occur during sleep or exertion and may be misattributed to trauma [^116amKYx] [^113DBVti] [^111MfkcX].

> I should confirm systemic features and fever, but interpret them carefully: fever favors epididymitis or orchitis, yet torsion can produce low-grade fever from inflammatory mediators, so fever alone is not discriminatory. I will ask about chills, malaise, and any measured temperature, and correlate with the rest of the history to avoid anchoring bias [^116A69y7] [^111MfkcX].

> But wait, what if the pain is actually referred or due to a non-scrotal source? I need to check for red flags suggesting vascular or retroperitoneal causes: bilateral testicular pain radiating to the back or flank, especially in older adults or those with risk factors, should prompt consideration of abdominal aortic aneurysm or retroperitoneal pathology. Isolated testicular pain has been reported as a presenting symptom of symptomatic or leaking AAA, so I should ask about cardiovascular risk factors and any abdominal or back pain [^11699nTq] [^112Rs5VY] [^113jvdsg].

> Next, I should review past medical and surgical history that modifies risk: prior torsion or intermittent torsion episodes, cryptorchidism or orchiopexy, recent inguinal or scrotal surgery, and vasectomy can all influence presentation and management. Cryptorchid testes have a markedly higher torsion risk and can present with inguinal or abdominal pain rather than scrotal pain, so I must ask about testicular descent history and any prior scrotal operations [^111MfkcX] [^114W26v6] [^114y6j6w].

> Let me synthesize the highest-yield questions I would ask now, and I should double-check that each maps to a key diagnostic branch: when exactly did the pain start and was it sudden; where is the pain now and has it moved to the abdomen or groin; is there nausea or vomiting; any urinary symptoms or discharge; any recent trauma or strenuous activity; any prior similar episodes; any fever or chills; any testicular surgery, undescended testis, or vasectomy; and any cardiovascular risk factors or abdominal/back pain suggesting AAA. These questions directly target torsion versus epididymitis versus referred pain pathways [^116LJ873] [^116MHJiF] [^11699nTq].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about imaging. I should confirm the next steps based on pretest probability: if the story is classic for torsion (sudden severe pain with nausea and high-riding testis), I should proceed to immediate urologic consultation and surgical exploration without ultrasound delay. If the diagnosis is uncertain or symptoms have been present beyond 12 hours, scrotal Doppler ultrasound is appropriate, but I must remember that preserved or even increased arterial flow does not exclude torsion, particularly in partial or intermittent torsion, so a negative scan cannot safely rule out torsion when suspicion remains [^116LJ873] [^113DBVti] [^116qaPCh] [^1136iTTF].

> I should double-check supportive bedside maneuvers and exam features that refine risk: the cremasteric reflex is often absent in torsion and may be preserved in epididymitis, though it is imperfect. The testis may lie higher and transversely in torsion. Prehn's sign is unreliable. And I should be cautious interpreting any single sign in isolation and integrate the entire clinical picture before deciding on exploration versus imaging [^116LJ873] [^112R1AC5] [^113DBVti].

> Let me reconsider the time window one more time to ensure urgency is clear: while salvage is best within 6 hours, meaningful salvage can still occur up to 12–24 hours in some cases, but delays beyond this markedly increase orchiectomy risk. Therefore, any suggestion of torsion mandates emergent urology involvement and readiness for the operating room, with simultaneous preparation for ultrasound only if it will not delay care [^116LJ873] [^112wv5Pn] [^114b3aAa].

> Finally, I need to ensure I have addressed the differential beyond torsion and epididymitis: torsion of the testicular appendage, incarcerated hernia, Fournier gangrene, testicular trauma with rupture, and testicular tumor with hemorrhage all remain on the table and should be kept in mind as the history and exam unfold, but in a 32-year-old with acute pain, torsion and epididymitis are the leading concerns and must be prioritized in questioning and management planning [^114CB4wZ] [^114j2S3K] [^114b3aAa].

For a 32-year-old male with acute testicular pain, the most critical question is: "Did the pain start suddenly, is it severe, and is it associated with nausea or vomiting?" This triad strongly suggests testicular torsion, a surgical emergency requiring **immediate intervention** [^116LJ873] [^116qaPCh]. Also ask about **urinary symptoms** (dysuria, frequency, urgency, discharge) to distinguish epididymitis, and screen for trauma, recent strenuous activity, or similar prior episodes to assess torsion or intermittent torsion risk [^111CkCfm] [^113DBVti] [^111MfkcX] [^115VZdpr]. Confirm the exact time of onset, as delays beyond 6–12 hours reduce salvage rates [^116LJ873] [^112wv5Pn].

---

## Pain characteristics

- **Onset**: Sudden vs gradual; sudden onset favors torsion [^114b3aAa] [^116qaPCh].
- **Severity**: Severe pain with nausea/vomiting suggests torsion [^116LJ873] [^116qaPCh].
- **Location**: Unilateral vs bilateral; unilateral pain is common in torsion and epididymitis [^116MHJiF].
- **Radiation**: Groin, abdomen, or flank radiation can occur in torsion [^113mMoaE].
- **Progression**: Constant vs intermittent; intermittent pain suggests intermittent torsion [^116kcTH5].

---

## Associated symptoms

Ask about **nausea and vomiting**, which are common in torsion [^116LJ873] [^116qaPCh]. Screen for **urinary symptoms** — dysuria, frequency, urgency, or discharge — that suggest epididymitis [^111CkCfm]. Ask about **fever or chills**, which are more suggestive of infection than torsion [^111CkCfm]. Also inquire about **scrotal swelling, erythema, or skin changes**, which can occur in both torsion and infection [^113DBVti].

---

## Precipitating factors

Ask about **recent trauma or strenuous activity**, which can precipitate torsion or injury [^111MfkcX]. Inquire about **prior similar episodes**, which raise suspicion for intermittent torsion [^116kcTH5]. Review **recent sexual activity** and STI risk, as these increase the likelihood of epididymitis [^116MHJiF].

---

## Medical and surgical history

Review **past medical history** for urologic conditions, hernias, or cryptorchidism [^111MfkcX]. Ask about **previous scrotal or inguinal surgery**, including vasectomy or hernia repair [^114y6j6w]. Confirm **current medications**, as some can increase torsion risk or mimic pain [^111sei5q].

---

## Social and occupational history

Ask about **occupational hazards** or activities that may cause trauma or strain. Review **sexual history** for STI risk and recent partners [^111wpGVD]. Assess **alcohol, tobacco, and drug use**, which may influence risk and management.

---

## Red flag symptoms requiring immediate attention

- **Sudden severe pain with nausea/vomiting**: Strongly suggests torsion [^116LJ873] [^116qaPCh].
- **High-riding testis with absent cremasteric reflex**: Classic torsion signs [^116LJ873] [^114b3aAa].
- **Delayed presentation (> 6–12 hours)**: Increases risk of testicular loss [^116LJ873] [^117L1kG2].

How to use the algorithm

Identify the symptoms by systematic history taking.
Examine the patient appropriately.
Use the algorithm to plan investigations for troublesome/severe symptoms.
Most patients have more than one symptom and so investigations need to be requested for each symptom.
Usually all investigations are ordered at the same time and the patient reviewed with all the results.
When investigations should be ordered sequentially, the algorithm indicates this by stating first line, second line, etc.
Treatment options are generally offered sequentially but clinical judgement should be used.

### Testicular pain as A warning symptom of a symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm: case report and review of the literature [^11699nTq]. Annals of Vascular Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Isolated testicular pain is an unusual clinical presentation of symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). We present two patients hemodynamically stable with an isolated acute testicular pain related to an AAA and a review of the published literature up to present.

Methods

Two adult-old males with an acute isolated testicular pain presented to the emergency department. Although both cases had their symptoms for more than 24 hours and were hemodynamically stable, the misdiagnosis of a urological condition in one case and a delay of the intervention in the second resulted in a sudden drop of vital signs and the need of an urgent open surgery.

Results

A bibliographic review of the 15 published cases is presented. Most cases occurred without a previous diagnosis of AAA. Aneurysms were characteristically very large (mean 10 cm). The initial diagnosis was frequently wrong, attributing the pain mostly to genito-urinary conditions. The testicular pain presented days and even weeks before rupture, which may offer a convenient window of hemodynamic stability for repair.

Conclusions

Acute testicular pain in adult-old patients with aneurysm risk factors and specially with a first urological evaluation discarding a genitourinary disorder should alert clinicians to consider the diagnosis of a symptomatic abdominal aortic aneurysm. The early and accurate recognition of these cases may increase the survival.

### Benign causes of testicular… [^116A69y7]. AAFP (1998). Low credibility.

Epididymis, Spermatic Cord and Vas Deferens Palpation should be performed to evaluate for induration and to localize pain to the testicle or adjacent structures. The epididymis is posterior to the testicle. The patient should perform the Valsalva maneuver while standing so he can be evaluated for a mass of dilated testicular veins in the spermatic cord forming a varicocele above and behind the testis. Inguinal Canals The inguinal canals should be explored for hernias or cord tenderness. Funiculitis, an inflammation of cord structures, may cause inguinal or scrotal pain, but the testis is normal. Evaluation for cord lipomas or hydroceles should also be performed. 2 An associated anatomic defect is usually not present on the contralateral side. 3 Clinical Presentation. Intravaginal testicular torsion occurs most often in young men but can also affect middle-aged men.

Patients with testicular torsion often present with sudden, severe, unilateral scrotal pain that is often associated with nausea and vomiting. 4 Scrotal edema and erythema are typically present, and lower abdominal pain may also occur. Physical examination reveals a tender, firm affected testis that may appear retracted upward as a result of twisting of the spermatic cord. Elevation of the scrotum without relief of pain is also said to indicate torsion, but this finding is unreliable. Urinalysis is normal in 90 percent of patients with testicular torsion, 6 whereas patients with epididymitis will likely have pyuria. Epididymitis Clinical Presentation. Epididymitis is the most common cause of painful swelling of the testis in postpubertal males. 9 A typical history for epididymitis is the gradual development of scrotal pain, with fever, urethral discharge and urinary symptoms. On physical examination, the epididymis is sensitive and may be enlarged and indurated.

Acute Orchitis Clinical Presentation. Acute orchitis presents with the sudden onset of testicular pain and high fever. Nausea and vomiting are also common. The testis is enlarged, indurated and tender on palpation. Proteinuria or hematuria may be present. Although many infectious agents can produce a primary infection in the testis, pyogenic bacteria and viruses are the causative agents in most cases.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^11285M1j]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Uncomplicated urinary tract infection (UTI) classifications — intended to guide treatment, not diagnosis — describe a clinical syndrome characterized by local bladder signs and symptoms such as dysuria, urgency, frequency, and suprapubic pain, and are defined by absence of findings suggesting infection beyond the bladder: no fever unless explained by a non-UTI cause, no other signs or symptoms of systemic illness (including chills, rigors, or unstable vital signs) unless explained by a non-UTI cause, no flank pain, and no costovertebral angle tenderness. Uncomplicated UTI can occur in females or males, patients with underlying urologic abnormalities, patients with immunocompromise, and persons with diabetes; recurrent UTI can be uncomplicated. Patients with urinary catheters (including transurethral, suprapubic, and intermittent catheterization), stents, and percutaneous nephrostomy tubes generally do not have uncomplicated UTI, and these guidelines are not intended to apply to bacterial prostatitis, epididymitis, or orchitis.

### Bilateral simultaneous testicular torsion presenting as a diagnostic dilemma [^117DNXoJ]. BMJ Case Reports (2013). Medium credibility.

Bilateral simultaneous testicular torsion is a rare condition and can be misdiagnosed. The 16-year-old patient presented with a 3 h history of left hemi-scrotal pain, nausea and vomiting. His comorbidities included DiGeorge syndrome (22q11 deletion syndrome). Patient's scrotal examination was misleading because both testes were retracted. His cremasteric reflex was negative bilaterally. Scrotal ultrasound findings were consistent with the diagnosis of the left testicular torsion. An examination under anaesthesia revealed high riding and oblique position of the left testicle, but the position of the right testicle was unremarkable. The patient underwent an emergency left hemiscrotal exploration and untwisting of the left testicle. The right hemi-scrotal exploration revealed a 540° clock-wise right testicular torsion. The case demonstrates the importance of bilateral hemi-scrotal exploration in a patient presenting with acute testicular pain due to a testicular torsion. Bilateral scrotal exploration is mandatory not only for diagnostic but also for treatment purposes.

Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) may present in a variety of ways, most commonly with joint pain or the distinctive palpable purpura. Genitourinary manifestations of HSP are less common and may precede the classic signs and symptoms of HSP, making the diagnosis difficult. We report a case of a 19-month-old boy with penile and scrotal erythema and swelling at presentation who was later diagnosed with HSP.

### A case of adult acute idiopathic scrotal edema [^113otnd3]. Nature Reviews: Urology (2009). Medium credibility.

Background

A 40-year-old man presented to a hospital emergency department with acute-onset, bilateral, painless swelling of the scrotum, which had developed progressively over the previous 12 h. He was physically well with no remarkable medical history, and was not taking any medication. He had no history of allergies or trauma (including insect bites to the genitalia), no urinary symptoms, and was not sexually active.

Investigations

Physical examination, assessment of erythrocyte sedimentation rate, white blood cell count, renal function panel, urine microscopic analysis, urine cultures, transillumination, and scrotal ultrasonography.

Diagnosis

Acute idiopathic scrotal edema.

Management

The patient received expectant management and treatment with an NSAID to relieve his inflammation. He was discharged from hospital and his symptoms resolved within 72 h of onset of treatment.

Patients and Methods

Patient and preoperative examinations

From February 2010 to June 2013, 14 patients, aged 12 to 24 years, with acute onset of scrotum pain were admitted to the urological center of Changhai Hospital, Shanghai, China. All patients had acute onset of pain in the hemiscrotum. No predisposing factors or fever was present in these patients. The longest time to admission was 10 hours following the onset of pain. On physical examination, the hemiscrotum was mildly to moderately congested and swollen, and the ipsilateral testis and epididymis were not palpable. All patients underwent urine and blood tests and color Doppler ultrasound. On Doppler imaging, the blood flow decreased in seven cases (including two "no flow" cases) and remained normal in the other seven cases (Table 1).

### Diagnosing chronic testicular pain… [^111wpGVD]. AAFP (2003). Low credibility.

Chronic testicular pain is unilateral or bilateral scrotal pain lasting for more than three months and interfering with normal activities. Because of the innervation of the scrotum, testicular pain may originate in the abdomen or testis. The cause of testicular pain may be difficult to determine. In approximately 25 percent of cases, an underlying cause for orchalgia cannot be identified. A review by Kapoor and Nargund stresses a systematic approach to the diagnosis of chronic testicular pain. The history should include questions concerning lower urinary tract and bowel symptoms, as well as a complete genitourinary and sexual history. The onset and nature of the pain can give important clues to diagnosis. Intermittent testicular torsion is characterized by recurrent episodes of severe pain that may be accompanied by nausea and systemic symptoms.

Varicocele-related pain is characteristically described as a persistent, aching discomfort or heavy sensation that is relieved by lying down. Although testicular tumors are usually described as painless, up to 40 percent of patients report dull aching or heaviness. Bleeding into a tumor or other abnormalities such as hydroceles, epididymal cysts, and spermatoceles can produce acute or severe pain. Testicular pain associated with chronic infection is usually associated with urinary symptoms or those of sexually transmitted diseases. Physical examination should include the entire genital area. Testicular examination should be conducted in both standing and lying positions. Areas of hyperesthesia should be noted and a search made for herniae. Rectal examination is necessary to assess rectal and prostate areas. Additional investigations depend on the most likely diagnosis. Ultrasound can be diagnostic for anatomic lesions.

Color Doppler ultrasonography is the best investigation for vascular lesions. Investigations of the upper urinary tract, such as intravenous urography and ultrasonography, may be appropriate for referred renal pain. The management of testicular lesions depends on the etiology. Patients should be cautioned that surgical treatment may not resolve pain. For cases where the etiology cannot be determined, ilioinguinal nerve block or microsurgical denervation may relieve the pain. Systemic analgesia or orchidectomy may be required in individual cases. In such extreme cases, psychologic consultation is recommended to ensure that the pain is neurologic and not psychogenic in origin.

Fournier gangrene — this variant of necrotizing soft tissue infection involves the scrotum and penis or vulva; the average age at onset is 50–60 years, and eighty percent of patients have significant underlying diseases, particularly diabetes mellitus; early features include fever, pain, erythema, and swelling of the genitalia, with progression to cutaneous necrosis and crepitus indicating gas in soft tissue; disease is usually limited to skin and subcutaneous tissue with testes, glans penis, and spermatic cord typically spared, may extend to the perineum and anterior abdominal wall, and most cases are caused by mixed aerobic and anaerobic flora, with Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas species sometimes present and S. aureus known to cause this infection as the sole pathogen; management requires prompt, aggressive surgical debridement to remove all necrotic tissue while sparing deeper structures when possible.

### Scrotal masses [^114CB4wZ]. American Family Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Scrotal and testicular masses can be broadly categorized into painful conditions, which include testicular torsion, torsion of the testicular appendage, and epididymitis, and painless conditions, which include hydrocele, varicocele, and testicular cancer. Testicular torsion is a urologic emergency requiring prompt surgical intervention to save the testicle, ideally within six hours of presentation when the salvage rate is about 90%. The Testicular Workup for Ischemia and Suspected Torsion score can be used to help physicians identify patients at high risk of torsion and those at lower risk who would benefit from imaging first. Torsion of the testicular appendage presents with gradual onset of superior unilateral pain, is diagnosed using ultrasonography, and is treated supportively with analgesics. Epididymitis is usually caused by infection with Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, or enteric bacteria and is treated with antibiotics, analgesics, and scrotal support. Hydroceles are generally asymptomatic and are managed supportively. Varicoceles are also generally asymptomatic but may be associated with reduced fertility. It is uncertain if surgical or radiologic treatment of varicoceles in subfertile men improves the rate of live births. Testicular cancer often presents as a unilateral, painless mass discovered incidentally. Ultrasonography is used to evaluate any suspicious masses, and surgical treatment is recommended for suspected cancerous masses.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® newly diagnosed palpable scrotal abnormality [^114Yknyv]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Palpable scrotal abnormalities are caused by a variety of disorders, ranging from indolent benign conditions to aggressive tumors, and infectious and vascular processes. In these patients the diagnostic workup typically begins with a complete clinical, history, and physical examinations, including analysis of risk factors. If imaging is required, ultrasound examination is the diagnostic modality of choice. In few select patients with very large scrotal masses, MRI may be appropriate. However, the use of gadolinium-based contrast should be evaluated critically depending on specific patient factors. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Diagnostic Considerations

Men who have acute epididymitis typically have unilateral testicular pain and tenderness, hydrocele, and palpable swelling of the epididymis. Although inflammation and swelling usually begin in the tail of the epididymis, it can spread to the rest of the epididymis and testicle. The spermatic cord is usually tender and swollen. Spermatic cord (testicular) torsion, a surgical emergency, should be considered in all cases; however, it occurs more frequently among adolescents and men without evidence of inflammation or infection. For men with severe unilateral pain with sudden onset, those whose test results do not support a diagnosis of urethritis or urinary tract infection, or for whom diagnosis of acute epididymitis is questionable, immediate referral to a urologist for evaluation for testicular torsion is vital because testicular viability might be compromised.

Bilateral symptoms should increase suspicion of other causes of testicular pain. Radionuclide scanning of the scrotum is the most accurate method for diagnosing epididymitis but it is not routinely available. Ultrasound should be used primarily for ruling out torsion of the spermatic cord in cases of acute, unilateral, painful scrotal swelling. However, because partial spermatic cord torsion can mimic epididymitis on scrotal ultrasound, differentiation between spermatic cord torsion and epididymitis when torsion is not ruled out by ultrasound should be made on the basis of clinical evaluation. Although ultrasound can demonstrate epididymal hyperemia and swelling associated with epididymitis, it provides minimal diagnostic usefulness for men with a clinical presentation consistent with epididymitis. A negative ultrasound does not rule out epididymitis and thus does not alter clinical management. Ultrasound should be reserved for men if torsion of the spermatic cord is suspected or for those with scrotal pain who cannot receive an accurate diagnosis by history, physical examination, and objective laboratory findings.

Testicular abscess

Testicular abscesses are usually a complication of bacterial epididymo-orchitis. In rare situations secondary infections of pre-existing hematomas or infarct areas have also been reported. US is generally the first imaging modality used for detecting and diagnosing these abscesses. On US, testicular abscesses typically appear as hypoechoic lesions with ill-defined "shaggy" walls (Fig. 7). The content of the abscess is mostly heterogeneous and some movement within this content on gentle compression with the probe may be detected on real-time imaging. Perilesional increased testicular vascularity is frequently observed on color Doppler imaging, and the absence of Doppler signal within the abscess content is a helpful diagnostic sign favoring an abscess over a neoplastic process (Fig. 8).

Clinical history and physical exam, apart from palpable left testicular mass, were unremarkable. a Color Doppler ultrasound image demonstrates a complex cystic mass with increased peripheral and mild central vascularity (arrows). b Postcontrast fat suppressed T1W axial plane image shows predominantly peripherally enhancing left testicular mass (arrows). Polymicrobial abscess was pathologically confirmed after orchiectomy. No obvious underlying risk factor could be discerned for testicular abscess

Abscesses with minimal cystic content may be difficult to differentiate from testicular neoplasms (Fig. 9). The differential diagnosis is further confounded by the propensity of some testicular cancers to undergo necrosis and cavitate, thus mimicking an abscess (Fig. 10). Relevant clinical history, presence of testicular pain, level of tumor markers and acute phase reactants may be helpful for correct diagnosis. On MRI, significant diffusion restriction and thick, irregular contrast-enhancing wall are typical features of abscesses regardless of the location. The absence of contrast enhancement within the lesion and the detection of perilesional hyperemia on contrast-enhanced MRI study may indicate an abscess. In selected patients, percutaneous fine needle aspiration biopsy or rarely even surgery may be indicated.

A 16-year-old boy attended the Emergency Department with sudden severe right iliac fossa pain and associated vomiting. He denied any urinary symptoms, diarrhoea or testicular pain. On examination, he had a locally tender right iliac fossa with guarding. External genitalia and testicular examination revealed an absent right testicle, the left testicle was not tender. The patient was haemodynamically stable. A clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis and possible testicular torsion was made and the patient sent for an urgent diagnostic laparoscopy. At laparoscopy, the patient was found to have a torted, non-viable right-sided testicle in the abdominal cavity. On discussion with urology, a decision was made to excise the torted testicle as it was atrophic and had significant malignant potential. The appendix was normal. The patient made an unremarkable recovery and was discharged.

Incidence of solicited local and general symptoms (any and grade 3 severity) during the 7-day period after each vaccine dose. Solicited local symptoms (injection site pain, redness, swelling) and general symptoms (fatigue, fever, gastrointestinal [eg, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain], headache, myalgia and sweating) symptoms were recorded on diary cards for 7 days after each vaccine dose. Symptom severity was graded on a scale of 1–3, with grade 3 symptoms defined as redness or swelling > 50 mm in diameter, fever > 39.0°C, and any other symptom preventing normal daily activities.

During the 30-day postvaccination period, 60.0%–84.0% of subjects in the F4/AS01 groups reported unsolicited symptoms, compared with 50.0%–70.0% in the F4/WFI groups. In the F4/AS01 groups, unsolicited symptoms (mainly chills and injection site reactions) were considered causally related to vaccination in 30.0%–44.0% of subjects and were of grade 3 severity in ≤ 10.0%. All related symptoms were transient and resolved without sequelae, generally within 2–3 days. Six serious adverse events were reported in the F4/AS01 groups, all considered unrelated to vaccination. No subjects died during the study period, and no subject withdrew because of adverse events.

### Diagnostic studies… [^113DBVti]. AAFP (1999). Low credibility.

Testicular pain or swelling, often referred to as the acute scrotum, can have a number of causes. Testicular torsion represents a surgical emergency because the likelihood of testicular salvage diminishes with the duration of torsion. Therefore, the family physician must act quickly to identify or exclude this condition in any patient who presents with an acute scrotum. This article reviews an approach to the diagnosis and treatment of the acute scrotum. The onset and duration of pain must be carefully determined. Testicular torsion usually begins abruptly, as if a switch has been flipped. The pain is severe, and the patient often appears uncomfortable. Moderate pain developing gradually over a few days is more suggestive of epididymitis or appendiceal torsion. With either of these conditions, the patient may appear relatively comfortable except when examined. A history of trauma does not exclude the diagnosis of testicular torsion.

Scrotal trauma incurred during sports activities or rough, boisterous play often causes severe pain of short duration. Pain that persists for more than one hour after scrotal trauma is not normal and merits investigation to rule out testicular rupture or acute torsion. Pain that resolves promptly after scrotal trauma only to recur gradually a few days later suggests traumatic epididymitis. The duration of symptoms is also relevant. A high-riding testis with an abnormal lie may suggest torsion, but this diagnosis is unlikely if pain has been present for over 12 hours and the scrotum has a normal appearance. In both epididymitis and testicular torsion, the affected hemiscrotum typically displays significant erythema and swelling after 24 hours. Color Doppler ultrasonography also correctly diagnosed incarcerated hernias, varicoceles, hematomas and testicular ruptures.

When the history and physical examination strongly suggest that testicular torsion is present and the duration of pain is less than 12 hours, urgent surgical intervention is indicated. No imaging studies are required because they may delay treatment and thereby jeopardize testicular survival. When pain has been present for more than 12 hours or the diagnosis is unclear, color Doppler ultrasound examination can be helpful in making clinical decisions. It is important to remember that most patients with an acute scrotum do not have testicular torsion.

### Efficacy and safety of 0.75% ropivacaine instillation into subinguinal wound in patients after bilateral microsurgical varicocelectomy: a bi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial [^117Uugty]. Journal of Pain Research (2017). Low credibility.

Introduction

Varicocele is an abnormal enlargement of the pampiniform venous plexus in the scrotum. The goal of varicocele treatment is to stop the backward flow of blood from the body to the scrotum. Microsurgical varicocelectomy could be considered in the patient who had suffered from severe testicular pain, marked discrepancy in testicular volume, and impaired spermatogenesis in spite of the controversies.–

Currently, the main methods employed for surgical repair of varicocele include microsurgical varicocelectomy, laparoscopic varicocelectomy, and radiological percutaneous embolization. Among various surgical methods, microsurgical varicocelectomy appears to be the optimal treatment in most cases. However, acute postoperative pain is common after microsurgical varicocelectomy.

Various methods including systemic analgesics and nerve block have been utilized to manage postoperative pain. Reducing pain after microsurgical varicocelectomy can be done using systemic analgesics. However, systemic analgesics such as opioids may have side effects such as nausea, vomiting, itching, respiratory problems, and sedation. They might lengthen the duration of postoperative ileus. There is a controversy regarding the application of a local anesthetic on the operative site after inguinal surgery to reduce postoperative pain. However, results from a meta-analysis of Wu et alhave shown that instilling a local anesthetic infusion pump following an inguinal hernia repair can reduce postoperative pain in comparison to the placebo group. To the best of our knowledge, no study has reported the effect of instilling a local anesthetic agent following microsurgical varicocelectomy. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare postoperative pain after bilateral microsurgical varicocelectomy by applying a local anesthetic agent on a unilateral operative site through a randomized and double-blind method.

### Bilateral external iliac artery pseudoaneurysms causing urinary obstruction and acute renal failure [^114kJPfj]. CVIR Endovascular (2022). Medium credibility.

Case presentation

A 29-year-old man presented to the emergency department with acute severe bilateral testicular pain radiating to the back. The pain initiated during the night, awakening the patient and prompting medical attention. He described the pain as sharp and continuous, radiating to his lower back bilaterally with no worsening or alleviating factors. The patient had no history of trauma, underlying medical conditions, regular medications, or previous surgical procedures. Abnormal urinary symptoms were also ruled out.

On admission, he was hypotensive (100/60 mmHg) with normal heart rate and normal neurological status. Physical examination revealed mild dehydration, pale mucous membranes, and cool extremities. Peripheral pulse was symmetric in the lower and upper limbs. No heart murmurs, signs of pulmonary congestion or pleural effusion were observed. On abdominal palpation, a lower abdominal mass was noted with mild discomfort. No signs of acute peritonitis were present. Testicular examination was unremarkable.

Anemia (hemoglobin level of 7.6 g/dL and hematocrit of 24%) and acute renal failure (creatinine of 2.8 g/dL, normal blood urea with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 29 mL/min/1.73 m²) were observed. Testicular tumor markers were negative. Abdominal ultrasound revealed a retroperitoneal mass causing bilateral ureterohydronephrosis. All imaging studies were normal.

Even in the setting of acute renal failure, contrast-enhanced multiaxial tomography of the abdomen and pelvis was deemed necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis. It revealed bilateral EIA pseudoaneurysms (Fig. 1 A) causing moderate bilateral ureterohydronephrosis (Fig. 1 B) with clear signs of contrast leakage from the right EIA pseudoaneurysm into the retroperitoneum, reflecting evidence of an acutely ruptured pseudoaneurysm associated with an ipsilateral retroperitoneal hematoma (Fig. 1 C). These findings supported acute anemia and renal failure.

### Testicular torsion: diagnosis, evaluation, and management [^116LJ873]. American Family Physician (2013). Low credibility.

Testicular torsion is a twisting of the spermatic cord and its contents and is a surgical emergency affecting 3.8 per 100,000 males younger than 18 years annually. It accounts for 10% to 15% of acute scrotal disease in children, and results in an orchiectomy rate of 42% in boys undergoing surgery for testicular torsion. Prompt recognition and treatment are necessary for testicular salvage, and torsion must be excluded in all patients who present with acute scrotum. Testicular torsion is a clinical diagnosis, and patients typically present with severe acute unilateral scrotal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Physical examination may reveal a high-riding testicle with an absent cremasteric reflex. If history and physical examination suggest torsion, immediate surgical exploration is indicated and should not be postponed to perform imaging studies. There is typically a four- to eight-hour window before permanent ischemic damage occurs. Delay in treatment may be associated with decreased fertility, or may necessitate orchiectomy.

### Unusual presentation of mixed germ cell tumour from testis in a 45-year-old man [^111sGwSf]. BMJ Case Reports (2011). Medium credibility.

Testicular cancer is a common neoplasm in young and middle-aged men. Although, the most common presentation is a palpable testicular mass, it can present with atypical symptoms. There is a lack of awareness among primary-care physicians about the less common presentations of testicular tumours. Early detection is a key prognostic variable. Fever, weight loss, sweating and pain in the abdomen for 4 months in an adult man has multiple differential diagnoses especially if epigastric mass is present. We are presenting an interesting case of fever, weight loss, pain and mass epigastrium and generalised lymphadenopathy which proved to be a testicular germ cell tumour without any testicular symptoms and with normal tumour markers.

### Epididymitis-STI treatment guidelines… [^116NtnRz]. CDC (2021). Medium credibility.

Epididymitis Acute epididymitis is a clinical syndrome causing pain, swelling, and inflammation of the epididymis and lasting < 6 weeks. Sometimes a testicle is also involved, a condition referred to as epididymo-orchitis. A high index of suspicion for spermatic cord torsion should be maintained among men who have a sudden onset of symptoms associated with epididymitis because this condition is a surgical emergency. Diagnostic Considerations Men who have acute epididymitis typically have unilateral testicular pain and tenderness, hydrocele, and palpable swelling of the epididymis. Although inflammation and swelling usually begin in the tail of the epididymis, it can spread to the rest of the epididymis and testicle. The spermatic cord is usually tender and swollen.

Spermatic cord torsion, a surgical emergency, should be considered in all cases; however, it occurs more frequently among adolescents and men without evidence of inflammation or infection. For men with severe unilateral pain with sudden onset, those whose test results do not support a diagnosis of urethritis or urinary tract infection, or for whom diagnosis of acute epididymitis is questionable, immediate referral to a urologist for evaluation for testicular torsion is vital because testicular viability might be compromised. A negative ultrasound does not rule out epididymitis and thus does not alter clinical management. Ultrasound should be reserved for men if torsion of the spermatic cord is suspected or for those with scrotal pain who cannot receive an accurate diagnosis by history, physical examination, and objective laboratory findings.

All suspected cases of acute epididymitis should be evaluated for objective evidence of inflammation by one of the following POC tests:

- Positive leukocyte esterase test on first-void urine.
- Microscopic examination of sediment from a spun first-void urine demonstrating ≥ 10 WBCs/HPF. All suspected cases of acute epididymitis should be tested for. Although the majority of men with acute epididymitis can be treated on an outpatient basis, referral to a specialist and hospitalization should be considered when severe pain or fever indicates other diagnoses or when men are unable to comply with an antimicrobial regimen. Age, history of diabetes, fever, and elevated C-reactive protein can indicate more severe disease requiring hospitalization (.

### Clinical risk factors for testicular torsion and a warning against falsely reassuring ultrasound scans: a 10-year single-centre experience [^116qaPCh]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

We sought to determine which demographic, clinical and ultrasonography characteristics are predictive of testicular torsion (TT) and to determine factors associated with time to treatment.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed all medical records of patients (0–17 years) with acute scrotal syndrome (ASS) who were treated in our hospital in Lithuania between 2011 and 2020. We extracted patients' demographic data, in-hospital time intervals, clinical, US and surgical findings. TT was determined at surgery or clinically after manual detorsion. Test characteristics of demographic, clinical and US findings for the diagnosis of TT versus other causes of ASS were determined. We performed a multivariate analysis to identify independent clinical predictors of torsion, and factors associated with surgical delay.

Results

A search of medical records yielded 555 cases: 196 (35%) patients with TT and 359 (65%) patients with other ASS causes. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age between 13 and 17 years (OR 8.39; 95% CI 5.12 to 13.76), duration of symptoms < 7hours (OR 3.41; 95% CI 2.03 to 5.72), palpated hard testis (OR 4.65; 95% CI 2.02 to 10.67), scrotal swelling (OR 2.37; 95% CI 1.31 to 4.30), nausea/vomiting (OR 4.37; 95% CI 2.03 to 9.43), abdominal pain (OR 2.38; 95% CI 1.27 to 4.45) were independent clinical predictors of TT. No testicular blood flow in Doppler US had a specificity of 98.2% and a positive predictive value of 94.6%. However, 75 (41.7%) patients with TT had normal testicular blood flow, yielding low sensitivity (58.3%) and negative predictive value of 81.3% for this US finding. In-hospital waiting time for surgery was longer in patients with TT with normal testicular blood flow by USS (195min) compared with no blood flow (123min), p < 0.01. Higher orchiectomy rates were associated with longer duration of symptoms (p < 0.001) and longer waiting time for USS (p = 0.029) but not with false-negative US.

Conclusions

Pubertal age, symptoms duration of < 7 hours, nausea/vomiting, palpated hard testis, abdominal pain and scrotal swelling are predictive factors for TT. Time lost between symptom onset and seeking medical care, and between arrival and US are associated with the need for orchiectomy. Preserved blood flow in USS does not rule out TT and may contribute to delays to surgery.

### Nonscrotal causes of acute scrotum [^116Jpxdx]. Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Acute scrotum is characterized by intense acute scrotal pain, which may be associated with other symptoms and signs such as abdominal pain, inflammation, and fever. Many pathologic conditions can present in this way, most which involve the scrotal contents. Nonscrotal conditions, however, can rarely present clinically only as acute scrotum: among them, renal colic, aneurysm rupture or other causes of retroperitoneal hemorrhage, primary abdominal or pelvic tumors and metastases, pancreatitis, pelvic inflammation, and muscle injuries. The pathophysiologic characteristics of the clinical presentation, clues for diagnosis, and imaging features of a series of nonscrotal lesions presenting clinically with acute scrotal pain are herein reported and illustrated. In patients presenting with acute scrotal symptoms and normal scrotal ultrasound findings, nonscrotal causes of acute scrotal pain should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Therefore, an ultrasound investigation of the abdomen, groin, and thighs is indicated.

### Factors determining testicular torsion and consequent orchiectomy in pediatric patients presenting with scrotal pain [^115xW4bP]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Medium credibility.

In this study, 24 (54.5%) children underwent TS and orchiopexy after 6 hours of SP onset, more than the 20% to 40% reported in previous studies. All these children with TT underwent TS and orchiopexy in the interval of 6 to 8.5 hours after the onset of SP. Nonspecific symptoms such as inguinal swelling and pain, scrotal swelling, abdominal pain, and nausea or vomiting might delay the management of TT beyond 6 hours. We attributed the good outcomes in our patients with TT to undergoing surgery shortly beyond 6 hours due to the good hospital access, comprehensive population coverage, and short waiting times, as well as prompt urology consultation.

Research has evaluated the predictors of TS in children with TT, and we identified several risk factors associated with orchiectomy in children with TT in a multivariate analysis, including a longer interval between SP onset and PED arrival, absent TUBF,– interval between SP onset and surgery of more than 24 hours, and a greater degree of TT.

Every patient with TT who needed an orchiectomy on 1 testis had an orchiopexy on the other testis to prevent TT, and preserve fertility and endocrine function. Preventive orchiopexy on the other testis seemed to be effective in our series.

This study reflects the need for parent and caregiver education regarding the importance of prompt evaluation of symptoms of SP across all ages and necessary treatment for TT. Because 72.7% of the SP cases occurred in boys aged 10 to 18 years, it makes sense to educate the families of boys about TT, which is an emergency condition. Not all TT presents with severe SP; the initial clinical presentation is variable, and includes inguinal swelling and pain, scrotal skin erythema or dark color, scrotal swelling, scrotal tenderness, a hard testis, and dysuria. This requires immediate evaluation until other kinds of acute scrotal pain are proven. –,

Limitations

First, this retrospective study relied on patient self-reporting, and the timing of their discomfort may not have been recorded accurately. Second, few infants and younger children had SP and TT in our study. More definitive risk factors for orchiectomy should be identified, and additional multicenter studies with larger cohorts are required to assess the factors associated with orchiectomy in pediatric patients with TT.

### Intermittent testicular torsion: diagnostic features and management outcomes [^116kcTH5]. The Journal of Urology (2005). Low credibility.

Purpose

Intermittent testicular torsion (ITT) is a poorly characterized condition but harbors potentially serious implications with regard to testicular viability. We report better characterization of the diagnostic features of ITT.

Materials and Methods

We performed a retrospective review of all patients 1 to 18 years old seen from 1997 to 2003 at our institution diagnosed with ITT. Patients with acute scrotal pain and spontaneous resolution who underwent bilateral testicular fixation were included in the study.

Results

A total of 50 patients meeting the inclusion criteria were identified with mean age at presentation of 12.2 years (range 4 to 17). The mean number of painful episodes before surgery was 4.3 (range 1 to 30). The most common presenting features were severe pain of rapid onset and resolution. Nausea and/or vomiting was reported in a quarter of the patients. Finding of a horizontal lie of the testes on examination was significantly associated (p < 0.05) with the existence of the bell-clapper deformity. All patients underwent surgical fixation of the testes. There were no postoperative complications. Of 38 patients (97%) for whom followup was available 37 had complete resolution of symptoms (mean followup 7.9 months).

Conclusions

ITT should be a diagnostic consideration in patients who present with recurrent acute scrotal pain with rapid spontaneous resolution. Recurrent severe pain with rapid onset and resolution seems to be highly characteristic. Horizontal lie on examination is highly correlated with the bell-clapper deformity at surgical exploration. Surgery may be recommended in these patients as it appears to result in pain relief in the majority, is likely to prevent future testicular infarction and is associated with low morbidity.

Regardless of age, any presentation of an acute scrotum requires prompt triage and immediate evaluation. The potential for significant reduction in morbidity and mortality exists if timely diagnosis and treatment are provided. Often overlooked, an early scrotal examination in the emergency department may produce the most accurate information into the underlying pathologic process, be it systemic or localized to the scrotum. Although the immediately lethal conditions presenting as acute scrotal pain should be considered, the combined incidence and morbidity associated with testicular torsion make its exclusion paramount in acute scrotal presentations. Similarly, a painless scrotal mass must be assumed to be a testicular neoplasm until proven otherwise, with appropriate work-up and rapid urologic follow-up assured.

Gastrointestinal symptoms

Forty patients (56%) had gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, with diarrhea or melena on few occasions. Children tended to have one or more of the above symptoms; 35 children (49%) had abdominal pain, 21 (30%) had vomiting, and 13 cases (18%) had gastrointestinal bleeding. There were no cases with intussusception.

Renal involvement

A total of 37 children (52%) (23 males and 14 females with ratio at 1.64:1) had signs of renal involvement, mostly onset within one month of appearance of rash. In 19 cases (27%), the renal involvement manifested within 15 days of appearance of the rash; in nine cases (13%) onset from 16 days and 1 month, in five cases (7%) between 1 and 3 months, in three cases (4%) between 3 months and 1 year, and in one case (1%) between 1 and 3 years. Renal involvement tended to manifest after skin symptoms. Proteinuria (11%) was detected in eight cases, hematuria in six cases (8%), concomitant hematuria and proteinuria in 13 cases (18%), acute nephritis in 31 cases (44%), nephrotic syndrome in 11 cases (15%), and chronic nephritis in two cases (3%).

Other symptoms were as follows. Leg edema was observed in 12 cases (17%), fever in seven cases (10%) (body temperature, 37.5 °C–38.7 °C). Five (7%) patients suffered from testicular swelling and pain. Orchitis and testicular torsion was excluded by ultrasound examination. Three cases (4%) had headache and dizziness. Cranial CT examination showed no abnormalities. In two cases, there were visible lung shadows which resolved after treatment.

### Male chronic pelvic pain: AUA guideline: part I evaluation and management approach [^115441zz]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Chronic pelvic pain in men — scrotal examination and ultrasound guidance: "Clinicians should perform a thorough scrotal examination in patients with chronic pelvic pain; a scrotal ultrasound may be performed. (Clinical Principle)". A comprehensive genital examination is essential and should include assessment of the scrotum and penis in both standing and supine positions with careful palpation of scrotal structures including testicles, epididymis, vas deferens, and spermatic cord; other causes of scrotal pain should be excluded. Scrotal ultrasound may not be necessary when a comprehensive examination is performed and the diagnosis is unambiguous. In a retrospective analysis of 7,668 scrotal ultrasounds, the majority (80.4%) revealed benign or normal findings, with only 2.2% indicating a necessity for surgery. Nevertheless, when clinical evaluation raises suspicion of an acute surgical pathology and the diagnosis is uncertain, expedient scrotal ultrasound imaging can serve as a useful tool for confirming diagnoses such as testicular mass or torsion.

### Testicular torsion with preserved flow: key sonographic features and value-added approach to diagnosis [^1136iTTF]. Pediatric Radiology (2018). Low credibility.

Complete torsion occurs when the testis twists 360° or greater, usually leading to absence of intratesticular flow on color Doppler exam; however sometimes the flow is preserved or decreased. Intermittent torsion is defined as sudden onset of unilateral testicular pain of short duration with spontaneous resolution. In partial or incomplete torsion, the degree of spermatic cord twist is less than 360°, allowing for some residual perfusion to the testis. However there is no spontaneous resolution of pain.

Testicular torsion has been reported to have a bimodal distribution, an initial peak in the first year of age where the torsion is of extravaginal type, and a second surge in adolescence where intravaginal torsion is common. Cases of intravaginal torsion with preserved flow and their critical sonographic findings are described in this review. Preserved flow indicates these cases did not have completely absent flow (which is typically straightforward and diagnostic for testicular torsion) on color Doppler exam. Instead, the affected testis had either decreased or symmetrical preserved flow compared to the contralateral unaffected side, sometimes even increased flow. In many of our cases, it was extremely difficult to decide whether the flow was truly symmetrical to the contralateral side or was subtly decreased. Of all the cases with preserved flow, decreased flow in the affected testis was more commonly observed than symmetrical or increased flow. The patient age in our cases ranged from 3 years to 19 years, the majority being 12 years and older. While studying some of our youngest patients (3–6 years), we noted that they all presented with abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and received the typical workup for pain including ultrasound examination to rule out appendicitis. The nonspecific symptoms resulted in a delayed diagnosis. It is important to remember that intravaginal torsion can occur even in such young patients, though less frequently compared to adolescents, and when presentation is right-sided it can mimic appendicitis. A clinical examination of the scrotum is recommended in all boys with right lower quadrant pain and a low threshold for a scrotal ultrasonography.

### Testicular tumours in children: an approach to diagnosis and management with pathologic correlation [^113x9v4Y]. Insights Into Imaging (2020). Medium credibility.

Clinical presentations

TTs usually manifest as painless testicular mass (82–90%) and less than 10% as painful mass secondary to haemorrhage or necrosis. Physical exploration and other clinical data (fever, acute pain, vomiting) can help to differentiate an intratesticular lesion from hydrocele, inguinal hernia, testicular torsion or inflammatory scrotum.

TTs can be detected on a prenatal US; the most frequent congenital TT is juvenile granulosa cell tumour, the left testis is the most affected and up to 20% have ambiguous external genitalia.

Some histologic types can show more specific clinical presentations: Leydig tumour has a peak incidence between 5 and 10 years and the dysregulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis may lead to hormonal stimulation because of the androgen and oestrogen secretion by the tumour, and near 30% of cases present signs of feminizing or virilizing syndrome (pubertal precocious, gynecomastia). Testosterone high levels are present. Bilateral testicular Leydig cell tumours are rare (3%) and require exclusion of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. Sertoli tumour in children can produce gynecomastia typically. The subtype large-cell calcifying Sertoli tumour is seen in prepuberal boys associated with syndrome Peutz-Jeghers and Carney complex being then frequently multifocal and bilateral.

Incidental TT smaller than 2 cm occurs in about 13% of children and goes up to 30% when children are between 5 and 12 years old.

The most common secondary tumour is the leukemic infiltration. The typical clinical presentation is as unilateral or bilateral painless testicular mass. The scrotum size is larger than in any other primary TT.

### Menotropins (menopur) [^114vqMFA]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

What are possible side effects of MENOPUR?

MENOPUR may cause serious side effects, including:

ovaries that are too large. MENOPUR may cause your ovaries to be abnormally large. Symptoms of large ovaries include bloating or pain in your lower stomach (pelvic) area. If your ovaries become too large your healthcare provider may tell you that you should not have intercourse (sex) so you do not rupture an ovarian cyst.
ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Using MENOPUR may cause OHSS. OHSS is a serious medical condition that can happen when your ovaries produce too many eggs (overstimulated). OHSS can cause fluid to suddenly build up in the area of your stomach, chest, heart, and cause blood clots to form. OHSS may also happen after you stop using MENOPUR. Stop using MENOPUR and call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away if you have any of the following symptoms of OHSS:
severe pelvic or stomach pain
nausea
vomiting
sudden weight gain
swollen stomach
diarrhea
trouble breathing
decreased or no urine
lung problems. MENOPUR may cause serious lung problems that can sometimes lead to death including fluid in the lungs, trouble breathing, and worsening of asthma.
blood clots. MENOPUR may increase your chance of having blood clots in your blood vessels. Blood clots can cause:
blood vessel problems (thrombophlebitis)
stroke
loss of your arm or leg
blood clot in your lung (pulmonary embolus)
twisting (torsion) of your ovary. MENOPUR may increase the chance of your ovary twisting, if you already have certain conditions such as OHSS, pregnancy, and previous abdominal surgery. Twisting of your ovary may lead to blood flow being cut off to your ovary.
pregnancy with and birth of multiple babies. MENOPUR may increase your chance of having a pregnancy with more than 1 baby. Having a pregnancy and giving birth to more than 1 baby at a time increases the health risk for you and your babies. Your healthcare provider should talk to you about your chances of multiple births before you start using MENOPUR.
birth defects. Babies born after ART may have an increased chance of birth defects. Your age, certain sperm problems, your genetic background, and that of your partner, and a pregnancy with more than 1 baby at a time may increase the chance that your baby may have birth defects.
ectopic pregnancy (pregnancy outside your womb). MENOPUR may increase your chance of having a pregnancy that is abnormally outside of your womb. Your chance of having a pregnancy outside of your womb is increased if you also have fallopian tube problems.
miscarriage. Your chance of loss of an early pregnancy may be increased if you had difficulty becoming pregnant.
tumors of the ovary. If you have used medicines like MENOPUR more than 1 time to get pregnant, you may have an increased chance of having tumors in your ovaries, including cancer.

We present a case of a middle childhood boy who presented to our paediatric emergency department with severe right upper thigh pain, radiating to inguinal/hip area. The pain was sharp in nature, described like a severe cramp which started 10 hours prior to presentation, progressively increasing over time. He denied any recent trauma or infective symptoms, and there were no other associated complaints. On physical examination, he was in tears due to excruciating pain which he could not locate precisely, had tense muscles at the right posterior upper thigh and lower gluteal area and had limping. Also, he had mild right testicular tenderness on examination which he did not complain of before, no skin changes or swelling with normal cremasteric reflex. His investigations were significant for asymmetric ischiopubic synchondrosis on pelvic X-ray. Scrotal ultrasound showed no evidence of testicular torsion. Pelvic MRI showed features consistent with the right ischiopubic synchondrosis osteomyelitis. He spiked a high-grade fever of 40°C within 24 hours of presentation. His blood culture grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus On admission, he was managed initially with ceftriaxone, vancomycin and clindamycin. After the blood culture result, he received ceftriaxone for 2weeks, followed by oral cefuroxime for another 2weeks. Pain controlled with ketorolac and paracetamol. Our patient was diagnosed and started on antibiotics within 24 hours from presentation.

### A comparison of clinical outcomes of acute testicular torsion between prepubertal and postpubertal males [^116NGyfv]. Journal of Pediatric Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Short Introduction/Background

Surgical intervention for acute testicular torsion can require either orchiopexy or orchiectomy. The decision of which surgery to perform is dependant on the amount of time that the testicle experienced ischemia and the viability of the testicle after reperfusion.

Objective

It is hypothesized that (1) there is a difference in orchiectomy and orchiopexy rates between prepubertal and postpubertal males with acute testicular torsion and (2) presenting symptoms may vary between the two age groups as prepubertal males may present with atypical symptoms, which could result in delayed presentation and diagnosis.

Study Design

A retrospective chart review was conducted on pediatric patients who were diagnosed with acute testicular torsion between June 2010 and August 2017. Demographic and clinical characteristics were extracted: age, ethnicity, referral pattern, primary insurance status, symptoms at presentation, prior history of ipsilateral testicular pain or intermittent torsion, recent trauma to genitalia, duration of symptoms (hours), gradual vs. acute onset of symptoms, time/weekday/season at presentation, and time interval from arrival at the study institution to surgical intervention (minutes). Patients were categorized into two groups: prepubertal group (age 1–12 years) and postpubertal group (age 13–18 years). Statistical analyses were performed using R, version 3.3.1.

Results

Ninety-one patients were included in the study. The overall orchiectomy rate was 30.8%. More prepubertal males underwent orchiectomy than postpubertal males (42.4% vs. 24.1%, respectively). Prepubertal males were more likely to present with abdominal pain than postpubertal males (27.3% vs. 10.3%, respectively). Those who underwent orchiectomy were more likely to present with longer duration of symptoms, testicular swelling, and abdominal pain than those who underwent orchiopexy. The risk of orchiectomy decreased by 14% per 1-year increase in age (odds ratio [OR]: 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.94–1.00, p = .009). A steady decline in the proportion of patients undergoing orchiectomy was seen from 1 to 12 years of age.

Discussion

This study found that prepubertal males are at higher risk for orchiectomy than postpubertal males. The risk of orchiectomy decreases by 14–16% per 1-year increase in age. Prepubertal males are more likely to present with atypical symptoms and delayed presentation and diagnosis, leading to delayed surgical intervention. It is important for providers to perform a genital examination in prepubertal males who present with abdominal pain to rule out acute testicular torsion. Patients presenting with longer duration of symptoms, testicular swelling, and abdominal pain are at higher risk for orchiectomy. No correlation was found between orchiectomy rate and ethnicity, referral status, primary insurance status, and time/weekday/season at presentation.

Conclusion

Among patients presenting to a tertiary pediatric hospital with acute testicular torsion, prepubertal males (younger than 12 years) are at higher risk for orchiectomy than postpubertal males. Prepubertal males are more likely to present with atypical symptoms which results in delayed presentation and diagnosis, leading to delayed in surgical intervention.

### Testicular pain-not always what it seems: a cross-sectional assessment of patients presenting for chronic scrotal content pain at a tertiary care center [^112v28nz]. Urology (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

To review historical and examination findings in patients presenting to a tertiary care center for evaluation of Chronic Scrotal Content Pain (CSCP) defined by persistent/bothersome pain present for > 3-months.

Methods

We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients presenting to our medical center for evaluation of CSCP. Pertinent information collected included historical data, physical examination findings, laboratory and imaging results, and treatments recommended by the assessing physician. The data was summarized to present a cross-sectional representation of patients presenting for CSCP.

Results

110 patients were identified. 80 patients (73%) had seen at least one prior urologist. 26 patients (24%) had undergone a prior unsuccessful surgical intervention for CSCP. Reproducible tenderness was present in 67% of patients including testicular tenderness in 50 (45%), epididymal tenderness in 60 (55%), and spermatic cord tenderness in 31 patients (28%). 33% of patients did not have any reproductible scrotal content tenderness on physical examination. Surgery was recommended in 57/110 patients (52%), including microdenervation in 22%. Musculoskeletal etiologies were suspected based on specific aspects of the history and physical examination in 43 patients (39%), prompting additional evaluation and/or referrals.

Conclusion

CSCP presents with a wide array of symptoms and many patients do not have reproducible findings on examination, suggesting alternative sources of pain such as referred pain from musculoskeletal causes. The history and physical examination should include assessments for concurrent abdominal, back, hip, and other genital/pelvic pain that may suggest alternative diagnoses and referrals for appropriate treatment.

### Abdominal pain in teenagers: beware of testicular torsion [^114d667P]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Background/Purpose

Testicular torsion (TT) remains an important cause of testicular loss. Subtle presentations, such as abdominal pain, may be responsible for late diagnosis and increased testicular loss. This study assesses the influence of pain onset location over testicular outcome.

Methods

Data of children 17 years and younger submitted to surgical treatment for TT by our department from January 2017 to December 2018 were collected. Demographics, clinical presentation and outcome were reviewed.

Results

73 patients (median age of 15.3 years old) were included in the study. 22% (16/73) patients presented with abdominal pain. When compared to patients with initial testicular pain, patients with abdominal pain showed a significant delay in TT diagnosis/treatment (median pain duration of 36 h vs 5 h) and a significantly higher rate of testicular loss [81% (13/16) vs 4% (2/57), p < 0.001]. The majority of testicular losses (68%, 13/19) occurred in patients with abdominal pain. In patients with abdominal pain, TT was initially overlooked in 69% (11/16) of cases, resulting in 81% (9/11) gonadal loss; none of these 11 patients were initially evaluated by a surgeon. All patients with testicular pain were evaluated in order to exclude TT.

Conclusions

Abdominal pain is a frequent presentation of TT, being an important cause of delayed diagnosis/treatment and associated higher testicular loss rate.

### Evaluation of scrotal masses [^114b3aAa]. American Family Physician (2014). Low credibility.

Scrotal masses are caused by a variety of disorders, ranging from benign conditions to those requiring emergent surgical intervention. Painful scrotal masses require urgent evaluation. Characteristics that suggest testicular torsion include rapid symptom onset, nausea and vomiting, high position of the testicle, and abnormal cremasteric reflex. Doppler ultrasonography or surgical exploration is required to confirm the diagnosis. Surgical repair must occur within six hours of symptom onset to reliably salvage the testicle. Epididymitis/orchitis have a slower onset and are associated with a C-reactive protein level greater than 24 mg per L (228.6 nmol per L) and increased blood flow on ultrasonography. Acute onset of pain with near normal physical examination and ultrasound findings is consistent with torsion of the testicular appendage. Testicular malignancies cause pain in 15% of cases. If ultrasonography shows an intratesticular mass, timely urology referral is indicated. Inguinal hernias are palpated separate to the testicle and can cause pain. Emergent surgery is indicated for a strangulated hernia. Hydrocele, varicocele, and scrotal skin lesions may be managed in nonurgent settings. A biopsy should be performed to rule out cancer in patients with scrotal skin lesions that are erosive, vascular, hyperkeratotic, or nonhealing, or that change color or have irregular borders.

### ACR appropriateness criteriaAcute onset of Scrotal pain-without trauma, without antecedent mass [^117L1kG2]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2019). Medium credibility.

An acute scrotum is defined as testicular swelling with acute pain and can reflect multiple etiologies including epididymitis or epididymo-orchitis, torsion of the spermatic cord, or torsion of the testicular appendages. Quick and accurate diagnosis of acute scrotum and its etiology with imaging is necessary because a delayed diagnosis of torsion for as little as 6 hours can cause irreparable testicular damage. Ultrasound duplex Doppler of the scrotum is usually appropriate as the initial imaging for the acute onset of scrotal pain without trauma or antecedent mass in an adult or child. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of current medical literature from peer reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

### Demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic factors associated with delayed diagnosis and management of pediatric testicular torsion in west China: a retrospective study of 301 cases in a single tertiary children's hospital [^112wv5Pn]. BMC Pediatrics (2021). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patients demographics, factors, and definitions

A retrospective review of the medical records on TT at the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from November 2004 to December 2020 was conducted. Only surgically confirmed TTs and boys age more than six months were consecutively included in this study, these patients refused to surgery or surgically found not to be TT were not included.

According to European Association of Urology guidelines on pediatric urology 2020 (available at), surgical detorsion of TT not exceed 12 h was found to avoid infertility, and all TT cases should undergo urgent surgical exploration within 24 h from symptoms onset to diagnosis. We defined delayed management of TT as duration more than 12 h from symptoms onset to surgery, in the meanwhile, we also identified 24 h as an important duration interval.

Demographic data included data of birth, data of symptoms onset, and data of surgery. Age at symptoms onset, and duration of symptoms onset to surgery were calculated by the data of birth, and the time of symptoms onset and surgery. Moreover, age category was further divided into three groups: pre-school (0–5 years), school-age (6–12 years), and puberty (13–18 years).

The extracted clinical data included the following: laterality, other diagnoses, whether having concomitant extra-scrotal symptoms, whether having symptoms progress, history of former treatment, and class of first-consultant medical establishment and diagnosis. Other concomitant diagnoses included hydrocele, cryptorchidism, inguinal hernia, and testicular microlithiasis. Concomitant extra-scrotal symptoms included abdominal pain, nausea, vomit, inguinal pain or masses, and fever. A history of former treatment defined as these patients had a first visit to a primary health care unit or their local hospital before transferring to our hospital. All clinical data were extracted or transferred from reliable medical records.

### Factors associated with delayed presentation and misdiagnosis of testicular torsion: a case-control study [^113tR5Kk]. The Journal of Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

We identified factors associated with delay in presentation and misdiagnosis of testicular torsion. Compared with acute cases, delayed presentations were more likely to report isolated abdominal pain, developmental disorders, and history of recent genital trauma. Failure to perform a genitourinary examination or scrotal imaging was associated with misdiagnosis.

### Atypical presentation delays treatment of pediatric testicular torsion [^113mMoaE]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study is to identify patient- and care-related factors associated with time to treatment for acute testicular torsion and the likelihood of testicular loss.

Methods

Data were retrospectively collected for patients 18 years and younger who had surgery for acute testicular torsion between April 1, 2005, and September 1, 2021. Atypical symptoms and history were defined as having abdominal, leg, or flank pain, dysuria, urinary frequency, local trauma, or not having testicular pain. The primary outcome was testicular loss. The primary process measure was time from emergency department (ED) triage to surgery.

Results

One hundred eleven patients were included in descriptive analysis. The rate of testicular loss was 35%. Forty-one percent of all patients reported atypical symptoms or history. Eighty-four patients had adequate data to calculate time from symptom onset to surgery and time from triage to surgery and were included in analyses of factors affecting risk of testicular loss. Sixty-eight patients had adequate data to evaluate all care-related time points and were included in analyses to determine factors affecting time from ED triage to surgery. On multivariable regression analyses, increased risk of testicular loss was associated with younger age and longer time from symptom onset to ED triage, while longer time from triage to surgery was associated with reporting atypical symptoms or history. The most frequently reported atypical symptom was abdominal pain, in 26% of patients. These patients were more likely to have nausea and/or vomiting and abdominal tenderness but equally likely to report testicular pain and swelling and have testicular findings on examination.

Conclusions

Patients presenting to the ED with acute testicular torsion reporting atypical symptoms or history experience slower transit from arrival in the ED to operative management and may be at greater risk of testicular loss. Increased awareness of atypical presentations of pediatric acute testicular torsion may improve time to treatment.

### Why adolescents delay with presentation to hospital with acute testicular pain: a qualitative study [^117G3mxw]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background/Purpose

Adolescents have poor outcomes following testicular torsion directly attributable to delay from onset of symptoms to presentation to hospital. The aim of this study was to investigate the barriers to urgent presentation in young men.

Methods

Semistructured interviews were undertaken with young men (11–19 years), using a topic guide exploring issues surrounding testicular pain and health. Thematic analysis was undertaken using a framework approach.

Results

Twenty-seven adolescents were recruited, data saturation was reached at sixteen participants, and median age was 13.5 years (range 11–18). The process by which an adolescent gets to hospital with testicular pain is slow. They must recognize the problem and alert their parents, who then use a 'watch and wait' policy to assess need for medical review, often leaving it 'a day' or overnight. Adolescent males do not engage with healthcare services independently of their parents. Additional factors preventing early presentation include: absence of knowledge about testicular pathology from adolescents and their parents; concern from the young people about raising a false alarm and family concerns about burdening healthcare services.

Conclusions

Recommendations include designing a testicular health education campaign for young men and educating parents regarding the medical conditions where a 'watch and wait' policy may be harmful to their child.

### Testicular torsion after laparoscopic appendectomy: salvage by spermatic cord heparin flush and testicular decompression-a case report and literature review [^111MfkcX]. BMC Pediatrics (2025). Medium credibility.

Testicular torsion is characterized by a sudden onset of scrotal pain, often occurring during sleep or after strenuous exercise. The pain manifests initially as a vague sensation and subsequently transitions into a severe, persistent or intermittent pain. Some patients may also experience concomitant pain in the lower abdomen or groin area, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, or fever. Patients may also present with non-specific symptoms such as fever or lower urinary tract symptoms. It is noteworthy that cryptorchid torsion is a distinct type of testicular torsion, with a prevalence ranging from 21 to 53 times higher in children with cryptorchid testes. Its clinical manifestations include scrotal emptiness, atypical abdominal pain, and a palpable mass in the inguinal region, often accompanied by fever, nausea, vomiting, and other symptoms. A differential diagnosis is often necessary to rule out other potential pathologies, including inguinal incarcerated hernia, acute inguinal lymphadenitis, intestinal obstruction, and appendicitis, among others. Testicular torsion is also occasionally observed in conjunction with positive inguinal palpation, elevated, transverse, or oblique testicular position, thickening of the spermatic cord, and tenderness.

The diagnosis of testicular torsion is primarily determined by a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's symptoms, a physical examination, blood tests, and ultrasonography. Medical professionals meticulously examine the position, morphology, and tenderness of the testis through palpation and other investigative procedures. Ultrasound imaging plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis of testicular torsion, as it can reveal abnormalities such as testicular enlargement and reduced or absent blood flow signals. The utilization of ultrasound Doppler examination has the potential to diminish the necessity for patients experiencing acute scrotal discomfort to undergo scrotal exploration procedures. Nevertheless, the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound Doppler examination for testicular torsion is contingent on the expertise of the operator and can be more challenging to interpret in prepubertal patients. In the early stages of testicular torsion and in patients with incomplete or intermittent testicular torsion, ultrasound Doppler examination can also show arterial blood flow and misdirect the diagnosis. The point is that the detection of persistent arterial flow does not completely exclude the possibility of testicular torsion either. In instances where there is a discrepancy in the intensity of arterial flow between the two testes, a meticulous differential diagnosis is imperative. TWIST holds considerable clinical value in the diagnosis of testicular torsion, with the potential to expedite the diagnostic process. Its utilization in conjunction with ultrasonography in medical institutions equipped with the necessary resources is recommended (Table 1).

### Cross-sectional imaging of complicated urinary infections affecting the lower tract and male genital organs [^1157GpzH]. Insights Into Imaging (2016). Low credibility.

Clinical overview of urinary tract infections

The commonest conditions predisposing patients to either acquiring infection or experiencing a more severe outcome are listed in Table 1, categorised with the mnemonic RENUC.

Table 1
Risk factors for acquiring urinary tract infection, developing complications, and/or failing treatment (mnemonic RENUC) [Adapted from Ref.]

C-UTIs may or may not cause symptoms. Manifestations of active infection often overlap with pre-existing chronic complaints secondary to the underlying lower urinary tract dysfunction. The severity of UTI is graded clinically as follows: a) asymptomatic; b) causing local symptoms such as dysuria, urinary frequency, urgency, supra- or retropubic pain or bladder tenderness; c) causing general symptoms including fever, flank pain, nausea and vomiting; d) systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS); and e) circulatory and organ failure. The SIRS includes fever or hypothermia, leukocytosis or leukopenia, tachycardia and tachypnoea, and represents the first step to multi-organ failure. Urosepsis is defined by the presence of UTI plus SIRS, and warrants immediate bacteriological and imaging investigation to allow for timely treatment. Although associated with a better prognosis than other forms of sepsis, urosepsis remains a critical situation, with a 20–40% fatality rate, particularly in the elderly and immunocompromised. Mortality is considerably increased in severe sepsis (with symptoms of organ dysfunction) and septic shock (with persistent hypotension).

### Male chronic pelvic pain: AUA guideline: part I evaluation and management approach [^112hQ1U4]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

Chronic scrotal content pain (CSCP) — definition, burden, presentation, and evaluation are described as follows: "CSCP or chronic testicular pain or chronic orchialgia is defined as unilateral scrotal pain interfering with activities of daily living that has persisted for greater than three months of time", and it "is usually diagnosed after excluding other potential causes (e.g., testicular torsion, epididymitis, orchitis, abscess, testicular mass, varicocele)". The condition's impact is noted as "CSCP constitutes approximately 2.5% to 4.8% of all urology visits and is believed to affect over 100,000 men annually". Patients often have tenderness and neuropathic features: "The pain is commonly described in the testes with tenderness in the epididymis and/or spermatic cord appreciated on physical examination", and "Neuropathic changes such as hypersensitivity or hyperalgesia in the region of the groin may accompany these findings", with a fluctuating course — "The pain typically waxes and wanes". Care "requires a multi-disciplinary approach to management", and "Managing patient expectations through supportive counseling during this path is important to overall success". For workup, "potential underlying causes should be ruled out with a thorough physical exam and detailed history", and examples include "post-vasectomy pain syndrome (PVPS), post-inguinal hernia repair, pain caused by trauma, after abdominal surgery, radiation, and radicular pain from spinal or sacral issues".

Regarding screening and diagnosis for acute epididymitis, more specifically with respect to clinical presentation, CDC 2021 guidelines recommend to recognize that:

- acute epididymitis is characterized by pain, swelling, and inflammation of the epididymis lasting < 6 weeks

- sometimes a testicle is also involved, a condition referred to as epididymo-orchitis

- acute epididymitis can be caused by STIs (such as C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, or Mycoplasma genitalium) or enteric organisms (such as E. coli)

- acute epididymitis caused by STIs is usually accompanied by urethritis, which is frequently asymptomatic

- acute epididymitis caused by sexually transmitted enteric organisms might also occur in males who are the insertive partner during anal sex

- nonsexually transmitted acute epididymitis caused by genitourinary pathogens typically occurs with bacteriuria secondary to bladder outlet obstruction (such as BPH)

- nonsexually transmitted acute epididymitis in older males is also associated with prostate biopsy, urinary tract instrumentation or surgery, systemic disease, or immunosuppression.

### Evaluation of nausea and vomiting [^111GcL98]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

A comprehensive history and physical examination can often reveal the cause of nausea and vomiting, making further evaluation unnecessary. Acute symptoms generally are the result of infectious, inflammatory, or iatrogenic causes. Most infections are self-limiting and require minimal intervention; iatrogenic causes can be resolved by removing the offending agent. Chronic symptoms are usually a pathologic response to any of a variety of conditions. Gastrointestinal etiologies include obstruction, functional disorders, and organic diseases. Central nervous system etiologies are primarily related to conditions that increase intracranial pressure, and typically cause other neurologic signs. Pregnancy is the most common endocrinologic cause of nausea and must be considered in any woman of childbearing age. Numerous metabolic abnormalities and psychiatric diagnoses also may cause nausea and vomiting. Evaluation should first focus on detecting any emergencies or complications that require hospitalization. Attention should then turn to identifying the underlying cause and providing specific therapies. When the cause cannot be determined, empiric therapy with an antiemetic is appropriate. Initial diagnostic testing should generally be limited to basic laboratory tests and plain radiography. Further testing, such as upper endoscopy or computed tomography of the abdomen, should be determined by clinical suspicion based on a complete history and physical examination.

### A 43-year-old woman with abdominal pain and fever [^116qjTKf]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2010). Low credibility.

Diagnostic Reasoning

The problem representation is an abstract one-sentence summary that elaborates the key features of the case. It triggers plausible diagnostic hypotheses and directs exploration of further historical elements, physical examination features and diagnostic testing. In complex cases it is often necessary to consider more than one problem representation. Here the competing versions might be: (1) a 43-year-old woman of reproductive age with a subacute febrile illness and headaches associated with LUQ abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting; or (2) a 43-year-old woman of reproductive age with acute onset of sharp, unremitting LUQ pain, nausea and vomiting. Using the first problem representation, the clinician would likely consider serious intracranial infections and mass lesions. In the second problem representation, the LUQ pain is the focal point that directs further data gathering. It is often useful to explore competing problem representations to avoid "premature closure". Premature closure is the failure to consider other plausible diagnoses after an initial working diagnosis is reached. It is one of the most common clinical reasoning errors made by clinicians.

She had no significant past medical history. Her only medication was acetaminophen. Her family history was unremarkable. She was unemployed and denied current or prior alcohol, tobacco or drug use. She was born in Mexico and immigrated to the United States at age 23. She travels to Mexico regularly and had returned 3 weeks ago after a 2-month visit. Review of systems was notable for night sweats and a 20-pound intentional weight loss over the past several months.

Although the 20-pound weight loss is described as being intentional, the rarity of that achievement and associated night sweats suggest a systemic illness such as infection, autoimmune disease or malignancy. Her travel to Mexico places her at risk for tuberculosis (gastrointestinal and CNS manifestations) and amebiasis (colitis or liver abscess). Autoimmune syndromes with gastrointestinal manifestations include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), polyarteritis nodosa and inflammatory bowel disease. Lymphoma would be the most likely malignancy given her age and constitutional symptoms.

### Factors determining testicular torsion and consequent orchiectomy in pediatric patients presenting with scrotal pain [^115hzAng]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Medium credibility.

METHODS

Participants and Study Design

This retrospective observational study was conducted in PEDs at Chang Gung Medical Hospital (CGMH) in Northern Taiwan from January 1, 2011 to August 31, 2021. Patients presenting with SP with or without nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain, with testicular tenderness and swelling, an absent cremasteric reflex, and high-riding testicle were considered to have SP,– whereas patients with traumatic SP and incomplete records were excluded. This study was approved by the CGMH Institutional Review Board (no. 202200006B0). All methods followed approved guidelines and regulations for medical research.

The patients with SP in our study were divided into group A (aged < 10 years) and group B (aged 10–18 years). The demographic information obtained included age, time of SP occurrence, the involved testicle, and season of the SP event. The numbers of patients with TT-associated symptoms and referred from other hospitals, interval between SP onset and PED arrival, testicular ultrasonic blood flow (TUBF), intervals between triage and surgery and between SP onset and surgery, side of TT, and degree of TT were recorded. The numbers of patients needing surgery, surgically confirmed TT, orchiopexy, orchiectomy, hospital admission, and hospital length of stay (LOS) were also evaluated. Testicular torsion-associated symptoms were defined as inguinal swelling and pain, scrotal skin erythema or dark color, scrotal swelling, scrotal tenderness, a hard testis on palpitation, abdominal pain, and nausea or vomiting.

Doppler ultrasound (DUS) was performed by senior urology residents or a pediatrician. If the TUBF on the affected side was reduced or absent compared with the opposite side, or a clinical diagnosis of TT was strongly suspected, surgical exploration was recommended to the patients and their families, and the operation was performed after obtaining informed consent.

Testicular torsion was confirmed at surgery and surgical detorsion of the TT was performed; the affected testis was then bathed in warm water for 20 to 30 minutes. If the testis recovered and became pink on reperfusion or fresh bleeding was seen on the cut surface, it was attached to the scrotum and orchiopexy was done. Orchiectomy was performed if the testis failed to reperfuse after detorsion, then orchiopexy was performed on the contralateral testis to prevent TT. The diagnosis of TT was confirmed surgically and the degree of TT was reviewed.

### Atypical testicular pain [^115mcT5R]. BMJ Case Reports (2019). High credibility.

Testicular tuberculosis (TB) is rare, and, because of this, the lack of pathognomonic clinical features and its tendency to mimic other commoner conditions, the diagnosis is frequently delayed or may be missed. In this case, the initial clinical presentation was typical for bacterial epididymo-orchitis in a 38-year-old man. When the patient failed to improve with standard treatment including broadening of antibiotics, the diagnosis was re-considered because some unusual signs suggested testicular malignancy or lymphoma. Further, history-taking and subsequent cross-sectional imaging with CT/MRI identified co-existent pulmonary nodularity, thoracic and abdominal lymphadenopathy and bony changes that, together, raised the suspicion of TB. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was confirmed on DNA-based testing of the hydrocele fluid, although standard acid-fast bacilli culture was negative. This case prompted a review of the literature to explore the optimal steps in the investigation and diagnosis of this rare disease.

### High platelet distribution width can independently predict testicular survival in testicular torsion among patients with steady-state sickle cell anemia [^112K3kGU]. World Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Methods

Patients

One hundred and fifteen patients with steady-state SCA were referred to the emergency department with acute scrotal pain. From this group, only 48 patients diagnosed with testicular torsion were enrolled in the study and underwent surgical exploration.

Forty-six patients with clinically diagnosed healthy testicular torsion were also included as control subjects from patients admitted to the emergency department for testicular exploration, with a similar age between the two groups. The control subjects had no epididymo-orchitis, testicular tumor, history of scrotal trauma and surgery, or hematological diseases. All participants provided written informed consent before enrollment in the study.

Selection criteria

Inclusion criteria

Patients with a complaint of acute scrotal pain were initially included. Testicular torsion was diagnosed by scrotal color Doppler ultrasonography (CDUS) and was conﬁrmed by surgical exploration. The included participants with SCA were confirmed by qualitative and/or quantitative hemoglobin electrophoresis.

Exclusion criteria

Patients with SCA were included after excluding perinatal testicular torsion, other known testicular pathology (cryptorchidism, testicular tumor, and epididymo-orchitis), or cases associated with compromised vascular testicles. Excluded patients were also those with chronic hepatic, renal, or hematological (eg, myeloproliferative disorders and leukemia) diseases. Patients with previous overt stroke and acute pain crisis hospitalization within 1 year were also excluded. Any patient who underwent manual detorsion followed by elective testicular fixation at a later date was also excluded.

Clinical examination

All subjects underwent physical examination after their medical histories were taken. Clinical findings included scrotal characteristics (tenderness, erythema, and swelling), the affected side, high-riding testis, lower abdominal pain, fever (> 38.5°C), nausea/vomiting, and pyuria. Symptom duration was defined as the time between onset of acute symptoms and detorsion.

CDUS was performed in all patients at the time of admission as the mainstay for evaluation of acute scrotal pain. Measurements obtained on CDUS included testicular volume of the normal and torsed testicles and the presence or absence of testicular blood ﬂow.

All patients with presumed torsion underwent scrotal exploration. During exploration, decisions regarding orchiectomy or orchiopexy were made by the surgeon. All explored patients were managed by detorsion of the torsed testicle with bilateral orchiopexy or orchiectomy.
