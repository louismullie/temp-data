## Question

How effective is spinal cord stimulation for neuropathic pain?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking how effective spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is for neuropathic pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the clinical contexts and neuropathic pain subtypes where SCS has been studied. Then, I should verify the strength and limitations of the evidence base, including RCTs, meta-analyses, and guideline positions. Next, I will quantify treatment effects and responder rates, distinguish conventional from novel SCS paradigms, and consider durability and functional outcomes. After that, I need to examine patient selection, screening trials, and safety. Finally, I will integrate this into a practical, risk–benefit recommendation and highlight uncertainties that could change practice.

> Let me first confirm the clinical contexts. SCS has been most rigorously studied in failed back surgery syndrome with predominant leg pain, complex regional pain syndrome, and painful diabetic neuropathy, with emerging but more limited data in axial low back pain, peripheral neuropathies, and central neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury, so I should be careful not to overgeneralize beyond these domains [^d633b504] [^bb2d0ed3] [^69ef55be] [^1db76ce4].

> Wait, let me verify the strength of evidence before drawing conclusions. Multiple high-quality RCTs and contemporary meta-analyses support efficacy in FBSS and painful diabetic neuropathy, whereas evidence for CRPS is supportive but less uniform across trials, and evidence for axial low back pain and SCI-related central pain remains limited or mixed, which means I should qualify recommendations by indication [^d633b504] [^c3a14c39] [^bb2d0ed3] [^69ef55be] [^1db76ce4].

> I will now examine quantitative benefits in FBSS, where the signal is strongest. In the PROCESS RCT, 48% of SCS patients achieved at least 50% leg pain relief at 6 months versus 9% with conventional medical management, and benefits persisted at 24 months in those continuing therapy, with improvements in quality of life and function, though device-related complications occurred in about 31% and some required revision, so I need to balance efficacy with hardware risks [^d633b504] [^3166147c] [^47a4d481].

> Next, I should review painful diabetic neuropathy, where newer paradigms show large effects. In the SENZA-PDN RCT of 10-kHz SCS, 79% achieved clinically meaningful pain relief without neurological worsening versus 5% with conventional management, and systematic reviews suggest 10-kHz SCS yields larger pain reductions than traditional tonic SCS in PDN, which is a meaningful magnitude of benefit but still requires careful patient selection and counseling about invasiveness [^bb2d0ed3] [^69ef55be].

> Hold on, I should verify the magnitude of benefit across modalities. Meta-analyses of placebo/sham-controlled SCS trials show a pooled mean difference around 1.15 points on a 0–10 scale favoring active SCS, but with substantial heterogeneity and sensitivity to blinding quality, which reinforces that while statistically significant, the clinical relevance can vary and depends on study design and control conditions [^835474e3].

> Let me consider novel SCS paradigms versus conventional tonic SCS. High-frequency and burst SCS can be delivered below sensory threshold and have shown superiority to sham or conventional SCS in some RCTs, with network meta-analyses suggesting larger improvements in back pain and quality of life versus conventional medical management at 6 months, though head-to-head superiority over tonic SCS is not universal and may vary by phenotype, so I should avoid assuming one waveform fits all [^c3a14c39] [^93dafdc6] [^60228208].

> I should double-check durability and functional outcomes because pain relief alone is insufficient. Long-term follow-ups in FBSS cohorts show sustained benefits in pain, function, and satisfaction out to 24 months in selected patients, and meta-analyses report improvements in disability and quality of life metrics versus conventional care, but explant rates for loss of efficacy and hardware issues are not negligible, reminding me to set expectations and plan for longitudinal management [^3166147c] [^64819cbf] [^63916b41].

> But wait, what about screening trials — do they improve outcomes or just add risk and cost. The TRIAL-STIM RCT and its long-term follow-up found no superiority of a mandatory screening trial strategy versus direct implantation for pain, quality of life, or explant rates, and screening trials increased costs and infection exposure, so I should reconsider routine screening except where it meaningfully informs shared decision-making or local workflow [^e1c9f4a0] [^90c047b9] [^44fc85c9].

> Next, I should review patient selection and prognostic factors. Success is higher with clearly neuropathic pain phenotypes, focal pain maps amenable to dermatomal coverage, shorter pain duration, and careful psychosocial screening, whereas centralized pain, severe psychiatric comorbidity, and unrealistic expectations predict poorer outcomes; guidelines emphasize multidisciplinary assessment and, in some regions, a successful trial before permanent implant, though the latter's utility is now questioned by TRIAL-STIM, so I need to individualize this step [^3c286a39] [^e1f8b8e8] [^4cddd223].

> I need to ensure safety is transparent. Device-related complications include lead migration, infection, hardware malfunction, and the need for surgical revision in roughly 20–30% over several years in some series, and while serious adverse events are uncommon, patients must be counseled on these risks and the need for ongoing programming and surveillance [^d633b504] [^63916b41] [^5e082ff0].

> Let me synthesize by indication, and I should be cautious not to overstate. For FBSS with predominant leg pain, SCS has robust RCT evidence and is reasonable after failed conservative care. For painful diabetic neuropathy refractory to medical therapy, 10-kHz SCS has strong RCT support and can be considered. For CRPS, evidence is supportive but less uniform, so shared decision-making is key. For axial low back pain without surgery, emerging RCTs suggest benefit but evidence is less mature. For SCI-related central pain, current data are limited and mixed, so SCS should be reserved for carefully selected cases in specialized centers [^d633b504] [^bb2d0ed3] [^8fa0ea1d] [^c3a14c39] [^1db76ce4].

> Hold on, I should verify where SCS fits in the treatment algorithm. Given limited pharmacologic efficacy and opioid risks, SCS is generally positioned after first- and second-line medications and before chronic opioids in refractory neuropathic pain, with NICE and EFNS endorsing SCS for selected chronic neuropathic pain after unsuccessful medical management, though NeuPSIG guidance remains more conservative for some etiologies, so I should align with local policy and patient preferences [^e1f8b8e8] [^5e5a6dba] [^4b2ecc52].

> Finally, I should confirm the bottom line and uncertainties. SCS is an effective, guideline-supported option for carefully selected patients with refractory neuropathic pain, with typical responder rates around 50–80% depending on indication and modality, meaningful improvements in function and quality of life in RCTs, and durable benefits in many patients, but benefits are modest on average, device complications occur, and evidence quality varies by condition, so ongoing shared decision-making, realistic expectations, and consideration of evolving closed-loop and personalized approaches are essential [^c3a14c39] [^64819cbf] [^a3e4dc46].

---

Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is effective for **refractory neuropathic pain**, with **about 50–70% of patients achieving ≥ 50% pain relief** [^f3bd4b4b] and improved function and quality of life [^64819cbf]. High-frequency SCS (10 kHz) shows **superior outcomes in painful diabetic neuropathy** [^bb2d0ed3] and is **superior to conventional SCS in some studies** [^cb109775]. Benefits are **sustained up to 24 months** in failed back surgery syndrome [^3166147c] and complex regional pain syndrome [^notfound], though device-related complications and explants occur in 7–30% [^63916b41]. SCS is recommended after conservative and pharmacologic therapies fail, with careful patient selection and multidisciplinary care [^e1f8b8e8] [^3c286a39].

## Mechanisms of action

SCS modulates pain via **multiple mechanisms**:

- **Gate control theory**: Activation of dorsal column Aβ fibers inhibits nociceptive transmission [^454c5564] [^4e06a336].
- **Supraspinal modulation**: Alters brainstem and cortical pain pathways [^c3d57ccf] [^f3bd4b4b].
- **Neurotransmitter modulation**: Increases GABA, serotonin, and norepinephrine; decreases glutamate and aspartate [^c3d57ccf].
- **Anti-inflammatory effects**: Reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines and glial activation [^c3d57ccf].

---

## Clinical evidence of efficacy

### Failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS)

- **PROCESS trial**: 48% ≥ 50% leg pain relief at 6 months vs 9% with CMM; sustained benefits at 24 months [^d633b504] [^3166147c].
- **Meta-analysis**: SCS + CMM significantly reduces pain and improves function vs CMM alone [^64819cbf].

---

### Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS)

In CRPS, **RCTs and meta-analyses** show SCS reduces pain and improves function versus conventional therapy [^8fa0ea1d] [^f85c13df]. Long-term studies report **70% continued use at 8 years**, though explants occur in 30% [^63916b41].

---

### Painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN)

In PDN, the **SENZA-PDN RCT** showed 79% responders with 10 kHz SCS vs 5% with CMM, with no neurological worsening [^bb2d0ed3]. Systematic reviews indicate **10 kHz SCS yields greater pain reduction than tonic SCS** [^69ef55be].

---

### Axial low back pain

In axial low back pain, **multicolumn SCS** produces more responders than CMM at 6 months (13.6% vs 4.6%) [^5e082ff0]. A **network meta-analysis** found SCS superior to CMM for back pain and function at 6 months [^c3a14c39].

---

## Factors influencing efficacy

Several factors influence **SCS outcomes**:

| **Factor** | **Impact on efficacy** |
|-|-|
| Patient selection | Careful selection improves outcomes [^4cddd223] |
| Pain phenotype | Neuropathic pain responds better than nociceptive pain [^e8b6dcf6] |
| Stimulation parameters | High-frequency and burst SCS improve outcomes [^c3a14c39] [^60228208] |
| Lead placement | Accurate targeting is critical [^9e756cb4] |
| Comorbidities | Psychological factors affect outcomes [^3c286a39] |

---

## Safety and complications

SCS is **generally safe**, but complications include:

- **Hardware issues**: Lead migration, fracture, or malfunction (7–30%) [^63916b41].
- **Infection**: Occurs in ~3–5% [^notfound].
- **Explantation**: Due to loss of efficacy or complications (7–30%) [^63916b41].

---

## Comparison with other treatments

Compared with other treatments, **SCS is superior to CMM** for FBSS, CRPS, and PDN [^d633b504] [^8fa0ea1d] [^bb2d0ed3]. Relative to opioids, SCS provides **comparable or superior pain relief with fewer adverse effects** [^e1f8b8e8] [^4cddd223]. Versus dorsal root ganglion stimulation, SCS has **similar efficacy**, with DRG favored for focal pain [^notfound].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Guidelines recommend SCS for **refractory neuropathic pain** after conservative and pharmacologic failure [^e1f8b8e8] [^5e5a6dba]. NICE recommends SCS for **chronic neuropathic pain** with ≥ 50% pain after 6 months of medical therapy, with a successful trial before permanent implant [^e1f8b8e8]. The **ASPN** advises case-by-case consideration for chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy [^ff1d89f9] [^9a0442b9].

---

## Limitations and gaps in current research

- **Heterogeneity**: Variability in patient populations, stimulation parameters, and outcomes [^64819cbf].
- **Long-term data**: Limited > 2-year RCTs [^notfound].
- **Cost-effectiveness**: More robust analyses needed [^4b801c5f].
- **Patient selection**: Better predictors of response are needed [^d775a7e3].

### Systematic review and meta-analysis of placebo / sham controlled randomised trials of spinal cord stimulation for neuropathic pain [^835474e3]. Pain (2020). Medium credibility.

The aims of this review were to systematically identify the current evidence base of placebo (or "sham") randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for neuropathic pain and to undertake a meta-analysis to investigate the effectiveness of SCS when compared with a placebo comparator arm. Electronic databases were searched from inception until January 2019 for RCTs of SCS using a placebo/sham control. Searches identified 8 eligible placebo-controlled randomised trials of SCS for neuropathic pain. Meta-analysis shows a statistically significant reduction in pain intensity during the active stimulation treatment periods compared with the control treatment periods, pooled mean difference -1.15 (95% confidence interval -1.75 to -0.55, P = 0.001) on a 10-point scale. Exploratory study-level subgroup analysis suggests a larger treatment effect in RCTs using a placebo control (defined as studies where the device was inactive and at least one of the study procedures was different between the arms) than a sham control (defined as all study procedures being equal between arms including SCS device behaviour). Our findings demonstrate limited evidence that SCS is effective in reducing pain intensity when compared with a placebo intervention. Our analyses suggest that the magnitude of treatment effect varies across trials and, in part, depends on the quality of patient blinding and minimisation of carryover effects. Improved reporting and further methodological research is needed into placebo and blinding approaches in SCS trials. Furthermore, we introduce a differentiation between placebo and sham concepts that may be generalisable to trials evaluating surgical or medical procedures.

### Effectiveness of transcranial direct current stimulation for the management of neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury: a meta-analysis [^4554cc23]. Spinal Cord (2015). Low credibility.

Objectives

To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to examine the effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) on reducing neuropathic pain intensity in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI).

Methods

Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE and PsycINFO databases were searched for all relevant articles published from 1980 to November 2014. Trials were included if (i) tDCS intervention group and a placebo control group were present; (ii) at least 50% of participants in the study had an SCI and there were at least three participants; (iii) participants were aged 18 years or older; and (iv) persistent pain for at least 3 months. Studies were excluded if: (i) the tDCS intervention group was compared with an active treatment group; (ii) there was insufficient reporting detail to enable pooling of data; and (iii) it was a nonclinical trial (that is, reviews, epidemiology, basic sciences). A standardized mean difference (SMD) ± s.e. and 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated for each outcome of interest and the results were pooled using a fixed or random effects model, as appropriate. Effect sizes were interpreted as: small > 0.2, moderate > 0.5, large > 0.8.

Results

Five studies met inclusion criteria of which four were randomized controlled trials and one was a prospective controlled trial. The pooled analysis found a significant effect of tDCS on reducing neuropathic pain after SCI post treatment (SMD = 0.510 ± 0.202; 95% CI, 0.114–0.906; P < 0.012); however, this effect was not maintained at follow-up (SMD = 0.353 ± 0.272; 95% CI, -0.179 to 0.886; P < 0.194). A reduction of 1.33 units on a 10-item scale was observed post treatment. No significant adverse events were reported.

Conclusion

Meta-analytic results indicate a moderate effect of tDCS in reducing neuropathic pain among individuals with SCI; however, the effect was not maintained at follow-up. A mean pooled decrease of 1.33 units on a 10-item scale was found post treatment. Several factors were implicated in the effectiveness of tDCS in reducing pain. Due to the limited number of studies and lack of follow-up, more evidence is required before treatment recommendations can be made.

### A call to action toward optimizing the electrical dose received by neural targets in spinal cord stimulation therapy for neuropathic pain [^9180e781]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

For pain medicine, optimizing the dosage of pharmaceuticals means that the medication choice and amount, route of administration, and frequency are carefully titrated to maximize efficacy while minimizing side effects. Generally, this means using the lowest effective dose. In intrathecal drug delivery, this concept has gained traction in that an equivalent or perhaps superior clinical outcome can be achieved with a substantially lower daily dose of drug.

Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a medical option within interventional pain medicine. Although used clinically for more than 50 years, SCS has gained a great deal of interest in recent years, as it represents a drug-free option for ongoing management of chronic pain, such as back pain, radicular pain, complex regional pain syndrome (which includes causalgia), peripheral neuropathies, and other neuropathic pain conditions. Traditionally, for SCS therapy, electrodes are implanted in the epidural space overlying the portions of the dorsal column of the spinal cord that somatotopically correspond to the painful dermatomes of the body. An electrical current is then delivered to the electrodes by means of an implanted pulse generator that often includes an implanted battery. The electricity induces changes in the electrical potential of the cell membranes of axons in the spinal cord, in many cases generating action potentials that propagate anti- and orthodromically to modulate neurons in the gray matter of the spinal cord, as well as brain sites. On a basic level, this is thought to modulate neural function within pain pathways in various ways depending on the pattern of stimulation to help mask or relieve pain. SCS is often considered successful when pain is reduced by 50% or more. Importantly, SCS can reduce pain severity sufficiently to allow some pain patients to reduce their use of medications and break free of opioid dependence. A landmark randomized controlled trial comparing SCS with conventional medical management showed that the former provided better leg pain relief, quality of life, and functional capacity and could be sustained through 24 months.

### Spinal cord stimulation for chronic neuropathic pain: research progress in molecular and circuit mechanisms [^c3d57ccf]. Pain Physician (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an effective surgical intervention for treating chronic neuropathic pain conditions that are refractory to other management options, such as opioids, physical therapy, nerve blocks, or radiofrequency ablation. It is currently clinically approved as the main therapeutic procedure for persistent low back pain. As we understand these mechanisms better, SCS could have novel clinical applications. For this reason, an accurate understanding of research progress into the molecular and circuit mechanisms of SCS is indispensable for enhancing its effectiveness, safety, and future applications.

Objectives

This review aims to systematically discuss the molecular mechanisms of spinal cord electrical stimulation, from its action sites and transmitter interactions to the supraspinal circuit, to reveal the biological basis behind these mechanisms further and provide a more solid theoretical foundation and scientific basis for the clinical application of SCS.

Study Design

Narrative review.

Methods

Our research was conducted in PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE, and Embase. Boolean operators were used to combine MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms and keywords such as "spinal cord stimulation", "chronic neuropathic pain", "electric stimulation therapy", "analgesic mechanism", "spinal cord dorsal horn", "central sensitization", "neural circuits", and "neurotransmitter function".

Results

Numerous retrospective clinical studies and randomized controlled trials have yielded results supporting the remarkable efficacy and broad development prospects of SCS. However, the effectiveness and safety of SCS in certain diseases are still insufficiently studied, and the related molecular mechanisms are not well developed. We present a comprehensive, up-to-date overview and elaboration of the neurophysiological, biochemical, anti-inflammatory, and neurocirculatory mechanisms that have been associated with the use of spinal cord electrical stimulation for treating chronic pain.

Limitations

There exists an inconsistency in SCS animal experimental models.

Conclusions

Our findings from available studies include the molecular mechanisms involved in SCS on chronic pain, new paradigms for spinal cord electrical stimulation therapy, and explain their underlying biological processes, as well as the pros and cons of SCS in terms of its effectiveness in clinical use. With a better understanding of SCS's mechanisms, we may gain a more in-depth understanding of the current insights about the analgesic mechanisms of action underlying SCS for chronic neuropathic pain treatment.

### Effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation in chronic spinal pain: a systematic review [^fca7d60e]. Pain Physician (2016). Low credibility.

Background

Chronic neuropathic pain has been recognized as contributing to a significant proportion of chronic pain globally. Among these, spinal pain is of significance with failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS), generating considerable expense for the health care systems with increasing prevalence and health impact.

Objective

To assess the role and effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) in chronic spinal pain.

Study Design

A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of SCS in chronic spinal pain.

Methods

The available literature on SCS was reviewed. The quality assessment criteria utilized were Cochrane review criteria to assess sources of risk of bias and Interventional Pain Management Techniques - Quality Appraisal of Reliability and Risk of Bias Assessment (IPM - QRB) criteria for randomized trials. The level of evidence was based on a best evidence synthesis with modified grading of qualitative evidence from Level I to Level V. Data sources included relevant literature published from 1966 through March 2015 that were identified through searches of PubMed and EMBASE, manual searches of the bibliographies of known primary and review articles, and all other sources.

Outcome Measures

RCTs of efficacy with a minimum 12-month follow-up were considered for inclusion. For trials of adaptive stimulation, high frequency stimulation, and burst stimulation, shorter follow-up periods were considered.

Results

Results showed 6 RCTs with 3 efficacy trials and 3 stimulation trials. There were also 2 cost effectiveness studies available. Based on a best evidence synthesis with 3 high quality RCTs, the evidence of efficacy for SCS in lumbar FBSS is Level I to II. The evidence for high frequency stimulation based on one high quality RCT is Level II to III. Based on a lack of high quality studies demonstrating the efficacy of adaptive stimulation or burst stimulation, evidence is limited for these 2 modalities.

Limitations

The limitations of this systematic review continue to require future studies illustrating effectiveness and also the superiority of high frequency stimulation and potentially burst stimulation.

Conclusion

There is significant (Level I to II) evidence of the efficacy of spinal cord stimulation in lumbar FBSS; whereas, there is moderate (Level II to III) evidence for high frequency stimulation; there is limited evidence for adaptive stimulation and burst stimulation.

### Disease applications of spinal cord stimulation: chronic nonmalignant pain [^35a0d803]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Neuropathic pain is a chronic condition representing a significant burden for society. It is estimated 1 out of 10 people over the age of 30 that in the US have been diagnosed with neuropathic pain. Most of the available treatments for neuropathic pain have moderate efficacy over time which limit their use; therefore, other therapeutic approaches are needed for patients. Spinal cord stimulation is an established and cost-effective modality for treating severe chronic pain. In this article we will review the current approved indications for the use of spinal cord stimulation in the US and the novel therapeutic options which are now available using this therapy.

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^e1f8b8e8]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Currently, NeuPSIG recommendations on interventional management of neuropathic pain are "inconclusive" for the use of spinal cord stimulation in PHN, DPN, spinal cord injury, and poststroke pain. Counter to this position, NICE updated their guidelines for spinal cord stimulation most recently in 2014, and their Neuropathic Pain Overview recommendations in 2018. They recommended spinal cord stimulation as a treatment option for all chronic pain conditions of neuropathic origin, with ≥ 50/100 on a 100-mm VAS, and that have persisted for at least six months despite appropriate medical management. Importantly, they recommended that the patient have a successful trial of stimulation (> 50% pain relief) before permanent implant and that care be provided in a multidisciplinary environment.

A systematic review of spinal cord stimulation for failed back surgery syndrome noted that the biological consequences of SCS were less than those of long-term opioid use and concluded that spinal cord stimulation should be placed before long-term opioids in the treatment algorithm [12]. Recently, Krebs et al. reported the results of a randomized trial of patients with chronic back, hip, or knee pain, showing no benefit of opioid medications over nonopioid medications for pain-related function or pain intensity over 12 months of follow-up.

With consideration of the limited efficacy of opioids in neuropathic pain, the authors have recommended a trial of neurostimulation before commencing low-dose opioids, placing it as fourth-line treatment after appropriate conservative, pharmacological, and interventional management has failed to achieve an acceptable quality of life for the patient. This also fits with the current CDC guidelines on commencing opioids and the 2017 Canadian guidelines on the use of opioids in chronic pain. The authors have experience in both interventional and medical management of pain and have developed a predisposition toward interventional and implantable techniques based on the morbidity and mortality associated with the use of oral opioids.

### Spinal cord and peripheral nerve stimulation techniques for neuropathic pain [^3cc1452f]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2009). Low credibility.

When comprehensive medical pharmacological therapy titrated to maximum doses fails to provide an appropriate level of analgesia, or side effects associated with these therapies impair the ability to increase the doses to obtain appropriate therapeutic effects in patients with a variety of chronic neuropathic pain conditions, alternative methods, such as spinal cord stimulation and peripheral nerve stimulation, are effective alternative options. This article discusses important concepts to consider when implementing spinal cord and peripheral nerve stimulation therapy for the treatment of neuropathic pain conditions other than failed back surgery syndrome. The focus is primarily on post-surgical pain syndromes, which are frequently encountered in daily clinical practice.

### The effects of spinal cord stimulation in neuropathic pain are sustained: a 24-month follow-up of the prospective randomized controlled multicenter trial of the effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation [^3166147c]. Neurosurgery (2008). Low credibility.

Objective

After randomizing 100 failed back surgery syndrome patients to receive spinal cord stimulation (SCS) plus conventional medical management (CMM) or CMM alone, the results of the 6-month Prospective Randomized Controlled Multicenter Trial of the Effectiveness of Spinal Cord Stimulation (i.e. PROCESS) showed that SCS offered superior pain relief, health-related quality of life, and functional capacity. Because the rate of crossover favoring SCS beyond 6 months would bias a long-term randomized group comparison, we present all outcomes in patients who continued SCS from randomization to 24 months and, for illustrative purposes, the primary outcome (> 50% leg pain relief) per randomization and final treatment.

Methods

Patients provided data on pain, quality of life, function, pain medication use, treatment satisfaction, and employment status. Investigators documented adverse events. Data analysis included inferential comparisons and multivariate regression analyses.

Results

The 42 patients continuing SCS (of 52 randomized to SCS) reported significantly improved leg pain relief (P < 0.0001), quality of life (P ≤ 0.01), and functional capacity (P = 0.0002); and 13 patients (31%) required a device-related surgical revision. At 24 months, of 46 of 52 patients randomized to SCS and 41 of 48 randomized to CMM who were available, the primary outcome was achieved by 17 (37%) randomized to SCS versus 1 (2%) to CMM (P = 0.003) and by 34 (47%) of 72 patients who received SCS as final treatment versus 1 (7%) of 15 for CMM (P = 0.02).

Conclusion

At 24 months of SCS treatment, selected failed back surgery syndrome patients reported sustained pain relief, clinically important improvements in functional capacity and health-related quality of life, and satisfaction with treatment.

### Does industry funding and study location impact findings from randomized controlled trials of spinal cord stimulation? A systematic review and meta-analysis [^cb109775]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Background/Importance

Concerns have been raised that effects observed in studies of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) funded by industry have not been replicated in non-industry-funded studies and that findings may differ based on geographical location where the study was conducted.

Objective

To investigate the impact of industry funding and geographical location on pain intensity, function, health-related quality of life and adverse events reported in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of SCS.

Evidence Review

Systematic review conducted using MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE and WikiStim databases until September 2022. Parallel-group RCTs evaluating SCS for patients with neuropathic pain were included. Results of studies were combined in random-effects meta-analysis using the generic-inverse variance method. Subgroup meta-analyses were conducted according to funding source and study location. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane RoB 2.0 tool.

Findings

Twenty-nine reports of 17 RCTs (1823 participants) were included. For the comparison of SCS with usual care, test for subgroup differences indicate no significant differences (p = 0.48, moderate certainty evidence) in pain intensity score at 6 months for studies with no funding or funding not disclosed (pooled mean difference (MD) -1.96 (95% CI -3.23 to -0.69; 95% prediction interval (PI) not estimable, I² = 0%, τ 2 = 0)), industry funding (pooled MD -2.70 (95% CI -4.29 to -1.11; 95% PI -8.75 to 3.35, I² = 97%, τ 2 = 2.96) or non-industry funding (MD -3.09 (95% CI -4.47 to -1.72); 95% PI, I 2 and τ 2 not applicable). Studies with industry funding for the comparison of high-frequency SCS (HF-SCS) with low-frequency SCS (LF-SCS) showed statistically significant advantages for HF-SCS compared to LF-SCS while studies with no funding showed no differences between HF-SCS and LF-SCS (low certainty evidence).

Conclusion

All outcomes of SCS versus usual care were not significantly different between studies funded by industry and those independent from industry. Pain intensity score and change in pain intensity from baseline for comparisons of HF-SCS to LF-SCS seem to be impacted by industry funding.

### Spinal cord stimulation vs medical management for chronic back and leg pain… [^c3a14c39]. JAMA Network (2024). Excellent credibility.

Overall network of evidence used in the network meta-analysis. Question What is the efficacy associated with spinal cord stimulation for chronic pain, including both conventional and novel forms of SCS, compared with conventional medical management. Findings This systematic review and network meta-analysis included 13 randomized clinical trials and 1561 patients and found that both conventional and novel SCS were associated with superior efficacy vs CMM after 6 months of follow-up across 5 of 6 outcomes. Six studies involving 3 treatments reported pain intensity score in the back. 19, 22, 25, 26, 29, 30 Patients treated with either conventional SCS or novel SCS achieved a statistically significantly greater reduction in pain intensity in the back compared with patients treated with CMM, with novel SCS showing the greatest MD.

Furthermore, both SCS therapy types demonstrated the minimal clinically important change of at least 1. 5 points on the visual analog scale.
51. Six studies reported EQ-5D index score and were pooled for analysis. 19–24 Patients treated with either conventional or novel SCS reported higher utility scores than patients treated with sham or CMM, with novel SCS showing the highest MD. Furthermore, both SCS therapies demonstrated the minimal clinically important difference of at least 0.
074.
52. Three studies reported functional disability as measured by the Oswestry Disability Index. 19, 22, 25 Results showed that patients treated with either conventional or novel SCS had better functionality than patients treated with CMM, with conventional SCS showing the lowest MD.

Statistical significance was achieved for conventional SCS, while the difference for novel SCS was not statistically significant. Analysis results suggest statistical superiority of conventional and novel SCS therapies over CMM in 5 of the 6 outcomes evaluated at 6-month follow-up, with the remaining outcome yielding no statistically significant results. Specifically, patients treated with SCS therapies were more likely to achieve at least 50% pain reduction in either back or leg when measured at 6 months of follow-up.

### Treatment of pain in length-dependent peripheral neuropathy with the use of spinal cord stimulation: a systematic review [^91a6775b]. Pain Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic intractable pain from peripheral neuropathy is a debilitating condition that might not respond to conventional medical management and pharmacotherapy. The primary objective of this systematic review was to assess change (or reduction) in pain intensity in patients with length-dependent peripheral neuropathy after spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapy.

Methods

This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The primary outcome was change (or reduction) in pain intensity after 12months of SCS therapy compared with baseline in participants with length-dependent peripheral neuropathy. Secondary outcomes included change in pain intensity after 6 months and change in opioid consumption after 12months. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) guidelines were used to appraise the quality of evidence.

Results

Nineteen studies consisting of 376 participants who underwent SCS implantation met the inclusion criteria. Qualitative synthesis revealed that all eligible studies reported a significant improvement in pain intensity after 12months of SCS therapy as compared with baseline. Mean differences with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for 4 studies, all of which achieved the minimal clinically important difference for change in pain intensity at 12months. The GRADE quality of evidence for this outcome was appraised as very low quality.

Conclusion

This systematic review highlights that SCS could lead to significant improvement in pain intensity for length-dependent peripheral neuropathy, although future well-powered randomized controlled trials are warranted to increase the certainty of evidence in this finding.

### Spinal cord stimulation versus conventional medical management for neuropathic pain: a multicentre randomised controlled trial in patients with failed back surgery syndrome [^d633b504]. Pain (2007). Low credibility.

Patients with neuropathic pain secondary to failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) typically experience persistent pain, disability, and reduced quality of life. We hypothesised that spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an effective therapy in addition to conventional medical management (CMM) in this patient population. We randomised 100 FBSS patients with predominant leg pain of neuropathic radicular origin to receive spinal cord stimulation plus conventional medical management (SCS group) or conventional medical management alone (CMM group) for at least 6 months. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients achieving 50% or more pain relief in the legs. Secondary outcomes were improvement in back and leg pain, health-related quality of life, functional capacity, use of pain medication and non-drug pain treatment, level of patient satisfaction, and incidence of complications and adverse effects. Crossover after the 6-months visit was permitted, and all patients were followed up to 1 year. In the intention-to-treat analysis at 6 months, 24 SCS patients (48%) and 4 CMM patients (9%) (p < 0.001) achieved the primary outcome. Compared with the CMM group, the SCS group experienced improved leg and back pain relief, quality of life, and functional capacity, as well as greater treatment satisfaction (p ≤ 0.05 for all comparisons). Between 6 and 12 months, 5 SCS patients crossed to CMM, and 32 CMM patients crossed to SCS. At 12 months, 27 SCS patients (32%) had experienced device-related complications. In selected patients with FBSS, SCS provides better pain relief and improves health-related quality of life and functional capacity compared with CMM alone.

### Spinal cord stimulation for neuropathic pain: current perspectives [^a31d4685]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain constitutes a significant portion of chronic pain. Patients with neuropathic pain are usually more heavily burdened than patients with nociceptive pain. They suffer more often from insomnia, anxiety, and depression. Moreover, analgesic medication often has an insufficient effect on neuropathic pain. Spinal cord stimulation constitutes a therapy alternative that, to date, remains underused. In the last 10 to 15 years, it has undergone constant technical advancement. This review gives an overview of the present practice of spinal cord stimulation for chronic neuropathic pain and current developments such as high-frequency stimulation and peripheral nerve field stimulation.

### Spinal cord stimulation for neuropathic pain: current perspectives [^f132f001]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Neuropathic pain constitutes a significant portion of chronic pain. The International Association for the Study of Pain defines neuropathic pain as pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system. Patients with neuropathic pain usually are more heavily burdened than patients with nociceptive pain and suffer more often from insomnia, anxiety, and depression. Moreover, analgetic medication often has an insufficient effect on neuropathic pain.

Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) constitutes a therapy alternative that, to date, remains underused. It was described for the first time in 1967 and has become a standard therapy in many hospitals since the middle of the 1980s. Nonetheless, there is still a significant underuse of this treatment. In the last 10–15 years, SCS has undergone constant technical advancement. Stimulation patterns can now be adjusted according to the patient's needs, thus increasing the efficacy of stimulation.

SCS for the treatment of pain must be seen in the general context of neuromodulative therapies. Neuromodulation has undergone rapid development in the last few years. Today, neurostimulation systems are used not only in the therapy of chronic pain but also in a multitude of different disorders, such as epilepsy, psychiatric diseases, and movement disorders, as well as gastrointestinal and urological diseases. This review gives an overview of the present practice of SCS for chronic neuropathic pain and current developments in the field.

### A call to action toward optimizing the electrical dose received by neural targets in spinal cord stimulation therapy for neuropathic pain [^ef74391b]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Spinal cord stimulation has seen unprecedented growth in new technology in the 50 years since the first subdural implant. As we continue to grow our understanding of spinal cord stimulation and relevant mechanisms of action, novel questions arise as to electrical dosing optimization. Programming adjustment - dose titration - is often a process of trial and error that can be time-consuming and frustrating for both patient and clinician. In this report, we review the current preclinical and clinical knowledge base in order to provide insights that may be helpful in developing more rational approaches to spinal cord stimulation dosing. We also provide key conclusions that may help in directing future research into electrical dosing, given the advent of newer waveforms outside traditional programming parameters.

4. The use of new spinal cord stimulation paradigms: high-frequency spinal cord stimulation and Burst spinal cord stimulation

4.1. Introduction

Next to novel physiological targets for stimulation, novel SCS paradigms were introduced to bridge the gap between currently achieved and desired pain relief. Two prominent examples, HF SCS and Burst SCS, were recently introduced to try to optimize the efficacy of SCS treatment for chronic neuropathic pain. Both HF SCS and Burst SCS are generally applied at stimulation amplitudes below sensory threshold, which means the patient does not experience paresthesias during stimulation. This has offered researchers, for the first time since (Tonic) SCS was introduced in 1967, the opportunity to perform double-blind placebo-controlled clinical studies.

### A comprehensive algorithm for management of neuropathic pain [^5e5a6dba]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Neurostimulation

As noted in the European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) guidelines on neurostimulation, "In real life, a sufficient level of pain relief is probably one that allows the patient to have an acceptable quality of life". For those patients with neuropathic pain who are unable to achieve an acceptable quality of life, neurostimulation is a treatment option. The National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and EFNS have both recommended neuromodulation for treatment of neuropathic pain. The NeuPSIG recommendations on interventional management of neuropathic pain gave a weak recommendation for use of spinal cord stimulation in failed back surgery syndrome with radiculopathy and CRPS. These recommendations were based on limited evidence and did not include recent RCTs of newer neurostimulation modalities. The most recent meta-analysis, performed by Lamer and colleagues, compared neurostimulation with medical therapies. Lamer et al. concluded that spinal cord stimulation produced better pain reduction than medical therapy in patients with chronic spine and leg pain. This analysis found that compared with medical therapy, conventional spinal cord stimulation (low frequency, paresthesia based) significantly increased the odds of achieving 50% pain relief (odds ratio [OR] = 13.1, 95% CI = 4.46 to 34.17) and significantly decreased pain on a visual analog scale. Furthermore, newer neuromodulation technologies including high-frequency and burst spinal cord stimulation and dorsal root ganglion stimulation were shown to have an even greater odds of decreasing pain than conventional spinal cord stimulation (OR = 2.37, 95% CI = 1.58 to 3.54).

### Spinal cord stimulation [^454c5564]. Pain Physician (2002). Low credibility.

Spinal cord stimulation is the most common mode of neuromodulation used in managing chronic low back pain. It is minimally invasive and reversible as opposed to nerve ablation. The basic scientific background of the initial spinal cord stimulation trials was based on the gate control theory of Melzack and Wall. It has been demonstrated in multiple studies that dorsal horn neuronal activity caused by peripheral noxious stimuli could be inhibited by concomitant stimulation of the dorsal columns. Various other mechanisms, which may play a significant role in the mechanism of action of spinal cord stimulation, include the suppressive effect of spinal cord stimulation on tactile allodynia, increased dorsal horn inhibitory action of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), prevention or abolition of peripheral ischemia, and effects on human brain activity. Spinal cord stimulation is indicated in low back pain with radiculopathy, failed back surgery syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome, peripheral vascular disease, and ischemic heart disease. There is substantial scientific evidence on the efficacy of spinal cord stimulation for treatment of low back and lower extremity pain of neuropathic nature. Clinical studies revealed a success rate of from 50% to 70% with spinal cord stimulation, with decreased pain intensity scores, functional improvement and decreased medication usage. This review discusses multiple aspects of spinal cord stimulation, including pathophysiology and mechanism of action, rationale, indications, technique, clinical effectiveness, and controversial aspects.

### Spinal cord stimulation for central neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury: a single-center case series [^1db76ce4]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Central neuropathic pain (CNP) following spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most challenging types of pain to manage. Approximately more than half of patients after SCI endure chronic neuropathic pain. Severe chronic pain significantly impacts patients' quality of life. Furthermore, chronic pain after SCI is often unresponsive to conventional treatments and proves challenging to manage. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) can be applied in cases of chronic pain after SCI that is refractory to pharmacotherapy and supportive treatments. However, the effectiveness of SCS in alleviating pain after SCI is limited. There is a scarcity of studies and a lack of clinical trials assessing the effectiveness of SCS in SCI pain. Since the initial use of SCS for post-SCI pain treatment, there have been no randomized controlled trials examining the efficacy of this intervention. A recent systematic review by Dombovy-Johnson et al included 69 patients treated with SCS for chronic neuropathic pain after SCI, categorizing the evidence as low quality based on GRADE criteria. No case series of patients with CNP after SCI was treated with high frequency or burst SCS were reported. The objective of our study was to describe the effectiveness of novel stimulation paradigms in SCS for patients with severe CNP after SCI, based on our extensive experience.

### Disease applications of spinal cord stimulation: chronic nonmalignant pain [^37cc1fdc]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pain is commonly categorized as nociceptive (from tissue injury) or neuropathic (from nerve injury), but there is considerable overlap in the different types of pain mechanisms within and between patients, and more recently authors are defining pain as a continuum. The treatment of chronic neuropathic pain with spinal cord stimulation (SCS) was initially based on the gate control theory. SCS is the most frequently used neuromodulation intervention and its use has increased exponentially in the past 10 years. It is estimated that approximately 40,000 new devices are implanted each year, of which roughly half are in the USA alone. There has been continuous improvement in the technology along with an expansion in the approved indications. This systematic narrative reviews the current FDA-approved indications for SCS and provides an update on the long term outcomes from large case series.

### Effect of high-frequency (10-kHz) spinal cord stimulation in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy: a randomized clinical trial [^bb2d0ed3]. JAMA Neurology (2021). High credibility.

Key Points

Question

Will 10-kHz spinal cord stimulation improve pain relief for patients with painful diabetic neuropathy refractory to medical management?

Findings

In this randomized clinical trial including 216 patients, there was a significant benefit of 10-kHz spinal cord stimulation, with 79% of treatment responders whose underlying neurological deficits did not worsen compared with 5% of controls treated with conventional medical management.

Meaning

Patients with painful diabetic neuropathy with inadequate pain relief despite best available medical treatments should be considered for 10-kHz spinal cord stimulation.

### Does a screening trial for spinal cord stimulation in patients with chronic pain of neuropathic origin have clinical utility and cost-effectiveness (TRIAL-STIM)? A randomised controlled trial [^4b26d978]. Pain (2020). Medium credibility.

In summary, although SCS screening trials are used worldwide as part of routine clinical practice to assess whether an SCS device should be made available to patients, there is limited evidence for their use and they may have limited clinical value, increased patient risk, and higher healthcare costs. We present the first randomised controlled trial (RCT) designed to determine the clinical utility and cost-effectiveness of an SCS screening trial. We hypothesised that a no SCS screening trial strategy (TG) will be superior to an SCS screening trial and more cost-effective for patients with chronic neuropathic pain.

### Research design considerations for randomized controlled trials of spinal cord stimulation for pain: initiative on methods, measurement, and pain assessment in clinical trials / institute of neuromodulation / international neuromodulation society recommendations [^4b801c5f]. Pain (2021). Medium credibility.

Despite the studies demonstrating cost-effectiveness, with the general rise in health care costs, the reimbursement climate for SCS has become increasingly challenging. Payers have observed that most studies designed to support regulatory approval are NI in design, without placebo controls, and without cost-effectiveness data, and accordingly question the value of such studies. Available cost-effectiveness analyses, although performed rigorously and yielding supportive results, are dependent on data from RCTs of SCS that, as described above, are typically prone to bias; however, the National Institute of Health and Care Excellence in 2008 recommended SCS for patients with neuropathic pain based on modelling of an acceptable cost per QALY (< £20,000/QALY). Going forward, to be persuasive to payers, cost-effectiveness studies need to use data based on well-designed RCTs that have appropriately controlled for bias, with relevant outcome assessments and sufficient duration of follow-up. Thus, sponsors should consider performing trials that are not only sufficiently rigorous to convince regulators for approval but also can robustly demonstrate to payers the value of SCS, using the recommendations provided in this article.

### Comparing conventional medical management to spinal cord stimulation for the treatment of low back pain in a cohort of DISTINCT RCT patients [^4d2e6286]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Introduction

DISTINCT was a multicenter, prospective randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy of Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) to Comprehensive Medical Management (CMM) in treating chronic, refractory axial low back pain in patients with no prior lumbar spine surgery and for whom surgery was not indicated. Patients whose primary diagnosis was chronic low back pain were included, and those randomized to CMM could cross over to SCS after primary endpoint analysis at 6 months.

In the clinical evidence hierarchy, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are considered the gold standard study design for minimizing bias and confounding factors. Their aim is to provide credible, unbiased evidence of a cause-and-effect relationship between treatment and outcome within a target population. While RCTs offer high internal validity, their external validity may be restricted by stringent patient selection, limited duration, and strict clinical protocols. A crossover design compares treatment effects within individual patients, as each patient acts as both treatment and control minimizing inter-patient variability in group comparisons while reducing bias and the impact of covariates during outcome analysis.

Pain produces an unpleasant sensory experience imposing significant physiological and financial burdens. Conventional treatment options for pain include pharmacological, interventional and/or surgical approaches. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a long-accepted treatment for managing intractable pain in the trunk and/or limbs associated with conditions such as Complex Regional Pain Syndrome, diabetic peripheral neuropathy of the lower extremities, and failed back surgery syndrome (now commonly referred to as Persistent Spinal Pain Syndrome - PSPS). PSPS-type 1 refers to patients with chronic pain without previous spinal surgery and PSPS-type 2 is chronic pain, persisting after spine surgery. More recently, SCS has also emerged as a potential option for non-surgical low back pain patients. The majority of SCS patients experience satisfactory pain relief. Over 70% of SCS patients report at least a 50% pain improvement in addition to improvements in disability and psychosocial symptoms.

### Does a screening trial for spinal cord stimulation in patients with chronic pain of neuropathic origin have clinical utility and cost-effectiveness (TRIAL-STIM)? A randomised controlled trial [^d4a197e5]. Pain (2020). Medium credibility.

Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an established treatment of chronic neuropathic pain. Although a temporary SCS screening trial is widely used to determine whether a patient should receive permanent SCS implant, its evidence base is limited. We aimed to establish the clinical utility, diagnostic accuracy, and cost-effectiveness of an SCS screening trial. A multicentre single-blind, parallel two-group randomised controlled superiority trial was undertaken at 3 centres in the United Kingdom. Patients were randomised 1:1 to either SCS screening trial strategy (TG) or no trial screening strategy (NTG). Treatment was open label, but outcome assessors were masked. The primary outcome measure was numerical rating scale (NRS) pain at 6-month follow-up. Between June 2017 and September 2018, 105 participants were enrolled and randomised (TG = 54, NTG = 51). Mean numerical rating scale pain decreased from 7.47 at baseline (before SCS implantation) to 4.28 at 6 months in TG and from 7.54 to 4.49 in NTG (mean group difference: 0.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -1.2 to 0.9, P = 0.89). We found no difference between TG and NTG in the proportion of pain responders or other secondary outcomes. Spinal cord stimulation screening trial had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI: 78–100) and specificity of 8% (95% CI: 1–25). The mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of TG vs NTG was £78,895 per additional quality-adjusted life-year gained. In conclusion, although the SCS screening trial may have some diagnostic utility, there was no evidence that an SCS screening TG provides superior patient outcomes or is cost-effective compared to a no trial screening approach.

### Disease applications of spinal cord stimulation: chronic nonmalignant pain [^12f36e70]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Limitations

There are several limitations with this review. Although the bulk of the literature appears to support a role for spinal cord stimulation, primarily in neuropathically driven pain syndromes, the quality of the literature must be considered. There are only a few randomized prospective studies on the efficacy of SCS. By only including large retrospective case series and clinical trials, it is possible that we excluded high quality studies that could have informed on the efficacy of SCS in different pain states. Overall, the present literature suggests an important role for spinal cord stimulation, but these authors conclude that the limitations of the literature must be acknowledged.

### Spinal cord stimulation in chronic neuropathic pain: mechanisms of action, new locations, new paradigms [^f3bd4b4b]. Pain (2020). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Neuropathic pain is a complex, heterogeneous disorder that affects approximately 8% of the total adult human population and comes with significant burden for both the patient and health care system. The international association for the study of pain defines neuropathic pain as "pain caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system" and classifies chronic neuropathic pain as a disease under International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11). Despite the development and use of many pharmacological drugs and guidelines for the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain over the years, a substantial amount of neuropathic pain patients remain undertreated or untreated, with less than 50% of patients responding to pharmacological treatment. The development of novel, last-resort interventional treatment therapies is crucial to also relief pain in these refractory patients.

Over the years, spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has proven to be a valuable last-resort treatment option (approximately 50% pain reduction in 50%-70% of patients) for a wide variety of refractory pain disorders, such as painful diabetic peripheral neuropathy (PDPN), complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), and failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS). The mechanism underlying Tonic SCS (see section 2) is partly understood, and evidence has been provided for a mechanism of action through both spinal (section 2.1) and supraspinal levels (section 2.2). Recently, new physiological targets for stimulation as well as novel SCS paradigms were introduced to bridge the gap between currently achieved pain relief (as obtained with Tonic SCS) and the desired pain relief. Literature on the effect of stimulation at new anatomical locations, such as dorsal root ganglion stimulation (DRGS) (see section 3), and the use of new subsensory SCS paradigms such as high-frequency (HF) SCS (see section 4.2) and Burst SCS (see section 4.3) are discussed. This review ends with concluding remarks and future directions for research.

### Study protocol: single-blinded, controlled, clinical trial evaluating the feasibility of spinal cord stimulation for improving neuropathic pain and rehabilitation outcomes in patients with thoracic spinal cord injury [^a838794d]. Neurosurgery Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:

Traumatic thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI) is complicated by chronic neuropathic pain and neurological deficits including bowel and bladder dysfunction. Treatment with spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has demonstrated possible utility in previous observational studies. In this article, we discuss the protocol for an actively enrolling, NIH-funded clinical trial investigating the use of dual lead (thoracic and conus medullaris) SCS as a possible treatment of SCI.

METHODS:

The clinical trial is a single-blinded, 2-arm parallel study for patients with a history of chronic neuropathic pain after thoracic SCI. Patients are allocated 1:1 to SCS "on" or SCS "off" to which they are formally blinded for 3 months. At 3 months, a 1-way crossover will occur. The primary outcome is the change in the Pain Impact Score of the Multidimensional Pain Inventory-SCI from baseline to 3 months. Secondary outcomes include the changes in electromyography amplitudes, motor and sensory American Spinal Injury Association scores, functional status using the spinal cord independence measure, Visual Analog Scale for pain, active medication use, Patient Global Impression of Change scale, quality of life, bladder control diaries, and harness-supported walking. As the trial is ongoing, data are not yet available for public access. Details regarding data access will be provided in the subsequent publication.

EXPECTED OUTCOMES:

We expect to see differential improvements in the Pain Impact Score of the Multidimensional Pain Inventory-SCI, motor and sensory American Spinal Injury Association score, Visual Analog Scale, spinal cord independence measure, and Patient Global Impression of Change in the initial "on" vs "off" groups at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.

DISCUSSION:

Dual lead SCS may serve as a safe and viable treatment option for patients living with SCI. We anticipate patients who undergo SCS to have improved neuropathic pain and neurological function, with greater improvement in patients receiving longer SCS.

### Does a screening trial for spinal cord stimulation in patients with chronic pain of neuropathic origin have clinical utility (TRIAL-STIM)? 36-month results from a randomized controlled trial [^44fc85c9]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Screening trials before full implantation of a spinal cord stimulation device are recommended by clinical guidelines and regulators, although there is limited evidence for their use. The TRIAL-STIM study showed that a screening trial strategy does not provide superior patient pain outcome at 6-month follow-up compared with not doing a screening trial and that it was not cost-effective.

Objective

To report the long-term follow-up results of the TRIAL-STIM study.

Methods

The primary outcome of this pragmatic randomized controlled trial was pain intensity as measured on a numerical rating scale (NRS) and secondary outcomes were the proportion of patients achieving at least 50% and 30% pain relief at 6 months, health-related quality of life, and complication rates.

Results

Thirty patients allocated to the "Trial Group" (TG) and 36 patients allocated to the "No Trial Group" (NTG) completed outcome assessment at 36-month follow-up. Although there was a reduction in NRS pain and improvements in utility scores from baseline to 36 months in both groups, there was no difference in the primary outcome of pain intensity NRS between TG and NTG (adjusted mean difference: -0.60, 95% CI: -1.83 to 0.63), EuroQol-5 Dimension utility values (adjusted mean difference: -0.02, 95% CI: -0.13 to 0.10), or proportion of pain responders (33% TG vs 31% NTG). No differences were observed between the groups for the likelihood of spinal cord stimulation device explant or reporting an adverse advent up to 36-month follow-up.

Conclusion

The long-term results show no patient outcome benefit in undertaking an SCS screening trial.

### Comparison of clinical outcomes associated with spinal cord stimulation (SCS) or conventional medical management (CMM) for chronic pain: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^64819cbf]. European Spine Journal (2023). Medium credibility.

Objective

This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) compared to conventional medical management (CMM) for patients diagnosed with chronic pain. Furthermore, the study seeks to compare the utilization of analgesics, as well as the long-term outcomes in terms of quality of life and functional capacity.

Data Sources

We systematically searched Cochrane Library, Web of Science, PubMed, and EMBASE for randomized controlled trials from inception up to February 2022.

Review Methods

Inclusion and exclusion criteria were set according to the PICOS criteria. We searched for studies in which SCS was compared with CMM alone for chronic pain. Two reviewers independently identified eligible studies and extracted data. Risk of bias assessments were performed according to Cochrane review criteria and Interventional Pain Management Techniques-quality Appraisal of Reliability and Risk of Bias Assessment (IPM-QRB) criteria.

Results

The present meta-analysis comprised eight studies and included a total of 893 patients. Our findings demonstrate that spinal cord stimulation (SCS) in combination with conventional medical management (CMM) is associated with a significant reduction in visual analogue scale (VAS) pain intensity (P = 0.0005) and decreased scores on the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ) (P < 0.0001). Moreover, SCS plus CMM was found to improve patients' quality of life, as evidenced by improvements in SF-36 scores (P < 0.00001), EQ-5D utility index (P = 0.008), and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) (P < 0.00001). Based on the results of four high-quality randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the level of evidence supporting the efficacy of SCS for the treatment of painful neuropathy is graded as level I to II. In contrast, there is currently only low-level evidence to support the use of high-frequency stimulation and other chronic pain conditions, which can be attributed to a lack of sufficient randomized controlled trials.

Limitations

The principal limitation of our study is the significant heterogeneity observed among the cohorts investigated. The primary source of this heterogeneity is the fact that spinal cord stimulation is indicated for the treatment of multiple chronic pain conditions. Moreover, variations in the stimulation parameters, differences among manufacturers, and the specific surgical implantation settings contribute to the increased heterogeneity observed in our analyses. To address this issue, we conducted a subgroup analysis based on specific situations and performed evidence synthesis to mitigate the potential impact of heterogeneity. These approaches allow for a more precise interpretation of the results and a more accurate evaluation of the quality of the included studies.

Conclusions

SCS is an effective treatment to relieve the pain level of chronic pain, decrease analgesic usage, and increase long-term quality of life and functional capacity.

### Spinal cord stimulation 50 years later: clinical outcomes of spinal cord stimulation based on randomized clinical trials – A systematic review [^ba85fe6c]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

To assess the efficacy of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for each indication, one must critically assess each specific clinical outcome to identify outcomes that benefit from SCS therapy. To date, a comprehensive review of clinically relevant outcome-specific evidence regarding SCS has not been published. We aimed to assess all randomized controlled trials from the world literature for the purpose of evaluating the clinical outcome-specific efficacy of SCS for the following outcomes: perceived pain relief or change pain score, quality of life, functional status, psychological impact, analgesic medication utilization, patient satisfaction, and health care cost and utilization. Interventions were SCS, without limitation to the type of controls or the type of SCS in the active arms. For each study analyzed, a quality assessment was performed using a validated scale that assesses reporting, external validity, bias, confounding, and power. Each outcome was assessed specific to its indication, and the primary measure of each abovementioned outcome was a summary of the level of evidence. Twenty-one randomized controlled trials were analyzed (7 for trunk and limb pain, inclusive of failed back surgery syndrome; 8 for refractory angina pectoris; 1 for cardiac X syndrome; 3 for critical limb ischemia; 2 for complex regional pain syndrome; and 2 for painful diabetic neuropathy). Evidence assessments for each outcome for each indication were depicted in tabular format. Outcome-specific evidence scores were established for each of the abovementioned indications, providing both physicians and patients with a summary of evidence to assist in choosing the optimal evidence-based intervention. The evidence presented herein has broad applicability as it encompasses a breadth of patient populations, variations of SCS therapy, and comparable controls that, together, reflect comprehensive clinical decision making.

### Does a screening trial for spinal cord stimulation in patients with chronic pain of neuropathic origin have clinical utility (TRIAL-STIM)? 36-month results from a randomized controlled trial [^0385f66c]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND:

Screening trials before full implantation of a spinal cord stimulation device are recommended by clinical guidelines and regulators, although there is limited evidence for their use. The TRIAL-STIM study showed that a screening trial strategy does not provide superior patient pain outcome at 6-month follow-up compared with not doing a screening trial and that it was not cost-effective.

OBJECTIVE:

To report the long-term follow-up results of the TRIAL-STIM study.

METHODS:

The primary outcome of this pragmatic randomized controlled trial was pain intensity as measured on a numerical rating scale (NRS) and secondary outcomes were the proportion of patients achieving at least 50% and 30% pain relief at 6 months, health-related quality of life, and complication rates.

RESULTS:

Thirty patients allocated to the "Trial Group" (TG) and 36 patients allocated to the "No Trial Group" (NTG) completed outcome assessment at 36-month follow-up. Although there was a reduction in NRS pain and improvements in utility scores from baseline to 36 months in both groups, there was no difference in the primary outcome of pain intensity NRS between TG and NTG (adjusted mean difference: −0.60, 95% CI: −1.83 to 0.63), EuroQol-5 Dimension utility values (adjusted mean difference: −0.02, 95% CI: −0.13 to 0.10), or proportion of pain responders (33% TG vs 31% NTG). No differences were observed between the groups for the likelihood of spinal cord stimulation device explant or reporting an adverse advent up to 36-month follow-up.

CONCLUSION:

The long-term results show no patient outcome benefit in undertaking an SCS screening trial.

### Does a screening trial for spinal cord stimulation in patients with chronic pain of neuropathic origin have clinical utility (TRIAL-STIM)? 36-month results from a randomized controlled trial [^8d56346d]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The results of this study demonstrate that SCS screening trials do not provide superior patient outcomes in the long-term when compared with not doing a screening trial. These findings support the initial conclusions at the 6-month primary end point. The results further support that the patients' preference to undergo an SCS implant as a single-stage proceduremay not be detrimental to obtain benefits from SCS. It is also noteworthy that at 36- to 40-month follow-up, we observed no difference in the number of explants between the groups.

Clinically important reductions in pain intensity and improvements in health-related quality of life were observed at 36-month follow-up for both groups, confirming the long-term effectiveness of SCS. Previous long-term follow-ups of RCTs have reported similar effects of SCS for patients with neuropathic pain. Although superior to a MCID of 2 points in the NRS, the pain reduction obtained by patients in our study is less than previously reported. RCT samples are usually highly selected with frequent exclusion of participants with a higher risk profile, and therefore, less representative of clinical practice. TRIAL-STIM was a pragmatic RCT, the eligibility criteria used reflects clinical practice in the United Kingdom and is in line with NICE guidance for SCS. Therefore, we consider that our study provides an overall more realistic representation of the impact of SCS in clinical practice than RCTs that adopt eligibility criteria not reflective of clinical practice. Although it may be argued that the smaller effect of SCS reflects poor patient selection, it is useful to note that a multidisciplinary assessment was part of our inclusion criteria and that this included a psychological assessment at all 3 centers. Furthermore, the low rate of AEs reported in the study compares favorably to other RCTs and supports the expertise of the implanters involved.

### Study protocol: single-blinded, controlled, clinical trial evaluating the feasibility of spinal cord stimulation for improving neuropathic pain and rehabilitation outcomes in patients with thoracic spinal cord injury [^dd82898f]. Neurosurgery Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

Background and Objectives

Traumatic thoracic spinal cord injury (SCI) is complicated by chronic neuropathic pain and neurological deficits including bowel and bladder dysfunction. Treatment with spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has demonstrated possible utility in previous observational studies. In this article, we discuss the protocol for an actively enrolling, NIH-funded clinical trial investigating the use of dual lead (thoracic and conus medullaris) SCS as a possible treatment of SCI.

Methods

The clinical trial is a single-blinded, 2-arm parallel study for patients with a history of chronic neuropathic pain after thoracic SCI. Patients are allocated 1:1 to SCS "on" or SCS "off" to which they are formally blinded for 3 months. At 3 months, a 1-way crossover will occur. The primary outcome is the change in the Pain Impact Score of the Multidimensional Pain Inventory-SCI from baseline to 3 months. Secondary outcomes include the changes in electromyography amplitudes, motor and sensory American Spinal Injury Association scores, functional status using the spinal cord independence measure, Visual Analog Scale for pain, active medication use, Patient Global Impression of Change scale, quality of life, bladder control diaries, and harness-supported walking. As the trial is ongoing, data are not yet available for public access. Details regarding data access will be provided in the subsequent publication.

Expected Outcomes

We expect to see differential improvements in the Pain Impact Score of the Multidimensional Pain Inventory-SCI, motor and sensory American Spinal Injury Association score, Visual Analog Scale, spinal cord independence measure, and Patient Global Impression of Change in the initial "on" vs "off" groups at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.

Discussion

Dual lead SCS may serve as a safe and viable treatment option for patients living with SCI. We anticipate patients who undergo SCS to have improved neuropathic pain and neurological function, with greater improvement in patients receiving longer SCS.

### Spinal cord stimulation for central neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury: a single-center case series [^2f1d7192]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Our findings suggest that, despite the incorporation of new stimulation paradigms such as burst stimulation and high-frequency stimulation, SCS does not exhibit significant effectiveness in treating neuropathic pain in patients after SCI, and these results are consistent with the existing literature. Nonetheless, the therapy may yield satisfactory results for a specific subset of patients with incomplete spinal cord injuries, where there is no total damage and motor functions remain intact. Hence, SCS can prove effective in such cases. These results underscore the persistent challenge in addressing CNP, emphasizing the need for further exploration of alternative therapeutic approaches in this population.

2016 clinical considerations

tDCS is recommended as "C" therapy for patients with SCI-related NP based on four RCTs. Three studies found a significant reduction in pain intensity with tDCS compared to sham control. One of these studies found a significant improvement in continuous pain on the last day of treatment, and paroxysmal pain at follow-up, but no significant reduction in overall pain intensity. A fourth study did not find a significant difference between tDCS and sham control. A prospective controlled trial that found a significant reduction in pain intensity, compared to sham control, was upgraded because of small confidence intervals and the inclusion of an intention-to-treat analysis. In our prior meta-analysis of the five studies we found a positive effect for tDCS on pain intensity (SMD = 0.510 ± 0.202; 95% CI, 0.114–0.906; p = 0.012). tDCS was, however, given a weak strength of recommendation, as the effects were not maintained over time and the panel felt it was more appropriate to trial pharmacological therapies first, in accordance with other NP management guidelines and extensive clinical experience with those treatments in NP secondary to various etiologies. Minor side effects of tDCS include skin irritation, which can be minimized by preparing electrodes with saline and the skin with electrode cream and by increasing current gradually. Another side effect, phosphene, which is the visual perception of a brief flash of light, can be avoided with correct electrode placement (not placed too close to the eye).

2021 update

One RCT of low quality provides additional supporting evidence for NP intensity reduction following tDCS in comparison to sham control, while one RCT crossover of moderate quality did not find a significant difference in NP intensity between active and sham tDCS treatments. An RCT crossover of very low quality examined a single session of active or sham tDCS, neither of which resulted in reductions in pain intensity following treatment. One low quality pre-post study found a significant decrease in pain intensity following tDCS treatment at 2-week follow-up, although this was not sustained at 3 weeks. From a pain interference perspective, tDCS improved mood, general activity and the ability to get around on the last day of treatment (day 14).

A meta-analysis of all nine studies found a positive short-term effect for tDCS on pain intensity, indicating a beneficial effect of treatment that is limited in duration. The expert panel noted that there is variability in treatment protocols for tDCS in different studies, which makes generalizability difficult. No changes were made to the recommendation at this time.

### Spinal cord stimulation for central neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury: a single-center case series [^8340fdbd]. Journal of Pain Research (2024). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Central neuropathic pain (CNP) following spinal cord injury (SCI) presents a formidable therapeutic challenge, affecting over 50% of the patients post-SCI. For those who experience CNP, conventional treatments often prove insufficient. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) emerges as a potential intervention for chronic pain after SCI that is unresponsive to pharmacotherapy and supportive measures. However, the efficacy of SCS in alleviating CNP is notably limited. The objective of our study was to evaluate novel stimulation paradigms in SCS for patients with severe CNP after SCI, based on our extensive experience.

Patients and Methods

From a pool of 112 patients treated with SCS for chronic neuropathic pain in the Department of Neurosurgery and Neurology, we selected eight individuals (4 males and 4 females) with CNP for our case series. Burst and high frequency SCS was applied. The assessment involved utilizing the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), the Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory (NPSI), and the EQ-5D quality of life scale before surgery and during a 12-month follow-up period.

Results

Over the course of the one-year follow-up, only two patients experienced satisfactory relief from pain, demonstrating the effectiveness of the stimulation. Moreover, high-frequency and burst SCS failed to show improvement in the remaining six patients.

Conclusion

Our findings suggest that, despite the incorporation of new stimulation paradigms such as burst stimulation and high-frequency stimulation, SCS does not exhibit significant effectiveness in treating neuropathic pain in patients after SCI. These findings highlight the ongoing challenge of treating CNP and emphasize the importance of investigating alternative therapeutic strategies for this group.

### Does a screening trial for spinal cord stimulation in patients with chronic pain of neuropathic origin have clinical utility (TRIAL-STIM)? 36-month results from a randomized controlled trial [^a852ad22]. Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

The use of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) for inhibition of pain was first described in 1967. A number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and economic evaluations support the clinical and cost-effectiveness of SCS for neuropathic pain. -

Despite many advances in SCS waveforms, - target neural tissue, and feedback technology, common to all RCTs to date is that patients are required to undergo a screening trial to evaluate early response to therapy before full implantation of the SCS device. Screening trials are recommended by clinical guidelines and regulators including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States. - Such a screening trial allows patients to experience the sensation generated by SCS and potential pain relief to be achieved. A successful trial has been defined as the patient reporting ≥ 50% pain relief with stable or reduced pain medications and with stable levels of daily activity.

Although a successful screening trial should help to identify those patients who would most benefit from SCS and obtain long-term pain relief, there are drawbacks to such a screening trial strategy. Duplication of a clinical procedure at screening and full implant increase patient exposure to infection (because of bacterial colonization of the lead skin exit site). Higher infection rates have been reported for 28-day trials compared with screening trials with shorter durations.

Furthermore, the results from the TRIAL-STIM RCT showed there was no evidence that a screening trial provides superior patient outcomes or is cost-effective compared with not doing a screening trial. Qualitative results of the TRIAL-STIM also indicated that the patients were not supportive of the concept of a trial.

An important limitation of the TRIAL-STIM RCT results was that follow-up was limited to 6 months and therefore too short to evaluate long-term response to SCS. The aim of this report is, therefore, to report the long-term results of the TRIAL-STIM trial.

### A cost effectiveness analysis of spinal cord stimulation versus conventional medical management for the treatment of low back pain using data from DISTINCT RCT and medical claims from a U.S. commercial payer database [^59203059]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Low back pain (LBP) is a complex condition influenced by various factors including psychological factors, social factors, biophysical factors, comorbidities, and pain-processing mechanisms. It is a prevalent chronic pain condition and a leading cause of global disability. The economic impact encompasses high healthcare costs, lost productivity, and disability payments — impacting individuals, families, employers, healthcare systems, communities, and society at large., Chronic LBP, persisting for 12 weeks or more, is an expensive condition to treat, estimated to cost 12.2–90.6 billion dollars annually in the US, with a lifetime prevalence of 60–85% globally.

Chronic LBP may involve both nociceptive and/or neuropathic pain (NP). Nociceptive pain arises from tissues damaged by physical or chemical agents such as trauma, surgery, or chemical burns. Neuropathic back pain originates from nerve root injury, disease, or pathological innervation of damaged lumbar discs, often posing challenges to detection and management.

The primary treatment goals of chronic LBP are pain reduction, functional improvement, and prevention of future exacerbation. Guidelines recommend a multimodal approach combining pharmacological therapies for symptomatic relief with nonpharmacological interventions, such as physical activity and psychosocial/behavioral approaches. Pharmacotherapy options include acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs, muscle relaxants, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, opioids, and topical treatments. However, oral medications have limited efficacy and are associated with risks including tolerance and addiction with long-term opioid use. Non-pharmacological options like Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS), physiotherapy, interventional procedures (eg, epidural steroid injections (ESIs), radiofrequency ablations and spinal cord stimulation (SCS)) are also considered efficacious.

SCS, particularly passive recharge burst, has emerged as an option for LBP patients unresponsive to conventional medical management.SCS is a form of neurostimulation therapy where electrodes transmit electrical impulses to targeted regions of the spinal cord, altering the way pain signals are processed. SCS has been shown to be effective in treating many chronic and neuropathic pain conditions. Clinical studies show that SCS provides a sustained, long-term, reduction of 50% or greater in over 70% of patients leading to decreased pain medication usage, improved functional status, enabling return to work.

### Invasive brain stimulation for the treatment of neuropathic pain [^54620b95]. Nature Reviews: Neurology (2011). Medium credibility.

Neurostimulation therapy is indicated for neuropathic pain that is refractory to medical treatment, and includes stimulation of the dorsal spinal cord, deep brain structures, and the precentral motor cortex. Spinal cord stimulation is validated in the treatment of selected types of chronic pain syndromes, such as failed back surgery syndrome. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has shown promise as a treatment for peripheral neuropathic pain and phantom limb pain. Compared with DBS, motor cortex stimulation (MCS) is currently more frequently used, mainly because it is more easily performed, and has a wider range of indications (including central poststroke pain). Controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of MCS in the treatment of various types of neuropathic pain, although these trials included a limited number of patients and need to be confirmed by large, controlled, multicenter studies. Despite technical progress in neurosurgical navigation, results from studies of MCS are variable, and validated criteria for selecting good candidates for implantation are lacking. However, the evidence in favor of MCS is sufficient to include it in the range of therapeutic options for refractory neuropathic pain. In this Review, the respective efficacies and mechanisms of action of DBS and MCS are discussed.

### The advancing role of neuromodulation for the management of chronic treatment-refractory pain [^4d4f7292]. Neurosurgery (2017). Low credibility.

Neuropathic pain is a common cause of disability and health care utilization. While judicious pharmacotherapy and management of comorbid psychological distress can provide for improved quality of life, some patients with treatment-refractory disease require more invasive therapies. Spinal cord stimulation can provide for improvement in pain and decrease in medication utilization, with level 1 evidence supporting its use across various pain etiologies including persistent postoperative neuropathic pain, complex regional pain syndrome, chronic inoperable limb ischemia, treatment refractory angina, and painful diabetic neuropathy. These procedures can be done with acceptably low morbidity and provide a cost-effective solution for those patients in whom medical therapies have failed. Technological innovation in lead design, implantable pulse generator capability, and stimulation algorithms and parameters may further enhance the success of this therapy. Neuromodulation of distal targets such as dorsal root ganglion may permit greater anatomic specificity of the therapy, whereas subthreshold stimulation with high-frequency or burst energy delivery may eliminate noxious and off-target paresthesiae. Such new technologies should be subject to rigorous evaluation as their mechanisms of action and long-term outcomes remain hitherto undefined.

### Noninvasive brain stimulation does not improve neuropathic pain in individuals with spinal cord injury: evidence from a meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials [^edccd9c8]. American Journal of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

The aim of the study was to examine the effectiveness of noninvasive brain stimulation on neuropathic pain in individuals with spinal cord injury.

Methods

A meta-analysis on pain intensity, depression, and anxiety levels was conducted to evaluate the effect of noninvasive brain stimulation on neuropathic pain in individuals with spinal cord injury. The authors searched Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase (OvidSP), PsycINFO (OvidSP), and Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro). Randomized controlled trials comparing noninvasive brain stimulation with sham stimulation were included.

Results

Eleven studies were selected. The pooled analysis demonstrated no significant effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, or cranial electrotherapy stimulation on neuropathic pain reduction after spinal cord injury. In addition, noninvasive brain stimulation showed no beneficial effect over sham stimulation on the improvement of depression, while it yielded a significant reduction of anxiety levels immediately after treatment. Subgroup analysis showed that only cranial electrotherapy stimulation had a significant effect on the reduction of anxiety levels among the three types of noninvasive brain stimulation.

Conclusions

In individuals with spinal cord injury, no significant effects of noninvasive brain stimulation on neuropathic pain and depression were observed. Cranial electrotherapy stimulation may be beneficial for the management of anxiety. These findings do not support the routine use of noninvasive brain stimulation for neuropathic pain in individuals with spinal cord injury.

### The canPain SCI clinical practice guidelines for rehabilitation management of neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury: 2021 update [^5fb3d4af]. Spinal Cord (2022). Medium credibility.

The panel emphasized it was, however, still important to acknowledge that certain treatment options had a higher evidence basis and/or strength of recommendation from the expert panel than others (e.g. second-line vs. third- or fourth-line treatments). Thus, a distinction should still be present within the CPG between different groups of treatment options. Given that a hierarchical approach was not used for these treatment groupings, second- to fourth-line treatments were reclassified as "B options" (formerly second-line), "C options" (formerly third-line) and "D options" (formerly fourth-line). The criteria for classifying a treatment within one of these groupings were the same as for second/third/fourth-line treatments, and were based on GRADE/strength of the recommendation as follows (GRADE; strength of recommendation): B options (High/Moderate; Strong); C options (High/Moderate; Weak); D options (Moderate/Low; Weak). The phrasing of recommendations was also standardized to reflect the assessments of the expert panel on the different treatment groupings. B option recommendations are phrased as "can be used" for NP following SCI, while C and D option recommendations are phrased as "may be considered" for NP following SCI.

Although a hierarchy of treatment options was not used, the consensus panel agreed that classifying and phrasing the recommendations in this way would provide adequate clarity and information to the CPG user regarding the panel's assessment and evaluation of different treatment options. Figure 1 presents the treatment recommendations as a diagram; Table 5 presents a full text listing all treatment recommendations.

### EFNS guidelines on neurostimulation therapy for neuropathic pain [^4b2ecc52]. European Journal of Neurology (2007). Low credibility.

Pharmacological relief of neuropathic pain is often insufficient. Electrical neurostimulation is efficacious in chronic neuropathic pain and other neurological diseases. European Federation of Neurological Societies (EFNS) launched a Task Force to evaluate the evidence for these techniques and to produce relevant recommendations. We searched the literature from 1968 to 2006, looking for neurostimulation in neuropathic pain conditions, and classified the trials according to the EFNS scheme of evidence for therapeutic interventions. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is efficacious in failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type I (level B recommendation). High-frequency transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) may be better than placebo (level C) although worse than electro-acupuncture (level B). One kind of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has transient efficacy in central and peripheral neuropathic pains (level B). Motor cortex stimulation (MCS) is efficacious in central post-stroke and facial pain (level C). Deep brain stimulation (DBS) should only be performed in experienced centres. Evidence for implanted peripheral stimulations is inadequate. TENS and r-TMS are non-invasive and suitable as preliminary or add-on therapies. Further controlled trials are warranted for SCS in conditions other than failed back surgery syndrome and CRPS and for MCS and DBS in general. These chronically implanted techniques provide satisfactory pain relief in many patients, including those resistant to medication or other means.

### Parameters of spinal cord stimulation in complex regional pain syndrome: systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials [^8fa0ea1d]. Pain Physician (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic debilitating neuropathic pain condition characterized by autonomic and inflammatory features that typically occurs after a traumatic event. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic CRPS refractory to conventional treatment modalities. The collective evidence of novel parameters of SCS for treating CRPS has not been characterized extensively.

Objective

To provide evidence for the use of SCS to treat CRPS and characterize the additional benefits of various SCS waveforms.

Study Design

Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.

Methods

PubMed, Embase and CINHLA were screened for all randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing SCS parameters for the treatment of CRPS.

Results

Four RCTs were identified that included SCS as a treatment arm for CRPS. Of these, one study compared low frequency tonic SCS (LF-SCS) versus conventional physical therapy, 2 studies compared placebo/sham SCS with LF-SCS and a multitude of waveforms, and one study compared LF-SCS with high-frequency SCS (HF-SCS). Two of the studies were rated as having a low risk of bias, one study was rated as having some concerns for bias, while the final study was rated as having a high risk of bias. A meta-analysis of 4 studies comparing conventional therapy/placebo SCS stimulation against LF-SCS revealed increased benefit of LF-SCS in pain reduction up to a month (mean difference [MD] = -1.17 points; 95% CI = -1.61 to -0.73; P < 0.001, I2 = 42%). Another meta-analysis of 2 studies showed that LF-SCS results in higher global perceived effect scores relative to conventional therapy/placebo SCS stimulation (MD = 1.58; 95% CI = 1.00 to 2.15; P < 0.001, I2 = 0%).

Limitations

A pooled analysis using different designs for RCTs was conducted. Some studies folded in multiple neuropathic pain pathologies in addition to CRPS. One study was at a high risk for bias in at least one domain.

Conclusion

LF-SCS is superior to conventional therapy/placebo SCS stimulation. However, more evidence is required to demonstrate that novel SCS parameters are superior to LF-SCS in improving pain scores and functional outcomes.

### Long-term outcome of spinal cord stimulation in complex regional pain syndrome [^71a4c94e]. Neurosurgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) is a chronic neuropathic disorder with a complex pathophysiology. The worldwide incidence of CRPS is unknown, but an estimated incidence rate of 26.6/100 000 life years has been reported in the population of the Netherlands. The risk of being affected is 3 times greater among females than in males.CRPS is often divided into 2 subcategories: CRPS I, which is formerly known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), in which there is no evidence of nerve lesions, and CRPS II, which is formerly known as Causalgia, in which nerve lesions are present. Both types share similar symptoms, including constant pain, sensory, vasomotor, sudomotor, motor, and trophic changes, which form the diagnostic Budapest criteria for CRPS. The year that a CRPS diagnose is set, the median total costs per patient total $8508, from which $2077 are a result of pain prescriptions. Comorbidities are common in CRPS, and the disease substantially decreases the quality of life.

Strong opioids are not recommended for pain management in CRPS because evidence of their efficiency in relieving neuropathic pain in CRPS is lacking; however, they are still widely used. Opioids have various adverse effects and can lead to opioid abuse, which has contributed to the ongoing opioid crisis. Therefore, we should favor alternative ways to manage pain and avoid indiscriminate pain prescriptions. Here, spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been used for severe CRPS refractory to medical treatment. In prospective studies, there were statistically significant improvements in the visual analog scale (VAS) scores and reduced narcotic use after the beginning of SCS. Altogether, only a few long-term studies, including on medication use, have been made (Table 1). The initial costs may be high, but it is a cost-effective option among carefully selected patients. High-quality evidence of efficacy of SCS in CRPS is still lacking, and multicenter studies would be recommended because of the small number of patients in individual centers.

TABLE 1.
Previous Studies on Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) in Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS)

We present a retrospective collaborative analysis of CRPS patients treated with SCS during an 18-yr period with a median follow-up time of 8 yr. Our objective was to estimate the long-term outcome of SCS in CRPS by measuring the (1) effect on opioid and neuropathic pain medication use before and during SCS, (2) explantation rate, and (3) complications.

### Machine learning in spinal cord stimulation for chronic pain [^d775a7e3]. Operative Neurosurgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an effective treatment for chronic neuropathic pain. The success of SCS is dependent on candidate selection, response to trialing, and programming optimization. Owing to the subjective nature of these variables, machine learning (ML) offers a powerful tool to augment these processes. Here we explore what work has been done using data analytics and applications of ML in SCS. In addition, we discuss aspects of SCS which have narrowly been influenced by ML and propose the need for further exploration. ML has demonstrated a potential to complement SCS to an extent ranging from assistance with candidate selection to replacing invasive and costly aspects of the surgery. The clinical application of ML in SCS shows promise for improving patient outcomes, reducing costs of treatment, limiting invasiveness, and resulting in a better quality of life for the patient.

4.1. Strengths and limitations

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first randomised controlled study to examine the clinical utility and diagnostic value of SCS screening trials. Our study was independently funded and conducted with oversight from a registered clinical trials unit. To date, only 2 other RCTs assessing the impact of SCS have reported industry-independent funding, and both recruited considerably fewer patients from a smaller number of centres. The recruitment from 3 United Kingdom centres makes our findings generalisable to United Kingdom and possibly European practice. In addition, the use of pragmatic inclusion criteria that closely mirror the United Kingdom NICE guidance as well as the use of devices from all major SCS manufacturers ensures that our findings portray the real-world impact of SCS.

We sought to eliminate participant expectation bias through use of a carefully balanced message to participants around the benefits/risks of screening trials. In addition, we blinded observers and analysts to group allocation.

All devices were programmed by pain clinic nurses within the routine clinical setting and at routine clinical review timepoints selected to limit participant burden. Only 2 individual programming appointments occurred outside the study visits.

Finally, this is the first RCT to examine the role of SCS as a generic intervention rather than a device-specific outcome. Spinal cord stimulation devices were programmed to paresthesia, 10 Khz, and burst modes of stimulation. Although the study was not powered to detect statistically significant differences between the 3 programming modalities, we were unable to observe clinically relevant differences.

Our study has some limitations. Due to the nature of the study interventions, we were unable to blind participants or physicians. As this was a pragmatic trial reflecting United Kingdom clinical practice, we did not test for neuropathic pain because NICE guidance does not dictate the use of a test other than clinical diagnosis. Inclusion of a population based on IASP criteria or any specific diagnostic neuropathic pain test may not represent the population treated with SCS in United Kingdom clinical practice thus limiting our ability to influence United Kingdom practice and commissioning. Our findings specifically on the diagnostic utility of the screening trial are compromised by the small number of subjects failing a screening trial as well as the loss to follow-up of 3/5 patients with a failed screening trial. Finally, our findings on the diagnostic utility and cost-effectiveness of screening trials may not be applicable to other healthcare settings (such as United States) where trial success rates are typically much lower than seen in this study and other European settings.

### Evidence-based consensus guidelines on patient selection and trial stimulation for spinal cord stimulation therapy for chronic non-cancer pain [^3c286a39]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has demonstrated effectiveness for neuropathic pain. Unfortunately, some patients report inadequate long-term pain relief. Patient selection is emphasized for this therapy; however, the prognostic capabilities and deployment strategies of existing selection techniques, including an SCS trial, have been questioned. After approval by the Board of Directors of the American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, a steering committee was formed to develop evidence-based guidelines for patient selection and the role of an SCS trial. Representatives of professional organizations with clinical expertize were invited to participate as committee members. A comprehensive literature review was carried out by the steering committee, and the results organized into narrative reports, which were circulated to all the committee members. Individual statements and recommendations within each of seven sections were formulated by the steering committee and circulated to members for voting. We used a modified Delphi method wherein drafts were circulated to each member in a blinded fashion for voting. Comments were incorporated in the subsequent revisions, which were recirculated for voting to achieve consensus. Seven sections with a total of 39 recommendations were approved with 100% consensus from all the members. Sections included definitions and terminology of SCS trial; benefits of SCS trial; screening for psychosocial characteristics; patient perceptions on SCS therapy and the use of trial; other patient predictors of SCS therapy; conduct of SCS trials; and evaluation of SCS trials including minimum criteria for success. Recommendations included that SCS trial should be performed before a definitive SCS implant except in anginal pain (grade B). All patients must be screened with an objective validated instrument for psychosocial factors, and this must include depression (grade B). Despite some limitations, a trial helps patient selection and provides patients with an opportunity to experience the therapy. These recommendations are expected to guide practicing physicians and other stakeholders and should not be mistaken as practice standards. Physicians should continue to make their best judgment based on individual patient considerations and preferences.

### Efficacy and safety of kilohertz frequency alternating current with non-invasive electrodes for treatment of neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury: a randomized, single-blind, sham-controlled study [^4d085e37]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neuropathic pain (NP), mainly caused by spinal cord injury (SCI), impacts 50%–60% of SCI sufferers with severe pain that disrupts daily life. Treatment globally includes various pharmacological options; however, only pregabalin is FDA-approved for SCI-related NP, highlighting a significant gap in standardized treatments and emphasizing the need for more universal therapeutic standards and clinical research.

Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) using kilohertz frequency alternating current (KHFAC), ranging from 1 kHz to 100 kHz, has proven effective in NP management by blocking nerve conduction, demonstrated in both animal studies and early clinical trials. Nevertheless, the clinical adoption of SCS, including invasive dorsal root ganglion (DRG) stimulation, is restricted due to associated surgical risks.

Addressing these limitations, our clinical trial investigates the efficacy and safety of a noninvasive 10 kHz KHFAC DRG stimulation via patch electrodes, compared with sham stimulation alongside medication. This pioneering study is the first to explore noninvasive KHFAC for NP treatment post-SCI, aiming to enhance noninvasive neuromodulation technologies and potentially set new standards in NP care. This trial marks a critical step towards improving clinical outcomes and broadening treatment accessibility for NP patients.

### Spinal cord stimulation for chronic pain of spinal origin: a valuable long-term solution [^ad5db870]. Spine (2002). Low credibility.

Study Design

A literature review was conducted.

Objective

To review the indications and efficacy of spinal cord stimulation, particularly in reference to chronic pain of spinal origin.

Summary Of Background Data

The first spinal cord stimulation was implanted by Shealy in 1967 via a subarachnoid route. Early systems were plagued with a high rate of complications and technical problems. With the evolving technology, especially the advent of multichannel programmable systems and more precise epidural placement, the ability of spinal cord stimulation to treat various pain syndromes improved. This article reviews the literature on spinal cord stimulation from 1967 to the present.

Methods

The literature is reviewed, with a particular focus on recent studies investigating the efficacy of spinal cord stimulation for low back pain.

Results

Most studies are limited by the same flaws, namely, retrospective study design. At this writing, the few published randomized prospective studies have suggested that spinal cord stimulation may be superior to repeat surgery. Complication rates have declined to approximately 8%, and reoperation is necessary in approximately 4% of patients. When current percutaneous techniques are used, a lead migration rate lower than 3% may be achieved. For certain topographies, laminotomy leads may be superior, particularly with regard to low back pain.

Conclusions

The ultimate efficacy of spinal cord stimulation remains to be determined, primarily because of limitations associated with the published literature. However, on the basis of the current evidence, it may represent a valuable treatment option, particularly for patients with chronic pain of predominantly neuropathic origin and topographical distribution involving the extremities. The potential treatment of other pain topographies and etiologies by spinal cord stimulation continues to be studied.

### Transcranial direct current stimulation for the management of neuropathic pain: a narrative review [^2ec98ea8]. Pain Physician (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Neuropathic pain (NP) is common and often resistant to conventional analgesics. Among different types of noninvasive brain stimulation techniques, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been widely used to mitigate pain in patients with NP.

Objective

The aim of this study was to review the effects of tDCS on the management of various types of NP.

Study Design

Narrative review.

Methods

A PubMed search was conducted for articles published until October 1, 2020, using tDCS to treat NP. The key search phrase, transcranial direct current stimulation and pain, was used to identify potentially relevant articles. The following inclusion criteria were applied for article selection: (1) studies involving patients with NP and (2) studies that used tDCS to treat NP. Review articles were excluded from the analysis.

Results

A total of 524 potentially relevant articles were identified. After reading the titles and abstracts and assessing eligibility based on the full-text articles, 34 publications were included in our review. Overall, our results suggest that tDCS induced pain reduction in patients with NP due to stroke or spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, or trigeminal neuralgia. There is insufficient evidence to validate the efficacy of tDCS for treating other painful conditions, such as complex regional pain syndrome, phantom pain, or NP of various origins.

Limitations

The review did not include studies indexed in databases other than PubMed.

Conclusion

The results of the included studies suggest that tDCS may be beneficial in treating patients with NP due to stroke, spinal cord injury, multiple sclerosis, and trigeminal neuralgia. Further studies are recommended to validate the efficacy of tDCS in treating other types of NPs.

### Pharmacology and treatment of neuropathic pains [^f5c9c777]. Current Opinion in Neurology (2009). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

This review briefly discusses the definition and clinical presentation of neuropathic pain and highlights recent advances in the treatment of neuropathic pain.

Recent Findings

Recent publications have confirmed the efficacy of tricyclic antidepressants, gabapentin, pregabalin, opioids, and tramadol for various neuropathic pain conditions. Selective serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors have been found to reduce pain in painful neuropathy. The new anticonvulsant lacosamide may have some effect in painful polyneuropathy, whereas levetiracetam has failed to relieve postmastectomy and spinal cord injury pain. The role of the old anticonvulsant phenytoin is still unsettled. A recent trial has found an effect of cannabinoids also in peripheral neuropathic pain. Various topical treatments such as topical lidocaine, topically applied capsaicin in high concentrations (8%), and botulinum toxin have recently been shown to have a pain-relieving effect in various peripheral neuropathic pain conditions. Spinal cord and transcranial magnetic stimulation are stimulation therapies with some evidence for efficacy.

Summary

Treating neuropathic pain remains a great challenge, and the treatment has to be individualized to the single patient, taking into account side effects, pain type, comorbidities, and drug interactions.

### Spinal cord stimulation for neuropathic pain: current perspectives [^4cddd223]. Journal of Pain Research (2014). Low credibility.

Long-term outcomes and place in therapy

Outcomes of SCS therapy have considerably improved over the course of the last 30 years. Although in the 1970s about 40% of the patients achieved pain relief of more than 50%, this percentage in recent studies is more than 70%. Proper patient selection and meticulous preoperative diagnostics, including psychological assessment, are crucial for the success of the method. Moreover, more knowledge regarding promising indications has been gathered over the course of the years. SCS therapy today is not necessarily seen as a therapy of last resort, but as an effective possibility to overcome pain that would otherwise be difficult to treat. Unsuccessful conventional medical management is regarded as a criterion in favor of an SCS trial. However, most of the guidelines do not state whether or not opioids, particularly strong opioids, should be employed. Today, many pain physicians probably would not insist on a prior therapeutic attempt with highly potent opioids, and SCS would be ranked in the therapeutic order between weak and strong opioids. At any rate, the disadvantages of long-term opioid therapyshould be weighed against those of SCS therapy. SCS can certainly be used together with analgetic medications, but in an optimal setting, SCS can make pain medication redundant. Often, however, patients continue to take analgetic medications. For instance, in a study on 60 consecutive patients, 16% of the patients took no analgetics at all after SCS implantation, whereas more than half of the patients took two or more different analgetics.

Another important point is the duration of conservative therapy before SCS implantation. Kumar et al observed an inverse correlation between the long-term success rate and the time interval between the onset of the chronic pain syndrome and SCS implantation. They noted that the success rate in patients who received their SCS system within the first 2 years of their pain syndrome was 85%, whereas the success rate was 9% in patients with a more than 15-year history of chronic pain. As a consequence, an SCS trial should be performed within the first 2 years after onset of pain. In contrast, also less invasive therapies should have been tried before an SCS trial, so realistically, SCS will rarely be applied earlier than 6–12 months from the onset of pain. Anyway, also a recent review concluded that SCS for CRPS "should be considered earlier than last resort therapy".

### Burst spinal cord stimulation: a systematic review and pooled analysis of real-world evidence and outcomes data [^136b6791]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Since 1967, spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been providing relief for neuropathic pain that is otherwise refractory to conventional treatments. Conventional SCS delivers short pulses (approximately 200 µsec) of electricity to the dorsal surface of the spinal cord in a tonic — constant, unchanging — fashion, typically at approximately 40 Hz. Considerable work has demonstrated the value of this intervention.

After decades with tonic stimulation as the only SCS option, albeit with dramatic advances in technology, implantation procedures, and programming options, in 2010 a new SCS waveform emerged. Termed "burst" SCS, it delivers packets of five longer (1,000 µsec) pulses at 500 Hz, with the bursts repeated at 40 Hz. Monophasic charge accumulation occurs during the burst packet; this accumulation passively discharges during the interburst quiescent period. Despite requiring amplitudes much lower than for tonic SCS, burst SCS delivers more electrical current per second than tonic SCS. Burst SCS is ideally paresthesia-free when properly administered.

### Study protocol: single-blinded, controlled, clinical trial evaluating the feasibility of spinal cord stimulation for improving neuropathic pain and rehabilitation outcomes in patients with thoracic spinal cord injury [^5a62a9c8]. Neurosurgery Practice (2025). Medium credibility.

STUDY GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

We have begun enrollment in a prospective clinical trial of dual paddle lead (thoracic and conus medullaris) SCS implantation in patients with SCI, with devices simultaneously turned on or off. The primary objective of this trial was to determine if SCS is a safe, feasible, and an effective option for decreasing neuropathic pain in patients living with traumatic thoracic SCI.

The secondary objective was to investigate the utility of conus SCS for improving neurorehabilitation outcomes. Secondary outcomes include the change in the following variables from baseline to 3 months: American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) impairment scale and grade (A-E), Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM), Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain, pain medication use, Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) scale, Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS)-29 + 2 survey, bladder diaries, muscle activity and force, harness-supported walking, and medications. We hypothesize that SCS will lead to measurable improvements in neuropathic pain and potentially improve patients' sensorimotor function, bladder incontinence, and overall quality of life. The conus stimulator is investigational and has been approved by the FDA to use as an investigational product.

### Spinal cord stimulation in complex regional pain syndrome and refractory neuropathic back and leg pain / failed back surgery syndrome: results of a systematic review and meta-analysis [^f85c13df]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2006). Low credibility.

The drive for good quality evidence has highlighted the importance of well-conducted systematic reviews and meta-analyses that critically evaluate and grade studies for new or existing therapies. A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to review the efficacy, safety, and cost effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) in complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) and refractory neuropathic back and leg pain/failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS). The results support the use of SCS in patients with refractory neuropathic back and leg pain/FBSS (Grade B evidence) and CRPS type I (Grade A evidence)/type II (Grade D evidence). SCS not only reduces pain, improves quality of life, reduces analgesic consumption, and allows some patients to return to work, with minimal significant adverse events, but may also result in significant cost savings over time.

### Disease applications of spinal cord stimulation: chronic nonmalignant pain [^e73cf65d]. Neurotherapeutics (2024). Medium credibility.

Methods

We performed a literature review on bibliographic resources, including EMBASE, PubMed Cochrane Database of Systemic Reviews from literature published from January 2000 to 2023 to identify studies and treatments using SCS to treat chronic pain. Search words included SCS, chronic pain treatment, failed back surgery syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease. The search was limited to the English language, excluding case reports, reviews or preclinical work, limiting the results to trials and original studies only. Information on emerging technologies (e.g. trial using devices in experimental stage) was captured separately, as they did not meet the inclusion criteria. A total of 1000 citations were identified. After combining the results, removing duplicates and selections based on the title and abstract, 39 full-text studies ultimately remained and were included in the review. Case vignettes in each different pain condition are provided.

### Burst spinal cord stimulation: a clinical review [^60228208]. Pain Medicine (2019). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

There is a high level of clinical evidence for the efficacy of burst SCS on pain intensity after one year of therapy in patients suffering from a variety of chronic pain conditions. Moreover, there are many blinded, sham-controlled RCTs indicating clinical superiority over both placebo and tonic SCS. In addition to high-quality data from controlled trials, there is a plethora of evidence from observational studies that demonstrates that burst SCS produces improvement, not only in pain intensity but over a range of other clinically meaningful patient-reported outcomes. Multiple sources of evidence suggest that burst SCS appears to interfere with the affective component of pain perception, indicating that unique changes in the central processing of pain are induced by this therapy.

The overall level of evidence in trials reviewed for this paper is variable, ranging from high-quality prospective trials with long follow-up periods to a number of low- to medium-quality trials. Randomized trials comparing different stimulation patterns powering for affective components of pain are needed to confirm the reported positive effects in prior reports. Although there are data on a variety of neuropathic pain conditions, future studies should also better focus on individual pain conditions, like FNSS, CRPS, peripheral neuropathies, postsurgical chronic pain, ischemic pain conditions, visceral pain, and central pain conditions (e.g. poststroke pain). A comprehensive means to approach this is bundling the existing data in an international database and running registry-based RCTs. In this manner, new indications can be studied in real-world populations with a long follow-up period, gaining increasing clinical evidence levels.

It will be useful to best understand patient phenotypes that may best respond to burst SCS either before receiving any form of neuromodulation, or as a secondary attempt at regaining analgesia in patients losing efficacy with tonic or HF-SCS. Real-time pain intensity recording, validated questionnaires in affective pain perception, real-time functional outcome measures (e.g. pedometry and sleep quality), and standardized additional investigation (e.g. neuroimaging, neuro-electrophysiology, biometrics) may help in this process and push personalized pain therapies forward.

### The American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) guidelines and consensus on the definition, current evidence, clinical use and future applications for physiologic closed-loop controlled neuromodulation in chronic pain: a NEURON group project [^a3e4dc46]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Neuromodulation has been a staple of treatment for moderate-to-severe chronic refractory pain since the introduction of the first spinal cord stimulator by Norman Shealy in 1967. Appreciating the dynamic nature of electrical modulation of the nervous system from the epidural space, the goal has been consistent, reliable, and therapeutic neural activation of the spinal cord. This has proven to be extremely difficult. Recently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released a guidance on physiologic closed loop controlled (PCLC) devices, highlighting the potential for these therapies to deliver accurate, consistent, real-time therapy, enhancing medical care and reducing variability. Because of the growing neuromodulation market focus on PCLC strategies, the American Society of Pain and Neuroscience (ASPN) sought to develop guidance on safety and efficacy, along with a taxonomy surrounding PCLC systems (PCLCSs) and to develop an evidence-based best practice review.

Methods

A librarian-assisted literature search was performed to identify manuscripts relevant to the topic of PCLC stimulation for management of chronic pain. Initial literature search was performed utilizing MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane database, BioMed Central, and Web of Science. Included manuscripts encompassed meta-analyses, systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective or retrospective studies with follow-up to 12 months, limited to the English language. MESH terms utilized included "closed-loop", "physiologic closed loop controlled", "spinal cord stimulation", "closed loop feedback", "feedback controlled", "neuromodulation", "pain", "persistent pain", "neuropathic pain", and "chronic pain". The modified USPSTF evidence and recommendation grading strategy previously utilized was again employed.

Results

Four studies were identified for review, 2 prospective, one retrospective, and one randomized controlled study with at least 12-month follow-up.

Conclusion

PCLC neuromodulation is an innovation that requires a responsible introduction. As commercial access grows, there is a responsibility that requires consistency with definition, evidence generation, focused on safety and efficacy.

### Modulating neuroplasticity for chronic pain relief: noninvasive neuromodulation as a promising approach [^4477aaf7]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Pain is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain as "an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with actual or potential tissue damage, or described in terms of such damage". Within the broader field of pain research, chronic neuropathic pain has garnered notable attention because of its high prevalence, complex mechanisms and profound impact on quality of life. Neuropathic pain arises from various conditions, including spinal cord injuries, peripheral nerve damage and diseases such as multiple sclerosis and diabetes. According to the World Health Organization, chronic pain affects approximately one in five people in the general population. Therefore, the World Health Organization designates chronic pain, including neuropathic pain, as a global health priority, given its widespread impact and the challenges associated with its management. Chronic neuropathic pain is increasingly recognized as a neuroplasticity disorder caused by excitatory and inhibitory imbalances in pain processing pathways. Its severity depends on numerous biological, physiological and psychological factors. A key aspect of neuropathic pain is central sensitization, a form of maladaptive neuroplasticity that amplifies pain signaling in the central nervous system (CNS). Importantly, modulating this unhelpful neuroplasticity can potentially alleviate persistent pain symptoms and restore normal functioning, promoting adaptive changes.

Researchers have employed various in vivo pain models, including models of peripheral nerve injury, spinal cord injury and chemotherapy-induced neuropathy, to study the mechanisms related to central sensitization in patients with neuropathic pain. These models have provided valuable insights into the molecular and cellular changes underlying neuropathic pain, such as altered ion channel expression, increased synaptic efficacy, and changes in descending pain modulation pathways. Despite the availability of various therapeutic modalities, the treatment of chronic neuropathic pain remains challenging. Current treatment approaches include the following: (1) pharmacological interventions such as anti-epileptic drugs (for example, gabapentin and pregabalin), antidepressants (for example, duloxetine and amitriptyline) and opioid/opioid-like analgesic agents; (2) invasive procedures such as spinal cord stimulation, dorsal root ganglion (DRG) stimulation and deep brain stimulation; (3) physical therapies such as physical rehabilitation, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and acupuncture; and (4) psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness-based stress reduction. However, these treatments often have limitations. Pharmacological approaches can lead to side effects such as drowsiness, dizziness and potential addiction. Invasive procedures carry risks of infection, bleeding and device-related complications. Moreover, the efficacy of these treatments can vary and often diminishes over time.

### EAN guidelines on central neurostimulation therapy in chronic pain conditions [^1a2e2436]. European Journal of Neurology (2016). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Our aim was to update previous European Federation of Neurological Societies guidelines on neurostimulation for neuropathic pain, expanding the search to new techniques and to chronic pain conditions other than neuropathic pain, and assessing the evidence with the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system.

Methods

A systematic review and meta-analysis of trials published between 2006 and December 2014 was conducted. Pain conditions included neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type I and post-surgical chronic back and leg pain (CBLP). Spinal cord stimulation (SCS), deep brain stimulation (DBS), epidural motor cortex stimulation (MCS), repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial direct electrical stimulation (tDCS) of the primary motor cortex (M1) or dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) were assessed. The GRADE system was used to assess quality of evidence and propose recommendations.

Results

The following recommendations were reached: 'weak' for SCS added to conventional medical management in diabetic painful neuropathy, CBLP and CRPS, for SCS versus reoperation in CBLP, for MCS in neuropathic pain, for rTMS of M1 in neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia and for tDCS of M1 in neuropathic pain; 'inconclusive' for DBS in neuropathic pain, rTMS and tDCS of the DLPFC, and for motor cortex tDCS in fibromyalgia and spinal cord injury pain.

Conclusions

Given the poor to moderate quality of evidence identified by this review, future large-scale multicentre studies of non-invasive and invasive neurostimulation are encouraged. The collection of higher quality evidence of the predictive factors for the efficacy of these techniques, such as the duration, quality and severity of pain, is also recommended.

### Compound action potentials recorded in the human spinal cord during neurostimulation for pain relief [^4e06a336]. Pain (2012). Low credibility.

Electrical stimulation of the spinal cord provides effective pain relief to hundreds of thousands of chronic neuropathic pain sufferers. The therapy involves implantation of an electrode array into the epidural space of the subject and then stimulation of the dorsal column with electrical pulses. The stimulation depolarises axons and generates propagating action potentials that interfere with the perception of pain. Despite the long-term clinical experience with spinal cord stimulation, the mechanism of action is not understood, and no direct evidence of the properties of neurons being stimulated has been presented. Here we report novel measurements of evoked compound action potentials from the spinal cords of patients undergoing stimulation for pain relief. The results reveal that Aβ sensory nerve fibres are recruited at therapeutic stimulation levels and the Aβ potential amplitude correlates with the degree of coverage of the painful area. Aβ-evoked responses are not measurable below a threshold stimulation level, and their amplitude increases with increasing stimulation current. At high currents, additional late responses are observed. Our results contribute towards efforts to define the mechanism of spinal cord stimulation. The minimally invasive recording technique we have developed provides data previously obtained only through microelectrode techniques in spinal cords of animals. Our observations also allow the development of systems that use neuronal recording in a feedback loop to control neurostimulation on a continuous basis and deliver more effective pain relief. This is one of numerous benefits that in vivo electrophysiological recording can bring to a broad range of neuromodulation therapies.

Spinal Cord Stimulation

Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an established therapy for many forms of chronic neuropathic pain, particularly failed back surgery syndrome and complex regional pain syndrome. Annually, over 30,000 individuals receive SCS implantation for chronic pain, with sales exceeding 1.8 billion dollars. Being a massive, multi-billion dollar industry has helped fuel numerous clinical trials and technical advancements in the field. SCS is also under investigation for other indications, including recovery after spinal cord injury and gait impairment in PD.

Spinal cord stimulation is performed by placing electrodes in the epidural space over the dorsal aspect of the spinal cord, at a level that corresponds to the affected dermatomes to be modulated. In most cases, the electrodes are externalized, and the patient undergoes a trial period of stimulation to ensure adequate pain relief prior to internalization and connection to an implanted pulse generator. Traditional SCS is performed with tonic stimulation delivered at 40–60 hertz, set at an amplitude sufficient to elicit mild but non-bothersome paresthesias.

Mechanistically, SCS was originally thought to work as an application of the gate control theory of pain, whereby stimulation of interneurons in the substantia gelatinosa inhibits ascending pain pathways, essentially blocking painful neuropathic pain signals. In favor of this, programming a spinal cord stimulator involves selecting stimulation settings that induce parasthesias in the patient's painful dermatome-a sign that the SCS is potentially blocking painful sensory transmission. However, newer parasthesia-free stimulation paradigms have been introduced, including high-frequency stimulation (> 400 ​Hz, sometimes as high as 10,000 ​Hz) and burst-stimulation, challenging the gate control theory of pain as a mechanistic explanation. These paradigms seem to result in similar efficacy rates, and raise the question of whether other theories, such as supraspinal pathways or segmental modulation of neuroglia, could explain the effect of SCS. High-frequency and burst stimulation paradigms are sometimes capable of rescuing recurrent pain in patients who had previously benefiting from traditional SCS.

### A call to action toward optimizing the electrical dose received by neural targets in spinal cord stimulation therapy for neuropathic pain [^ed47c677]. Journal of Pain Research (2021). Medium credibility.

In the last decade, innovations in SCS have led to the development of new electrical waveforms. Where SCS was once limited to square pulses delivered in a consistent stream at a set frequency (2–1,200 Hz), pulse width (1–1,000 microseconds), and amplitude (0–20 mA), these programming parameters are still commonly used today, but are now often referred to as "traditional tonic stimulation." New stimulation patterns and frequencies now include burst SCS (pulsatile packets of stimulation with different charge recovery strategies) and high-frequency SCS, the definition of which is contentious: some claim it to have a low range of 1kHz, while others claim it needs to be > 1.2 kHz, the traditional upper limit of most commercially available implantable pulse generators, yet others claim it refers only to stimulation of 5–10kHz. Examples are shown in Figure 1. High-density or high-dose SCS, in which longer pulse widths and/or higher frequencies are used, has also shown clinical utility. Beyond just programming parameter changes, devices that target novel anatomical structures, such as the dorsal root ganglion, have been approved by regulatory bodies all over the world. Multiple detailed reviews have been published on putative mechanisms of action specific to these various approaches. With this range of interventions and programming strategies available, clinicians must stay abreast of the comprehensive body of literature supporting each therapeutic approach to guide selection of the most appropriate therapy for a given patient. Once a therapy is chosen, similar to pharmacological treatment, the appropriate electrical dosage must be prescribed/titrated by programming the device with the correct number and polarity of active electrodes along with the appropriate settings for pulse width, frequency, amplitude, and duty cycling (the percentage of "stimulation-on" time). This concept is summarized in Figure 2.

The aim of this study is to summarize published and evidence based guidelines with regards to utilizing SCS, including patient selection, disease indication, perioperative management, complication mitigation strategies, and device selection. Additional focus has been provided on quality care to individual patients by acknowledging the importance of durable outcomes and care delivery costs.

Summary Of Background Data

For more than 30 years, SCS has successfully alleviated patient suffering and enhanced the lives of patients with refractory pain conditions. Prospective studies of SCS have consistently demonstrated benefits through reduction of pain, improvement in function, and reduced healthcare expenditures in select patient diagnosis groups. Although the benefits of SCS are well-supported, the clinical application of this therapy varies widely based on physician training and experience, regional clinical practice variations, and insurance coverage.

Methods

This article provides a summary of published studies, case reports, evidence-based guidelines and expert consensus, with the intent of increasing physician competency and enhancing patient care through improved clinical outcomes.

Results

A guide to SCS implantation, appropriate patient selection, ranked recommendations for diseases that may most benefit for SCS treatment, complication mitigation strategies, and finally, indications for choosing the most efficacious modality of SCS therapy for specific patients and pain conditions.

Conclusion

Although SCS has been shown to be safe and effective for a number of pain conditions, emerging SCS modalities promise even greater efficacy over traditional SCS. To achieve this promise, physicians must carefully select and manage their patients and the SCS device.

### Spinal cord stimulation for nonspecific limb pain versus neuropathic pain and spontaneous versus evoked pain [^e8b6dcf6]. Neurosurgery (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To compare the outcome of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) in patients with nonspecific limb pain versus patients with neuropathic pain syndromes and in patients with spontaneous versus evoked pain.

Methods

A retrospective review of 122 patients accepted for treatment with SCS between January 1990 and December 1998 was conducted. All patients first underwent a trial of SCS with a monopolar epidural electrode. Seventy-four patients had a successful trial and underwent permanent implantation of the monopolar electrode used for the trial (19 patients), or a quadripolar electrode (53 patients), or a Resume quadripolar electrode via laminotomy (2 patients).

Results

Of the 74 patients, 60.7% underwent implantation of a permanent device and were followed for an average of 3.9 years (range, 0.3–9 yr). Early failure (within 1 yr) occurred in 20.3% of patients, and late failure (after 1 yr) occurred in 33.8% of patients. Overall, 45.9% of patients were still receiving SCS at latest follow-up. Successful SCS (> 50% reduction in pain for 1 yr) occurred in 83.3% of patients with nonspecific leg pain, 89.5% of patients with limb pain associated with root injury, and 73.9% of patients with nerve neuropathic pain. SCS was less effective for the control of allodynia or hyperpathia than for spontaneous pain associated with neuropathic pain syndromes. Third-party involvement did not influence outcome. There was a lesser incidence of surgical revisions when quadripolar leads were used than with monopolar electrodes.

Conclusion

SCS is as effective for treating nonspecific limb pain as it is for treating neuropathic pain, including limb pain associated with root damage.

### Painful peripheral neuropathies of the lower limbs and / or lower extremities treated with spinal cord stimulation: a systematic review with narrative synthesis [^7dd2ea9a]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Traditional SCS (t-SCS)

Among the studies that documented the use of t-SCS in PDN subjects, 2 open-label, multicenter RCTs compared CMM (also known as best medical treatment) with and without adjunctive t-SCS. A further 5 prospective studiesand 2 retrospective reviews, also observed the outcomes of t-SCS treatment.

Randomized Controlled Trials

In the larger RCT by de Vos et al, 40 individuals were assigned to CMM with adjunctive t-SCS and 20 to CMM alone. Participants were refractory to conservative treatments and had an average VAS pain score ≥ 50 points (0–100 points scale), with upper limb neuropathic pain ≤ 20 points at rest. Subjects with inadequate improvement could cross over to the other treatment arm after 6 months. Of the 40 individuals assigned to t-SCS, 37 were converted to a permanent system after a successful trial; however, one individual dropped out early after choosing to enter another study.

In the ITT analysis with last observation carried forward (LOCF), subjects in the t-SCS group reported a 55% decrease in average pain score after 6 months of treatment compared with no pain relief in the CMM group (p < 0.001). Furthermore, 60% of the stimulation-treated subjects (25 of 40) in this analysis had ≥ 50% pain relief compared with only 5% of the control group (1 of 20) (p < 0.001). Relative to the number of implanted subjects with available data, the t-SCS responder rate was 69% (25 of 36). In addition, investigators observed significantly improved HR-QoL and pain characteristics among the t-SCS group on various scales (EQ-5D; MPQ-QoL, McGill Pain Questionnaire-Quality of Life; MPQ, McGill Pain Questionnaire pain quality). Neurological outcomes were not reported.

### Long-term outcome of spinal cord stimulation in complex regional pain syndrome [^63916b41]. Neurosurgery (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an effective treatment in chronic neuropathic pain, but its efficacy in complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) needs to be proven.

Objective

To study the outcome of SCS in CRPS as measured by trial success, explantation rate, complications, and changes in opioid and neuropathic pain medication use over a 4-yr follow-up.

Methods

We retrospectively reviewed all medical records of 35 consecutive CRPS patients who underwent SCS trials at 2 hospitals during January 1998 to December 2016. The purchase data of opioids and neuropathic pain medication during January 1995 to March 2016 were retrieved from national registries.

Results

Based on a 1-wk trial, permanent SCS was implanted in 27 (77%) patients. During the median follow-up of 8 yr, 8 (30%) SCS devices were explanted, of which 7 were because of inefficient pain relief. Complications leading to revision occurred in 17 (63%) patients: 8 electrode migrations or stimulation to the wrong area, 1 deep infection, 9 hardware malfunctions, 2 pulse generator discomforts, and 2 SCS replacements. None of the 6 patients using strong opioids discontinued their use during the 2-yr follow-up. The mean opioid dose increased nonsignificantly both in patients with SCS in permanent use (53 ± 150 morphine milligram equivalents morphine milligram equivalent (MME)/day to 120 ± 240 MME/day) and in patients who had SCS explanted (27 ± 72 MME/day to 57 ± 66 MME/day).

Conclusion

Despite the fact that CRPS patients were not able to discontinue or reduce their strong opioid or neuropathic pain medication use, 70% continued to use their SCS device during a median 8-yr follow-up.

### Spinal cord stimulation for chronic pain syndromes: a review of considerations in practice management [^d69fc32a]. Pain Physician (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Chronic pain syndromes are clinically challenging to treat, and management with opioid medications is increasingly shown to be inappropriate and ineffective. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) has been demonstrated across numerous high-quality and well-designed studies to be effective in treating various refractory chronic pain. The efficacy and overall success of SCS is highly dependent on compliance to and consideration of various practice patterns.

Objective

This manuscript is intended to compile and present comprehensive recommendations for key SCS management principles including: a) patient selection criteria, b) efficacy of SCS for various conditions, c) discussion of SCS waveforms, d) trial and permanent implantation considerations, e) periprocedural management, and f) complications and adverse events.

Study Design

An evidence-based narrative review.

Methods

PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library, prior systematic reviews, and reference lists were screened by 2 separate authors for all randomized trials, meta-analyses, and observational studies relevant to each of the aforementioned management principles and considered for study inclusion.

Results

All high-level evidence studies that explored the various facets of SCS practice management were included for review.

Limitations

Both continued investigation into, and practice implementation of, the various facets of SCS management are necessary to optimize patient outcomes.

Conclusion

Implementation of and adherence to the evidenced-based recommendations delineated in this publication may help optimize efficacy outcomes and maintain safety profiles for persons treated with SCS interventions.

### Multicolumn spinal cord stimulation for predominant back pain in failed back surgery syndrome patients: a multicenter randomized controlled trial [^5e082ff0]. Pain (2019). Medium credibility.

Despite optimal medical management (OMM), low back pain (LBP) can be disabling, particularly after spinal surgery. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is effective in reducing neuropathic leg pain; however, evidence is limited for LBP. This prospective, open-label, parallel-group trial randomized (1:1) failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) patients with predominant LBP to SCS plus OMM (SCS group) or OMM alone (OMM group) at 28 sites in Europe and the Americas. If trial stimulation was successful, a multicolumn SCS system was implanted. Outcomes were assessed at baseline (before randomization) and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after randomization. Patients could change treatment groups at 6 months. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with ≥ 50% reduction in LBP (responder) at 6 months. Secondary outcomes included change in pain intensity, functional disability, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The results are posted at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration number NCT01697358. In the intent-to-treat analysis, there were more responders in the SCS group than in the OMM group (13.6%, 15/110 vs 4.6%, 5/108, difference 9% with 95% confidence interval 0.6%-17.5%, P = 0.036) at 6 months. The SCS group improved in all secondary outcomes compared with the OMM group. The OMM group only improved in HRQoL. In the SCS group, 17.6% (18/102) experienced SCS-related adverse events through 6 months, with 11.8% (12/102) requiring surgical reintervention. Adding multicolumn SCS to OMM improved pain relief, HRQoL, and function in a traditionally difficult-to-treat population of failed back surgery syndrome patients with predominant LBP. Improvements were sustained at 12 and 24 months.

### Efficacy and safety of magnetic peripheral nerve stimulation for treatment of neuropathic pain; one year follow up of long-term outcomes [^42e64721]. Journal of Pain Research (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Chronic neuropathic pain remains a significant clinical challenge, profoundly affecting patients' quality of life by contributing to emotional distress and social limitations. Despite the variety of available treatments, their effectiveness is often insufficient for individuals with severe and persistent pain. Improvements in the quality of the development and presentation of clinical practice guidelines are needed, in addition to more efficacy evidence for the management of patients with neuropathic pain. Common pharmacological approaches, including, antidepressants, membrane stabilizers, and opioid analgesics, demonstrate limited success, with high number of patients needed to treat to achieve meaningful pain relief. More invasive strategies, such as nerve denervation or implantation of neuromodulation devices like subcutaneous peripheral nerve stimulation, lack sufficient long-term efficacy data.

Magnetic Peripheral Nerve Stimulation (mPNS) has received FDA clearance for managing chronic and intractable post-traumatic, post-surgical neuropathic pain and painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN) of the lower extremities. Results from a recent multi-center RCT demonstrated superiority of using mPNS together with conventional medical management (CMM) over Sham+CMM for treating PDN. This technique utilizes biphasic, time-varying magnetic pulses to generate strong electrical fields in targeted nerve bundles, aiming to activate both peripheral and central nervous system pathways. With a typical frequency range of 0.2 to 5 Hz, commonly applied at 0.5 Hz, mPNS is designed to elicit neuronal responses without causing significant discomfort. The differential recruitment of nerve fibers — favoring A-beta sensory fibers over A-delta pain fibers — contributes to its tolerability, in contrast to conventional electrical PNS or transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), which may lead to increased pain sensitivity.

mPNS is administered in structured sessions, beginning with three applications in the first week, followed by a decreasing frequency over the trial period. This approach allows for the reducing pain signaling through both ascending and descending neural pathways. Alternative neuromodulation strategies, such as percutaneous electrical PNS or spinal cord stimulation (SCS), necessitate operation below the motor threshold to avoid patient discomfort, whereas mPNS offers a non-invasive, well-tolerated alternative.

Given the need for rigorous clinical evaluation, this clinical trial (the SEAT study) aimed to compare the safety and efficacy of mPNS combined with CMM to CMM alone in patients with chronic peripheral neuropathic pain. This manuscript provides a longer follow up (12 months) compared to the original publication of the 90 day data.

### Spinal cord stimulation does not change peripheral skin blood flow in patients with neuropathic pain [^a5a4d1b5]. European Journal of Anaesthesiology (2003). Low credibility.

Background and Objective

Spinal cord stimulation has been used successfully for many years in the management of neuropathic pain. Nociceptive pathways are closely integrated into many autonomic reflexes. The aim was to test the hypothesis that pain relief caused by spinal cord stimulation is related to changes in peripheral skin blood flow.

Methods

Twelve patients with spinal cord stimulators implanted as a treatment for neuropathic pain were entered into the study. Laser Doppler perfusion scanning was used as a direct method for selective measurement of changes in skin (peripheral) blood flow. Measurements were taken before and after the onset of spinal cord stimulation over the site of its sensory projection. The degree of pain relief due to spinal cord stimulation and the skin temperature of each patient were also recorded.

Results

Apart from one patient, spinal cord stimulation did not change skin blood flow in a statistically significant manner.

Conclusions

Pain relief due to spinal cord stimulation is not related to changes of skin blood flow.

### Effectiveness of transcranial direct current stimulation and visual illusion on neuropathic pain in spinal cord injury [^79b256cc]. Brain (2010). Low credibility.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the analgesic effect of transcranial direct current stimulation of the motor cortex and techniques of visual illusion, applied isolated or combined, in patients with neuropathic pain following spinal cord injury. In a sham controlled, double-blind, parallel group design, 39 patients were randomized into four groups receiving transcranial direct current stimulation with walking visual illusion or with control illusion and sham stimulation with visual illusion or with control illusion. For transcranial direct current stimulation, the anode was placed over the primary motor cortex. Each patient received ten treatment sessions during two consecutive weeks. Clinical assessment was performed before, after the last day of treatment, after 2 and 4 weeks follow-up and after 12 weeks. Clinical assessment included overall pain intensity perception, Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory and Brief Pain Inventory. The combination of transcranial direct current stimulation and visual illusion reduced the intensity of neuropathic pain significantly more than any of the single interventions. Patients receiving transcranial direct current stimulation and visual illusion experienced a significant improvement in all pain subtypes, while patients in the transcranial direct current stimulation group showed improvement in continuous and paroxysmal pain, and those in the visual illusion group improved only in continuous pain and dysaesthesias. At 12 weeks after treatment, the combined treatment group still presented significant improvement on the overall pain intensity perception, whereas no improvements were reported in the other three groups. Our results demonstrate that transcranial direct current stimulation and visual illusion can be effective in the management of neuropathic pain following spinal cord injury, with minimal side effects and with good tolerability.

### Painful peripheral neuropathies of the lower limbs and / or lower extremities treated with spinal cord stimulation: a systematic review with narrative synthesis [^69ef55be]. Journal of Pain Research (2023). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Painful peripheral neuropathy (PPN) is a debilitating condition with varied etiologies. Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is increasingly used when conservative treatments fail to provide adequate pain relief. Few published reviews have examined SCS outcomes in all forms of PPN.

Methods

We conducted a systematic review of SCS in PPN. The PubMed database was searched up to February 7th, 2022, for peer-reviewed studies of SCS that enrolled PPN patients with pain symptoms in their lower limbs and/or lower extremities. We assessed the quality of randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Data were tabulated and presented narratively.

Results

Twenty eligible studies documented SCS treatment in PPN patients, including 10 kHz SCS, traditional low-frequency SCS (t-SCS), dorsal root ganglion stimulation (DRGS), and burst SCS. In total, 451 patients received a permanent implant (10 kHz SCS, n = 267; t-SCS, n = 147; DRGS, n = 25; burst SCS, n = 12). Approximately 88% of implanted patients had painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN). Overall, we found clinically meaningful pain relief (≥ 30%) with all SCS modalities. Among the studies, RCTs supported the use of 10 kHz SCS and t-SCS to treat PDN, with 10 kHz SCS providing a higher reduction in pain (76%) than t-SCS (38–55%). Pain relief with 10 kHz SCS and DRGS in other PPN etiologies ranged from 42–81%. In addition, 66–71% of PDN patients and 38% of nondiabetic PPN patients experienced neurological improvement with 10 kHz SCS.

Conclusion

Our review found clinically meaningful pain relief in PPN patients after SCS treatment. RCT evidence supported the use of 10 kHz SCS and t-SCS in the diabetic neuropathy subpopulation, with more robust pain relief evident with 10 kHz SCS. Outcomes in other PPN etiologies were also promising for 10 kHz SCS. In addition, a majority of PDN patients experienced neurological improvement with 10 kHz SCS, as did a notable subset of nondiabetic PPN patients.

### First evidence of a biomarker-based dose-response relationship in chronic pain using physiological closed-loop spinal cord stimulation [^a5be0112]. Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Spinal cord stimulators represent a significant advancement in the field of pain management. Developed in the 1960s, these implantable devices offer much-needed quality-of-life improvements to countless individuals suffering from chronic neuropathic pain conditions. By delivering electrical impulses to the spinal cord, spinal cord stimulation (SCS) modulates pain signals to provide relief from chronic pain. Despite alleviating pain for many patients, challenges remain when SCS fails to deliver or sustain sufficient pain relief. Traditional open-loop (OL) SCS technology, regardless of waveform (eg, tonic, burst, or high frequency), remains subjectively programmed, with no objective confirmation that the target nerves responsible for pain inhibition are activated consistently. Lack of consistent and adequate therapy may be responsible for loss of efficacy, the primary reason for explants (44%) with conventional OL SCS systems.

The historical absence of ongoing objective measures of therapy delivery in SCS has significantly constrained the potential for improving outcomes. Without real-world, out-of-clinic measures, it is difficult to systematically compare the immediate physiological impacts of different interventions, identify the most effective stimulation parameters, and gauge the impact of therapy on pain relief and functional improvement.

The evoked compound action potential (ECAP) is directly related to the number of dorsal column A-beta (Aβ) fibers activated by a stimulus pulse. The Evoke closed-loop (CL) spinal cord stimulator (Evoke System; Saluda Medical, Macquarie Park, Australia) incorporates physiological closed-loop control (PCLC) technology that measures the ECAP and adapts stimulation levels in real time to adjust for postural and neurological response differences, thereby allowing patients to receive consistent, comfortable therapy. Moreover, the ECAP-based CL system provides comprehensive objective data to optimize therapy and guide clinical practice.

Abstract

BACKGROUND

Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is an effective treatment in chronic neuropathic pain, but its efficacy in complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) needs to be proven.

OBJECTIVE

To study the outcome of SCS in CRPS as measured by trial success, explantation rate, complications, and changes in opioid and neuropathic pain medication use over a 4-yr follow-up.

METHODS

We retrospectively reviewed all medical records of 35 consecutive CRPS patients who underwent SCS trials at 2 hospitals during January 1998 to December 2016. The purchase data of opioids and neuropathic pain medication during January 1995 to March 2016 were retrieved from national registries.

RESULTS

Based on a 1-wk trial, permanent SCS was implanted in 27 (77%) patients. During the median follow-up of 8 yr, 8 (30%) SCS devices were explanted, of which 7 were because of inefficient pain relief. Complications leading to revision occurred in 17 (63%) patients: 8 electrode migrations or stimulation to the wrong area, 1 deep infection, 9 hardware malfunctions, 2 pulse generator discomforts, and 2 SCS replacements. None of the 6 patients using strong opioids discontinued their use during the 2-yr follow-up. The mean opioid dose increased nonsignificantly both in patients with SCS in permanent use (53 ± 150 morphine milligram equivalents morphine milligram equivalent (MME)/day to 120 ± 240 MME/day) and in patients who had SCS explanted (27 ± 72 MME/day to 57 ± 66 MME/day).

CONCLUSION

Despite the fact that CRPS patients were not able to discontinue or reduce their strong opioid or neuropathic pain medication use, 70% continued to use their SCS device during a median 8-yr follow-up.

Neuromodulation

The field of neuromodulation for the treatment of pain has developed rapidly since the seminal paper on the electrical inhibition of pain by the stimulation of the dorsal column almost 50 years ago. The original term of dorsal column stimulation has evolved to become known as spinal cord stimulation (SCS).SCS has been particularly effective as an adjunct in treating mixed neuropathic/nociceptive and neuropathic/radicular pain conditions such as failed back surgery syndrome (FBSS) and complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Neuromodulation therapies offer a treatment option that has minimal side effects and that is relatively safe and potentially reversible.SCS has been used to treat various pain conditions for many decades.–

In traditional SCS therapies, the objective has been to replace the pain sensation with paresthesia that requires mapping of stimulation to the region of pain. The anticipation is that the electrical current alters pain processing by masking the sensation of pain with a comfortable tingling or paresthesia. Although patients mostly cope with paresthesia, a significant proportion report that the sensation is unpleasant, particularly with positional changes.

The stimulation is provided either through electrodes that are placed percutaneously into the epidural space or through a surgical paddle lead that is delivered via a laminotomy. These devices are capable of delivering pulse frequencies in the range of 2–1,200 Hz but are regularly utilized at 40–60 Hz.

Patients typically undergo a trial of neuromodulation with an externalized power source and if this trial proves to be positive and compelling, they subsequently have a subcutaneously implantable pulse generator for the long-term therapy.

In recent years, the next phase in the evolution of neuromodulation has become available with the development of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) SCS and the emerging use of two novel advances in stimulation frequencies, being high-frequency SCS (at 10,000 Hz) and burst SCS.–These recent advances have improved the efficacy and expanded the applicability of SCS.

### Does a screening trial for spinal cord stimulation in patients with chronic pain of neuropathic origin have clinical utility and cost-effectiveness (TRIAL-STIM)? A randomised controlled trial [^a0a8cf26]. Pain (2020). Medium credibility.

4. Discussion

Our results indicate that although an SCS screening trial may have some diagnostic utility, it provides no patient outcome benefits compared to a no screening trial and direct to permanent SCS implantation strategy. Our economic evaluation also shows that an SCS trial is not a cost-effective use of healthcare resources.

Before this study, there was a limited evidence base for the use of SCS screening trials. The success of screening trials (ie, ≥ 50% pain relief) in recent RCTs has ranged from 88%to 93%. However, the proportion of patients reporting ≥ 50% pain relief at 3- or 6-month follow-up ranges only from 48% to 76%. Diagnostic block before radiofrequency denervation can be considered akin to screening trials before SCS implantation and its usefulness has also been questioned. One RCT evaluating diagnostic nerve blocks before proceeding to radiofrequency denervation found that these increased costs and decreased the overall success rate. Another RCT found that the use of prognostic genicular nerve block did not improve the rate of treatment success.

A retrospective study reporting on outcomes after different screening trial strategies observed that a percutaneous temporary lead trial was associated with fewer false positives and wound-related complications as compared to a permanent anchored lead trial. A retrospective review of 80 patients who received SCS after an on-table trial reported that at 12-month follow-up, 40% of the patients no longer required analgesic medication and for 37% of patients, the pain was manageable with first-line analgesics. A post hoc analysis of the PROMISE RCT observed that the only significant contributing factor to infection was trial duration supporting the hypothesis of a cause–effect relationship between trial duration and the risk of infection.

In a study specifically addressing the role of screening trials, Weinand et al. retrospectively reviewed 54 patients with chronic low back pain and/or lower-extremity pain, who underwent acute on-table trial or a prolonged home trial of an average of 5.0 days. Similar to our findings, the study reported that acute (on table) and prolonged SCS screening trials have equivalent predictive value for long-term pain control using SCS.

### Current perspectives on spinal cord stimulation for the treatment of cancer pain [^eed12dc4]. Journal of Pain Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Future Directions

Cancer-related pain represents an important public health problem in terms of the number of patients afflicted and health care costs. Most patients with cancer-related pain are treated with opioid and non-opioid medications as the mainstays of therapy, and yet many medically treated patients continue to report ongoing pain and decreased quality of life. Additionally, adverse effects from pain-related medications represent a considerable challenge for clinicians and patients. Central nervous system and gastrointestinal side effects, in particular, are common and often lead to significant patient morbidity and impaired quality of life.

SCS obtained US Food and Drug Administration approval in 1989, for the treatment of intractable pain of the trunk and/or limbs. Since then, the device hardware, technology, and software contained within the impulse generators have drastically improved and along with that, patient outcomes have improved as well.SCS has been demonstrated in several RCTs totaling over 1000 patients, to provide improved pain control when compared to medical therapy in many challenging chronic neuropathic pain conditions including chronic spine pain persisting after surgery, painful diabetic neuropathy, complex regional pain syndrome, and pain in the setting of peripheral vascular disease. The therapy appears to provide effective pain control across a variety of neuropathic pain conditions and pain-inducing mechanisms. There is an important need to study SCS in cancer-related pain conditions, particularly when considering the shortcomings of the current published literature in this area (including retrospective study designs, small patient numbers, and no inclusion of neurostimulation technological advancements). However, based upon the experience with SCS in the non-cancer pain population and on small series and case reports in cancer pain, it seems highly likely that SCS can be a useful and effective therapy in many of the challenging cancer-related neuropathic pain syndromes such as post radiation neuropathic pain, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathies, and post-surgical pain syndromes.
