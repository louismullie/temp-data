## Question

Management of PE

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the step-by-step management framework for acute pulmonary embolism. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate stabilization and hemodynamic assessment. Then, I should verify the diagnostic pathway and pretest probability tools. Next, I will risk stratify and map treatment to risk category. After that, I need to check anticoagulation choices and duration, including special populations. Then, I will review advanced reperfusion strategies and the role of PERT. Finally, I should confirm outpatient management criteria, follow-up and CTEPH screening, and address controversies like subsegmental PE and thrombophilia testing, making sure I reconcile any guideline differences along the way.

> Let me first confirm the initial priorities: airway, breathing, circulation, and rapid hemodynamic assessment, because high-risk PE with shock or arrest mandates immediate reperfusion consideration and ICU-level care, and I should not delay anticoagulation while arranging advanced therapies if PE probability is high and bleeding risk acceptable [^112u5zuH] [^116e6zPv] [^114prENX].

> Wait, let me verify the diagnostic approach before jumping to treatment decisions. I need to apply validated clinical prediction rules such as Wells or Geneva to estimate pretest probability, then use high-sensitivity D-dimer for low-probability patients and proceed to CT pulmonary angiography for high or intermediate probability, while remembering that D-dimer is less specific in older adults and pregnancy, and that adherence to diagnostic algorithms reduces missed events and improves outcomes [^111sKa8J] [^116x4kmB] [^112kKbjQ] [^114vUUgC].

> Hold on, I should verify risk stratification next, because treatment hinges on it. The ESC 2019 framework classifies PE into high-risk (shock or arrest), intermediate-risk (normotensive with RV dysfunction by imaging or biomarkers, subdivided into intermediate-high and intermediate-low), and low-risk, and I need to integrate clinical scores like sPESI and Hestia to identify candidates for outpatient care, while acknowledging that some guidelines differ in thresholds and tools, which can create variability in practice [^115hu6hH] [^115vwHrh].

> For high-risk PE, I should confirm that systemic thrombolysis is first-line unless contraindicated, with immediate anticoagulation using IV UFH and early consideration of catheter-directed therapy or surgical embolectomy if thrombolysis fails or is contraindicated, ideally via a PERT to coordinate rapid decisions and access to advanced interventions [^115uSEkd] [^116e6zPv] [^114prENX] [^notfound].

> For intermediate-risk PE, let me think about balancing benefit and bleeding. Routine systemic thrombolysis is not recommended. Anticoagulation is foundational, and I should monitor closely for hemodynamic deterioration, with rescue thrombolysis or catheter-directed options if decompensation occurs, recognizing that some guidelines prefer systemic thrombolysis over catheter-directed therapy when thrombolysis is indicated, while others emphasize CDT to mitigate bleeding risk in selected patients [^115D4Jdg] [^116sqyH3] [^112DT7D9] [^111Dkb7b].

> For low-risk PE, I should double-check outpatient eligibility using validated criteria such as Hestia and ensure reliable follow-up and no major comorbidities. DOACs enable home treatment with excellent safety in appropriately selected patients, and I need to remember that despite strong evidence, real-world adoption remains modest, likely due to system and clinician factors [^115vwHrh] [^115m8rFb] [^117GajTd] [^1167VujX].

> Next, I should review anticoagulation choices and dosing. DOACs are preferred for most patients given fixed dosing, no routine lab monitoring, and lower intracranial bleeding risk compared with VKAs. Apixaban and rivaroxaban have specific initiation strategies, and LMWH remains preferred in cancer, pregnancy, and severe renal impairment, with UFH reserved for high-risk presentations or when rapid reversal is needed [^116mwrRU] [^116e6zPv].

> I need to ensure duration decisions are individualized and evidence-based. Minimum treatment is 3 months. Unprovoked PE warrants consideration of indefinite anticoagulation after shared decision-making, whereas provoked PE linked to a transient risk factor can stop at 3 months, with ASH nuances for patients with prior unprovoked VTE or multiple transient events. I should also avoid using thrombophilia testing to guide duration except in narrowly defined scenarios after non-surgical major transient risk factors [^115AT7NP] [^114z8hnr] [^114BcDd9] [^1117voxy] [^1166o5ex].

> Let me consider special populations carefully. In pregnancy, LMWH is standard and DOACs are contraindicated. In cancer, LMWH for at least 3–6 months is favored, with DOACs reasonable in selected patients but avoided in GI, genitourinary, or brain cancers due to bleeding risk. In obesity, standard DOAC dosing is generally used but evidence is limited. In renal impairment, dose-adjust DOACs and prefer LMWH or UFH if CrCl is very low. In antiphospholipid syndrome, VKAs are preferred over DOACs [^116mwrRU] [^117FdfAY].

> I should confirm the role of advanced therapies and PERT. For patients with contraindications to systemic thrombolysis, failure of thrombolysis, or ongoing instability, catheter-directed thrombolysis, mechanical embolectomy, or surgical embolectomy are appropriate in experienced centers, and venoarterial ECMO can be life-saving as a bridge; PERTs operationalize multidisciplinary decision-making and are recommended where available, though outcome data are still maturing [^111AVFF3] [^114pUEP6] [^112LmYVw] [^114BcDd9].

> But wait, what about subsegmental PE without proximal DVT and low recurrence risk? I initially thought all PE required anticoagulation, but I should correct that: CHEST suggests clinical surveillance rather than anticoagulation in carefully selected low-risk subsegmental PE, whereas ESC emphasizes anticoagulation for most confirmed PE. I need to document shared decision-making and ensure close follow-up if surveillance is chosen [^117NM9aJ] [^116woPLH].

> Next, I should review outpatient management safeguards. Patients must meet validated low-risk criteria, have no hypoxemia, no rising troponins or RV strain, adequate social support, and reliable follow-up. Early discharge programs and quality standards support this approach, and I should verify that local protocols align with BTS guidance to minimize risk [^1167VujX] [^111oS9es] [^117GajTd].

> I will now examine follow-up and long-term care. All patients should have structured follow-up at 3–6 months to assess symptoms, bleeding, adherence, and screen for CTEPH if dyspnea persists, using echocardiography and V/Q scanning when indicated. Shared decision-making about indefinite anticoagulation should be revisited annually, and I should avoid routine thrombophilia testing in unprovoked VTE [^1143xtGy] [^116Ffbzt] [^116zNBYV] [^117Nddpd].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about thrombophilia. I should confirm that testing is not routinely indicated for unprovoked VTE or to guide duration, with limited exceptions after non-surgical major transient risk factors; when done, results should be interpreted in clinical context and not used in isolation to determine long-term therapy [^1117voxy] [^1166o5ex] [^117Nddpd].

> Finally, I need to ensure my approach integrates evolving evidence and guideline heterogeneity. The field is moving toward therapy-stratified risk classification and standardized data elements to harmonize care and enable comparative effectiveness research; until then, I should document rationale for deviations, leverage PERT for complex cases, and align with the strongest available guideline consensus while transparently discussing uncertainties with patients [^115ZsUrY] [^111BAqdr] [^115tGrHC].

Management of pulmonary embolism (PE) centers on **rapid risk stratification** and **immediate anticoagulation** for all patients without contraindications [^112u5zuH] [^116e6zPv]. High-risk PE requires **urgent reperfusion** (systemic thrombolysis or surgical/catheter-directed therapy) [^115uSEkd] [^111AVFF3], whereas intermediate-risk PE is managed with close monitoring and **rescue reperfusion** if deterioration occurs [^115D4Jdg] [^116sqyH3]. Low-risk PE can often be treated as an outpatient with **DOACs** [^115m8rFb] [^115vwHrh]. Anticoagulation duration is **3 months minimum**, extended for unprovoked or persistent risk factors, and multidisciplinary PERTs optimize care for complex cases [^115AT7NP] [^114z8hnr] [^114BcDd9].

---

## Risk stratification

Risk stratification guides therapy and disposition; the **ESC 2019 scheme** classifies PE as high, intermediate (intermediate-high or intermediate-low), or low risk based on hemodynamics, RV dysfunction, and biomarkers [^115hu6hH].

| **Risk category** | **Clinical features** | **Management implications** |
|-|-|-|
| High-risk | - Hemodynamic instability (shock or hypotension) | Immediate reperfusion (thrombolysis or embolectomy) [^116wA52s] |
| Intermediate-risk | - Normotensive with RV dysfunction (echo or CT) or elevated biomarkers (BNP, troponin) | - Hospitalization <br/> - Close monitoring <br/> - Rescue reperfusion if deterioration [^116sqyH3] |
| Low-risk | - Hemodynamically stable <br/> - No RV dysfunction or biomarker elevation | Outpatient anticoagulation [^115m8rFb] |

---

## Initial anticoagulation

Anticoagulation should begin **immediately** once PE is suspected or confirmed, unless contraindicated [^112u5zuH].

- **High-risk PE**: IV unfractionated heparin (UFH) for rapid onset and reversibility [^116e6zPv].
- **Intermediate/low-risk PE**: Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) (apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran, edoxaban) [^116K8NYS].
- **Cancer**: LMWH preferred; DOACs may be used with caution [^116mwrRU].

---

## Advanced therapies for high-risk PE

Advanced therapies are indicated for **high-risk PE** or when anticoagulation fails [^115uSEkd] [^116sqyH3].

- **Systemic thrombolysis**: First-line for high-risk PE; tPA is standard [^115uSEkd] [^114prENX].
- **Catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT)**: Lower bleeding risk than systemic thrombolysis; for intermediate-high risk or when systemic thrombolysis is contraindicated [^115QhrmF] [^114pUEP6].
- **Surgical embolectomy**: For failed thrombolysis or contraindications; improving outcomes in specialized centers [^112LmYVw] [^111x9zwN].
- **Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)**: For refractory shock as a bridge to definitive therapy [^112LmYVw] [^113YW3js].

---

## Management of intermediate-risk PE

Intermediate-risk PE requires **careful monitoring** and a low threshold for rescue reperfusion if deterioration occurs [^112zXc2j] [^116sqyH3].

- **Anticoagulation**: Standard therapy; monitor for deterioration [^112u5zuH].
- **Rescue thrombolysis**: If hemodynamic deterioration or worsening RV dysfunction [^116sqyH3].
- **Catheter-directed therapies**: Consider in intermediate-high risk or high bleeding risk [^114vtVGi] [^112aVqbB].

---

## Management of low-risk PE

Low-risk PE is often managed **outpatient** with DOACs, provided reliable follow-up and no contraindications exist [^115m8rFb] [^115vwHrh].

- **Outpatient management**: Safe and effective in selected patients [^115m8rFb] [^115vwHrh].
- **DOACs**: Preferred for convenience and safety [^116mwrRU] [^116K8NYS].
- **Patient education**: Emphasize adherence, bleeding signs, and follow-up [^1116cPiy].

---

## Duration of anticoagulation

Duration is tailored to **provocation status** and recurrence risk [^116zNBYV].

- **Provoked PE**: Minimum 3 months; stop if transient risk factor resolved [^111rJyQH] [^112XoZJD].
- **Unprovoked PE**: Minimum 3 months; consider indefinite anticoagulation after shared decision-making [^114z8hnr] [^115AT7NP].
- **Recurrent VTE**: Indefinite anticoagulation [^notfound].

---

## Special populations and considerations

- **Pregnancy**: LMWH is preferred; DOACs are contraindicated [^notfound].
- **Cancer**: LMWH is preferred; DOACs may be used cautiously [^116mwrRU].
- **Renal impairment**: Adjust DOAC dosing; consider LMWH or UFH [^notfound].
- **Obesity**: Standard dosing generally sufficient; evidence is evolving [^117FdfAY].

---

## Follow-up and long-term management

Structured follow-up is essential to detect complications and guide ongoing care [^116Ffbzt]. Key elements include screening for **chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH)** with echocardiography and pulmonary function tests if dyspnea persists, and reinforcing lifestyle measures such as smoking cessation, weight management, and physical activity [^112agALg]. Multidisciplinary **PERTs** improve coordination and outcomes in complex cases [^114BcDd9].

---

## Emerging therapies and future directions

- **Catheter-based interventions**: Expanding role in intermediate-high risk PE [^1122FFWg] [^111mTWYo].
- **Mechanical circulatory support**: ECMO and RV assist devices for refractory cases [^112LmYVw] [^1164k7pi].
- **Standardized data elements**: Facilitating research and harmonizing care [^111BAqdr].

---

Effective PE management requires **rapid risk stratification**, immediate anticoagulation, and escalation to reperfusion for high-risk cases, with duration individualized and coordinated follow-up to reduce recurrence and complications.

### Current controversies in caring for the critically ill pulmonary embolism patient [^117Kpbs7]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2020). Medium credibility.

Emergency physicians must be prepared to rapidly diagnose and resuscitate patients with pulmonary embolism (PE). Certain aspects of PE resuscitation run counter to typical approaches. A specific understanding of the pathophysiology of PE is required to avoid cardiovascular collapse potentially associated with excessive intravenous fluids and positive pressure ventilation. Once PE is diagnosed, rapid risk stratification should be performed and treatment guided by patient risk class. Although anticoagulation remains the mainstay of PE treatment, emergency physicians also must understand the indications and contraindications for thrombolysis and should be aware of new therapies and models of care that may improve outcomes.

### Controversies in the management of acute pulmonary embolism in the emergency department [^115uZbsh]. The Journal of Emergency Medicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is frequently diagnosed in the Emergency Department (ED), and the management approach can be nuanced.

Objective

In this narrative review, we synthesize the literature in selected areas of ongoing controversy regarding the diagnostic and management approaches for acute PE in the ED, and provide evidence-based recommendations to empower emergency physicians (EPs) to provide optimal care in these situations.

Discussion

d-Dimer is used to clinically exclude the diagnosis of PE patients who are stratified as low risk. However by utilizing likelihood ratio and with certain scoring tools, patient historically considered moderate or high risk for PE may safely be able to have the diagnosis excluded with a negative d-dimer. Traditional risk stratification and management strategies can be cautiously applied to patients with concomitant Coronavirus-19 infection while awaiting more definitive studies. There is an increasing trend in the diagnosis of isolated subsegmental PE, and many patients receiving this diagnosis may be treated without anticoagulation provided that they have no evidence of associated deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and can be closely followed as an outpatient. There is a persistent hesitancy to discharge patients with newly diagnosed acute PE, and existing well-supported risk stratification tools and clinical decision frameworks can support the EP's decision to safely discharge low-risk patients.

Conclusion

tThis review of the literature empowers emergency clinicians to manage challenging PE cases in the ED.

### The PERT concept: a step-by-step approach to managing pulmonary embolism [^114BcDd9]. Chest (2021). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a major source of morbidity and mortality. The presentation of acute PE varies, ranging from few or no symptoms to sudden death. Patient outcome depends on how well the right ventricle can sustain the increased afterload caused by the embolic burden. Careful risk stratification is critical, and the PE response team (PERT) concept offers a rapid and multidisciplinary approach. Anticoagulation is essential unless contraindicated; thrombolysis, surgical embolectomy, and catheter-directed approaches are also available. Clinical consensus statements have been published that offer a guide to PE management, but areas remain for which the evidence is inadequate. Although the management of low-risk and high-risk patients is more straightforward, optimal management of intermediate-risk patients remains controversial. In this document, we offer a case-based approach to PE management, beginning with diagnosis and risk stratification, followed by therapeutic alternatives, and finishing with follow-up care.

### Can selected patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary embolism be safely treated without hospitalization? A systematic review [^112HBLnr]. Annals of Emergency Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Study Objective

Omitting inpatient therapy for emergency department patients with newly diagnosed pulmonary embolism occurs infrequently in the United States. We seek to describe the safety of initial outpatient management of these patients and their demographics, comorbidities, risk stratification, treatment, and outcomes.

Methods

We identified studies from searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and other databases from inception through March 22, 2012. We supplemented this with a search of conference proceedings and consultation with experts. We selected prospective studies of adults with acute, symptomatic, objectively confirmed pulmonary embolism who were discharged home without hospitalization. All contributing studies explicitly defined inclusion and exclusion criteria plus objectively confirmed outcome measures: recurrent thromboembolism, major hemorrhage, and mortality. Two investigators independently identified eligible studies and extracted data. We used the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to assess study quality.

Results

From 2,286 screened titles/abstracts, we selected 8 studies with a total of 777 patients. Seven observational studies were rated low in quality. The one randomized controlled trial was higher in quality, used stricter inclusion criteria, and found that 90-day outcomes for outpatient management were not inferior to inpatient care. Among the 7 studies that reported 90-day outcome measures, the overall incidence of venous thromboembolic-related and hemorrhage-related mortality was very low: 0 of 741 (upper 95% confidence limit 0.62%).

Conclusion

The data on exclusive outpatient management of acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism are limited, but the existing evidence supports the feasibility and safety of this approach in carefully selected low-risk patients.

### Effective risk stratification in pulmonary embolism: evaluating current tools and identifying research gaps [^115hu6hH]. Heart (2025). Medium credibility.

Currently, most international guidelines advocate for risk stratification of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) as a framework to guide treatment decisions. Key prognostic factors for patients with PE include clinical presentation, comorbidities, (imaging) biomarkers and haemodynamic status. The most widely used risk stratification algorithm, outlined in the 2019 European Society of Cardiology/European Respiratory Society guidelines, classifies patients with PE into high-risk (massive), (high or low) intermediate-risk (submassive) and low-risk (nonmassive) categories. It is well established that the risk of adverse outcomes, including mortality, increases with each escalating risk level. However, substantial variation remains among leading international guidelines regarding risk stratification and corresponding treatment recommendations. This inconsistency stems from a lack of grade/level 1A evidence (i.e. strong recommendation based on high-quality evidence) to guide treatment decisions for certain PE risk profiles. In the coming years, ongoing randomised trials comparing novel reperfusion strategies with the current standard of care may reshape risk stratification. If successful, the selection criteria for these studies could lay the foundation for improved risk categories. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of existing risk stratification algorithms and their associated treatment recommendations, identify knowledge gaps and outline future research priorities.

### Management of venous thromboembolism: a clinical practice guideline from the American College of Physicians and the American Academy of Family Physicians [^113tVmRg]. Annals of Family Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Venous thromboembolism is a common condition affecting 7.1 persons per 10,000 person-years among community residents. Incidence rates for venous thromboembolism are higher in men, African-Americans, and increase substantially with age. It is critical to treat deep venous thrombosis at an early stage to avoid development of further complications, such as pulmonary embolism or recurrent deep venous thrombosis. The target audience for this guideline is all clinicians caring for patients who have been given a diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. The target patient population is patients receiving a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism or lower-extremity deep venous thrombosis.

### Pulmonary embolism: care standards in 2018 [^113cidmW]. Progress in Cardiovascular Diseases (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality worldwide. Clinical presentation can be diverse, and clinicians should have a high index of suspicion regarding the diagnosis. Evaluation should include detailed history of possible risk factors, physical examination and laboratory tests that would support the diagnosis and help risk-stratify patients. Finally, a dedicated imaging study should be performed in order to make a definitive diagnosis. Decisions regarding short-term, immediate, treatment are dictated by PE risk category. Treatment of low and high-risk PE is relatively straightforward. But treating moderate risk PE is challenging since aggressive treatment is not devoid of potential harm. This review focuses on the acute and chronic treatment of PE. We present risk stratification, guidance as to treatment choice and insights into chronic treatment with available anticoagulants.

### Interventional therapies for acute pulmonary embolism [^114pUEP6]. The Surgical Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the third leading cause of cardiovascular mortality in the United States. Unfortunately, significant gaps exist in outcome data around many interventional therapies, a fact that is reflected in the low strength of management recommendations found in consensus major society guidelines. In addition to careful risk stratification, therapeutic anticoagulation generally should be an early part of PE management in all cases. For patients presenting with acute high-risk PE or intermediate-risk PE with higher risk features, consideration should be given to systemic thrombolysis after careful evaluation for potential bleeding complications. In patients with contraindications to systemic thrombolysis, failure of this therapy, or significant ongoing cardiopulmonary distress, consideration should be given to interventional therapies like catheter-directed lysis, catheter-directed embolectomy, surgical embolectomy, and mechanical circulatory support. Until more robust comparative outcome data are put forward, pulmonary embolism response teams (PERT) should be considered for multi-disciplinary patient evaluation and management.

Treatment

How long should I anticoagulate for? And with what dose?

Acute VTE/PE events should be treated for a minimum of 3 months. Physicians may consider stopping treatment at 3 months if the risk factor associated with the blood clot is no longer present. However, if the associated risk factor persists beyond 3 months, or if the blood clot occurred with no identifiable risk factors, physicians should consider treatment beyond 3 months, with the possibility of long-term anticoagulation.

Over the past decade, there has been a paradigm shift in anticoagulation management with the majority of patients with acute PE being treated with a DOAC. A step-down dose in certain DOACs (apixaban and rivaroxaban) may be considered from 3 to 6 months after starting anticoagulation. Although patients were treated for a minimum of 6 months in randomised controlled trials of DOACs, in clinical practice, treatment can be reviewed between 3 and 6 months post-VTE.

Specific exceptions to the use of DOACs in acute PE include some patients with cancer such as gastrointestinal tract, renal system or brain malignancies or those receiving systemic cancer therapies with potential drug interactions. It is also recommended against initiating DOACs for the treatment or secondary prophylaxis in patients with venous thrombosis and known APS.

### British thoracic society quality standards for outpatient management of pulmonary embolism [^115F4Gwx]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

The British Thoracic Society (BTS) has been at the forefront of the production of guidelines for best clinical practice in respiratory medicine since the Society was established over 30 years ago. Guideline production methodology has evolved considerably in recent years, and a manual setting out the detailed policy for the production of BTS Guidelines is reviewed annually by the BTS Standards of Care Committee (SOCC). BTS Guidelines received National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) accreditation in 2011. The production of quality standards based on each BTS Guideline is a key part of the range of supporting materials that the Society produces to assist in the dissemination and implementation of a guideline's recommendations. The purpose of the quality standards document is to provide healthcare professionals, commissioners, service providers and patients with a guide to standards of care that should be met for the outpatient management of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) in the UK, together with measurable markers of good practice. BTS Quality Standards are intended for:

Healthcare professionals to allow decisions to be made about care based on the latest evidence and best practice.
People with respiratory disease and their families and carers to enable understanding of what services they should expect from their health and social care provider.
Service providers to be able to quickly and easily examine the clinical performance of their organisation and assess the standards of care they provide.
Commissioners (or equivalent in Scotland and Northern Ireland) so that they can be confident that the services they are purchasing are high quality and cost-effective.

NICE Quality Standards were used as a model for the development of BTS Quality Standards, and the development of these quality standards is based on the NICE Quality Standards Process Guide. This document contains quality standards for the outpatient management of PE. This document was approved by the BTS SOCC in March 2020.

A New Conceptual Model for Risk Stratification

On the basis of these limitations, clinicians and researchers need a novel approach to more effectively assess prognosis and implement precision treatment, because the risks and benefits of treatment options and patient monitoring will vary on the basis of individual patient characteristics. Development of a future risk classification schema that provides individual patient risk assessment and has a link to available therapeutic options and treatment settings will overcome the aforementioned shortcomings (Figure 1). We define this as therapy-stratified risk classification for guiding acute PE management.

Figure 1.
(A) Proposed approach for generating the therapy-stratified risk classification for guiding acute pulmonary embolism (PE) management schema. (B) Limited prognosis-guided risk classification versus proposed therapy-stratified risk classification for guiding acute PE management schemas. CDT = catheter-directed therapies; ESC = European Society of Cardiology; RV = right ventricle; SBP = systolic blood pressure; sPESI = simplified Pulmonary Embolism Severity Index. Thresholds for the therapeutic-guided risk classification used to illustrate the concept, but not proposed for implementation.

Clinicians will use the proposed new approach to risk classification, in conjunction with patient preferences, to determine the appropriate level of care and to prioritize available treatment options. Safety issues, including the risk of bleeding and other procedure-related complications, are also important determinants of the use and choice of therapies. Although all these factors are crucial in decision making for the use and choice of advanced therapies, we do not directly include them in PE-related risk of adverse events.

Therefore, the proposed new model needs to address the following key issues to improve the approach to caring for patients with acute PE:
- For patients with acute PE, which outcomes should prognostic tools assess?

Prognostic tools should predict short-term all-cause mortality, PE-related mortality, hemodynamic collapse, recurrent PE, and major bleeding.

Summary

Despite advances in clinical decision support, the diagnosis, prognostic risk stratification, treatment and disposition of emergency department patients with pulmonary embolism remain challenging. The use of diagnostic risk stratification tools and D‐dimer can decrease unnecessary exposure to radiation and intravenous contrast; however, D‐dimer is elevated in many conditions including normal pregnancy, so imaging is often indicated. Once diagnosed, prognostic risk stratification tools can inform treatment decisions across the risk spectrum, including identifying low‐risk patients with pulmonary embolism who can safely be treated at home. For patients requiring hospitalization, alternatives to unfractionated heparin can improve time to therapeutic anticoagulation and reduce treatment‐related bleeding risk.

Non-thrombotic PE does not represent a distinct clinical syndrome. It may be due to a variety of embolic materials and result in a wide spectrum of clinical presentations, making the diagnosis difficult. With the exception of severe air and fat embolism, the haemodynamic consequences of non-thrombotic emboli are usually mild. Treatment is mostly supportive but may differ according to the type of embolic material and clinical severity.

Despite recent advances in the assessment, risk stratification, and treatment of acute pulmonary embolism (PE), it remains a leading cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in the United States each year. Patient presentation and prognosis are heterogeneous, and a variety of diagnostic and therapeutic instruments have arisen to assist in providing patients with the appropriate level of care and aggressiveness of approach. Fortunately, a growing number of institutions now have pulmonary embolism response teams (PERT) that urgently assist with risk assessment and management of patients with massive and sub-massive PE. In service of providers at the point of contact with acute PE, this review aims to summarize the data pertinent to rapid risk assessment and the interpretation of diagnostics used to that end. The role of PERT and the indications for systemic fibrinolysis and invasive therapies are also discussed.

### Standardized data elements for patients with acute pulmonary embolism: a consensus report from the pulmonary embolism research collaborative [^111BAqdr]. Circulation (2024). Medium credibility.

Recent advances in therapy and the promulgation of multidisciplinary pulmonary embolism teams show great promise to improve management and outcomes of acute pulmonary embolism (PE). However, the absence of randomized evidence and lack of consensus leads to tremendous variations in treatment and compromises the wide implementation of new innovations. Moreover, the changing landscape of health care, where quality, cost, and accountability are increasingly relevant, dictates that a broad spectrum of outcomes of care must be routinely monitored to fully capture the impact of modern PE treatment. We set out to standardize data collection in patients with PE undergoing evaluation and treatment, and thus establish the foundation for an expanding evidence base that will address gaps in evidence and inform future care for acute PE. To do so, > 100 international PE thought leaders convened in Washington, DC, in April 2022 to form the Pulmonary Embolism Research Collaborative. Participants included physician experts, key members of the US Food and Drug Administration, patient representatives, and industry leaders. Recognizing the multidisciplinary nature of PE care, the Pulmonary Embolism Research Collaborative was created with representative experts from stakeholder medical subspecialties, including cardiology, pulmonology, vascular medicine, critical care, hematology, cardiac surgery, emergency medicine, hospital medicine, and pharmacology. A list of critical evidence gaps was composed with a matching comprehensive set of standardized data elements; these data points will provide a foundation for productive research, knowledge enhancement, and advancement of clinical care within the field of acute PE, and contribute to answering urgent unmet needs in PE management. Evidence produced through the Pulmonary Embolism Research Collaborative, as it is applied to data collection, promises to provide crucial knowledge that will ultimately produce a robust evidence base that will lead to standardization and harmonization of PE management and improved outcomes.

### Management dilemmas in acute pulmonary embolism [^113TBBSg]. Thorax (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Physicians treating acute pulmonary embolism (PE) are faced with difficult management decisions while specific guidance from recent guidelines may be absent.

Methods

Fourteen clinical dilemmas were identified by physicians and haematologists with specific interests in acute and chronic PE. Current evidence was reviewed and a practical approach suggested.

Results

Management dilemmas discussed include: sub-massive PE, PE following recent stroke or surgery, thrombolysis dosing and use in cardiac arrest, surgical or catheter-based therapy, failure to respond to initial thrombolysis, PE in pregnancy, right atrial thrombus, role of caval filter insertion, incidental and sub-segmental PE, differentiating acute from chronic PE, early discharge and novel oral anticoagulants.

Conclusion

The suggested approaches are based on a review of the available evidence and guidelines and on our clinical experience. Management in an individual patient requires clinical assessment of risks and benefits and also depends on local availability of therapeutic interventions.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® management of acute pulmonary embolism [^114vtVGi]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a subclass of venous thromboembolism, which can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Risk stratification algorithms classify PE into high-risk (massive), intermediate-risk (submassive), and low-risk groups, with management guidelines determined based on clinical risk. For high-risk PE, first-line treatment options may include anticoagulation, systemic thrombolysis, catheter-directed therapies, and surgical embolectomy. For intermediate-risk PE, management may involve anticoagulation and catheter-directed therapies, whereas for low-risk PE, management typically involves anticoagulation alone. Special case scenarios, such as a clinical contraindication to thrombolysis or right atrial thrombus-in-transit, may require a modified treatment approach. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision process support the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence. The RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method User Manual provides the methodology to determine the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where peer reviewed literature is lacking or equivocal, experts may be the primary evidentiary source available to formulate a recommendation.

### Pulmonary embolism… [^112agALg]. JAMA Network (2013). Excellent credibility.

Customize your JAMA Network experience by selecting one or more topics from the list below. A pulmonary embolism is a blood clot that blocks the blood vessels supplying the lungs. The clot most often comes from the leg veins and travels through the heart to the lungs. When the blood clot lodges in the blood vessels of the lung, it may limit the heart's ability to deliver blood to the lungs, causing shortness of breath and chest pain, and, in serious cases, death. The US surgeon general estimates that 100 000 to 180 000 deaths occur from PE each year in the United States and identifies PE as the most preventable cause of death among hospitalized patients. The January 9, 2013, issue of JAMA contains an article about management of PE. Risk factors Genetic and acquired tendencies to develop blood clots.

Palpitations Dizziness and fainting Leg swelling and discomfort Treatment Anticoagulants are the main treatment for pulmonary embolism and work by preventing new blood clots from forming while the body breaks down the pulmonary embolism. Options for anticoagulation in patients with PE include intravenous heparin and injectable enoxaparin, dalteparin, and fondaparinux. Oral anticoagulants for PE include warfarin and rivaroxaban. Most patients with PE receive at least 6 months of anticoagulation treatment. Many patients are advised to continue anticoagulation treatment for longer than 6 months, sometimes lifelong, if their risk of recurrent PE is high. For some patients with large or massive pulmonary embolism, more aggressive therapy is required.

These treatments include clot-dissolving medications, invasive procedures to remove the embolus with catheters or surgery, and implantation of a filter device to catch free blood clots before they reach the heart. Treating risk factors for pulmonary embolism is a critical step in preventing future blood clots. Lifestyle changes such as regular exercise, a heart-healthy diet, and smoking cessation are important steps in reducing risk.

### Interventional treatment of pulmonary embolism [^116wA52s]. Circulation: Cardiovascular Interventions (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a serious and prevalent cause of vascular disease. Nevertheless, optimal treatment for many phenotypes of PE remains uncertain. Treating PE requires appropriate risk stratification as a first step. For the highest-risk PE, presenting as shock or arrest, emergent systemic thrombolysis or embolectomy is reasonable, while for low-risk PE, anticoagulation alone is often chosen. Normotensive patients with PE but with indicia of right heart dysfunction (by biomarkers or imaging) constitute an intermediate-risk group for whom there is controversy on therapeutic strategy. Some intermediate-risk patients with PE may require urgent stabilization, and ≈10% will decompensate hemodynamically and suffer high mortality, though identifying these specific patients remains challenging. Systemic thrombolysis is a consideration, but its risks of major and intracranial hemorrhages rival overall harms from intermediate PE. Multiple hybrid pharmacomechanical approaches have been devised to capture the benefits of thrombolysis while reducing its risks, but there is limited aggregate clinical experience with such novel interventional strategies. One method to counteract uncertainty and generate a consensus multidisciplinary prognostic and therapeutic plan is through a Pulmonary Embolism Response Team, which combines expertise from interventional cardiology, interventional radiology, cardiac surgery, cardiac imaging, and critical care. Such a team can help determine which intervention-catheter-directed fibrinolysis, ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis, percutaneous mechanical thrombus fragmentation, or percutaneous or surgical embolectomy-is best suited to a particular patient. This article reviews these various modalities and the background for each.

### High and intermediate risk pulmonary embolism in the ICU [^113YW3js]. Intensive Care Medicine (2024). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and important medical emergency, encountered by clinicians across all acute care specialties. PE is a relatively uncommon cause of direct admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), but these patients are at high risk of death. More commonly, patients admitted to ICU develop PE as a complication of an unrelated acute illness. This paper reviews the epidemiology, diagnosis, risk stratification, and particularly the management of PE from a critical care perspective. Issues around prevention, anticoagulation, fibrinolysis, catheter-based techniques, surgical embolectomy, and extracorporeal support are discussed.

### Management guidelines from the American Society of Hematology… [^114BZgG8]. AAFP (2021). Medium credibility.

Key Points for Practice
- In-hospital and home treatment of PE provide similar outcomes, although home treatment of DVT produces better outcomes.
- After primary DOAC treatment for three to six months, decisions for indefinite anticoagulation depend on risk factors associated with initial VTE.
- When VTE is unprovoked or associated with chronic factors, indefinite anticoagulation reduces recurrent VTE with a slightly increased risk of major bleeding. Initial Management of VTE TREATMENT SETTING Treating VTE at home often produces better outcomes than treating in the hospital. In patients with uncomplicated DVT, treating at home reduces the likelihood of PE development. The risk of a subsequent DVT is also less. Mortality and bleeding rates with DVT are similar between treatment settings. For patients with clinically stable PE, home treatment produces outcomes similar to those with hospital treatment.

Systemic, regional, and catheter-directed thrombolysis have similarly elevated bleeding risks. With extensive DVT, the benefits of catheter-directed thrombolysis to prevent PE are uncertain. In patients with PE and hemodynamic compromise demonstrated by systolic blood pressure reduction of at least 40 mm Hg from baseline or systolic blood pressure measurement below 90 mm Hg, the guideline strongly recommends thrombolytic therapy to reduce mortality despite a significant risk of major bleeding that includes intracranial bleeding. In PE with right ventricular dysfunction but no hemodynamic compromise, also called submassive PE, the decision is complicated by poor evidence quality. After VTE that is unprovoked or provoked by a chronic factor, indefinite anticoagulation should be considered.

For unprovoked VTE, indefinite anticoagulation with a DOAC reduces recurrent PE and DVT, although with an increase in major bleeding. Chest. 2016; 150: 988]. Chest. 2016; 149: 315–352.

5 ∣ CONCLUSION

There is an increasing body of evidence supporting outpatient management of low-risk PE. Despite development of multiple validated risk assessment tools and clinical guidelines with clear and concise algorithms, there has been no significant change in rates of early discharge with home-based management of these low-risk PE patients. Developing care pathways and increasing awareness of clinical guideline recommendations may help overcome some of the existing barriers to outpatient management of these patients.

European Heart Journal (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The 2019 European Society of Cardiology guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of acute pulmonary embolism (PE), developed with the European Respiratory Society, provide recommendations on the optimal management of acute PE, including diagnostic algorithms, risk stratification, initial and extended treatment, and follow-up strategy. Some important aspects of the treatment and overall care of patients after acute PE were mentioned, but their detailed discussion was beyond the scope of the guideline document. These issues relate to: management of bleeding risk, screening for cancer, screening for thrombophilia, treatment of PE in women, dealing with sports and travel, detection and management of the post-PE syndrome (PPES), and screening for and management of risk factors for arterial cardiovascular disease. This position paper highlights these key aspects of patient counselling, summarizes best available evidence and provides guidance for clinical practice. It serves as a practical guide to treating patients with acute PE that is intended to be complementary to the formal guideline. The rationale for the conclusions presented is provided in the Supplementary material online, Appendix. This review will not deal with PE and COVID-19, for which the reader is referred to the dedicated European Society of Cardiology (ESC) consensus document.

### British thoracic society guideline for the initial outpatient management of pulmonary embolism [^113xQKTC]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2018). Medium credibility.

Background

The British Thoracic Society (BTS) Guideline for the initial outpatient management of PE provides guidance on how to risk-stratify patients with suspected and confirmed PE and subsequently manage them in an outpatient or ambulatory care setting.

Over the last 10 years there has been an increasing drive to manage many conditions traditionally treated during an inpatient admission as outpatients. This has become widespread practice in managing deep vein thrombosis, and data are increasing to support this strategy in PE. With the licensing of the direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for the treatment of acute PE which do not require a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) run-in or International Normalised Ratio (INR) monitoring, outpatient management of suspected PE has become more straightforward. This is clearly an opportunity to improve patient experience and reduce hospital length of stay, but it also presents a risk if the wrong patients are identified for outpatient management.

Many acute hospital trusts have begun outpatient management of both suspected and confirmed PE, as evidenced by the large number of abstracts presented at conference proceedings, in addition to peer-reviewed publications. However, it is readily apparent from these reports that practice varies, and it is of concern that in some units no validated risk assessment is being undertaken. Given that PE can be fatal, this raises concerns over the safety of some local protocols. This safety concern is further highlighted by the fact that a study of outpatient management of PE was terminated early by the Drug and Safety Monitoring Board after two deaths in the outpatient arm (one right ventricular thrombus and one fatal bleed).

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines on the management of thromboembolic diseases published in 2012 and updated in 2015 provided no recommendations on how to risk-stratify for outpatient management. While both the European Society of Cardiology and the American College of Chest Physicians have also published guidance on the management of acute PE which both support outpatient management, neither provides detailed practical recommendations on risk stratification.

Consider continuing anticoagulant treatment indefinitely in patients with thrombophilia and discontinuing it in patients without thrombophilia.

### Deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism… [^116K8NYS]. AAFP (2017). Low credibility.

Approximately one-third of patients with VTE present with PE, and two-thirds present with DVT. 1 Compared with DVT, PE is more often fatal, has a higher recurrence rate, and is associated with more serious long-term complications. Of patients with proximal DVT, 40% have an associated PE, whereas 70% of patients with PE also have DVT.
3. Similarities in pathogenesis between DVT and PE parallel the similarities in their management, including anticoagulation, risk factor assessment, and perioperative management. For decades, DVT and PE have been treated with unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin and the vitamin K antagonist warfarin. Direct-acting oral anticoagulants are a safe and effective alternative to warfarin that are supported by published guidelines. 4, 5.

Initial Management Prompt diagnosis and treatment of VTE with appropriate medications may prevent thrombus extension and embolization, relieve acute symptoms, prevent cardiopulmonary collapse, and reduce the risk of long-term complications. Empiric treatment during the evaluation period is controversial and not evidence-based. In a hemodynamically unstable patient with a high probability of VTE, intravenous thrombolytic therapy can be considered. 8, 10, 11 Evidence supports outpatient treatment of PE if the risk of nonadherence is low and the patient is clinically stable; has no contraindications to anticoagulation, such as recent bleeding, severe renal or liver disease, or platelet count of less than 70 × 10³ per mm³; and feels capable of managing the disease at home. 8, 10 Patients with PE who are hemodynamically unstable should be admitted to an intensive care unit, and systemic thrombolytic therapy may be considered.
9. 9 Also, when patients with acute PE who are on anticoagulation deteriorate but are not yet hypotensive, systemic thrombolysis is recommended as long as the risk of bleeding is low. 8 There is better evidence for systemic thrombolysis than for catheter-directed thrombolysis. 8 If systemic thrombolysis fails, catheter-directed thrombolysis is available as a rescue therapy in centers with appropriate expertise. Thrombolysis is not indicated in hemodynamically stable patients with intermediate-risk PE. 23.

Conclusion

The suggested approaches are based on a non-systematic review of the guidelines and literature, and expert consensus. Management in an individual patient should be based on clinical risk–benefit assessment, careful management of coagulation status and effective physician–patient communication. Structured follow-up post-acute PE is important to improve patient outcomes, including diagnosing CTEPH. How best to deliver such care and how best to structure follow-up PE clinics requires further evaluation.

Acute pulmonary embolism is the third leading cause of cardiovascular death, with most pulmonary embolism-related mortality associated with acute right ventricular failure. Although there has recently been increased clinical attention to acute pulmonary embolism with the adoption of multidisciplinary pulmonary embolism response teams, mortality of patients with pulmonary embolism who present with hemodynamic compromise remains high when current guideline-directed therapy is followed. Because historical data and practice patterns affect current consensus treatment recommendations, surgical embolectomy has largely been relegated to patients who have contraindications to other treatments or when other treatment modalities fail. Despite a selection bias toward patients with greater illness, a growing body of literature describes the safety and efficacy of the surgical management of acute pulmonary embolism, especially in the hemodynamically compromised population. The purpose of this document is to describe modern techniques, strategies, and outcomes of surgical embolectomy and venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and to suggest strategies to better understand the role of surgery in the management of pulmonary embolisms.

### Management of pulmonary embolism: an update [^112aVqbB]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2016). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) remains a major contributor to global disease burden. Risk-adapted treatment and follow-up contributes to a favorable outcome. Age-adjusted cutoff levels increase D-dimer specificity and may decrease overuse of imaging procedures and overdiagnosis of PE. Primary systemic fibrinolysis has an unfavorable risk-benefit ratio in intermediate-risk PE; catheter-directed techniques are an option for patients with hemodynamic decompensation and high bleeding risk. New oral anticoagulant agents are effective and safe alternatives to standard anticoagulation regimens. Recent trial data do not support insertion of cava filters in patients who can receive anticoagulant treatments. Remaining areas of uncertainty include the therapeutic implications of subsegmental PE, the optimal diagnostic approach to the pregnant patient with suspected PE, and the efficacy and safety of new oral anticoagulant agents in patients with cancer. Campaigns to increase awareness combined with strategies to implement guideline recommendations will be crucial steps towards further optimizing management of acute PE.

### Obesity and acute pulmonary embolism: clinical implications and knowledge gaps [^117FdfAY]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2025). Medium credibility.

Obesity presents unique clinical challenges in the management of acute pulmonary embolism (PE), requiring a tailored approach to both diagnosis and treatment. However, current international guidelines offer limited guidance on specific strategies for managing PE in patients with obesity, often leaving clinicians with uncertainty. The coexistence of obesity and PE complicates diagnostic accuracy due to technical limitations and significantly influences both pharmacologic and interventional treatment decisions. Adding to this complexity is the "obesity paradox", whereby overweight and obese patients may exhibit better survival outcomes than those of normal weight, a phenomenon that complicates the understanding of PE pathophysiology and may contribute to the under-recognition of key risk factors for acute PE. This comprehensive overview offers a comprehensive analysis of the intricate relationship between obesity and PE, emphasizing pathophysiological mechanisms, clinical implications, diagnostic challenges, and evidence-based management approaches.

### Revised paradigm for acute pulmonary embolism prognostication and treatment [^115QhrmF]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2023). Medium credibility.

A certain estimated rate of PE-related serious complications shortly after PE could lead to a recommendation of systemic thrombolytic therapy, assuming that it is the most effective and immediately available treatment and that the estimated risk of bleeding was outweighed by the benefit. The threshold of estimated short-term PE-related serious complication risk to provide catheter-directed therapies might be lower because the percutaneous treatment might have a lower bleeding risk than systemic thrombolysis. A critical review and interpretation of available literature and ongoing RCTs will help reach a consensus for these thresholds.

We propose an approach for producing practical, useful, and consensus risk classification for clinicians and researchers. We will bring together a consensus group that will include representatives of major scientific societies leading the world in promoting and supporting clinical and scientific PE research. We will ensure patient partner participation during the process. To obtain consensus regarding important issues/questions that include but are not limited to those highlighted above, we plan to use a modified Delphi method. At an initial face-to-face meeting, we will discuss a proposed methodology for producing therapy-stratified risk classification for guiding acute PE management recommendations. Through an iterative process, we will develop and rank a list of key issues and questions related to the acute PE therapy. We will use virtual meetings to conduct sequential rounds of addressing the key questions with open discussion of results (Figure 1). We will track the results of major completed and ongoing randomized trials in the field and produce a consensus document regarding therapy-stratified risk classification for guiding acute PE management recommendations. The participants will then produce a manuscript and submit it to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. We also plan on prospectively validating the therapy-stratified risk classification for guiding acute PE management schema in well-designed and adequately powered prospective RCTs.

In conclusion, the approach to risk classification of patients with acute PE needs further study, and we propose a therapy-stratified risk classification for guiding acute PE management. We will produce an expert-guided consensus document that will address many but not all of the shortcomings of the current acute PE risk classification schema and better inform clinical care, research, and health services planning. The proposed therapy-stratified risk classification for guiding acute PE management will then undergo further assessment, refinement, and revision over time.

### International clinical practice guideline Recommendations for acute Pulmonary embolism: harmony, dissonance, and silence [^115ZsUrY]. Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2024). Medium credibility.

Despite abundant clinical innovation and burgeoning scientific investigation, pulmonary embolism (PE) has continued to pose a diagnostic and management challenge worldwide. Aging populations, patients living with a mounting number of chronic medical conditions, particularly cancer, and increasingly prevalent health care disparities herald a growing burden of PE. In the meantime, navigating expanding strategies for immediate and long-term anticoagulation, as well as advanced therapies, including catheter-based interventions for patients with more severe PE, has become progressively daunting. Accordingly, clinicians frequently turn to evidence-based clinical practice guidelines for diagnostic and management recommendations. However, numerous international guidelines, heterogeneity in recommendations, as well as areas of uncertainty or omission may leave the readers and clinicians without a clear management pathway. In this review of international PE guidelines, we highlight key areas of consistency, difference, and lack of recommendations (silence) with an emphasis on critical clinical and research needs.

### Epidemiology, pathophysiology, stratification, and natural history of pulmonary embolism [^113DLqKh]. Techniques in Vascular and Interventional Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common and potentially fatal form of venous thromboembolism that can be challenging to diagnose and manage. PE occurs when there is obstruction of the pulmonary vasculature and is a common cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. A combination of acquired and inherited factors may contribute to the development of this disease and should be considered, since they have implications for both susceptibility to PE and treatment. Patients with suspected PE should be evaluated efficiently to diagnose and administer therapy as soon as possible, but the presentation of PE is variable and nonspecific so diagnosis is challenging. PE can range from small, asymptomatic blood clots to large emboli that can occlude the pulmonary arteries causing sudden cardiovascular collapse and death. Thus, risk stratification is critical to both the prognosis and management of acute PE. In this review, we discuss the epidemiology, risk factors, pathophysiology, and natural history of PE and deep vein thrombosis.

### Contemporary management of acute pulmonary embolism [^1164k7pi]. Seminars in Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery (2020). Medium credibility.

Multiple treatment options beyond anticoagulation exist for massive and submassive pulmonary embolism to reduce mortality. For some patients, systemic thrombolytics and catheter-directed thrombolysis are appropriate interventions. For others, surgical pulmonary embolectomy can be life-saving. Extracorporeal life support and right ventricular assist devices can provide hemodynamic support in challenging cases. We propose a management algorithm for the treatment of massive and submassive pulmonary embolism, in conjunction with a multidisciplinary pulmonary embolism response team, to guide clinicians in individualizing treatment for patients in a timely manner.

### Appropriateness of diagnostic management and outcomes of suspected pulmonary embolism [^114vUUgC]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2006). Low credibility.

Background

International guidelines include several strategies for diagnosing pulmonary embolism with confidence, but little is known about how these guidelines are implemented in routine practice.

Objective

To evaluate the appropriateness of diagnostic management of suspected pulmonary embolism and the relationship between diagnostic criteria and outcome.

Design

Prospective cohort study with a 3-month follow-up.

Setting

116 emergency departments in France and 1 in Belgium.

Patients

1529 consecutive outpatients with suspected pulmonary embolism.

Measurements

Appropriateness of diagnostic criteria according to international guidelines; incidence of thromboembolic events during follow-up.

Results

Diagnostic management was inappropriate in 662 (43%) patients: 36 of 429 (8%) patients with confirmed pulmonary embolism and 626 of 1100 (57%) patients in whom pulmonary embolism was ruled out. Independent risk factors for inappropriate management were age older than 75 years (adjusted odds ratio, 2.27 [95% CI, 1.48 to 3.47]), known heart failure (odds ratio, 1.53 [CI, 1.11 to 2.12]), chronic lung disease (odds ratio, 1.39 [CI, 1.00 to 1.94]), current or recent pregnancy (odds ratio, 5.92 [CI, 1.81 to 19.30]), currently receiving anticoagulant treatment (odds ratio, 4.57 [CI, 2.51 to 8.31]), and the lack of a written diagnostic algorithm and clinical probability scoring in the emergency department (odds ratio, 2.54 [CI, 1.51 to 4.28]). Among patients who did not receive anticoagulant treatment, 44 had a thromboembolic event during follow-up: 5 of 418 (1.2%) patients who received appropriate management and 39 of 506 (7.7%) patients who received inappropriate management (absolute risk difference, 6.5 percentage points [CI, 4.0 to 9.1 percentage points]; P < 0.001). Inappropriateness was independently associated with thromboembolism occurrence (adjusted odds ratio, 4.29 [CI, 1.45 to 12.70]).

Limitations

This was an observational study without evaluation of the risk for overdiagnosis.

Conclusions

Diagnostic management that does not adhere to guidelines is frequent and harmful in patients with suspected pulmonary embolism. Several risk factors for inappropriateness constitute useful findings for subsequent interventions.

### Diagnosis and management of pulmonary embolism [^1171fJ7r]. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America (2022). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is a challenging pathology commonly faced by emergency physicians, and diagnosis and management remain a crucial skill set. Inherent to the challenge is the breadth of presentation, ranging from asymptomatic pulmonary emboli to sudden cardiac death. Diagnosis and exclusion have evolved over time and now use a combination of clinical decision calculators and updates to the classic d-dimer cutoffs. Management of pulmonary emboli revolves around appropriate anticoagulation, which for most of the patients will comprise newer oral agents. However, there remains a substantial degree of practice variation and ambiguity when it comes to higher risk patients with submassive or massive pulmonary emboli.

### Advanced management of intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism [^116PVnae]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism response teams

The complexity of managing patients with intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism calls for a multidisciplinary approach to decision-making as care may have to be individualized on a case-by-case basis. While echocardiography, biomarkers, and risk-stratification strategies help in decision making, it often becomes challenging to predict outcome in patients with intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism. Institutions have developed pulmonary embolism response teams (PERTs) to assist in treatment strategies and the possible need for advanced therapies such as fibrinolysis versus catheter-based treatment versus surgical embolectomy on a case-by-case basis. While the composition of each team varies among institutions, they most often include some variation of pulmonologists, thoracic surgeons, cardiologists, interventional radiologists, and intensivists. It remains to be known whether PERTs improve outcomes, but they offer the best opportunity for a multidisciplinary approach to managing pulmonary embolism. The 2019 ESC guideline recommends forming an interdisciplinary team, such as a PERT, if resources are available. Given the lack of hemodynamic predictors of these patients, we believe that PERTs represent the best method to weigh risk and benefit for each treatment option in patients not only with intermediate-high risk pulmonary embolism but also other pulmonary embolism conundrums.

1 ∣ INTRODUCTION

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the third most common cardiovascular disease after coronary artery disease and stroke. With an incidence between 300 000 and 600 000 in the United States and 39 to 115 per 100 000 individuals in Europe, PE is a global disease accounting for hundreds of thousands of deaths each year. While strongly associated with morbidity and mortality, PE is not always life-threatening. In fact, the majority of PE patients who are hemodynamically stable at presentation have low risk for adverse outcomes. Risk prediction models, such as PE Severity Index (PESI), simplified PESI (sPESI), and Hestia criteria help clinicians stratify patients into appropriate risk groups. One important application of these risk scores is to identify patients in whom outpatient management may be safe. This approach is supported by robust clinical evidence and guideline recommendations from multiple professional organizations and clinical societies.

Indeed, there is a preponderance of evidence from multiple clinical trials to support safe outpatient management of acute PE. A recent Cochrane review of 2 trials found no differences between outpatient management and traditional hospitalization with regard to all-cause mortality at 7 to 10 days or 30 to 90 days as well as no difference in major or minor bleeding. Another systematic review included 12 studies (4 randomized and 8 nonrandomized trials) and showed low rates of all 90-day major adverse outcomes in low-risk PE patients managed at home, including < 1% all-cause mortality, PE-related mortality, recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE), and major bleeding.

Despite these robust safety data, widespread acceptance of risk assessment tools, and the weight of multiple guideline recommendations, adoption of outpatient management has been modest. A number of recent studies indicate that the vast majority of PE patients are still being hospitalized, even when they meet low-risk criteria, and prior efforts to promote outpatient management have produced less change than anticipated. The resulting hospitalizations are estimated to contribute more than $500 million to annual healthcare costs in the United States alone, while exposing patients to risks of hospital adverse events and conflicting with their preference to be treated at home. This is contrast to many other countries where outpatient management of acute PE is quite common.

### Practical guide to management after an acute pulmonary embolism [^1116cPiy]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Abstract

Follow-up after acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is important to assess recovery, consider the need for on-going anticoagulation and identify chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), a rare but serious complication of PE. 16 dilemmas in the follow-up of acute PE were identified by a steering committee of four pulmonologists and a haematologist with interest in PE and/or CTEPH. Current literature was reviewed and a practical approach suggested based on expert consensus. Dilemmas discussed included: (1) how to manage a breathless patient; (2) what to do if CTEPH is suspected; (3) the difference between CTEPH and post-PE syndrome, (4) testing for thrombophilia, (5) when to investigate for cancer, (6) anticoagulation duration and dose, (7) approaches to discussions and decision-making with respect to anticoagulation, (8) use of aspirin and whether antiplatelet therapy should be stopped during anticoagulation and (9) advice for patients on discharge from hospital at 3 months and information for first-degree relatives. Given the occurrence of complications that may require assessment, follow-up of patients post-PE should be systematic and consider the individual needs of the patient.

### Risk adapted management of acute pulmonary embolism in women [^112zXc2j]. Thrombosis Research (2019). Medium credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) represents the third most common cause of cardiovascular death worldwide. Clinical practice guidelines recommend prompt risk stratification of patients with acute PE. Prognostication may accurately identify: 1) hemodynamically unstable (i.e., high-risk) patients with PE, who might benefit from recanalization therapies (i.e., thrombolysis, embolectomy); 2) intermediate- to high-risk patients with PE, who might require monitoring and recanalization procedures if early hemodynamic decompensation occurs; and 3) low-risk patients with PE, who might benefit from an abbreviated hospital stay or outpatient therapy. A fourth group of patients should not undergo escalated or home therapy (intermediate- to low-risk PE). Studies of patients with proven acute PE have shown conflicting data regarding the association between sex and presentation and short-term clinical course in patients with acute symptomatic PE. Therefore, at this time sex differences should not dictate different approaches to prognostication and management.

### Unsolved issues in the treatment of pulmonary embolism [^1166AwNZ]. Thrombosis Research (2001). Low credibility.

The three most controversial and unsolved issues in the treatment of pulmonary embolism (PE) are: (1) the role of thrombolysis, (2) the role of low molecular weight heparin and length of hospital stay, and (3) the optimal duration of anticoagulation. The trend is to use thrombolysis more frequently, to administer low molecular weight heparin and shorten the hospitalization duration in low-risk patients, and to give prolonged courses of anticoagulation with warfarin. PE thrombolysis appears most beneficial in patients at high risk of adverse clinical outcomes in whom the potential hazards of bleeding can be justified by the danger of conservative management with anticoagulation alone. With respect to utilizing low molecular weight heparin as a way of shortening the duration of hospitalization, there are no data to warrant this approach. The current FDA mandate for symptomatic PE patients is to administer intravenous unfractionated heparin administered as a bridge to therapeutic warfarin. Finally, the optimal duration of anticoagulation following acute PE remains mired in controversy. Despite the high rate of recurrent venous thrombosis after discontinuation of anticoagulation, there are currently insufficient data to recommend indefinite warfarin therapy.

Minimally invasive interventional techniques are being utilised more frequently in the management of acute and chronic pulmonary emboli; however, robust clinical evidence is only emerging for the utilisation of these techniques. Hence, there is a need for a robust mechanism of patient selection and careful consideration of the benefits and risks of the interventions. In this review, we discuss the risk stratification mechanisms; the role of the multidisciplinary pulmonary embolism response team to support decision-making; and describe the various commonly used interventional techniques and how these can be integrated into treatment strategies for the benefit of our patients.

### Practical guide to management after an acute pulmonary embolism [^1143xtGy]. BMJ Open Respiratory Research (2025). High credibility.

Introduction

In the UK, over 69 064 hospital episodes of pulmonary embolism (PE) were reported between 2021 and 2022, resulting in 36 757 admissions. Up to 50% of patients with PE will have residual symptoms, with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), a serious but uncommon complication, occurring in approximately 2% of patients. The British Thoracic Society (BTS) guideline recommends that all hospitals should have local protocols and pathways in place for follow-up of all patients with PE and follow-up should be performed by clinicians with a special interest in venous thromboembolism (VTE). The BTS audit of outpatient PE management found that structured follow-up of patients presenting with PE is suboptimal: 87% of UK centres performed follow-up at 3 months, with this occurring in a dedicated PE clinic in 36% of the centres. In addition, a survey of UK physicians found that only 46% of respondents reported that ≥ 75% of patients were offered a 3-month to 6-month follow-up, and a retrospective, single-centre UK study found that 32% of intermediate-high risk and 37% of patients with intermediate-low risk PE were not followed up. To address the gap in practical advice for follow-up of PE, a steering committee of four pulmonologists and a haematologist identified sixteen key questions that they are often asked by physicians assessing patients following an acute PE. Authors conducted a non-systematic literature search for each question and drafted a suggested approach for coauthor review and round-table discussion to achieve consensus.

When there is no clear major transient risk factor, how should I approach a discussion and decision on life-long anticoagulation?

Shared decision-making with the patient is vital to support treatment adherence. Regarding the decision on long-term anticoagulation, physicians should consider the long-term risks of bleeding versus the risk of VTE/PE recurrence and discuss how best to balance these risks with the patient. This balance may change over time, thus an annual review of patients taking long-term anticoagulation should take place. The risk of VTE recurrence following discontinuation of anticoagulation is related to the presence or absence of provoking risk factors at the time of the acute event. Readers should refer to the 2019 ESC guidelines on PE management for the classification of patients into low, intermediate and high risk of life-long VTE recurrence. Patients who have had multiple episodes of VTE in the absence of major transient or reversible risk factors are considered as being at high risk of VTE recurrence, per the 2019 ESC guidelines on PE management, and it is recommended to extend anticoagulation indefinitely in these patients. Cases in which there is no clear provoking risk factor underpinning a patient's first and only episode of VTE are classified as being at intermediate risk of recurrence, and determining the duration of anticoagulation in these patients may be challenging. To inform this decision, several scores for predicting VTE recurrence and bleeding are available to estimate individual patient risk. However, these risk scores should not be used in isolation and cannot be solely relied on.

### JTH in clinic: management of low-risk pulmonary embolism [^117N8Thw]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). Medium credibility.

Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a common cardiovascular disease diagnosis in emergency departments that can be associated with significant morbidity and mortality. One of the first steps after diagnosing PE is to risk stratify for adverse outcomes using risk scores such as PE Severity Index and European Society of Cardiology risk scheme. While intermediate- and high-risk PE patients should be admitted to the hospital, there is increasing evidence to support early discharge and home-based anticoagulation therapy for low-risk patients. The Hestia criteria encompass many of the clinicians' considerations for who may be suitable for early discharge, considering both medical and social factors. Additionally, professional guidelines have provided algorithms on determining which low-risk patients may be suitable. Despite this, low-risk acute PE patients are still often admitted for inpatient treatment. In this review, we present a case-based approach on how to risk stratify and evaluate patients who may be good candidates for early discharge and home therapy.

### Pulmonary embolism: risk assessment and management [^116FgqiE]. European Heart Journal (2012). Low credibility.

Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) poses a significant burden on health and survival. Its severity ranges from asymptomatic, incidentally discovered subsegmental thrombi to massive, pressor-dependent PE complicated by cardiogenic shock and multisystem organ failure. Rapid and accurate risk stratification is therefore of paramount importance to ensure the highest quality of care. This article critically reviews currently available and emerging tools for risk-stratifying acute PE, and particularly for distinguishing between elevated (intermediate) and low risk among normotensive patients. We focus on the potential value of risk assessment strategies for optimizing severity-adjusted management. Apart from reviewing the current evidence on advanced early therapy of acute PE (thrombolysis, surgery, catheter interventions, vena cava filters), we discuss recent advances in oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists, and with new direct inhibitors of factor Xa and thrombin, which may contribute to profound changes in the treatment and secondary prophylaxis of venous thrombo-embolism in the near future.

### Comparison of international guideline recommendations for the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism [^112kKbjQ]. The Lancet: Haematology (2023). High credibility.

Pulmonary embolism is one of the leading causes of death due to cardiovascular disease. Timely diagnosis is crucial, but challenging, as the clinical presentation of pulmonary embolism is unspecific and easily mistaken for other common medical emergencies. Clinical prediction rules and D-dimer measurement allow stratification of patients into groups of expected prevalence and are key elements in adequate selection of patients for diagnostic imaging; however, the strengths and weaknesses of the multiple proposed prediction rules, when to measure D-dimer, and which cutoff to apply might be elusive to a significant proportion of physicians. 13 international guidelines authored by medical societies or expert author groups provide recommendations on facets of the diagnostic investigations in suspected pulmonary embolism, some of which are hallmarked by pronounced heterogeneity. This Review summarises key recommendations of each guideline, considers the most recent evidence on the topic, compares guideline recommendations on each facet of the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, and provides a synthesis on the most common recommendations.

### Treating large pulmonary emboli: do the guidelines guide us? [^111x9zwN]. Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine (2013). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

The diagnosis and management of patients with large pulmonary emboli can be confusing. This review will summarize available data and suggest the areas of certainty and uncertainty in the treatment of these patients.

Recent Findings

Pulmonary emboli can be stratified according to patient prognosis. Risk-stratification of patients with submassive pulmonary emboli is still lacking. Similarly, although the treatment of low-risk pulmonary embolism is well established, and there is consensus regarding systemic thrombolysis for unstable patients with pulmonary embolism, the management of patients with submassive pulmonary embolism is still a matter of debate. The role of novel approaches such as low-dose thrombolysis, catheter-directed therapies and advanced cardiopulmonary support is yet to be determined. Although some patients in skilled centers may benefit from pulmonary embolectomy, patient selection has yet to be refined.

Summary

The treatment of massive and submassive pulmonary embolism has yet to be standardized. The complexity in choosing appropriate treatments for these patients is due to the lack of high-quality data compounded by an expanding arsenal of therapeutic options.
