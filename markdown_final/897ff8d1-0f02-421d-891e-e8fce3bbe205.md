## Question

acamprosate

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about acamprosate for alcohol use disorder. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the drug's identity and mechanism of action. Then, I should verify the FDA-labeled indication and core efficacy data. Next, I will review guideline recommendations and meta-analytic evidence, including any conflicting trials. After that, I need to check dosing, renal adjustments, and safety, and reconcile any apparent contradictions. Finally, I will consider special populations, adherence and real-world effectiveness, and synthesize a practical clinical approach with patient selection and monitoring plans.

> Let me first confirm the drug identity and mechanism. Acamprosate is a synthetic taurine analog that modulates glutamatergic neurotransmission, with proposed actions at NMDA receptor–related sites and metabotropic glutamate receptors, restoring excitatory–inhibitory balance after chronic alcohol exposure; importantly, it is not hepatically metabolized and is renally excreted unchanged, which has clinical implications for dosing and safety in liver disease [^113Er8rB] [^117KskxH].

> I need to verify the labeled indication and timing. The FDA indicates acamprosate for maintenance of abstinence in adults with alcohol dependence who are abstinent at initiation, as part of a comprehensive psychosocial program; efficacy has not been demonstrated in those not detoxified or not abstinent at baseline, and it does not treat acute withdrawal symptoms, so it should be started after withdrawal and continued even if relapse occurs [^115hRyJ1] [^116jUWoC] [^116oufL4].

> Next, I should review the pivotal efficacy data. Three double-blind, placebo-controlled trials totaling 998 detoxified, abstinent patients showed superiority of acamprosate in maintaining continuous abstinence, with study durations ranging from 90 to 360 days; a fourth study that included non-abstinent participants and polysubstance users failed to show benefit, underscoring the importance of abstinence at initiation [^1146jpS3] [^111xvVMN].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should confirm consistency across broader evidence. Multiple meta-analyses corroborate benefit for maintaining abstinence, with Cochrane showing reduced return to drinking and increased cumulative abstinence duration, and contemporary high-quality syntheses estimating a number needed to treat around 11–12 to prevent return to any drinking; however, the COMBINE trial did not find a significant effect for acamprosate, likely reflecting differences in population, adherence, and concomitant behavioral interventions, so I need to contextualize that negative result rather than overgeneralize it [^113CsVhJ] [^115VWcqA] [^114zK4Ko].

> I should double-check guideline positions to ensure alignment. The APA recommends considering acamprosate for moderate-to-severe AUD with abstinence goals, AAFP recommends offering it to prevent return-to-use in currently abstinent patients, and the Canadian CRISM guideline recommends offering it when the treatment goal is abstinence; VA/DoD suggests offering acamprosate among first-line options for moderate–severe AUD, acknowledging variability in trial results and patient preferences [^112Tx3mc] [^113nucNr] [^117JhKsv] [^112rBDYH].

> Let me think about dosing and renal handling, and I should verify the label details. Standard dosing is 666 mg three times daily, ideally started as soon as possible after detoxification; with moderate renal impairment (CrCl 30–50 mL/min), reduce to 333 mg three times daily, and avoid in severe renal impairment (CrCl ≤ 30 mL/min); because acamprosate is renally cleared, elderly patients may have higher exposures and require renal function monitoring [^116jUWoC] [^117KskxH].

> Wait, I initially thought acamprosate might be contraindicated in hepatic impairment, but let me verify that. The FDA labeling indicates no hepatic metabolism and no dose adjustment for mild to moderate hepatic impairment, and hepatology guidelines endorse acamprosate in compensated alcohol-associated liver disease; however, a retrospective signal suggested an association between acamprosate exposure and incident ALD, likely reflecting confounding by indication and severity, so I should counsel on this uncertainty while emphasizing the favorable hepatic safety profile and the need for integrated hepatology–addiction care [^117KskxH] [^115oaSeL] [^113hHgdY] [^112dbb9g].

> I will now examine safety and tolerability. Diarrhea is the most common adverse effect and the primary reason for discontinuation in a minority of patients; psychiatric adverse events including depression and suicidality have been reported, warranting baseline screening and ongoing monitoring, particularly in those with psychiatric comorbidity; overall, discontinuation rates due to adverse events are modest and comparable to placebo in longer trials [^111Vt66g] [^113yDSDu] [^111AreqC].

> Next, I should review special populations and practical modifiers. Acamprosate is a strong option in compensated liver disease and in patients taking opioids, given the lack of hepatic metabolism and no opioid antagonism; in contrast, avoid in severe renal impairment and use reduced dosing with moderate impairment; for patients with adherence challenges, the thrice-daily regimen can be a barrier, so I should consider adherence supports or alternative agents if adherence is unlikely [^115oaSeL] [^116jUWoC] [^114mZAq9].

> Hold on, I should verify real-world effectiveness and adherence issues. Observational data show low and variable prescribing rates in primary care, yet receipt of pharmacotherapy is associated with higher odds of documented abstinence; adherence to three-times-daily dosing is often suboptimal, which may blunt effectiveness, and some real-world cirrhosis cohorts have shown higher readmissions among acamprosate recipients, likely reflecting selection bias toward sicker patients rather than medication harm per se [^11683QFk] [^113WVvkf].

> Let me synthesize a practical clinical approach. Initiate acamprosate after detoxification and once abstinence is achieved, confirm renal function and adjust dose if CrCl is 30–50 mL/min, avoid if CrCl ≤ 30 mL/min, screen for depression and suicidality, and integrate psychosocial treatment; continue through relapse if it occurs, and reassess adherence and tolerability at early follow-up to optimize persistence and outcomes [^116jUWoC] [^115hRyJ1].

> But wait, what if the patient's goal is reduction rather than abstinence, or if adherence to TID dosing is unlikely? In that case, naltrexone may be preferred given stronger evidence for reducing heavy drinking and once-daily dosing, whereas acamprosate's comparative advantage is in maintaining abstinence; shared decision-making should weigh dosing burden, comorbidities, hepatic and renal status, and prior treatment response to tailor the choice [^115VWcqA] [^1111ptfT].

> In conclusion, acamprosate is a first-line, FDA-approved medication for maintaining abstinence in alcohol use disorder when initiated after detoxification in abstinent patients, with robust meta-analytic support, favorable hepatic safety, and manageable tolerability; careful attention to renal function, adherence, and psychiatric comorbidity, along with integration of psychosocial care, are essential to realize its modest but clinically meaningful benefit in routine practice [^115hRyJ1] [^115VWcqA] [^113CsVhJ].

---

Acamprosate is a **first-line medication** [^115VWcqA] for maintaining abstinence in alcohol use disorder, especially after detoxification [^116sZVny], with a favorable safety profile in liver disease [^113hHgdY] and no significant drug interactions [^111AreqC]. It is **less effective for reducing heavy drinking** [^1111ptfT] than naltrexone, and adherence is often limited by thrice-daily dosing and gastrointestinal side effects [^114mZAq9]. Acamprosate is contraindicated in severe renal impairment (CrCl ≤ 30 mL/min) [^116jUWoC] and requires dose reduction in moderate impairment (CrCl 30–50 mL/min) [^116jUWoC]. It is recommended by major guidelines for patients aiming for abstinence, particularly those with hepatic disease or who cannot take naltrexone [^112Tx3mc] [^117JhKsv] [^1137P8t8].

---

## Mechanism of action

Acamprosate is structurally similar to homotaurine and is thought to **modulate glutamatergic neurotransmission** [^113Er8rB], restoring the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters disrupted by chronic alcohol use [^111iFx46]. It may act as a **functional NMDA receptor antagonist** or modulate metabotropic glutamate receptors, thereby reducing neuronal hyperexcitability and craving associated with alcohol withdrawal [^113Er8rB].

---

## Clinical efficacy

Acamprosate has been extensively studied in randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses, demonstrating **modest but significant efficacy** in maintaining abstinence from alcohol:

- **Meta-analyses**: Acamprosate significantly increases continuous abstinence rates and cumulative abstinence duration compared to placebo, with a number needed to treat (NNT) of approximately 9–12 for preventing return to drinking [^113CsVhJ] [^11371CXP] [^115VWcqA].

- **Primary care settings**: Acamprosate is particularly effective in primary care settings for maintaining abstinence in recently detoxified patients, with moderate certainty of evidence supporting its use [^116sZVny] [^112W2q4U].

- **Comparison with naltrexone**: Acamprosate is slightly more effective in promoting abstinence, whereas naltrexone is more effective in reducing heavy drinking and craving. The choice between the two should be guided by patient goals and clinical context [^1111ptfT] [^114knuXM].

---

## Safety and tolerability

Acamprosate is **generally well-tolerated**, with gastrointestinal side effects (particularly diarrhea) being the most commonly reported adverse events [^111Vt66g]. It does not cause hepatotoxicity, making it suitable for patients with liver disease, including those with compensated cirrhosis [^111tZFmm] [^1137P8t8]. However, acamprosate is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤ 30 mL/min) and requires dose adjustment in moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30–50 mL/min) [^111cjJJU] [^116jUWoC].

---

## Patient selection criteria

Acamprosate is **most appropriate** for the following patient populations:

- **Abstinence-oriented patients**: Patients who have achieved abstinence or are committed to abstinence as a treatment goal [^115hRyJ1].

- **Patients with hepatic impairment**: Acamprosate is preferred in patients with liver disease, including compensated cirrhosis, due to its lack of hepatic metabolism [^114mZAq9] [^1137P8t8].

- **Patients intolerant to or contraindicated for naltrexone**: Acamprosate is a suitable alternative for patients who cannot take naltrexone due to contraindications or intolerance [^115FxtMB].

---

## Limitations and challenges

Despite its efficacy, acamprosate faces several **clinical challenges**:

- **Adherence**: Thrice-daily dosing and gastrointestinal side effects (particularly diarrhea) can negatively impact adherence and treatment outcomes [^114mZAq9].

- **Limited efficacy in non-abstinent patients**: Acamprosate is less effective in patients who are not abstinent at initiation or those aiming for reduced consumption rather than abstinence [^115hRyJ1].

- **Geographic variability**: Clinical trials have shown variability in efficacy across different regions, with European studies generally demonstrating greater effectiveness than U.S. studies [^114mZAq9].

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Major clinical guidelines consistently **recommend acamprosate** as a first-line pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder:

| **Guideline** | **Recommendation** |
|-|-|
| American Psychiatric Association (APA) | Recommended first-line treatment for moderate-to-severe AUD, particularly for patients aiming for abstinence [^notfound] |
| American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) | Recommended for patients with alcohol-associated liver disease, including compensated cirrhosis [^1137P8t8] |
| Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense (VA/DoD) | Recommended as a first-line treatment option for moderate-to-severe AUD [^notfound] |

---

## Conclusion

Acamprosate is a **valuable pharmacotherapy** for alcohol use disorder, particularly effective in maintaining abstinence in patients who have achieved abstinence or are committed to abstinence. Its favorable safety profile, especially in patients with hepatic impairment, and lack of significant drug interactions make it a suitable option for many patients. However, adherence challenges and limited efficacy in non-abstinent patients must be considered. Clinicians should tailor treatment choices to patient goals, comorbidities, and preferences to optimize outcomes [^115VWcqA].

### Acamprosate for the adjunctive treatment of alcohol dependence [^111iFx46]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2003). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the literature related to the treatment of alcohol dependence with acamprosate, a synthetic compound structurally similar to the naturally occurring amino acid, homotaurine.

Data Sources

Primary literature and review articles were identified by MEDLINE search (1966-June 2003). Abstracts from recent meetings were also reviewed.

Data Synthesis

Acamprosate has been marketed in 24 countries. Although the precise mechanism of acamprosate in the treatment of alcohol-dependent patients is unclear, it may restore the balance between inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system. European trials have shown consistent increases in abstinence rates compared with placebo when acamprosate use was paired with appropriate psychosocial and behavioral therapies. Decreased direct and indirect healthcare costs associated with acamprosate treatment have also been reported.

Conclusions

Acamprosate is a promising medication for the treatment of alcohol dependence in the US.

### Treatment interventions to maintain abstinence from alcohol in primary care: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116sZVny]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Objective

To determine the most effective interventions in recently detoxified, alcohol dependent patients for implementation in primary care.

Design

Systematic review and network meta-analysis.

Data Sources

Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane CENTRAL, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform.

Study Selection

Randomised controlled trials comparing two or more interventions that could be used in primary care. The population was patients with alcohol dependency diagnosed by standardised clinical tools and who became detoxified within four weeks.

Data Extraction

Outcomes of interest were continuous abstinence from alcohol (effectiveness) and all cause dropouts (as a proxy for acceptability) at least 12 weeks after start of intervention.

Results

64 trials (43 interventions) were included. The median probability of abstinence across placebo arms was 25%. Compared with placebo, the only intervention associated with increased probability of abstinence and moderate certainty evidence was acamprosate (odds ratio 1.86, 95% confidence interval 1.49 to 2.33, corresponding to an absolute probability of 38%). Of the 62 included trials that reported all cause dropouts, interventions associated with a reduced number of dropouts compared with placebo (probability 50%) and moderate certainty of evidence were acamprosate (0.73, 0.62 to 0.86; 42%), naltrexone (0.70, 0.50 to 0.98; 41%), and acamprosate-naltrexone (0.30, 0.13 to 0.67; 17%). Acamprosate was the only intervention associated with moderate confidence in the evidence of effectiveness and acceptability up to 12 months. It is uncertain whether other interventions can help maintain abstinence and reduce dropouts because of low confidence in the evidence.

Conclusions

Evidence is lacking for benefit from interventions that could be implemented in primary care settings for alcohol abstinence, other than for acamprosate. More evidence from high quality randomised controlled trials is needed, as are strategies using combined interventions (combinations of drug interventions or drug and psychosocial interventions) to improve treatment of alcohol dependency in primary care.

### Efficacy of acamprosate for the treatment of alcohol dependence long after recovery from withdrawal syndrome: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted in Japan (sunrise study) [^111pgFcP]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2015). Low credibility.

Objective

To undertake a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to examine the efficacy of acamprosate in maintaining complete abstinence in Japanese patients with alcohol dependence.

Method

We enrolled 327 patients with ICD-10-defined alcohol dependence and randomly assigned them to treatment with either acamprosate (1,998 mg/d orally) or placebo for 24 weeks. The primary endpoint was complete abstinence after 24 weeks of administration. The study was performed at 34 medical institutions between 2009 and 2011.

Results

The acamprosate group demonstrated significantly superior efficacy versus the placebo group on the primary endpoint: the proportion maintaining complete abstinence in the acamprosate group was 47.2% (77/163 subjects), compared with 36.0% (59/164 subjects) in the placebo group (P = 0.039). The difference in complete abstinence rates between the 2 groups was 11.3% (95% CI, 0.6%-21.9%).

Conclusions

Acamprosate is superior to placebo in maintaining abstinence in Japanese patients with alcohol dependence. These findings concur with 11 randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled clinical trials conducted in Europe. This study was designed to reflect clinical practice in Japan and is therefore a meaningful addition to the available evidence in this field.

### Acamprosate for alcohol dependence [^113CsVhJ]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Alcohol dependence is among the main leading health risk factors in most developed and developing countries. Therapeutic success of psychosocial programs for relapse prevention is moderate, but could potentially be increased by an adjuvant treatment with the glutamate antagonist acamprosate.

Objectives

To determine the effectiveness and tolerability of acamprosate in comparison to placebo and other pharmacological agents.

Search Strategy

We searched the Cochrane Drugs and Alcohol Group (CDAG) Specialized Register, PubMed, EMBASE and CINAHL in January 2009 and inquired manufacturers and researchers for unpublished trials.

Selection Criteria

All double-blind randomised controlled trials (RCTs) which compare the effects of acamprosate with placebo or active control on drinking-related outcomes.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently extracted data. Trial quality was assessed by one author and cross-checked by a second author. Individual patient data (IPD) meta-analyses were used to verify the primary effectiveness outcomes.

Main Results

24 RCTs with 6915 participants fulfilled the criteria of inclusion and were included in the review. Compared to placebo, acamprosate was shown to significantly reduce the risk of any drinking RR 0.86 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.91); NNT 9.09 (95% CI 6.66 to 14.28) and to significantly increase the cumulative abstinence duration MD 10.94 (95% CI 5.08 to 16.81), while secondary outcomes (gamma-glutamyltransferase, heavy drinking) did not reach statistical significance. Diarrhea was the only side effect that was more frequently reported under acamprosate than placebo RD 0.11 (95% 0.09 to 0.13); NNTB 9.09 (95% CI 7.69 to 11.11). Effects of industry-sponsored trials RR 0.88 (95% 0.80 to 0.97) did not significantly differ from those of non-profit funded trials RR 0.88 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.96). In addition, the linear regression test did not indicate a significant risk of publication bias (p = 0.861).

Authors' Conclusions

Acamprosate appears to be an effective and safe treatment strategy for supporting continuous abstinence after detoxification in alcohol dependent patients. Even though the sizes of treatment effects appear to be rather moderate in their magnitude, they should be valued against the background of the relapsing nature of alcoholism and the limited therapeutic options currently available for its treatment.

### Treatment interventions to maintain abstinence from alcohol in primary care: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^116bY6Tw]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Discussion

Acamprosate is the only intervention with enough evidence to conclude that it is better than placebo in supporting detoxified, alcohol dependent patients to maintain abstinence for up to 12 months in primary care settings. Weak evidence suggested that acamprosate might be effective in the longer term. It is uncertain whether the other current licensed drugs, naltrexone and disulfiram, improve abstinence in such patients. Although other interventions, such as sodium oxybate, pregabalin, topiramate, and combinations of other interventions, such as acamprosate and naltrexone, acamprosate and nurse visits, and sodium oxybate and naltrexone, may lead to better outcomes than placebo, the low numbers of studies and patients reduced our confidence in the evidence.

Comparison with other reviews

Our findings agree with previous systematic reviews supporting the use of acamprosate in detoxified patients with alcohol dependencyand are in line with recommended guidelines. Previous reviews of interventions to maintain abstinence in alcohol dependent patients have mostly focused on a single specific intervention or group of interventions, and synthesised studies conducted in a variety of populations, which makes them less applicable to clinical practice. A recent systematic review and network meta-analysis, which only included five interventions, exemplifies this problem. In contrast, we included different psychosocial and drug interventions that could be implemented in primary care using network meta-analysis. One studysuggested that disulfiram is effective based on a meta-analysis of different alcohol drinking outcomes and a high heterogeneity of the studies, whereas we found limited evidence to support its effect on abstinence after evaluating studies using rigorous approaches. Of all the drugs studied, disulfiram provides particular challenges in placebo controlled blinded trials because, compared with the other drugs, patients can more easily determine if they are or are not taking disulfiram.

Conclusions and implications

Most interventions identified in this review were not associated with enough evidence to make recommendations in clinical practice, although many are promising and should be investigated in future trials. The findings also provide directions for potential strategies by including additional interventions to complement the treatment effects, such as naltrexone or home visits. These could contribute to a pragmatic trial design. However, the mechanism of acamprosate and other interventions on treating alcohol dependence remains unclear. Establishing the properties of drugs and understanding the psychological needs of alcohol dependent patients or the fundamental causes of alcohol dependency could also inform new strategies for future trial designs.

These findings have important implications for clinical practice, as acamprosate was found to be the only intervention with enough high quality evidence for us to conclude that it is better at maintaining alcohol abstinence than placebo. The finding that there is currently little evidence on other interventions, such as disulfiram, for detoxified, alcohol dependent patients in UK primary care settings should lead to the generation of better evidence from high quality pragmatic randomised trials.

### Alcohol use disorder treatment: the association of pretreatment use and the role of drinking goal [^113C9vTc]. Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Background

In a recent study conducted in a family medicine setting, the medication acamprosate was found not to be efficacious in the treatment of alcohol dependence, but a drinking goal of abstinence was found to have positive effects on alcohol use outcomes. The purpose of this secondary analysis was to further understand which patients with an alcohol use disorder may be most successfully treated in a primary care setting.

Methods

The study was exploratory and used a trajectory-based approach based on data from the acamprosate treatment trial of 100 participants (recruited mostly by advertisement) who were randomly assigned to receive either acamprosate or a matching placebo. Post hoc trajectories of alcohol use before treatment were identified to examine whether trajectory classes and their interactions with treatment arm (acamprosate or placebo), pretreatment drinking goal (abstinence or a reduction), and time predicted alcohol use outcomes.

Results

Three distinct trajectory classes were identified: frequent drinkers, nearly daily drinkers, and consistent daily drinkers. Consistent daily drinkers with a goal of abstinence significantly improved over time on the primary outcome measure of percent days abstinent when compared with frequent and nearly daily drinkers. In addition, all participants with a goal of abstinence, regardless of trajectory class, significantly reduced their percentage of heavy drinking days over time.

Conclusions

Patients with an alcohol use disorder who have a drinking goal of abstinence, in particular consistent daily drinkers, may maximally benefit from alcohol use disorder treatment, including the use of medication, in a primary care setting.

### ACG clinical guideline: alcohol-associated liver disease [^113hHgdY]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

ACG Clinical Guideline — Acamprosate safety and renal considerations — Acamprosate does not undergo hepatic metabolism, and a recent retrospective analysis suggests that its use in patients with cirrhosis is safe; however, a retrospective cohort study revealed that acamprosate use for the treatment of AUD in individuals without a diagnosis of ALD at the start of treatment was associated with the development of ALD (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.84–3.61, P < 0.001). Caution should be taken in patients with concurrent kidney disease, with dose adjustment if the creatinine clearance is between 30 and 50 and avoidance if below 30 mL/min.

### Acamprosate: safety and tolerability in the treatment of alcohol dependence [^113p1DnS]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Acamprosate, in conjunction with psychosocial treatment, has demonstrated efficacy in maintaining abstinence in alcohol-dependent patients in multiple clinical trials. Data from 13 short-term (≤ 26 weeks) and long-term (≥ 48 weeks) clinical trials were analyzed to assess the safety and tolerability of acamprosate: 4234 patients were randomized to placebo (N = 1962), acamprosate 1332 mg/d (N = 440), 1998 mg/d (N = 1749), or 3000 mg/d (N = 83). Overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) was 61% for acamprosate and 56% for placebo (P < 0.01). The majority of AEs in all groups were reported as transient and considered "mild" or "moderate" in severity, and discontinuation rates due to AEs were comparable. Most common AEs were diarrhea (16% acamprosate versus 10% placebo, P < 0.01) and flatulence (3% acamprosate versus 2% placebo, P < 0.01). Patients taking concomitant medications commonly used to treat alcohol dependence reported comparable AEs between placebo- and acamprosate-treated groups. Acamprosate was shown to be safe in patients with hepatic impairment. A dose reduction is recommended in patients with renal impairment. No clinically meaningful between-group differences were reported for clinical chemistry tests or vital sign parameters. This ad hoc analysis demonstrates that acamprosate can be used safely in alcohol-dependent patients, including those taking concomitant medications, or having renal or hepatic impairment.

### Combined pharmacotherapies and behavioral interventions for alcohol dependence: the COMBINE study: a randomized controlled trial [^114zK4Ko]. JAMA (2006). Excellent credibility.

Context

Alcohol dependence treatment may include medications, behavioral therapies, or both. It is unknown how combining these treatments may impact their effectiveness, especially in the context of primary care and other nonspecialty settings.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of medication, behavioral therapies, and their combinations for treatment of alcohol dependence and to evaluate placebo effect on overall outcome.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Randomized controlled trial conducted January 2001-January 2004 among 1383 recently alcohol-abstinent volunteers (median age, 44 years) from 11 US academic sites with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, diagnoses of primary alcohol dependence.

Interventions

Eight groups of patients received medical management with 16 weeks of naltrexone (100 mg/d) or acamprosate (3 g/d), both, and/or both placebos, with or without a combined behavioral intervention (CBI). A ninth group received CBI only (no pills). Patients were also evaluated for up to 1 year after treatment.

Main Outcome Measures

Percent days abstinent from alcohol and time to first heavy drinking day.

Results

All groups showed substantial reduction in drinking. During treatment, patients receiving naltrexone plus medical management (n = 302), CBI plus medical management and placebos (n = 305), or both naltrexone and CBI plus medical management (n = 309) had higher percent days abstinent (80.6, 79.2, and 77.1, respectively) than the 75.1 in those receiving placebos and medical management only (n = 305), a significant naltrexone x behavioral intervention interaction (P = 0.009). Naltrexone also reduced risk of a heavy drinking day (hazard ratio, 0.72; 97.5% CI, 0.53–0.98; p = 0.02) over time, most evident in those receiving medical management but not CBI. Acamprosate showed no significant effect on drinking vs placebo, either by itself or with any combination of naltrexone, CBI, or both. During treatment, those receiving CBI without pills or medical management (n = 157) had lower percent days abstinent (66.6) than those receiving placebo plus medical management alone (n = 153) or placebo plus medical management and CBI (n = 156) (73.8 and 79.8, respectively; P < .001). One year after treatment, these between-group effects were similar but no longer significant.

Conclusions

Patients receiving medical management with naltrexone, CBI, or both fared better on drinking outcomes, whereas acamprosate showed no evidence of efficacy, with or without CBI. No combination produced better efficacy than naltrexone or CBI alone in the presence of medical management. Placebo pills and meeting with a health care professional had a positive effect above that of CBI during treatment. Naltrexone with medical management could be delivered in health care settings, thus serving alcohol-dependent patients who might otherwise not receive treatment.

### An intervention for treating alcohol dependence: relating elements of medical management to patient outcomes with implications for primary care [^114HVv6Z]. Annals of Family Medicine (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose

Alcohol dependence, frequently seen in medical settings, is a major problem that affects the health and well-being of many individuals and their families. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between treatment outcomes and patient and clinician factors specifically associated with a medically oriented intervention given for the treatment of alcohol dependence. The intervention was developed for the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism-sponsored COMBINE Study, a randomized controlled trial combining 2 medications, naltrexone and acamprosate, with Medical Management, with or without specialty alcohol treatment.

Methods

We examined the effect of patient adherence to treatment (number of Medical Management visits, total minutes in treatment, alliance or therapeutic relationship with the clinician, patient satisfaction with treatment, and clinician adherence to the Medical Management protocol) on abstinence from alcohol, amount of heavy drinking, and clinical improvement during treatment.

Results

More Medical Management visits attended and less total time spent in Medical Management treatment was associated with more days of abstinence from alcohol, reductions in heavy alcohol drinking, and a higher likelihood of clinical improvement. The patients' positive perceptions of their alliance with their clinician and their satisfaction with treatment was significantly associated with more days of abstinence from alcohol during treatment. Two clinician factors clinician confidence in the Medical Management treatment and flexibility in delivering Medical Management were also associated with better patient outcomes.

Conclusions

Medically trained clinicians with minimal specialty training in alcohol dependence treatments were able to deliver a brief and effective medication management intervention that was designed to be consistent with primary care practice.

### Treatment of alcohol-dependent outpatients with acamprosate: a clinical review [^1154nHt1]. The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2001). Low credibility.

Acamprosate (calcium acetyl-homotaurine) is a synthetic compound whose chemical structure resembles that of homotaurine, a naturally occurring amino acid. Acamprosate acts centrally and appears to restore the normal activity of glutaminergic neurons, which become hyperexcited as a result of chronic alcohol exposure. Although not yet approved for use in the United States, acamprosate has been available by prescription in France since 1989 and is now available in many other countries throughout the world. This article reviews data from all published double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of acamprosate among alcohol-dependent outpatients. Overall, patients treated with acamprosate exhibited a significantly greater rate of treatment completion, time to first drink, abstinence rate, and/or cumulative abstinence duration than patients treated with placebo. The drug's reliable effect on prolonging abstinence, in conjunction with an excellent safety profile, suggests that acamprosate may be useful for a broad range of patients with alcohol dependence.

### Acamprosate in the treatment of binge eating disorder: a placebo-controlled trial [^116AjU1s]. The International Journal of Eating Disorders (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess preliminarily the effectiveness of acamprosate in binge eating disorder (BED).

Method

In this 10-week, randomized, placebo-controlled, flexible dose trial, 40 outpatients with BED received acamprosate (N = 20) or placebo (N = 20). The primary outcome measure was binge eating episode frequency.

Results

While acamprosate was not associated with a significantly greater rate of reduction in binge eating episode frequency or any other measure in the primary longitudinal analysis, in the endpoint analysis it was associated with statistically significant improvements in binge day frequency and measures of obsessive-compulsiveness of binge eating, food craving, and quality of life. Among completers, weight and BMI decreased slightly in the acamprosate group but increased in the placebo group.

Discussion

Although acamprosate did not separate from placebo on any outcome variable in the longitudinal analysis, results of the endpoint and completer analyses suggest the drug may have some utility in BED.

### Treatment interventions to maintain abstinence from alcohol in primary care: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^1125E2aU]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Strengths and limitations of this review

Our research question and study eligibility criteria were designed to align with current practice to bridge the evidence gap in the care pathway of recently detoxified, alcohol dependent patients in a primary care setting. A main strength of our study is the sensitive search strategies and snowballing technique used to retrieve potentially eligible studies. These were required because the titles, abstracts, and indexes of many studies do not contain keywords or are poorly indexed. We also included all available interventions suitable for primary care to provide an extensive list as a reference for clinical practice.

Our review also has limitations. Firstly, we focused on the maintenance of abstinence. While this is of direct relevance to clinical practice and service planning, it means we excluded studies that investigated the effect of interventions in reducing alcohol consumption in alcohol dependent people who are still drinking (eg, nalmefeneand topiramate) rather than maintaining abstinence. Previous reviews of interventions in abstinent alcohol dependence (ie, post-detoxification) have reported evidence of naltrexonein preventing relapse from a lapse, and for acamprosateor disulfiramin maintaining abstinence in patients with alcohol dependence. These three drugs are recommended by NICEfor clinical effectiveness, and choice is tailored depending on the drinking behaviour and clinical situation of a patient. It remains unclear which method of achieving abstinence is more effective for patients with severe alcohol dependency, detoxification or gradual weaning. A shared decision on the treatment goal should be discussed and made between a patient and a prescriber. Secondly, definitions of detoxification were ambiguous and poorly reported across studies, meaning that we might have included studies when participants were not truly detoxified and missed studies when participants were detoxified but not described as such. Although we tried to contact study authors to confirm whether participants were detoxified in unclear cases, it was often not possible, especially in earlier published studies. Additionally, this (similar to inconsistent reporting in socioeconomic data and characteristics of participants) limited us in the performance of additional analysis in how subsets of particular patients respond to an intervention. Thirdly, the use of all cause dropout as a proxy for acceptability was driven primarily by practical considerations because dropouts often occur in these patients and are well reported across studies. Other outcomes should be taken into account to draw firm conclusions about acceptability of the interventions. Finally, most included studies were conducted in the United States and Europe, which could have implications for applicability to the UK setting. We excluded studies conducted in hospital and intensive rehabilitation settings to give a comprehensive overview of available interventions that could be considered in primary care settings. The translation of evidence into practice still requires thorough evaluation among patients, practitioners, policymakers, and stakeholders, which could be aided using knowledge translation frameworks.

### Does acamprosate improve reduction of drinking as well as aiding abstinence? [^115P2oGz]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2003). Low credibility.

The study aimed to discover whether acamprosate reduces the severity of relapse for those patients undergoing abstinence-orientated treatment who are unable to abstain completely. Data on patients' alcohol consumption from 15 placebo-controlled treatment studies (n = 3309) were examined to test whether, at a given time point, patients who have taken one or more drinks since the last assessment ('relapsers', n = 1010) take alcohol on fewer days, report lower average number of drinks per day, and consume less alcohol in total with acamprosate compared to placebo. These studies had varying duration (90 days, 180 days and 360 days). There were four dates that were common to some studies (days 30, 90, 180 and 360). Among relapsers, acamprosate was significantly associated with less quantity (Q) and frequency (F) of drinking compared to placebo in each of the four follow-up periods (p < 0.001). The differences were most marked for the product Q x F (overall weekly consumption). For each period, there were fewer who were drinking an average of five or more drinks per day in the acamprosate compared to the placebo groups. Acamprosate helps reduce the severity of relapse in patients undergoing abstinence-orientated treatment.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The recommended dose of acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets is two 333 mg tablets (each dose should total 666 mg) taken three times daily. A lower dose may be effective in some patients.

Although dosing may be done without regard to meals, dosing with meals was employed during clinical trials and is suggested in those patients who regularly eat three meals daily.

Treatment with acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets should be initiated as soon as possible after the period of alcohol withdrawal, when the patient has achieved abstinence, and should be maintained if the patient relapses. Acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets should be used as part of a comprehensive psychosocial treatment program.

Recommended dose: 666 mg (two 333 mg tablets) taken three times daily (2).
Dose reduction to one 333 mg tablet taken three times daily for patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30 to 50 mL/min) (2.1).
Acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of ≤ 30 mL/min) (2.1, 4.2, 5.1, 8.6, 12.3).

2.1 Dosage in Renal Impairment

For patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30 to 50 mL/min), a starting dose of one 333 mg tablet taken three times daily is recommended. Acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of ≤ 30 mL/min) [see Contraindications (4.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Meta-analysis of naltrexone and acamprosate for treating alcohol use disorders: when are these medications most helpful? [^1111ptfT]. Addiction (2013). Low credibility.

Aims

Although debates over the efficacy of oral naltrexone and acamprosate in treating alcohol use disorders tend to focus on their global efficacy relative to placebo or their efficacy relative to each other, the underlying reality may be more nuanced. This meta-analysis examined when naltrexone and acamprosate are most helpful by testing: (i) the relative efficacy of each medication given its presumed mechanism of action (reducing heavy drinking versus fostering abstinence) and (ii) whether different ways of implementing each medication (required abstinence before treatment, detoxification before treatment, goal of treatment, length of treatment, dosage) moderate its effects.

Methods

A systematic literature search identified 64 randomized, placebo-controlled, English-language clinical trials completed between 1970 and 2009 focused on acamprosate or naltrexone.

Results

Acamprosate had a significantly larger effect size than naltrexone on the maintenance of abstinence, and naltrexone had a larger effect size than acamprosate on the reduction of heavy drinking and craving. For naltrexone, requiring abstinence before the trial was associated with larger effect sizes for abstinence maintenance and reduced heavy drinking compared with placebo. For acamprosate, detoxification before medication administration was associated with better abstinence outcomes compared with placebo.

Conclusions

In treatment for alcohol use disorders, acamprosate has been found to be slightly more efficacious in promoting abstinence and naltrexone slightly more efficacious in reducing heavy drinking and craving. Detoxification before treatment or a longer period of required abstinence before treatment is associated with larger medication effects for acamprosate and naltrexone respectively.

### Efficacy and safety of naltrexone and acamprosate in the treatment of alcohol dependence: a systematic review [^115k1PA2]. Addiction (2004). Low credibility.

Aims

To ascertain the efficacy and safety of naltrexone and acamprosate in the treatment of alcohol dependence.

Methods

Systematic review of the literature (1990–2002) and meta-analysis of full published randomized and controlled clinical trials assessing acamprosate or naltrexone therapy in alcohol dependence. Estimates of effect were calculated according to the fixed-effects model.

Measurements

Relapse and abstinence rates, cumulative abstinence duration and treatment compliance were considered as primary outcomes. Findings Thirty-three studies met the inclusion criteria. Acamprosate was associated with a significant improvement in abstinence rate [odds ratio (OR): 1.88 (1.57, 2.25), P < 0.001] and days of cumulative abstinence [WMD: 26.55 (17.56, 36.54]. Short-term administration of naltrexone reduced the relapse rate significantly [OR: 0.62 (0.52, 0.75), P < 0.001], but was not associated with a significant modification in the abstinence rate [OR: 1.26 (0.97,1.64), P = 0.08]. There were insufficient data to ascertain naltrexone's efficacy over more prolonged periods. Acamprosate had a good safety pattern and was associated with a significant improvement in treatment compliance [OR: 1.29 (1.13,1.47), P < 0.001]. Naltrexone's side effects were more numerous, yet the drug was nevertheless tolerated acceptably without being associated with a lower adherence to treatment (OR: 0.94 (0.80, 1.1), P = 0.5). However, overall compliance was relatively low with both medications.

Conclusions

Both acamprosate and naltrexone are effective as adjuvant therapies for alcohol dependence in adults. Acamprosate appears to be especially useful in a therapeutic approach targeted at achieving abstinence, whereas naltrexone seems more indicated in programmes geared to controlled consumption. Both drugs are safe and acceptably tolerated but issues of compliance need to be addressed adequately to assure their usefulness in clinical practice.

### The management of substance use disorders: synopsis of the 2021 U.S. department of veterans affairs and U.S. department of defense clinical practice guideline [^114mZAq9]. Annals of Internal Medicine (2022). High credibility.

Acamprosate — alcohol use disorder (AUD) pharmacotherapy: Meta-analyses found acamprosate improved alcohol consumption outcomes relative to placebo, most notably return to drinking after abstinence, and acamprosate may act by normalizing central glutamatergic dysregulation in AUD. Trials have been discordant, with numerous European trials finding effectiveness while some U.S. trials failed to show such benefits, and European studies showing significantly reduced risk of discontinuing treatment whereas trials in the rest of the world demonstrated increased risk of treatment discontinuation associated with acamprosate. The divided dose administration three times daily and large tablet size presents a challenge and can negatively affect adherence; patients who are highly motivated, abstinent before initiation, and not discouraged by the burden of three times-daily dosing are well suited for acamprosate, and acamprosate may be considered for patients also taking prescribed opioids or with significant hepatic damage/impairment since it is not subject to hepatic clearance. Moderate quality evidence of significantly elevated rates of certain adverse events (e.g., anxiety, diarrhea, vomiting) suggests some level of harm, yet the same moderate quality evidence supports significantly reduced return to any drinking and drinking days in outpatient specialty care, with very low to low quality evidence showing no significant between-group differences in return to heavy drinking and heavy drinking days.

### The need for integrating addiction medicine and hepatology [^111tZFmm]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Excessive alcohol use is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity. Among the medical consequences of unhealthy alcohol use, a cardinal one is ALD. Parallel to the increase in alcohol use and AUD, the rates of ALD continue to increase, especially among young people and women. The number of deaths with an underlying cause of ALD increased between 2019 and 2020, from 24 106 to 29 504 (relative change, 22.4%).

The treatment of AUD includes psychosocial and/or pharmacological interventions. Acamprosate, disulfiram, and naltrexone (oral and intramuscular), are approved by the FDA for AUD treatment, and a meta-analysis has found support for the effectiveness of naltrexone and acamprosate in patients with AUD. Furthermore, recent guidelines from the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases highlight and recommend the use of acamprosate in patients with AUD and ALD. This endorsement is consistent with the lack of reported cases of hepatotoxicity in patients who were treated with acamprosate and with the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug given that acamprosate is not metabolized by the liver and is excreted unchanged by the kidneys.

### Developing neuroscience-based treatments for alcohol addiction: a matter of choice? [^114kB6EJ]. Translational Psychiatry (2019). Medium credibility.

The homo-taurine analog acamprosate is approved for the treatment of alcoholism, and its efficacy is supported by meta-analysis. The effect size is however small, and was not reproduced in the largest trial. Both in animal models and in patients, acamprosate influences glutamatergic mechanisms. Animal data suggest that severely dependent individuals, in whom glutamatergic dysregulation is most pronounced, should be most likely to respond to acamprosate. However, the exact molecular mechanism through which acamprosate exerts its effect remains unknown, and it has been suggested that it simply functions as a carrier of calcium-ions into the CNS. This mechanism could help explain its low potency; the recommended daily dose is 2 g. The combination of modest efficacy, a short half-life that necessitates three times daily administration, and a high frequency of gastrointestinal side effects has led to a very limited clinical uptake of acamprosate.

Meta-analytic support for efficacy is also present for some medications that lack approval for the treatment of alcohol addiction, but are approved for other indications. Among these, perhaps the strongest support is available for the anti-epileptic topiramate –. Topiramate has complex molecular mechanisms of action, but because its efficacy appears to be moderated by a polymorphism at the locus encoding the kainate receptor subunit GRIK1, its actions are likely to be mediated through glutamatergic mechanisms. The anti-emetic 5HT3 antagonist ondansetron has support for efficacy in some patient populations –. There are additional approved medications that have some support for their efficacy in alcohol addiction, suggesting that they could be considered for repurposing. These include the nicotinic partial agonist varenicline, that has marketing approval for smoking cessation, and the GABA-B agonist baclofen –, which has long been used for spasticity.

### The efficacy of acamprosate and naltrexone in the treatment of alcohol dependence, Europe versus the rest of the world: a meta-analysis [^113ZzuSj]. Addiction (2015). Low credibility.

Aims

To determine the efficacy of acamprosate and naltrexone in the treatment of those who are alcohol-dependent in reducing lapse/relapse to alcohol consumption and treatment discontinuation, and to examine whether a proportion of the variance in study outcome can be explained by the country in which the trials have taken place.

Method

A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials published before September 2013 was conducted. The primary outcome measures were the efficacy of acamprosate or naltrexone in reducing lapse/relapse compared to placebo in the treatment of alcohol dependence and treatment discontinuation. Twenty-two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the efficacy of acamprosate met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis, with a total of 2649 participants in the acamprosate group and 2587 in the placebo group. Twenty-seven RCTs of the efficacy of naltrexone met inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis, with a total of 2253 participants in the naltrexone group and 1946 in the placebo group. A random-effects model using a Mantel-Haenszel method was applied to conduct the meta-analysis. Variance in study outcomes was explored using subgroup analysis of Europe versus the rest of the world (ROW).

Results

The risk of returning to any drinking at 6 months was significantly lower for acamprosate [risk ratio (RR) = 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.78–0.89]. There was little difference in the risk of participants discontinuing treatment for any reason (RR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.83–1.00) or due to adverse events (RR = 1.30, 95% CI = 0.96–1.75) for the acamprosate compared to placebo groups. The risk of individuals returning to any drinking at approximately 3 months was reduced significantly for the naltrexone group (RR = 0.92, 95% CI = 0.86–1.00), as was the risk of individuals relapsing to heavy drinking at 3 months (RR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.78–0.93). There was no significant difference between naltrexone and placebo for the risk of individuals discontinuing treatment for any reason (RR = 0.94, 95% CI = 0.84–1.05). There was a significantly greater risk of participants in the naltrexone group discontinuing treatment due to adverse events compared to placebo (RR = 1.72, 95% CI = 1.10–2.70). Subgroup analysis by country (Europe versus ROW) revealed no difference in risk between acamprosate and placebo for the outcomes returning to any drinking at 6 months and discontinuing treatment due to adverse events. For the outcome discontinuation of treatment for any reason, there was a significant difference in RR between Europe and the ROW (χ(2) = 11.65, P < 0.001) for acamprosate. Acamprosate was associated with a reduction in risk of discontinuing treatment for Europe (RR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.79–0.95), but an increase in risk of discontinuing treatment for ROW (RR = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.03–1.48).

Conclusions

Both acamprosate and naltrexone appear to reduce the risk of individuals returning to drinking alcohol in those who are alcohol-dependent. The country in which a randomized control trial (RCT) for the efficacy of acamprosate and naltrexone is completed does not appear to explain the variance in trial outcomes for returning to drinking alcohol or discontinuing drinking due to adverse effects. However, the country in which the RCT of acamprosate are completed may be important for explaining the variance between studies for the outcome 'discontinuing treatment for any reason'.

### 2024 guideline for the primary prevention of stroke: a guideline from the American Heart Association / American stroke association [^115psk8F]. Stroke (2024). High credibility.

Substance use interventions — scope and evidence are summarized as follows: Although current evidence cannot directly support interventions addressing substance misuse or substance use disorders for stroke prevention, mitigating their known risks for premature atherosclerosis and untimely death alongside associated stroke risk is reasonable. Screening, Brief Intervention and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) programs show lower prevalence of heavy drinking (43.4%) and illicit drug use (75.8%) at 6 months. Systematic reviews provide moderate evidence supporting brief interventions for harmful drinking whereby multicontact primary care interventions (10–15 minutes) can result in 11% more adults drinking within the recommended limits. In individuals with an alcohol use disorder, evidence supports pharmacotherapies (acamprosate, disulfiram, baclofen, and oral naltrexone) or combined pharmacotherapy and evidence-based behavioral therapy for improving abstinence and heavy drinking, and in noncoerced adults, peer-led treatments and professionally delivered treatments with peer-led involvement can improve rates of continuous abstinence at up to 36 months. Evidence-based agonist treatment strategies for maintenance or suppression of opioid use disorders include buprenorphine and methadone.

### Pharmacotherapy for alcohol use disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115VWcqA]. JAMA (2023). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Alcohol use disorder affects more than 28.3 million people in the United States and is associated with increased rates of morbidity and mortality.

Objective

To compare efficacy and comparative efficacy of therapies for alcohol use disorder.

Data Sources

PubMed, the Cochrane Library, the Cochrane Central Trials Registry, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and EMBASE were searched from November 2012 to September 9, 2022 Literature was subsequently systematically monitored to identify relevant articles up to August 14, 2023, and the PubMed search was updated on August 14, 2023.

Study Selection

For efficacy outcomes, randomized clinical trials of at least 12 weeks' duration were included. For adverse effects, randomized clinical trials and prospective cohort studies that compared drug therapies and reported health outcomes or harms were included.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

Two reviewers evaluated each study, assessed risk of bias, and graded strength of evidence. Meta-analyses used random-effects models. Numbers needed to treat were calculated for medications with at least moderate strength of evidence for benefit.

Main Outcomes and Measures

The primary outcome was alcohol consumption. Secondary outcomes were motor vehicle crashes, injuries, quality of life, function, mortality, and harms.

Results

Data from 118 clinical trials and 20 976 participants were included. The numbers needed to treat to prevent 1 person from returning to any drinking were 11 (95% CI, 1–32) for acamprosate and 18 (95% CI, 4–32) for oral naltrexone at a dose of 50 mg/d. Compared with placebo, oral naltrexone (50 mg/d) was associated with lower rates of return to heavy drinking, with a number needed to treat of 11 (95% CI, 5–41). Injectable naltrexone was associated with fewer drinking days over the 30-day treatment period (weighted mean difference, -4.99 days; 95% CI, -9.49 to -0.49 days) Adverse effects included higher gastrointestinal distress for acamprosate (diarrhea: risk ratio, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.27–1.97) and naltrexone (nausea: risk ratio, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.51–1.98; vomiting: risk ratio, 1.53; 95% CI, 1.23–1.91) compared with placebo.

Conclusions and Relevance

In conjunction with psychosocial interventions, these findings support the use of oral naltrexone at 50 mg/d and acamprosate as first-line pharmacotherapies for alcohol use disorder.

### Incidence and progression of alcohol-associated liver disease after medical therapy for alcohol use disorder [^112dbb9g]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

We found that patients exposed to acamprosate had a higher likelihood of developing ALD. Acamprosate is widely prescribed to patients with AUD and liver disease given its favorable liver safety profile. However, compliance with acamprosate may be lower than with other medical addiction therapy medications because of its complex and frequent dosing regimen. In the present study, although noncompliance with acamprosate may diminish its potential benefit for the patient population, noncompliance alone would not explain its observed association with increased risk for ALD. It is possible that, given the favorable hepatotoxic profile of acamprosate, it is prescribed to patients who are deemed more likely to develop liver disease or have evidence of mild hepatic injury from alcohol. Furthermore, in our practice, acamprosate is reserved for use in patients with more severe AUD. Consistent with this explanation, more patients who received acamprosate had a diagnosis of severe AUD (defined as having both ICD-10 diagnosis codes for conditions termed as alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence), compared with patients who received any other medication for AUD. Although the preponderance of evidence suggests that acamprosate may be beneficial for patients with AUD, a recent study found potential harm. A randomized clinical trial is needed to further elucidate this association between acamprosate and ALD development in well-matched patients with AUD.

In addition, we found that patients with alcohol-associated cirrhosis were less likely to experience a hepatic decompensating event if exposed to medical addiction therapy, even when such treatment was initiated only after their index cirrhosis diagnosis. This result is consistent with findings from previous studies of medical addiction therapy in patients with liver disease. Rogal and colleaguesfound that veterans with cirrhosis who were treated with FDA-approved medical addiction therapy had a 40% reduction in hepatic decompensation at 6 months. Similarly, Mellinger et alfound reduced odds of hepatic decompensation at 1 year in patients with cirrhosis who received FDA-approved medical addiction therapy medications. Naltrexone is currently contraindicated in severe liver diseasegiven the concern for hepatotoxicity and the precipitation of liver failure in these vulnerable patients. The results of this study suggest a benefit of naltrexone: it is a factor in not only preventing ALD but also limiting hepatic decompensation in patients with established cirrhosis. The data that support the risk of hepatotoxicity and liver failure in patients receiving naltrexone are limited. Accordingly, further studies examining the benefits and risks of naltrexone for the treatment of AUD in patients with ALD are needed.

### The physician's unique role in preventing violence: a neglected opportunity? [^116GbvML]. BMC Medicine (2012). Low credibility.

Substance abuse treatment as therapy for aggressive behavior

Alcoholism may be the most common condition associated with violence; alcohol is thought to have a disinhibiting effect on aggressive behavior. Reports suggest that most severe interpersonal violence occurs when the perpetrator is intoxicated. Cocaine abuse is also associated with violence. Not surprisingly, recent research has found that substance abuse treatment can reduce the prevalence of violent behavior by more than half. Patients can be referred to specific substance abuse treatment programs as well as to self-help programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous. Medical management of alcoholism is effective and can include the use of naltrexone or acamprosate. These drugs are relatively underused medications which can reduce the incidence of relapse to alcoholic drinking. Side effects are relatively minor, and in some alcoholics, these drugs can have a marked effect.

### Acamprosate supports abstinence, naltrexone prevents excessive drinking: evidence from a meta-analysis with unreported outcomes [^114knuXM]. Journal of Psychopharmacology (2008). Low credibility.

Two pharmacological agents have repeatedly been shown to be efficacious for relapse prevention in alcohol dependence: The putative glutamate-antagonist acamprosate and the opioid-antagonist naltrexone. Clinical evidence for both drugs is based on various outcome criteria. Whereas for acamprosate primarily abstinence maintenance has been demonstrated, studies with naltrexone have mostly emphasised the prevention of heavy drinking. The remaining effects of both drugs are not always reported; accordingly the corresponding database is fragmentary. Thus, the primary objective of the present meta-analysis was to complete the efficacy profiles for acamprosate and naltrexone and to compare them with each other. Unreported results, requested from the study investigators and the drug manufacturers, were integrated in the computation of effect sizes. For the meta-analysis, emphasis was placed on the conceptual distinction between having a first drink and returning to heavy drinking. Naltrexone was found to have a significant effect on the maintenance of abstinence as well as the prevention of heavy drinking. Acamprosate was shown only to support abstinence; it did not influence alcohol consumption after the first drink. When the efficacy profiles of the two drugs were compared, acamprosate was found to be more effective in preventing a lapse, whereas naltrexone was better in preventing a lapse from becoming a relapse. The superiority of either one drug or over the other one cannot be determined as a general rule, it rather depends on the therapeutic target. Benefits in the treatment of alcohol dependence might be optimized by matching the efficacy profiles of specific antidipsotropics with the motivational status of alcohol-dependent patients.

### Acamprosate calcium enteric-coated (acamprosate calcium) [^111CUaet]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The recommended dose of acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets is two 333 mg tablets (each dose should total 666 mg) taken three times daily. A lower dose may be effective in some patients.

Although dosing may be done without regard to meals, dosing with meals was employed during clinical trials and is suggested in those patients who regularly eat three meals daily.

Treatment with acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets should be initiated as soon as possible after the period of alcohol withdrawal, when the patient has achieved abstinence, and should be maintained if the patient relapses. Acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets should be used as part of a comprehensive psychosocial treatment program.

Recommended dose: 666 mg (two 333 mg tablets) taken three times daily (2).
Dose reduction to one 333 mg tablet taken three times daily for patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance 30–50 mL/min) (2.1).
Acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of ≤ 30 mL/min) (2.1, 4.2, 5.1, 8.6, 12.3).

2.1 Dosage in Renal Impairment

For patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30–50 mL/min), a starting dose of one 333 mg tablet taken three times daily is recommended. Acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of ≤ 30 mL/min) [see Contraindications (4.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), Use in Specific Populations (8.6), and Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)].

### Treatment interventions to maintain abstinence from alcohol in primary care: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113p2JZX]. BMJ (2020). Excellent credibility.

Overview of studies

Supplement 5 shows the characteristics of the 64 included studies. These were published over a period of 35 years (1986–2020). In all but one study, participants started the trial after detoxification; in the remaining study the intervention was started during detoxification. The methods and settings of detoxification were poorly reported (table 1). Most studies stated only that patients were detoxified, without specifying the details. In studies that did report the methods of medically assisted detoxification, patients were commonly detoxified with benzodiazepines, with a third study reporting inpatient detoxification. Despite variation in inclusion and exclusion criteria, the characteristics of participants were similar across studies: predominantly men, aged around 40, and presenting with mild to moderate mental illness, such as anxiety and depression. Only four studies recruited specific populations: people with depressionor sleep disturbance, elderly people, and women. No information was provided on the use of existing drugs or additional drugs in most trials; and if provided, patients were usually not allowed to use or had limited use of additional antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anxiolytics, and hypnotics during the trials.

Table 1
General characteristics of studies. Values are numbers (percentages) unless stated otherwise

Drug interventions were the most studied type of intervention (51/64 studies) (table 1). Six studies investigated seven forms of psychosocial interventions: Addiction‐Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System, cognitive behavioural therapy, short form cognitive behavioural therapy, contingency management, coping skill training, home visit, and motivational enhancement therapy. These interventions were applied either on top of an existing treatment programmeor alone. Two studies specifically investigated combinations of drug and psychosocial interventions: one study compared the effect of combined follow-up by a community nurse and acamprosate with acamprosate alone; another compared the effects of combined treatment with nefazodone and cognitive behavioural therapy. In most studies, patients received concomitant psychosocial therapy or were encouraged to attend self-help interventions, or both, such as Alcoholics Anonymous and social services. However, details of these concomitant interventions, such as settings, methods, and attendance rates, were poorly reported, therefore further analyses of these factors were not possible.

### Acamprosate in alcohol dependence: implications of a unique mechanism of action [^113Er8rB]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2007). Low credibility.

Acamprosate, in combination with psychosocial therapy, has been shown to be clinically effective in maintaining abstinence in alcohol dependence. Current research suggests that its mechanism of action involves functional antagonism of the ionotropic glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. However, direct interactions between acamprosate and the NMDA receptor are weak, and recent findings suggest that acamprosate may modulate NMDA receptors via regulatory polyamine sites, or that it may act directly on metabotropic glutamate receptors. All of these mechanisms are novel for the treatment of alcohol dependence and have far-reaching implications for understanding relapse, as well as for the discovery of drugs with greater efficacy. Understanding the mechanism of action of acamprosate may be an important stimulus for change in the perception and treatment of alcohol dependence.

### Pharmacotherapy for adults with alcohol use disorders in outpatient settings: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^11371CXP]. JAMA (2014). Excellent credibility.

Importance

Alcohol use disorders cause substantial morbidity and early mortality yet remain greatly undertreated. Medications are considerably underused.

Objective

To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the benefits and harms of medications (US FDA-approved and others) for adults with alcohol use disorders.

Data Sources

PubMed, Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, CINAHL, EMBASE, FDA website, and clinical trials registries (January 1, 1970, to March 1, 2014).

Study Selection

Two reviewers selected randomized clinical trials (RCTs) with at least 12 weeks' duration that reported eligible outcomes and head-to-head prospective cohort studies reporting health outcomes or harms.

Data Extraction and Synthesis

We conducted meta-analyses using random-effects models and calculated numbers needed to treat for benefit (NNTs) or harm (NNHs).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Alcohol consumption, motor vehicle crashes, injuries, quality of life, function, mortality, and harms.

Results

We included 122 RCTs and 1 cohort study (total 22,803 participants). Most assessed acamprosate (27 studies, n = 7519), naltrexone (53 studies, n = 9140), or both. The NNT to prevent return to any drinking for acamprosate was 12 (95% CI, 8 to 26; risk difference [RD], -0.09; 95% CI, -0.14 to -0.04) and was 20 (95% CI, 11 to 500; RD, -0.05; 95% CI, -0.10 to -0.002) for oral naltrexone (50 mg/d). The NNT to prevent return to heavy drinking was 12 (95% CI, 8 to 26; RD -0.09; 95% CI, -0.13 to -0.04) for oral naltrexone (50 mg/d). Meta-analyses of trials comparing acamprosate to naltrexone found no statistically significant difference between them for return to any drinking (RD, 0.02; 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.08) or heavy drinking (RD, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.05 to 0.06). For injectable naltrexone, meta-analyses found no association with return to any drinking (RD, -0.04; 95% CI, -0.10 to 0.03) or heavy drinking (RD, -0.01; 95% CI, -0.14 to 0.13) but found an association with reduction in heavy drinking days (weighted mean difference [WMD], -4.6%; 95% CI, -8.5% to -0.56%). Among medications used off-label, moderate evidence supports an association with improvement in some consumption outcomes for nalmefene (heavy drinking days per month: WMD, -2.0; 95% CI, -3.0 to -1.0; drinks per drinking day: WMD, -1.02; 95% CI, -1.77 to -0.28) and topiramate (% heavy drinking days: WMD, -9.0%; 95% CI, -15.3% to -2.7%; drinks per drinking day: WMD, -1.0; 95% CI, -1.6 to -0.48). For naltrexone and nalmefene, NNHs for withdrawal from trials due to adverse events were 48 (95% CI, 30 to 112) and 12 (95% CI, 7 to 50), respectively; risk was not significantly increased for acamprosate or topiramate.

Conclusions and Relevance

Both acamprosate and oral naltrexone were associated with reduction in return to drinking. When directly compared with one another, no significant differences were found between acamprosate and naltrexone for controlling alcohol consumption. Factors such as dosing frequency, potential adverse events, and availability of treatments may guide medication choice.

### Substance misuse in adults: a primary care approach [^116oid2T]. American Family Physician (2024). Medium credibility.

Substance misuse and substance use disorder continue to be major causes of morbidity and mortality, and family physicians are well positioned to provide evidence-based prevention and management for these conditions. Of people 12 years and older, 13% reported using a nonprescribed controlled substance in the past month, and 24% had at least one episode of binge drinking of alcohol, defined as five or more drinks for men and four or more drinks for women on one occasion. Benzodiazepines are used by 12% of the U.S. population. Clinicians should incorporate standardized screening and brief intervention for use of alcohol and other substances into routine care of adult patients, as well as referral to specialized treatment services when indicated. Use of nonstigmatizing, person-first language has been shown to positively affect care for patients with substance use disorders. Alcohol screening and brief intervention have been shown to reduce excessive drinking by 40% in patients at 6 months postintervention. Office-based treatment of alcohol use disorder with medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, such as acamprosate and naltrexone, remains underutilized, presenting another opportunity for family physicians to positively affect the health of their patients and communities. With elimination of the X-waiver, any clinician with Schedule III prescriptive authority can treat opioid use disorder with buprenorphine in their office-based practice. Opioid overdose education and naloxone coprescribing are other tools family physicians can employ to combat the overdose crisis.

### Meta-analyses of placebo-controlled trials of acamprosate for the treatment of alcohol dependence: impact of the combined pharmacotherapies and behavior interventions study [^116RgNLB]. Journal of Addiction Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

Objectives

The Combined Pharmacotherapies and Behavior Interventions Study (COMBINE) reported no significant difference between acamprosate and placebo in the treatment of alcohol dependence. To evaluate the impact of COMBINE, we performed a meta-analysis of acamprosate placebo-controlled trials with the inclusion of data from COMBINE. As a secondary analysis, we added the COMBINE data to a recently published meta-analysis of naltrexone placebo-controlled trials.

Methods

A structured literature search of major databases was performed from January 1990 to August 2007 for acamprosate placebo-controlled randomized trials. Mean differences in cumulative abstinent days (CAD) and abstinence rates (AR) from eligible studies were statistically combined to calculate point estimates and 95% CI for differences in CAD and AR.

Results

Ten and 16 studies evaluating CAD and AR, respectively were suitable for statistical pooling. The findings revealed that acamprosate was superior to placebo in the mean number of CAD (P < 0.001) and AR (pooled AR = 1.58; P < 0.001). The pooled AR for naltrexone was also significant indicating a relative benefit over placebo (AR = 1.27; P < 0.001). The COMBINE trial results contributed a weight of less than 15% to the final pooled statistical outcomes for both agents.

Conclusions

The current study confirmed that acamprosate and naltrexone are both effective agents for the treatment of patients with alcohol dependence. Systematic reviews with meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials and randomized controlled trials with adequate sample sizes are in the same (highest) level of evidence. Therefore, clinicians should use both these sources of information as their foundation for selecting optimal therapy for patients with alcohol dependence.

VA/DoD Clinical Practice Guideline for the Management of Substance Use Disorders — acamprosate versus disulfiram and patient selection notes that despite general consistency in the evidence supporting acamprosate and disulfiram, acamprosate tended to perform better in studies conducted outside of the U.S. than in the U.S. There is some variability in patient preferences regarding acamprosate, with benefits outweighing possible harms, and side effects associated with acamprosate tend to be minimal aside from initial diarrhea or nausea, but patients may be deterred by thrice-daily dosing. Disulfiram and acamprosate are both available as low-cost generics; acamprosate may be preferable in individuals with hepatic disease, while disulfiram may be most appropriate for highly motivated patients seeking sobriety who may be strongly motivated to curtail alcohol use or who are willing to have disulfiram dosing observed by a significant other. As this is a Not reviewed, Amended recommendation, the Work Group considered the assessment of the evidence put forth in the 2015 VA/DoD SUD CPG.

Materials and methods

Discovery study

Subjects and recruitment sites

This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Mayo Clinic Rochester and Mayo Clinic Health System, and was conducted according to the Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki). All participants signed informed consent approved by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Review Board.

Both men and women between the ages of 18 and 80 with a primary diagnosis of current alcohol dependence based on DSM-IV-TR criteria with the last drink 5 or more days before enrollment were included in the study. We excluded subjects unable to provide informed consent; those unable to speak English; those with psychotic disorders or unstable psychiatric or medical conditions (see Supplementary Materials); women who were pregnant, lactating or planning to become pregnant; subjects taking disulfiram; and those allergic to acamprosate.

Participants were recruited from community-based residential and outpatient treatment programs affiliated with Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, and the Mayo Clinic Health System sites in Austin, Minnesota, Albert Lea, Minnesota, and La Crosse, Wisconsin (Supplementary Table S1). In addition, self-referred participants residing in communities adjacent to referral sites not enrolled in treatment programs but interested in taking acamprosate were recruited and included in the analyses as a separate 'study site'. A description of programs and the number of subjects recruited at each site is presented in Supplementary Materials.

Assessment

A detailed description of assessments is presented in Supplementary Table S2 and summarized below. The lifetime presence of alcohol dependence and comorbid disorders was assessed using the semistructured interview PRISM. Time Line Follow-Backwas used to assess alcohol consumption before and during treatment. Craving intensity was assessed using Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS). Association of alcohol use with positive or negative emotional states was assessed using the Inventory of Drug Taking Situations. The intensity of depressive symptoms and anxiety were assessed using a depression scale from the patient health questionnaire, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Assessment. Alcoholic Anonymous attendance monitoringwas used to estimate utilization of support networks.

Treatment outcomes including abstinence (defined as time between initiation of acamprosate treatment and first alcohol use) or alcohol use were assessed with self-report (Timeline Follow-Back) and from available medical records during follow-up visits. Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase measurements were used to assess the accuracy of self-reported sobriety. Compliance with acamprosate was assessed by pill count. The use of other medications was also monitored and considered as potential covariates in the analyses.

Clustered rank of treatments

The mean rank of each treatment was plotted to illustrate clustering of interventions according to higher effectiveness (maintaining abstinence) and higher acceptability (reducing dropout), as well as illustrating the corresponding confidence in the evidence (fig 4). Although many interventions cluster in the lower left hand corner of the figure (indicating higher rank on both outcomes than placebo), the low or very low confidence in the evidence limited the credibility of all interventions except for acamprosate.

Fig 4
Clustered ranking plot by mean rank values from results of network meta-analyses of abstinence and all cause dropouts. Interventions are coloured according to the confidence of evidence by outline (abstinence) and fill (all cause dropout). The interventions in the white zone were ranked better than placebo based on both outcomes. A-CHESS = Addiction-Comprehensive Health Enhancement Support System; ACP = acamprosate; CBT = cognitive behavioural therapy; CIT = citalopram; EST = escitalopram; CST = coping skill training; GHB = sodium salt of gamma hydroxybutyric acid (sodium oxybate); MET = motivational enhancement therapy; NTX = naltrexone; TAU = treatment as usual

Results of additional analysis

Additional network meta-analysis stratified by intervention types did not show significant differences in the relative intervention effects (supplement 8). No evidence was found of heterogeneity being explained by meta-regression on predefined study level characteristics, although this was limited by the number of studies in each intervention and the quality of reporting. Only eight studies (seven interventions) had results for the long term analysis. Acamprosate was the only intervention associated with improved maintenance of abstinence compared with placebo (odds ratio 1.49, 95% confidence interval 0.82 to 2.71), although the evidence is weak.

2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION

The recommended dose of Campral is two 333 mg tablets (each dose should total 666 mg) taken three times daily. A lower dose may be effective in some patients.

Although dosing may be done without regard to meals, dosing with meals was employed during clinical trials and is suggested in those patients who regularly eat three meals daily.

Treatment with Campral should be initiated as soon as possible after the period of alcohol withdrawal, when the patient has achieved abstinence, and should be maintained if the patient relapses. Campral should be used as part of a comprehensive psychosocial treatment program.

### Characterizing the variation of alcohol cessation pharmacotherapy in primary care [^11683QFk]. Journal of General Internal Medicine (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) imposes a high mortality and economic burden. Effective treatment is available, though underutilized.

Objective

Describe trends in AUD pharmacotherapy, variation in prescribing, and associated patient factors.

Design

Retrospective cohort using electronic health records from 2010 to 2019.

Participants

Primary care patients from 39 clinics in Ohio and Florida with diagnostic codes for alcohol dependence or abuse plus social history indicating alcohol use. PCPs in family or internal medicine with at least 20 AUD patients.

Main Measures

Pharmacotherapy for AUD (naltrexone, acamprosate, and disulfiram), abstinence from alcohol, patient demographics, and comorbidities. Generalized linear mixed models were used to identify patient factors associated with prescriptions and the association of pharmacotherapy with abstinence.

Key Results

We identified 13,250 patients; average age was 54 years, 66.9% were male, 75.0% were White, and median household income was $51,776 per year. Over 10 years, the prescription rate rose from 4.4 to 5.6%. Patients who were Black (aOR 0.74; 95% CI 0.58, 0.94) and insured by Medicare versus commercial insurance (aOR 0.61; 95% CI 0.48, 0.78) were less likely to be treated. Higher median household income ($10,000 increment, aOR 1.06; 95% CI 1.03, 1.10) and Medicaid versus commercial insurance (aOR 1.52; 95% CI 1.24, 1.87) were associated with treatment. Receiving pharmacotherapy was associated with subsequent documented abstinence from alcohol (aOR 1.60; 95% CI 1.33, 1.92). We identified 236 PCPs. The average prescription rate was 3.6% (range 0 to 24%). The top decile prescribed to 14.6% of their patients. The bottom 4 deciles had no prescriptions. Family physicians had higher rates of pharmacotherapy than internists (OR 1.50; 95% CI 1.21, 1.85).

Conclusions

Medications for AUD are infrequently prescribed, but there is considerable variation among PCPs. Increasing the use of pharmacotherapy by non-prescribers may increase abstinence from alcohol.

### Combined pharmacotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy for adults with alcohol or substance use disorders: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^112rPLg6]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Sample-Level Descriptive Data

The sample included 30 unique AUD/SUD randomized clinical trials, that examined CBT in combination with some form of pharmacotherapy. The study publication range was 1992 to 2016. The median sample size was 82 participants, with a range of 30to 917. The primary substance targeted in these clinical trials was alcohol (15 [50%]), followed by cocaine (7 [23%]) and opioids (6 [20%]). The sample mean (SD) participant age was 39 (6) years, with a mean (SD) of 28% (12%) female participants. Although reporting of race and ethnicity were inconsistent, the mean (SD) percentages were as follows: 66% (26%) white (21 of 30 studies), 35% (28%) black (15 of 30 studies), and 9% (7%) Latinx (15 of 30 studies). Diagnostically, study inclusion primarily (ie, 95%) targeted individuals with abuse or dependence as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) criteria. The CBT portion of these combined interventions was 73% individual and 26% group delivered, and 1 studyused a mixture of individual and group sessions. The mean number of planned sessions was 16 (range, 4–48), and recruitment contexts were primarily specialty substance use or mental health clinics (20 [68%]), medical settings (5 [16%]), and community advertising (5 [16%]). The following pharmacotherapies were examined in this review: naltrexone hydrochloride and/or acamprosate sodium (26 of 62 effect sizes [42%]), methadone hydrochloride or combined buprenorphine hydrochloride and naltrexone (Suboxone) (11 of 62 [18%]), disulfiram (5 of 62 [8%]), and another pharmacotherapy or a mixture of pharmacotherapies (20 of 62 [32%]) (see Table 1 and Table 2 for details). Study-level risk-of-bias assessment showed 18 studies (60%) were low risk. When studies were designated as unclear or high risk, this was typically owing to (1) the presence of baseline differences between conditions, (2) no report of blinding of personnel and participants, and (3) no report of blinding of outcome assessment. Finally, most studies (21 [70%]) were published in the United States. Of studies conducted outside the United States, the following countries were represented: Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Finland, China, and Australia.

6.1 Clinical Trials Experience

Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reaction rates observed in the clinical trials of a drug cannot be directly compared to rates in the clinical trials of another drug and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.

Clinically significant serious adverse reactions associated with acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets described elsewhere in labeling include suicidality and depression and acute kidney failure [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2), and Adverse Reactions (6.2)].

The adverse event data described below reflect the safety experience in over 7000 patients exposed to acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets for up to one year, including over 2000 acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets-exposed patients who participated in placebo-controlled trials.

Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation

In placebo-controlled trials of 6 months or less, 8% of acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets-treated patients discontinued treatment due to an adverse event, as compared to 6% of patients treated with placebo. In studies longer than 6 months, the discontinuation rate due to adverse events was 7% in both the placebo-treated and the acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets-treated patients. Only diarrhea was associated with the discontinuation of more than 1% of patients (2% of acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets-treated vs. 0.7% of placebo-treated patients). Other events, including nausea, depression, and anxiety, while accounting for discontinuation in less than 1% of patients, were nevertheless more commonly cited in association with discontinuation in acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients.

Common Adverse Events Reported in Controlled Trials

Common adverse events were collected spontaneously in some controlled studies and using a checklist in other studies. The overall profile of adverse events was similar using either method. Table 1 shows those events that occurred in any acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets treatment group at a rate of 3% or greater and greater than the placebo group in controlled clinical trials with spontaneously reported adverse events. The reported frequencies of adverse events represent the proportion of individuals who experienced, at least once, a treatment-emergent adverse event of the type listed, without regard to the causal relationship of the events to the drug.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets are indicated for the maintenance of abstinence from alcohol in patients with alcohol dependence who are abstinent at treatment initiation. Treatment with acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets should be part of a comprehensive management program that includes psychosocial support.

The efficacy of acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets in promoting abstinence has not been demonstrated in subjects who have not undergone detoxification and not achieved alcohol abstinence prior to beginning acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets treatment. The efficacy of acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets in promoting abstinence from alcohol in polysubstance abusers has not been adequately assessed.

Acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets are indicated for the maintenance of abstinence from alcohol in patients with alcohol dependence who are abstinent at treatment initiation (1, 14).

### Acamprosate for the treatment of alcohol dependence [^112irWqj]. Clinical Therapeutics (2005). Low credibility.

Background

Both inpatient and outpatient treatment centers that focus solely on psychosocial therapies for the treatment of alcohol dependence have high relapse rates. Thus, extensive research has focused on the development of pharmacologic moieties to attenuate the craving for alcohol after acute alcohol detoxification. Three drug therapies are currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this purpose: disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate. The latter was approved by the FDA in 2004.

Objective

This article describes the pharmacologic properties and clinical usefulness of acamprosate for the treatment of alcohol dependence.

Methods

Relevant information was identified through searches of MEDLINE (1966 to March 2005), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970–2005), Current Contents (1996–2005), and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (1982-Week 2, 2004) using the key words acamprosate, alcohol dependence, and alcoholism (MeSH).

Results

Acamprosate limited to randomized, controlled clinical trials yielded 33 hits in MEDLINE. Twenty-two articles were reviewed for efficacy end points, and 10 were reviewed for pharmacology and pharmacokinetics data. Acamprosate plus pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics yielded 19 hits, some of which were duplicates from the previously described search. Acamprosate plus meta-analysis (MeSH) yielded 5 hits, naltrexone plus meta-analysis (MeSH) yielded 9 hits, and disulfiram plus meta-analysis yielded 3 hits. The most recent review articles and their reference lists were assessed to ensure completeness of literature searches. Based on these searches, acamprosate is known to be an analogue of taurine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), 2 central nervous system neuromodulators. Acamprosate is thought to share some of the cellular actions of taurine affecting GABA and glutaminergic receptors in the nucleus accumbens, a brain region that may be responsible for the reinforcing effects received after alcohol consumption. Acamprosate is thought to also suppress excitation-induced calcium entry that results from chronic alcohol exposure, thereby altering the conformation of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptors. The percentage of patients taking acamprosate who were completely abstinent throughout the different durations of the studies varied from approximately 18% to 61%, compared with 4% to 45% with placebo. Diarrhea was the most common adverse effect accompanying acamprosate therapy, and this was generally described as dose related and transient.

Conclusions

Acamprosate is associated with modest treatment effects. Its efficacy is similar to naltrexone, and the combination of acamprosate and naltrexone appears to be more efficacious than acamprosate alone, when combined with psychosocial interventions.

10 OVERDOSAGE

In all reported cases of acute overdosage with acamprosate calcium (total reported doses of up to 56 grams of acamprosate calcium), the only symptom that could be reasonably associated with acamprosate calcium was diarrhea. Hypercalcemia has not been reported in cases of acute overdose. A risk of hypercalcemia should be considered in chronic overdosage only. Treatment of overdose should be symptomatic and supportive.

5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS

Dose reduction is required for patients with moderate renal impairment (). 5.1
Monitor patients for depression or suicidal ideation and prompt patients, families, and caregivers to report such symptoms to the health care provider (). 5.2

5.1 Renal Impairment

Treatment with Campral in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30–50 mL/min) requires a dose reduction. Campral is contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of ≤ 30 mL/min) [and]. see Dosage and Administration () 2.1 see Dosage and Administration (), Contraindications (), Use in Specific Populations (), 2.1 4.2 8.6 Clinical Pharmacology () 12.3

5.2 Suicidality and Depression

In controlled clinical trials of Campral, adverse events of a suicidal nature (suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, completed suicides) were infrequent overall, but were more common in Campral-treated patients than in patients treated with placebo (1.4% vs. 0.5% in studies of 6 months or less; 2.4% vs. 0.8% in year-long studies). Completed suicides occurred in 3 of 2272 (0.13%) patients in the pooled acamprosate group from all controlled studies and 2 of 1962 patients (0.10%) in the placebo group. Adverse events coded as "depression" were reported at similar rates in Campral-treated and placebo-treated patients. Although many of these events occurred in the context of alcohol relapse, and the interrelationship between alcohol dependence, depression and suicidality is well-recognized and complex, no consistent pattern of relationship between the clinical course of recovery from alcoholism and the emergence of suicidality was identified. Alcohol-dependent patients, including those patients being treated with Campral, should be monitored for the development of symptoms of depression or suicidal thinking. Families and caregivers of patients being treated with Campral should be alerted to the need to monitor patients for the emergence of symptoms of depression or suicidality, and to report such symptoms to the patient's health care provider.

5.3 Alcohol Withdrawal

Use of Campral does not eliminate or diminish withdrawal symptoms.

Measurement

Our primary outcome measure was the proportion of patients admitted to an internal medicine service with any International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) alcohol-related condition that received either a naltrexone or acamprosate prescription at discharge, excluding patients prescribed naltrexone in an inappropriate or unsafe manner (concurrent opiate at discharge, Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 3 times the upper limit of normal). For our secondary outcome, we measured the rate of emergency room revisit and inpatient readmissions. Data were gathered monthly using the electronic medical record. Baseline data gathering for our project started in June 2019 (hereinafter referred to as month 1). The primary and secondary outcomes were measured monthly and are reported in three distinct time periods: as a baseline (months 1–7), after the first intervention of PDSA cycle 1 (months 8–18) and after the first intervention of our second PDSA cycle (months 19–26). We also tracked how many patients were treated for alcohol withdrawal.

### Real-world analysis of acamprosate use in patients with cirrhosis and alcohol-associated hepatitis [^114Yy4aZ]. BMJ Open Gastroenterology (2024). High credibility.

Objective

Preventing return to alcohol is of critical importance for patients with alcohol-related cirrhosis and/or alcohol-associated hepatitis. Acamprosate is a widely used treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD). We assessed the impact of acamprosate prescription in patients with advanced liver disease on abstinence rates and clinical outcomes.

Methods

This was a retrospective case-control study. We reviewed data on all patients admitted to a large tertiary centre in the UK with alcohol-related cirrhosis and/or alcohol-associated hepatitis. We used propensity risk score matching to match patients prescribed acamprosate to controls. The primary outcome was repeat hospitalisation.

Results

There were 451 patients who met the inclusion criteria of whom 55 patients were started on acamprosate during their admission. Before matching there were significant differences between the cohorts. Patients who received acamprosate were younger (median age 51 vs 57, p < 0.005), more likely to have a purely alcohol-related admission (53% vs 24%, p < 0.001), and more likely to suffer from a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis (42% vs 20%, p < 0.001). On average patients who were started on acamprosate consumed more alcohol (median 155 units/week vs 80 units/week, p < 0.001), were less likely to have a partner (35% vs 54%, p 0.006) and more likely to be unemployed (67% vs 44%, p < 0.001). After matching for factors with significant differences between groups, we generated a cohort of 53 patients prescribed acamprosate and 53 matched controls. At 1 year there was a significantly higher rate of readmission (85% vs 57%, p < 0.001) in the acamprosate group. There were no statistically significant differences in abstinence rates or mortality at 1 year.

Conclusion

Acamprosate prescription was associated with higher rates of readmission in patients with cirrhosis and/or alcohol-associated hepatitis. This may reflect a greater severity of AUD in those patients or might indicate the limited ability of acamprosate to alter the disease course in this population.

14 CLINICAL STUDIES

The efficacy of acamprosate calcium in the maintenance of abstinence was supported by three clinical studies involving a total of 998 patients who were administered at least one dose of acamprosate calcium or placebo as an adjunct to psychosocial therapy. Each study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in alcohol-dependent patients who had undergone inpatient detoxification and were abstinent from alcohol on the day of randomization. Study durations ranged from 90 days to 360 days. Acamprosate calcium proved superior to placebo in maintaining abstinence, as indicated by a greater percentage of subjects being assessed as continuously abstinent throughout treatment.

In a fourth study, the efficacy of acamprosate calcium was evaluated in alcoholics, including patients with a history of polysubstance abuse and patients who had not undergone detoxification and were not required to be abstinent at baseline. This study failed to demonstrate superiority of acamprosate calcium over placebo.

Elimination

After oral dosing of 2 x 333 mg of acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets, the terminal half-life ranges from approximately 20–33 hours. Following oral administration of acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets, the major route of excretion is via the kidneys as acamprosate.

Special Populations

Gender

Acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets do not exhibit any significant pharmacokinetic differences between male and female subjects.

Age

The pharmacokinetics of acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets have not been evaluated in a geriatric population. However, since renal function diminishes in elderly patients and acamprosate is excreted unchanged in urine, acamprosate plasma concentrations are likely to be higher in the elderly population compared to younger adults.

Pediatrics

The pharmacokinetics of acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets have not been evaluated in a pediatric population.

Renal Impairment

Peak plasma concentrations after administration of a single dose of 2 x 333 mg acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets to patients with moderate or severe renal impairment were about 2-fold and 4-fold higher, respectively, compared to healthy subjects. Similarly, elimination half-life was about 1.8-fold and 2.6-fold longer, respectively, compared to healthy subjects. There is a linear relationship between creatinine clearance values and total apparent plasma clearance, renal clearance and plasma half-life of acamprosate. A dose of 1 x 333 mg acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets, three times daily, is recommended in patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 30–50 mL/min, [see Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets are contraindicated in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance of ≤ 30 mL/min) [see Dosage and Administration (2.1), Contraindications (4.2), Warnings and Precautions (5.1), and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)].

Hepatic Impairment

Acamprosate is not metabolized by the liver and the pharmacokinetics of acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets are not altered in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (groups A and B of the Child-Pugh classification). No adjustment of dosage is recommended in such patients.

Alcohol-Dependent Subjects

A cross-study comparison of acamprosate calcium delayed-release tablets at doses of 2 x 333 mg three times daily indicated similar pharmacokinetics between alcohol-dependent subjects and healthy subjects.

### Genetic markers associated with abstinence length in alcohol-dependent subjects treated with acamprosate [^1139eDLA]. Translational Psychiatry (2014). Low credibility.

We identified genetic markers associated with the length of sobriety during acamprosate treatment. This is an important step toward the development of personalized treatment recommendations for patients with alcohol use disorders, as genetic markers may be used for selection of patients who have the highest probability of responding to acamprosate treatment. We think that with the limited number of antidipsotropic medications and lack of uniformity in treatment response, the development of such recommendations is of special importance for improvement of treatment outcomes in patients with alcohol use disorders.

Concomitant Therapies

In clinical trials, the safety profile in subjects treated with acamprosate calcium concomitantly with anxiolytics, hypnotics and sedatives (including benzodiazepines), or non-opioid analgesics was similar to that of subjects taking placebo with these concomitant medications. Patients taking acamprosate calcium concomitantly with antidepressants more commonly reported both weight gain and weight loss, compared with patients taking either medication alone.

Measures

Baseline data included the following: date of birth, gender, race, height, body weight, ICD-10 AD diagnosis, DSM IV AD diagnosis, CAGE score, MALT score, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT).

The primary efficacy outcome was the cumulative abstinence duration (CAD) during the 6-month treatment phase. CAD was the primary endpoint recommended in the Plinius Maior Society guidelines for the evaluation of treatments of AD. European guidelines have since then evolved from 2010 onwards and the proportion of patients continuously abstinent throughout the treatment period (continuous abstinence rate (CAR)) is now the recommended primary endpoint for studies on MoA. However, at the time the GATE 2 study was designed (2000), CAD was still considered the standard primary outcome for studies on the treatment of AD. For example, CAD was widely utilized as the (co-)primary endpoint in acamprosate trials, including those that were used as pivotal evidence in the registration process of the drug for MoA in the European Union. Consequently, it was also defined as a primary outcome in the Cochrane meta-analysis of acamprosate for the MoA in AD patients. CAD is still considered an important secondary endpoint by the. In the current study, CAD was calculated as the number of days with no alcohol use. At treatment group level, CAD measures the differences in CAR as well as the differences in abstinence duration in relapsing patients. It can therefore be conceptualized as a composite endpoint with the current recommended primary endpoint as one of its components. In GATE 2 and due to uncertainty regarding accurate reporting of duration of relapses, if a relapse occurred since the last visit and was reported by the patient at a visit, the entire month before the visit was considered as a period of relapse, irrespective of the declared duration of the relapse. Relapse was defined as any alcohol consumption.

Table 2 shows the main results of the analysis, along with assessments of the quality of evidence for each intervention. The median probability of staying abstinent across placebo arms was 25%. Most interventions showed no or insufficient evidence of an effect on maintaining abstinence greater than placebo. Drug interventions had mixed results, with estimated odds ratios ranging from 0.31 (95% confidence interval 0.11 to 0.87) for galantamine (indicating reduced probability of abstinence compared with placebo) to increased odds of abstinence compared with placebo for four interventions: acamprosate (1.86, 1.49 to 2.33), topiramate (1.88, 1.06 to 3.34), sodium oxybate (2.31, 1.22 to 4.36), and quetiapine (6.75, 1.20 to 38.05). Other drugs licensed for treating alcohol dependence, disulfiram (0.93, 0.48 to 1.79) and naltrexone (1.36, 0.97 to 1.91), were not or were weakly associated with improved abstinence. All psychosocial interventions alone were not associated with a greater probability of maintaining abstinence up to 12 months. Four combined interventions were more effective than placebo at maintaining abstinence: acamprosate and nurse visits (4.59, 1.47 to 14.36), acamprosate and naltrexone (3.68, 1.50 to 9.02), sodium oxybate and naltrexone (12.64, 2.77 to 57.78), and naltrexone and sodium oxybate and escitalopram (25.65, 2.13 to 309.46). Treatment as usual (0.52, 0.29 to 0.94), flupenthixol (0.44, 0.20 to 0.95), and galantamine 0.31 (0.11 to 0.87) were associated with reduced odds of relapse compared with placebo. However, confidence in the evidence of the effect of most interventions, apart from acamprosate and tiapride, was low or very low. The reasons for the low to very low confidence were within study bias, imprecision, and heterogeneity, mainly because the evidence for most interventions was generated from single, small studies.

### Effect of oral acamprosate on abstinence in patients with alcohol dependence in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial: the role of patient motivation [^113JuxNU]. Journal of Psychiatric Research (2006). Low credibility.

This is the first US study to evaluate the clinical efficacy of acamprosate (Campral), a newly FDA-approved medication for maintaining abstinence in patients with alcohol dependence following alcohol withdrawal. We compared effects of the standard 2 g dose (n = 258) and an exploratory 3 g dose of acamprosate (n = 83) versus placebo (n = 260), and evaluated drug safety in a double-blind, placebo-controlled 6-month trial conducted in 21 outpatient clinics across the US. Participants were 601 volunteers with current alcohol dependence recruited primarily by advertisement. All patients concomitantly received eight sessions of brief manual-guided counseling (www.alcoholfree.info). The main outcome measure was the percentage of alcohol-free days over the 6-month study. Self-report was validated by breath alcohol concentration, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and collateral informant interviews. The percentage of abstinent days did not differ significantly across groups in a priori analysis (54.3% for placebo, 56.1% for 2 g, 60.7% for 3 g). Post-hoc analysis controlling for baseline variables and treatment exposure found acamprosate was associated with a significantly higher percentage of abstinent days than placebo (52.3% for placebo, 58.2% for 2 g, 62.7% for 3 g; P = 0.01), with an even greater effect in the subgroup of 241 patients having a baseline goal of abstinence (58.1% for placebo, 70.0% for 2 g, 72.5% for 3 g; P = 0.02). There were no deaths or serious drug-related adverse events. The US study findings suggest that acamprosate is safe and well tolerated in a broadly inclusive sample of alcoholics and appears effective in populations of patients motivated to have a treatment goal of abstinence.

Abstract

Objective

Preventing return to alcohol is of critical importance for patients with alcohol-related cirrhosis and/or alcohol-associated hepatitis. Acamprosate is a widely used treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD). We assessed the impact of acamprosate prescription in patients with advanced liver disease on abstinence rates and clinical outcomes.

Methods

This was a retrospective case–control study. We reviewed data on all patients admitted to a large tertiary centre in the UK with alcohol-related cirrhosis and/or alcohol-associated hepatitis. We used propensity risk score matching to match patients prescribed acamprosate to controls. The primary outcome was repeat hospitalisation.

There were 451 patients who met the inclusion criteria of whom 55 patients were started on acamprosate during their admission. Before matching there were significant differences between the cohorts. Patients who received acamprosate were younger (median age 51 vs 57, p < 0.005), more likely to have a purely alcohol-related admission (53% vs 24%, p < 0.001), and more likely to suffer from a comorbid psychiatric diagnosis (42% vs 20%, p < 0.001). On average patients who were started on acamprosate consumed more alcohol (median 155 units/week vs 80 units/week, p < 0.001), were less likely to have a partner (35% vs 54%, p 0.006) and more likely to be unemployed (67% vs 44%, p < 0.001). After matching for factors with significant differences between groups, we generated a cohort of 53 patients prescribed acamprosate and 53 matched controls. At 1 year there was a significantly higher rate of readmission (85% vs 57%, p < 0.001) in the acamprosate group. There were no statistically significant differences in abstinence rates or mortality at 1 year.

Conclusion

Acamprosate prescription was associated with higher rates of readmission in patients with cirrhosis and/or alcohol-associated hepatitis. This may reflect a greater severity of AUD in those patients or might indicate the limited ability of acamprosate to alter the disease course in this population.

Alcohol use disorders (AUDs) affect ~4–5% of the world population, and impose a major socio-economic burden on global mental health. An imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter signaling cascades in the brain is a main cause of physical dependence in AUD.

Acamprosate (Campral), a taurine analog approved for treatment of alcohol dependence, is known to increase the time to relapse owing to its ability to reduce glutamatergic imbalances in the brain. A meta-analysis of 17 studies with 4087 individuals demonstrated that continuous abstinence rates are significantly higher in acamprosate-treated patients compared with placebo. Additional meta-analyses validate this finding favoring acamprosate as a therapeutic agent for the maintenance of abstinence over other Food and Drug Administration-approved medications for AUD. However, the treatment outcome is not universal as it appears that acamprosate is mainly effective in a sub-population of patients with AUD. This sub-population of patients with AUD may differ from non-responders not only on their clinical characteristics, but also based on their biochemical status. Thus, discovery of biomarkers that are associated with a positive therapeutic response to acamprosate may be essential to prescribe acamprosate over other treatment options.
