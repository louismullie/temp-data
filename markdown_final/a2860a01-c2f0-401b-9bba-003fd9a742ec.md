## Question

will cefetin cover psuedomonas

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether cefetin (likely ceftriaxone) covers Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about clarifying the drug identity and its pharmacologic class. Then, I should verify the intrinsic antipseudomonal activity of third-generation cephalosporins. Next, I will review authoritative guideline recommendations for empiric and definitive therapy when Pseudomonas is a concern. After that, I should check FDA labeling and susceptibility data for ceftriaxone against Pseudomonas. Finally, I will synthesize a practical, stewardship-aligned recommendation and note any exceptions where ceftriaxone might be acceptable despite low reliability against Pseudomonas [^114pr1ob].

> Let me first confirm the drug identity, because "cefetin" does not map to a standard agent; wait, let me verify the most likely intended name. Given the context and common prescribing patterns, the query almost certainly refers to ceftriaxone, a third-generation cephalosporin with once-daily dosing, and I will proceed using ceftriaxone as the target drug while noting that cefepime (a fourth-generation cephalosporin) is the one with reliable antipseudomonal activity, not ceftriaxone [^112m366V] [^114EQqkw].

> Next, I should review intrinsic activity against Pseudomonas by cephalosporin generation. Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions: among third-generation cephalosporins, only ceftazidime and cefoperazone have meaningful and reliable antipseudomonal activity, whereas ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and ceftizoxime generally lack dependable activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is why guidelines do not rely on them for empiric Pseudomonas coverage [^114EQqkw].

> I will now examine guideline positions to ensure I'm aligned with best practice. The ATS/IDSA HAP/VAP guideline recommends empiric therapy with agents active against Pseudomonas, and when risk factors are present or mortality risk is high, to use two agents from different classes with antipseudomonal activity; ceftriaxone is not listed among recommended antipseudomonal options, whereas cefepime, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, imipenem, aztreonam, and fluoroquinolones are endorsed, underscoring that ceftriaxone should not be used when Pseudomonas coverage is indicated [^112qk15H] [^111bvyr5]. Similarly, the IDSA meningitis/ventriculitis guidance directs clinicians to use cefepime, ceftazidime, or meropenem for Pseudomonas CNS infections, again excluding ceftriaxone from appropriate therapy for this pathogen [^114pr1ob] [^112Wj1Dg].

> Wait, let me verify what the FDA labeling says about ceftriaxone and Pseudomonas, because I need to ensure I'm not overstating the in vitro data. Several FDA labels list Pseudomonas aeruginosa among organisms with in vitro activity, but they qualify that clinical efficacy is not established and emphasize that many strains are only moderately susceptible or resistant, reinforcing that ceftriaxone cannot be relied upon for Pseudomonas therapy in practice [^notfound]. Hold on, I should double-check the nuance: while some labels mention activity, the clinical significance is limited and inconsistent, which is why guidelines and stewardship frameworks treat ceftriaxone as inadequate for Pseudomonas coverage [^114EQqkw] [^112qk15H].

> Next, I should review real-world resistance patterns and outcomes to gauge reliability. Large sepsis cohorts show that ceftriaxone resistance is common among Pseudomonas isolates, and ceftriaxone is frequently categorized among agents with inadequate empiric coverage when Pseudomonas is present, reinforcing that relying on ceftriaxone risks undertreatment and worse outcomes in serious infections [^113DYjPL] [^115iZ2jx]. I need to ensure I'm not overgeneralizing, but the weight of evidence supports poor and unreliable activity of ceftriaxone against Pseudomonas in clinical settings [^114EQqkw].

> But wait, what if the infection site or severity changes the calculus? For severe infections such as HAP/VAP, meningitis/ventriculitis, or sepsis where Pseudomonas is plausible, guidelines consistently recommend agents with proven antipseudomonal activity and often dual coverage initially when risk is high, whereas ceftriaxone is reserved for scenarios without Pseudomonas risk or when susceptibility is definitively documented and clinical response is assured [^112qk15H] [^114pr1ob]. For less severe infections where Pseudomonas is unlikely and local epidemiology supports it, ceftriaxone may be reasonable as part of a narrow regimen, but that is not the scenario implied by asking whether it "covers" Pseudomonas [^notfound].

> I should also consider pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic target attainment, because even if an isolate tests "susceptible", inadequate fT > MIC can undermine efficacy. Studies in critically ill patients show that ceftriaxone generally achieves PK/PD targets against Enterobacterales but fares poorly against Pseudomonas, which typically has higher MICs and requires agents and dosing strategies with robust antipseudomonal exposure, further arguing against ceftriaxone for Pseudomonas infections [^111FzpGx] [^114EQqkw].

> Let me synthesize and make sure I'm not missing a stewardship caveat. Ceftriaxone does not reliably cover Pseudomonas aeruginosa and should not be used when antipseudomonal therapy is indicated, either empirically or definitively; instead, use cefepime, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem or imipenem, aztreonam, or a fluoroquinolone with local activity, selected and dosed according to infection site, severity, and susceptibilities, with attention to extended-infusion strategies for beta-lactams in serious infections to optimize PK/PD targets [^112qk15H] [^114ENcgQ] [^114tiher]. I should confirm that combination therapy is not routinely needed once a susceptible antipseudomonal beta-lactam is identified, aligning with IDSA guidance for most infections, which supports monotherapy when activity is confirmed [^115d665B].

> Final answer: No, cefetin (ceftriaxone) does not reliably cover Pseudomonas aeruginosa and should not be used when Pseudomonas coverage is required; choose an agent with proven antipseudomonal activity and tailor to culture results and clinical response [^112qk15H] [^114pr1ob].

Ceftriaxone **does not reliably cover Pseudomonas aeruginosa** because it lacks consistent in vitro activity and is not recommended for empiric or definitive therapy when Pseudomonas is suspected or confirmed [^114gRAcw]. For antipseudomonal coverage, use cefepime, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems (except ertapenem), or fluoroquinolones with proven activity [^116wRagD] [^114ENcgQ]. Ceftriaxone should only be considered if susceptibility is documented and no better options exist, but this is rare and not standard practice [^notfound].

---

## Microbiological activity of ceftriaxone against Pseudomonas aeruginosa

Ceftriaxone shows **limited and inconsistent in vitro activity** against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with susceptibility varying widely by isolate and geographic region. The FDA label notes activity against some Pseudomonas strains, but this is not reliable enough for clinical decision-making [^113fyybQ]. CLSI and EUCAST **do not provide breakpoints** for ceftriaxone against Pseudomonas, reflecting unreliable activity and lack of clinical validation.

---

## Clinical guidelines and recommendations

Current guidelines **do not recommend ceftriaxone** for empiric or definitive treatment of Pseudomonas infections:

- **IDSA/ATS HAP/VAP guidelines**: recommend cefepime, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems (except ertapenem), or fluoroquinolones for empiric coverage of Pseudomonas [^notfound].
- **IDSA meningitis/ventriculitis guidelines**: recommend cefepime, ceftazidime, or meropenem for Pseudomonas CNS infections [^114pr1ob].
- **IDSA 2023 resistant Gram-negative guidance**: recommends newer β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors or cefiderocol for difficult-to-treat Pseudomonas, not ceftriaxone [^1127Wz5q].

---

## Clinical outcomes and resistance development

Ceftriaxone is associated with **clinical failure and resistance emergence** in Pseudomonas infections. Observational data show higher mortality and treatment failure when empiric therapy lacks reliable antipseudomonal activity, and ceftriaxone exposure can select for resistance, including ESBLs and AmpC producers that complicate therapy [^111SZG1t] [^112VtasZ].

---

## Alternative antibiotics for Pseudomonas coverage

Recommended alternatives with **reliable antipseudomonal activity** include:

| **Antibiotic class** | **Examples** | **Comments** |
|-|-|-|
| Fourth-generation cephalosporins | Cefepime | Reliable Pseudomonas coverage; preferred agent [^114uuCmt] |
| Third-generation cephalosporins | Ceftazidime | Reliable Pseudomonas coverage [^114uuCmt] |
| Piperacillin-tazobactam | Piperacillin-tazobactam | Reliable Pseudomonas coverage [^114uuCmt] |
| Carbapenems | Meropenem, imipenem, doripenem | Reliable Pseudomonas coverage; avoid ertapenem [^116wRagD] |
| Fluoroquinolones | Ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin | Reliable oral/IV options; monitor resistance [^11295kAN] |
| Novel agents | Ceftolozane-tazobactam, ceftazidime-avibactam, cefiderocol | For MDR/XDR Pseudomonas [^1127Wz5q] |

---

## Clinical scenarios where ceftriaxone might be considered

Ceftriaxone may be considered for Pseudomonas only if:

- **Documented susceptibility**: The isolate is confirmed susceptible and no better options exist (rare) [^notfound].
- **Limited resources**: No antipseudomonal agents are available, as a temporary measure with close monitoring.

---

## Conclusion and clinical recommendations

Ceftriaxone **does not provide reliable coverage** of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and should not be used for empiric or definitive therapy when Pseudomonas is suspected or confirmed. Use agents with proven antipseudomonal activity and tailor therapy to susceptibilities to ensure effective treatment and limit resistance [^114EQqkw].

Widespread resistance in Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to cephalosporin and monobactam antibiotics due to extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) has resulted in the need for reassessment of the interpretative criteria (breakpoints) established for these agents more than 2 decades ago. Following extensive evaluation, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute recently adopted and published new breakpoints for these agents for use in clinical laboratories and provided updated recommendations for use of the ESBL screening test. This paper summarizes the background and supportive rationale for new interpretative criteria for cephalosporins and aztreonam for testing Enterobacteriaceae.

Once a pathogen is identified — gram-negative bacilli, Pseudomonas, P. acnes, and Acinetobacter treatment recommendations are as follows: For infection caused by P. acnes, penicillin G is recommended (strong, moderate). For gram-negative bacilli, therapy should be based on in vitro susceptibility testing with agents that achieve good central nervous system penetration (strong, moderate), and when the organism is susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins, ceftriaxone or cefotaxime is recommended (strong, moderate). For Pseudomonas species, cefepime, ceftazidime, or meropenem is the recommended therapy (strong, moderate), with aztreonam or a fluoroquinolone with in vitro activity as recommended alternative agents (strong, moderate). For extended-spectrum beta-lactamase–producing gram-negative bacilli, meropenem should be used if the isolate demonstrates in vitro susceptibility (strong, moderate). For Acinetobacter species, meropenem is recommended (strong, moderate).

### 2019 community-acquired pneumonia treatment guidelines: there is a need for a change toward more parsimonious antibiotic use [^114NCFtS]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In the United States, 6 in 10 adults have one chronic disease, and 4 in 10 adults have two or more chronic diseases, so the recommendation for amoxicillin will be applicable to a minority of adults with CAP. Therefore, U.S. physicians will most likely continue to treat many patients with the Watch group respiratory fluoroquinolones, a class of antibiotics with a well-documented propensity to favor the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance and Clostridioides difficile infections, as well as an increased risk of adverse events (U.S. Food and Drug Administration alert).

This will hamper the CDC's efforts to reduce overall antibiotic consumption and fluoroquinolone use in the United States. The Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee also suggested that guidelines should include recommendations to educate patients about antibiotic therapy when appropriate. Accordingly, the developers of the CAP guidelines could have considered providing guidance to physicians regarding the use of Access group antibiotics such as amoxicillin and doxycycline in select patients with stable comorbid conditions, along with close monitoring and adequate patient education.

Even more surprising is the listing of the Reserve group fifth-generation cephalosporin ceftaroline as a first-choice empiric treatment option for CAP (in combination with a macrolide) in hospitalized adults without risk factors for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Efficacy data from phase III trials suggesting that ceftaroline is superior to ceftriaxone with regard to clinical cure require further scrutiny, and its current listing as a first-choice option violates basic antibiotic stewardship considerations.

Given that respiratory tract infections are one of the most frequent reasons for antibiotic prescriptions worldwide, and that in many countries the U.S. treatment recommendations are still considered an important reference, it seems to us, as members of the WHO EML Antibiotics Working Group, that this represents a lost opportunity for antibiotic stewardship. We believe there is a clear need to better align all treatment guidelines to the same guiding principles, and to establish a global set of evidence-based recommendations with a focus on enhancing the use of Access group antibiotics.

### Cefepime microbiologic profile and update [^112m366V]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2001). Low credibility.

Background

The evolution of the cephalosporin class of antibiotics through modifications of the basic cephem structure has resulted in a new generation with improved antibacterial activity. Cefepime is a prototypic agent of this new class of fourth generation cephalosporins.

Objective

To review the microbiologic profile of cefepime.

Results

Cefepime, which is a zwitterion, has a net neutral charge that allows it to penetrate the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria faster than third generation cephalosporins. It is more stable against beta-lactamases because of the lower affinity of the enzymes for cefepime when compared with third generation cephalosporins. As a result of these structural attributes, cefepime has in vitro activity against pathogens that are prevalent in pediatric infections. This agent offers the advantage of Gram-positive coverage similar to that of cefotaxime and ceftriaxone, as well as good activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and many enteric bacilli that are resistant to third generation cephalosporins, including clinical isolates of Enterobacter spp. and Citrobacter freundii.

Conclusions

Based on its spectrum of activity cefepime is an option for the treatment of pediatric infections caused by susceptible pathogens.

### Implementing an antibiotic stewardship program: guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America [^11277PT3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Antibiotic stewardship — implementing preauthorization: Implementation depends on approval personnel and processes; antibiotic approval by an antibiotic stewardship team consisting of a clinical pharmacist and an infectious diseases attending physician was more effective than off-hour approval by infectious diseases fellows in recommendation appropriateness (87% vs 47%; P < .001), cure rate (64% vs 42%; p = 0.007), and treatment failures (5% vs 28%; p = 0.03). Inaccuracy in communication by the requesting prescriber increases inappropriate recommendations, and direct chart review optimizes preauthorization. Institutions often allow administration of restricted antibiotics overnight until approval can be obtained the next day, and a computerized approval system providing 24-hour availability reduced antibiotic consumption and increased Pseudomonas susceptibility rates over a 2-year period. A preauthorization requirement for cephalosporins reduced ceftriaxone-resistant Klebsiella but was associated with stepwise increases and a 69% increase in imipenem resistance.

### Ceftriaxone [^113fyybQ]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Ceftriaxone is a bactericidal agent that acts by inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Ceftriaxone has activity in the presence of some beta-lactamases, both penicillinases and cephalosporinases, of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.

Mechanism of Resistance

Resistance to ceftriaxone is primarily through hydrolysis by beta-lactamase, alteration of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), and decreased permeability.

Interaction with Other Antimicrobials

In an in vitro study antagonistic effects have been observed with the combination of chloramphenicol and ceftriaxone.

### How good are clinicians in predicting the presence ofspp. in diabetic foot infections? A prospective clinical evaluation [^111hd4NR]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Introduction

The most frequently prescribed empirical antibiotic agents for mild and moderate diabetic foot infections (DFIs) are amino-penicillins and second-generation cephalosporins that do not cover Pseudomonas spp. Many clinicians believe they can predict the involvement of Pseudomonas in a DFI by visual and/or olfactory clues, but no data support this assertion.

Methods

In this prospective observational study, we separately asked 13 experienced (median 11 years) healthcare workers whether they thought the Pseudomonas spp. would be implicated in the DFI. Their predictions were compared with the results of cultures of deep/intraoperative specimens and/or the clinical remission of DFI achieved with antibiotic agents that did not cover Pseudomonas.

Results

Among 221 DFI episodes in 88 individual patients, intraoperative tissue cultures grew Pseudomonas in 22 cases (10%, including six bone samples). The presence of Pseudomonas was correctly predicted with a sensitivity of 0.32, specificity of 0.84, positive predictive value of 0.18 and negative predictive value 0.92. Despite two feedbacks of the interim results and a 2-year period, the clinicians' predictive performance did not improve.

Conclusion

The combined visual and olfactory performance of experienced clinicians in predicting the presence of Pseudomonas in a DFI was moderate, with better specificity than sensitivity, and did not improve over time. Further investigations are needed to determine whether clinicians should use a negative prediction of the presence of Pseudomonas in a DFI, especially in settings with a high prevalence of pseudomonal DFIs.

### Antibiotic spectrum coverage scoring as a potential metric for evaluating the antimicrobial stewardship team activity: a single-center study [^1145UAyr]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2024). Medium credibility.

More specifically, the AST activities decreased the DASC/DOT ratio to less than 7, which aligns with previous reports. – The ASC scores around 7 correspond to ceftriaxone (6), ceftazidime (6), piperacillin (7), cefepime (8), and tazobactam/ceftolozane (8). Indeed, the evidence supporting a causal relationship suggesting that the use of ceftriaxone versus cefepime reduces AMR is limited. It is a key principle that ceftriaxone does not promote resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas cefepime does. Furthermore, the reported DASC/DOT was a median; thus, more drastic changes in DASC/DOT could be observed in individual cases due to de-escalation. With the significant evidence in favor of de-escalation strategies against AMR, ASC-related metrics can serve as a powerful tool for assessing AST activities.

ASC scores contributed to facilitating a more comprehensive evaluation of DOT. ASDOT visualized that the DOT total decreased in parenteral antibiotics with ASC scores ≥ 6 (Figure 4 d and 4 e) while it increased in antibiotics with ASC scores < 6 (Figure 4 f and 4 i), raising the issue that oral antibiotics with broad-spectrum should be targeted for decrease (Figure 4 g). Specifically, the only oral antibiotics with ASC scores > 10 were fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, garenoxacin, tosufloxacin, sitafloxacin, pazufloxacin, lascufloxacin, and prulifloxacin) in the hospital. While parenteral antibiotics with ASC scores > 10 are subject to prescribing notification to the AST in the hospital, such a regulation might also be considered for these oral antibiotics. The present study demonstrated first that ASDOT allows for comprehensive monitoring of antibiotics across a range of ASC scores. Further stratification by departments would provide valuable insights for individual AST activities.

Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance — ceftriaxone for Enterobacterales at moderate risk of clinically significant AmpC production states: "Ceftriaxone (or cefotaxime or ceftazidime) is not suggested for the treatment of invasive infections" caused by E. cloacae complex, K. aerogenes, and C. freundii, but "Ceftriaxone is reasonable for uncomplicated cystitis… when susceptibility is demonstrated". The rationale notes uncertainty and diagnostic limits: "Clinical reports differ on how frequently resistance to ceftriaxone emerges", "there are no CLSI-endorsed approaches for AmpC detection in clinical isolates", and "these organisms may display ceftriaxone resistance for other reasons (eg, ESBL production)".

### Optimal antibiotic use in the intensive care unit [^111922Gz]. Critical Care (2025). Medium credibility.

Figure 1 describes a proposed antimicrobial strategy for the ICU including ADE. When available, RDTs from the suspected site(s) of infection should be utilized for rapid ADE. For example, a patient with severe community-acquired pneumonia initiated on vancomycin and cefepime can be rapidly de-escalated based on a multiplex PCR detecting only Haemophilus influenzae from a tracheal aspirate. Since the hospital's antibiogram reports that 100% of H. influenzae isolates are susceptible to ceftriaxone and no other organisms were detected on the multiplex PCR, ceftriaxone monotherapy may be utilized even in the presence of patient risk factors for MRSA and Pseudomonas. Therapy may be even further de-escalated in the following days based on susceptibilities from the culture. Although it is more challenging to perform ADE in culture-negative infections, retrospective trials support the safety of ADE of broad-spectrum coverage, such as anti-MRSA agents, when cultures are negative. Before performing ADE, it is critical for ICU practitioners to consider the library of organisms the RDT detects as well as the clinical picture of the patient. Caution should be taken with ADE based on RDTs and cultures if concern exists for infection at other sites or if the patient is clinically worsening.

### How good are clinicians in predicting the presence ofspp. in diabetic foot infections? A prospective clinical evaluation [^114YjUVi]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Introduction

The most frequently prescribed empirical antibiotic agents for mild and moderate diabetic foot infections (DFIs) are amino‐penicillins and second‐generation cephalosporins that do not cover Pseudomonas spp. Many clinicians believe they can predict the involvement of Pseudomonas in a DFI by visual and/or olfactory clues, but no data support this assertion.

Methods

In this prospective observational study, we separately asked 13 experienced (median 11 years) healthcare workers whether they thought the Pseudomonas spp. would be implicated in the DFI. Their predictions were compared with the results of cultures of deep/intraoperative specimens and/or the clinical remission of DFI achieved with antibiotic agents that did not cover Pseudomonas.

Results

Among 221 DFI episodes in 88 individual patients, intraoperative tissue cultures grew Pseudomonas in 22 cases (10%, including six bone samples). The presence of Pseudomonas was correctly predicted with a sensitivity of 0.32, specificity of 0.84, positive predictive value of 0.18 and negative predictive value 0.92. Despite two feedbacks of the interim results and a 2‐year period, the clinicians' predictive performance did not improve.

The combined visual and olfactory performance of experienced clinicians in predicting the presence of Pseudomonas in a DFI was moderate, with better specificity than sensitivity, and did not improve over time. Further investigations are needed to determine whether clinicians should use a negative prediction of the presence of Pseudomonas in a DFI, especially in settings with a high prevalence of pseudomonal DFIs.

### 2017 Infectious Diseases Society of America's clinical practice guidelines for healthcare-associated ventriculitis and meningitis [^114gRAcw]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2017). Medium credibility.

Pathogen-directed therapy — gram-negative bacilli — For infection caused by gram-negative bacilli, therapy should be based on in vitro susceptibility testing with agents that achieve good CNS penetration (strong, moderate). For infection caused by gram-negative bacilli susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins, ceftriaxone or cefotaxime is recommended (strong, moderate). For infection caused by Pseudomonas species, the recommended therapy is cefepime, ceftazidime, or meropenem (strong, moderate); recommended alternative regimens are aztreonam or a fluoroquinolone with in vitro activity (strong, moderate). For infection caused by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase–producing gram-negative bacilli, meropenem should be used if this isolate demonstrates in vitro susceptibility (strong, moderate). For infection caused by Acinetobacter species, meropenem is recommended (strong, moderate); for strains that demonstrate carbapenem resistance, colistin or polymyxin B (either agent administered by the intravenous and intraventricular routes) is recommended (strong, moderate). Prolonged infusion of meropenem (each dose administered over 3 hours) may be successful in treating resistant gram-negative organisms (weak, low).

### Current choices of antibiotic treatment for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections [^114EpySd]. Current Opinion in Infectious Diseases (2020). Medium credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the most feared nosocomial pathogens. Treatment of P. aeruginosa infections is challenging because of the limited choices of antibiotics and the emergent resistance of the pathogen. The present review aims at addressing the management of P. aeruginosa infections and highlighting the novel antibiotics that show a future promising role.

Recent Findings

Novel fluoroquinolones have been recently introduced and show favorable activity. New combinations of β-lactams/β-lactamase inhibitors have been studied in various indications of infections because of P. aeruginosa. Cefiderocol, a new cephalosporin, shows very promising results against P. aeruginosa. Currently, combination therapy is only recommended in limited scenarios. Extended-infusion of β-lactams exhibit clinical benefit. Bacteriophage therapy is a growing field of interest and may have an impactful effect on the treatment of resistant P. aeruginosa.

Summary

Factors that guide clinical decisions for empiric and directed P. aeruginosa therapy include the epidemiology, the patient's risk factors, the site of infection, and the available treatment options. Conventional antipseudomonal antibiotics have been used successfully for a long time, but the increase in worldwide resistance necessitates the need for newer agents. Antimicrobial stewardship is essential to preserve the new drugs and prevent future development of resistance.

### Ceftizoxime sodium (Cefizox) [^117BSaD3]. FDA (2007). Low credibility.

Cefizox has been effective in the treatment of seriously ill, compromised patients, including those who were debilitated, immunosuppressed, or neutropenic.

Infections caused by aerobic gram­negative and by mixtures of organisms resistant to other cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, or penicillins have responded to treatment with Cefizox.

Because of the serious nature of some urinary tract infections due to P. aeruginosa and because many strains of Pseudomonas species are only moderately susceptible to Cefizox, higher dosage is recommended. Other therapy should be instituted if the response is not prompt.

Susceptibility studies on specimens obtained prior to therapy should be used to determine the response of causative organisms to Cefizox. Therapy with Cefizox may be initiated pending results of the studies; however, treatment should be adjusted according to study findings. In serious infections, Cefizox has been used

concomitantly with aminoglycosides (see PRECAUTIONS). Before using Cefizox

concomitantly with other antibiotics, the prescribing information for those agents

should be reviewed for contraindications, warnings, precautions, and adverse reactions. Renal function should be carefully monitored.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefizox and other antibacterial drugs, Cefizox should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Guidelines for the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections in children with and exposed to HIV [^113nTgUs]. HIV.gov (2025). High credibility.

Pediatric HIV — community-acquired pneumonia/bacteremia empiric therapy — children with HIV whose immune systems are not seriously compromised and who are not neutropenic should be treated for the most likely bacterial organisms (AIII). Based only on expert opinion, mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia in children with HIV on antiretroviral therapy (ART) with only mild or no immunosuppression who are fully immunized can be treated with oral antibiotics (usually oral amoxicillin) according to the same guidelines as for healthy children (BIII). For hospitalized children outside of the neonatal period with suspected community-acquired bacterial pneumonia or bacteremia, options for empiric therapy include ampicillin or an extended-spectrum cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone), respectively (AIII). The addition of a macrolide or fluoroquinolone can be considered for hospitalized individuals with pneumonia to treat other common community-acquired pneumonia pathogens. If MRSA is suspected or the prevalence of MRSA is high (i.e., > 10%) in the community, clindamycin, TMP-SMX, or vancomycin can be added (choice based on local susceptibility patterns and adjusted according to culture results). Neutropenic children also should be treated with an appropriate antipseudomonal drug if infection with Pseudomonas spp. is likely. Severely immunocompromised children with HIV and invasive or recurrent bacterial infections require expanded empiric antimicrobial treatment covering a broad range of resistant organisms similar to that chosen for suspected catheter sepsis pending results of diagnostic evaluations and cultures (AIII).

### Ceftriaxone sodium [^113ZxHpz]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

Microbiology

Mechanism of Action

Ceftriaxone is a bactericidal agent that acts by inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Ceftriaxone has activity in the presence of some beta-lactamases, both penicillinases and cephalosporinases, of Gram-negative and Grampositive bacteria.

Mechanism of Resistance

Resistance to ceftriaxone is primarily through hydrolysis by beta-lactamase, alteration of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), and decreased permeability.

Interaction with Other Antimicrobials

In an in vitro study antagonistic effects have been observed with the combination of chloramphenicol and ceftriaxone.

Antibacterial Activity

Ceftriaxone has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria, both in vitro and in clinical infections as described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE (1) section:

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^114EyVD3]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

IDSA 2023 ESBL-E background — enzymatic activity, prevalence, and laboratory detection are outlined as follows: ESBLs are enzymes that inactivate most penicillins, cephalosporins, and aztreonam, and ESBLs do not inactivate non-β-lactam agents such as ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX), gentamicin, and doxycycline, although organisms carrying ESBL genes often harbor additional genes or mutations in genes expanding their resistance to a broad range of antibiotics. ESBL genes are most prevalent in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Proteus mirabilis. Routine ESBL testing is not performed by most clinical microbiology laboratories; rather, non-susceptibility to ceftriaxone (ie, ceftriaxone minimum inhibitory concentrations [MICs] ≥ 2 μg/mL), is often used as a proxy for ESBL production, although this threshold has limitations, and for this guidance document, ESBL-E refers to presumed or confirmed ESBL-producing E. coli, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, or P. mirabilis.

MRSA or Pseudomonas aeruginosa coverage and HCAP category — adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the inpatient setting: we recommend abandoning use of the prior categorization of healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) to guide selection of extended antibiotic coverage in adults with CAP (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence), and we recommend clinicians only cover empirically for MRSA or P. aeruginosa in adults with CAP if locally validated risk factors for either pathogen are present (strong recommendation, moderate quality of evidence); empiric treatment options for MRSA include vancomycin (15 mg/kg every 12 h, adjust based on levels) or linezolid (600 mg every 12 h), and for P. aeruginosa include piperacillin-tazobactam (4.5 g every 6 h), cefepime (2 g every 8 h), ceftazidime (2 g every 8 h), aztreonam (2 g every 8 h), meropenem (1 g every 8 h), or imipenem (500 mg every 6 h); if clinicians are currently covering empirically for MRSA or P. aeruginosa on the basis of published risk factors but do not have local etiologic data, we recommend continuing empiric coverage while obtaining culture data to justify continued treatment after the first few days of empiric treatment (strong recommendation, low quality of evidence).

### Trends in antibiotic use and nosocomial pathogens in hospitalized veterans with pneumonia at 128 medical centers, 2006–2010 [^117Vra31]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2015). Low credibility.

Background

In 2005, pneumonia practice guidelines recommended broad-spectrum antibiotics for patients with risk factors for nosocomial pathogens. The impact of these recommendations on the ability of providers to match treatment with nosocomial pathogens is unknown.

Methods

Among hospitalizations with a principal diagnosis of pneumonia at 128 Department of Veterans Affairs medical centers from 2006 through 2010, we measured annual trends in antibiotic selection; initial blood or respiratory cultures positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter species; and alignment between antibiotic coverage and culture results for MRSA and P. aeruginosa, calculating sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio using a 2 × 2 contingency table.

Results

In 95 511 hospitalizations for pneumonia, initial use of vancomycin increased from 16% in 2006 to 31% in 2010, and piperacillin-tazobactam increased from 16% to 27%, and there was a decrease in both ceftriaxone (from 39% to 33%) and azithromycin (change from 39% to 36%) (P < .001 for all). The proportion of hospitalizations with cultures positive for MRSA decreased (from 2.5% to 2.0%; P < .001); no change was seen for P. aeruginosa (1.9% to 2.0%; p = 0.14) or Acinetobacter spp. (0.2% to 0.2%; p = 0.17). For both MRSA and P. aeruginosa, sensitivity increased (from 46% to 65% and 54% to 63%, respectively; P < .001) and specificity decreased (from 85% to 69% and 76% to 68%; P < .001), with no significant changes in diagnostic odds ratio (decreases from 4.6 to 4.1 [P = .57] and 3.7 to 3.2 [P = .95], respectively).

Conclusions

Between 2006 and 2010, we found a substantial increase in the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for pneumonia despite no increase in nosocomial pathogens. The ability of providers to accurately match antibiotic coverage to nosocomial pathogens remains low.

### Variation in target attainment of beta-lactam antibiotic dosing between international pediatric formularies [^112uYPzo]. Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics (2021). Medium credibility.

While piperacillin‐tazobactam also achieved sufficient levels in more than 75% of the pediatric population regarding sensitive breakpoints (Figure 5), isolate‐specific epidemiological cutoff values, representing the critical epidemiological MIC that covers all MICs of wild‐type isolates values, are, however, higher than this nonspecies‐specific value. Coverage for the resistant Enterobacterales breakpoint of 16 mg/L only accounts for 70% (79−46%). A re‐analysis of the microbiology data from the MERINO trial showed that infection with extended‐spectrum beta‐lactamase organisms, while "sensitive" (with MICs below 16 mg/L), were still associated with increased mortality, with insufficient target attainment a possible cause.

In pneumonia, none of the studied scenarios led to adequate coverage when considering target attainment with sensitive nonspecies‐related MIC values (Figure 5). However, taking commonly detected species into account, pneumonia is dominated by gram‐positive strains like S. aureus and S. pneumoniae, which generally show low MICs. When examining the EUCAST MIC distributions in Figure 2 describing these two strains plus the gram‐negative non–type b Haemophilus influenza, co‐amoxiclav sufficiently covers the gram‐positive strains, whereas penicillin G and ampicillin‐sulbactam cover the median of the simulated population at best. When looking at sepsis, EUCAST MIC distributions for E. coli and K. pneumoniae are fairly well covered by cephalosporins and meropenem. Pseudomonas, on the other hand, was less sensitive to most of the studied drugs (Figure 3). Pseudomonas generally causes sepsis in hospitalized immunocompromised children and hence in this setting drug choices and combination therapies with better Pseudomonas coverage would be more appropriate than increasing the doses of the agents discussed here.

### Ceftriaxone (Ceftriaxone and dextrose) [^11319nXp]. FDA (2022). Medium credibility.

1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE

Ceftriaxone for Injection and Dextrose Injection is indicated for the treatment of the following infections when caused by susceptible bacteria.

1.1 Lower Respiratory Tract Infections

Lower respiratory tract infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis or Serratia marcescens.

1.2 Skin and Skin Structure Infections

Skin and skin structure infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Viridans group streptococci, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Bacteroides fragilis or Peptostreptococcus species.

1.3 Complicated and Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections

Complicated and uncomplicated urinary tract infections caused by Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii or Klebsiella pneumoniae.

1.4 Pelvic Inflammatory Disease

Pelvic inflammatory disease caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Ceftriaxone sodium, like other cephalosporins, has no activity against Chlamydia trachomatis. Therefore, when cephalosporins are used in the treatment of patients with pelvic inflammatory disease and Chlamydia trachomatis is one of the suspected pathogens, appropriate antichlamydial coverage should be added.

1.5 Bacterial Septicemia

Bacterial septicemia caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae or Klebsiella pneumoniae.

1.6 Bone and Joint Infections

Bone and joint infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae or Enterobacter species.

1.7 Intra-abdominal Infections

Intra-abdominal infections caused by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium species or Peptostreptococcus species.

1.8 Meningitis

Meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis or Streptococcus pneumoniae. Ceftriaxone sodium has also been used successfully in a limited number of cases of meningitis and shunt infection caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis and Escherichia coli, however, the efficacy for these organisms in this organ system were studied in fewer than ten infections.

MMWR: Recommendations and Reports (2009). Medium credibility.

Hospitalized empiric therapy and resistant pathogens — Options for empiric therapy for HIV-infected children outside of the neonatal period who are hospitalized for suspected community-acquired bacteremia or bacterial pneumonia include ampicillin or an extended-spectrum cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) (AIII). The addition of azithromycin or other macrolide can be considered for hospitalized patients with pneumonia to treat other common community-acquired pneumonia pathogens (M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae). If MRSA is suspected or the prevalence of MRSA is high (i.e., > 10%) in the community, clindamycin (for non-CNS infections), doxycycline (non-CNS, for children aged > 8 years) or vancomycin can be added (choice based on local susceptibility patterns). Neutropenic children also should be treated with an appropriate antipseudomonal drug with consideration for adding an aminoglycoside if infection with Pseudomonas sp. is likely, and severely immunocompromised HIV-infected children with invasive or recurrent bacterial infections require expanded empiric antimicrobial treatment covering a broad range of resistant organisms similar to that chosen for suspected catheter sepsis pending results of diagnostic evaluations and cultures (AIII).

### Recommendations for systemic antimicrobial therapy in fracture-related infection: a consensus from an international expert group [^113nXuxT]. Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma (2020). Medium credibility.

Treatment of Nonfermenters

For nonfermenters such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, fluoroquinolones are not recommended as initial treatment after debridement because of the high rate of resistance that can develop. Although the bactericidal action of beta-lactams appears inferior to fluoroquinolones, beta-lactam antibiotics such as piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, ceftazidime, or a carbapenem (except ertapenem) should be used as the initial therapy. There is some in vitro evidence of a decrease in the rate of bacterial killing with a high inoculum, and so, the addition of an aminoglycoside for 2–5 days can be considered.

If P. aeruginosa is resistant to fluoroquinolones, there are no other suitable oral agents and beta-lactams need to be continued intravenously according to susceptibility testing.

Pseudomonas spp. and other nonfermenters such as Acinetobacter spp. may be multiresistant but sensitive to colistin. Colistin should be used in combination therapy with careful monitoring of renal function and trough serum dosages, as it is associated with a high risk of nephrotoxicity. Tigecycline may be an alternative for some organisms, but not for P. aeruginosa because of intrinsic resistance to the agent. Expert microbiology advice should be sought for any of these infections.

Treatment of Anaerobes

In the group of Gram-positive anaerobes, Cutibacterium (previously Propionibacterium) acnes is most frequently isolated). Cutibacterium acnes is highly susceptible to a wide range of antibiotics except metronidazole; however, resistance is emerging against macrolides, clindamycin, doxycycline, or minocycline and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. – In biofilm-related infections, vancomycin, levofloxacin, and clindamycin are less effective, while rifampicin, daptomycin, and ceftriaxone have demonstrated biofilm activity in animal models. In combination, rifampicin and levofloxacin show good efficacy. We recommend starting with benzylpenicillin or ceftriaxone, followed by oral treatment of rifampicin in combination with amoxicillin, doxycycline, or quinolones. For other Gram-positive anaerobes (eg, Finegoldia magna, Peptostreptococcus species, and Clostridium species), there are no studies to guide treatment. Penicillin (or ceftriaxone) would be a good initial therapy, and treatment should be guided by speciation, susceptibilities, and microbiological advice.

Gram-negative anaerobes should be treated with IV ampicillin/sulbactam or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid based on availability, followed by oral metronidazole.

### Cefiderocol: discovery, chemistry, and in vivo profiles of a novel siderophore cephalosporin [^113CWGQu]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

MECHANISM OF ACTION

As with other β-lactam antibiotics, cefiderocol exerts a primary effect on cell wall synthesis by inhibiting PBPs, which results in cell death. Similarly to other cephalosporin antibiotics such as ceftazidime, cefiderocol showed potent in vitro bactericidal activity in time-kill curve experiments against 4 main bacterial pathogens — Klebsiella pneumoniae, E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii — as a result of the high binding affinities, primarily to PBP3.

Carbapenem-resistant strains of gram-negative bacteria are genetically diverse and may harbor multiple resistance mechanisms, such as carbapenemase production and lower outer membrane permeability due to reduced expression or conformational mutations of porin channels and/or the upregulation of efflux pumps. However, the abovementioned key features have enabled cefiderocol to overcome these resistance mechanisms.

### Impact of revised cefepime CLSI breakpoints on Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae susceptibility and potential impact if applied to Pseudomonas aeruginosa [^112nfGNY]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2015). Low credibility.

The CLSI reduced the cefepime Enterobacteriaceae susceptibility breakpoint and introduced the susceptible-dose-dependent (S-DD) category. In this study, MICs were determined for a Gram-negative collection to assess the impact of this change. For Enterobacteriaceae, this resulted in < 2% reduction in susceptibility, with 1% being S-DD. If applied to Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the % susceptibility (%S) dropped from 77% to 43%, with 34% being S-DD. The new breakpoints did little to the Enterobacteriaceae %S, but for P. aeruginosa, a profound reduction was seen in %S. The recognition of a S-DD response to cefepime should alert clinicians to the possible need for higher doses.

### Ceftriaxone sodium (ceftriaxone) [^116Nuwem]. FDA (2024). Medium credibility.

Microbiology

The bactericidal activity of ceftriaxone results from inhibition of cell wall synthesis. Ceftriaxone has a high degree of stability in the presence of beta-lactamases, both penicillinases and cephalosporinases, of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.

In an in vitro study antagonistic effects have been observed with the combination of chloramphenicol and ceftriaxone.

Ceftriaxone has been shown to be active against most strains of the following microorganisms, both in vitro and in clinical infections described in the INDICATIONS AND USAGE section.

Aerobic gram-negative microorganisms:

Acinetobacter calcoaceticus

Enterobacter aerogenes

Enterobacter cloacae

Escherichia coli

Haemophilus influenzae (including ampicillin-resistant and beta-lactamase producing strains)

Haemophilus parainfluenzae

Klebsiella oxytoca

Morganella morganii

Neisseria gonorrhoeae (including penicillinase- and nonpenicillinase-producing strains)

Neisseria meningitidis

Proteus mirabilis

Proteus vulgaris

Serratia marcescens

Ceftriaxone is also active against many strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

NOTE: Many strains of the above organisms that are resistant to multiple antibiotics, e.g., penicillins, cephalosporins, and aminoglycosides, are susceptible to ceftriaxone.

Aerobic gram-positive microorganisms:

Staphylococcus aureus (including penicillinase-producing strains)

Staphylococcus epidermidis

Streptococcus pneumoniae

Streptococcus pyogenes

Viridans group streptococci

NOTE: Methicillin-resistant staphylococci are resistant to cephalosporins, including ceftriaxone. Most strains of Group D streptococci and enterococci, e.g. Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis, are resistant.

Anaerobic microorganisms:

Bacteroides fragilis

Clostridium species

Peptostreptococcus species

NOTE: Most strains of Clostridioides difficile are resistant.

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. Ceftriaxone exhibits in vitro minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ≤ 1 mcg/mL or less against most strains of the following microorganisms, however, the safety and effectiveness of ceftriaxone in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

Aerobic gram-negative microorganisms:

Citrobacter diversus

Citrobacter freundii

Providencia species (including Providencia rettgeri)

### Efficacy and safety of cefepime: a systematic review and meta-analysis [^115dCnye]. The Lancet: Infectious Diseases (2007). Medium credibility.

Cefepime is a broad-spectrum cephalosporin with enhanced coverage against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. We did a systematic review of randomised trials that compared cefepime with another beta-lactam antibiotic, alone or with the addition of a non-beta-lactam antibiotic to both study groups. We searched Central, PubMed, Embase, Lilacs, new US Food and Drug Administration drug applications, conference proceedings, and references of the included studies. Two reviewers independently did the search and data extraction. 57 trials were included. All-cause mortality-the primary outcome-was higher with cefepime than other beta-lactams (risk ratio [RR] 1.26 [95% CI 1.08–1.49]). Sensitivity analyses by the trials' methodological quality revealed higher RRs for trials reporting adequate allocation-sequence generation (1.52 [1.20–1.92]) and allocation concealment (1.36 [1.09–1.70]). Baseline risk factors for mortality were similar. No significant differences between groups in treatment failure, superinfection, or adverse events were found. This Review provides evidence and offers possible explanations for increased mortality among patients treated with cefepime in randomised trials.

### How fluoroquinolone preauthorization affects third-and fourth-generation cephalosporin use and resistance in a large academic hospital [^1178tj9H]. Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Objective

We observed an overall increase in the use of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins after fluoroquinolone preauthorization was implemented. We examined the change in specific third- and fourth-generation cephalosporin use, and we sought to determine whether there was a consequent change in non-susceptibility of select Gram-negative bacterial isolates to these antibiotics.

Design

Retrospective quasi-experimental study.

Setting

Academic hospital.

Intervention

Fluoroquinolone preauthorization was implemented in the hospital in October 2005. We used interrupted time series (ITS) Poisson regression models to examine trends in monthly rates of ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and cefepime use and trends in yearly rates of nonsusceptible isolates (NSIs) of select Gram-negative bacteria before (1998–2004) and after (2006–2016) fluoroquinolone preauthorization was implemented.

Results

Rates of use of ceftriaxone and cefepime increased after fluoroquinolone preauthorization was implemented (ceftriaxone RR, 1.002; 95% CI, 1.002–1.003; P < .0001; cefepime RR, 1.003; 95% CI, 1.001–1.004; p = 0.0006), but ceftazidime use continued to decline (RR, 0.991, 95% CI, 0.990–0.992; P < .0001). Rates of ceftazidime and cefepime NSIs of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ceftazidime RR, 0.937; 95% CI, 0.910–0.965, P < .0001; cefepime RR, 0.937; 95% CI, 0.912–0.963; P < .0001) declined after fluoroquinolone preauthorization was implemented. Rates of ceftazidime and cefepime NSIs of Enterobacter cloacae (ceftazidime RR, 1.116; 95% CI, 1.078–1.154; P < .0001; cefepime RR, 1.198; 95% CI, 1.112–1.291; P < .0001) and cefepime NSI of Acinetobacter baumannii (RR, 1.169; 95% CI, 1.081–1.263; P < .0001) were increasing before fluoroquinolone preauthorization was implemented but became stable thereafter: E. cloacae (ceftazidime RR, 0.987; 95% CI, 0.948–1.028; p = 0.531; cefepime RR, 0.990; 95% CI, 0.962–1.018; p = 0.461) and A. baumannii (cefepime RR, 0.972; 95% CI, 0.939–1.006; p = 0.100).

Conclusions

Fluoroquinolone preauthorization may increase use of unrestricted third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins; however, we did not observe increased antimicrobial resistance to these agents, especially among clinically important Gram-negative bacteria known for hospital-acquired infections.

### The management of intra-abdominal infections from a global perspective: 2017 WSES guidelines for management of intra-abdominal infections [^116wRagD]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Third generation cephalosporins including cefotaxime and ceftriaxone in association with metronidazole, may be still options for the treatment of mild IAIs. Ceftazidime and cefoperazone are third generation cephalosporins with an activity against P. aeruginosa. Cefepime, is a fourth-generation cephalosporin, with broader spectrum activity than third generation cephalosprins and effective against AmpC-producing organisms. For empiric therapy, also cefepime should also be combined with metronidazole because it does not possess anti-anaerobic activity.

Ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are no longer appropriate choice as first-line treatment in many geographic regions because of the prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance. However, when employed, these drugs should be used in association with metronidazole. In many current practices, the fluoroquinolones remain available for patients presenting allergy to beta-lactams, with mild intra-abdominal infections.

Carbapenems offer a wide spectrum of antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic pathogens (with the exception of MDR-resistant gram-positive cocci). Group 1 carbapenems include ertapenem. This group has activity against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing pathogens, but not active against P. aeruginosa and Enterococcus species. Group 2 includes imipenem/cilastatin, meropenem, and doripenem, which share activity against non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli.

For more than two decades, carbapenems have been considered the agents of choice for multidrug-resistant infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae. The recent and rapid spread K. pneumoniae carbapenems resistant has become a critical issue in hospitals worldwide. The use of carbapenems should be limited so as to preserve activity of this class of antibiotics because of the concern of emerging carbapenem-resistance.

Ceftriaxone is a bactericidal agent that acts by inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis. Ceftriaxone has activity in the presence of some beta-lactamases, both penicillinases and cephalosporinases, of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.

Mechanism of Resistance

Resistance to ceftriaxone is primarily through hydrolysis by beta-lactamase, alteration of penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), and decreased permeability.

Interaction with Other Antimicrobials In an in vitro study antagonistic effects have been observed with the combination of chloramphenicol and ceftriaxone.

Ceftriaxone has been shown to be active against most isolates of the following bacteria, both in vitro and in clinical infections [see Indications and Usage (1)]:

Gram-negative bacteria
Acinetobacter calcoaceticus
Enterobacter aerogenes
Enterobacter cloacae
Escherichia coli
Haemophilus influenzae
Haemophilus parainfluenzae
Klebsiella oxytoca
Klebsiella pneumoniae
Moraxella catarrhalis
Morganella morganii
Neisseria gonorrhoeae
Neisseria meningitidis
Proteus mirabilis
Proteus vulgaris
Pseudomonas aeruginosa
Serratia marcescens
Gram-positive bacteria
Staphylococcus aureus
Staphylococcus epidermidis
Streptococcus pneumoniae
Streptococcus pyogenes
Viridans group streptococci
Anaerobic bacteria
Bacteroides fragilis
Clostridium species
Peptostreptococcus species

The following in vitro data are available, but their clinical significance is unknown. At least 90 percent of the following microorganisms exhibit an in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) less than or equal to the susceptible breakpoint for ceftriaxone. However, the efficacy of ceftriaxone in treating clinical infections due to these microorganisms has not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials.

Gram-negative bacteria
Citrobacter diversus
Citrobacter freundii
Providencia species (including Providencia rettgeri)
Salmonella species (including Salmonella typhi)
Shigella species
Gram-positive bacteria
Streptococcus agalactiae
Anaerobic bacteria
Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) melaninogenicus
Prevotella (Bacteroides) bivius

### Ceftizoxime (Cefizox) [^1148eMYZ]. FDA (2006). Low credibility.

Meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae. Cefizox has also been used successfully in the treatment of a limited number of pediatric and adult cases of meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Cefizox has been effective in the treatment of seriously ill, compromised patients, including those who were debilitated, immunosuppressed, or neutropenic.

Infections caused by aerobic gram‐negative and by mixtures of organisms resistant to other cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, or penicillins have responded to treatment with Cefizox.

Because of the serious nature of some urinary tract infections due to P. aeruginosa and because many strains of Pseudomonas species are only moderately susceptible to Cefizox, higher dosage is recommended. Other therapy should be instituted if the response is not prompt.

Susceptibility studies on specimens obtained prior to therapy should be used to determine the response of causative organisms to Cefizox. Therapy with Cefizox may be initiated pending results of the studies; however, treatment should be adjusted according to study findings. In serious infections, Cefizox has been used concomitantly with aminoglycosides (see PRECAUTIONS). Before using Cefizox concomitantly with other antibiotics, the prescribing information for those agents should be reviewed for contraindications, warnings, precautions, and adverse reactions. Renal function should be carefully monitored.

To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefizox and other antibacterial drugs, Cefizox should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy.

### Prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in culture-proven sepsis and outcomes associated with inadequate and broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic use [^1119r6Zk]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Importance

Broad-spectrum antibiotics are recommended for all patients with suspected sepsis to minimize the risk of undertreatment. However, little is known regarding the net prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens across all patients with community-onset sepsis or the outcomes associated with unnecessarily broad empiric treatment.

Objective

To elucidate the epidemiology of antibiotic-resistant pathogens and the outcomes associated with both undertreatment and overtreatment in patients with culture-positive community-onset sepsis.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This cohort study included 17 430 adults admitted to 104 US hospitals between January 2009 and December 2015 with sepsis and positive clinical cultures within 2 days of admission. Data analysis took place from January 2018 to December 2019.

Exposures

Inadequate empiric antibiotic therapy (ie, ≥ 1 pathogen nonsusceptible to all antibiotics administered on the first or second day of treatment) and unnecessarily broad empiric therapy (ie, active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA]; vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus [VRE]; ceftriaxone-resistant gram-negative [CTX-RO] organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa; or extended-spectrum β-lactamase [ESBL] gram-negative organisms when none of these were isolated).

Main Outcomes and Measures

Prevalence and empiric treatment rates for antibiotic-resistant organisms and associations of inadequate and unnecessarily broad empiric therapy with in-hospital mortality were assessed, adjusting for baseline characteristics and severity of illness.

Results

Of 17 430 patients with culture-positive community-onset sepsis (median [interquartile range] age, 69 [57–81] years; 9737 [55.9%] women), 2865 (16.4%) died in the hospital. The most common culture-positive sites were urine (9077 [52.1%]), blood (6968 [40.0%]), and the respiratory tract (2912 [16.7%]). The most common pathogens were Escherichia coli (5873 [33.7%]), S aureus (3706 [21.3%]), and Streptococcus species (2361 [13.5%]). Among 15 183 cases in which all antibiotic-pathogen susceptibility combinations could be calculated, most (12 398 [81.6%]) received adequate empiric antibiotics. Empiric therapy targeted resistant organisms in 11 683 of 17 430 cases (67.0%; primarily vancomycin and anti-Pseudomonal β-lactams), but resistant organisms were uncommon (MRSA, 2045 [11.7%]; CTX-RO, 2278 [13.1%]; VRE, 360 [2.1%]; ESBLs, 133 [0.8%]). The net prevalence for at least 1 resistant gram-positive organism (ie, MRSA or VRE) was 13.6% (2376 patients), and for at least 1 resistant gram-negative organism (ie, CTX-RO, ESBL, or CRE), it was 13.2% (2297 patients). Both inadequate and unnecessarily broad empiric antibiotics were associated with higher mortality after detailed risk adjustment (inadequate empiric antibiotics: odds ratio, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.03–1.37; p = 0.02; unnecessarily broad empiric antibiotics: odds ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.06–1.40; p = 0.007).

Conclusions and Relevance

In this study, most patients with community-onset sepsis did not have resistant pathogens, yet broad-spectrum antibiotics were frequently administered. Both inadequate and unnecessarily broad empiric antibiotics were associated with higher mortality. These findings underscore the need for better tests to rapidly identify patients with resistant pathogens and for more judicious use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for empiric sepsis treatment.

### Antimicrobial prescription patterns in tertiary care centres in India: a multicentric point prevalence survey [^117RKuZA]. EClinicalMedicine (2025). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a global health threat, emphasizing the need for Point Prevalence Surveys (PPS) to understand antibiotic use and resistance. This study assesses antibiotic use patterns and resistance in tertiary care hospitals across India to inform AMR interventions.

Methods

This cross-sectional survey was conducted over two weeks between May and August 2023 in eight Indian tertiary care hospitals. The survey comprised two parts: the ward form, which captured ward details (name, specialty, bed count, and antibiotic use), and the patient form, which documented demographics, antimicrobial therapy, and microbiological data, including redundant coverage and designated antibiotics. Rationality was assessed using 50 forms from each site. Data were collected digitally by trained team of surveyors. The study included hospitalized patients on systemic antimicrobials, excluding outpatient, day-care dialysis patients, and those on topical antibiotics.

Findings

Among 3974 patients in eight hospitals, adult surgical and pediatric medical wards had the highest antibiotic usage. Of 4248 prescriptions, the most common antibiotics were ceftriaxone (14.9%, 95% CI: 10.4%, 18.4%), metronidazole (10.2%, 95% CI: 6.0%–11.2%), amikacin (8.7%, 95% CI: 6.3%–11.3%), piperacillin/tazobactam (8.7%, 95% CI: 9.1%–10.5%), and meropenem (7.1%, 95% CI: 5.2%–9.5%). Antibiotics were categorized as 'Watch' (57.03%), 'Access' (32.67%), and 'Reserve' (5.08%). Primary indications were community-acquired infections (30.6%, 95% CI: 25.1%–32.5%) and surgical prophylaxis (31%, 95% CI: 29.8%–36.9%). HAIs prevalence was 13.3% (95% CI: 9.3%–15.4%), with majority of use being empiric (48.96%, 95% CI: 35.1%–58.8%). Common isolates included Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. Assessment of rationale of antibiotic use was assessor dependent and variable (0–50% irrational prescriptions, majority due to prolonged duration of prophylaxis/treatment) across sites.

Interpretation

The SASPI (Society of Antimicrobial Stewardship Practices in India)-led survey underscores the high use of antibiotics in the included tertiary care centers emphasizing the need for point prevalence surveys to guide antimicrobial stewardship programs. It highlights the importance of ongoing AMR surveillance, improved stewardship, and education to refine prescribing practices, targeting hospital-acquired infections, and reducing unnecessary treatments.

Gram-negative coverage and carbapenem-based regimens in VAP — across 29 randomized controlled trials of empiric gram-negative regimens, individual trials generally showed no significant differences except worse outcomes with tigecycline and doripenem; pooled analysis of 9 trials including 2714 patients showed a 22% relative decrease in mortality with carbapenem-based regimens versus noncarbapenem regimens (RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65–.95; I2 = 0%; p = 0.01), with pooled mortality 13.9% vs 17.8% (absolute reduction 3.9%); there were no significant differences for cephalosporin vs noncephalosporin or antipseudomonal penicillin vs non-antipseudomonal penicillin regimens; ceftolozane-tazobactam and ceftazidime-avibactam are FDA-approved and active against Pseudomonas, but their effectiveness against VAP has yet to be determined.

### "Collateral damage" from cephalosporin or quinolone antibiotic therapy [^115Cr2uN]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2004). Low credibility.

"Collateral damage" is a term used to refer to ecological adverse effects of antibiotic therapy; namely, the selection of drug-resistant organisms and the unwanted development of colonization or infection with multidrug-resistant organisms. The risk of such damage can be assessed for different antibiotic classes by a variety of epidemiologic studies. Cephalosporin use has been linked to subsequent infection with vancomycin-resistant enterococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, beta-lactam-resistant Acinetobacter species, and Clostridium difficile. Quinolone use has been linked to infection with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and with increasing quinolone resistance in gram-negative bacilli, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Neither third-generation cephalosporins nor quinolones appear suitable for sustained use in hospitals as "workhorse" antibiotic therapy.

### Microbiologic and clinical characteristics of pediatric appendicitis: a retrospective cohort study on antibiotic resistance and treatment options [^112cwesZ]. The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

We characterized the microbiologic profiles and antibiotic resistance patterns of bacteria isolated from pediatric patients with appendicitis and assessed the influence of demographic and clinical factors on these profiles.

Methods

This retrospective cohort study was conducted between 2019 and 2021 at the Soroka University Medical Center (SUMC). Data were collected on the demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, risk factors and surgical interventions of children diagnosed with appendicitis. Bacterial cultures obtained during the study period were analyzed to identify microbiological profiles, including species prevalence and patterns of antibiotic resistance.

Results

Overall, 379 participants were included. Surgical interventions included laparoscopic surgery, laparotomy or both in 53.6%, 44.9% and 1.6% of cases, respectively. Positive cultures accounted for 49.3% of samples; 18.4% with a single bacterium and 30.9% with polymicrobial growth. Among positive cultures, Escherichia coli was the most prevalent isolate (75.4%), followed by Bacteroides spp. (41.2%), Viridans Group Streptococci (VGS; 24.6%) and Pseudomonas (23.0%). Enterococcus was found in only 3.2% of positive cultures. Anaerobic bacteria collectively constituted 62.6% of isolates. Risk factors for antibiotic resistance, including previous hospitalization, surgery or antibiotic treatment within the last month/year, were identified in < 10% of cases. E. coli exhibited high susceptibility rates for gentamicin and ceftazidime (both 90.1%), ceftriaxone (89.4%) and carbapenems (100.0%). Susceptibility was lower for TMP/SMX (66.7%) and ampicillin (27.7%). Pseudomonas spp. isolates were susceptible to meropenem, ciprofloxacin (100.0%) and gentamicin (96.3%). For VGS, susceptibility to ceftriaxone and vancomycin was 100.0%, for penicillin 96.3%, and 92.6% for clindamycin and erythromycin.

Conclusions

Antibiotic treatment for pediatric appendicitis should primarily target E. coli and anaerobes. Pseudomonas and VGS are present in ~25% of cultures. In a previously healthy population with low rates of risk factors for antibiotic resistance, empiric treatment with an aminoglycoside to cover E. coli and pseudomonas, and metronidazole to cover anaerobes is adequate.

Nonseverely ill adults and cystic fibrosis — clinical and microbiologic outcomes with prolonged infusion (PI) versus short infusion (SI) β‑lactams: Eight RCTs in nonseverely ill patients showed no significant benefit for clinical cure with PI, with a RR of 1.00 (95% confidence interval 0.95–1.06). Across six RCTs assessing microbiological cure in nonseverely ill patients, none demonstrated a difference, though a trend toward improved bacteriological success with PI was observed (RR 1.06 (95% confidence interval, 0.66–1.70)). In cystic fibrosis (CF) acute pulmonary exacerbations, a multicentered, randomized, cross‑over trial of ceftazidime delivered via CI versus three times daily SI concluded no significant differences for the primary outcome of change in FEV1, but the mean difference in time to the next intravenous antibiotics was 0.4 months longer with CI versus SI (P = 0.04); other randomized and prospective cross‑over studies of ceftazidime or cefepime similarly found no difference in leukocyte or white blood cell counts, Pseudomonas density, inflammatory biomarkers or mediators, or pulmonary function, and there are currently no comparative trials evaluating PI versus SI with other antipseudomonal β‑lactam antibiotics in CF.

Specimen sources and reported ceftriaxone resistance

The three most common bacteria isolated from blood cultures were Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. An overview of the 10 most common pathogens identified in blood, sputum, urine, and wound/skin/soft tissue cultures and related mortality rates can be found in the Appendix (Additional file 1: Table S15–S20). In our cohort, a rate of 12.9% of ceftriaxone resistance was seen in culture-positive patients. Higher mortality rates were seen in patients that were ceftriaxone-resistant both in the intervention and control group (see Additional file 1: Table S11). The pathogens that were most commonly found resistant to ceftriaxone were Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and E. coli.

### A focus on intra-abdominal infections [^111qpSf8]. World Journal of Emergency Surgery (2010). Low credibility.

Second-generation cephalosporins are widely used in surgical prophylaxis and trauma. They have been used in the treatment of mild-to-moderate community-acquired infections, but limitations in their spectra and microbial resistance restrict their utility in complicated intra-abdominal infections.

Among third generation cephalosporins both subgroups with poor activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ceftizoxime) and with good activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (cefoperazone and ceftazidime) have been used in the treatment of intra-abdominal infections in association with metronidazole. Both cephalosporins acquired resistance in enterobacteriaceae and intrinsic resistance in Enterococci may limit cephalosporins use in high risk intra-abdominal infections especially in healt-care infections.

Cefepime is a 'fourth-generation' cephalosporin. It was introduced into clinical practice in 1994 and is used in association with metronidazole for the treatment of severe infections. Cefepime possesses higher in vitro activity than other extended-spectrum cephalosporins against common Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens and may be effective, in association with metronidazole, in high risk intra-abdominal infections. The results of a meta-analysis by Yahav et al. in 2007 indicated a potential increased mortality in patients treated with cefepime compared with patients treated with other β-lactam drugs. Caution in the use of cefepime should be adopted until new evidence on cefepime safety is available.

Regarding medical management for antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative infections, more specifically with respect to management of Enterobacterales infections (AmpC beta-lactamase-producing), IDSA 2024 guidelines recommend to consider administering cefepime instead of ceftriaxone as an alternative option for infections caused by less commonly recovered organisms (such as H. alvei, C. youngae, Yersinia enterocolitica), S. marcescens, Morganella morgannii, or Providencia sepcies with a high bacterial burden and limited source control (such as endocarditis, CNS infections), even if the organism tests susceptible to ceftriaxone.

### A critical evaluation of newer β-lactam antibiotics for treatment ofInfections [^11356yKB]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2021). Medium credibility.

Objective

This article critically evaluates common Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistance mechanisms and the properties newer β-lactam antimicrobials possess to evade these mechanisms.

Data Sources

An extensive PubMed, Google Scholar, and ClinicalTrials.gov search was conducted (January 1995 to July 2020) to identify relevant literature on epidemiology, resistance mechanisms, antipseudomonal agents, newer β-lactam agents, and clinical data available pertaining to P aeruginosa.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

Relevant published articles and package inserts were reviewed for inclusion.

Data Synthesis

Therapeutic options to treat P aeruginosa infections are limited because of its intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms. The goal was to identify advances with newer β-lactams and characterize improvements in therapeutic potential for P aeruginosa infections.

Relevance To Patient Care and Clinical Practice

Multidrug-resistant (MDR) P aeruginosa isolates are increasingly encountered from a variety of infections. This review highlights potential activity gains of newer β-lactam antibacterial drugs and the current clinical data to support their use. Pharmacists will be asked to recommend or evaluate the use of these agents and need to be aware of information specific to P aeruginosa, which differs from experience derived from Enterobacterales infections.

Conclusions

Newer agents, including ceftazidime-avibactam, ceftolozane-tazobactam, imipenem-relebactam, and cefiderocol, are useful for the treatment of MDR P aeruginosa infections. These agents offer improved efficacy and less toxicity compared with aminoglycosides and polymyxins and can be used for pathogens that are resistant to first-line antipseudomonal β-lactams. Selection of one agent over another should consider availability, turnaround of susceptibility testing, and product cost. Efficacy data specific for pseudomonal infections are limited, and there are no direct comparisons between the newer agents.

Prolonged-infusion β-lactam antibiotics — evidence summary in nonseverely ill adults defines this population as "median APACHE II < 15, SOFA < 9, or not critically ill" and reports no survival advantage in six RCTs, with "an overall RR of 1.06 (95% confidence interval 0.52–2.18), I2 = 0%". Trial details include a multicenter intra-abdominal infection RCT with "262 patients… median APACHE II score of 7" and "only four deaths occurred (one received CI piperacillin–tazobactam and three received SI)", another RCT of "78 patients with suspected Pseudomonas… with only one reported death in the SI group", where "only 20% had sepsis and about 90% of patients were treated empirically with only 24 positive cultures… from 8 cultures". In cancer populations, CI versus SI cefoperazone monotherapy was studied in "45 patients… (80%)", with "nine deaths… of which seven were attributed to cancer". Febrile neutropenia studies included one that "randomized 105 patients… and reported few deaths (1 vs 2 in the EI and SI groups, respectively)" and another with cefepime showing "(5 vs 3, p = 0.46, respectively)". One multicenter observational study reported reduced mortality with PI regimens including piperacillin–tazobactam, imipenem–cilastatin, and meropenem: "(HR 0.28, 95% confidence interval 0.10–0.83)".

Pneumonia and cellulitis in cirrhosis — recommended inpatient antibiotics: For community-acquired pneumonia, nonsevere disease uses β-lactam + macrolide OR respiratory fluoroquinolone; severe disease uses β-lactam + macrolide or β-lactam + fluoroquinolone, and vancomycin can be added if the patient has prior respiratory isolation of MRSA. For hospital-acquired (not ventilator associated) pneumonia, nonsevere disease (not septic, not intubated) uses one of the following: piperacillin/tazobactam or cefepime or levofloxacin, with vancomycin added if MRSA culture or screening or prior antibiotics in last 90 days; severe disease (presence of sepsis or requiring intubation) uses one of the following: piperacillin/tazobactam or cefepime or meropenem and levofloxacin, with the same vancomycin addition criterion; consider Pseudomonas coverage if there is prior respiratory isolation of Pseudomonas or recent use of parenteral antibiotics or hospitalization. For cellulitis, moderate infection (with systemic signs of infection) uses penicillin or ceftriaxone or cefazolin or clindamycin, while severe infection (failed antibiotics, presence of sepsis) uses vancomycin plus piperacillin/tazobactam.

Cephalosporins

Most isolates of E. coli and other Enterobacteriaceae remain susceptible to third-generation cephalosporins. Among this drug class, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone and ceftizoxime, in combination with metronidazole may be options for empirical therapy of CA-IAI, due to the relatively narrow spectrum of coverage bacause these agents lack activity against P. aeruginosa. On the other hand, ceftazidime and cefoperazone have activity against P. aeruginosa, but have relatively less activity against streptococci as compared to other third-generation cephalosporins. Cefepime, a fourth-generation cephalosporin, with broader spectrum activity compared to ceftriaxone is a poor inducer of AmpC beta-lactamase, and is poorly hydrolyzed by the enzyme, allowing it to be effective against AmpC-producing organisms. For empiric therapy, cefepime must be combined with metronidazole because it does not possess anti-anaerobic activity.

The newest "5th" generation cephalosporins such as ceftobiprole have very broad-spectrum activity, exhibiting potent in vitro activity against a number of Gram-positive pathogens including MRSA, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Gram-negative pathogens including AmpC producing E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Their role towards E. faecium PBP 5 (PBP 5fm) is controversial. Ceftobiprole medocaril is approved for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia and hospital-acquired pneumonia (excluding ventilator-associated pneumonia), in the European Union. It has not been approved for the treatment of cIAI.

### Impact of a restrictive antibiotic policy on the acquisition of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing enterobacteriaceae in an endemic region: a before-and-after, propensity-matched cohort study in a caribbean intensive care unit [^114JGk8m]. Critical Care (2021). Medium credibility.

Procedures

The 2-year study period was split into two 1-year periods, which differed by the antibiotic policy employed. During the first year, the "conventional strategy period" (CSP), antibiotic therapy was prescribed at the physician's discretion based on national and international guidelines. This strategy included the use of a broad-spectrum antibiotic as initial empirical treatment in the case of sepsis or suspected infection, followed by de-escalation after 48 to 72 h, based on microbiological data. The main regimens were combination therapies with a cephalosporin and aminoglycoside for community-acquired infections, and carbapenem or piperacillin/tazobactam combined with amikacin for hospital-acquired infections. Dosage, timing and duration followed French guidelines.

As part of a stewardship program, a new set of guidelines with a restrictive antibiotic protocol was established by the ICU team, approved by a multidisciplinary team and implemented on 1 January 2015. The "restrictive strategy period" (RSP) was based on seven principles. (1) For suspected infection, microbiological samples were taken immediately, and antibiotic therapy was initiated only after microbiological identification, except for septic shock, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and meningitis. (2) For non-documented septic shock and severe ARDS, an empiric combination therapy including a cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside was immediately started after microbiological sampling according to the ICU protocol. Combined therapy included either second or third cephalosporins (cefuroxime, cefotaxime or ceftriaxone) for community-acquired septic shock, or cefoxitin for hospital-acquired septic shock (owing to the resistance to the previously listed cephalosporins and the high rate of susceptibility to cefoxitin of the ESBL-E) or an anti- Pseudomonas aeruginosa cephalosporin (ceftazidime or cefepime) for late (> 5 days) ventilation-acquired pneumonia (VAP). The second antibiotic was amikacin, unless a Gram-positive pathogen was highly suspected. Due to the low prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in our hospital, the first-line anti-staphylococcal treatment was cefazolin. (3) No use of piperacillin/tazobactam and carbapenems for empirical treatment, only for a documented infection without an alternative option. (4) Limited coverage on P. aeruginosa, unless indicated. (5) Limited coverage on subdiaphragmatic anaerobes, unless indicated. (6) Monotherapy as a definitive treatment. (7) Other characteristics of antibiotic treatment were short duration, high doses and de-escalation as soon as possible to the narrowest alternative, with a focus on penicillin, first- and second-generation cephalosporins, according to the attending physician and following ICU protocols (see detailed protocol in Additional file 1). The local epidemiology of resistant strains according to the unit and origin of samples in 2014–2015 is provided in Table 1: Additional file 1.

### How do I manage difficult-to-treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections? Key questions for today's clinicians [^1124NVi9]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2025). Medium credibility.

Background

Pseudomonas aeruginosa has a remarkable ability to develop resistance to antimicrobials in vivo, often leaving very limited therapeutic options and making treatment particularly challenging. In fact, P. aeruginosa infections with "difficult-to-treat resistance" are one of the most concerning contemporary bacterial infections. Many are hospital-acquired and frequently affect immunocompromised patients with high mortality risk.

Objectives

In the absence of head-to-head clinical trials, we have conducted a narrative review of the current therapeutic options for these infections addressing five key management questions.

Content and Implications

Ceftolozane-tazobactam, ceftazidime-avibactam, imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam and cefiderocol are newer options, but resistance and lack of relevant data from randomised clinical trials hampers knowledge of the best way to use them. Ceftolozane-tazobactam and ceftazidime-avibactam are initially preferred when susceptible because they enter the market first and there is more published evidence about them. Ceftolozane-tazobactam is preferred in P. aeruginosa pneumonia instead of ceftazidime-avibactam. Both can be equally used in other P. aeruginosa infection types. Imipenem-relebactam and cefiderocol may retain susceptibility when there is resistance to ceftolozane-tazobactam and ceftazidime-avibactam, and when metallo-beta-lactamases are not present. However, there are no head-to-head comparative studies to support a preference for one over the other. In the presence of metallo-beta-lactamases, cefiderocol is the preferred agent. Other options in this situation are aztreonam-avibactam, ceftazidime-avibactam combined with aztreonam, and polymyxins combined with meropenem, but evidence is small. In difficult-to-treat P. aeruginosa infections combination therapy could be an option. However, despite demonstrations of in vitro synergy and of enhanced activity in hollow fiber or animal models, there is no clinical evidence to support using combination therapy in these infections and it is not currently recommended as a general option. The role of older antibiotics such as fosfomycin, polymyxin B or colistin, is also reviewed.

RESULTS

On 17 May 2017, the ISIS-AR database contained 170677 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas species, Enterococcus species, and S. aureus from monomicrobial blood cultures. A total number of 116720 (68.4%) fulfilled the criteria of first episode or first recurrent episode of bacteremia and were included in this study. Of a total of 75963 Enterobacteriaceae, results for ceftriaxone/cefotaxime/ceftazidime and imipenem/meropenem could not be interpreted according to EUCAST clinical breakpoints in 4450 (5.9%) and 4585 (6.0%) isolates, respectively, and original susceptibility as reported by the local laboratory was used instead. This also applied to 536 (11.7%) and 498 (10.3%) among 4844 Pseudomonas species isolates for ceftazidime and imipenem/meropenem, respectively, and to 3307 (28.0%) and 2416 (20.4%) among 11824 Enterococcus species isolates for amoxicillin/ampicillin and vancomycin, respectively.

### Complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI): clinical guidelines for treatment and management [^113pxm2L]. IDSA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for acute pyelonephritis, more specifically with respect to empiric antibiotics, community-acquired pyelonephritis, IDSA 2025 guidelines recommend to consider administering a third- or fourth-generation cephalosporin, a carbapenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, or a fluoroquinolone for initial management of patients with sepsis due to complicated UTI, using the four-step assessment, rather than newer agents such as novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors, cefiderocol, plazomicin, or older aminoglycosides.
. Consider administering agents with a broader spectrum of activity against organisms other than Enterobacterales, such as P. aeruginosa, enterococci, or MRSA, for patients with sepsis in whom the diagnosis of complicated UTI is not clear or who are suspected to have complicated UTI due to these pathogens.

### Antibiotic exposure and resistance development in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter species in intensive care units [^116rBpBc]. Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Objectives

We quantified the association between antibiotic exposure and acquisition of antibiotic resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter species in intensive care unit patients.

Design

Prospective cohort study.

Setting and Patients

In 1,201 patients, respiratory tract colonization was determined through regular screening on admission, twice weekly, and on discharge. Primary outcome was the acquisition of antibiotic resistance in previous antibiotic sensitive P. aeruginosa and Enterobacter species, with acquisition attributable to cross-transmission excluded based on genotyping and epidemiologic linkage. Cox regression analysis, adjusted for covariates, was performed to calculate hazard ratios of patients exposed to antibiotics compared to patients not exposed to antibiotics.

Measurements and Main Results

In total, 194 and 171 patients were colonized with P. aeruginosa and Enterobacter species, respectively. Two or more cultures per episode were available for 126 and 108 patients. For P. aeruginosa, ceftazidime exposure was associated with 6.3 acquired antibiotic resistance events per 100 days of exposure, whereas incidence rates were lower for ciprofloxacin, meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam. In multivariate analysis, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, and ceftazidime were significantly associated with risk of resistance development in P. aeruginosa (adjusted hazard ratio, 11.1; 95% confidence interval, 2.4–51.5 for meropenem; adjusted hazard ratio, 4.1; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–16.2 for ciprofloxacin; adjusted hazard ratio, 2.5; 95% confidence interval, 1.1–5.5 for ceftazidime). For Enterobacter, ceftriaxone and ciprofloxacin exposure were associated with most antibiotic resistance acquisitions. No significant associations were found in multivariate analysis.

Conclusions

Meropenem exposure is associated with the highest risk of resistance development in P. aeruginosa. Increasing carbapenem use attributable to emergence of Gram-negative bacteria producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases will enhance antibiotic resistance in P. aeruginosa.

### Antibiotic resistance is common in the cultures of intraabdominal abscess drainage after appendectomy [^115G1mTq]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Introduction

Intraabdominal abscesses (IAA) are a common complication following appendectomy. Empiric antibiotic regimens may fail to prevent IAA due to changes in bacterial resistance. We aim to describe the bacteriology of pediatric patients requiring drainage of an IAA after an appendectomy for appendicitis.

Methods

We performed a retrospective study of patients ≤ 18 years who underwent percutaneous drainage of an IAA following appendectomy a single U.S. children's hospital between 2015 and 2018. Patient demographics, appendicitis characteristics, antibiotic regimens, and culture data were collected.

Results

In total, 71 patients required drainage of an IAA of which 48 (67%) were male, the average age was 9.81 (SD 3.31) years and 68 (95.7%) having complicated appendicitis. Ceftriaxone/metronidazole was the most common empiric regimen prior to IAA drainage occurring in 64 (90.1%) patients. IAA cultures isolated organisms in 34 (47.9%) patients. Of those with positive cultures, 17 (50%) cases demonstrated an antimicrobial resistant organism. Most notably, 20% of Escherichia coli was resistant to the empiric regimen. Empiric antimicrobial regimens did not appropriately cover 92.3% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa cultures or 100% of Enterococcus species cultures. Antimicrobial regimens were changed following IAA drainage in 30 (42.2%) instances with 23 (32.4%) instances due to resistance in culture results or lack of appropriate empiric antimicrobial coverage.

Conclusions

IAA culture data following appendectomy for appendicitis frequently demonstrates resistance to or lack of appropriate coverage by empiric antimicrobial regimens. These data support close review of IAA culture results to identify prevalent resistant pathogens along with local changes in resistance.

Level Of Evidence

Level III.

### Ceftriaxone combination therapy versus respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy for community-acquired pneumonia: a meta-analysis [^1156Tec2]. The American Journal of Emergency Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The goal of this study was to investigate whether ceftriaxone combination therapy is associated with better clinical outcomes than respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy for adults with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). We conducted a meta-analysis of published studies.

Methods

Using the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases, we performed a literature search of available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published as original articles before September 2017.

Results

Nine RCTs, involving 1520 patients, were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled relative risks (RRs) for the efficacy of ceftriaxone combination therapy versus respiratory fluoroquinolones monotherapy were 0.96 (95% CI: 0.92–1.01), based on clinically evaluable populations, and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.88–0.99) based on intention-to-treat (ITT) populations. No statistically significant differences were observed in microbiological treatment success (pooled RR = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.90–1.09), although drug-related adverse events were significantly lower with ceftriaxone combination therapy than with respiratory fluoroquinolones monotherapy (pooled RR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.04–1.55).

Conclusions

Current evidence showed that the efficacy of ceftriaxone combination therapy was similar to respiratory fluoroquinolone monotherapy for hospitalized CAP patients, and was associated with lower drug-related adverse events.

### Single versus combination intravenous anti-pseudomonal antibiotic therapy for people with cystic fibrosis [^115Ydcva]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

The choice of antibiotic, and the use of single or combined therapy are controversial areas in the treatment of respiratory infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa in cystic fibrosis (CF). Advantages of combination therapy include wider range of modes of action, possible synergy and reduction of resistant organisms; advantages of monotherapy include lower cost, ease of administration and reduction of drug-related toxicity. Current evidence does not provide a clear answer and the use of intravenous antibiotic therapy in CF requires further evaluation. This is an update of a previously published review.

Objectives

To assess the effectiveness of single compared to combination intravenous anti-pseudomonal antibiotic therapy for treating people with CF.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register, comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and abstract books of conference proceedings. Most recent search of the Group's Trials Register: 07 October 2020. We also searched online trials registries on 16 November 2020.

Selection Criteria

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing a single intravenous anti-pseudomonal antibiotic with a combination of that antibiotic plus a second anti-pseudomonal antibiotic in people with CF.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We assessed the certainty of the data using GRADE.

Main Results

We identified 59 trials, of which we included eight trials (356 participants) comparing a single anti-pseudomonal agent to a combination of the same antibiotic and one other. There was a wide variation in the individual antibiotics used in each trial. In total, the trials included seven comparisons of a beta-lactam antibiotic (penicillin-related or third generation cephalosporin) with a beta-lactam-aminoglycoside combination and three comparisons of an aminoglycoside with a beta-lactam-aminoglycoside combination. There was considerable heterogeneity amongst these trials, leading to difficulties in performing the review and interpreting the results. These results should be interpreted cautiously. Six of the included trials were published between 1977 and 1988; these were single-centre trials with flaws in the randomisation process and small sample size. Overall, the methodological quality was poor and the certainty of the evidence ranged from low to moderate. The review did not find any differences between monotherapy and combination therapy in either the short term or in the long term for the outcomes of different lung function measures, bacteriological outcome measures, need for additional treatment, adverse effects, quality of life or symptom scores.

Authors' Conclusions

The results of this review are inconclusive. The review raises important methodological issues. There is a need for an RCT which needs to be well-designed in terms of adequate randomisation allocation, blinding, power and long-term follow-up. Results need to be standardised to a consistent method of reporting, in order to validate the pooling of results from multiple trials.

### In vitro activity of cefiderocol against a broad range of clinically important Gram-negative bacteria [^113bbzfD]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2019). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria including Enterobacteriaceae as well as nonfermenters, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, have emerged as significant global clinical threats. Although new agents have recently been approved, none are active across the entire range of resistance mechanisms presented by carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria. Cefiderocol, a novel siderophore cephalosporin, has been shown in large surveillance programs and independent in vitro studies to be highly active against all key gram-negative causative pathogens isolated from patients with hospital-acquired or ventilator-associated pneumonia, bloodstream infections, or complicated urinary tract infections. The improved structure, the novel mode of entry into bacteria, and its stability against carbapenemases enables cefiderocol to exhibit high potency against isolates that produce carbapenemases of all classes or are resistant due to porin channel mutations and/or efflux pump overexpression. Resistance to cefiderocol is uncommon and appears to be multifactorial.

Enterobacterales at moderate risk for clinically significant AmpC production — third-generation cephalosporins and ceftriaxone use: Available data suggest that the emergence of resistance after ceftriaxone exposure occurs in approximately 20% of infections caused by E. cloacae, K. aerogenes, or C. freundii, and the panel suggests generally avoiding third-generation cephalosporins when treating infections caused by these organisms. Based on the mild nature of uncomplicated cystitis and the sufficient urinary excretion of ceftriaxone, ceftriaxone may be adequate therapy for the management of AmpC-E uncomplicated cystitis, and for other relatively uncomplicated infections it may be reasonable to transition to ceftriaxone after clinical improvement has been achieved and if there are no concerns for ongoing sources of infection, weighing the convenience of once-daily ceftriaxone dosing with the potentially increased risk of emergence of resistance.

Pediatric HIV — bacterial pneumonia (S. pneumoniae; occasionally S. aureus, H. influenzae, P. aeruginosa) treatment includes the following regimens: First choice options are amoxicillin 90 mg/kg/dose orally divided every 8 or 12 hours (max 1 g/dose) for outpatient management; ampicillin 200–400 mg/kg/day divided every 6 hours (max 2 g/dose) (use higher dose if S. pneumoniae MIC ≥ 4 mcg/mL); or ceftriaxone 50–100 mg/kg body weight per dose once daily, or 25–50 mg/kg body weight per dose twice daily IV or IM (max 4 g/day). Alternatives are ceftazidime 200–300 mg/kg/day divided every 8 hours IV or IM (max 12 g/day), or cefepime 50 mg/kg/dose every 8 hours IV or IM (max 2 g/dose). Alternative treatment should be determined based on local antimicrobial susceptibility patterns or that of the bacterial isolate, if available. For children who are receiving combination ART, have mild or no immunosuppression, and have mild-to-moderate community-acquired pneumonia, oral therapy option would be amoxicillin 45 mg/kg/dose twice daily (maximum dose: 4 g per day). Add azithromycin for hospitalized patients to treat other common community-acquired pneumonia pathogens (M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae). Add clindamycin or vancomycin if methicillin-resistant S. aureus is suspected (base the choice on local susceptibility patterns). For patients with neutropenia, chronic lung disease other than asthma (e.g. LIP, bronchiectasis) or indwelling venous catheter, consider regimen that includes activity against P. aeruginosa (such as ceftazidime or cefepime instead of ceftriaxone). Consider PCP in patients with severe pneumonia or more advanced HIV disease. Evaluate for tuberculosis, cryptococcosis, and endemic fungi as epidemiology suggests.

DTR Pseudomonas aeruginosa with metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) production — preferred therapy and diagnostic cues specify that for MBL-producing infections the preferred treatment is cefiderocol; DTR isolates resistant to all available β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitors should raise suspicion for MBL production and such isolates generally remain susceptible to cefiderocol; clinical data are limited with seven patients across two cefiderocol trials; ceftazidime-avibactam plus aztreonam appears unlikely to offer meaningful incremental benefit over aztreonam alone, and based on extrapolation ceftazidime-avibactam and aztreonam have activity against < 10% of MBL-producing P. aeruginosa.

### Infectious Diseases Society of America 2023 guidance on the treatment of antimicrobial resistant Gram-Negative infections [^114ENcgQ]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2023). High credibility.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa multidrug-resistant infections — suggested treatment and rationale — When isolates test susceptible to both traditional non-carbapenem β-lactam agents and carbapenems, the former are preferred over carbapenem therapy; for infections caused by isolates not susceptible to any carbapenem but susceptible to traditional β-lactams, administration of a traditional non-carbapenem β-lactam as high-dose extended-infusion therapy is suggested, and for critically ill patients or those with poor source control in this scenario, use of newer β-lactam agents to which P. aeruginosa test susceptible is also a reasonable treatment approach. Phenotypically, isolates not susceptible to a carbapenem agent (eg, meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin MICs ≥ 4 µg/mL) but susceptible to other traditional β-lactams constitute approximately 20% to 60% of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates, and the panel's preferred approach is high-dose extended-infusion therapy (eg, cefepime 2 g IV every 8 hours, infused over at least 3 hours). Patients infected with P. aeruginosa should be closely monitored to ensure clinical improvement given on-therapy resistance risks, exemplified by an analysis of 767 episodes of P. aeruginosa bacteremia showing emergence of resistance within 30 days with the following likelihood: piperacillin-tazobactam (8%), ceftazidime (12%), meropenem (14%), and imipenem (27%).

### Cefepime-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa [^115Bvune]. Emerging Infectious Diseases (2011). Low credibility.

Resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins complicates treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. To elucidate risk factors for cefepime-resistant P. aeruginosa and determine its association with patient death, we conducted a case-control study in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Among 2,529 patients hospitalized during 2001–2006, a total of 213 (8.4%) had cefepime-resistant P. aeruginosa infection. Independent risk factors were prior use of an extended-spectrum cephalosphorin (p < 0.001), prior use of an extended-spectrum penicillin (p = 0.005), prior use of a quinolone (p < 0.001), and transfer from an outside facility (p = 0.01). Among those hospitalized at least 30 days, mortality rates were higher for those with cefepime-resistant than with cefepime-susceptible P. aeruginosa infection (20.2% vs. 13.2%, p = 0.007). Cefepime-resistant P. aeruginosa was an independent risk factor for death only for patients for whom it could be isolated from blood (p = 0.001). Strategies to counter its emergence should focus on optimizing use of antipseudomonal drugs.

### Personalized antibiograms for machine learning driven antibiotic selection [^113h5ij7]. Communications Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Labelling infections for personalized antibiogram models

Using Stanford data we trained 12 binary machine learning models to estimate the probability that common antibiotic selections would provide activity against infections at the point in time empiric antibiotics were chosen. An antibiotic selection was said to provide activity against a patient's infection if all microbial organisms that grew in the patient's microbial cultures were listed as susceptible to at least one of the antibiotics in the selection. While microbial cultures growing Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci sometimes represent true infections warranting antibiotic treatment, we excluded Coagulase-Negative Staphylococci cases as they frequently represent non-infectious contaminants. We trained models for eight commonly administered single antibiotic choices (vancomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, ceftriaxone, cefazolin, ciprofloxacin, ampicillin and meropenem) and four combination therapies (vancomycin + piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin + cefepime, vancomycin + ceftriaxone, and vancomycin + meropenem). We defined our prediction time to be the time at which the first intravenous or intramuscular antibiotic was ordered for the patient following admission to the emergency department. Using Boston data, we similarly trained personalized antibiogram models that predicted whether four antibiotics commonly administered for urinary tract infection (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, nitrofurantoin, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin) would provide activity against the target infection.

Not all antibiotics were tested against all organisms in the microbiology lab which resulted in missing labels for some of our observations. Antibiotics are only tested if they could plausibly be active against a specific organism. We received consultation from the Stanford microbiology lab to generate a set of rules to impute missing labels. For example, our imputation rule assumed that Pseudomonas aeruginosa would be resistant to ceftriaxone and cefazolin; Gram negative rods would be resistant to vancomycin; and Streptococcus agalactiae is susceptible to cephalosporins –. Antibiotic susceptibility was also inferred from observed results of related antibiotics. For example, if an organism was susceptible to a first-generation cephalosporin, it was assumed that it would also be susceptible to a second, third or fourth-generation cephalosporin.

### A phase 3 randomized double-blind comparison of ceftobiprole medocaril versus ceftazidime plus linezolid for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia [^113aJN3A]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2014). Low credibility.

Background

Ceftobiprole, the active moiety of ceftobiprole medocaril, is a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin, with bactericidal activity against a wide range of gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains) and penicillin- and ceftriaxone-resistant pneumococci, and gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Methods

This was a double-blind, randomized, multicenter study of 781 patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), including 210 with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Treatment was intravenous ceftobiprole 500 mg every 8 hours, or ceftazidime 2 g every 8 hours plus linezolid 600 mg every 12 hours; primary outcome was clinical cure at the test-of-cure visit.

Results

Overall cure rates for ceftobiprole vs ceftazidime/linezolid were 49.9% vs 52.8% (intent-to-treat [ITT], 95% confidence interval [CI] for the difference, -10.0 to 4.1) and 69.3% vs 71.3% (clinically evaluable [CE], 95% CI, -10.0 to 6.1). Cure rates in HAP (excluding VAP) patients were 59.6% vs 58.8% (ITT, 95% CI, -7.3 to 8.8), and 77.8% vs 76.2% (CE, 95% CI, -6.9 to 10.0). Cure rates in VAP patients were 23.1% vs 36.8% (ITT, 95% CI, -26.0 to -1.5) and 37.7% vs 55.9% (CE, 95% CI, -36.4 to 0). Microbiological eradication rates in HAP (excluding VAP) patients were, respectively, 62.9% vs 67.5% (microbiologically evaluable [ME], 95% CI, -16.7 to 7.6), and in VAP patients 30.4% vs 50.0% (ME, 95% CI, -38.8 to -0.4). Treatment-related adverse events were comparable for ceftobiprole (24.9%) and ceftazidime/linezolid (25.4%).

Conclusions

Ceftobiprole is a safe and effective bactericidal antibiotic for the empiric treatment of HAP (excluding VAP). Further investigations are needed before recommending the use of ceftobiprole in VAP patients. Clinical Trials Registration. NCT00210964, NCT00229008.

Question 2.2 — Selecting antibiotics for organisms at moderate risk of clinically significant AmpC production: The suggested approach states that several β-lactam antibiotics are at moderate risk of inducing ampC genes and that both induction potential and stability to AmpC β-lactamase hydrolysis should be considered when selecting therapy. The rationale notes a spectrum of induction among β-lactams; aminopenicillins (amoxicillin, ampicillin), narrow-spectrum first-generation cephalosporins, and cephamycins are potent ampC inducers, and both low-risk (S. marcescens) and moderate-risk (E. cloacae) organisms hydrolyze these drugs even at basal ampC expression levels, so such AmpC-E isolates will generally test as resistant. Imipenem is also a potent ampC inducer but generally remains stable to AmpC-E hydrolysis; the induction potential of ertapenem and meropenem has not been formally investigated but, similar to imipenem, they are generally stable to AmpC hydrolysis. Ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, and aztreonam are relatively weak ampC inducers, yet available evidence indicates that their susceptibility to hydrolysis makes them less likely to be effective for infections by organisms at moderate risk for clinically significant AmpC production.

### How good are clinicians in predicting the presence ofspp. in diabetic foot infections? A prospective clinical evaluation [^116d9xLV]. Endocrinology, Diabetes & Metabolism (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Diabetic foot infections (DFIs), including diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO), are common and associated with substantial morbidity, costs and antibiotic use. 1, 2, 3 When clinicians face the choice of selecting an initial empirical antibiotic regimen for most mild and moderate DFIs, 4, 5 one pathogen has exceptional prominence in their judgement: Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 6, 7 This is because they perceive Pseudomonas to be both a common and a highly antibiotic‐resistant pathogen. In fact, microbiological surveys from around the world have shown that it is a frequent isolate from DFIs in subtropical regions (eg South [Eastern] Asia or the Middle East), but far less so in temperate areas (eg North America and Europe). 2, 5 These studies have confirmed that P. aeruginosa is naturally resistant to standard antibiotics 4 most often prescribed for mild and moderate DFIs, 4, 5 such as amino‐penicillins or first‐ and second‐generation cephalosporins. The guidelines on DFI published by both the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) 4 and the International Working Group on the Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) 5 recommend selecting empiric anti‐pseudomonal antibiotic agents only when P. aeruginosa is a documented pathogen, in settings where it has a high prevalence, or an empirical coverage in virulent, acute severe infections such as in sepsis. 5

### Determinants of empirical antipseudomonal antibiotic prescription for adults with pneumonia in the emergency department [^111SZG1t]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2020). Medium credibility.

In the case of the coverage of P aeruginosa, the clinical practice guidelines range substantially, from a non-specific recommendation to a recommendation in critical patients with specific risk factors. In general, and in keeping with our results, overtreatment has been reported in several studies worldwide, reaching nearly 40% of patients in some cases. However, when evaluating severe episodes, the failure to cover P aeruginosa is associated with increased mortality. For instance, in a multicentre study of 529 severely ill CAP admitted to the ICU, despite correct treatment according to IDSA guidelines in 15 (75%) of 20 cases of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, antimicrobial treatment at admission was inadequate. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, malignancy, previous antibiotic exposure, and radiographic findings demonstrating rapid spread of disease were associated with P aeruginosa pneumonia.

Few studies have evaluated aetiology according to severity-of-illness at ED presentation; Cilloniz and colleagues identified Gram-negative enteric bacteria and P aeruginosa as being more frequent in higher-risk groups than in low-risk groups, strengthening the argument that coverage of Gram-negative organisms is needed for these patients. However, in their study, only 5% of patients admitted to a respiratory ICU presented P aeruginosa.

In our study, antipseudomonal coverage was provided in 22/59 of cases admitted to ICU, but in fact none of these patients were infected by P aeruginosa.

In severe episodes of CAP requiring vasopressors or mechanical ventilation, beta-lactam/macrolide combinations were preferred in view of the evidence of reduced mortality due to the immunomodulatory effects of macrolides. Moreover, in agreement with recent recommendations antimicrobial de-escalation is a common practice in the ICU, once the identity of organism has been confirmed by laboratory tests.

### Prevalence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in culture-proven sepsis and outcomes associated with inadequate and broad-spectrum empiric antibiotic use [^115iZ2jx]. JAMA Network Open (2020). High credibility.

Antibiotic Susceptibilities and Adequacy of Therapy

We assessed each potential antibiotic-pathogen combination using antibiotic susceptibilities derived from in vitro reports generated by each institution. Intermediate susceptibilities were treated as nonsusceptible. In some cases, susceptibilities to specific antibiotics administered were not explicitly listed but could be assumed using knowledge of the spectrum of activity for each antibiotic-pathogen combination. For example, many antibiotics are intrinsically inactive against certain species (eg, ceftriaxone vs P aeruginosa) and are therefore not included in susceptibility reports. Alternatively, a gram-negative organism susceptible to ceftriaxone may not have susceptibilities reported to all higher-generation cephalosporins (ie, cefepime), but these agents can be safely used. We created rules to impute susceptibilities for each antibiotic-pathogen combination (eAppendix 2 in the Supplement).

We considered patients to have received inadequate empiric therapy if at least 1 pathogen isolated from any clinical culture site was not susceptible to all antibiotics administered on the first and second day of treatment. We considered patients to have received unnecessarily broad empiric therapy if they received adequate empiric therapy and anti-MRSA antibiotics (ie, vancomycin, linezolid, or daptomycin), anti-VRE antibiotics (ie, linezolid or daptomycin), anti- Pseudomonal β-lactams (ie, ceftazidime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, aztreonam, imipenem, meropenem, or doripenem), or carbapenems (ie, imipenem, meropenem, doripenem, or ertapenem), but none of the organisms targeted by these antibiotics (ie, MRSA, VRE, CTX-RO, or ESBL) were recovered. We did not consider CRE in the analysis of unnecessarily broad therapy given the infrequency of empiric CRE treatment.

Outcomes

We examined associations of both inadequate and unnecessarily broad empiric regimens with in-hospital mortality. The analysis of unnecessarily broad antibiotics was limited to patients who received adequate antibiotics because an empiric regimen would generally not be considered unnecessarily broad if the spectrum was inadequate. Secondary outcomes included hospital-onset acute kidney injury, defined as an increase in creatinine level by at least 0.5 mg/dL (to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1) at any point during hospitalization relative to the initial value on presentation and C difficile infections, which we identified using the ICD - 9 - CM code 008.45 because C difficile test results were unavailable in our data set.

### Antibiotic strategies for eradicating Pseudomonas aeruginosa in people with cystic fibrosis [^111iRMUR]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2023). Medium credibility.

Background

Respiratory tract infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa occur in most people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Established chronic P aeruginosa infection is virtually impossible to eradicate and is associated with increased mortality and morbidity. Early infection may be easier to eradicate. This is an updated review.

Objectives

Does giving antibiotics for P aeruginosa infection in people with CF at the time of new isolation improve clinical outcomes (e.g. mortality, quality of life and morbidity), eradicate P aeruginosa infection, and delay the onset of chronic infection, but without adverse effects, compared to usual treatment or an alternative antibiotic regimen? We also assessed cost-effectiveness.

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group Trials Register comprising references identified from comprehensive electronic database searches and handsearches of relevant journals and conference proceedings. Latest search: 24 March 2022. We searched ongoing trials registries. Latest search: 6 April 2022.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of people with CF, in whom P aeruginosa had recently been isolated from respiratory secretions. We compared combinations of inhaled, oral or intravenous (IV) antibiotics with placebo, usual treatment or other antibiotic combinations. We excluded non-randomised trials and cross-over trials.

Data Collection and Analysis

Two authors independently selected trials, assessed risk of bias and extracted data. We assessed the certainty of the evidence using GRADE.

Main Results

We included 11 trials (1449 participants) lasting between 28 days and 27 months; some had few participants and most had relatively short follow-up periods. Antibiotics in this review are: oral - ciprofloxacin and azithromycin; inhaled - tobramycin nebuliser solution for inhalation (TNS), aztreonam lysine (AZLI) and colistin; IV - ceftazidime and tobramycin. There was generally a low risk of bias from missing data. In most trials it was difficult to blind participants and clinicians to treatment. Two trials were supported by the manufacturers of the antibiotic used. TNS versus placebo TNS may improve eradication; fewer participants were still positive for P aeruginosa at one month (odds ratio (OR) 0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.18; 3 trials, 89 participants; low-certainty evidence) and two months (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.65; 2 trials, 38 participants). We are uncertain whether the odds of a positive culture decrease at 12 months (OR 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.67; 1 trial, 12 participants). TNS (28 days) versus TNS (56 days) One trial (88 participants) comparing 28 days to 56 days TNS treatment found duration of treatment may make little or no difference in time to next isolation (hazard ratio (HR) 0.81, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.76; low-certainty evidence). Cycled TNS versus culture-based TNS One trial (304 children, one to 12 years old) compared cycled TNS to culture-based therapy and also ciprofloxacin to placebo. We found moderate-certainty evidence of an effect favouring cycled TNS therapy (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.82), although the trial publication reported age-adjusted OR and no difference between groups. Ciprofloxacin versus placebo added to cycled and culture-based TNS therapy One trial (296 participants) examined the effect of adding ciprofloxacin versus placebo to cycled and culture-based TNS therapy. There is probably no difference between ciprofloxacin and placebo in eradicating P aeruginosa (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.44; moderate-certainty evidence). Ciprofloxacin and colistin versus TNS We are uncertain whether there is any difference between groups in eradication of P aeruginosa at up to six months (OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.15 to 1.23; 1 trial, 58 participants) or up to 24 months (OR 0.76, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.42; 1 trial, 47 participants); there was a low rate of short-term eradication in both groups. Ciprofloxacin plus colistin versus ciprofloxacin plus TNS One trial (223 participants) found there may be no difference in positive respiratory cultures at 16 months between ciprofloxacin with colistin versus TNS with ciprofloxacin (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.72 to 2.29; low-certainty evidence). TNS plus azithromycin compared to TNS plus oral placebo Adding azithromycin may make no difference to the number of participants eradicating P aeruginosa after a three-month treatment phase (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.35; 1 trial, 91 participants; low-certainty evidence); there was also no evidence of any difference in the time to recurrence. Ciprofloxacin and colistin versus no treatment A single trial only reported one of our planned outcomes; there were no adverse effects in either group. AZLI for 14 days plus placebo for 14 days compared to AZLI for 28 days We are uncertain whether giving 14 or 28 days of AZLI makes any difference to the proportion of participants having a negative respiratory culture at 28 days (mean difference (MD) -7.50, 95% CI -24.80 to 9.80; 1 trial, 139 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Ceftazidime with IV tobramycin compared with ciprofloxacin (both regimens in conjunction with three months colistin) IV ceftazidime with tobramycin compared with ciprofloxacin may make little or no difference to eradication of P aeruginosa at three months, sustained to 15 months, provided that inhaled antibiotics are also used (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.09; P = 0.18; 1 trial, 255 participants; high-certainty evidence). The results do not support using IV antibiotics over oral therapy to eradicate P aeruginosa, based on both eradication rate and financial cost.

Authors' Conclusions

We found that nebulised antibiotics, alone or with oral antibiotics, were better than no treatment for early infection with P aeruginosa. Eradication may be sustained in the short term. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether these antibiotic strategies decrease mortality or morbidity, improve quality of life, or are associated with adverse effects compared to placebo or standard treatment. Four trials comparing two active treatments have failed to show differences in rates of eradication of P aeruginosa. One large trial showed that intravenous ceftazidime with tobramycin is not superior to oral ciprofloxacin when inhaled antibiotics are also used. There is still insufficient evidence to state which antibiotic strategy should be used for the eradication of early P aeruginosa infection in CF, but there is now evidence that intravenous therapy is not superior to oral antibiotics.

Question 1.3 — Infections outside of the urinary tract caused by extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E): A carbapenem is recommended as first-line treatment, and meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin, or ertapenem are preferred; for patients who are critically ill and/or experiencing hypoalbuminemia, meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin are the preferred carbapenems, and after appropriate clinical response is achieved, transitioning to oral TMP-SMX, ciprofloxacin, or levofloxacin should be considered, if susceptibility is demonstrated. The panel suggests the use of meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin, rather than ertapenem, as initial therapy in critically ill patients with ESBL-E infections. Ertapenem offers a more convenient option for outpatient continuation when oral options are not available, and dosing is 1 g every 24 hours. In hypoalbuminemia, an observational study of 279 patients with Enterobacterales infections found that hypoalbuminemia (defined as serum albumin < 2.5 g/dL) was associated with an approximately 5-times higher odds of 30-day mortality for patients receiving ertapenem compared to those receiving meropenem or imipenem-cilastatin. A randomized trial in ceftriaxone non-susceptible E. coli or K. pneumoniae (87% later confirmed to have ESBL genes) compared piperacillin-tazobactam 4.5 g IV every 6 hours with meropenem 1 g IV every 8 hours as standard infusions over 30 minutes, and the primary outcome of 30-day mortality occurred in 12% and 4% of patients receiving piperacillin-tazobactam and meropenem, respectively; trial data were subsequently reanalyzed only including patients with isolates where piperacillin-tazobactam MICs were ≤ 16 μg/mL by broth microdilution.

### The need for new antibiotics [^116XjnmM]. Clinical Microbiology and Infection (2004). Low credibility.

Politicians and public health officials have joined specialist professionals in recognising antibiotic resistance as a threat to modern medicine. Their response has centred on minimising unnecessary antibiotic prescribing, aiming to reduce selection pressure for resistance. Despite a few hopeful trends (e.g., declining penicillin resistance among pneumococci in the UK), established resistance is proving hard to displace; moreover, new resistances continue to emerge and to proliferate at new sites. There consequently remains a strong need for new antibiotics, particularly those directed against multiresistant Gram-negative bacteria in hospitals. Already some nonfermenters of the genera Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas are resistant to all good antibiotics and many Enterobacteriaceae are resistant to all except carbapenems. There is also a growing need for new agents against community-acquired pathogens, including the agents of tuberculosis, gonorrhoea and urinary tract infections. Unless antibacterial development is re-energised, there is a serious risk that a growing proportion of infections, especially in hospitals, will become effectively untreatable.

### Ceftaroline fosamil: a novel broad-spectrum cephalosporin with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [^112VKoUv]. The Annals of Pharmacotherapy (2011). Low credibility.

Objective

To review the pharmacology, microbiology, chemistry, in vitro activity, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety, dosage, and administration of ceftaroline fosamil (Teflaro, Forest Laboratories, Inc.), a novel parenteral broad-spectrum cephalosporin approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on October 29, 2010, for the treatment of adults with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP).

Data Sources

A search of MEDLINE (1966-July 2011) using the search terms ceftaroline fosamil, ceftaroline, TAK-599, PPI-0903, PPI-0903M, and T-91825 was performed. Supplementary sources included program abstracts from the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, American Society of Microbiology, European Congress on Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America from 2005 to 2010, as well as information available from the manufacturer's Web site.

Study Selection and Data Extraction

All English-language articles identified from the data sources were evaluated. In vitro, preclinical, and Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials were included.

Data Synthesis

Clinical trials have been conducted evaluating use of ceftaroline for treatment of ABSSSI and CABP. Safety data from Phase 1, 2, and 3 clinical trials suggest that it is well tolerated and has a safety and tolerability profile common to the cephalosporin class. Ceftaroline has excellent in vitro activity against gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), which makes it an attractive monotherapy for the treatment of ABSSSI. However, it lacks activity against problem gram-negative bacteria (eg, Pseudomonas spp.), which will likely limit its use for serious health care-associated infections. While its role in treating CABP is supported by excellent in vitro activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae and clinical efficacy data, currently available comparators may offer some advantages over ceftaroline. Finally, data are lacking to assess its role in the treatment of serious infections due to MRSA (eg, pneumonia, bacteremia).

Conclusions

These considerations should be part of the formulary review process; however, when considering the significant role MRSA plays in ABSSSI in both the community and hospital settings, we believe that ceftaroline will provide clinicians with a welcome option in addition to currently available anti-MRSA therapies for the treatment of ABSSSI.

### Management of adults with hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia: 2016 clinical practice guidelines by the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society [^112qk15H]. Clinical Infectious Diseases (2016). Medium credibility.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) empiric therapy — Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli coverage emphasizes initial antipseudomonal activity and stratified breadth. For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically, we recommend prescribing antibiotics with activity against P. aeruginosa and other gram-negative bacilli (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence). For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically and have factors increasing the likelihood for Pseudomonas or other gram-negative infection (ie, prior intravenous antibiotic use within 90 days; also see Remarks) or a high risk for mortality, we suggest prescribing antibiotics from 2 different classes with activity against P. aeruginosa (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). All other patients with HAP who are being treated empirically may be prescribed a single antibiotic with activity against P. aeruginosa. For patients with HAP who are being treated empirically, we recommend not using an aminoglycoside as the sole antipseudomonal agent (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). If patient has structural lung disease increasing the risk of gram-negative infection (ie, bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis), 2 antipseudomonal agents are recommended.

### Evaluation of the accelerate pheno system for fast identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing from positive blood cultures in bloodstream infections caused by Gram-Negative pathogens [^116pryNn]. Journal of Clinical Microbiology (2017). Low credibility.

Bloodstream infections (BSI) are an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Increasing rates of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens limit treatment options, prompting an empirical use of broad-range antibiotics. Fast and reliable diagnostic tools are needed to provide adequate therapy in a timely manner and to enable a de-escalation of treatment. The Accelerate Pheno system (Accelerate Diagnostics, USA) is a fully automated test system that performs both identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) directly from positive blood cultures within approximately 7 h. In total, 115 episodes of BSI with Gram-negative bacteria were included in our study and compared to conventional culture-based methods. The Accelerate Pheno system correctly identified 88.7% (102 of 115) of all BSI episodes and 97.1% (102 of 105) of isolates that are covered by the system's identification panel. The Accelerate Pheno system generated an AST result for 91.3% (95 of 104) samples in which the Accelerate Pheno system identified a Gram-negative pathogen. The overall category agreement between the Accelerate Pheno system and culture-based AST was 96.4%, the rates for minor discrepancies 1.4%, major discrepancies 2.3%, and very major discrepancies 1.0%. Of note, ceftriaxone, piperacillin-tazobactam, and carbapenem resistance was correctly detected in blood culture specimens with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (n = 7) and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3) strains. The utilization of the Accelerate Pheno system reduced the time to result for identification by 27.49 h (P < 0.0001) and for AST by 40.39 h (P < 0.0001) compared to culture-based methods in our laboratory setting. In conclusion, the Accelerate Pheno system provided fast, reliable results while significantly improving turnaround time in blood culture diagnostics of Gram-negative BSI.

IDSA 2023 guidance — preferred therapy for pyelonephritis or complicated urinary tract infection (cUTI) caused by DTR Pseudomonas aeruginosa states that ceftolozane-tazobactam, ceftazidime-avibactam, imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam, and cefiderocol are preferred; whenever possible, these agents should be preferentially administered as extended-infusion beta-lactams, with tobramycin or amikacin as alternative agents. Data are insufficient to favor 1 of these agents over the others, and once-daily tobramycin or amikacin are alternative agents for the treatment of P. aeruginosa pyelonephritis or cUTI, although there is a duration-dependent risk of nephrotoxicity.

### Antibacterial susceptibility test interpretive criteria… [^113NFAXK]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

This web page provides information about the in vitro susceptibility of bacteria to certain drugs. The safety and efficacy of these drugs in treating clinical infections due to such bacteria may or may not have been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials and the clinical significance of such susceptibility information in those instances is unknown. The approved product labeling for specific drugs provides the uses for which the product is approved. Labeling for these products can be found at Drugs@FDA or FDA Online Label Repository. Recognized Standards __Performance Methods and Quality Control__ FDA recognizes consensus standards for performance standards, methods standards, and quality control parameter standards including ranges for antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

__Susceptibility Test Interpretive Criteria__ The table below lists antibacterial drugs and indicates which, if any, susceptibility test interpretive criteria, also known as "breakpoints", are recognized or identified by FDA for that drug. Unless specific exceptions and additions are identified in the table, FDA fully recognizes the standards published in: Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing. 35 th ed. CLSI supplement M100; 2025. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Methods for Antimicrobial Dilution and Disk Susceptibility Testing of Infrequently Isolated or Fastidious Bacteria. 3rd ed. CLSI guideline M45; 2015. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Susceptibility Testing of Mycobacteria, Nocardiae and other Aerobic Actinomycetes. 3rd ed. CLSI standard M24; 2018. Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute.
