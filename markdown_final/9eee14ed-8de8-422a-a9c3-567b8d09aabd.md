## Question

A 9-month-old with vaginal bleeding seen in the diaper and the area between the anus and vagina bloody — what is the differential diagnosis and workup?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the differential diagnosis and workup for a 9-month-old with vaginal and perineal bleeding. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about immediate safety and red flags, including the risk of sexual and physical abuse in a non-ambulatory infant. Then, I should develop a prioritized differential that includes both traumatic and medical causes. Next, I will outline immediate stabilization, targeted history, and a comprehensive physical exam with a specialized genital/anal assessment. After that, I need to plan laboratory and imaging workups, including skeletal survey and adjunct studies. I should also address mandatory reporting and multidisciplinary coordination, meticulous documentation and evidence handling, evaluation for medical mimics, and finally disposition and safety planning with attention to bias mitigation and best-practice pathways [^112Luv9Q].

> Let me first confirm the red flag: vaginal bleeding in a 9-month-old is abnormal and demands urgent evaluation, with child safety placed at the forefront because sexual abuse and inflicted trauma rank high on the differential in a precruising infant; at the same time, I must not jump to conclusions and should concurrently consider medical causes while ensuring stabilization and a trauma-informed, unbiased approach [^112Luv9Q] [^111Hz4rz].

> Hold on, I need to construct the differential carefully so I don't miss mimics or rare entities; prioritized concerns include sexual abuse, inflicted genital trauma, and physical abuse with genital involvement, while medical and genitourinary causes to consider include vulvovaginitis, labial adhesions with irritation or bleeding, foreign body insertion, urethral prolapse, vascular malformations or hemangiomas, bleeding diatheses, and very rarely precocious puberty; I should confirm that these possibilities are weighed alongside the historical context and developmental stage, recognizing that most sexually abused children may have normal or nonspecific exams, especially when non-acute, which means diagnosis relies on the synthesis of history, exam, and appropriate testing rather than any single sign [^112Luv9Q] [^1116VpSP] [^115sR3ic].

> I need to check immediate clinical status first: assess airway, breathing, and circulation, evaluate hemodynamic stability, control any active bleeding with gentle local measures, and address pain; framing suspected abuse within a formal trauma-systems approach improves comprehensive assessment and coordination, so I will use that paradigm from the outset while avoiding any delay in resuscitation or stabilization needs [^115EztsZ] [^112Luv9Q].

> Next, I should review the history in a structured, nonjudgmental manner, ideally obtaining caregiver accounts separately and documenting verbatim explanations, timing of bleeding onset, associated symptoms, past medical and birth history, developmental milestones, and family history of bleeding disorders; wait, let me verify the importance of sentinel injuries, because prior seemingly minor injuries in infants often precede severe abuse, and indeed about 27.5% of abused infants had a previous sentinel injury, so I need to actively probe for earlier unexplained bruising or intraoral injuries and ensure those are documented [^116bvczy] [^112Luv9Q].

> I will now examine the infant head-to-toe, because occult injuries often coexist; I should perform a complete skin survey for bruises or burns, inspect the oral cavity for frenulum tears, assess for retinal hemorrhages if clinically indicated, palpate the musculoskeletal system for tenderness or deformities, and perform a targeted neurologic exam; hold on, I should double-check that comprehensive exams and appropriate imaging are recommended even when external findings are subtle, because injury patterns in abused infants frequently include head and skeletal trauma with limited initial external signs [^111Hz4rz] [^111JAteM].

> For the genital and perineal assessment, I should confirm that this is performed by a clinician with specialized training in child sexual abuse evaluation, using magnification and photo-documentation where available, because accurate recognition and interpretation of findings are crucial; I need to check for acute lacerations, bruising, erythema, hymenal injuries, discharge, foreign bodies, anal fissures or laxity, and document any reflex anal dilatation or venous congestion, noting that these latter anal signs have been associated with high likelihood ratios for abuse in case-control data, though I must integrate them carefully with the overall context; but wait, I should also emphasize that most children evaluated for sexual abuse have normal exams, so a normal genital or anal exam does not exclude abuse and should not deter appropriate reporting and protection steps [^117DGsdB] [^114giGkm] [^11646G4L] [^115sR3ic] [^1116VpSP].

> I should confirm the initial laboratory evaluation to include urinalysis and urine culture if urinary symptoms or contamination are possible, as well as a CBC and coagulation studies if a bleeding disorder is plausible; I need to consider STI testing such as nucleic acid amplification tests for gonorrhea and chlamydia if the history or timing suggests exposure, aligning with pediatric sexual abuse testing recommendations, and I should coordinate this with the CSA specialist to preserve forensic integrity and avoid duplicative sampling [^112Luv9Q] [^1116VpSP].

> For imaging, I must not miss the skeletal survey, which is required for all children two years and younger when physical abuse is suspected, and I should plan a repeat skeletal survey in approximately two weeks to detect interval healing of occult fractures; I need to check carefully for classic metaphyseal lesions and posterior rib fractures because these are highly specific for abuse, while remaining mindful that no single fracture pattern is pathognomonic and clinical context matters; additional imaging should be guided by findings, such as neuroimaging if there are neurologic signs or concern for abusive head trauma, and contrast-enhanced abdominal CT if there is suspicion of abdominal injury based on examination or laboratory abnormalities [^115YgGgk] [^112Luv9Q] [^113Eco9V] [^117WhaQs] [^1151zJ2h].

> Now, regarding reporting and team activation, I should confirm that any reasonable suspicion of abuse mandates an immediate report to Child Protective Services, and I should promptly involve a child abuse pediatrician, social work, and, as indicated, law enforcement under institutional and local protocols; I initially thought to universally avoid informing caregivers before reporting, but wait, I should verify local laws and safety considerations first, because while discussing concerns can jeopardize safety or the investigation in some circumstances, norms vary by jurisdiction and institutional policy, so I will prioritize child safety and consult the child protection team on caregiver communication timing [^113PFMXN] [^112Luv9Q] [^115EztsZ] [^111mGxEo].

> I need to ensure meticulous documentation and evidence handling: objective, verbatim recording of caregiver statements, clear anatomic diagrams and high-quality photographs of all injuries, preservation of chain of custody for any forensic samples, and separation of histories obtained from different caregivers; let me double-check the underreporting data to reinforce a low threshold for action, because clinicians frequently do not report even high-suspicion injuries, which underscores why careful documentation and timely reporting are essential to protect the child [^1116VpSP] [^111NWKeD] [^112Luv9Q].

> Next, I should review potential medical mimics so I do not anchor solely on abuse; that includes evaluation for bleeding diatheses such as von Willebrand disease and factor deficiencies, platelet function disorders, and consideration of bone fragility disorders like osteogenesis imperfecta if fractures are identified, recognizing that these are diagnoses of exclusion after a thorough abuse evaluation and correlation with the history and developmental status [^112dbdQc] [^1147kvp6].

> Regarding disposition and safety planning, I should confirm that discharge home is inappropriate when abuse is suspected until CPS completes an initial safety assessment, and admission under a pediatric trauma or surgical service is recommended to coordinate multidisciplinary evaluation and ensure reliable oversight, with visitor restrictions and security measures tailored to safety risks; I need to ensure warm handoffs to child abuse pediatrics, social work, and follow-up services once an immediate safety plan is in place [^115EztsZ] [^111mGxEo].

> But wait, I should also explicitly address equity and bias; I need to ensure the evaluation follows standardized clinical pathways, engages consultation early, and includes staff education on bias mitigation, because disparities in abuse evaluations and reporting have been documented, and reducing unnecessary tests while not missing occult injuries depends on consistent, protocolized care embedded within trauma systems [^112WQwJ6] [^112Luv9Q].

> Final check: a 9-month-old with vaginal and perineal bleeding warrants immediate stabilization, parallel consideration of sexual and physical abuse with a low threshold for mandatory reporting, specialized genital/anal examination with careful documentation, age-appropriate laboratory testing, a mandatory skeletal survey with repeat imaging and adjunct neuroabdominal imaging as indicated, multidisciplinary coordination led by child abuse pediatrics and trauma services, thoughtful consideration of medical mimics only after abuse evaluation, and hospital admission until safety is assured; I should reiterate that a normal anogenital exam does not exclude abuse and that structured, trauma-informed, unbiased care is essential to protect the child while ensuring diagnostic accuracy [^112Luv9Q] [^115YgGgk] [^1116VpSP] [^115sR3ic] [^115EztsZ] [^111mGxEo].

In a 9-month-old with vaginal bleeding and blood between the anus and vagina, the differential includes **sexual abuse** [^115sR3ic], **anal fissures**, **vulvovaginitis**, **urethral prolapse**, **foreign body**, and **bleeding disorders**. Immediate evaluation should include a focused **history**, thorough **anogenital exam** [^112Luv9Q], and prompt reporting to **child protective services** if abuse is suspected [^113PFMXN]. Obtain a **skeletal survey** [^115YgGgk], head CT/MRI if neurologic symptoms [^111Hz4rz], and abdominal imaging if intra-abdominal injury is suspected [^1151zJ2h]. Perform CBC, PT/PTT, and STI testing as indicated. Management is **multidisciplinary** [^115EztsZ], with admission for suspected abuse or significant injury [^111mGxEo], and urgent surgical or gynecologic consultation for active bleeding or foreign body.

---

## Differential diagnosis

### Trauma-related causes

- **Sexual abuse**: Highly concerning in this age group; consider if injuries are unexplained or inconsistent with history [^115sR3ic].

- **Anal fissures**: Common in infants due to constipation or trauma.

- **Accidental trauma**: Rare in non-ambulatory infants; requires careful assessment of plausibility [^116bvczy].

---

### Non-traumatic causes

- **Vulvovaginitis**: Inflammation from poor hygiene, irritants, or infection [^1116VpSP].

- **Urethral prolapse**: Circular, friable mucosa protruding from the urethra, causing bleeding.

- **Foreign body**: Objects inserted into the vagina or anus causing mucosal injury [^111Hz4rz].

- **Bleeding disorders**: Hemophilia, von Willebrand disease, or platelet disorders.

---

## Clinical evaluation

### History

Characterize the **onset and duration** of bleeding and any associated symptoms. Assess for **recent trauma** (accidental or non-accidental); review medical history for bleeding disorders, constipation, and infections; and elicit family and social history to identify risk factors for abuse or neglect [^111Hz4rz].

---

### Physical examination

Evaluate general appearance, including **vital signs**, pallor, and distress. Perform a detailed **anogenital exam** to assess for lacerations, bruising, fissures, foreign bodies, or prolapse, and complete a full-body exam for other injuries, including additional bruising [^114jQ57z].

---

## Diagnostic workup

### Laboratory tests

Obtain a **CBC** to assess for anemia or thrombocytopenia. Order **coagulation studies** (PT, aPTT) to evaluate for bleeding disorders, and perform **STI testing** (gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomonas, HSV) if abuse is suspected.

---

### Imaging studies

Obtain a skeletal survey in all infants with suspected abuse [^115YgGgk]. Perform **head CT/MRI** for neurologic symptoms or concern for head injury [^111Hz4rz], and obtain **abdominal imaging** if intra-abdominal injury is suspected [^1151zJ2h].

---

## Management and reporting

- **Immediate management**: Stabilize, control bleeding, treat infections [^115EztsZ].

- **Reporting**: Mandated reporting to child protective services if abuse suspected [^113PFMXN].

- **Multidisciplinary approach**: Involve pediatricians, social workers, child abuse specialists, and law enforcement [^111mGxEo] [^112Luv9Q].

- **Admission**: For suspected abuse, significant injury, or unstable patients [^111mGxEo].

---

## Follow-up care

Arrange medical **follow-up** to monitor healing and complications, and provide **psychological support** and counseling for the child and family [^115sR3ic]. Deliver **preventive education** to address risk factors and prevent recurrence [^1147Zwyj].

---

Vaginal bleeding in a 9-month-old is rare and requires a **thorough evaluation** [^111Hz4rz] to rule out abuse, trauma, infection, and bleeding disorders. A structured approach with history, exam, labs, imaging, and mandated reporting ensures accurate diagnosis and child safety.

Visceral injuries as a result of physical child abuse are uncommon and may be difficult to identify clinically; nevertheless, they constitute a significant cause of mortality and morbidity in affected children. Any organ can be involved, but hepatic and bowel injuries are the most common, while injuries to solid and hollow organs are equally common. Abusive abdominal injuries are mostly seen in toddlers, whereas accidental abdominal injuries are more prevalent in older children. When abusive abdominal injury is suspected, the recommended radiological imaging modality is contrast-enhanced abdominal and pelvic CT, as it is in cases of suspected accidental abdominal injury.

### Child abuse: Approach and management [^114p3hiD]. American Family Physician (2022). High credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on child abuse:

- **Definition**: Child abuse is a violation of human rights, defined as an act, or failure to act, on the part of a parent, guardian, and/or caregiver that results in the death, serious physical or emotional harm, sexual abuse, or exploitation of a child, or which places the child in an imminent risk of serious harm and/or seriously impacts the child's long-term development and potential.

- **Pathophysiology**: Child maltreatment encompasses physical, sexual (including sex trafficking), and emotional/psychological abuse and neglect.

- **Epidemiology**: Approximately 4.4 million children are reported to Child Protective Services each year, with about 9 out of 1,000 children in the US found to have evidence of maltreatment after investigation, and 9.2% of victimized children experiencing sexual assault. The global prevalence of self-reported child physical abuse is estimated to range from 7% to 19%.

- **Risk factors**:
	- **Child factors**: Chronic illness, emotional or behavioral difficulties, physical disabilities, preterm birth, unplanned or unwanted pregnancy
	- **Caregiver factors**: Young parental age, criminal history, alcohol or substance abuse, depression or other mental health issues, poor impulse control, history of abuse, unrealistic expectations for the child, poor knowledge of the child, negative perception of normal childhood behavior, low educational attainment, low self-esteem
	- **Home environment**: Family or intimate partner violence, non-biologically related adult living in the home

### The radiographic approach to child abuse [^113Eco9V]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Whether mental or physical, trauma is central to all cases of child abuse. Much of that trauma results in musculoskeletal injuries, which places the orthopaedic surgeon in a primary position in the recognition and treatment of these injuries. In most patients, radiographic imaging plays a major role in diagnosis. Some injuries are typically produced as a result of excessive and inappropriate force on the tender skeleton of a child. These injuries are characteristic of child abuse and include the classic metaphyseal lesion (CML) and posteromedial rib fractures. Other injuries, which are in themselves nonspecific in terms of their causation, become highly suspicious when the history provided by the caretakers is inconsistent with the type of injury produced. A toddler's fracture of the tibia in an infant who is not yet ambulatory and therefore not "toddling" would be such an injury. Another example of such a history-injury discordance is a complex skull fracture in an infant who sustained a fall from a bed.

The most important and frequently utilized system of fracture classification as it relates to abuse was detailed by Dr. Paul Kleinman and separates various fractures into broad categories of high, moderate, and low specificity for the ultimate diagnosis of child abuse.

In this article, I will detail the radiographic imaging of the more characteristic highly specific injuries and discuss the major issues that relate to some moderate- or low-specificity injuries. In addition, I will discuss several mimics of abuse with which the orthopaedic surgeon should be familiar.

Pediatricians and other health care providers can play several important roles in the prevention of child maltreatment. This article aims to help pediatricians incorporate child abuse prevention into their practice. Resources for systematizing anticipatory guidance and screening for risk factors in child maltreatment are described. The modalities, strengths, and weaknesses of community-based prevention programs are discussed, and tools with which providers can identify the effectiveness of available community-based programs are offered. On a broader level, ways whereby pediatricians can advocate at the local, state, and national levels for policies and programs that support families and children are described.

### From suspicion of physical child abuse to reporting: Primary care clinician decision-making [^111NWKeD]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

The goals were to determine how frequently primary care clinicians reported suspected physical child abuse, the levels of suspicion associated with reporting, and what factors influenced reporting to child protective services.

In this prospective observational study, 434 clinicians collected data on 15,003 child injury visits, including information about the injury, child, family, likelihood that the injury was caused by child abuse (5-point scale), and whether the injury was reported to child protective services. Data on 327 clinicians indicating some suspicion of child abuse for 1,683 injuries were analyzed.

Clinicians reported 95 (6%) of the 1,683 patients to child protective services. Clinicians did not report 27% of injuries considered likely or very likely caused by child abuse and 76% of injuries considered possibly caused by child abuse. Reporting rates were increased if the clinician perceived the injury to be inconsistent with the history and if the patient was referred to the clinician for suspected child abuse. Patients who had an injury that was not a laceration, who had more than one family risk factor, who had a serious injury, who had a child risk factor other than an inconsistent injury, who were Black, or who were unfamiliar to the clinician were more likely to be reported. Clinicians who had not reported all suspicious injuries during their career or who had lost families as patients because of previous reports were more likely to report suspicious injuries.

Clinicians had some degree of suspicion that approximately 10% of injuries were caused by child abuse.

### The intersection of medical child abuse and medical complexity [^111W6QMT]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2017). Low credibility.

Children with medical complexity and victims of medical child abuse may exhibit similar clinical presentations. Atypical or unexplained signs and symptoms, often due to rare diseases, may lead providers to suspect medical child abuse when it is not present. Conversely, medical child abuse may either cause or coexist with medical complexity. Careful consideration of the presence of medical child abuse is essential when assessing a child with medical complexity, as either diagnosis has significant consequences for children and families.

### Identifying risk factors of children who suffered physical abuse: A systematic review [^1137UTxx]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons: Global Research & Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

For clinical signs associated with physical child abuse, head injuries were the most cited clinical indication, referenced by 16 articles. This finding is consistent with other systematic reviews, which have found that abusive head trauma (AHT) is the most common cause of traumatic death in abused children. Intracranial injury or hematoma was commonly cited and was mentioned in six articles. However, it was only found to be a significant clinical indication in three of the six articles. A systematic review by Piteau et al. mentions that it is important to specify the type of intracranial injury because the mechanism of injury is critical for a preliminary determination. Because many articles use the term intracranial injury broadly, this could explain the divide among the significance of intracranial injuries as a clinical indication for physical child abuse. Unlike intracranial injuries, subdural hematoma or hemorrhage was found to be notable in all four articles that cited it. This is consistent with the systematic review by Piteau et al, which found subdural hemorrhage to be the most reported clinical indication of physical child abuse. These findings may be explained by the inherent severity of head injuries. Therefore, abusive head injuries may be more likely to result in an emergency department visit than other, less severe physical abuse injuries.

### Anal signs of child sexual abuse: A case-control study [^11646G4L]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

Child sexual abuse (CSA) diagnosis has been likened to a "jigsaw puzzle". Whilst the child's allegation is vital, physical evidence obtained by an appropriately qualified examiner can support criminal prosecution and child protection. Physical evidence has been the subject of consensus statements and systematic reviews.

- **Anal findings**: Anal findings are described following CSA, in children selected for non-abuse, and those with medical conditions affecting the anus. There have been two previous studies where anal signs in different groups of children were compared.

- **Court proceedings**: If present, anal signs may be used in children with a disclosure of CSA to provide corroboration for court proceedings, but it is not currently clear how much reliance can be placed on which signs.

- **Extent of concern**: There is even less certainty about the extent to which anal signs seen in children with no disclosure or suspicion should raise concern about possible CSA and the need for further investigation.

This study aimed to compare the prevalence of anal findings as assessed by specialist forensically trained paediatricians in a group of children where the history included a statement by the child of anal abuse with a group of children with a history solely of non-sexual physical abuse or neglect and with no concerns regarding sexual abuse.

### Is early detection of abused children possible? A systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of the identification of abused children [^114bxbNr]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

**Conclusions**: There is very scarce and low-quality evidence on the accuracy of instruments for identifying abused children. Child maltreatment is mostly identified when children have already experienced serious consequences, and the sensitivities and specificities of these tools are inadequate. Before considering a screening program for child maltreatment, better knowledge about the onset of child maltreatment and the development of valid screening instruments at subclinical stages remain necessary.

### Facilitators and barriers to screening for child abuse in the emergency department [^114rhG9z]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

To identify facilitators and barriers to screening for child abuse in emergency departments (ED), interviews were conducted with ED staff, members of the hospital board, and related experts.

- **Methods**: This qualitative study is based on semi-structured interviews with 27 professionals from seven Dutch hospitals, including seven pediatricians, two surgeons, six ED nurses, six ED managers, and six hospital board members. The resulting list of facilitators and barriers was subsequently discussed with five experts in child abuse and one implementation expert. The results are ordered using the Child Abuse Framework of the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate, which legally requires screening for child abuse.

- **Results**: A lack of knowledge about child abuse, communication challenges with parents in cases of suspected abuse, and insufficient time for policy development and case handling are barriers for ED staff in screening for child abuse. For board members, the lack of resources and time, along with high turnover of ED staff, are impediments to improving child abuse policy. Screening can be promoted by training ED staff to better recognize child abuse, improving communication skills, appointing an attendant specifically for child abuse, explicitly supporting the screening policy by management, and implementing a national approved protocol with a validated screening instrument.

- **Conclusions**: ED staff are motivated to adhere to the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate requirements but face many barriers, particularly in communication with parents of children suspected of being abused. Introduction of a national c

### Effective components of school-based prevention programs for child abuse: A meta-analytic review [^115J8Two]. Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review (2021). Low credibility.

To be included in the meta-analysis, primary studies had to meet specific inclusion criteria. Studies needed to report on the effect of at least one school-based child abuse prevention program on child abuse-related knowledge and/or self-protection skills of children. School-based prevention programs are defined as programs implemented by an instructor (e.g. teacher, school nurse, external instructor) in a school setting, aimed at preventing child abuse by providing children with knowledge and self-protection skills that decrease a child's risk for abuse.

The concept of child abuse followed the definition formulated by the World Health Organization: "child abuse or maltreatment constitutes of all forms of physical and/or emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect or negligent treatment or commercial or other exploitation, resulting in actual or potential harm to the child's health, survival, development or dignity in the context of a relationship of responsibility, trust or power" (World Health Organization). Following this definition, studies that reported on any form of child abuse (i.e. physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and any form of neglect) committed by parents, caregivers, or other adults or individuals with whom there is a relationship of responsibility, trust, or power were included. Studies reporting on extrafamilial child (sexual) abuse were also included in this meta-analysis. As for child abuse-related knowledge, studies had to measure knowledge on these topics.

### More than words: The emotional maltreatment of children [^113g3yWH]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2014). Low credibility.

Emotional maltreatment may be the most complex, prevalent, and damaging form of child maltreatment and can occur simultaneously with other forms of abuse. Children in the first few years of life seem to be at the greatest risk of suffering the most negative outcomes. Medical professionals can help identify and protect victims of emotional maltreatment by carefully observing caregiver-child interactions, paying attention to a family's social history, making referrals to community or counseling programs when necessary, and reporting any suspicions of maltreatment to Child Protective Services. A well-coordinated, multidisciplinary response must be enacted whenever emotional maltreatment is suspected or reported.

### Orthopedic manifestations of child abuse [^111fkseJ]. Pediatric Research (2022). High credibility.

Child abuse is common in the United States but is often undetected. The incidence of this form of abuse is difficult to quantify, yet children with a history of abuse are at risk of chronic health conditions. Medical providers are in the unique position of triaging trauma patients and differentiating between unintentional and abusive trauma, as well as serving as mandated reporters of abuse in all states. Obtaining a detailed history and screening for risk factors can help identify children at risk of abuse.

Certain orthopedic injuries may be related to abuse, triggering clinical suspicion and leading to further workup or intervention. By increasing awareness through medical provider education and enhanced screening, earlier detection of abuse may prevent more serious injuries and consequences.

This review evaluates literature regarding the orthopedic manifestations of child abuse in hopes of increasing medical provider awareness. The impact is significant: child abuse often remains undetected in the United States. Medical professionals have a unique opportunity to evaluate trauma patients and identify concerns for abusive injuries. Certain orthopedic injuries may raise concern for abuse, prompting clinical suspicion and further assessment or intervention.

### Facilitators and barriers to screening for child abuse in the emergency department [^1135avK7]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

- **Child abuse team and attendant collaboration**: Three of the seven hospitals had a child abuse team focused on policy and/or cases. Organizing a team meeting was challenging because it was difficult to meet during working hours, and people were not willing to meet after work. Five board members found the appointment of a child abuse attendant useful, but there was no money available, or it was considered part of the normal social work package. One board member was not in favor of creating functions with special areas, as they believed the primary person, such as an ED nurse, would no longer feel responsible. Health professionals were satisfied with the collaboration with the Child Abuse Center.

- **Protocol for suspected child abuse**: All physicians stated that their hospital had a protocol for suspected child abuse. However, not all other interviewees were aware of it or knew where to find the protocol. At the time of the interviews, screening for child abuse by completing a SPUTOVAMO form (or a checklist derived from SPUTOVAMO) was conducted in five of the seven participating hospitals. Two hospitals did not screen for child abuse due to disagreements about its usefulness or about which profession should complete the screening instrument. Regardless of whether screening took place, the majority believed that child abuse is not always detected in the ED. ED managers agreed that screening belongs to the work of the ED; however, during busy hours, ED nurses often disregard the checklist, even though it can play a crucial role in detecting abuse.

### Child abuse: Approach and management [^111Uz536]. American Family Physician (2007). Low credibility.

Child abuse is a common diagnosis in the United States and should be considered any time neglect or emotional, physical, or sexual abuse is a possibility. Although home visitation programs have been effective in preventing child maltreatment, much of the approach to and management of child abuse is directed by expert opinion or legal mandate. Any suspicion of abuse must be reported to Child Protective Services. A multidisciplinary approach is recommended to adequately evaluate and treat child abuse victims; however, the responsibility often lies with the family physician to recognize and treat these cases at first presentation to prevent significant morbidity and mortality.

### Nonaccidental trauma: Clinical aspects and epidemiology of child abuse [^116Y7gWv]. Pediatric Radiology (2009). Low credibility.

Radiologists play a key role in the recognition of child abuse. In the last century, radiologists pioneered the identification of nonaccidental injuries, including fractures and brain injury, and, together with colleagues in pediatrics, advocated for the protection of children from abuse. Prevalence studies in many countries have revealed the widespread and hidden nature of child maltreatment. New and complex forms of abuse, such as fabricated or induced illness, have been recognized. Physical abuse affects 7–9% of children in the UK, although fewer suffer the severe or life-threatening injuries often seen by radiologists.

A high index of suspicion of nonaccidental trauma is required where known patterns of injury or inconsistencies of presentation and history are detected. In many cases, the diagnosis is readily made, although some cases remain contentious or controversial and consume much clinical time and energy. Differences of view between doctors are tested in the courts. Adverse publicity has made this work unpopular in the UK. Knowledge of the differential diagnosis of unexplained or apparent injury is essential for accurate diagnosis, which is vital where errors in either direction can be disastrous. New UK radiological guidelines will assist radiologists in achieving best evidence-based practice.

### Clinicians' description of factors influencing their reporting of suspected child abuse: Report of the Child Abuse Reporting Experience Study Research Group [^113uQPMz]. Pediatrics (2008). Low credibility.

Primary care clinicians participating in the Child Abuse Reporting Experience Study did not report all suspected physical child abuse to child protective services. This evaluation of study data seeks:

- **Objectives**: (1) To identify factors clinicians weighed when deciding whether to report injuries they suspected might have been caused by child abuse; (2) to describe clinicians' management strategies for children with injuries from suspected child abuse that were not reported; and (3) to describe how clinicians explained not reporting high-suspicion injuries.

- **Methods**: From the 434 pediatric primary care clinicians who participated in the Child Abuse Reporting Experience Study and who indicated they had provided care for a child with an injury they perceived as suspicious, a subsample of 75 out of 81 clinicians completed a telephone interview. Interviewees included 36 clinicians who suspected child abuse but did not report the injury to child protective services (12 with high suspicion and 24 with some suspicion) and 39 who reported the suspicious injury. Interviews were analyzed for major themes and subthemes, including decision-making regarding reporting of suspected physical child abuse to child protective services and alternative management strategies.

- **Results**: Four major themes emerged regarding the clinicians' reporting decisions: familiarity with the family, reference to elements of the case history, use of available resources, and perception of expected outcomes of reporting to child protective services. When they did not report, clinicians planned alternative management strategies for the child.

### Imaging and reporting considerations for suspected physical abuse (non-accidental injury) in infants and young children. Part 1: Initial considerations and appendicular skeleton [^114jQ57z]. Clinical Radiology (2017). Low credibility.

Recognising the skeletal manifestations of inflicted injury (II) in infants and young children is of crucial importance. There are specific fracture patterns which are highly suspicious of II, in addition to common differential diagnoses with which radiologists should be familiar. Our objective is to provide a non-exhaustive review of the important factors relevant to the imaging and reporting of II as a platform for further learning. Part 1 encompasses important initial considerations and fracture patterns of the appendicular skeleton.

### Facilitators and barriers to screening for child abuse in the emergency department [^112ZBVu7]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Since January 2009, Dutch hospitals are legally required to fulfill the criteria of the Child Abuse Framework of the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate. Most hospitals in the present study met most of these criteria. In general, this compliance was promoted by a supportive board, the presence of a child abuse attendant, a protocol for suspected child abuse, or an appropriate screening instrument. However, many barriers to adequate detection of child abuse in emergency departments (EDs) still exist. More time, money, and effort from health professionals and management are needed to tackle these barriers. Previous studies have shown that screening for child abuse in emergency departments is effective for increasing the detection of suspected child abuse, but a validated protocol or screening instrument is lacking.

Health professionals are motivated to improve the detection of child abuse but lack sufficient time to develop adequate policy and protocols, register suspicions of child abuse, and organize education and training. Moreover, the ED's high patient flow, with its great diversity in severity of symptoms, makes it hard for ED staff to calmly discuss a suspicion of child abuse with parents. The appointment of a dedicated child abuse attendant who can perform all these tasks could be a solution. Unfortunately, not all hospital directors, whose support is needed to create such a function, are convinced of this necessity. The Inspectorate sees the appointment of a child abuse attendant as a condition of delivering responsible care.

### PedHITSS: A screening tool to detect childhood abuse in clinical settings [^1119Sg3Q]. Family Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

The prevalence and detrimental effects of child abuse are well-documented; however, healthcare providers often do not screen for abuse sufficiently to detect or prevent such events. Existing child abuse screening tools are frequently criticized for their lack of brevity and effectiveness in clinical settings. The Pediatric Hurt-Insult-Threaten-Scream-Sex (PedHITSS) screening tool, a concise 5-item questionnaire, was developed to detect and encourage provider investigation into child abuse in clinical environments. This study compares PedHITSS to the Conflict Tactics Scale: Parent-Child Version (CTSPC) screening measure.

- **Methods**: Participants included 422 pediatric patients, with 242 identified as nonabused and 180 as part of an abused subsample. These participants were recruited from an ambulatory care setting, a medical center at-risk referral clinic, or a homeless shelter clinic. Parents completed a cross-sectional survey incorporating both the PedHITSS and CTSPC questionnaires. The conValidity of PedHITSS was tested with 242 nonabused participants, and construct validity was assessed using 180 individuals previously identified as victims of child abuse.

- **Results**: There was strong conValidity between the CTSPC and PedHITSS, with a correlation of rs = .70 (P < .01). The sensitivity and specificity for accurately identifying abuse victims (aged 12 years or younger) were optimal at a cut point of one or greater. No significant differences were found in the sensitivity and specificity between HITSS and CTSPC in correctly identifying child abuse victims.

- **Conclusions**: The findings suggest that PedHITSS is as effective as the CTSPC in identifying and distinguishing victims from nonvictims of child abuse. The PedHITSS tool provides a practical option for healthcare professionals to screen for child abuse.

### Sentinel injuries in infants evaluated for child physical abuse [^116bvczy]. Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Relatively minor abusive injuries can precede severe physical abuse in infants. Our objective was to determine how often abused infants have a previous history of "sentinel" injuries, compared with infants who were not abused.

- **Methods**: Case-control, retrospective study of 401 infants under 12 months old evaluated for abuse in a hospital-based setting. After being evaluated by the hospital-based Child Protection Team, infants were categorized with definite, intermediate concern for, or no abuse. A sentinel injury was defined as a previous injury reported in the medical history that was suspicious for abuse because the infant could not cruise, or the explanation was implausible.

- **Results**: Of the 200 definitely abused infants, 27.5% had a previous sentinel injury compared with 8% of the 100 infants with intermediate concern for abuse (odds ratio: 4.4, 95% confidence interval: 2.0–9.6; P < .001). None of the 101 nonabused infants (controls) had a previous sentinel injury (P < .001). The type of sentinel injury in the definitely abused cohort was bruising (80%), intraoral injury (11%), and other injury (7%). Sentinel injuries occurred in early infancy: 66% at less than 3 months of age and 95% at or before the age of 7 months. Medical providers were reportedly aware of the sentinel injury in 41.9% of cases.

- **Conclusions**: Previous sentinel injuries are common in infants with severe physical abuse and rare in infants evaluated for abuse and found to not be abused. Detection of sentinel injuries with appropriate interventions could prevent many cases of abuse.

### Patterns of skeletal fractures in child abuse: Systematic review [^1147mEvP]. BMJ (2008). Low credibility.

Objectives: To systematically review published studies to identify characteristics that distinguish fractures in children resulting from abuse from those not resulting from abuse, and to calculate a probability of abuse for individual fracture types.

Design: Systematic review.

Data sources: An all-language literature search included the following databases for original study articles, references, textbooks, and conference abstracts until May 2007:

- **Medical and health science databases**: Medline, Medline in Process, Embase, CINAHL
- **Social science and care databases**: Assia, Caredata, Child Data, Social Science Citation Index, Social Care Online
- **Citation and abstract databases**: ISI Proceedings, Sciences Citation, SIGLE, Scopus, TRIP

Study selection: Comparative studies of fracture at different bony sites, sustained in physical abuse and from other causes in children under 18 years old, were included. Review articles, expert opinions, postmortem studies, and studies in adults were excluded.

Data extraction and synthesis: Each study had two independent reviews (three if disputed) by specialist reviewers, including pediatricians, pediatric radiologists, orthopedic surgeons, and nurses specialized in child protection. Each study was critically appraised using data extraction sheets, critical appraisal forms, and evidence sheets based on NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination guidance. Meta-analysis was conducted where possible, with a random effects model fitted to account for the heterogeneity between studies.

Results: In total, 32 studies were included. Fractures resulting from abuse were recorded throughout the skeletal system, most commonly in infants (under 1 year old) and toddlers (between 1 and 3 years old). Multiple fractures were frequently observed in these cases.

### Facilitators and barriers to screening for child abuse in the emergency department [^112NMjH6]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

Five child abuse experts were interviewed, and we also sought advice from an implementation expert on how to implement a screening protocol for child abuse in emergency departments (EDs).

- **Policy**: To ensure funding for the policy to tackle child abuse, two experts advised adjusting the DBC code (Diagnostic/Treatment code in the Dutch medico-financial system) for child abuse. This adjustment would allow hospitals to receive the necessary funding for this type of care.

- **Child abuse team, child abuse attendant, and collaboration with the Child Abuse Center**: The experts emphasized the necessity of child abuse teams for effective collaboration across various disciplines. Two experts recommended evaluating the policy twice a year with the complete team, while advising that specific cases be reviewed only with the involved professionals. Four experts advocated for investing in and appointing an attendant specifically for child abuse due to the substantial time and effort involved in psychosocial research and referral to child care. A child abuse attendant can ensure quality control, expedite treatment or referrals, and uphold proper follow-up of patients.

- **Protocol for suspected child abuse**: The introduction of a national protocol, with local modifications, was supported by the experts to ensure uniformity in the process and prevent each hospital from developing its own protocol.

All experts agreed that screening for child abuse in EDs is worthwhile, with a head-to-toe examination being an essential component as it can reveal important signs of child abuse.

### The radiographic approach to child abuse [^114bYnRW]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Osseous injuries are a major facet of child abuse, and in most patients, radiographic imaging plays a significant role in diagnosis. While some injuries typically result from excessive and inappropriate force, other injuries are nonspecific in terms of their causation but become suspicious when the history provided by the caretakers is inconsistent with the type of injury produced.

- **Questions/purposes**: The radiographic imaging of highly specific injuries is detailed, major issues related to some moderate- or low-specificity injuries are discussed, and several diseases that mimic abuse are described.

- **Methods**: A review of the recent literature focused on the radiographic imaging of child abuse was performed by searching the National Library of Medicine database at pubmed.gov. Keywords used included "radiology", "fracture", "child abuse", and/or "nonaccidental trauma".

- **Results**: Injuries highly specific for the diagnosis of abuse include metaphyseal corner fractures, posteromedial rib fractures, and sternal, scapular, and spinous process fractures. Lesions of moderate specificity include, among others, multiple fractures of various ages and epiphyseal separations. Long-bone fractures and clavicular fractures, while common, are of low specificity. In addition to accurate diagnosis of these injuries, several diseases and syndromes may mimic abuse due to the similarity in the radiographic picture.

- **Conclusions**: Stratification of fractures sustained in child abuse according to specificity and an understanding of radiological indicators are critical in distinguishing between abusive and non-abusive causes.

### Medical child abuse: Clinicians as healers, abusers, and expert witnesses [^116JEiLr]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2025). Low credibility.

Medical child abuse (MCA) occurs when a caregiver falsifies signs and symptoms, resulting in a child receiving unnecessary and harmful or potentially harmful medical care. Like other conditions, MCA can be diagnosed using traditional diagnostic methods. MCA carries a significant risk of morbidity and mortality. Collaboration between clinicians, and when necessary, between clinicians and Child Protective Services, increases the likelihood of diagnosis and successful management.

### Child abuse and the pediatric surgeon: A position statement from the Trauma Committee, the Board of Governors and the Membership of the American Pediatric Surgical Association [^115EztsZ]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2019). Low credibility.

The pediatric surgeon plays a crucial role in assessing, stabilizing, and managing victims of child physical abuse — once referred to as nonaccidental trauma — within a formal trauma system setting.

- **Methods**: The American Pediatric Surgical Association (APSA) endorses viewing child physical abuse as a traumatic disease. This perspective justifies using trauma system resources to properly evaluate and manage affected patients, including intervention by pediatric surgeons.

- **Results**: APSA recommends that a standardized tool be used to screen for child physical abuse at all state-designated trauma centers or ACS-verified trauma and children's surgery hospitals. APSA supports admitting suspected child abuse patients to surgical trauma services due to the potential for polytrauma and increased injury severity, ensuring reliable service coordination. Additionally, APSA stresses the importance of pediatric surgeons participating in multidisciplinary teams, including child abuse pediatricians, social workers, and Child Protective Services (CPS), to coordinate the screening, evaluation, and management of these patients. If a pediatric surgeon suspects abuse, they are legally required to report it to CPS for further investigation.

- **Conclusion**: APSA advocates for data collection on abuse screening and diagnosis in trauma registries, namely the NTDB and the Pediatric ACS TQIP®, for benchmarking and quality improvement purposes.

### Controversial aspects of imaging in child abuse: A second roundtable discussion from the ESPR child abuse taskforce [^117WhaQs]. Pediatric Radiology (2023). Low credibility.

The common sites of abusive fractures include the long bone shafts, ribs, and skull. However, the discussion of abusive skull fractures is beyond the scope of this article. Certain fractures, such as the classic metaphyseal lesion (CML), rib fractures, and the presence of multiple fractures at different stages of healing without an alternative explanation, are highly specific for abuse.

Injury patterns vary depending on the age of the patient. Rib fractures and CMLs are more prevalent in infancy, whereas long bone shaft fractures are more common in older children. Conversely, long bone shaft fractures have low specificity for abuse, as they are radiologically indistinguishable from those caused by accident.

No fracture or fracture pattern is pathognomonic of physical abuse. Determining whether a fracture is accidental or inflicted is challenging and largely depends on the patient's age, developmental level, and clinical history provided by the parent or caregiver. Any fracture in a dependent, non-ambulatory child raises concern for inflicted injury. Additionally, the identification of any fracture in suspected child abuse cases is significant, indicating the application of significant and inappropriate forces. Abuse may also be suggested if an injury is inconsistent with the usual mechanisms required to cause a specific fracture based on the radiology.

### Is early detection of abused children possible: A systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of the identification of abused children [^114WoUmR]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Child maltreatment is considered a "disease" affecting both the child and their caregiver. An abusive caregiver is characterized by their abusive behavior, which leads to child maltreatment. This behavior has detrimental effects on the health and development of the child. Therefore, identifying child maltreatment should involve the identification of both the abused child and their abusive caregiver. Two self-report questionnaires were administered to children, who were asked if they had experienced specific behaviors from parents or caregivers. Since only children who could read were able to respond, these questionnaires are not effective in reducing fatalities among the most vulnerable groups. Fatal child maltreatment predominantly occurs when children are younger; in fact, over half of the 600 child maltreatment victims under five years old, reported to the National Violent Death Reporting System in the United States from 2003 to 2006, were under one year old.

The WHO's definition of child maltreatment is problematic, as it defines the issue based on the consequences of neglectful or abusive behaviors without actually defining those behaviors. Similarly, Article 19 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child mentions "all forms of physical or mental violence, injury and abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse" without defining these behaviors. Moreover, proposed definitions that focus solely on abusive behaviors can vary significantly. For example, acts of physical contact or penetration might be used as criteria before classifying reported experiences as sexual abuse.

### A profile of suspected child abuse as a subgroup of major trauma patients [^117F7oMQ]. Emergency Medicine Journal (2015). Low credibility.

This study adds to previous studies of child abuse as a cause of major injury, and in the context of major trauma, it describes a different demography, pattern of injury, and presentation of abusive injury compared with accidental injury. In the TARN database of major trauma, suspected victims of abuse are usually under 1 year old, possess a higher ISS mainly due to severe head injury, and have a higher mortality rate than accidentally injured children.

### Anal signs of child sexual abuse: A case-control study [^114giGkm]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

There is uncertainty about the nature and specificity of physical signs following anal child sexual abuse. The study investigates the extent to which physical findings discriminate between children with and without a history of anal abuse.

- **Methods**: Retrospective case note review in a pediatric forensic unit.

- **Cases**: All eligible cases from 1990 to 2007 alleging anal abuse.

- **Controls**: All children examined anally from 1998 to 2007 with possible physical abuse or neglect with no identified concern regarding sexual abuse. Fisher's exact test (two-tailed) was performed to ascertain the significance of differences for individual signs between cases and controls. To explore the potential role of confounding, logistic regression was used to produce odds ratios adjusted for age and gender.

- **Results**: A total of 184 cases (105 boys, 79 girls), average age 98.5 months (range 26 to 179), were compared with 179 controls (94 boys, 85 girls), average age 83.7 months (range 35 to 193). Of the cases, 136 (74%) had one or more signs described in anal abuse, compared to 29 (16%) controls. 79 (43%) cases and 2 (1.1%) controls had more than one sign. Reflex anal dilatation (RAD) and venous congestion were seen in 22% and 36% of cases but less than 1% of controls (likelihood ratios (LR) 40, 60 respectively), anal fissure in 14% of cases and 1.1% of controls (LR 13), and anal laxity in 27% of cases and 3% of controls (LR 10). Novel signs seen significantly more commonly in cases were anal fold changes, swelling, and twitching. Erythema, swelling, and fold changes were seen most commonly within 7 days of last reported contact.

### Child sexual abuse [^115sR3ic]. Lancet (2004). Low credibility.

Child sexual abuse is a worldwide concern. It is an insidious, persistent, and serious problem that, depending on the population studied and definition used, affects 2–62% of women and 3–16% of men as victims. While pain and tissue injury from child sexual abuse can completely heal over time, the psychological and medical consequences may persist into adulthood. Associated sexually transmitted diseases, such as HIV, and attempts at suicide can be fatal. All physicians who treat children should be aware of the manifestations and consequences of child sexual abuse and should be familiar with normal and abnormal genital and anal anatomy of children.

This aim is best accomplished through training and routine examination of the anus and genitalia of children. Because as many as 96% of children assessed for suspected sexual abuse will have normal genital and anal examinations, a forensic interview by a trained professional must be relied on to document suspicion of abuse.

### Child abuse and conditions that mimic it [^112dbdQc]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2018). Low credibility.

One to two percent of children in the United States are confirmed victims of child abuse, with many more likely affected. Diagnosing child abuse can be challenging due to often misleading medical histories. Acute care providers should be aware of the warning signs and know how to evaluate and document suspicious physical findings. Young children who cannot disclose abuse are most vulnerable to forms with high morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it is crucial to include it in the differential diagnosis and to be capable of ruling out medical conditions that mimic abuse.

### Actiq [^11385b7a]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2023). High credibility.

Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)

Because of the risk for accidental exposure, misuse, abuse, addiction, and overdose, Actiq is available only through a restricted program required by the Food and Drug Administration, called a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). Under the Transmucosal Immediate Release Fentanyl (TIRF) REMS, pharmacies, outpatients, and healthcare professionals who prescribe to outpatients must enroll in the program. Inpatient pharmacies must develop policies and procedures to verify opioid tolerance in inpatients who require Actiq while hospitalized [see Warnings and Precautions (5.7)]. Further information is available at www.TIRFREMSAccess.com or by calling 1–866–822–1483.

Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS)

If opioid use is required for an extended period of time in a pregnant woman, advise the patient of the risk of NOWS, which may be life-threatening if not recognized and treated. Ensure that management by neonatology experts will be available at delivery [see Warnings and Precautions (5.8)].

- **Warning: Serious and life-threatening risks from use of Actiq**: See full prescribing information for complete boxed warning. Actiq exposes users to risks of addiction, abuse, and misuse, which can lead to overdose and death. Assess the patient's risk before prescribing and reassess regularly for these behaviors and conditions (5.1). Serious, life-threatening, or fatal respiratory depression has occurred in patients treated with Actiq, including following use in opioid non-tolerant patients and improper dosing. Regularly evaluate patients for these conditions.

### Clinical evaluation and management of children with suspected physical abuse [^111Hz4rz]. Pediatric Radiology (2021). Low credibility.

Evaluating and managing children with suspected physical abuse is challenging. Few single injuries are pathognomonic for abuse, and as a result, child abuse is easily missed. A healthy bit of skepticism is needed to recognize and protect abused children. The medical history and clinical presentation should guide the evaluation. Medical providers must consider the differential diagnosis, epidemiology of injuries, and child development to inform the assessment. In this review, we address evidence-based recommendations to inform child physical abuse evaluations. We also discuss the role of medical providers in communicating with families, mandated reporting, and interpreting medical information for investigative agencies and other non-medical colleagues entrusted with protecting children.

### Use of imaging in children with witnessed physical abuse [^1115cSpR]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2019). Low credibility.

Physicians are occasionally asked to evaluate children who are reported to have been victims of witnessed abuse but who have no injuries noted on examination. The rate of injury in these patients is presently unknown. This is important because abuse allegations are brought for both altruistic and other reasons. This study compares the use of skeletal survey and neuroimaging in well-appearing and clearly injured children reported to be victims of witnessed child abuse.

- **Methods**: A retrospectively planned secondary analysis of the Examination of Siblings to Recognize Abuse cohort of children referred to a child abuse pediatrician with concerns for physical abuse was conducted. Children were selected who presented to a medical provider with a history of witnessed child abuse, including shaking. Rates of radiographically evident injuries are noted among children with and without injuries noted on physical examination.

- **Results**: Among 2890 children evaluated by a child abuse pediatrician, 90 children (3.1%) presented with a history of witnessed abuse. Among these, 51 children (57%) had injuries noted on physical examination; 9 (29%) of 31 skeletal surveys and 9 (35%) of 26 neuroimaging studies revealed injuries. Of 39 children (43%) with witnessed abuse and normal examination, 3 (10%) of 30 skeletal surveys and 2 (8%) of 25 neuroimaging studies revealed an injury.

- **Conclusions**: A significant minority of children evaluated for allegations of witnessed abuse will have occult injuries identified radiographically. Absence of visible injury on examination should not deter physicians from obtaining further diagnostic imaging in these cases.

### Perceived social risk in medical decision-making for physical child abuse: A mixed-methods study [^111Lwxs7]. BMC Pediatrics (2017). Low credibility.

Medical decision-making in cases of suspected child abuse has important consequences. An incorrect diagnosis may return an abused child to the abusive home; conversely, it may subject non-abusive families to legal remedies and stigma. Prior studies have shown several concerning trends: physicians are more comfortable reporting poor children for abuse; African American children are more likely than Caucasian children to undergo an abuse evaluation for fractures; Caucasian children are less likely to be evaluated for abusive head trauma than minority children; and decisions about discharging children home from the emergency department with a diagnosis of abuse depend upon socioeconomic status. These studies documented differential decision-making in the evaluation and disposition of children with suspected physical abuse.

Differences in medical decision-making may reflect differences in risk indicators for abuse among poor and minority children not captured in administrative datasets. They may also reflect differences in treating physicians' perceptions of the risk for abuse among poor and minority children. Social risk perception, defined here as the perceived risk for child abuse based on social aspects of the child's medical evaluation rather than physical, laboratory, or radiologic aspects of the evaluation, may play a role in how children are evaluated. Medical assessments of child physical abuse risk may be particularly vulnerable to physicians' perceptions of abuse risk, as child abuse pediatricians (CAPs) incorporate the child's entire social ecology into their evaluation.

### Defining sentinel injuries of suspected child abuse by age using International Classification of Diseases-10: A Delphi study [^114jsyAX]. Pediatric Emergency Care (2023). Low credibility.

Reports of child abuse in South Korea increased from approximately 10,000 cases per year before the enforcement of the Special Act on the Punishment of Child Abuse Crimes in 2014 to 52,000 cases per year in 2021. However, this figure reflects only an increase in public concern and reporting, and the actual number of cases of child abuse remains unknown and difficult to predict.

It is challenging to accurately determine the scale of child abuse, but it might be estimated through the incidence of sentinel injuries. A sentinel injury is defined as a minor but unusual bruise and/or other wound found in children of precruising age. It is rare for a child to be seriously injured or killed by a single instance of abuse. Most cases of children who experience serious injuries or death result from repeated and escalating abuse. Thus, sentinel injury data could serve as early signs of child abuse. Sheets et al. reported that 27.5% of abused children had a history of a sentinel injury, and Lindberg et al. indicated that children with sentinel injuries were more likely to have been exposed to child abuse.

Although the exact incidence of child abuse is not known, in-depth studies have long been conducted. Additionally, studies on using sentinel injuries for early recognition of, and intervention in, child abuse have been actively performed. In South Korea, social interest in child abuse is relatively recent following several child abuse cases. Previously, child abuse in the country was mainly studied in the fields of humanities and sociology rather than medicine.

### Interpretation of medical findings in suspected child sexual abuse: An update for 2018 [^1116VpSP]. Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology (2018). Low credibility.

Most sexually abused children will not have signs of genital or anal injury, especially when examined non-acutely. A recent study reported that only 2.2% (26 of 1160) of sexually abused girls examined non-acutely had diagnostic physical findings, whereas among those examined acutely, the prevalence of injuries was 21.4% (73 of 340).

It is important for health care professionals who examine children who might have been sexually abused to be able to recognize and interpret any physical signs or laboratory results that might be found. In this review, we summarize new data and recommendations concerning documentation of medical examinations, testing for sexually transmitted infections, interpretation of lesions caused by human papillomavirus and herpes simplex virus in children, and interpretation of physical examination findings. Updates to a table listing an approach to the interpretation of medical findings are presented, and reasons for changes are discussed.

### Identifying children exposed to maltreatment: A systematic review update [^111sURcw]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

There is low to very low certainty evidence that the use of screening tools may result in high numbers of children being falsely suspected or missed. These harms may outweigh the potential benefits of using such tools in practice. In addition, before considering screening tools in clinical programs and settings, research is needed that identifies patient-important outcomes of screening strategies, such as the reduction of recurrence.

### Anal signs of child sexual abuse: a case-control study [^11547Xwr]. BMC Pediatrics (2014). Low credibility.

There is uncertainty about the nature and specificity of physical signs following anal child sexual abuse. The study investigates the extent to which physical findings discriminate between children with and without a history of anal abuse.

- **Methods**: Retrospective case note review in a pediatric forensic unit. Cases included all eligible cases from 1990 to 2007 alleging anal abuse. Controls comprised all children examined anally from 1998 to 2007 with possible physical abuse or neglect, with no identified concern regarding sexual abuse. Fisher's exact test (two-tailed) was performed to ascertain the significance of differences for individual signs between cases and controls. To explore the potential role of confounding, logistic regression was used to produce odds ratios adjusted for age and gender.

- **Results**: A total of 184 cases (105 boys, 79 girls), average age 98.5 months (range 26 to 179), were compared with 179 controls (94 boys, 85 girls), average age 83.7 months (range 35–193). Of the cases, 136 (74%) had one or more signs described in anal abuse, compared to 29 (16%) controls. Seventy-nine (43%) cases and 2 (1.1%) controls had more than one sign. Reflex anal dilatation (RAD) and venous congestion were seen in 22% and 36% of cases but less than 1% of controls (likelihood ratios [LR] 40, 60 respectively); anal fissure was present in 14% of cases and 1.1% of controls (LR 13), and anal laxity in 27% of cases and 3% of controls (LR 10).

Novel signs seen significantly more commonly in cases included anal fold changes, swelling, and twitching. Erythema, swelling, and fold changes were seen most commonly within 7 days of last reported contact.

### Is early detection of abused children possible? A systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of the identification of abused children [^112fvAwG]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

The study investigates whether early detection of abused children is feasible through a systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of various identification methods. The research addresses the pressing need for reliable tools and protocols to identify cases of child abuse at an early stage, potentially preventing further harm.

- **Conceptualization and design**: The study was conceptualized and designed to explore diagnostic methods and their accuracy in identifying abused children.

- **Data acquisition, analysis, and interpretation**: Comprehensive analysis of data was performed, focusing on the validity of identification techniques.

- **Manuscript preparation and review**: The initial manuscript was drafted, critically reviewed, and all authors have contributed their expertise in analysis, interpretation, and the final approval of the study.

The research highlights the importance of precise and systematic approaches to improve the early detection of child abuse, contributing to the body of knowledge in pediatric care and protective services.

### Facilitators and barriers to screening for child abuse in the emergency department [^117Shi2a]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

To identify facilitators and barriers to screening for child abuse in emergency departments (ED), interviews were conducted with ED staff, members of the hospital board, and related experts.

- **Methods**: This qualitative study is based on semi-structured interviews with 27 professionals from seven Dutch hospitals, including seven pediatricians, two surgeons, six ED nurses, six ED managers, and six hospital board members. The resulting list of facilitators and barriers was subsequently discussed with five experts in child abuse and one implementation expert. The results are ordered using the Child Abuse Framework of the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate, which legally requires screening for child abuse.

- **Results**: Lack of knowledge of child abuse, communication with parents in cases of suspected abuse, and lack of time for policy development are barriers for ED staff in screening for child abuse. For board members, lack of resources, time, and a high turnover of ED staff are impediments to improving child abuse policy. Screening can be promoted by training ED staff to better recognize child abuse, improving communication skills, appointing an attendant specifically for child abuse, and obtaining explicit management support for the screening policy. National implementation of an approved protocol and validated screening instrument is also recommended.

- **Conclusions**: ED staff are motivated to comply with the Dutch Health Care Inspectorate requirements but experience many barriers, particularly regarding communication with parents of children suspected of being abused. Introduction of a national compliance system is needed to address these issues.

### Identifying risk factors of children who suffered physical abuse: A systematic review [^1136oSuB]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

This systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Covidence (Melbourne, Australia) was used to conduct and manage this review process.

- **Search strategy**: A comprehensive search of the electronic databases PubMed (Medline), PubMed Central, and Embase was conducted from January 1, 2012, to December 31, 2022. We used a combination of keywords and Medical Subject Headings terms, including "abuse", "risk factors", and "children", along with their appropriate variations. The reviewed articles were cross-referenced for any relevant articles, which were included as well.

- **Selection criteria**: Eligible study designs include case series (n ≥ 20 patients), cohort studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies, retrospective chart reviews, and randomized controlled trials. We included studies evaluating clinical, demographic, and radiographic risk factors associated with substantiated or suspected physical child abuse. Studies may have been conducted in any country but must have been published in the English language. Studies including populations exclusively older than 18 years were excluded. Two reviewers independently first screened the titles and abstracts of all identified articles against the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

### Identifying risk factors of children who suffered physical abuse: A systematic review [^115wPpw4]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global research & reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Approximately one in four children in the United States experience child abuse or neglect during their lifetime, 18% of whom are victims of physical abuse. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), physical child abuse is defined as "the intentional use of physical force that can result in physical injury". Physical child abuse remains a major public health issue, despite notable efforts to prevent and address such cases. Approximately one in four children are abused in their lifetime, with 18% of those children experiencing physical abuse. Previous literature reports an incidence of physical child abuse ranging from 0.03% to 100%, depending on the nature of the study and the specifics of the study populations included. These cases of abuse present devastating consequences for both children and families that extend beyond the acute trauma and can result in long-term physical and psychosocial harm.

Physicians and other health care workers are in a unique position to identify children who are at risk and/or are victims of physical child abuse, as providers are often the first contact for abuse victims. If detected early, the damaging consequences of such abuse may be mitigated, and subsequent prompt action can be taken to remove the child from a dangerous situation by alerting the proper authorities. Therefore, it is crucial to recognize victims when encountered. Physicians are responsible for facilitating immediate contact with child protection agencies and determining the cause of associated injury while adequately documenting supporting evidence.

### Femur fractures in the pediatric population: Abuse or accidental trauma [^114nugGT]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Orthopaedic surgeons play a critical role in evaluating potential cases of child abuse, as fractures are the second most common presentation of abuse following soft tissue injuries. Numerous studies have focused on the characteristics of fractures typically associated with abuse, including those of the femur, humerus, tibia, and ribs. Despite this, orthopaedic surgeons are often less likely than general pediatric and emergency room colleagues to identify abuse as a potential cause of these fractures, resulting in delays in necessary multidisciplinary intervention. This issue is concerning because, among the millions of children annually victimized by substantiated abuse in the United States, orthopaedic surgeons are frequently the first clinicians to evaluate them. Failure to recognize the cause of injury can lead these children back into abusive environments, with a 50% risk of reinjury and a 10% risk of death. Therefore, it is essential for orthopaedic surgeons not only to treat the fractures presented by these children but also to recognize the potential etiologic characteristics that may suggest child abuse.

When examining a fracture in the emergency room, the following questions should be considered: What patient characteristics may indicate abuse versus accidental trauma? Is the history and mechanism of injury inconsistent with the present injury? Does this fracture's type, pattern, and location suggest potential abuse? Fractures of the femur in young children provide an exemplary model for developing a systematic examination procedure.

### Child abuse and the pediatric surgeon: A position statement from the Trauma Committee, the Board of Governors and the Membership of the American Pediatric Surgical Association [^111mGxEo]. Journal of Pediatric Surgery (2019). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for child abuse, particularly with respect to indications for admission, APSA 2019 guidelines recommend admitting patients with suspected child physical abuse to a surgical trauma service. This recommendation is based on the potential for polytrauma, increased severity of injury, and the need for reliable coordination of services, including mandatory reporting to Child Protective Services.

### Is early detection of abused children possible? A systematic review of the diagnostic accuracy of the identification of abused children [^111DJ7p5]. BMC Pediatrics (2013). Low credibility.

Assessment of the accuracy of instruments is difficult because there is no gold standard for identifying abused children. To optimize the reference standard, opinions of experts or medical, social, or judicial teams are usually used, but the accuracy of these assessments is not known. Furthermore, the information used for this assessment was rarely specified, making it difficult to verify the independence between the index test and the reference standard. The incorporation of index test results into the reference standard would overestimate the test's accuracy.

Chang et al. used the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), 9th Revision, and E-codes (External cause) for reference standard, categorizing intent and mechanism of an injury. In a recent study in the Yale-New Haven Children's Hospital from 2007 to 2010, the specificity of coding injuries as physical abuse was 100% (95% CI: 96–100). However, the sensitivity was low: among the 43 cases determined to be abused by the Child Abuse Pediatrician, four were miscoded as accidents, two as injuries of undetermined cause, and four did not receive any injury code. In California, during 1991–1992, the sensitivity of hospital E-coded data in identifying child victims of intentional injuries was estimated at 75% (95% CI: 64–84). This classification underestimates the number of abused children, and therefore does not seem to be a good reference test. Cases of child physical abuse are considered accidents, and cases classified as physical abuse are not representative of all cases of physical abuse.

### Identifying children exposed to maltreatment: A systematic review update [^113G7jqV]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

This review builds upon the work of Bailhache et al. and performs a systematic review with the objective of assessing evidence about the accuracy of instruments for identifying children suspected of having been exposed to maltreatment (neglect, as well as physical, sexual abuse, emotional abuse). Similar to the review by Bailhache et al, we investigate both screening tools and other identification tools or strategies that could be adapted into screening tools.

In addition to reviewing the sensitivity and specificity of instruments, as was done by Bailhache et al. for five studies, we have also calculated estimates of false positives and negatives per 100 children, a calculation which can assist providers in making decisions about the use of an instrument. This review contributes to an important policy debate about the benefits and limitations of using standardized tools (versus case-finding) to identify children exposed to maltreatment. This debate has become increasingly salient with the publication of screening tools for adverse childhood experiences, or tools that address child maltreatment alongside other adverse experiences.

It should be noted here that while "screening" typically implies identifying health problems, screening for child maltreatment is different in that it usually involves identifying risk factors or high-risk groups. As such, while studies evaluating tools that assist with identification of child maltreatment are typically referred to as diagnostic accuracy studies, the word "diagnosis" is potentially misleading. Instead, screening tools for child maltreatment…

### Identifying risk factors of children who suffered physical abuse: A systematic review [^111JAteM]. Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Global Research & Reviews (2025). Low credibility.

Clinical indications were analyzed in 25 of the 63 reviewed articles pertaining to physical child abuse. Of these, 19 articles presented statistically significant data. The most common clinical sign indicative of abuse was found to be head injuries, as reported in 16 articles. The specific head injuries most commonly associated with abuse included intracranial injury, subdural hematoma, and traumatic brain injury. Additionally, nine articles included facial injuries, with retinal hemorrhage, edema, bleeding, or retinal detachment reported in seven articles. Superficial skin injuries were also reported in three articles and represented the most common type classified in the "other" category.

- **Radiographic indications**: Radiological signs were examined in 11 of the 61 reviewed articles. Of these, 10 articles provided statistically significant data. Nine articles focused on radiological factors related to head injuries, with hemorrhage being the most common, present in eight articles. Skull fractures were noted in five articles. Furthermore, an association between child abuse and lung injury was found in only one article, discussing pneumothorax, pulmonary contusion, and pulmonary laceration as potential indicators.

### Facilitators and barriers to screening for child abuse in the emergency department [^115v6o14]. BMC Pediatrics (2012). Low credibility.

As part of the study, "Screening for child abuse in EDs, implementation of an optimal protocol", interviews were conducted with 27 professionals affiliated with at least one of the seven participating hospitals in the province of South Holland, the Netherlands. These hospitals included one university (urban) children's hospital, four urban teaching hospitals, and two rural peripheral hospitals. Each hospital featured an emergency department where children of all ages received treatment. Some emergency departments had implemented child abuse screening prior to the survey, with a duration ranging from several years to as recent as one year.

Interviews were held at their offices with members from four professional groups: nine senior physicians (comprising seven pediatricians and two surgeons), six hospital board members, six emergency department nurses, and six emergency department managers. These groups were selected based on their direct role in detecting child abuse in the emergency department, or their responsibility for child abuse policies. The interviews aimed to identify facilitators and barriers to the detection of child abuse.

In the second phase of the study, these identified facilitators and barriers were reviewed by five child abuse experts and one implementation expert, who provided advice on addressing the barriers. The experts included a pediatrician specializing in child abuse prevention, a forensic pediatrician, a hospital attendant for child abuse, a forensic nurse specializing in child abuse detection, and a senior researcher specializing in child abuse prevention.

### Testing for abuse in children with sentinel injuries [^114546eU]. Pediatrics (2015). Low credibility.

Child physical abuse is commonly missed, putting abused children at risk for repeated injury and death. Several so-called sentinel injuries have been suggested to be associated with high rates of abuse and imply the need for routine testing for other, occult traumatic injuries. Our objective was to determine rates of abuse evaluation and diagnosis among children evaluated at leading children's hospitals with these putative sentinel injuries.

- **Methods**: This is a retrospective secondary analysis of the Pediatric Health Information System database. We identified 30,355 children with putative sentinel injuries, measuring rates of abuse diagnosis and rates of testing commonly used to identify occult injuries.

- **Results**: Among all visits for children less than 24 months old to Pediatric Health Information System hospitals, the rate of abuse diagnosis was 0.17%. Rates of abuse diagnosis for children with at least one putative sentinel injury ranged from 3.5% for children less than 12 months old with burns to 56.1% for children under 24 months with rib fractures. Rates of skeletal survey and other testing that can identify occult traumatic injury were highly variable between centers and for different injuries.

- **Conclusions**: Several putative sentinel injuries are associated with high rates of physical abuse. Among eligible children with rib fractures, abdominal trauma, or intracranial hemorrhage, rates of abuse were more than 20%. Future work is warranted to test whether routine testing for abuse in these children can improve early recognition of abuse.

### Identifying children exposed to maltreatment: A systematic review update [^1159uRVG]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

Child maltreatment, including physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect, impacts a significant number of children worldwide. For example, a survey involving a nationally representative sample of American children, selected using telephone numbers from 2013 to 2014, found that lifetime rates of maltreatment for children aged 14 to 17 were 18.1% for physical abuse, 23.9% for emotional abuse, 18.4% for neglect, and 14.3% and 6.0% for sexual abuse of girls and boys, respectively.

Child maltreatment is associated with numerous physical, emotional, and relationship consequences across the lifespan, such as developmental delay first seen in infancy; anxiety and mood disorder symptoms and poor peer relationships first seen in childhood; substance use and other risky behaviors often first seen in adolescence; and increased risk for personality and psychiatric disorders, relationship problems, and maltreatment of one's own children in adulthood. Given the high prevalence and serious potential negative consequences of child maltreatment, clinicians need to be informed about strategies to accurately identify children potentially exposed to maltreatment, a task that "can be one of the most challenging and difficult responsibilities for the pediatrician".

Two main strategies for the identification of maltreatment — screening and case-finding — are often compared to one another in the literature. Screening involves administering a standard set of questions or applying a standard set of criteria to assess the suspicion of child maltreatment in all presenting children.

### Identifying children exposed to maltreatment: A systematic review update [^114SLcMY]. BMC Pediatrics (2020). Low credibility.

A protocol for this review is registered with the online systematic review register, PROSPERO (PROSPERO 2016:CRD42016039659), and study results are reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) checklist (see supplemental file 1). As the review by Bailhache et al. considered any English or French materials published between 1961 and April 2012 (only English-language materials were retrieved from their search), we searched for English-language materials published between 2012 and July 2, 2019, when the search was conducted. Additional inclusion criteria are found in Table 1.

Inclusion criteria for this review were matched to those in Bailhache et al.'s review. We included diagnostic accuracy studies that 1) evaluated a group of children by a test, examination, or other procedure (hereafter referred to as the index test) designed to identify children potentially exposed to maltreatment and also 2) evaluated the same group of children (or ideally a random subsample) by a reference standard that confirmed or denied exposure to potential maltreatment. Acceptable reference standards are listed in Table 1. We excluded articles that assessed psychometric properties of child maltreatment measures unless diagnostic data was available in the paper.

The searches for the review update were conducted in seven databases: MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Sociological Abstracts, the Education Resources Information Center, and Cochrane.

### Systems-based care of the injured child: Technical report [^112WQwJ6]. The Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery (2025). Low credibility.

A unique aspect of pediatric trauma care is the need for awareness and recognition of signs of child abuse and neglect. Various historical factors, examination findings, and diagnostic testing results are associated with child physical abuse. A combination of these findings is often included in institution-specific screening tools. It is important to note that multiple reports have identified disparities in child abuse reporting, with children from historically marginalized racial or ethnic groups disproportionately identified as potential victims of abuse and more likely to be investigated, subject to unnecessary tests, and to have a change of caregiver at discharge. Minimizing disparities in reporting and unnecessary tests requires a multipronged approach, including clinical pathways, guidelines, and staff education on bias reduction.

Multidisciplinary teams that care for children with suspected child abuse often include social work and pediatricians with expertise in child abuse recognition and management, if available. The use of telemedicine or remote consultation may help expand the reach of trained child abuse pediatricians and their expertise. The ACS, EMSC Innovation and Improvement Center, and American Pediatric Surgical Association have all published resources and guidelines for the assessment of child abuse. For children with suspected physical abuse, the ACS recommends consultation with a surgical trauma service, in addition to a child abuse physician and social worker. Diagnostic studies beyond what would typically be pursued for the injury are recommended.

### Unexplained fractures: Child abuse or bone disease? A systematic review [^1147kvp6]. Clinical Orthopaedics and Related Research (2011). Low credibility.

Child abuse and neglect (CAN) is a serious problem, and an improper diagnosis carries tremendous consequences for the patient, their family, and the doctor. A substantial degree of morbidity and mortality is associated with a missed diagnosis, with a reinjury rate of 50% and a mortality rate of 10% for unprotected children. In addition, the emotional trauma for the patient and family undergoing a prolonged investigation by Child Protective Services, and possibly even the wrongful removal of custody, demonstrates the power of a misguided diagnosis of abuse. With fractures representing the second most common manifestation of child abuse after soft tissue trauma, orthopedic surgeons are at the forefront of evaluating patients with potential CAN.

Many studies have described the musculoskeletal manifestations of child abuse: rib fractures, skull fractures, and humeral and femur fractures are among the most common. Recent studies have demonstrated that the combination of patient age and fracture location can reproducibly differentiate abuse from accidental trauma. Among these factors, a suspicious history, physical or radiographic evidence of prior injury, and age younger than 18 months are associated with CAN.

In 1962, Kempe et al. introduced the concept of "battered child syndrome". They included osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) as part of the differential diagnosis of a patient presenting with potential abuse. The authors noted that OI should be easily distinguishable from abuse based on history and physical examination. Despite their assertions, ther
