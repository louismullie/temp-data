## Question

Why is AZO not working for bladder pain

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking why AZO (phenazopyridine) is not working for bladder pain. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what AZO actually is and what it is indicated to treat. Then, I should verify the likely diagnosis behind persistent bladder pain, especially interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). Next, I will examine the pathophysiology of IC/BPS to see if AZO's mechanism plausibly addresses it. After that, I should review the evidence base for phenazopyridine in bladder pain conditions. Then, I will align this with guideline-based management of IC/BPS and outline safer, evidence-informed alternatives. Finally, I will consider red flags, diagnostic confirmation, and a practical action plan with follow-up and expectations.

> Let me first confirm the product and its intended use. AZO is an over-the-counter urinary analgesic containing phenazopyridine, which provides short-term relief of dysuria (burning/discomfort) and is not an antibacterial; it is typically used briefly for UTI-associated irritation, not for chronic bladder pain syndromes, and there is no evidence of benefit beyond about 15 days, with contraindications in significant renal or hepatic impairment [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions — why is the pain persisting despite AZO? I need to check whether the clinical picture fits IC/BPS rather than a simple UTI. IC/BPS presents with chronic bladder pain, often worsened by filling, with urinary frequency/urgency and negative cultures; diagnosis is clinical after excluding infection and other causes, and symptoms should be present for at least 6 weeks, which explains why a short-course urinary analgesic like phenazopyridine would not be expected to help [^115AtvJ8] [^112uUEpZ].

> Next, I should review the pathophysiology to see if there's a mechanistic mismatch. IC/BPS pain is multifactorial, involving urothelial dysfunction, neurogenic inflammation, central sensitization, and often pelvic floor dysfunction; phenazopyridine's topical mucosal analgesia does not address these deeper drivers, so sustained benefit is unlikely, especially in chronic pain phenotypes with widespread pain or central amplification [^112a2i4B] [^115K81nw].

> Wait, let me verify the evidence base for phenazopyridine in this context. I should double-check whether any trials show benefit for bladder pain beyond transient dysuria relief. A randomized trial of a single pre-procedure dose did not reduce bladder discomfort during embryo transfer, and contemporary IC/BPS guidelines do not list phenazopyridine as a treatment for chronic bladder pain; rather, they emphasize that no single therapy works for most patients and that ineffective treatments should be stopped, which aligns with the lack of efficacy here [^1172L2Hh] [^116fyYZj] [^113PvaDX].

> I will now examine guideline-concordant alternatives. Let me think about oral agents with modest but real signals: amitriptyline has Grade B evidence and is commonly used starting low and titrating; cimetidine has supportive RCT data but limited exposure; pentosan polysulfate has mixed RCT results and is FDA-approved for IC/BPS, though some guidelines are cautious and others supportive, so shared decision-making about risks (including rare retinal toxicity) is essential; hydroxyzine has weaker evidence and high adverse event rates, so expectations should be tempered [^113fkj5u] [^113AkUUN] [^116ucNLL] [^116AYDYq] [^114AJq7V].

> But wait, what if the pain is driven by pelvic floor or central mechanisms rather than bladder mucosa alone? I should confirm whether pelvic floor physical therapy has been offered, because when pelvic floor tenderness is present, it carries a Standard recommendation and can meaningfully reduce pain; additionally, multimodal pain strategies, stress management, and behavioral modifications are foundational and often more impactful than any single drug in IC/BPS [^116fyYZj] [^116o1A1T] [^115TMSpw].

> Next, I should review intravesical and procedural options if oral therapy fails. Bladder instillations (e.g. DMSO, heparin-containing combinations, chondroitin sulfate) may help selected patients, though evidence is variable and guidelines often frame these as Options; neuromodulation can be considered after conservative measures; for Hunner lesions, fulguration or steroid injection is a Recommendation and tends to yield meaningful benefit, so cystoscopic evaluation can be pivotal in the right phenotype [^113ZYYrB] [^114WCyFg] [^1146S8pH].

> I need to ensure we are not missing an alternative diagnosis. Let me reconsider the basics: repeat urinalysis and culture if symptoms persist, assess for hematuria, and use voiding diaries and validated symptom instruments (ICSI/ICPI, GUPI, VAS) to phenotype and track response; if multiple appropriate therapies fail, I should double-check the diagnosis and consider referral to urology or a pelvic pain specialist, because overlapping conditions like endometriosis, chronic prostatitis/CPPS, or even functional obstruction can masquerade as bladder pain [^112uUEpZ] [^113sFbae] [^112QAuci].

> Hold on, I should verify safety and stewardship issues too. Phenazopyridine beyond 15 days lacks supportive evidence and carries risks in renal or hepatic impairment; relying on it chronically can delay effective care. I should confirm that we are using a structured pain plan, reassessing periodically, stopping ineffective treatments, and setting realistic expectations — complete remission is uncommon, but meaningful symptom control and function improvement are achievable with multimodal care and patience [^113p1tfv] [^113PvaDX] [^112FvnvS].

> Putting this together, my action plan is as follows: stop ongoing phenazopyridine use for chronic bladder pain; confirm IC/BPS with history, exam, and negative infection workup; initiate education and behavioral strategies; consider amitriptyline or, after discussing risks, pentosan polysulfate as a trial with predefined response criteria; add pelvic floor physical therapy if tenderness is present; escalate to intravesicals or neuromodulation if needed; and refer for cystoscopy if Hunner lesions are suspected or if no improvement occurs after several well-conducted trials, documenting baseline and serial symptom scores to guide decisions [^116fyYZj] [^112uUEpZ] [^114WCyFg] [^113sFbae].

> In summary, AZO is not working because phenazopyridine is a short-term urinary analgesic for dysuria, not a treatment for the complex, chronic pain of IC/BPS; its mechanism does not target urothelial dysfunction, neurogenic inflammation, or central sensitization, and there is no evidence of benefit in this indication, so guideline-based multimodal therapy should be pursued instead [^113p1tfv] [^116fyYZj].

---

AZO (phenazopyridine) may not relieve bladder pain because it only masks **mucosal irritation** [^113p1tfv] and does not treat underlying causes such as interstitial cystitis, infection, or nerve injury. It is a short-term analgesic for dysuria, not for **chronic bladder pain** [^113p1tfv], and is ineffective for neuropathic or inflammatory pain [^113p1tfv]. Persistent pain warrants evaluation for IC/BPS [^115N88ZN], infection, or other pathology, and management should follow guideline-based, **multimodal therapy** [^116o1A1T] [^11751eoz].

---

## Pharmacological mechanism of Azo (phenazopyridine)

Phenazopyridine is a **urinary tract analgesic** that provides topical relief of mucosal discomfort; it is not an anti-inflammatory, antibiotic, or antispasmodic [^113p1tfv]. It is indicated for short-term relief of dysuria, urgency, and frequency — not for chronic bladder pain syndromes [^113p1tfv].

---

## Limitations of AZO in treating bladder pain

### Short-term relief

Phenazopyridine is intended for **short-term use (≤ 2 days)** without medical supervision and is not recommended for chronic pain management [^notfound].

---

### Surface-level analgesia

It provides only **mucosal surface analgesia** and does not address underlying inflammatory, neuropathic, or muscular pain mechanisms common in chronic bladder pain syndromes [^notfound].

---

### Lack of efficacy in chronic conditions

There is **no evidence** supporting phenazopyridine for chronic bladder pain syndromes such as interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) [^notfound] or chronic pelvic pain [^notfound].

---

## Common underlying causes of bladder pain unresponsive to Azo

| **Condition** | **Description** | **Why azo is ineffective** |
|-|-|-|
| Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) | Chronic bladder pain with frequency/urgency and negative cultures [^112uUEpZ] | - Complex inflammatory/neuropathic pain <br/> - Not mucosal surface pain [^notfound] |
| Chronic urinary tract infections | Persistent or recurrent infections causing ongoing pain | Does not treat infection; only masks symptoms |
| Bladder stones or tumors | Mechanical irritation or obstruction | Does not address structural causes |
| Pelvic floor dysfunction | Muscle tension/spasm causing pain | Does not target muscular pain |
| Neurological conditions | Nerve injury or dysfunction | Does not address neuropathic pain |

---

## Recommended alternative treatments for bladder pain

Given AZO's limitations, **multimodal therapy** is recommended for chronic bladder pain:

- **Behavioral therapies**: Bladder training, dietary modifications, stress management [^115TMSpw].
- **Physical therapy**: Pelvic floor therapy for muscle-related pain [^116fyYZj].
- **Pharmacological treatments**: Amitriptyline, pentosan polysulfate sodium, antihistamines, and neuromodulators [^112u34Kv] [^111YePQx].
- **Intravesical therapies**: Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), heparin, or hyaluronic acid instillations [^114CDZT7].
- **Neuromodulation**: Sacral neuromodulation for refractory cases [^114WCyFg].

---

## Clinical guidelines and expert recommendations

AUA guidelines emphasize **shared decision-making** [^116fyYZj], multimodal therapy [^116o1A1T], and periodic reassessment of treatment efficacy; ineffective treatments should be discontinued [^114tALFt]. AZO is not recommended for chronic bladder pain management [^notfound].

---

## Patient-specific factors influencing AZO effectiveness

- **Severity and chronicity**: More severe or chronic pain is less likely to respond to surface analgesia.
- **Underlying pathology**: Structural, inflammatory, or neurological causes reduce efficacy.
- **Individual sensitivity**: Variability in pain perception and response to analgesics.

---

## Conclusion and recommendations

AZO is a short-term analgesic for mucosal discomfort and does not address the complex mechanisms of chronic bladder pain. Persistent pain warrants evaluation for IC/BPS, infection, or other pathology, and management should follow **guideline-based, multimodal therapy** [^116fyYZj].

### Pentosan polysulfate sodium for treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: insights from a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study [^1115gF3L]. The Journal of Urology (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

We compared the efficacy and safety of the currently recommended dose of pentosan polysulfate sodium with a third of the daily dose and with placebo.

Materials and Methods

In this multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled study 368 adults with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome, defined as an ICSI total score of 8 or greater and a score of greater than 0 on the 4 ICSI component items, received pentosan polysulfate sodium 100 mg once daily or 3 times daily, or matching placebo for 24 weeks. Study eligibility was not based on cystoscopy findings. ICSI was administered at baseline, and at weeks 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24. Unblinded interim analysis performed at 6 years with 54% of the target number of 645 patients enrolled resulted in early study termination.

Results

There was no statistically significant difference between the pentosan polysulfate sodium group and the placebo group or between the 2 pentosan polysulfate sodium groups for the primary end point, defined as responder achieving a 30% or greater reduction from the baseline ICSI total score at study end. This primary end point was achieved by 48 of 118 patients (40.7%) in the placebo group, and by 51 of 128 (39.8%) and 52 of 122 (42.6%) in the pentosan polysulfate sodium 100 mg once daily and 3 times daily groups, respectively. Pentosan polysulfate sodium was well tolerated with a similar percent of patients (range 10.2% to 13.3%) across the groups discontinuing due to an adverse event.

Conclusions

Results of this study in a broad population of patients with symptoms consistent with interstitial cystitis revealed no treatment effect vs placebo for pentosan polysulfate sodium at the currently established dose or at a third of the daily dose.

### Use of phenazopyridine for reducing discomfort during embryo transfer [^1172L2Hh]. Fertility and Sterility (2007). Low credibility.

Objective

The embryo transfer is a critical part of in vitro fertilization. When performed under abdominal ultrasound guidance, the embryo transfer procedure requires a full bladder. Patients often state that the discomfort of the distended bladder causes more pain than the actual transfer procedure. Phenazopyridine HCl is a bladder analgesic. The objective of this study was to determine if a single dose of phenazopyridine prior to embryo transfer reduces patient discomfort during that procedure.

Design

Prospective randomized double-blinded clinical trial.

Setting

University-based Reproductive Medicine practice.

Patient(S)

Eighty-five reproductive age infertile women undergoing in vitro fertilization.

Intervention(S)

Phenazopyridine (200 mg) or placebo taken 1 hour prior to embryo transfer utilizing transabdominal sonography.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Pain as assessed by visual analogue pain scale and physician and nurse assessment of patient discomfort.

Result(S)

Study groups were similar in their demographic background. Mean pain score as assessed by a visual analogue pain scale during the procedure was 2.95 ± 2.4 in the placebo group, and 3.03 ± 2.6 in the active medication group (NS). There were also no significant differences in the observations of pain assessments.

Conclusion(S)

Phenazopyridine used in a single dose prior to embryo transfer does not alleviate patient discomfort.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^116ucNLL]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Pentosan polysulfate (PPS) for interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) has randomized and comparative trial data with varied dosing and outcomes. Pentosanpolysulfate (Evidence Strength: Grade B) and PPS is the only FDA-approved oral agent for the treatment of IC/BPS, with seven randomized trials reporting on more than 500 patients; of the five trials that included PPS and placebo arms, four were RCTs. Selected results include a multicenter RCT using PPS 200 mg twice daily with clinically significant improvement rates (56% versus 49%, respectively), a study using 100 mg three times daily with improvement (PPS 28% versus placebo 13%), two trials at three months showing higher PPS improvement (28% and 32%, respectively) versus placebo (13% and 16%, respectively) with both administering 100 mg PPS three times daily, a randomized crossover trial demonstrating pain improvement in the PPS group (44%) compared to the placebo group (15%), an open-label comparison to CyA showing a higher improvement rate for CyA (83%) than for PPS patients (21%), and a dose-response study at eight months showing no differences (300 mg daily - 50%; 600 mg daily - 40%; 900 mg daily - 45%). An unpublished randomized trial compared 100 mg PPS once daily, 100 mg PPS three times daily, and placebo for 24 weeks with a primary endpoint of at least a 30% reduction in the ICSI, yielding responder rates: Placebo - 48/118 (40.7%); PPS 100 mg once daily - 51/128 (39.8%); PPS 100 mg three times daily - 52/122 (42.6%).

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^115T6oxa]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) guideline — systematic review methods: Literature searches of English-language MEDLINE spanned January 1, 1983 to July 22, 2009, with an American Urological Association (AUA) update in July 2013 identifying an additional 31 articles, and a 2022 update (search dates: 06/2013–01/2021) identifying 63 studies, 53 of which were added to the evidence base. The review eliminated preclinical, pediatric, commentary, and editorial reports and excluded studies using treatments not available in the US, herbal or supplement treatments, or outcomes collapsed across multiple interventions; mixed patient groups were retained only when more than 50% were IC/BPS patients. Because individual study sample sizes were small, single studies were not deemed sufficient for a Standard, Recommendation, or Option, but were used to support Clinical Principles.

### How are we going to make progress treating bladder pain syndrome? ICI-RS 2013 [^111RhCMt]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2014). Low credibility.

Aims

To look at the current state of knowledge in bladder pain syndrome and ascertain how we can make advances in the near term.

Methods

A compendium of the ideas presented at the International Consultation on Incontinence Research Society 2013 meeting of clinicians and basic scientists.

Results

The meeting included the following topics: potential connection between defined and undefined IC/BPS; association between psychiatric disorders and IC/BPS; rationale for multimodal therapy approach in IC/BPS; and issues of a placebo control in human studies.

Conclusions

Translational research studies are still in need of improved animal models to study IC/BPS mechanisms and development of novel methods to objectively measure bladder pain in rodents. The need to try and develop better clinical therapies will best be met by proper phenotyping of this heterogeneous population and avoiding premature publication of clinical trials that are anecdotal and do not include randomized placebo control populations. Patients with Hunner's lesions should be identified prior to or in the course of clinical trials so that results in this subgroup can be evaluated.

Urinary analgesics — phenazopyridine dosing and cautions: Urinary analgesics may be used short term for treatment of dysuria, and phenazopyridine is an azo dye that works as a urinary tract analgesic; it is not antibacterial. The adult dosing is 100–200 mg three times per day, with reduction to 100 mg twice daily for mild renal insufficiency, and it is customarily prescribed as a short-term adjunct for a UTI. There is no evidence that it is effective beyond 15 days, and contraindications are significant renal insufficiency (< 50 mL/min) and liver failure.

### Nonneurogenic female bladder outlet obstruction: conservative and medical management [^115iqhpa]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2025). Medium credibility.

4 CONCLUSION

The recent advances in the understanding of underlying mechanisms involved in female BOO allow for more individualized management. Conservative and pharmacological options show interesting outcomes, particularly in the context of a functional cause of BOO. Anatomical etiologies may be temporarily or definitely managed by catheterization but are still usually addressed surgically.

Also, more long‐term data are required, and the academic community must carry on its effort to improve the management of this disabling condition that affects a significant proportion of the female population worldwide.

### Nonsurgical management of oligozoospermia [^114dsxbq]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2020). Medium credibility.

Male infertility secondary to oligozoospermia is surprisingly common. Although a majority of cases are idiopathic, oligozoospermia can be caused by endocrine dysfunction, anatomic abnormalities, medications, or environmental exposures. The work-up includes excluding reversible factors such as hormonal deficiency, medication effects, and retrograde ejaculation and identifying any underlying genetic syndrome and treating reversible medical causes. If no reversible cause is found, appropriate referrals to urology and assisted reproductive technology should be initiated. Lastly, clinicians should be aware of and respond to the psychological and general health ramifications of a diagnosis of oligozoospermia as part of the comprehensive care of men and couples struggling with a diagnosis of infertility.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^115JzuXM]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) pain management — essential principles and stewardship: The rights and responsibilities of the patient and clinician should be clearly stated at the outset; this may take the form of a pain management "contract". All narcotic prescriptions must come from a single source. Increasing doses of medication should be tied to improving function in activities of daily living (e.g., work, parenting, sexual intimacy, ability to exercise) rather than to just relief of pain, and the patient and clinician should set mutual goals in these areas. Patients who require continuous narcotic therapy should be primarily managed with long-acting narcotics, and small doses of short acting narcotics can be used for "breakthrough" pain. Multimodality therapy may help to minimize narcotic use and the risk of tolerance, and narcotic medications should be used in combination with one of the non-narcotic drugs. Complementary therapy (e.g., physical therapy, counseling/pain psychology, stress management), should be considered as they may minimize the dependence on pain medications.

### Targets for therapy of the painful bladder [^112gWWTH]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

Interstitial cystitis is an elusive disorder. Without a defining etiology and distinctive pathophysiology, diagnosis is made on an exclusionary basis. Treatment strategies for the disease vary, as do estimates of its prevalence. Nevertheless, advances are being made in understanding this disease. Basic research is helping to define rational treatment approaches for interstitial cystitis, and new therapies based on the findings of such research are being developed. This article reviews the theories of the etiology of interstitial cystitis and reviews the evidence for clinical effectiveness of various treatments.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^112uUEpZ]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Guideline Statement 2 — baseline voiding symptoms and pain levels should be obtained in order to measure subsequent treatment effects, and very low voiding frequencies or high voided volumes should prompt a diligent search for an alternate diagnosis. At least a one-day voiding log should be used to establish the presence of a low volume frequency voiding pattern characteristic of IC/BPS, and these values can then be used to determine if a clinically significant response to treatment has occurred. Self-report instruments such as the Genitourinary Pain Index (GUPI), ICSI, or ICPI can be used to establish a standardized baseline for later evaluation of treatment response; however, these self-report instruments are only useful to establish baseline symptom values and they are not valid tools for establishing a diagnosis. Validated questionnaires such as the GUPI or the ICSI are useful to gather comprehensive symptom information, a 1 to 10 Likert-style VAS can capture pain intensity, and patients should be queried about pain characteristics or offered a pain adjective checklist (e.g. McGill Pain Questionnaire – Short Form). Patients should be asked if their pain is worsened with bladder filling ("painful bladder filling") and/or if strong urge to urinate was due to pain, pressure, or discomfort ("painful urgency"), since these are characteristic symptoms of IC/BPS.

### Preclinical models of endometriosis and interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: an innovative medicines initiative-painCare initiative to improve their value for translational research in pelvic pain [^116rQ2m6]. Pain (2021). Medium credibility.

4.5.1. Pelvic pain and endometriosis

This analysis demonstrates that pain has rarely featured in published articles which aim to establish an effective mouse model for developing treatments for the pelvic pain conditions: ENDO and IC/BPS. It seems from the analysis that there are more articles reporting on pain in IC/BPS than in ENDO, which is puzzling. It is hugely disappointing and surprising/shocking that the importance of pain has received relatively little attention in the translational research field in these pelvic pain conditions, despite several decades of awareness raising by patients/patient representatives highlighting pain as a priority among clinicians, academics, researchers, policy makers, and the public. This is especially so in the case of ENDO which, despite having attracted increased publicity in recent years, is woefully underfunded in terms of research investment. Regretfully, there has been no consensus to date around a suitable model to develop urgently needed new treatments, addressing not only the pain symptoms associated with ENDO, but also other symptoms including infertility and fatigue. We hope this analysis together with developing a way of accurately assessing pain in rodents may be addressed by the IMI-PainCare TRiPP project ultimately leading to the development of more effective treatments for ENDO and IC/BPS.

4.5.2. Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome covers a wide spectrum of severity, varying from very mild to devastatingly severe and can be an immensely stressful disease. Its hallmark symptoms of pain or discomfort associated with an urgent and frequent need to void day and night can cause great stress, anxiety, and depression, with some patients afraid to leave their home for fear of not finding a toilet in time. The impact on work and (sexual) relationships causes further stress. Many patients say that getting IC/BPS not only changed their life but also their whole character. The fact that it may take years and many doctors to obtain the right diagnosis creates more anxiety and loss of self-confidence and may have a long-lasting detrimental psychosocial effect on the patient. Even in today's world, women's urogenital complaints are still often dismissed in Freudian style as hysteria, and this can lead to long delays in getting treatment.

### Challenges and current evidence on the management of bladder pain syndrome [^115Ai8sm]. Neurourology and Urodynamics (2014). Low credibility.

Introduction

Bladder pain syndrome (BPS) is an enigmatic condition, which can be debilitating for the patients, affecting their quality of life. Its prevalence is believed to have become markedly higher (100–300/100,000 women) than in previous years. Its etiology and pathogenesis remain unknown, and a number of theories based on clinical and experimental observations have been developed. It is difficult to be diagnosed and treated. There is a worldwide effort to standardize its nomenclature, definition, diagnosis, and treatment algorithm. The aim of this review is to critically appraise the current evidence on the diagnosis and management of BPS.

Methods

We performed a review of the literature (Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane, Google Scholar, conference proceedings) as well as consensus statements and guidelines from relevant professional societies. We have critically compared these statements and guidelines with emphasis on the controversies.

Results

Patients may experience pain and lower urinary tract symptoms for a long time before diagnosis, affecting their mental health and work, causing stress, sleep disturbance, depression, and sexual dysfunction. BPS has been considered as one of a group of chronic pain syndromes rather than as primarily an inflammatory bladder disorder. Despite the wide range of treatments, most are empirical and inadequate, usually offering just symptom relief. There is often delay in commencing treatment, and this may result in worse prognosis.

Conclusion

Efforts are focused on different pathways for the early identification of this syndrome, trying to elucidate the pathogenetic mechanism, as well as introducing effective treatments.

### When is azoospermic infertility treatable without intracytoplasmic sperm injection? [^116MiE6r]. Clinical Endocrinology (2013). Low credibility.

Infertility with azoospermia requires a diligent search for reversible factors and treatment to restore natural fertility, even though most cases are due to untreatable primary spermatogenic failure and are destined to require consideration of assisted reproductive treatment (ART) options. Complete clinical and diagnostic evaluation is essential for avoiding both unnecessary ART and overlooking important co-morbidities. Gonadotrophin deficiency is the most treatable cause, resulting from drug effects or congenital or acquired disease, and medical therapy is highly efficacious. A range of uncommon endocrinocrinopathies may also result in reversible azoospermia. Finally, obstructive azoospermia may be surgically remediable in selected cases.

4.6 Limitations

The committee recognizes limitations related to individual committee members' personal bias, the inherent lack of outcome reliability studies and the lack of a gold standard comparison for the various outcomes. The methodology did not employ a systematic review and rating of the evidence as required by GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) methodology, but rather a comprehensive review and discussion of the literature based on expertise, experience and expert group consensus feedback. The role of cystoscopy, urodynamics, and pain mapping (considered by some as possible non‐PRO outcomes) has been addressed by the Diagnosis and Phenotype IC/BPS consensus meeting committees and have not been addressed by this PRO committee. The impact of trial design (inclusion/exclusion criteria) on research outcomes are also beyond the scope of this committee.

### Targeting the SHIP1 pathway fails to show treatment benefit in interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: lessons learned from evaluating potentially effective therapies in this enigmatic syndrome [^114WaSj8]. The Journal of Urology (2019). Medium credibility.

Purpose

In this 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter, 3-arm, parallel group, phase 3 trial we assessed the effects of a novel SHIP1 activator on bladder pain and urinary symptoms in patients with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome.

Materials and Methods

Subjects with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome and a mean pain score of 5 or greater on an 11-point scale despite treatment were randomized to 100 or 200 mg of an oral SHIP1 activator or placebo once daily for 12 weeks. Maximum pain scores and urinary frequency were recorded in an e-diary. The ICSI (O'Leary-Sant Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Index) and BPIC-SS (Bladder Pain Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Score) questionnaires were administered. Safety was monitored through 12 weeks of treatment.

Results

A total of 298 female subjects with moderate to severe symptoms of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome were treated with 100 or 200 mg SHIP1 activator orally once daily for 12 weeks. Treatment demonstrated no difference in maximum daily bladder pain compared to placebo. There was no treatment benefit over that of placebo in the secondary end points of urinary voiding frequency, the BPIC-SS, the ICSI and a global response assessment. Exploratory analysis in 87 male subjects yielded a similar result, that is no difference from placebo. Treatment was generally well tolerated at both doses.

Conclusions

SHIP1 activation is a safe but ineffective therapeutic approach to interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. Although this was a negative trial, the important lessons learned from this study in respect to inflammatory phenotype differentiation, including the potential importance of cystoscopy based classification, will improve current treatment in patients with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome and allow for better future trial design in those with this difficult urological chronic pain syndrome.

It is increasingly recognized that the bladder is the originator of storage lower urinary tract symptoms, including overactive bladder in men. As these symptoms are most bothersome for patients, there has been an increasing interest in the evaluation of drug treatment to better target the bladder. Consequently, several new drug classes have been introduced to the therapeutic armamentarium. Antimuscarinics, which were previously avoided due to the concern regarding urinary retention, are now used in routine practice; however, their use is still hampered by discontinuation due to side effects.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^112YSyTY]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) pain management — analgesic selection and titration: It is important that the patient understand that finding the medication or combination of medications that provide effective pain control requires a "trial and error" method of prescribing. The efficacy of each analgesic administered should be determined and only one drug should be titrated at a time; otherwise it is not possible to assess the effects of a certain drug on pain scores. The starting dose should always be the smallest available and titration should occur at frequent intervals, guided by pain scores and side effects, and this requires frequent contact between the patient and the clinician. It is important for the patient and the prescribing clinician to understand that some side effects actually improve as the patient continues to take the drug for several weeks, and if these side effects are not intolerable, then the patient should be guided through this period. Patients and clinicians should be aware that 100% pain relief is often not achievable; the focus of pain management is to minimize discomfort and maximize the patient's ability to function in daily life.

Self-care practices and behavioral modifications that can improve symptoms should be discussed and implemented as feasible (Clinical Principle). Patients should be encouraged to implement stress management practices to improve coping techniques and manage stress-induced symptom exacerbations (Clinical Principle).

Prepregnancy counseling — review of current medications — advises that all prescription and nonprescription medications should be reviewed, including nutritional supplements and herbal products, with discussion of the pregnancy safety of each and detailed review of medications with potential teratogenicity and their specific risks. The importance of reliable contraception should be emphasized when a patient is taking potentially teratogenic medications, and for a patient who desires pregnancy such medication should be adjusted in collaboration with the prescribing health care provider before contraception is discontinued, using the lowest effective doses of the safest medications whenever medically reasonable. Male partners should be screened for the use of androgens, such as testosterone, because androgen use is associated with azoospermia and infertility in males, which may be reversible in some cases with cessation.

Hydroxyzine (Evidence Strength: Grade C) — In one randomized controlled trial, more patients in the treatment group (23%) experienced clinically significant improvement than in the placebo group (13%) after six months of oral hydroxyzine (10 mg daily titrated to 50 mg daily over several weeks if tolerated), but this difference was not statistically significant. One observational study reported 92% clinically significant improvement with 25 mg daily titrated up to 75 mg daily over several weeks. AEs were common (up to 82% of patients) but generally not serious and were similar in proportion between placebo and treatment groups; the Panel interpreted the disparate findings to indicate uncertainty regarding the balance between benefits/ risks/ burdens.

### Are all α-blockers created equal? An update [^112GgYAt]. Urology (2002). Low credibility.

alpha-Receptor blockers, used to treat lower urinary tract symptoms, exert effects on areas of the body other than the prostate where alpha-receptors are located, including the blood vessels and the central nervous system. alpha-Receptors in the central and peripheral nervous system may be involved in bladder activation. alpha(1a)-Receptors are the appropriate target in men with obstructive symptoms, although alpha(1d)-receptors may also be important in patients with irritative symptoms. There is conflicting evidence about the selectivity of alpha-blockers. Clinical trials of these agents do not necessarily reflect results observed in animal and laboratory studies on uroselectivity. The few published comparator studies of alpha-blockers indicate similar efficacies, although side-effect profiles differ somewhat. Randomized, controlled studies of different alpha-blockers with sufficient power to detect differences in side effects between agents are needed.

AUA/SUFU guideline on idiopathic overactive bladder — evidence nomenclature and recommendation grades are defined in Table 2 as follows: Strong Recommendation corresponds to "Benefits > Risks/Burdens (or vice versa)" with "Net benefit (or net harm) is substantial", applies "to most patients in most circumstances", and varies by evidence strength such that for A "future research is unlikely to change confidence", for B "better evidence could change confidence", and for C "better evidence is likely to change confidence (rarely used to support a Strong Recommendation)". Moderate Recommendation maintains "Benefits > Risks/Burdens (or vice versa)" with "Net benefit (or net harm) is moderate", applies "to most patients in most circumstances", and for A "future research is unlikely to change confidence", for B "better evidence could change confidence", and for C the benefit "appears moderate" with "better evidence is likely to change confidence". Conditional Recommendation uses "Benefits = Risks/Burdens", where the "Best action depends on individual patient circumstances"; for A "Future Research is unlikely to change confidence", for B "Better evidence could change confidence", and for C "Balance between Benefits & Risks/Burdens unclear", "Net benefit (or net harm) comparable to other options", and "Alternative strategies may be equally reasonable" with "Better evidence likely to change confidence". Additional statement types are defined: Clinical Principle is "a statement about a component of clinical care that is widely agreed upon by urologists or other clinicians for which there may or may not be evidence in the medical literature", and Expert Opinion is "a statement, achieved by consensus of the Panel, that is based on members' clinical training, experience, knowledge, and judgment for which there may or may not be evidence in the medical literature".

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^116C2fyG]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) pharmacologic pain management — overall approach: The goal of pharmacotherapy is to find medication/medications that provide significant pain relief with minimal side effects. Pain management tools include urinary analgesics, NSAIDs, narcotics, and a wide variety of nonnarcotic medications used for chronic pain which have been "borrowed" from the treatment of depression, epilepsy, arrhythmias, etc. Given the current state of knowledge, pharmacological pain management principles for IC/BPS should be similar to those for management of other chronic pain states, and non-opioids alternatives to manage pain should be used preferentially. In addition, effective treatment of symptom flares may require a pain treatment protocol with some flexibility to manage flare-related breakthrough pain. Due to the global opioid crisis, the judicious use of chronic opioids is advised and only after informed decision-making with the patients and with periodic follow-ups to assess efficacy, adverse side effects, compliance, and potential of abuse or misuse.

### Second multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group evaluation of effectiveness and safety of intravesical sodium chondroitin sulfate compared with inactive vehicle control in subjects with interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^112wdUM8]. Urology (2012). Low credibility.

Objective

To gain additional safety and effectiveness information regarding intravesical 2% chondroitin sulfate in subjects with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) in a controlled clinical trial.

Methods

Women with IC/BPS were randomized to receive either 8 weekly bladder instillations of 20 mL of 2% chondroitin sulfate or 20 mL of inactive control solution. The primary effectiveness endpoint was the number of positive results using the Global Response Assessment at week 11 (4 weeks after the last instillation). The secondary effectiveness endpoint was a positive response to the Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Index (ICSI) at week 11. Additional effectiveness endpoints were changes from baseline at week 11 in the total ICSI score voiding diary, and visual analog scale for pain.

Results

A total of 98 eligible women with a diagnosis of IC/BPS met the inclusion criteria and were the intention to treat population. Of the 98 women, 83% completed the study. More patients in the chondroitin sulfate group (38.0%) reported moderate or marked improvement (considered responders) compared with the inactive control group (31.3%) at the 11-week endpoint visit. Similarly, more subjects in the active treatment group were classified as ICSI and VAS pain responders and reported a greater decrease in ICSI and VAS pain scores than the control group. None of these differences were statistically significant.

Conclusion

Intravesical chondroitin sulfate therapy for IC/BPS might result in minor improvements in IC/BPS-related symptom and pain. However, the magnitude of benefit in our small pilot study does not support its use as monotherapy for this condition. Better strategies for selecting patients with a bladder-specific clinical phenotype might improve the overall response to this type of intravesical therapy.

### Current updates relating to treatment for interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^114CDZT7]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Conclusions

In patients with IC, therapy is not straightforward. The current work has led to the recognition of a therapeutic combination for this condition that could be anticipated to have a positive clinical outcome. It was established that ongoing therapy is of value, and that the efficacy of treatments is diminished in individuals of advancing years. Additional RCTs are required to ascertain the efficacy of combined therapeutic approaches, such as immunomodulatory compounds, intravesical injection or instillation with BTX or HA, or HA and CS and diet modification.

### Fulranumab in patients with interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: observations from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study [^116QkZx1]. BMC Urology (2017). Low credibility.

Background

This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fulranumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against nerve growth factor (NGF), for pain relief in patients with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS).

Methods

In this multicenter, double-blind study, adults with IC/BPS (i.e. interstitial cystitis symptom index [ICSI] total score ≥ 8) accompanied by chronic, moderate-to-severe pain were randomized to fulranumab 9 mg or matching placebo, administered subcutaneously at weeks 1, 5, and 9. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline to study endpoint (week 12 or at withdrawal) in average daily pain intensity score. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline to study endpoint in worst pain intensity score, ICSI total score, Pelvic Pain and Urgency/Frequency total score, Patient Perception of Bladder Condition score, and global response assessment.

Results

This study was terminated prematurely based on concern that this class may be associated with rapidly progressing osteoarthritis or osteonecrosis. Thirty-one patients (of the targeted 70 patients) were randomized, 17 to placebo and 14 to fulranumab, with 15 and 10 patients, respectively, receiving all 3 doses of double-blind treatment. In ANOVA analyses, there was no statistically significant difference between treatment groups for the primary endpoint (LS mean difference [95% CI] vs. placebo, −0.2 [−1.52, 1.10]) or any of the secondary endpoints. Fulranumab was well tolerated, with no patient discontinuing due to an adverse event or experiencing a joint-related serious adverse event over a 26-week follow-up period. No events related to the neurologic or motor systems were reported.

Conclusions

Efficacy was not demonstrated in the present study with the single dose tested and a limited sample size, leading to lack of statistical power. These findings do not exclude the possibility that fulranumab would provide clinical benefit in a larger study and/or specific populations (phenotypes) in this difficult to treat pain condition.

### The AUA / SUFU guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of idiopathic overactive bladder [^112xwVrk]. The Journal of Urology (2024). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU Guideline on Overactive Bladder — treatment framework and differential diagnosis: The evidence base used to support this guideline did not favor stepwise "first"→"second"→"third line therapy", and to eliminate the concept of "step therapy", options are grouped by invasiveness with an emphasis on shared decision-making to select therapies based on the patient's needs, desires, and side effect tolerance; there are eight treatment categories: incontinence management strategies, behavioral therapies, optimization of co-morbidities, non-invasive therapies, pharmacologic therapies, minimally invasive therapies, invasive therapies, and indwelling catheters, and patients may select from multiple categories simultaneously. Differential diagnosis and contributors include that interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome shares urinary frequency and urgency with or without UUI, but bladder and/or pelvic pain, including dyspareunia, is crucial; genitourinary syndrome of menopause can contribute to urgency and incontinence symptoms and there is some evidence for improvement with vaginal (but not systemic) estrogen; urinary tract infection can mimic OAB but is generally acute, shorter in duration, accompanied by cues such as dysuria or suprapubic discomfort, and resolves with antibiotics; and lower urinary tract symptoms related to neurological conditions such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis are considered neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction and not idiopathic OAB. Patients with prostates experience OAB nearly as often as those without and may be underdiagnosed and undertreated; some have both benign prostatic hyperplasia and OAB, while others have OAB alone and would benefit from diagnosis specific treatment. Because the term "refractory OAB" lacks a clear definition and consensus, the guideline has refrained from using it.

### Etiology and management of chronic pelvic pain syndrome in men [^113LYXJr]. Urology (2004). Low credibility.

Prostatitis results in > 2 million physician office visits annually. Characterized by pelvic pain and voiding symptoms, chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) is poorly defined. The Chronic Prostatitis Collaborative Research Network (CPCRN) has put forward a uniform set of classifications for chronic prostatitis based on pain being the primary symptom. The CPCRN has also created a valid instrument for measuring symptoms: the Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index. After nonbacterial prostatitis has been diagnosed, treatment of patients should be individualized. The condition may be caused by bladder, prostate, pelvic side wall, or seminal vesicle pathology. In addition to currently used treatments, several new therapies are being investigated after promising pilot studies. Despite the multiple approaches to management of CPPS, no hard and fast guidelines have been developed. This review provides an overview of assessment techniques and management options for men with CPPS.

### What is new in bladder pain syndrome / interstitial cystitis? [^117NF36W]. Current Opinion in Urology (2008). Low credibility.

Purpose Of Review

Bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis is an important and poorly understood disorder. This review highlights current research findings that may be of benefit to the clinician who is responsible for the diagnosis and treatment of patients who suffer from this condition.

Recent Findings

The perspective from which we view bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis is evolving, as is apparent in the literature this year. It is best perceived as one of many chronic pain syndromes, some of which may be related. International efforts aimed at consistent definition and nomenclature are ongoing. Some new treatments have been reported that may be of benefit.

Summary

In the age of the internet, it is incumbent upon the clinician to keep up with current ideas, epidemiology, and treatment findings to be able to discuss these with well informed patients who come to clinics around the world. In this review we hope to bring practicing healthcare providers up to date with the literature on bladder pain syndrome/interstitial cystitis, and the implications for their patients.

### Management of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: a urology perspective [^115pZCDK]. The Urologic Clinics of North America (2012). Low credibility.

Management of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is individualized for each patient. All patients benefit from education and self-care advice. Patients with Hunner lesions usually respond well to fulguration or triamcinolone injection, which can be repeated when the symptoms and lesions recur. For patients without Hunner lesions, numerous treatment options are available. The tiers of the American Urological Association Guidelines present these options in an orderly progression, balancing the benefits, risks, and burdens. Along with specific IC/BPS treatments, it is also important to have resources for stress reduction, pain management, and treatment of comorbid conditions.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^1146S8pH]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome — treatment categories and evidentiary designations state that most treatments are designated as Options, except for physical therapy in the setting of pelvic floor tenderness (Standard) and triamcinolone injection and/or fulguration of Hunner lesions (Recommendation). The designation of Option reflects the Panel's judgment that uncertainty existed for the balance between benefits and risks/burdens, including that most treatments may benefit a subset not readily identifiable pre‑treatment and that no treatment reliably benefits most or all patients; uncertainty also arises when studies suggest efficacy but total exposure is small (e.g., cimetidine), and for oral PPS, several randomized trials were contradictory, supporting an Option designation. Given limited understanding of pathophysiology and the goal to control symptoms to optimize QoL, the Panel judged that treatments are best presented as clinical choices when some efficacy for some patients was demonstrated and the risk of serious harms was acceptable.

### Updating the evidence on drugs to treat overactive bladder: a systematic review [^116rkbhj]. International Urogynecology Journal (2019). Medium credibility.

Data synthesis

We evaluated the results by examining the clinical and methodological characteristics of the included studies, exploring relationships in the data, and describing patterns across studies in the direction and magnitude of effects. Poor-quality studies were not synthesized with the rest of the evidence. Applicability of the evidence was described using the PICOTS (population, intervention, comparator, outcomes, timing, setting) framework. When outcomes were not reported as relative risk (RR) or odds ratio but provided sufficient data, we calculated these ratios. Meta-analysis was conducted when a sufficient number of studies investigated the same drug dose and were homogeneous enough to justify combining their results. We evaluated outcomes in terms of change from baseline rather than a comparison of end point scores as was done in the prior review. We imputed variance data where necessary. Random effects models were used to estimate pooled effects using pairwise meta-analyses. The I² statistic (the proportion of variation in study estimates due to heterogeneity) was calculated to assess heterogeneity across studies. Potential sources of heterogeneity were examined with subgroup analysis by factors such as study design, study quality, variations in interventions, and patient population characteristics. Meta-analyses were conducted using STATA 10.1 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). Where eight or more studies of a given intervention comparison and outcome were available, publication bias was assessed using funnel plots.

### Diagnosis and treatment of interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome [^113fkj5u]. The Journal of Urology (2022). High credibility.

Amitriptyline (Evidence Strength: Grade B) — One randomized controlled trial using oral amitriptyline 25 mg daily titrated over several weeks to a target 100 mg daily if tolerated was superior to placebo with 63% of the treatment group clinically significantly improved compared to 4% of the placebo group at four months. Two observational studies reported 50% to 64% clinically significant improvement using a similar dosing regimen at up to 19 months of follow-up, but adverse events (AEs) were extremely common (up to 79% of patients). Available data suggest beginning at low doses (e.g., 10 mg) and titrating gradually to 75–100 mg if tolerated is an acceptable dosing regimen. In an additional RCT with a standardized education and behavioral modification program, intention-to-treat success at three months was similar (drug – 55%; placebo – 45%), though among patients titrating to at least 50 mg, improvement was 66% and significantly greater than the placebo group; given AE burden, amitriptyline was designated as an Option.

### Widespread pain phenotypes impact treatment efficacy results in randomized clinical trials for interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: a multidisciplinary approach to the study of chronic pelvic pain network study [^115K81nw]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

1. Introduction

Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) affects 2.9% to 4.2% of the US population. There is a critical lack of effective treatments for the patient's pain and urologic symptoms. In one of the most comprehensive studies of pelvic pain-based disorder, the Multidisciplinary Approach to the Study of Chronic Pelvic Pain (MAPP) Research Network measured and evaluated the importance of diverse clinical and biological factors in the course of the disease treatment and follow-up. This included the extent of widespread pain beyond the pelvis. and associations with other chronic overlapping pain conditions, which occur in 39% of patients with IC/BPS. The MAPP Network implemented a pain body map to identify the extent of pain beyond the pelvic region as an important contributor to IC/BPS symptom severity and lower quality of life. Fundamental differences were noted in participants with localized vs more widespread pain in pain-related brain connectivity (using functional magnetic resonance imaging scans), experimental pain sensitivity (using pressure quantitative sensory testing), and immunological factors.

Recent rapid growth in knowledge about the complexities of the nervous system and advances in functional brain imaginghave supported the concept that widespread pain is often a marker of a central pain pathway dysfunction independent of peripheral pain input. A growing number of clinical trials have explored potential therapies for widespread pain, but almost none have examined its impact on the outcome of trials for specific pain syndromes. The diversity of the potential underlying etiologies for generating and maintaining pain with similar symptomatic expression will likely result in a heterogeneity of patient populations enrolled in clinical trials. This heterogeneity is a problem in validly assessing the potential benefit for therapies known to be efficacious in a population subgroup if that subgroup cannot be identified a priori. These findings suggest that identifying more specific pain profiles of a study population is an important consideration in the design of clinical trials of pain-based disorders. They also raise the question of whether the lack of efficacy for IC/BPS in past trials may be because of the use of heterozygous cohorts that might obscure the treatment benefits for some groups.

### Interventions for treating people with symptoms of bladder pain syndrome: a network meta-analysis [^11751eoz]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2020). Medium credibility.

Background

Bladder pain syndrome (BPS), which includes the condition of interstitial cystitis, is a poorly understood clinical condition for which patients present with varying symptoms. Management of BPS is challenging for both patients and practitioners. At present, there is no universally accepted diagnosis and diverse causes have been proposed. This is reflected in wide-ranging treatment options, used alone or in combination, with limited evidence. A network meta-analysis (NMA) simultaneously comparing multiple treatments may help to determine the best treatment options for patients with BPS.

Objectives

To conduct a network meta-analysis to assess the effects of interventions for treating people with symptoms of bladder pain syndrome (BPS).

Search Methods

We searched the Cochrane Incontinence Specialised Register, which contains trials identified from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL, in the Cochrane Library), MEDLINE, MEDLINE In-Process, MEDLINE Epub Ahead of Print, ClinicalTrials.gov, the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and handsearched journals and conference proceedings (searched 11 May 2018) and the reference lists of relevant articles. We conducted a further search on 5 June 2019, which yielded four small studies that were screened for eligibility but were not incorporated into the review.

Selection Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of interventions for treating adults with BPS. All types of interventions (including conservative, pharmacological and surgical) were eligible.

Data Collection and Analysis

We assessed the risk of bias of included studies using Cochrane's 'Risk of bias' tool. Primary outcomes were the number of people cured or improved, pain, frequency and nocturia. For each outcome, random-effects NMA models were fitted using WinBUGS 1.4. We monitored median odds ratios (ORs) for binary outcomes and mean differences (MDs) for continuous outcomes with 95% credible intervals (Crls). We compared results of the NMA with direct evidence from pairwise meta-analysis of head-to-head trials. We used the CINeMA tool to assess the certainty of evidence for selected treatment categories.

Main Results

We included 81 RCTs involving 4674 people with a median of 38 participants (range 10 to 369) per RCT. Most trials compared treatment against control; few trials compared two active treatments. There were 65 different active treatments, and some comparisons were informed by direct evidence from only one trial. To simplify, treatments were grouped into 31 treatment categories by mode of action. Most studies were judged to have unclear or high risk of bias for most domains, particularly for selection and detection bias. Overall, the NMA suggested that six (proportion cured/improved), one (pain), one (frequency) and zero (nocturia) treatment categories were effective compared with control, but there was great uncertainty around estimates of effect. Due to the large number of intervention comparisons in this review, we focus on three interventions: antidepressants, pentosan polysulfate (PPS) and neuromuscular blockade. We selected these interventions on the basis that they are given 'strong recommendations' in the EAU Guidelines for management of BPS (EAU Guidelines 2019). We found very low-certainty evidence suggesting that antidepressants were associated with greater likelihood of cure or improvement compared with control (OR 5.91, 95% CrI 1.12 to 37.56), but it was uncertain whether they reduced pain (MD -1.27, 95% CrI -3.25 to 0.71; low-certainty evidence), daytime frequency (MD -2.41, 95% CrI -6.85 to 2.05; very low-certainty evidence) or nocturia (MD 0.01, 95% CrI -2.53 to 2.50; very low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence that PPS had improved cure/improvement rates (OR 0.14, 95% CrI 0.40 to 3.35; very low-certainty evidence) or reduced pain (MD 0.42, 95% CrI -1.04 to 1.91; low-certainty evidence), frequency (MD -0.37, 95% CrI -5.00 to 3.44; very low-certainty evidence) or nocturia (MD -1.20, 95% CrI -3.62 to 1.28; very low-certainty evidence). There was evidence that neuromuscular blockade resulted in greater cure or improvement (OR 5.80, 95% CrI 2.08 to 18.30) but no evidence that it improved pain (MD -0.33, 95% CrI -1.71 to 1.03), frequency (MD -0.91, 95% CrI -3.24, 1.29) or nocturia (MD -0.04, 95% CrI -1.35 to 1.27). The certainty of this evidence was always very low.

Authors' Conclusions

We are uncertain whether some treatments may be effective in treating patients with BPS because the certainty of evidence was generally low or very low. Data were available for a relatively large number of trials, but most had small sample sizes and effects of treatments often could not be estimated with precision. An NMA was successfully conducted, but limited numbers of small trials for each treatment category hampered our ability to fully exploit the advantages of this analysis. Larger, more focused trials are needed to improve the current evidence base.

### Human and animal fertility studies in cystinosis reveal signs of obstructive azoospermia, an altered blood-testis barrier and a subtherapeutic effect of cysteamine in testis [^111T6q1o]. Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease (2021). Medium credibility.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cystinosis is an inherited lysosomal storage disorder caused by recessive mutations in the CTNS gene encoding the lysosomal cystine transporter cystinosin. The disease is characterized by lysosomal cystine accumulation in all cells of the body, and initially affects kidneys followed by extra‐renal manifestations in several organs. Depending on the severity and age at presentation, three different phenotypes of cystinosis are distinguished: the most severe infantile form (95% of patients), the juvenile (5%), and the rare adult ocular benign form. Starting from the early 90s of the last century, cystinosis patients are routinely treated by the cystine‐depleting drug cysteamine which delays the progression of kidney disease and postpones or prevents the occurrence of extra‐renal complications. The advent of renal replacement therapy and cysteamine treatment significantly improved survival of cystinosis patients who can now reach adulthood. This prolonged life expectancy revealed several adult manifestations of cystinosis, one of which is infertility of male patients.

Azoospermia is one of the main causes of male infertility, which is for clinical purposes classified into two subtypes: obstructive (OA) and non‐obstructive azoospermia (NOA).OA and NOA are differentiated mainly via testicular volume and secondary sexual characteristics, and biochemically via evaluating the sexual hormonal levels. However, other techniques, such as scrotal ultrasound and evaluation of obstruction markers in the seminal plasma, have recently been put forward as promising novel diagnostic tools.,

While primary hypogonadism is a well‐known extra‐renal complication in cystinosis, azoospermia has been identified as the cause of infertility in male cystinosis patients. However, we demonstrated previously that this azoospermia occurs irrespective of kidney function, cysteamine treatment, and sex hormone levels, which leaves the mechanism of azoospermia yet to be revealed. In addition, as cysteamine can act as a direct spermicide or alter fertility at the hormonal level in animals, its potential detrimental effect in male cystinosis patients has been of concern.

In the present study, we aimed to unravel the origin of azoospermia in cystinosis and the role of cysteamine by performing clinical and mechanistic studies in humans and in a mouse model of cystinosis.

### Current updates relating to treatment for interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome: systematic review and network meta-analysis [^113H3Bg2]. BMC Urology (2024). Medium credibility.

Background

Despite the publication of several meta-analyses regarding the efficacy of certain therapies in helping individuals with interstitial cystitis (IC) / bladder pain syndrome (BPS), these have not provided a comprehensive review of therapeutic strategies. The study aimed to determine the efficacy of various therapies for IC/BPS and identify potential moderating factors using randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Methods

We queried the PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases to identify prospective RCTs using inclusion criteria: 1) patients diagnosed with IC, 2) interventions included relevant treatments, 3) comparisons were a specified control or placebo, 4) outcomes were mean differences for individual symptoms and structured questionnaires. The pairwise meta-analysis and network meta-analysis (NMA) were performed to compare the treatments used in IC/BPS. Hedges' g standardized mean differences (SMDs) were used for improvement in all outcomes using random-effects models. Efficacy outcomes included individual symptoms such as pain, frequency, urgency, and nocturia, as well as structured questionnaires measuring IC/BPS symptoms.

Results

A comprehensive literature search was conducted which identified 70 RCTs with 3,651 patients. The analysis revealed that certain treatments, such as instillation and intravesical injection, showed statistically significant improvements in pain and urgency compared to control or placebo groups in traditional pairwise meta-analysis. However, no specific treatment demonstrated significant improvement in all outcomes measured in the NMA. The results of moderator analyses to explore influential variables indicated that increasing age was associated with increased nocturia, while longer follow-up periods were associated with decreased frequency.

Conclusion

This systematic review and meta-analysis provide insights into the efficacy of various treatments for IC. Current research suggests that a combination of therapies may have a positive clinical outcome for patients with IC, despite the fact that treatment for this condition is not straightforward.

### MAUDE adverse event report: TECO DIAGNOSTICS AZO TEST… [^1145jCnh]. FDA (AccessData) (2018). Low credibility.

Device Problem Incorrect, Inadequate or Imprecise Result or Readings Patient Problem Unspecified Infection Event Date 05/22/2018 Event Type Injury Manufacturer Narrative. On 6/4/2018 a mailer was sent to the consumer to return any unused portion of the product. To date the item has not been received by ihealth. Based on the timeline the consumer reported, it appears that he had the urine culture performed the same day as the dipstick, thus there was. no delay in treatment and no adverse outcome related to the false negative result. The product insert clearly states the limitations of the test and the need to consult a physician for persistent symptoms. Thus, this consumer did not undergo any adverse experience as a direct result of using the product, and thus there is no relationship between this adverse event. and use of the product.

Additionally, although the patient denies having a blood culture, he did mention "unspecified blood tests" and was diagnosed with "gram negative bacteremia, " a diagnosis that can only be obtained via blood culture. It is likely he had a urine culture at and a blood culture at the hospital as an inpatient. His past and current medical history is significant for diabetes, hypertension, parathyroidectomy, pacemaker placement, cardiac stents, unspecified heart valve replacements, and carotid endarterectomy. The consumer was a poor historian and was unable to provide precise details of his adverse experience. The consumer used azo. test strips one time on 2018 because he was experiencing painful urination, "urination blockage, " and "urination leakage. " the strip showed a negative result. He called his physician who suggested using a "different" product. The second product produced a positive result. The consumer went to the emergency room., from where he was admitted to the hospital for five days. He stated that his hospital diagnosis and treatment were for gram negative bacteremia. While hospitalized, he received intravenous antibiotics, and a foley catheter was placed. Tests performed were a transesophageal echocardiogram, another unspecified echocardiogram, an unspecified computed tomography scan, and unspecified bloodwork. Results of these tests were unremarkable. The hospital physician recommended a doppler scan of his carotid arteries, but the consumer refused. He was released from the hospital with a prescription for oral antibiotics. At the time of the telephone contact, the patient was "feeling better".
