## Question

What is the role of angiogenesis in the development of venous malformations?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the role of angiogenesis in the development of venous malformations. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the definition and classification of venous malformations to anchor the discussion. Then, I should verify the genetic drivers and the signaling pathways they activate. Next, I will examine whether angiogenesis is required for initiation and progression, and whether it is pathological or adaptive. After that, I need to check the cellular mechanisms, especially venous endothelial clonal expansion and competitive behavior. Finally, I will integrate these findings into a coherent model and consider therapeutic implications that target angiogenesis or related circuits, making sure I distinguish venous malformations from arteriovenous malformations where the biology differs.

> Let me first confirm the clinical entity and classification so I don't conflate entities. Venous malformations are slow-flow vascular anomalies characterized by abnormally enlarged, tortuous venous channels with sparse, irregular smooth muscle coverage; they are congenital errors of vascular morphogenesis that grow with the patient and do not involute, distinguishing them from vascular tumors like infantile hemangioma, which do involute [^c60cc00f] [^06d8475b].

> I need to verify the genetic drivers and their frequency. The two most common causal genes are TEK (encoding TIE2) and PIK3CA, with TEK mutations accounting for roughly half of sporadic VMs and PIK3CA mutations for about a quarter to a third, depending on the cohort; both lead to hyperactivation of the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway, with TEK mutations often showing ligand-independent receptor activation and PIK3CA mutations directly activating the kinase [^a208c8ee] [^d7458a05] [^684ed062] [^d1ca5d78].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about angiogenesis being the primary driver without checking whether it is required for lesion formation. Initially, I thought angiogenesis might be dispensable because Pik3ca-driven cutaneous VMs can form in adult, quiescent dermis and are not blocked by VEGF neutralization, which would suggest angiogenesis-independent growth. Wait, let me verify that interpretation. The same studies show that while established lesions may be less VEGF-dependent, early lesion development still reflects proliferative, angiogenic remodeling of venous endothelium, and venous ECs are the principal source of angiogenic expansion in development and disease, so angiogenesis is indeed involved, albeit with vessel-type–specific mechanisms that differ from classic VEGF-driven sprouting angiogenesis [^f92af611] [^7f7441e0] [^25adab45].

> Next, I should review the cellular mechanisms to ensure I'm precise. VMs arise from clonal expansion of mutant venous endothelial cells rather than recruitment of wild-type ECs; TIE2-mutant ECs competitively inhibit wild-type EC sprouting and migration via overexpression of semaphorins 3A and 3F, which act as chemorepellents, thereby enabling mutant ECs to dominate the lesion and drive lumen enlargement. Let me double-check the magnitude of this effect; xenograft models show that lesional vessels are lined almost exclusively by mutant ECs, with wild-type ECs comprising only a tiny fraction, confirming a clonal expansion model rather than recruitment [^831618a6] [^a28c5657] [^3435221e].

> I will now examine the signaling circuitry that links angiogenesis to VM growth. In PIK3CA-driven VMs, excessive PI3Kα activity suppresses FOXO1, which normally induces ANGPT2, while simultaneously promoting ANGPT1 production by recruited smooth muscle cells; this shifts the TIE2 ligand balance toward agonism, amplifying TIE2 signaling in venous ECs and fueling venous overgrowth. Let me verify that this is a feedforward loop; yes, multiple independent studies converge on a PI3K–FOXO1–ANGPT–TIE2 circuit as a core driver of venous-specific pathology [^ff4f6772] [^4bbe5d34] [^de50cf4d].

> But wait, what if the venous identity itself predisposes to this pathology? I should confirm whether venous ECs have unique angiogenic properties. Fate-mapping and single-cell studies show venous ECs are the primary source of angiogenic expansion in development and disease, with a capacity to migrate against flow and differentiate into other endothelial subtypes; in VMs, this venous-specific angiogenic competence likely lowers the threshold for clonal expansion and structural remodeling once PI3K–TIE2 signaling is perturbed [^7f7441e0] [^9fee8bf7] [^25adab45].

> Let me consider the therapeutic implications, and I should double-check that they align with the biology. mTOR inhibition with sirolimus can stabilize symptoms and slow progression in some VMs, but responses are variable and often limited in advanced lesions; targeting upstream TIE2 signaling or ligand imbalance has shown superior suppression of established lesions in preclinical models, and combination strategies such as TIE2 inhibition plus rapamycin, or ABL kinase inhibition combined with rapamycin, have induced regression in murine models, supporting the concept that modulating angiogenic and growth signaling can reverse VM growth when timed appropriately [^f2c0603b] [^ff4f6772] [^a8264560] [^e51dbbed] [^4a8bfccc].

> I should confirm that I'm not conflating VMs with AVMs, where the biology differs. AVMs are fast-flow lesions driven by distinct pathways such as KRAS–MEK/ERK and TGFβ/BMP signaling defects, with venous ECs contributing to abnormal arteriovenous connections; while angiogenesis is implicated, the hemodynamic and genetic drivers are not identical to VMs, so extrapolating anti-angiogenic strategies from AVMs to VMs would be misleading without evidence [^fca76112] [^daf78d72] [^1678fc9e].

> Putting this together, I need to ensure the model is coherent. Angiogenesis in VMs is pathological and driven by clonal expansion of mutant venous endothelial cells with a competitive advantage, sustained by a PI3K–TIE2 feedforward circuit that amplifies venous-specific growth programs; while VEGF blockade may not halt established lesions, early modulation of TIE2 signaling or combined pathway inhibition can suppress growth, indicating that angiogenesis is both a mechanistic driver and a therapeutic target in VMs [^ff4f6772] [^831618a6] [^f92af611].

Angiogenesis is central to venous malformation (VM) pathogenesis, driven by **clonal expansion of mutant venous endothelial cells** [^831618a6] that overexpress semaphorins 3A/3F to repel wild-type cells and enlarge lumens [^a6aa71b4]. VMs arise from somatic mutations in **TIE2 or PIK3CA** [^a208c8ee] [^d7458a05], which hyperactivate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and TIE2 pathways [^b65f6d9f], increasing endothelial proliferation, migration, and vessel dilation [^d7458a05] [^2b69985b]. This angiogenic drive explains lesion growth and recurrence, and provides the rationale for **anti-angiogenic therapies** such as sirolimus [^f2c0603b] and TIE2/PI3K inhibitors [^ff4f6772] [^e51dbbed].

---

## Genetic drivers of angiogenesis in VMs

- **TIE2 mutations**: The most common cause of VMs [^a208c8ee]; TIE2-L914F causes ligand-independent receptor activation and downstream PI3K/AKT signaling, promoting endothelial survival, proliferation, and migration [^2b69985b].

- **PIK3CA mutations**: Found in ~20–30% of VMs [^684ed062]; these mutations hyperactivate PI3K/AKT/mTOR, increasing angiogenesis and vessel dilation [^d7458a05].

- **Other pathways**: RAS/MAPK/ERK and GPCR signaling are also implicated, though less commonly [^265b3777] [^0210f01e].

---

## Molecular mechanisms of angiogenesis in VMs

- **Clonal expansion of mutant venous endothelial cells**: TIE2-mutant ECs outcompete wild-type ECs via semaphorin 3A/3F–mediated repulsion, driving lumen enlargement and lesion growth [^831618a6] [^a6aa71b4].

- **Imbalance in TIE2 ligands**: Reduced ANGPT2 (antagonist) and increased ANGPT1 (agonist) amplify TIE2 signaling, promoting venous overgrowth [^ff4f6772] [^4bbe5d34].

- **Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling**: HIF-1α is upregulated in VM ECs, inducing VEGF and other pro-angiogenic factors that sustain angiogenesis [^a1430ab9].

---

## Clinical implications of angiogenesis in VMs

- **Lesion growth and recurrence**: Persistent angiogenesis explains why VMs enlarge with the patient and recur after incomplete treatment [^c60cc00f].

- **Symptoms**: Pain, swelling, and bleeding reflect ongoing angiogenesis and vessel dilation [^notfound].

- **Therapeutic targets**: Anti-angiogenic strategies such as sirolimus (mTOR inhibitor) [^f2c0603b], TIE2 inhibitors [^ff4f6772], and PI3K inhibitors [^684ed062] are effective in selected patients [^85a16c22].

## Therapeutic strategies targeting angiogenesis

| **Therapy** | **Mechanism** | **Clinical evidence** |
|-|-|-|
| Sirolimus (rapamycin) | mTOR inhibition | - Reduces pain, swelling, and lesion size [^f2c0603b] <br/> - Effective in complex VMs [^24a8dc4a] |
| TIE2 inhibitors (e.g. rebastinib) | Block TIE2 signaling | - Suppresses VM growth in preclinical models [^ff4f6772] <br/> - Case reports show clinical benefit [^8207129e] |
| PI3K inhibitors (e.g. alpelisib) | Inhibit PI3K/AKT/mTOR | - Preclinical regression of PIK3CA-driven VMs [^684ed062] <br/> - Clinical trials underway [^notfound] |
| Combination therapies (e.g. ponatinib + rapamycin) | Dual inhibition of TIE2 and mTOR | - Induces regression in murine models [^e51dbbed] <br/> - Awaiting clinical validation |

Angiogenesis is a **core driver of VM pathogenesis**, fueled by mutant venous endothelial cells and dysregulated TIE2/PI3K signaling [^b65f6d9f]. Targeting these pathways offers a disease-modifying strategy beyond surgery and sclerotherapy [^0210f01e].

Background

Angiogenesis is a dynamic process that involves expansion of a preexisting vascular network that can occur in a number of physiological and pathological settings. Despite its importance, the origin of the new angiogenic vasculature is poorly defined. In particular, the primary subtype of endothelial cells (capillary, venous, arterial) driving this process remains undefined.

Methods

Endothelial cells were fate-mapped with the use of genetic markers specific to arterial and capillary cells. In addition, we identified a novel venous endothelial marker gene (Gm5127) and used it to generate inducible venous endothelium-specific Cre and Dre driver mouse lines. Contributions of these various types of endothelial cells to angiogenesis were examined during normal postnatal development and in disease-specific setting.

Results

Using a comprehensive set of endothelial subtype-specific inducible reporter mice, including tip, arterial, and venous endothelial reporter lines, we showed that venous endothelial cells are the primary endothelial subtype responsible for the expansion of an angiogenic vascular network. During physiological angiogenesis, venous endothelial cells proliferate, migrating against the blood flow and differentiating into tip, capillary, and arterial endothelial cells of the new vasculature. Using intravital 2-photon imaging, we observed venous endothelial cells migrating against the blood flow to form new blood vessels. Venous endothelial cell migration also plays a key role in pathological angiogenesis. This was observed both in formation of arteriovenous malformations in mice with inducible endothelium-specific Smad4 deletion mice and in pathological vessel growth seen in oxygen-induced retinopathy.

Conclusions

Our studies establish that venous endothelial cells are the primary endothelial subtype responsible for normal expansion of vascular networks, formation of arteriovenous malformations, and pathological angiogenesis. These observations highlight the central role of the venous endothelium in normal development and disease pathogenesis.

Increased understanding of the mechanisms of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis has provided a glimpse at some of the molecules involved in the pathophysiology of hemangiomas and vascular malformations. This review focuses on recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of angiogenesis/lymphangiogenesis and the differentiation of arterial, venous, and lymphatic vessels. We integrate this knowledge with new data obtained from genetic studies in humans, which have revealed a number of heretofore-unsuspected candidates involved in the development of familial vascular anomalies. We present a common infantile vascular tumor, hemangioma, and then focus on hereditary familial vascular and lymphatic malformations. We also summarize transgenic mouse models for some of these malformations. It seems reasonable to believe that novel therapeutic strategies will soon emerge for the treatment of hemangiomas and vascular malformations.

Introduction

The term angiogenesis refers to the process of expansion of a preexisting vascular network. It requires the precise control and coordination of the proliferation, migration, and differentiation of endothelial cells (ECs). Endothelial cells can be categorized into several subtypes depending on the type of blood vessels they are found in and on their anatomic location. The three principal types of blood endothelial cells are arterial, venous, and capillary cells, and lymphatic endothelial cells form a distinctly different endothelial subpopulation –. In addition to these well-defined endothelial populations, there is also a population of endothelial tip cells. These cells are characterized by both their specific location at the front of the forming vascular network and the expression of specific genetic programs. Unlike arterial, venous, and capillary endothelial populations, the tip cell population is transient, and any endothelial cells at the vascular edge may assume tip cell features –.

Because these different endothelial subtypes are exposed to distinct local microenvironments, including factors such as oxygen level, nutrients, and mechanical forces, from the flow of blood, it is not surprising that each endothelial subtype has a distinct gene expression pattern. Other factors, such as functional specialization (e.g. filtration vs. barrier function) or anatomic location (e.g. liver vs. brain), also have a distinct genetic imprint. Given this endothelial diversity, the source of endothelial cells responsible for angiogenic vasculature expansion remains poorly defined.

A recent studyreported that venous endothelial cells are the primary source of endothelial cells responsible for angiogenic expansion both during embryonic development and in disease settings. Remarkably, venous endothelial cells are the only type of endothelial subtype capable of responding to hypoxia-induced angiogenic signaling by proliferating and migrating against the blood flow to form the new vascular bed. Abnormalities in this process account for pathological abnormalities, such as arteriovenous malformation (AVM) or excessive angiogenesis, that are seen in diabetic retinopathy.

Several recent observations also suggest that the role of venous endothelial cells is conserved throughout different settings and species. Given that venous endothelial cells are the primary cellular source of angiogenesis, a better understanding of their biological features will help to facilitate the development of pro- and antiangiogenic therapies. In this review, we will provide a summary of recent advances in this field that focus on endothelial migration and the primary angiogenic role played by the venous endothelium.

### Molecular landscape and classification of vascular anomalies [^fc836f42]. Hematology: American Society of Hematology. Education Program (2024). Medium credibility.

Vascular malformations, which result from anomalies in angiogenesis, include capillary, lymphatic, venous, arteriovenous, and mixed malformations and affect specific vessel types. Historically, treatments such as sclerotherapy and surgery have shown limited efficacy in complicated cases. Most vascular malformations occur sporadically, but some can be inherited. They result from mutations similar to oncogenic alterations, activating pathways such as PI3K-AKT-mTOR or Ras-MAPK-ERK. Recognizing these parallels, we highlight the potential of targeted molecular inhibitors, repurposing anticancer drugs for the treatment of vascular malformations. This case-based review explores recent developments in precision medicine for slow-flow and fast-flow vascular malformation.

Recent clinical and experimental evidence has challenged the traditional concept of the venous system as a "passive" element in the genesis and evolution of intracranial vascular malformations. The authors review the clinical and experimental evidence linking the venous system and its anomalies to the genesis of various intracranial vascular malformations, including dural arteriovenous fistulas, cavernous malformations, parenchymal arteriovenous malformations, and capillary telangiectasia. They also describe the potential significance of different associations of these vascular anomalies.

Venous endothelial cells and pathological angiogenesis

In addition to serving a useful physiological role by restoring tissue perfusion, angiogenesis also plays a key role in the progression of various diseases, including cancer and various retinopathies. However, the source of neo-angiogenic endothelial cells in pathological lesions is poorly understood due to technical limitations. Recent studies have shown that the venous endothelium is the key source of neo-angiogenic endothelial cells during pathological angiogenesis.

Vascular malformations

Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are one of the most widely used models to investigate mechanistic details of endothelial dysfunction in angiogenesis because the mouse AVM model provides a highly detailed view of the AVM structure in the superficial layer of the retinal vasculature. Arteriovenous malformations are a common vascular disorder characterized by an abnormal connection between an artery and a vein (AV shunt). They are caused by loss-of-function mutations of genes in the TGFβ/BMP signaling pathway, including ALK1, ENG, and SMAD4. The key feature of AVM development is a misdirected endothelial alignment. In particular, the loss of endoglin (ENG), a coreceptor of TGFβ/BMP signaling, alters endothelial shapes under blood flow, and vessels with ENG loss developed AV shunts in both zebrafishand mice. Activin receptor-like kinase 1 (Alk1)-deficient endothelial cells also display polarization defects under flowthat also play a role in the development of AVM. SMAD4, a downstream transcription factor of the TGFβ/BMP signaling pathway, is yet another gene involved in the control of endothelial alignment. While normal endothelial cells are polarized and aligned along the axis of the flow, SMAD4-deficient endothelial cells exhibit a lack of alignment and reduced polarization. This observation has also been confirmed in the retinal vasculature in in vivo settings. Misdirected endothelial alignment and polarization result in AVM development in endothelium-specific SMAD4 KO mice (SMAD4 iECKO). While the venous endothelial Golgi complex is polarized toward the retinal periphery in normal mice, those in SMAD4 iECKO mice polarized toward arteries displaying venous endothelial cells. Thus, in SMAD4 iECKO mice, the polarization is abnormally directed (Fig. 7).

### Targeted treatments for vascular malformations: current state of the art [^0210f01e]. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (2024). Medium credibility.

Vascular malformations, which arise from anomalies in angiogenesis, encompass capillary, lymphatic, venous, arteriovenous, and mixed malformations, each affecting specific vessel types. Historically, therapeutic options such as sclerotherapy and surgery have shown limited efficacy in complicated malformations. Most vascular malformations stem from hereditary or somatic mutations akin to oncogenic alterations, activating the PI3K-AKT-mTOR, RAS-MAPK-ERK, and G-protein coupled receptor pathways. Recognizing the parallels with oncogenic mutations, we emphasize the potential of targeted molecular inhibitors in the treatment of vascular malformations by repurposing anticancer drugs. This review delves into the recent development and future use of such agents for the management of slow- and fast-flow vascular malformations, including in more specific situations, such as prenatal treatment and the management of associated coagulopathies.

### Cerebral neurovascular embryology, anatomic variations, and congenital brain arteriovenous lesions [^02a21969]. Journal of Neurointerventional Surgery (2022). Medium credibility.

Cerebral neurovascular development is a complex and coordinated process driven by the changing spatial and temporal metabolic demands of the developing brain. Familiarity with the process is helpful in understanding neurovascular anatomic variants and congenital arteriovenous shunting lesions encountered in endovascular neuroradiological practice. Herein, the processes of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis are reviewed, followed by examination of the morphogenesis of the cerebral arterial and venous systems. Common arterial anatomic variants are reviewed with an emphasis on their development. Finally, endothelial genetic mutations affecting angiogenesis are examined to consider their probable role in the development of three types of congenital brain arteriovenous fistulas: vein of Galen malformations, pial arteriovenous fistulas, and dural sinus malformations.

### Vascular and lymphatic malformations: perspectives from human and vertebrate studies [^06d8475b]. Circulation Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Vascular malformations, affecting ≈1% to 1.5% of the population, comprise a spectrum of developmental patterning defects of capillaries, arteries, veins, and/or lymphatics. The majority of vascular malformations occur sporadically; however, inherited malformations exist as a part of complex congenital diseases. The malformations, ranging from birthmarks to life-threatening conditions, are present at birth, but may reveal signs and symptoms-including pain, bleeding, disfigurement, and functional defects of vital organs-in infancy, childhood, or adulthood. Vascular malformations often exhibit recurrent patterns at affected sites due to the lack of curative treatments. This review series provides a state-of-the-art assessment of vascular malformation research at basic, clinical, genetic, and translational levels.

Fig. 7
Venous endothelial cells and arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).

In a normal vasculature, venous endothelial cells migrate against blood flow toward the angiogenic front for vascular outgrowth. In AVMs, the migration of venous endothelial cells is disturbed, and the speed of migration is accelerated compared to normal venous endothelial cells. Hyperproliferation of misdirected venous endothelial cells results in abnormal connections between arteries and veins.

Growing evidence indicates that venous endothelial cells also play a crucial role in the development of AVMs. For instance, endothelial cells in AV shunt lesions are known to have a venous identity. Venous endothelium marker (EphrinB2)and venous-capillary marker (Endomucin)but not arterial markers (Jag1 and Aplnr) are highly expressed in AV shunt lesions of ENG iECKO mice. AVMs in SMAD4 iECKO and ALK1 iECKO mice also show upregulated expression of venous endothelial markers, including EphrinB2 and Nrp2. Interestingly, deletion of ENG with venous/capillary endothelium-specific Cre (Apj-CreER T2) and pan endothelium-specific Cre (Cdh5-CreER T2) led to a similar incidence and frequency of AVMs, indicating that arterial ENG does not protect AVM development. Likewise, deletion of ALK1 with venous/capillary endothelium-specific Cre (Mfsd2a-CreER T2) leads to AVM development but not tip- (Esm1-CreER T2) or arterial EC (Bmx-CreER T2)-specific deletion. These in vivo findings imply that endothelial cells in capillaries and/or veins are the main drivers of the development of AVMs.

### Review of the endothelial pathogenic mechanism of TIE2-related venous malformation [^6ec5dfb0]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2017). Low credibility.

Background

Venous malformation (VM) is a type of disease involving vascular morphogenesis in humans. Clinically, VM can be sporadic or inherited. TIE2, also known as TEK or HYK, is a member of the receptor tyrosine kinase subfamily and is highly conserved among species. In 1996, an arginine-to-tryptophan substitution at position 849 (R849W) in TIE2 was found to induce hereditary VM. Additional alterations in TIE2 involved in the pathogenesis of inherited or sporadic VM have since been reported.

Methods

The relevant key literature was selectively reviewed, including case reports, reviews, research studies, and meta-analyses.

Results

TIE2 can be thought of as the basis for VM, with a potential role in determining locations, through intracorporal endothelium-specific distribution and expression from the embryonic phase. It has a sophisticated protein structure, and various point mutations destroy its function and physiologic processes by obviously different activation mechanisms, of which some inhibit dephosphorylation and others maintain phosphorylation. Extracellularly, whereas angiopoietins (ANGs) are ligands of TIE2, the chaotic balance between ANG1 and ANG2 in VM is related to their effects on switching between the cell-cell/cell-extracellular matrix contact conditions and vascular quiescence/angiogenesis state, resulting in corrupted contacts. Intracellularly, among diverse cellular pathways, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase/AKT serine-threonine kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinase, and Dok-related protein are irreplaceable keys underlying changes in endothelial morphology and behavioral biology in VM. For example, R849W and L914F (a leucine-to-phenylalanine substitution at position 914), the most important and frequent TIE2 mutations associated with VM, share similar phenotypes but differ with respect to signaling pathways, heredity, and triggering factors.

Conclusions

Based on this comprehensive analysis, we propose an avalanche theory, in which mutant TIE2 is a trigger and pathogenic core, the intercellular network is a tool, altered extracellular matrix and contacts are the final foothold, and fragile contacts are the result. Precise classification according to TIE2 mutation type in VM, especially the mutation site, is important for future targeted therapies.

### Theranostic advances in vascular malformations [^e7f2e3b6]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Vascular malformations are subdivided into capillary, lymphatic, venous, arteriovenous, and mixed malformations, according to the type of affected vessels. Until a few years ago, treatment options were limited to sclerotherapy and/or surgery. Since, it has been demonstrated that the majority of vascular malformations are caused by inherited or somatic mutations in various genes. These mutations lead to hyperactivity of two major signaling pathways: the RAS/mitogen-activated protein kinase and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin pathways. These discoveries paved the way for the development and testing of targeted molecular inhibitors as therapies for vascular anomalies via repurposing of anticancer drugs.

### Parenchymal cues define vegfa-driven venous angiogenesis by activating a sprouting competent venous endothelial subtype [^763f738f]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Tertiary sprout formation requires a specific set of parenchymal derived cues that collectively augment Kdrl signaling strength above the threshold necessary for L-Tip cell selection in the venous domain. A potent Vegfa-Kdrl signal may confer robustness on L-Tip cell selection and escape from the initial flow-induced polarizationtoward a tissue derived growth factor defined orientation, and allowing active angiogenic remodeling. The requirement of two ligands and two receptors allows for a more precise and stringent spatio-temporal control of sprout initiation by the parenchyma when compared to a scenario involving just one ligand/receptor pair. A stringent high threshold may prevent from unproductive venous sprouting in response to any small change in Vegfa expression. Instead, a two-tiered regulation of both Vegfa and Apelin and their respective receptors, may ensure that a sprout is induced only at the exact desired anatomical position in the tissue, the domain where both Vegfa and Apelin are co-expressed. The concept emerging from these observations is that organo-typical features in vascular branching may evolve from the selective coupling of endothelial growth factor receptors and the heterogeneity in the repertoire of parenchymal derived signals that can be used to activate such receptor pairs. We observed coupling of Kdrl and Apelin-receptor-a, but in other scenarios different genetic interactions may exist for example between Kdr/Kdrl/Aplnr with Flt4, Neuropilin (Nrp) and Plexin receptors (Plxn) –, allowing myriad combinations with ligands of the Semaphorin and Vegf family. In a reductionist view, as opposed to the Dll4/Notch tango of the reference model, the choreographed dances in the revised organo-typical scenario may rely on up to four ligand/receptors pairs.

Therapeutic revascularization strategies employing Vegfa have traditionally focused on engineering branching and lumen remodeling of the arterial system. Emerging single cell sequencing analyses however point toward a crucial role for endothelial cells derived from the venous domain in shaping the angio-architecture, in particular in the brain. Yet these systems biology findings await genetic and functional confirmation. Alterations in venous endothelial behavior have been shown to underlie arterial-venous malformations and contribute to the vascular lesions observed during retinopathies. Understanding the molecular framework how parenchymal cues influence Vegfa responsiveness and venous remodeling may help to develop novel therapeutic tools to combat vasculopathies or promote revascularization in ischemic cardiovascular diseases.

### Angiopoietin-TIE2 feedforward circuit promotes PIK3CA-driven venous malformations [^b65f6d9f]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2025). High credibility.

Main

VMs are a chronic disease of the blood vasculature, characterized by localized abnormalities encompassing a spectrum of presentations from superficial, asymptomatic blue or purplish marks to potentially life-threatening lesions. VMs may develop in various tissues, with a high prevalence in the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Classified as 'slow-flow' vascular anomalies, they are characterized by enlarged veins with abnormal smooth muscle cell (SMC) coverage and disrupted blood flow, and are often associated with increased platelet aggregation, coagulation, hemorrhages and swelling.

Most VMs arise from somatic mutations that occur early during development, disrupting normal vessel formation processes. The most common among these are activating mutations in genes encoding the endothelial TIE2 receptor tyrosine kinase (encoded by TEK), or its downstream effector, the lipid kinase PI3Kα (encoded by PIK3CA) –. The TIE2–PI3K signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in blood vessel remodeling during development. TIE2 signaling is also involved in the establishment of venous endothelial identity, as well as the maintenance of vascular stability and homeostasis in adult tissues. These diverse effects are finely balanced by two key TIE2 ligands, angiopoietin 1 (ANGPT1) and angiopoietin 2 (ANGPT2). ANGPT1 is produced by perivascular cells and acts in a paracrine manner as a TIE2 agonist, promoting vascular stability. ANGPT2, on the other hand, is produced by endothelial cells (ECs) themselves and primarily functions as an antagonist that destabilizes blood vessels. In line with this, increased ANGPT2 levels have been associated with blood vessel instability and leakage, contributing to vascular dysfunction in conditions such as sepsis and inflammation, while ANGPT1 prevents blood vessel leakage. Notably, the effects of ANGPT2 are highly context dependent, as in certain situations it can also act as a weak agonist. ANGPT2 can also signal through integrins independently of TIE2 (ref.) and can promote TIE2 interaction with the closely related TIE1 receptor.

### Pathobiology of human cerebrovascular malformations: basic mechanisms and clinical relevance [^75336d10]. Neurosurgery (2004). Low credibility.

Cerebrovascular malformations affect more than 3% of the population, exposing them to a lifetime risk of hemorrhagic stroke, seizures, and focal neurological deficits. Cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs) exhibit an immature vessel wall, a brittle hemorrhagic tendency, and epileptogenesis, whereas arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) lack capillary beds and manifest apoplectic bleeding under high-flow conditions. There are also more benign venous anomalies, capillary malformations, and lesions with mixed and transitional features. Advances have been made toward understanding the natural history, radiological and pathological correlates, and clinical management. Yet, mechanisms of lesion genesis and clinical manifestations remain largely unknown, and the clinical behavior in individual patients is highly unpredictable. Lesion pathogenesis likely involves abnormal assembly or maintenance of blood vessels, resulting in dysmorphic vessel phenotypes. Familial CCM disease is in part caused by mutations in a cytoskeletal-related protein that is likely integral to interendothelial cell connectivity and maturation of the vascular wall. Rare familial forms of AVM disease have been correlated with two different transforming growth factor-beta receptor components, possibly causing disturbance in signaling during vascular assembly. Relevance of these mechanisms to the more common and otherwise identical sporadic CCM and AVM lesions is being explored. In this report, basic mechanisms of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis and how they possibly relate to the common cerebrovascular malformation lesions are reviewed. Novel concepts are discussed related to the cellular, molecular, and genetic substrates in CCM and AVM as well as to how this knowledge can be applied to predict, explain, and possibly modify clinical disease manifestations.

### Semaphorin 3A and 3F promote lumen expansion in TIE2-mutated venous malformation [^a6aa71b4]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2025). Medium credibility.

Highlights

In a xenograft model of venous malformation, blood vessels were lined almost exclusively by mutant endothelial cells (EC) with minimal contribution of wild-type EC.
TIE2 (endothelial tyrosine kinase receptor)-mutant EC promoted repulsion of wild-type EC via overexpression of Sema (semaphorin) 3A and Sema3F.
Knockdown of Sema3A or Sema3F in TIE2-mutant EC normalized the recruitment of wild-type EC and blood vessel size in vivo.

Venous malformations (VMs) are developmental defects of the vasculature, characterized by abnormally enlarged veins. VMs present as blue-colored, compressible lesions and are classified as slow-flow vascular malformations, as proposed by the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies. The prevalence of VM is estimated to be between 1 and 2 in 10,000 births, occurring equally in male and female patients.VMs expand as the child grows, resulting in deformity, severe chronic pain, obstruction of vital organs, bleeding, thrombi, and increased risk of pulmonary embolism.

### Semaphorin 3A and 3F promote lumen expansion in TIE2-mutated venous malformation [^f1cc6f90]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2025). Medium credibility.

While specific TIE2 mutations and increased AKT signaling are linked to the formation and growth of VM, it is still unclear how a mutant EC or progenitor cell can drive the abnormal enlargement of the vascular lumen. An outstanding question in the field is whether mutant EC can promote cell-cell communication with neighboring wild-type (WT) EC, recruiting them to the malformed vessels, or if they can undergo clonal expansion.

Semaphorins are guidance molecules that can regulate cell-cell communication during physiological and pathological angiogenesis and EC migration. Semaphorins act by providing both repulsive and attractive signals, and they play a crucial role during the embryonic development of multiple organ systems including the nervousand the vascular system. Class 3 Semaphorins are secreted guidance molecules that allow for paracrine communication. Semaphorin (Sema)3A and Sema3F exert chemorepellent actions toward EC – and neurons – by signaling through Neuropilin (NRP) and Plexin receptors. Sema3A can inhibit filopodia formation during vascular tip formationand prevent EC integrin–mediated adhesion and vascular remodeling. While dysregulated expression levels of class 3 Semaphorins are associated with pathological angiogenesis, aging-related cardiac dysfunction, and tumor progression, – the role of Sema3A and Sema3F in VM pathogenesis has not yet been explored.

The aim of this study was to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms that contribute to abnormally enlarged VM blood vessels. We, thereby, sought to investigate if Sema3A and Sema3F overexpression acts by regulating the cell-cell communication between TIE2-L914F-mutant EC and WT EC. We used short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)–mediated downregulation of Sema3A or Sema3F and of their NRP receptor, NRP1 or NRP2, and assessed the migration of WT EC toward TIE2-L914F mutant EC in a cell confrontation assay, with time-lapse imaging. Next, we analyzed the role of Sema3A and Sema3F in the sprouting, lumen formation, and lesion expansion in a 3-dimensional (3D) in vitro cell competition assay and in a xenograft model, both obtained by intermixing TIE2-L914F mutant EC with WT EC.

Results

Pik3ca -driven VMs form in skin independently of angiogenesis

We employed a mouse model of Pik3ca H1047R -driven VMs, using the tamoxifen-inducible blood endothelial cell (BEC)-specific Vegfr1-CreER T2 deleter, to investigate the mechanisms controlling VM progression (Fig. 1a). Consistent with our previous findings, expression of the causative Pik3ca H1047R mutation in the ear skin vasculature of 3-week-old juvenile mice resulted in blood-filled vascular lesions (Extended Data Fig. 1a), which progressively grew within endomucin (EMCN)-positive veins and capillaries (Fig. 1b), while lymphatic vessels were unaffected (Extended Data Fig. 1a). Cre − littermate mice treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) and carrying the Pik3ca H1047R allele, used as controls, were also unaffected (Extended Data Fig. 1a).

### Semaphorin 3A and 3F promote lumen expansion in TIE2-mutated venous malformation [^831618a6]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2025). Medium credibility.

BACKGROUND:

Venous malformations (VMs) are developmental defects of the vasculature characterized by tremendously enlarged and dysfunctional veins. Gain-of-function somatic mutations in TIE2 (endothelial tyrosine kinase receptor) have been identified as the leading driver of VM pathogenesis. The aim of this study was to determine whether the aberrant venous lumen expansion is caused by recruitment of wild-type (WT) endothelial cells (EC) to the lesion or by TIE2-mutant EC clonal expansion.

METHODS:

To investigate the contribution of TIE2-mutant EC and WT EC to the aberrant venous lumen expansion, we used a xenograft murine model of VM generated with a combination of TIE2-mutant EC and WT EC. To perform longitudinal studies, we used a 3-dimensional fibrin gel lumen formation assay and a migration assay, both using WT EC in competition or confrontation with TIE2-mutant EC. To investigate the mechanisms implicated in VM lumen expansion, we used RNA-sequencing and short-hairpin RNA silencing in the TIE2-mutant EC.

RESULTS:

We demonstrate here that in the VM xenograft model, the aberrant blood vessels were lined almost exclusively by TIE2-mutant EC, and WT EC were rarely found. Functionally, the TIE2-mutant EC exerted a competitive advantage over WT EC by inhibiting WT EC sprouting. In line with these findings, TIE2-mutant EC promoted repulsion of WT EC. Short-hairpin RNA-mediated silencing of Sema (Semaphorin) 3A or Sema3F in TIE2-mutant EC rescued this chemorepellent phenotype and restored the ability of WT EC to migrate, sprout, and form lumens. Furthermore, knockdown of Sema3A or Sema3F in TIE2-mutant EC normalized the blood vessel size in vivo.

CONCLUSIONS:

Our results demonstrate that WT EC are not recruited to the aberrant veins, suggesting that VM pathogenesis is fueled by clonal expansion of TIE2-mutant EC. Mechanistically, we show that Sema3A and Sema3F are overexpressed in TIE2-mutant EC and play a crucial role in the pathological vascular lumen expansion in VM.

### Effectiveness and safety of sirolimus in the treatment of venous malformations: a meta-analysis of prospective studies [^f2c0603b]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Venous malformations represent the most prevalent type of congenital vascular anomalies. These malformations occur in approximately 1 to 2 per 10,000 newborns and are found in about 1% of the general population. They are characterized by structural irregularities, inflammatory processes, and genetic mutations. The venous walls in these malformations are notably weaker than normal, primarily due to diminished elastic fibers and smooth muscle cells, coupled with defects in connective tissue components. Inflammation plays a critical role, with macrophages accumulating in affected areas and exacerbating the malformation through the secretion of cytokines and growth factors. Genetic investigations have linked some venous malformations to specific mutations, notably in the TIE2 (TEK) gene. Sirolimus is commonly used as an immunosuppressant in organ transplantation and specific disease treatments. It inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, a pivotal protein kinase regulating cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, and protein synthesis. Additionally, sirolimus possesses anti-angiogenic properties, inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation and migration, thereby preventing new blood vessel formation. It further mitigates inflammatory cell activation and cytokine release, thus aiding in managing the inflammatory response associated with venous malformations.

Current treatment strategies for venous malformations include sclerotherapy, laser therapy, surgical resection, and compression therapy, each presenting specific limitations. Sclerotherapy can lead to side effects such as pain, swelling, and skin discoloration. Although laser therapy is effective for small, superficial venous malformations, it is less effective for deep or extensive ones and may result in skin burns or pigmentation. Surgical resection, although it can completely remove the malformation, poses increased risks in cases of extensive or structurally critical malformations. Compression therapy primarily helps alleviate symptoms in limbs but does not decrease malformation size or prevent its progression.

Sirolimus is particularly effective for managing extensive or complex venous malformations that are not amenable to surgical or other physical interventions. Research indicates that sirolimus substantially alleviates pain and exudation in patients with mixed-type malformations. Furthermore, a prospective clinical trial demonstrated significant improvements in complex vascular anomalies and superficial slow-flow vascular malformations among children and adolescents treated with sirolimus. Consequently, this study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sirolimus treatment for venous malformations through a meta-analysis.

### Vascular anomalies: what a radiologist needs to know [^f3eae527]. Pediatric Radiology (2010). Low credibility.

Most haemangiomas and vascular malformations are identified according to clinical criteria. A good knowledge of the classification and clinical characteristics of the vascular anomalies is necessary when managing these patients. However, some cases are challenging either because of an atypical presentation (e.g., soft-tissue mass with normal overlying skin) or because of classification difficulties. Doppler US and MRI are the two main imaging modalities that allow classification of the vascular anomalies and are useful in those clinically uncertain cases to establish the correct diagnosis. This aids the choice of the most appropriate treatment and to inform the parents of the prognosis. High-resolution grey-scale and Doppler US allow excellent visualization of most superficial masses. Doppler US is the easiest way to assess the haemodynamics of a vascular lesion and to clarify a doubtful diagnosis between a haemangioma and vascular malformation. MRI is the best technique for evaluating the extent of the lesions and their relationship to adjacent structures. While newly developed drugs from angiogenesis research labs are awaited, radiologists have an important role in the treatment of haemangiomas and vascular malformations. Intervention remains crucial in cases of alarming haemangiomas and venous malformations (VM), lymphatic malformations (LM) and arteriovenous malformations (AVM). A multidisciplinary team, including paediatricians, haematologists, surgeons and radiologists, must manage the problem cases both in terms of diagnostic work-up and therapeutic options. This paper will briefly discuss the imaging findings and treatment of vascular anomalies.

### Guidelines for the diagnosis and clinical management of cavernous malformations of the brain and spinal cord: consensus recommendations based on a systematic literature review by the alliance to cure cavernous malformation clinical advisory board experts panel [^81283a91]. Neurosurgery (2025). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cavernous malformations:

- **Definition**: CMs, also known as cavernomas, cavernous angiomas, or cavernous hemangiomas, are low-flow vascular lesions composed of abnormally dilated, endothelium-lined capillary spaces without intervening normal brain parenchyma, typically occurring sporadically or as part of an inherited disorder and most commonly located in the cerebral hemispheres, brainstem, or spinal cord.
- **Pathophysiology**: CMs are vascular hamartomas composed of dilated, endothelium-lined sinusoidal channels lacking normal vessel wall architecture, including smooth muscle, tight junctions, and elastic lamina. These lesions are embedded within a collagenous matrix, typically devoid of intervening neural tissue, and often show evidence of slow flow, intralesional thrombosis, calcification, and recanalization. Hemosiderin-laden macrophages are commonly found within and around CMs, reflecting recurrent microhemorrhages and a compromised blood-brain barrier that facilitates erythrocyte extravasation and iron deposition. CMs associated with developmental venous anomalies tend to have a higher propensity for bleeding. Hereditary cerebral CMs result from loss-of-function mutations in KRIT1 (CCM1), CCM2, or PDCD10 (CCM3), which encode proteins forming a cytoskeletal-associated signaling complex involved in vascular stability. Familial forms exhibit autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance. Notably, a founder mutation in CCM1 is observed among many Hispanic patients. The CCM protein complex plays a key role in endothelial function, vasculogenesis, and angiogenesis, although the precise mechanisms linking genetic mutations to lesion formation remain incompletely understood. Emerging evidence also suggests a modulatory role of local immune responses. Oligoclonal IgG bands and specific B-cell receptor clonotypes have been identified in CM lesions, distinct from those in peripheral lymphocytes. Inflammatory infiltrates vary by lesion type, with CD20+ B cells and CD68+ macrophages enriched in lesions associated with venous anomalies, and CD3+ T cells more prominent in sporadic than familial cases. These findings raise the possibility that immunologic mechanisms contribute to lesion behavior, including hemorrhagic risk and growth.
- **Epidemiology**: CMs are relatively common vascular anomalies, with estimated prevalence ranging from 0.16% based on incidental MRI findings to 0.5% in autopsy studies. Prevalence increases with age and is expected to rise further due to broader MRI access. The annual detection rate in adults has been estimated at 0.56 per 100,000 but is likely underestimated in the modern imaging era. CMs can occur sporadically or as part of familial CM, an autosomal dominant condition characterized by multiple lesions and germline mutations. Spinal CMs represent a minority of cases, accounting for roughly 5% of intramedullary lesions in adults and 1% in children.
- **Risk factors**: CMs may occur sporadically or be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern due to mutations in KRIT1, CCM2, or PDCD10. Familial forms are more likely to present with multiple lesions. Additional risk factors include female sex and prior cranial radiation.
- Disease course: CMs often remain clinically silent, with up to 40% of patients asymptomatic. When symptomatic, they typically present between the second and fifth decades of life. Presenting symptoms include seizures in up to 50% of cases, ICH in 25%, and new focal neurological deficits without radiographic evidence of recent hemorrhage in another 25%. Seizures may be secondary generalized (27–70%), complex partial (6–58%), or simple partial (21–44%), and are not confined to any specific cortical region. Headaches (6–52%) and focal deficits (20–45%) such as hemiparesis or diplopia are also common, with wide variation based on lesion location. Brainstem cavernomas produce region-specific symptoms: mesencephalic lesions often cause diplopia, hemiparesis, and ataxia; pontine lesions may present with cranial nerve palsies (V-VIII), hemianesthesia, vertigo, and hemiparesis; and medullary lesions frequently manifest with dysphagia, hemiparesis, and ataxia. Spinal CMs typically cause radiculopathy or myelopathy, with symptoms such as limb weakness, sensory loss, pain, and sphincter dysfunction, evolving acutely, step-wise, or progressively. Many CMs are incidentally discovered on brain MRI performed for unrelated indications.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Prognosis varies depending on lesion location, number, and prior symptomatology. The annual hemorrhage rate is estimated at 0.10% per lesion or 0.25% per patient, but increases substantially for brainstem lesions (up to 4.2% per year) and in those with prior hemorrhage. Seizure risk is estimated at 1.3% per year for solitary lesions and 2.5% for multiple lesions. Larger lesion size and symptom onset before age 35 are associated with higher bleeding risk.

### New and emerging targeted therapies for vascular malformations [^24a8dc4a]. American Journal of Clinical Dermatology (2020). Medium credibility.

Vascular malformations are inborn errors of vascular morphogenesis and consist of localized networks of abnormal blood and/or lymphatic vessels with weak endothelial cell proliferation. They have historically been managed by surgery and sclerotherapy. Extensive insight into the genetic origin and molecular mechanism of development has been accumulated over the last 20 years. Since the discovery of the first somatic mutations in a vascular anomaly 10 years ago, it is now recognized that they are perhaps all caused by inherited or somatic mutations in genes that hyperactivate two major intracellular signaling pathways: the RAS/MAPK/ERK and/or the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PIK3)/protein kinase B/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Several targeted molecular inhibitors of these pathways have been developed, mostly for the treatment of cancers that harbor mutations in the same pathways. The mTOR inhibitor sirolimus is the most studied compound for the treatment of venous, lymphatic, and complex malformations. Disease responses of vascular malformations to sirolimus have now been reported in several studies in terms of clinical changes, quality of life, functional and radiological outcomes, and safety. Other targeted treatment strategies, such as the PIK3CA inhibitor alpelisib for PIK3CA-mutated vascular malformations, are also emerging. Repurposing of cancer drugs has become a major focus in this rapidly evolving field.

### Angiopoietin-TIE2 feedforward circuit promotes PIK3CA-driven venous malformations [^9557d305]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2025). High credibility.

VMs are highly prevalent in the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Susceptibility of the skin to Pik3ca -driven VM formation was recapitulated in mice upon BEC-specific expression of the disease-causative Pik3ca H1047 mutation, highlighting the clinical relevance of the model used in this study. In line with previous findings, we found that the development of cutaneous VM lesions occurred in the absence of developmental growth, and could even be induced in mature quiescent vasculature. Interestingly, we found that VM lesion development was not inhibited by the blockade of the major angiogenic regulator VEGF, suggesting involvement of other growth factors. This is in contrast to cutaneous lymphatic malformations, where the related lymphangiogenic growth factor VEGFC is essential for Pik3ca -driven vessel overgrowth.

Using single-cell transcriptomics, zonation along the AV axis within the dermal microvasculature in both mouse and human data was identified. Conservation of markers in the mouse vasculature, including typical post-capillary venule markers (for example, ICAM1 and SELE) and pre-venular capillary markers (SOX17), was demonstrated, consistent with findings previously reported in human skin. Notably, all venous ECs in our dataset, making up 18% of the total dermal EC population, exhibited a molecular signature typical of post-capillary venules, which are the major sites for leukocyte extravasation. In contrast, the brain vasculature has a similar proportion of venous ECs, but only 3% of the EC population exhibits a post-capillary venous phenotype. This underscores the presence of tissue-specific molecular and functional traits related to immune cell trafficking that may contribute to the unique responsiveness of dermal veins to Pik3ca -driven overgrowth.

### Common and specific effects of TIE2 mutations causing venous malformations [^2b69985b]. Human Molecular Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Venous malformations (VMs) are localized defects in vascular morphogenesis frequently caused by mutations in the gene for the endothelial tyrosine kinase receptor TIE2. Here, we report the analysis of a comprehensive collection of 22 TIE2 mutations identified in patients with VM, either as single amino acid substitutions or as double-mutations on the same allele. Using endothelial cell (EC) cultures, mouse models and ultrastructural analysis of tissue biopsies from patients, we demonstrate common as well as mutation-specific cellular and molecular features, on the basis of which mutations cluster into categories that correlate with data from genetic studies. Comparisons of double-mutants with their constituent single-mutant forms identified the pathogenic contributions of individual changes, and their compound effects. We find that defective receptor trafficking and subcellular localization of different TIE2 mutant forms occur via a variety of mechanisms, resulting in attenuated response to ligand. We also demonstrate, for the first time, that TIE2 mutations cause chronic activation of the MAPK pathway resulting in loss of normal EC monolayer due to extracellular matrix (ECM) fibronectin deficiency and leading to upregulation of plasminogen/plasmin proteolytic pathway. Corresponding EC and ECM irregularities are observed in affected tissues from mouse models and patients. Importantly, an imbalance between plasminogen activators versus inhibitors would also account for high d-dimer levels, a major feature of unknown cause that distinguishes VMs from other vascular anomalies.

### Semaphorin 3A and 3F promote lumen expansion in TIE2-mutated venous malformation [^3435221e]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2025). Medium credibility.

In contrast to these findings in CCM, our study demonstrates that in TIE2-mutant VM, the pathological expansion of the veins is not defined by recruitment of WT EC. Instead, TIE2-L914F EC can promote repulsion and inhibition of morphogenesis in WT EC (competitive advantage) to propel their own clonal expansion. In addition, the reduced recruitment of WT EC was independent of vessel size as no difference was detected in small versus large vessels.

The contribution of EC proliferation (ie, clonal expansion) to the VM phenotype is still debated. Historically, compared with vascular tumors, EC proliferation in VM has not been considered pathological. For this reason, our initial hypothesis was that recruitment of WT EC would be a mechanism allowing pathological VM lumen expansion. Conversely, our results here show that clonal expansion has an important role in VM pathogenesis and can regulate the progressive nature of VM lesions. This is in line with recent studies highlighting the hyperproliferative nature of VM blood vessels. As VMs are characterized by abnormally enlarged vascular channels and are active lesions that grow and recur, it is reasonable to assume that increased EC proliferation has an important role. Here, we would like to speculate that proliferation may be overlooked in clinical VM biopsies as lesions are only resected when they reach a certain size that may not reflect all stages of VM initiation and progression.

### Developmental venous anomalies: current concepts and implications for management [^b4097e4c]. Neurosurgery (2009). Low credibility.

Developmental venous anomalies (DVAs), formerly known as venous angiomas, have become the most frequently diagnosed intracranial vascular malformation. DVAs are currently considered congenital cerebrovascular anomalies with mature venous walls that lack arterial or capillary elements. They are composed of radially arranged medullary veins, which converge in an enlarged transcortical or subependymal collector vein, and have characteristic appearances (caput medusae) on magnetic resonance imaging and angiography. DVAs were once thought to be rare lesions with substantial potential for intracerebral hemorrhage and considerable morbidity. The prevalence of incidental and asymptomatic DVAs has been more apparent since the advent of magnetic resonance imaging; recent cohort studies have challenged the once-held view of isolated DVAs as the cause of major neurological complications. The previously reported high incidence of intracerebral hemorrhage associated with DVAs is currently attributed to coexistent, angiographically occult cavernous malformations. Some patients may still have noteworthy neurological morbidity or die as a result of acute infarction or hemorrhage directly attributed to DVA thrombosis. DVAs can coexist with cavernous malformations and arteriovenous malformations. Such combination or transitional forms of malformations might suggest common pathways in pathogenesis. Recent data support a key role for DVAs in the pathogenesis of mixed vascular malformations.

### Somatic PIK3CA mutations as a driver of sporadic venous malformations [^684ed062]. Science Translational Medicine (2016). Low credibility.

Venous malformations (VM) are vascular malformations characterized by enlarged and distorted blood vessel channels. VM grow over time and cause substantial morbidity because of disfigurement, bleeding, and pain, representing a clinical challenge in the absence of effective treatments (Nguyenet al, 2014; Uebelhoeret al, 2012). Somatic mutations may act as drivers of these lesions, as suggested by the identification of TEK mutations in a proportion of VM (Limayeet al, 2009). We report that activating PIK3CA mutations gives rise to sporadic VM in mice, which closely resemble the histology of the human disease. Furthermore, we identified mutations in PIK3CA and related genes of the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase)/AKT pathway in about 30% of human VM that lack TEK alterations. PIK3CA mutations promote downstream signaling and proliferation in endothelial cells and impair normal vasculogenesis in embryonic development. We successfully treated VM in mouse models using pharmacological inhibitors of PI3Kα administered either systemically or topically. This study elucidates the etiology of a proportion of VM and proposes a therapeutic approach for this disease.

### Semaphorin 3A and 3F promote lumen expansion in TIE2-mutated venous malformation [^fe6361be]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2025). Medium credibility.

Discussion

To date, little research has focused on the cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive pathological enlargment of blood vessels in TIE2-mutated VM. Here, using a VM xenograft model, we showed that lesional vessels were almost exclusively lined by TIE2-mutant EC, while WT EC were mostly absent. With a 3D cell competition assay and 2-dimensional cell confrontation assay, we have shown that TIE2-mutant EC inhibited the ability of WT EC to sprout and migrate while promoting their cell repulsion. This effect was mediated by the overexpression of Sema3A and Sema3F. Knockdown of these chemorepellent molecules restored communication of TIE2-mutant EC with WT EC and rescued the VM phenotype by suppressing vascular lumen enlargement.

The key question of this study was whether the aberrant venous expansion is caused by the recruitment of WT EC into the growing VM lesion. A similar question has been raised by other investigators while studying the development of cerebral cavernous malformations (CCMs). In CCM, brain lesions are characterized by cavernous lesions with ectatic blood vessels caused by loss-of-function mutations in any 1 of the 3 CCM genes. Both VM and CCM pathogenesis are characterized by massively enlarged venous channels. In addition, in CCM, as in other vascular malformations including VM, causative somatic mutations are commonly found at low (< 10%) allelic frequency in patients' affected tissue. This low mutant allelic frequency has prompted investigations into the cellular contributions to the abnormally enlarged blood vessels. Recently, 2 independent, groundbreaking studies have elegantly shown, with the use of a Confetti reporter, that CCM-mutant cells in transgenic mice form enlarged blood vessels by initial clonal expansion followed by recruitment of WT EC into the growing lesion. The recruitment of WT EC into CCM lesions was further demonstrated by mosaicism of CCM-null (mutant) and WT EC in large lesions from patients with CCM.

### Efficacy and safety of anti-angiogenic therapy with IV bevacizumab… [^f13fdd9e]. ClinicalTrials (2024). Medium credibility.

Efficacy and Safety of Anti-angiogenic Therapy With IV Bevacizumab in Patients With Symptomatic Cerebral Arteriovenous Malformations ClinicalTrials. gov ID. Study Overview Brain arteriovenous malformations are responsible for hemorrhagic strokes, particularly in children and young adults. They can also be responsible for chronic neurological disorders: motor or sensory deficits, disturbances of higher functions, epilepsy or disabling headaches. The management of brain AVMs is complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach in an expert center. Available therapies include endovascular embolization, neurosurgical resection and/or radiosurgery. These procedures carry a risk of neurological complications, and are reserved for small AVMs located at a distance from highly functional cerebral structures. To date, no drug therapy is recommended if interventional treatment is not possible.

Several studies on resected brain AVM tissue have demonstrated that these malformations are the site of significant evolutionary inflammatory and neo-angiogenesis processes. Other studies have specifically shown that VEGF levels are increased in AVMs. More recently, a pre-clinical study showed that anti-angiogenic treatment with Bevacizumab reduced vascular proliferation within AVMs in mice. Finally, a Phase II clinical trial in patients with Rendu-Osler disease showed a clinical benefit of IV Bevacizumab on the symptomatology of these vascular malformations, with a reduction in the risk of hemorrhage and the extent of hepatic arteriovenous shunts. A randomized Phase III trial is currently underway to assess the efficacy of IV Bevacizumab in Rendu-Osler disease.

### The role of matrix metalloproteinase-3 in the doxycycline attenuation of intracranial venous hypertension-induced angiogenesis [^a49b72b2]. Neurosurgery (2018). Low credibility.

Background

The molecular mechanism of brain arteriovenous malformation (BAVM) is largely unknown. Intracranial venous hypertension (VH) may enhance focal angiogenesis and promote BAVM development and progression. A rat VH model effectively simulates the hemodynamic microenvironment of this disease.

Objective

To explore the effect of doxycycline in VH-related angiogenesis, as well as the role of matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3) and other molecular factors.

Methods

A rat VH model was generated by common carotid artery and distal external jugular vein anastomosis. Microvessel density (MVD) in the perisinus area and expression of MMP-3/2/9, VEGF, TIMP-1, TGF-β, and HIF-1α were examined, with and without daily doxycycline treatment for 4 wk. The effects of doxycycline were verified in Vitro using human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMECs). MMP-3 overexpression or knockdown in HBMECs was used to confirm the role of MMP-3 in cell functions.

Results

MVD in the perisinus cortex was greatly increased after VH. Doxycycline decreased MVD, suppressed MMP-3 overexpression, and reduced VEGF, TGF-β, and TIMP-1 levels compared with the controls (P < .05). In Vitro, doxycycline decreased HBMEC migration, tube formation, and the mRNA, protein, and enzymatic activity levels of MMP-3. MMP-3 overexpression in HBMECs promoted migration, while knockdown of MMP-3 significantly attenuated proliferation, migration, and tube formation (P < .05).

Conclusion

Our findings indicate that MMP-3 plays an important role in VH-related angiogenesis and the promotion of vascular remodeling. Suppression of MMP-3 overexpression by doxycycline may provide a potential strategy for inhibiting BAVM development.

### Angiopoietin-TIE2 feedforward circuit promotes PIK3CA-driven venous malformations [^85a16c22]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2025). High credibility.

Individuals with VMs caused by TEK or PIK3CA mutations have shown promising responses to rapamycin (sirolimus), which targets mTOR — a downstream component of the PI3K–AKT pathway. More recently, alpelisib, a specific PI3Kα inhibitor, has been used to treat PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum, often including VMs. While these treatments alleviate symptoms, they are rarely curative and have limited impact on established lesions. Studies in patient-derived ECs and in genetic mouse models have demonstrated the expected increase in cell proliferation upon PI3K–AKT activation. However, this effect seems restricted to early-stage lesions, as established lesions in both humansand miceare non-proliferative. Mouse models of Pik3ca -related overgrowth have further underscored the exquisite sensitivity of ECs to abnormal PI3K signaling, and the necessity of active angiogenesis for lesion development in the retina and the central nervous system. Despite these insights, questions remain regarding the mechanisms that drive disease progression and determine the predominant manifestation in skin and subcutaneous tissues.

Here, we used a genetic mouse model of VMs in combination with single-cell transcriptomics to study mechanisms underlying Pik3ca -driven venous-specific vascular overgrowth. Our findings reveal an autocrine feedforward mechanism whereby aberrant PI3Kα activation amplifies TIE2 activity due to an imbalance in the levels of the TIE2 ligands. This imbalance is partly caused by AKT-mediated inhibition of FOXO1, leading to reduced transcription of the antagonistic ligand ANGPT2, concomitant with the recruitment of SMCs producing the agonistic ligand ANGPT1. Importantly, neutralizing these ligands with a soluble TIE2 protein, or inhibiting TIE2 pharmacologically, reduced Pik3ca -driven VM growth in mice, highlighting a promising therapeutic strategy for VM treatment.

### Genetic and epigenetic mechanisms in the development of arteriovenous malformations in the brain [^50b214ba]. Clinical Epigenetics (2016). Low credibility.

Vascular malformations are developmental congenital abnormalities of the vascular system which may involve any segment of the vascular tree such as capillaries, veins, arteries, or lymphatics. Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are congenital vascular lesions, initially described as "erectile tumors", characterized by atypical aggregation of dilated arteries and veins. They may occur in any part of the body, including the brain, heart, liver, and skin. Severe clinical manifestations occur only in the brain. There is absence of normal vascular structure at the subarteriolar level and dearth of capillary bed resulting in aberrant arteriovenous shunting. The causative factor and pathogenic mechanisms of AVMs are unknown. Importantly, no marker proteins have been identified for AVM. AVM is a high flow vascular malformation and is considered to develop because of variability in the hemodynamic forces of blood flow. Altered local hemodynamics in the blood vessels can affect cellular metabolism and may trigger epigenetic factors of the endothelial cell. The genes that are recognized to be associated with AVM might be modulated by various epigenetic factors. We propose that AVMs result from a series of changes in the DNA methylation and histone modifications in the genes connected to vascular development. Aberrant epigenetic modifications in the genome of endothelial cells may drive the artery or vein to an aberrant phenotype. This review focuses on the molecular pathways of arterial and venous development and discusses the role of hemodynamic forces in the development of AVM and possible link between hemodynamic forces and epigenetic mechanisms in the pathogenesis of AVM.

### Venous malformation-causative TIE2 mutations mediate an AKT-dependent decrease in PDGFB [^6c367176]. Human Molecular Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Mutations in the endothelial cell (EC) tyrosine kinase receptor TIE2 cause inherited and sporadic forms of venous malformation. The recurrent somatic mutation L914F and common germline mutation R849W differ in terms of phosphorylation level, as well as sub-cellular localization and trafficking of the receptor. Previous studies have shed light on certain pathogenic properties of R849W, but the mechanisms of action of L914F are unknown. We used global gene expression profiling to study the effects of L914F on ECs. We found that L914F strongly dysregulates genes involved in vascular development, cell migration and extracellular matrix processing, while R849W has weak effects. We also demonstrate, for the first time, that TIE2-mutant ECs are deficient in the production of PDGFB, both in vitro and ex vivo in patient tissues. This defect is mediated by the chronic, ligand-independent activation of AKT by the mutant receptors. Inadequate secretion of the major mural cell attractant likely plays an important role in the development of abnormal vascular channels, contributing to the characteristic paucity of surrounding vascular smooth muscle cells.

### Somatic gain of KRAS function in the endothelium is sufficient to cause vascular malformations that require MEK but not PI3K signaling [^fca76112]. Circulation Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Discussion

AVMs in the brain vasculature are a significant source of morbidity and mortality in children and young adults. New therapies, particularly pharmacological approaches, are desperately needed as existing surgical interventions pose significant risks to patients. It is now apparent that somatic mutations that lead to constitutive activation of the KRAS-MEK pathway are the most common known genetic cause of sporadic bAVMs and occur in the majority of such lesions. – Yet, the mechanisms whereby this signaling pathway can promote abnormal connections between arteries and veins is poorly understood. Here, we have developed the first animal models of this disease and find that expression of active KRAS (G12V or G12D) in the endothelium is sufficient to drive the formation of bAVMs in mice and zebrafish. Furthermore, we demonstrate in zebrafish that inhibition of MEK can block and even reverse AV shunts. These models will serve as valuable platforms to uncover the molecular mechanisms involved in sporadic bAVM pathogenesis and to develop novel therapies. Critically, the lesions observed in our animal models are analogous to human bAVM pathology, providing strong evidence that activating KRAS mutations are causative of the disease and that MEK inhibition may be a feasible approach for treatment of patients with bAVMs.

While these same KRAS mutations promote proliferation of tumorigenic cells, we demonstrate that expression of activated KRAS in the endothelium does not affect proliferation but instead leads to striking changes in EC phenotype. These phenotypes include ectopic sprouting, increased cell size, disorganization of cell shape, expansion of lumen diameter, and abnormal connections between arteries and veins. While we observed AV shunts, establishment of AV identity did not appear to be altered. Instead, we find increased activation of ETS reporter activity in KRAS-expressing cells and in neighboring ECs in vivo. Given the critical role of ETS factors in regulating angiogenesis, coupled with our previous observation of a VEGF-like transcriptional signature in KRAS expressing cells, and our finding of ectopic sprouting in vivo upon KRAS expression, we suggest that alterations in protrusive and migratory behavior plays a significant, or even causative role in the formation of abnormal connections between arteries and veins. In contrast to other AVM mouse models (eg, Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia),– injury or external angiogenic stimuli are not required for AVM formation in adult vessels as KRAS signaling may provide the angiogenic and remodeling cues. Stochastic aberrant connections between arteries and veins or additional physiological cues that remain to be uncovered may contribute to the focal nature of bAVMs in our mouse model (despite widespread expression of mutant KRAS in all ECs).

### Angiopoietin-TIE2 feedforward circuit promotes PIK3CA-driven venous malformations [^ff4f6772]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2025). High credibility.

Venous malformations (VMs) are vascular anomalies lacking curative treatments, often caused by somatic PIK3CA mutations that hyperactivate the PI3Kα–AKT–mTOR signaling pathway. Here, we identify a venous-specific signaling circuit driving disease progression, where excessive PI3Kα activity amplifies upstream TIE2 receptor signaling through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms. In Pik3ca H1047R -driven VM mouse models, single-cell transcriptomics and lineage tracking revealed clonal expansion of mutant endothelial cells with a post-capillary venous phenotype, characterized by suppression of the AKT-inhibited FOXO1 and its target genes, including the TIE2 antagonist ANGPT2. An imbalance in TIE2 ligands, likely exacerbated by aberrant recruitment of smooth muscle cells producing the agonist ANGPT1, increased TIE2 activity in both mouse and human VMs. While mTOR blockade had limited effects on advanced VMs in mice, inhibiting TIE2 or ANGPT effectively suppressed their growth. These findings uncover a PI3K–FOXO1–ANGPT–TIE2 circuit as a core driver of PIK3CA-related VMs and highlight TIE2 as a promising therapeutic target.

### Signaling pathways in the specification of arteries and veins [^c263dc9e]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2014). Low credibility.

The establishment of arterial and venous identity of endothelial cells is critical for the proper anatomic configuration and function of the vascular tree. Arterial and venous specification of endothelial cells is determined by genetic factors, although surrounding cells and hemodynamic forces may also contribute to vascular remodeling. This review provides an overview of the signaling pathways and related transcription factors implicated in differentiation of endothelial cells. We will discuss, in particular, the role of upstream and downstream effectors of Wnt, Sox, and Notch pathways. The understanding of the molecular mechanisms that orchestrate endothelial differentiation may have therapeutic relevance for diseases such as atherosclerosis, arteriovenous malformations, aneurysms, and others.

### Flow goes forward and cells step backward: endothelial migration [^2f48f58a]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Future perspective and conclusion

Despite three decades of development, the success of pro- and anti-angiogenic therapies has been rather modest. The best results achieved in retinal diseases were from the use of anti-VEGF therapies that resulted in the significant preservation and improvement of vision. Clearly, alternative strategies are needed to overcome the current limitations. To date, most efforts to control the process of angiogenic vascular growth have mainly focused on VEGF-A and its receptors, while other factors regulating this process have been largely ignored. Recently, a growing body of evidence has started indicating the importance of venous endothelial cells in developmental and pathological angiogenesis in a number of pathological settings. Venous endothelial cells are distinct from other endothelial subtypes in that they possess high mitotic activity, are able to migrate against blood flow, and can assume the molecular and functional identity of other endothelial subtypes. Despite much progress in understanding the role of the venous endothelium in various developmental and pathological settings, elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that confer these features on the venous endothelium has only just begun. One important feature of this endothelial subtype is that quiescent venous endothelium, unlike other endothelial subtypes, can be reprogrammed to activate their ability to migrate in response to angiogenic and mechanical stimuli. This implies the presence of specific molecular control mechanisms that regulate the reactivation process and migratory activity in the venous endothelium. A better understanding of these mechanisms and why they are unique to the venous endothelium may enable us to develop better therapeutic strategies for angiogenesis-related diseases.

### Functional characterization of Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome gene AGGF1 identifies a novel angiogenic signaling pathway for specification of vein differentiation and angiogenesis during embryogenesis [^725f6a9f]. Human Molecular Genetics (2013). Low credibility.

Specification of arteries and veins is a key process for establishing functional vasculature during embryogenesis and involves distinctly different signaling mechanisms. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGFA) is required for differentiation of arteries; however, the upstream angiogenic factor for vein specification is unknown. Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a congenital vascular disease associated with capillary and venous malformations (VMs), but not with arterial defects. We have previously reported that upregulation of angiogenic factor AGGF1 is associated with KTS, but the molecular mechanism is not clear. Here, we show that AGGF1 is involved in establishing venous identity in zebrafish embryos. Overexpression of AGGF1 led to increased angiogenesis and increased lumen diameter of veins, whereas knockdown of AGGF1 expression resulted in defective vasculogenesis and angiogenesis. Overexpression of AGGF1 increased expression of venous markers (e.g. flt4), but had little effect on arterial markers (e.g. notch5). Knockdown of AGGF1 expression resulted in a loss of venous identity (loss of expression of flt4, ephb4 and dab2), but had no effect on the expression of arterial development. We further show that AGGF1 activates AKT, and that decreased AGGF1 expression inhibits AKT activation. Overexpression of constitutively active AKT rescues the loss of venous identity caused by AGGF1 downregulation. Our study establishes AGGF1 as an angiogenic factor with an important role in the specification of vein identity and suggests that AGGF1-mediated AKT signaling is responsible for establishing venous cell fate. We propose that increased AGGF1 expression leads to increased vein differentiation by inducing activation of AKT signaling, resulting in VMs s in KTS patients.

### Flow goes forward and cells step backward: endothelial migration [^bde2fe6f]. Experimental & Molecular Medicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Using fate mapping that employed a dual Cre and Dre recombinase system that deletes SMAD4 in the pan endothelium and simultaneously labels venous endothelial cells by tamoxifen administration (SMAD4 fx/fx; Cdh5-CreER T2; Gm5127-DreERT2; Rosa26 RC::RG), Lee et al.traced the origin of endothelial cells in AVM lesions to the venous endothelium. Time-course analysis of AVMs showed that AVM formation is initiated by abnormal sprouting from veins and that the majority of endothelial cells in AVMs originate from venous endothelial cells. The lack of polarization/alignment in SMAD4-deficient endothelial cells against flowand the excessive proliferation of endothelial cells in AVM lesionssuggest that AVMs are consequences of the undirected migration of excessively proliferating venous endothelial cells. Recent single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of endothelial cells in a cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) model also revealed that those in CCM lesions originate from a subset of venous/capillary endothelial cells, indicating that the role of venous endothelial cells in malformation is not limited to AVMs. Jin et al.reported that the mosaic loss of ENG (by low-dose tamoxifen injection in ENG iECKO mice) resulted in initial AVM formation in arterioles. Identification of the origin of ECs in those lesions using EC subtype-specific reporter lines may explain the discrepancy in the ENG-deficient setting.

### Semaphorin 3A and 3F promote lumen expansion in TIE2-mutated venous malformation [^d70b932e]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2025). Medium credibility.

Standard treatments are nontargeted and invasive, often consisting of sclerotherapy alone or in combination with debulking surgery. Because VM is prone to relapse, patients require repeated interventions throughout their lives. There are no Food and Drug Administration–approved medical therapies for VM. Clinical trials and preclinical studieshave reported that the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitor rapamycin can improve symptoms and suppress VM lesion expansion, although it does not induce significant lesion regression. Therefore, there is an urgent need to better understand the pathogenesis of VM to develop more effective and less invasive therapeutic interventions.

Gain-of-function mutations in the TEK gene, encoding for TIE2 (endothelial tyrosine kinase receptor), have been associated with the majority (≈56%) of sporadically occurring and inherited cutaneous and mucosal VM. Somatic hyperactive mutations in PIK3CA (catalytic subunit of class I phosphoinositide 3-kinases) have also been associated with a smaller number of VM cases. TIE2 has a crucial role during vascular development as it regulates both the promotion of angiogenesis and the maintenance of vascular quiescence. Hyperactive mutant TIE2 and PIK3CA signaling have been shown to increase the phosphorylation of downstream proangiogenic pathways, including PI3K/AKT (phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase/protein kinase B), to promote proliferation and survival of endothelial cells (EC).– The most prevalent somatic mutation in patients with VM is the TIE2 p.L914F (leucine 914 to phenylalanine; TIE2-L914F) nonsynonymous variant.

### Expression patterns of HIF-1 α under hypoxia in vascular smooth muscle cells of venous malformations [^a1430ab9]. Annals of Plastic Surgery (2015). Low credibility.

Purpose

The molecular pathophysiology of venous malformations (VMs), which are a type of vascular malformation, is poorly understood. Until now, it is known that VM lesions are related to the process of angiogenesis. Because angiogenesis is induced under hypoxic conditions, hypoxia is thought to be important in VM lesion formation. Therefore, we examined the implications of hypoxia on the biological behavior of VM vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). In doing so, we investigated the expression patterns of hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), which plays a key role in hypoxia-induced angiogenesis, to provide a further understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in VM.

Methods

Vascular smooth muscle cells from 5 normal veins and 5 VM lesions were cultured under moderate hypoxic conditions (3% O2, 5% CO2). The effects of hypoxia on HIF-1α expression were measured by immunocytochemical staining, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction.

Results

Overall, the expression of HIF-1α in cells was high after exposure to hypoxia for 6 or 12 hours, but decreased after 24 hours of hypoxia. HIF-1α expression in VM VSMCs was 2 times higher than that in normal VSMCs. Immunocytochemically, HIF-1α was mainly located in the nucleus and the intensity in VM VSMCs was stronger after 6 and 12 hours of hypoxia when compared to the expression pattern of HIF-1α in VSMCs from normal tissue. This suggested that VM tissue is more susceptible to the effects of hypoxia than normal tissue.

Conclusions

These results indicate that the high expression of HIF-1α in VM VSMCs under hypoxic conditions could be an important factor for stimulating downstream angiogenesis in VM. Furthermore, the results of this investigation could provide the basis for future studies of VM pathophysiology, and ultimately lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches.

### Blockade of VEGF-C signaling inhibits lymphatic malformations driven by oncogenic PIK3CA mutation [^da86fc0f]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Introduction

Vascular malformations are chronic, often congenital pathologies that can manifest in different types of blood and lymphatic vessels. These diseases commonly arise from abnormalities in the endothelial cells (ECs) of the affected vessel type(s) that lead to structural and functional vascular defects causing deformation, pain, morbidity, and organ dysfunction. Genome sequencing efforts have identified causative mutations for different types of malformations and opened up possibilities for therapeutic intervention specifically targeting the aberrant signal transduction pathways.

Somatic activating mutations in the PIK3CA gene, encoding the p110α catalytic subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), were identified as causative of ~20% of venous malformations (VM) –, and the majority of lymphatic malformations (LM). The most common VM/LM mutations affecting the helical domain (E542K, E545K) or the kinase domain (H1047R, H1047L) of p110α are identical to those previously found in cancer and other genetic syndromes characterized by tissue overgrowth. Both types of mutations result in basal activation of the PI3K pathway by enhancing dynamic events in the natural activation of p110α that lead to increased lipid binding.

The PI3K lipid kinases control a variety of cellular functions and developmental and homeostatic processes in response to extracellular signals by regulating the plasma membrane phorphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP 3) levels. Of the four p110 isoforms, the ubiquitously expressed p110α has emerged as the key downstream effector of growth factor receptor signaling in most cell types and in particular in the endothelium. Genetic loss-of-function studies in mice demonstrated an important role of p110α in the development of both blood and lymphatic vessels –. Conversely, conditional expression of the PIK3CA -activating mutation in endothelial cells led to vascular overgrowth and malformations in mice. Identification of PIK3CA mutations as drivers of vascular malformations has opened up a possibility for the therapeutic use of PI3K inhibitors in these diseases. Rapamycin and its analogues (sirolimus, everolimus) that target the PI3K downstream effector mTOR can stop the progression of vascular malformations in mice and human, and improve the patients' quality of life. However, regression of lesions is observed only in a minority of patients, which calls for a need to develop new more effective therapies.

### Angiopoietin-TIE2 feedforward circuit promotes PIK3CA-driven venous malformations [^4bbe5d34]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2025). High credibility.

Discussion

VMs frequently arise from mutations that lead to aberrant activation of the endothelial TIE2 receptor, a critical regulator of normal venous differentiation and growth. VMs can also result from activating mutations in the ubiquitous downstream effector PI3Kα, which is normally activated by TIE2 and various growth factor receptors. In this study, we uncovered a venous-specific signaling circuit involving a PI3K–FOXO1–ANGPT–TIE2 cascade that contributes to the vessel-type selective development of PI3Kα-driven vascular malformations. In mutant venous BECs expressing constitutively active Pik3ca H1047R, reduced ANGPT2 expression results from AKT-mediated inactivation of its transcriptional regulator, FOXO1 (Extended Data Fig. 10). This coincided with ectopic recruitment of SMCs expressing the TIE2 agonist ANGPT1 and increased TIE2 activity. Notably, TIE2 inhibition or ligand neutralization was more efficient than rapamycin in suppressing the growth of advanced VM lesions, suggesting a potential therapeutic approach for treating PIK3CA -related venous overgrowth.

### Altered expression patterns of ephrinB2 and ephB2 in human umbilical vessels and congenital venous malformations [^e633884c]. Pediatric Research (2005). Low credibility.

Vascular malformations cause discomfort and pain in children and are often associated with skeletal hypertrophy. Their molecular basis is poorly understood. Ephrin ligands and Eph receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in embryonic vascular development. In mice, some ephrin/Eph family members show a complementary expression pattern in blood vessels, with ephrinB2 being expressed on arterial and EphB4 on venous endothelium. Targeted deletions of the genes reveal their essential roles for conduit vessel development in mice, suggesting similar functions during human vascular development and deregulation in vascular malformations. Here, we have defined the expression patterns of human ephrinB2, EphB4, and EphB2 in normal vessels of neonates (i.e. umbilici) and adults and compared them with those in congenital venous malformations. In adults, normal vessels of the skin, muscle, and legs express ephrinB2 and EphB2 on arterial endothelial cells (ECs), whereas EphB4 is found in arteries and veins. In the umbilicus, EphB2 is a specific marker of arterial ECs, whereas ephrinB2 is additionally expressed in venous ECs, suggesting an arterial function of the veins. In venous malformations, the expression of EphB4 is not altered, but both ephrinB2 and EphB2 are ectopically expressed in venous ECs. This may reflect a nonphysiologic arterialization of malformed veins. Our study shows that the arterial markers ephrin B2 and EphB2 are expressed in a subset of veins, and it remains to be studied whether this is cause or consequence of an altered vascular identity.

### Shaping waves of bone morphogenetic protein inhibition during vascular growth [^d951f787]. Circulation Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Rationale

The BMPs (bone morphogenetic proteins) are essential morphogens in angiogenesis and vascular development. Disruption of BMP signaling can trigger cardiovascular diseases, such as arteriovenous malformations.

Objective

A computational model predicted that BMP4 and BMP9 and their inhibitors MGP (matrix gamma-carboxyglutamic acid [Gla] protein) and CV2 (crossveinless-2) would form a regulatory system consisting of negative feedback loops with time delays and that BMP9 would trigger oscillatory expression of the 2 inhibitors. The goal was to investigate this regulatory system in endothelial differentiation and vascular growth.

Methods and Results

Oscillations in the expression of MGP and CV2 were detected in endothelial cells in vitro, using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting. These organized temporally downstream BMP-related activities, including expression of stalk-cell markers and cell proliferation, consistent with an integral role of BMP9 in vessel maturation. In vivo, the inhibitors were located in distinct zones in relation to the front of the expanding retinal network, as determined by immunofluorescence. Time-dependent changes of the CV2 location in the retina and the existence of an endothelial population with signs of oscillatory MGP expression in developing vasculature supported the in vitro findings. Loss of MGP or its BMP4-binding capacity disrupted the retinal vasculature, resulting in poorly formed networks, especially in the venous drainage areas, and arteriovenous malformations as determined by increased cell coverage and functional testing.

Conclusions

Our results suggest a previously unknown mechanism of temporal orchestration of BMP4 and BMP9 activities that utilize the tandem actions of the extracellular antagonists MGP and CV2. Disruption of this mechanism may contribute to vascular malformations and disease.

### Somatic gain of KRAS function in the endothelium is sufficient to cause vascular malformations that require MEK but not PI3K signaling [^daf78d72]. Circulation Research (2020). Medium credibility.

KRAS activating mutations have been observed in both codon 12 (G12V, G12D, G12C) and in codon 61 (Q61H). – These same mutations are highly prevalent in cancer, where they constitutively activate KRAS by preventing GTP hydrolysis. Activating mutations have also been identified in BRAF and MAP2K1/MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1) in AVMs. Each of these mutated genes function in the MEK/ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) kinase cascade, suggesting this pathway plays a key role in AVM pathogenesis. Indeed, we observed robust MEK/ERK activity in all bAVM tissues that we examined, even those that did not contain detectable KRAS mutations, indicating that excessive activity of this pathway is a central feature in the pathogenesis of these lesions.

Interestingly, somatic mutations in the endothelium have been observed in several other vascular malformations, including capillary malformations and venous malformations, but the mutations and signaling pathways in these diseases are distinct. – Based on this information, targeted therapies for venous malformations have been tested in slow-flow lesions in patients, with some success. – MEK signaling has been implicated in artery development – and angiogenesis, and we previously showed that inhibition of the MEK pathway could suppress abnormal endothelial cell (EC) gene expression networks and morphology in active KRAS-transfected cells in vitro. These findings suggest that exploration of MEK/ERK pathway inhibition may be warranted in sporadic bAVM patients. This is intriguing given the recent approval of several MEK inhibitors for treating cancer. However, the failure to demonstrate that KRAS activation definitively leads to bAVMs in animal models remains a significant hurdle to testing these, and other novel therapies in a preclinical setting.

### Angiopoietin-TIE2 feedforward circuit promotes PIK3CA-driven venous malformations [^f92af611]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2025). High credibility.

Source data

Previous studies in the mouse retina have reported that Pik3ca -driven VM growth requires active angiogenesis. To determine if cutaneous VMs show a similar dependence, we induced Pik3ca H1047R expression at 10 or 20 weeks of age when the dermal vasculature is no longer proliferating. Unexpectedly, Pik3ca H1047R still promoted vascular lesion formation in this quiescent dermal vasculature (Fig. 1b–d). Two weeks after topical application of 4-OHT to the adult ear skin, vascular lesions were smaller compared to those induced in juvenile mice (Fig. 1b, d). However, by 6 weeks after induction, the overgrowth and phenotypic characteristics were comparable across the three induction protocols (Fig. 1b–d). Although systemic low-frequency recombination was also observed in other vascular beds with this treatment regime, VM lesions consistently appeared only in select organs, such as the female reproductive organs (Extended Data Fig. 1b, c). The susceptibility of BECs in the uterus, fallopian tube and ovaries to Pik3ca H1047R -driven overgrowth (Extended Data Fig. 1b, c) likely reflects the continuous angiogenic state of these tissues.

To investigate the dependence of cutaneous VMs on the key angiogenic regulator vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), Pik3ca H1047R; Vegfr1-CreER T2 mice were treated one week before 4-OHT induction with an adeno-associated virus (AAV) encoding a soluble VEGF-Grab, which neutralizes VEGF-A, VEGF-B and placenta growth factor. An AAV encoding a control trap, incapable of ligand binding, was used as a control (Fig. 1e). The effectiveness of VEGF neutralization was validated by the VEGF-Grab-induced reduction of the thyroid vasculature (Extended Data Fig. 1d), a vascular bed known to be highly sensitive to VEGF blockade. While VEGF neutralization in juvenile mice reduced EMCN + dermal vessel area in control mice, it failed to inhibit lesion formation in Pik3ca H1047R mice (Fig. 1e, f). Neutralizing VEGF one week after the onset of VM lesion formation also did not affect lesion growth (Extended Data Fig. 1e), suggesting that VEGF signaling is not required for VM formation and progression. Taken together, these findings demonstrate susceptibility of the mouse dermal vasculature to form Pik3ca H1047R -driven vascular lesions, a vascular bed often affected in individuals with VM carrying this mutation. This susceptibility persists beyond the developmental period and even in the absence of paracrine VEGF.

### Molecular changes associated with vascular malformations [^265b3777]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2019). Medium credibility.

Vascular anomalies are typically classified into two major categories, vascular tumors and vascular malformations. Most vascular malformations are caused sporadically by somatic mosaic gene mutations, and genetic analyses have advanced our understanding of the biomolecular mechanisms involved in their pathogenesis. Culprit gene mutations typically involve two major signaling pathways; the RAS/MAPK/ERK pathway is typically involved in fast-flow arteriovenous malformations, whereas the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is typically mutated in slow-flow venous and lymphatic malformations. These findings suggest new therapeutic approaches to vascular malformations, focusing on targeting the etiologic mutated pathways. This review summarizes the currently available literature reflecting the updated International Society for Study of Vascular Anomalies classification system with emphasis on potential therapeutic targets that will provide vascular surgeons with an updated perspective on the etiologic basis of vascular malformations, allowing improved multidisciplinary collaboration.

### Endothelial cell rearrangements during vascular patterning require PI3-kinase-mediated inhibition of actomyosin contractility [^20995e89]. Nature Communications (2018). Medium credibility.

Among the different players of the angiogenic process, class I PI3-kinases (PI3K) have emerged as a critical node, for both the physiology of endothelial cells, and the pathogenesis of venous malformations, the most common type of vascular malformations. PI3Ks are lipid kinases that signal downstream of a variety of cell surface receptors and regulate cellular functions including growth, proliferation, migration, and metabolism. Upon activation, these enzymes generate the lipid phosphatidlylinositiol-3,4,5-triphosphate, a second messenger that triggers signalling pathways, such as those mediated by the serine/threonine kinase AKT and its substrates. Of the class I PI3K isoforms, PI3Kα has been shown to be the only isoform required for endothelial-mediated vascular development. Several studies have demonstrated that PI3Kα signalling primary regulates cell motility during angiogenesis in mouse and zebrafish.

Our study uncovers a PI3K downstream pathway, namely NUAK1/MYPT1/MLCP, as a critical node in the regulation of cell rearrangement during vessel growth. We have found that blockade of PI3Kα signalling impairs junctional remodelling, inhibits cell rearrangement and drives endothelial cells to grow in superimposed aberrant layers. We identify that a failure of cells to rearrange results in cell stretching and inability to remodel and stabilize new cell–cell contacts upon anastomosis. Through a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches together with an unbiased and deep quantitative phosphoproteomic screening, we have discovered that PI3Kα mediates cell rearrangement by inhibiting actomyosin contractility through NUAK1/MYPT1/MLCP.

### Vascular malformations [^bbcb353e]. Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery (2008). Low credibility.

Learning Objectives

After studying this article, the participant should be able to: 1. Understand the nomenclature and classification system of vascular malformations. 2. Evaluate these patients diagnostically. 3. Outline the surgical and nonsurgical options for treating these lesions.

Summary

Vascular anomalies can be classified into two unique groups-hemangiomas and vascular malformations-based on their endothelial properties. The present review focuses on vascular malformations rather than hemangiomas. The authors address capillary malformations, lymphatic malformations, venous malformations, and arteriovenous malformations. Diagnostic and therapeutic modalities are discussed with relevant case examples. A MEDLINE search was performed to gather all pertinent references. The physician treating these challenging lesions should ideally use a multidisciplinary team-based approach with multispecialty experience in diagnostic and therapeutic modalities for the management of vascular malformations.

### Angiogenesis inhibitors-NCI… [^5076ac6d]. NCI (2018). Low credibility.

What is angiogenesis. Angiogenesis is the formation of new blood vessels. This process involves the migration, growth, and differentiation of endothelial cells, which line the inside wall of blood vessels. The process of angiogenesis is controlled by chemical signals in the body. Some of these signals, such as vascular endothelial growth factor, bind to receptors on the surface of normal endothelial cells. When VEGF and other endothelial growth factors bind to their receptors on endothelial cells, signals within these cells are initiated that promote the growth and survival of new blood vessels. Normally, the angiogenesis stimulating and inhibiting effects of these chemical signals are balanced so that blood vessels form only when and where they are needed, such as during growth and healing. But, for reasons that are not entirely clear, sometimes these signals can become unbalanced, causing increased blood vessel growth that can lead to abnormal conditions or disease.

For example, angiogenesis is the cause of age-related wet macular degeneration. Why is angiogenesis important in cancer. Angiogenesis plays a critical role in the growth of cancer because solid tumors need a blood supply if they are to grow beyond a few millimeters in size. Tumors can actually cause this blood supply to form by giving off chemical signals that stimulate angiogenesis. Tumors can also stimulate nearby normal cells to produce angiogenesis signaling molecules. The resulting new blood vessels "feed" growing tumors with oxygen and nutrients, allowing the tumor to enlarge and the cancer cells to invade nearby tissue, to move throughout the body, and to form new colonies of cancer cells, called metastases. Because tumors cannot grow beyond a certain size or spread without a blood supply, scientists have developed drugs called angiogenesis inhibitors, which block tumor angiogenesis.

The goal of these drugs, also called antiangiogenic agents, is to prevent or slow the growth of cancer by starving it of its needed blood supply. Angiogenesis inhibitors interfere in several ways with various steps in blood vessel growth. Some are monoclonal antibodies that specifically recognize and bind to VEGF. When VEGF is attached to these drugs, it is unable to activate the VEGF receptor. Other angiogenesis inhibitors bind to VEGF and/or its receptor as well as to other receptors on the surface of endothelial cells or to other proteins in the downstream signaling pathways, blocking their activities. Some angiogenesis inhibitors are immunomodulatory drugs — agents that stimulate or suppress the immune system — that also have antiangiogenic properties.

Phenotypic validation of a VOGM-specific EPHB4 kinase domain missense variant in mice

Mice constitutively deficient in EPHB4 or its ligand, Ephrin B2, expire at E10.5 of gestation because vascular plexuses that arise through vasculogenesis are not remodeled by angiogenesis into hierarchical arterial-capillary-venous networks. However, whether EPHB4 kinase activity is required for normal blood vascular development remains unknown. Based on our human genetic (Fig. 1) and integrative genomic results (Fig. 5), we hypothesized that genetic inactivation of a kinase-dependent, EPHB4-regulated RASA1 signaling mechanism in endothelial cells disrupts VEGF-associated developmental angiogenesis in vivo. To test this hypothesis and gain insight into the mechanism of the identified VOGM-associated EPHB4 kinase domain missense variants, we generated EphB4 mutant mice carrying a knock-in allele orthologous to the EPHB4 p. Phe867Leu variant identified in patient KVOGM18-1 (Table 2 and Methods).

### Single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with sporadic brain arteriovenous malformations: where do we stand? [^d7663717]. Brain (2013). Low credibility.

Brain arteriovenous malformations are characterized by a tangle of abnormal vessels directly shunting blood from the arterial to venous circulation. They are known to occur either sporadically or in the context of well-defined genetic disorders. Haemorrhage represents the most severe clinical manifestation, whereas other common symptoms include headache, seizures and neurological deficits. Although sporadic forms do not recognize a specific genetic cause, in recent years, it has been hypothesized that genes involved in angiogenesis and inflammation or coding for proteins, such as fibronectins, laminins and integrins, may play a role in the pathophysiology of brain arteriovenous malformations. More recently, a new trend of genetic studies has investigated the association between sporadic arteriovenous malformations and single nucleotide polymorphisms, single base variations between genomes within members of a biological species or between paired chromosomes in an individual, which may determine the susceptibility to develop complex diseases and influence their natural history. Several polymorphisms in two different families of genes have been associated with disease susceptibly and increased haemorrhagic risk. These genes are mainly involved in the inflammatory cascade and in the regulation of angiogenesis. However, most of the investigated polymorphisms have been selected on the basis of candidate genes because of their potential functional role in the pathogenesis of brain arteriovenous malformations or in other cerebrovascular diseases. Only one hypothesis-free genome-wide association study in a small number of patients has been performed so far, but it was unable to identify significant associations between brain arteriovenous malformations and specific genetic loci. In this article, we review and analyse the polymorphisms investigated to date in association with sporadic brain arteriovenous malformations in the medical literature. We discuss the biological, pathophysiological and clinical implications of these studies, with particular attention to the prediction of haemorrhagic risk and the possibility of building genetic profiles capable of defining the architectural features of the malformations and predict their evolution and natural history. We also present a joint analysis of the risk estimates found by the studies in literature that have evaluated the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms and brain arteriovenous malformation susceptibility and risk of bleeding. This analysis shows a statistically significant association between the interleukin 6 -174G > C (odds ratio = 1.97; 95% confidence interval: 1.15–3.38) and the tumour necrosis factor α -238G > A (odds ratio = 2.19; 95% confidence interval: 1.25–3.83) gene polymorphisms and risk of intracranial haemorrhage and between the activin-like kinase 1 (also known as ACVRL1) intervening sequence 3 -35A > G (odds ratio = 2.42; 95% confidence interval: 1.54–3.8) gene polymorphism and disease susceptibility.

### Angiogenic and prothrombotic markers in extensive slow-flow vascular malformations: implications for antiangiogenic / antithrombotic strategies [^bbe15807]. The British Journal of Dermatology (2010). Low credibility.

Background

Venous and combined malformations are slow-flow haemodynamically inactive lesions that are present at birth and worsen slowly with advancing age, showing no tendency towards involution. The pathogenesis of vascular anomalies has not been fully elucidated, but their formation and progression are closely related to angiogenesis. Localized intravascular coagulation associated with venous or combined malformations is characterized by low fibrinogen, high D-dimers, and normal platelet count.

Objectives

To assess the relationship of angiogenic factors with prothrombotic and endothelial damage/dysfunction markers in patients with extensive slow-flow vascular malformations.

Methods

A 2-year study (2005–2007) included 31 consecutive patients with extensive slow-flow vascular malformations from one centre.

Results

Serum levels of the endothelial receptor tyrosine kinase TIE-2, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 and angiopoietin (Ang)-2 and plasma levels of D-dimer, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1), tissue-type plasminogen activator and von Willebrand factor (vWf) were significantly increased in patients compared with healthy controls, whereas serum levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C, VEGF-D, MMP-2, Ang-1, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-AB and PDGF-BB were significantly decreased in patients compared with controls. A strong positive correlation was present between Ang-1 and PDGF-AB levels (r = 0.63, P < 0.001), between PDGF-AB and PDGF-BB levels (r = 0.67, P < 0.001), and between fibrinogen and PAI-1 levels (r = 0.41, P = 0.031). A strong negative correlation was present between Ang-1 and vWf levels (r = -0.48, P = 0.006), between D-dimer and fibrinogen levels (r = -0.71, P < 0.001), and between PDGF-AB and vWf levels (r = -0.42, P = 0.017).

Conclusions

These findings suggest that angiogenic, coagulation and endothelial damage/dysfunction markers are possibly linked in pathogenesis of extensive slow-flow vascular malformations, and might have therapeutic implications.

### Why are tumour blood vessels abnormal and why is it important to know? [^8a411586]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Vascular malformations

Other MVs evolve into vascular malformation (VM) by retaining their large size and acquiring a smooth muscle-cell coating. Vascular malformations are readily distinguished from normal arteries and veins by their inappropriately large size (for their location) and by their thinner and often asymmetric muscular coat. Vessels of this description closely resemble the non-malignant VMs that occur, for example, in the skin, brain, etc. Vascular malformations are not permeable to plasma proteins. Moreover, unlike MVs and GMPs, VMs persist indefinitely in a low VEGF-A environment, although it is quite possible that their lining endothelium is maintained by VEGF-A secreted by their smooth muscle-cell coat.

### Symptomatic developmental venous anomaly: state-of-the-art review on genetics, pathophysiology, and imaging approach to diagnosis [^a6471c0f]. AJNR: American Journal of Neuroradiology (2023). Medium credibility.

Developmental venous anomalies (DVAs) are the most common slow-flow venous malformation in the brain. Most DVAs are benign. Uncommonly, DVAs can become symptomatic, leading to a variety of different pathologies. DVAs can vary significantly in size, location, and angioarchitecture, and imaging evaluation of symptomatic developmental venous anomalies requires a systematic approach. In this review, we aimed to provide neuroradiologists with a succinct overview of the genetics and categorization of symptomatic DVAs based on the pathogenesis, which forms the foundation for a tailored neuroimaging approach to assist in diagnosis and management.

### Vascular malformations [^32e8865f]. Pediatric Clinics of North America (2010). Low credibility.

Vascular malformations are rare but important skin disorders in children, which often require multidisciplinary care. The goal of this article is to orient pediatricians to the various types of vascular malformations. We discuss the clinical characteristics, diagnostic criteria, and management of capillary, venous, arteriovenous, and lymphatic malformations. Associated findings and syndromes are also discussed briefly.

### Mutation of key signaling regulators of cerebrovascular development in vein of galen malformations [^286d653f]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

Integration of our WES findings with scRNA-seq datasets of the developing human cerebrovasculature helped define developing endothelial cells as a potential key spatio-temporal locus of VOGM pathophysiology (see Fig. 5). Pathway analysis showed VOGM genes are enriched in growth-factor-regulated, tyrosine receptor kinase-associated signaling, which regulates vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, and arterio-venous specification. Thus, tamoxifen-induced Ephb4 fl/F867L Cdh5-CreERT2 mice expressing a VOGM-patient mutation that disrupts EphB4 kinase activity in fetal endothelial cells exhibited impaired remodeling of primitive vascular plexuses by VEGF-regulated sprouting angiogenesis, a process required for development of hierarchical arterial-capillary-venous networks. VOGM genes are also enriched in pathways that regulate axon pathfinding, which is important for vascular patterning. Elucidating the mechanistic details of how VOGM variants impact vasculogenesis, including the intercellular communication between developing neural and endothelial cell types, will be important topics of future investigation.

Although rare, damaging DNVs of large effect contribute ~12% of VOGM cases, variants in additional genes likely contribute to disease pathogenesis. Our Monte Carlo simulation based on observed damaging DNVs estimated ~66 genes contribute to VOGM by a de novo mechanism. Future WES of 250 or of 1,000 trios should yield respective saturation rates of 20.1% and 70.5%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 11). The consequence of cis-regulatory elements and more complex structural variants remains unknown. The still unclear impact of somatic variants requires additional deep sequencing in matched normal and affected-tissue pairs to enable their characterization. Genomic repeats, transposable elements, and epigenomic changes should also be investigated using more comprehensive long-read sequencing technologies.

Our findings have several clinical implications. The enrichment of damaging variants in the VOGM cohort suggests that variant carrier offspring may be at increased risk for VOGMs as well as for capillary malformations and potentially other AVMs. However, not all variant carriers develop capillary malformations, making the presence of capillary malformations an unreliable clinical marker for transmission risk in affected families. These observations highlight the importance of family history and the potential use of exome sequencing-based screening for risk assessment among family members. Family members of VOGM patients with positive exome sequencing results might benefit from intracranial imaging with MRI/MRA, especially in the setting of suspicious mucocutaneous lesions.

### Angiopoietin-TIE2 feedforward circuit promotes PIK3CA-driven venous malformations [^8207129e]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2025). High credibility.

Rapamycin has additional context-dependent effects that warrant consideration. The well-known immunosuppressive effects of rapamycinmay contribute to its beneficial effects in limiting vascular lesion growth, as has been proposed, at least in the case of lymphatic malformation. While the second mTOR complex, the AKT-activating mTORC2, is not directly inhibited by rapamycin, prolonged treatment has been shown to affect its activity in certain cell types by inhibiting the assembly of the complex. This likely explains the reduced AKT phosphorylation observed in cultured ECs carrying activating TEK or PIK3CA mutations after rapamycin treatment. Conversely, in PI3K-dependent cancers, rapamycin treatment has been shown to trigger a feedback activation of PI3K–AKT, which involves mTORC1 substrates. The context-dependent impact of rapamycin on mTOR-mediated AKT regulation may contribute to the varying success of rapamycin in different clinical contexts. Although AKT is acknowledged as the major downstream effector of PI3K, it should also be noted that PI3K is involved in other cellular processes independently of AKT. The complexity of the PI3K pathway underscores the potential for therapeutic interventions in VMs through inhibitors of its feedback regulators, such as TIE2. The critical role of TIE2 signaling in preserving vascular integrity may explain why its short-term inhibition is effective on advanced lesions, as opposed to rapamycin alone. However, it seems essential to target aberrant TIE2 activity without blocking it completely, to avoid potentially negative effects on vessel integrity. Interestingly, the compassionate use of the TIE2 kinase inhibitor rebastinib was reported to significantly improve both the outcome and quality of life of a patient with severe cervicofacial VMs caused by an activating TEK mutation, which had been refractory to other treatments.

In summary, our findings highlight the importance of TIE2 signaling as a critical access point for treating advanced VMs. Even a short-term treatment regimen may offer an alternative strategy for patients with intractable lesions.

### Mutation of key signaling regulators of cerebrovascular development in vein of galen malformations [^232b6456]. Nature Communications (2023). High credibility.

To elucidate the pathogenesis of vein of Galen malformations (VOGMs), the most common and most severe of congenital brain arteriovenous malformations, we performed an integrated analysis of 310 VOGM proband-family exomes and 336,326 human cerebrovasculature single-cell transcriptomes. We found the Ras suppressor p120 RasGAP (RASA1) harbored a genome-wide significant burden of loss-of-function de novo variants (2042.5-fold, p = 4.79 x 10 −7). Rare, damaging transmitted variants were enriched in Ephrin receptor-B4 (EPHB4) (17.5-fold, p = 1.22 x 10 −5), which cooperates with p120 RasGAP to regulate vascular development. Additional probands had damaging variants in ACVRL1, NOTCH1, ITGB1, and PTPN11. ACVRL1 variants were also identified in a multi-generational VOGM pedigree. Integrative genomic analysis defined developing endothelial cells as a likely spatio-temporal locus of VOGM pathophysiology. Mice expressing a VOGM-specific EPHB4 kinase-domain missense variant (Phe867Leu) exhibited disrupted developmental angiogenesis and impaired hierarchical development of arterial-capillary-venous networks, but only in the presence of a "second-hit" allele. These results illuminate human arterio-venous development and VOGM pathobiology and have implications for patients and their families.

### Why are tumour blood vessels abnormal and why is it important to know? [^17a29db6]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Feeder arteries and draining veins

In addition to inducing angiogenesis, tumours and Ad-VEGF-A 164 also stimulate abnormal arteriogenesis and venogenesis, leading to the formation of the large, often tortuous blood vessels that supply and drain the tumour microvasculature (Figure 2). These vessels have been little investigated. They are generally larger than VMs and acquire structural properties that are intermediate between arteries and veins. Similar to VMs, they persist indefinitely in a low VEGF-A environment.

### Angiopoietin-TIE2 feedforward circuit promotes PIK3CA-driven venous malformations [^86ad6a2d]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2025). High credibility.

Rapamycin, which targets the AKT downstream effector mTORC1, has shown success in the clinical treatment of VMs, although its effectiveness can vary. In particular, treatment duration and timing may impact outcomes. Most clinical studies involve long-term rapamycin treatment to manage established lesions, whereas better overall efficacy is observed when therapy is initiated early. This improved effect is likely due to its antiproliferative action on actively growing lesions, inhibiting cellular anabolism, protein synthesis and growth. The short-term rapamycin treatment scheme used in our study, designed for a rapidly developing mouse model of VM, differs from clinical treatment regimens. Nevertheless, we found that TIE2 inhibition over a 2-week treatment period was more effective in reducing the growth of advanced Pik3ca -driven VMs in mice compared to rapamycin treatment. Our analysis did not reveal a statistically significant additive effect of BAY-826-mediated TIE2 inhibition when combined with rapamycin over a 2-week treatment period. However, in mice treated with soluble TIE2 from lesion initiation, short-term rapamycin administration after lesion establishment led to a significant reduction in vessel area and capillary SMC coverage compared to TIE2 ligand neutralization alone. While this treatment scheme is not therapeutically applicable to humans, it serves as proof of principle for the involvement of TIE2 in Pik3ca -driven VMs.

### Vascular FLRT2 regulates venous-mediated angiogenic expansion and CNS barriergenesis [^9fee8bf7]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

Introduction

Venous endothelial cells (ECs) are the primary cellular source of angiogenesis, the expansion of a preexisting vascular network necessary for the vascularization of all tissues. Angiogenic sprouts from the venous plexus drive the formation of the capillary and arterial network as shown in the development of several tissues, such as the heart, brainand retina. Rapidly proliferating venous ECs migrate in the opposite direction of the bloodstream, undergo differentiation into various endothelial subtypes (capillaries, tip cells and arteries), and act as the main supplier of ECs for the expansion of the vascular network (reviewed in ref.). Notably, quiescent venous endothelium gets reactivated upon injury and acquires a proliferative and migratory behavior, suggesting the presence of venous-specific molecular control mechanisms. Despite significant advancements in comprehending the role of venous endothelium in various developmental and pathological contexts, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for angiogenic expansion from the venous endothelium is still unexplored.

Fibronectin leucine rich transmembrane (FLRT) proteins, a versatile family of molecules comprising three members (FLRT1-3), have been recently shown to have dual roles during the development and function of neuronal and vascular systems. Since their identification, multiple functions of FLRTs in early embryonic and neuronal development have been characterized –. For instance, FLRTs regulate cell repulsion and attraction during neuronal migration in the cerebral cortex and can interact with a myriad of other signaling partners. We have previously identified FLRT signaling complexes as novel angioneurins, by showing that FLRT3 is mostly expressed in the neuronal compartment of the retina and regulates developmental retina vascularization by exerting repulsive responses in ECs expressing Uncoordinated-5 receptor B (Unc5B). Few studies have pointed out the role of FLRT2 in ECs; early expression of FLRT2 in placental vessels contributes to placental labyrinth formation, and tumor-specific inter-endothelial adhesion mediated by FLRT2 controls pathological angiogenesis and cancer aggressiveness. However, FLRT2 is also expressed in vessels of the central nervous system (CNS) under physiological conditions, suggesting a potential role in CNS vascularization that has yet to be explored.

### Defective flow-migration coupling causes arteriovenous malformations in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia [^1a154107]. Circulation (2021). Medium credibility.

Background

Activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1) is an endothelial transmembrane serine threonine kinase receptor for BMP family ligands that plays a critical role in cardiovascular development and pathology. Loss-of-function mutations in the ALK1 gene cause type 2 hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, a devastating disorder that leads to arteriovenous malformations. Here, we show that ALK1 controls endothelial cell polarization against the direction of blood flow and flow-induced endothelial migration from veins through capillaries into arterioles.

Methods

Using Cre lines that recombine in different subsets of arterial, capillary-venous, or endothelial tip cells, we show that capillary-venous Alk1 deletion was sufficient to induce arteriovenous malformation formation in the postnatal retina.

Results

ALK1 deletion impaired capillary-venous endothelial cell polarization against the direction of blood flow in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, ALK1-deficient cells exhibited increased integrin signaling interaction with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2, which enhanced downstream YAP/TAZ nuclear translocation. Pharmacologic inhibition of integrin or YAP/TAZ signaling rescued flow migration coupling and prevented vascular malformations in Alk1 -deficient mice.

Conclusions

Our study reveals ALK1 as an essential driver of flow-induced endothelial cell migration and identifies loss of flow-migration coupling as a driver of arteriovenous malformation formation in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia disease. Integrin-YAP/TAZ signaling blockers are new potential targets to prevent vascular malformations in patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

### Arterial-lymphatic-like endothelial cells appear in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 2 and contribute to vascular leakage and arteriovenous malformations [^3a35d214]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

ECs are critical for maintaining normal vasculature, in which arterial, capillary, and venous ECs line the vessels and coordinate with other vascular cells to build efficient networks for supplying blood, exchanging substrates, and returning blood through the veins. ALK1 is predominantly expressed in arterial ECs and lack of ALK1 impairs the differentiation of arterial ECs. Interestingly, previous studies have also shown that ALK1 is involved in the lymphatic vascularization and revealed that the activation of ALK1 inhibits lymphatic vascular formation. – However, it is unclear if ALK1 serves as a bridge between arterial and lymphatic endothelial lineages. It is also unknown how loss function of ALK1 affects mature arterial ECs.

In this study, we discovered a new population of arterial-lymphatic-like ECs that appear after Alk1 deletion. We also discovered a novel mechanism that potentially triggered arterial ECs to acquire unwanted lymphatic endothelial characteristics. We found that these arterial-lymphatic-like ECs cause vascular malformations and vascular leakage. Finally, we identified a compound that ameliorates AVMs by erasing the unwanted characteristics from the arterial ECs in a mouse model.

### Childhood vascular tumors treatment (PDQ ®)-NCI… [^efddbcaa]. NCI (2016). Low credibility.

Vascular malformations are most commonly caused by variants in the MAP2K/PIK3CA pathway. Most are activating somatic variants but, rarely, germline variants are identified. Approximately one-third to one-half of venous malformations result from somatic or, rarely, germline variants in the. TEK gene. Another one-third of venous malformations, and nearly all lymphatic malformations, are caused by somatic variants in PIK3CA. In most cases, PIK3CA variants are identical to canonical cancer variants. Lesions harboring PIK3CA variants are frequently associated with overgrowth of adjacent tissues, as seen in patients with Klippel-Trénaunay syndrome and CLOVES syndrome. Multiple: More than one lesion but noted in the past as greater than five lesions, because of the increased risk of visceral involvement.

The exact mechanism that causes the initial proliferation of blood vessels followed by involution of the vascular component of hemangioma and replacement of fibrofatty tissue is unknown. Several cell types have been isolated from hemangiomas: progenitor/stem cells, endothelial cells, pericytes, and mast cells. These cells appear to play a role in the development of infantile hemangiomas. HemPericytes surround the vasculature and are abundant in the proliferative phase. These cells express markers of pericytes and smooth muscle cells, such as neural-glial antigen 2, platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta, calponin, alpha smooth muscle actin, and NOTCH3. HemPericytes are proangiogenic, as they express increased vascular endothelial growth factor A, decreased angiopoietin-1, increased proliferation, increased vessel formation.

Provasculogenic factors are expressed during proliferation; these factors include VEGF, fibroblast growth factor, CD34, CD31, CD133, lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan receptor 1, and insulin-like growth factor 2. During involution, infantile hemangiomas show increased apoptosis. [.

### Hypoxia-inducible factor pathway and diseases of the vascular wall [^a52b6ada]. Journal of Vascular Surgery (2013). Low credibility.

Background

Hypoxia may contribute to the pathogenesis of various diseases of the vascular wall. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are nuclear transcriptional factors that regulate the transcription of genes that mediate cellular and tissue homeostatic responses to altered oxygenation. This article reviews the published literature on and discusses the role of the HIF pathway in diseases involving the vascular wall, including atherosclerosis, arterial aneurysms, pulmonary hypertension, vascular graft failure, chronic venous diseases, and vascular malformation.

Methods

PubMed was searched with the terms "hypoxia-inducible factor" or "HIF" and "atherosclerosis", "carotid stenosis", "aneurysm", "pulmonary artery hypertension", "varicose veins", "venous thrombosis", "graft thrombosis", and "vascular malformation".

Results

In atherosclerotic plaque, HIF-1α was localized in macrophages and smooth muscle cells bordering the necrotic core. Increased HIF-1α may contribute to atherosclerosis through alteration of smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, angiogenesis, and lipid metabolism. The expression of HIF-1α is significantly elevated in aortic aneurysms compared with nonaneurysmal arteries. In pulmonary hypertension, HIF-1α contributes to the increase of intracellular K(+) and Ca(2+) leading to vasoconstriction of pulmonary smooth muscle cells. Alteration of the HIF pathway may contribute to vascular graft failure through the formation of intimal hyperplasia. In chronic venous disease, HIF pathway dysregulation contributes to formation of varicose veins and venous thromboembolism. However, whether the activation of the HIF pathway is protective or destructive to the venous wall is unclear. Increased activation of the HIF pathway causes aberrant expression of angiogenic factors contributing to the formation and maintenance of vascular malformations.

Conclusions

Pathologic vascular wall remodelling of many common diseases of the blood vessels has been found to be associated with altered activity of the HIF pathway. Therefore, understanding the role of the HIF pathway in diseases of the vascular wall is important to identify novel therapeutic strategies in the management of these pathologies.

### Angiopoietin-TIE2 feedforward circuit promotes PIK3CA-driven venous malformations [^58dc5607]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2025). High credibility.

Analysis of single-cell transcriptomes and clonal tracing of BECs showed a selective expansion of venous and venous capillary ECs in the Pik3ca mutant mice. While the differences in disease pathology between the two lesion types remain incompletely understood, it is plausible that, like normal veins and venous capillaries, they have different abilities to regulate immune responses and control vascular leakage depending on their vessel of origin. Such differences could have critical implications for disease progression and therapeutic responses. Predicted transcription factor activity, based on Pik3ca -driven gene expression changes within these EC populations, identified the AKT-inhibited transcription factor FOXO1 as a central regulator of the PI3K-driven metabolic program and post-capillary venous traits. Intriguingly, a prominent expression of FOXO1 was shown previously in human skin post-capillary venules. Of particular interest, we showed that the antagonistic TIE2 ligand, ANGPT2, is a bona fide direct FOXO1 target gene, which is transcriptionally induced directly upon FOXO1 activation. ANGPT2 was expressed in dermal veins but absent in Pik3ca -driven VM lesions. Similarly, inhibition of FOXO1 and ANGPT2 transcription has been reported in HUVECs expressing the TIE2 overactivating mutation p. Leu914Phe. Pik3ca -driven VM lesions showed an increased presence of SMCs producing the TIE2 agonist ANGPT1 (ref.and this study), along with an increase in venous EC TIE2 activation that was also detected in biopsy samples of cutaneous PIK3CA -related human VMs. These results suggest a shift in the balance of TIE2-activating ligands, a key regulatory mechanism for venous differentiation and growth, which can also promote the transformation of inflamed capillaries into venules primed for leukocyte trafficking. The post-capillary venous characteristics of the Pik3ca -driven lesions may, in turn, promote leukocyte influx and inflammation, which has increasingly been recognized as an important component of the pathogenesis of different types of vascular malformations. In support of these notions, our previous analyses of a mouse model of advanced Pik3ca -driven cutaneous VMs revealed infiltration of B cells and neutrophils, which can produce ANGPT1 (ref.) and thereby further amplify TIE2 signaling.

### Angiopoietin-TIE2 feedforward circuit promotes PIK3CA-driven venous malformations [^a8264560]. Nature Cardiovascular Research (2025). High credibility.

Source data

To further substantiate these data, we used AAV vectors encoding a soluble TIE2 extracellular domain (AAV9-mTIE2-ECD)to neutralize the ANGPT ligands (Fig. 8e). AAVs were administered one week before 4-OHT induction, and rapamycin treatment started 2 weeks after induction for a 2-week period (Fig. 8e). Ligand neutralization alone significantly reduced vascular area in most mice, with the greatest effect achieved when combined with rapamycin (Fig. 8f, g), while the decrease in vessel diameter was similar between the two treatments (Fig. 8h). Notably, the combined ligand-neutralizing and rapamycin treatment also led to a significant decrease in SMC coverage of mutant capillaries and lesion numbers, while veins remained unaffected (Extended Data Fig. 8g). Control mice treated with AAV-TIE2-ECD showed no apparent vascular alterations (Extended Data Fig. 9e, f).

Next, we performed intravital two-photon imaging of lesions before and after BAY-826/rapamycin treatment to study the dynamics of lesion growth. While most lesions continued to grow in untreated mice, they stopped growing or even decreased in cell number in those administered with the combinatorial treatment (Fig. 8j, k).

Collectively, these findings demonstrate that inhibition of upstream TIE2 signaling effectively suppresses Pik3ca -driven VM growth, in particular when combined with rapamycin, suggesting a promising therapeutic strategy for treating advanced VMs.

### Somatic activating PIK3CA mutations cause venous malformation [^d7458a05]. American Journal of Human Genetics (2015). Low credibility.

Somatic mutations in TEK, the gene encoding endothelial cell tyrosine kinase receptor TIE2, cause more than half of sporadically occurring unifocal venous malformations (VMs). Here, we report that somatic mutations in PIK3CA, the gene encoding the catalytic p110α subunit of PI3K, cause 54% (27 out of 50) of VMs with no detected TEK mutation. The hotspot mutations c.1624G > A, c.1633G > A, and c.3140A > G (p. Glu542Lys, p. Glu545Lys, and p. His1047Arg), frequent in PIK3CA-associated cancers, overgrowth syndromes, and lymphatic malformation (LM), account for > 92% of individuals who carry mutations. Like VM-causative mutations in TEK, the PIK3CA mutations cause chronic activation of AKT, dysregulation of certain important angiogenic factors, and abnormal endothelial cell morphology when expressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The p110α-specific inhibitor BYL719 restores all abnormal phenotypes tested, in PIK3CA- as well as TEK-mutant HUVECs, demonstrating that they operate via the same pathogenic pathways. Nevertheless, significant genotype-phenotype correlations in lesion localization and histology are observed between individuals with mutations in PIK3CA versus TEK, pointing to gene-specific effects.

### Comprehensive phenotypic and genomic characterization of venous malformations [^d1ca5d78]. Human Pathology (2024). Medium credibility.

Venous malformations (VMs) are the most common vascular malformations. TEK and PIK3CA are the causal genes of VMs, and may be involved in the PI3K/AKT pathway. However, the downstream mechanisms underlying the TEK or PIK3CA mutations in VMs are not completely understood. This study aimed to identify a possible association between genetic mutations and clinicopathological features. A retrospective clinical, pathological, and genetic study of 114 patients with VMs was performed. TEK, PIK3CA, and combined TEK/PIK3CA mutations were identified in 49 (43%), 13 (11.4%), and 2 (1.75%) patients, respectively. TEK-mutant VMs more commonly occurred in younger patients than TEK and PIK3CA mutation-negative VMs (other-mutant VMs), and showed more frequent skin involvement and no lymphocytic aggregates. No significant differences were observed in sex, location of occurrence, malformed vessel size, vessel density, or thickness of the vascular smooth muscle among the VM genotypes. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the expression levels of phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) were higher in the TEK-mutant VMs than those in PIK3CA-mutant and other-mutant VMs. The expression levels of p-mTOR and its downstream effectors were higher in all the VM genotypes than those in normal vessels. Spatial transcriptomics revealed that the genes involved in "blood vessel development", "positive regulation of cell migration", and "extracellular matrix organization" were up-regulated in a TEK-mutant VM. Significant genotype-phenotype correlations in clinical and pathological features were observed among the VM genotypes, indicating gene-specific effects. Detailed analysis of gene-specific effects in VMs may offer insights into the underlying molecular pathways and implications for targeted therapies.

### Why are tumour blood vessels abnormal and why is it important to know? [^07629ddc]. British Journal of Cancer (2009). Low credibility.

Conclusions

Tumours induce their vasculature through the unbalanced, local overexpression of a small number of growth factors, particularly VEGF-A. Tumour neovascularization thus differs significantly from the sprouting angiogenesis of normal vascular development, a process that is as yet not well understood, but that results, at least in part, from tightly regulated VEGF-A gradients and the balanced expression of many other growth factors and inhibitors. Tumours generate at least six distinct types of new blood vessels that differ from each other, and from the normal vasculature, with respect to organisation, structure and function. This classification has potential clinical and therapeutic significance. Current anti-VEGF/VEGFR approaches more likely target only a subset of angiogenic tumour blood vessels, that is, MV and GMP, that are dependent on exogenous VEGF-A. By contrast, the mature, smooth muscle-cell-coated daughter blood vessels, as well as the large feeder arteries and draining veins that result from arteriogenesis and venogenesis, are unlikely to be targeted, as they have lost VEGF-A dependence. Feeder arteries and draining veins would seem to be particularly valuable targets, because they supply and drain all of the smaller, angiogenic vessels enclosed within the tumour mass. Finding drugable targets on these blood vessels will require them to be better characterized. However, the genomic and proteomic revolution should make it possible to find such targets, especially because (as success with anti-VEGF/VEGFR drugs has shown) differences between tumour and normal blood vessels need not be absolute for therapy to be effective.

### Recent progress understanding pathophysiology and genesis of brain AVM-a narrative review [^42dff793]. Neurosurgical Review (2021). Medium credibility.

Progress understanding the embryology of AVM, germline, and somatic mutations

There is little doubt that AVM are of dysembryological nature. Based on embryological data of normal brain angiogenesis, Mullan and other colleagues believed that AVM develop from a fistula created when during embryogenesis, the developing transverse veins are crossed at right angles by developing longitudinal arteries. The cortical mantle is normally vascularized from the pial surface by an ingrowth of vasogenic cells that canalize and reach the ependymal surface. Later, a cleft occurs in this venous penetration near the ependyma, resulting in a major drainage toward the surface and a minor drainage into a newly formed subependymal venous plexus. Multiple subarachnoid veins connect the pial network with the dural plexus. A failure occurring in the normally compensated surface vein occlusion process was thought by Mullan to initiate the formation of AVM. He postulated in analogy to the development of dural arteriovenous fistulas that thrombosis and abnormal recanalization might play a role for the development of AVM. In contrast to these assumptions, recent evidence suggests that germline and somatic mutations are crucial for AVM development and that aberrant angiogenesis might be the key mechanism (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1
Cell signal pathways involved in development of AVM. Left side: suspected mechanism involved in HHT related AVMs. Normally, BMP9/TGFβ1 regulates angiogenesis through binding to ALK1/ENG to phosphorylate SMAD and increase PTEN activity, which in turn reduces PI3K signaling. HHT mutation of ALK1 or ENG reduces pSMAD and PTEN, resulting in increased PI3K activity or pERK level, causing increased angiogenesis. For the focal development of AVM, an additional local factor must be postulated. Right side: in sporadic AVM cases, somatic activating mutations in genes KRAS, BRAF, or MAP2K1 increase the level of MEK and pERK, leading to AVM development

### High-throughput transcriptional profiling combined with angiogenesis antibody array analysis in an orbital venous malformation cohort [^8afa3f5d]. Experimental Eye Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Orbital venous malformations (OVMs) are the most common benign orbital vascular disorders in adults and are characterized as enlarging encapsulated vascular neoplasms. These painless lesions grow slowly and become symptomatic with proptosis or visual disturbance. However, the pathogenic mechanism and diagnostic markers of OVMs remain poorly understood. To identify potential pathways involved in OVM formation, a cDNA microarray analysis was conducted with OVM samples and normal vascular tissues. These data were deposited in the National Omics Data Encyclopedia (NODE) database (accession number: OER033009). These pathway expression data were further confirmed by reverse transcription qPCR (RT-qPCR) in an OVM cohort. To explore the diagnostic markers in OVM, an angiogenesis antibody array was analyzed. The altered factors were further validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in the OVM cohort. Transcriptome screening revealed upregulated autophagy and VEGF pathways and downregulated Hippo, Wnt, hedgehog and vascular smooth muscle contraction signaling pathways in OVM samples. Furthermore, plasma EGF (p < 0.001) and Leptin (p < 0.01) levels were significantly elevated in OVM patients. Here, for the first time, we revealed the transcriptional background and plasma diagnostic markers in OVM, providing a novel understanding of OVM pathogenesis and facilitating the early diagnosis of OVM.

### Optimizing treatment selection in venous malformations through imaging-assisted sequential therapy: a case series analysis [^4802d69b]. Journal of Vascular Surgery: Venous and Lymphatic Disorders (2025). Medium credibility.

Article Highlights

- **Type of Research**: Single-center, retrospective cohort study
- **Key Findings**: Ten patients with venous malformations underwent sequential treatment with sclerotherapy (mean 1.7 sessions per patient) followed by surgery. Complete lesion removal was achieved in 50% of cases, with no significant complications (0% infections, tissue necrosis, or secondary hemorrhage). Follow-up (6–18 months) showed improved outcomes in pain, swelling, and cosmetic appearance.
- **Take Home Message**: Sequential treatment combining sclerotherapy and surgery is effective for managing venous malformations with significant interstitial components, offering improved outcomes and safety, particularly in cosmetically sensitive areas.

Venous malformations (VMs), with an incidence of approximately 1 in 10,000, are the most common slow-flow congenital vascular anomalies, accounting for a significant proportion of all vascular malformations.VMs are primarily driven by somatic mutations, notably in the TIE2 gene, which occur during embryogenesis and disrupt critical pathways in vascular endothelial cell differentiation and vessel wall stabilization. Although VMs are not true neoplasms, they exhibit a limited capacity for proliferation, albeit at a significantly slower rate than vascular tumors such as hemangiomas. Usually present at birth, VMs may not be immediately apparent and grow proportionally with the patient, often manifesting during puberty or pregnancy due to hormonal influences. Clinically, VMs often present as soft, compressible masses with a bluish to purple hue, often accompanied by chronic pain. Besides aesthetic concerns, VMs can lead to significant complications, including localized bleeding, thrombosis, and functional impairments, depending on their location, highlighting the importance of timely and effective diagnosis and treatment to develop optimal management strategies.

### Diagnosis and management of infantile hemangioma: executive summary [^63bae064]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Infantile hemangioma (IH) pathogenesis and histopathology note multifactorial contributors and characteristic tissue features, with proposed roles for intrinsic angiogenic and vasculogenic factors and extrinsic factors such as tissue hypoxia and developmental field disturbances; cellular origins may involve endothelial or fetal progenitor cells, a unifying theory posits aberrant proliferation and differentiation of a pluripotent progenitor cell, proliferative IHs show capillary lobules with enlarged draining veins and involuting IHs show fibrofatty stroma with residual "ghost" vessels, and immunohistochemistry is positive for GLUT1, CD31, CD34, factor VIII–related antigen, with GLUT1 most useful for diagnosis.

### Low-flow vascular malformation pitfalls: from clinical examination to practical imaging evaluation – part 2, venous malformation mimickers [^34382893]. AJR: American Journal of Roentgenology (2016). Low credibility.

Objective

The purpose of this article is to review the unusual clinical and radiographic features of venous malformations that can give rise to diagnostic confusion. Entities that can have overlapping clinical and imaging features with venous malformations are also reviewed.

Conclusion

Venous malformations are congenital endothelial malformations secondary to errors in vascular morphogenesis and are usually diagnosed in the first 2 decades of life. The clinical and imaging features of venous malformations often overlap those of other pathologic entities, creating diagnostic confusion. Furthermore, the clinical presentation and imaging appearance of venous malformations can vary, making the diagnosis challenging. Thorough knowledge of the various clinical and imaging features not only of venous malformations but also of the major potential mimic lesions is crucial for clinicians caring for patients with these lesions.

### The pathobiology of vascular malformations: insights from human and model organism genetics [^92ed34bf]. The Journal of Pathology (2017). Low credibility.

Vascular malformations may arise in any of the vascular beds present in the human body. These lesions vary in location, type, and clinical severity of the phenotype. In recent years, the genetic basis of several vascular malformations has been elucidated. This review will consider how the identification of the genetic factors contributing to different vascular malformations, with subsequent functional studies in animal models, has provided a better understanding of these factors that maintain vascular integrity in vascular beds, as well as their role in the pathogenesis of vascular malformations.

### The genetics of vascular birthmarks [^349912b0]. Clinics in Dermatology (2022). Medium credibility.

One in 10 infants are born with a vascular birthmark each year. Some vascular birthmarks, such as infantile hemangiomas, are common, while vascular malformations, such as capillary, lymphatic, venous, and arteriovenous malformations, are less so. Diagnosing uncommon vascular birthmarks can be challenging, given the phenotypic heterogeneity and overlap among these lesions. Both sporadic and germline variants have been detected in various genes associated with vascular birthmarks. Identification of these genetic variants offers insight into both diagnosis and underlying molecular pathways and can be fundamental in the discovery of novel therapeutic approaches. The PIK3/AKT/mTOR and RAS/MEK/ERK signaling pathways, which mediate cell growth and angiogenesis, are activated secondary to genetic variations in vascular malformations. Somatic variants in TEK (TIE2) and PIK3CA cause venous malformations. Variants in PIK3CA also cause lymphatic malformations as well as a number of overgrowth syndromes associated with vascular anomalies. Variants in GNAQ and GNA11 have been identified in both so-called "congenital" hemangiomas and capillary malformations. RASA1 and EPHB4 variants are associated with capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation syndrome. This review discusses the genetics of vascular birthmarks, including the various phenotypes, genetic variants, pathogenesis, associated syndromes, and new diagnostic techniques.

### Vasculogenesis and angiogenesis as mechanisms of vascular network formation, growth and remodeling [^aadf7d1b]. Journal of Neuro-Oncology (2001). Low credibility.

Two distinct mechanisms, vasculogenesis and angiogenesis implement the formation of the vascular network in the embryo. Vasculogenesis gives rise to the heart and the first primitive vascular plexus inside the embryo and in its surrounding membranes, as the yolk sac circulation. Angiogenesis is responsible for the remodeling and expansion of this network. While vasculogenesis refers to in situ differentiation and growth of blood vessels from mesodermal derived hemangioblasts, angiogenesis comprises two different mechanisms: endothelial sprouting and intussusceptive microvascular growth (IMG). The sprouting process is based on endothelial cell migration, proliferation and tube formation. IMG divides existing vessel lumens by formation and insertion of tissue folds and columns of interstitial tissue into the vessel lumen. The latter are termed interstitial or inter-vascular tissue structures (ITSs) and tissue pillars or posts. Intussusception also includes the establishment of new vessels by in situ loop formation in the wall of large veins. The molecular regulation of these distinct mechanisms is discussed in respect to the most important positive regulators, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and its receptors flk-1 (KDR) and flt-1, the Angiopoietin/tie system and the ephrin-B/EpH-B system. The cellular mechanisms and the molecular regulation of angiogenesis in the pathological state are summarized and the differences of physiological and pathological angiogenesis elaborated.

### Analysis of circulating hem-endothelial marker RNA levels in preterm infants [^4be9fc8e]. BMC Pediatrics (2009). Low credibility.

Tie2 is a transmembrane tyrosine kinase protein expressed principally on vascular endothelium which plays a critical role in vascular development. Disruption of Tie2 function in mice resulted in embryonic lethality associated with defects in embryonic vasculature, suggesting a role for Tie2 in blood vessel maturation. Moreover, an activating mutation in the intracellular kinase domain of the human Tie2 gene has been implicated in one form of inherited cutaneo-mucosal venous malformations, further demonstrating the critical function of Tie2 in vascular development. Over expression of Ang1, the Tie2 ligand, in mice can increase vascularization in the skin, whereas delivery of soluble Tie2 can inhibit tumor angiogenesis. Both findings demonstrate that the activation of the angiopoietin/Tie2 signaling pathway can lead to excessive angiogenesis. Interestingly, up-regulation of Tie2 mRNA and protein levels, but not of members of the VEGF/VEGF receptor family, has been observed in most hemangioma-derived endothelial cells. This and other studies are consistent with our finding of the exclusive changes in Tie2 levels but not in the other markers. Thus, we hypothesize that an increased C-RNA level, reflected by elevated Tie2, contribute and/or reflects the formation of excessive and disorganized vasculature associated with brain echogenicity lesion and possibly with other progressive and proliferating vascular lesions found in BPD, ROP and PVL. Further experimental studies at the tissue levels in murine models are required to substantiate this hypothesis.

At present, it is not clear whether the elevated circulating Tie2 transcripts originate from BM-derived endothelial progenitor cells or, alternatively, if they represent immature tissue angioblasts or more mature endothelial cells that are shed from the vessel wall into the circulation during vasculogenesis. There is emerging evidence that cells expressing the combination of CD31, CD45, and Tie-2, and not CD133/Flk1, comprise a discrete population of BM-endothelial progenitor cells. Clearly, as the study only presents RT-PCR data, the cellular origin of the detected circulating Tie2 mRNA needs to be further investigated and there is a possibility that multiple cell types contribute to elevated Tie2 mRNA levels.

### Arterial-lymphatic-like endothelial cells appear in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia 2 and contribute to vascular leakage and arteriovenous malformations [^a40da24e]. Circulation (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

In this study, we took advantage of mouse models of endothelial specific deletion of Alk1 and demonstrated that pulmonary arterial-lymphatic-like ECs appeared after ALK1 deletion. We showed that these arterial-lymphatic-like ECs caused vascular malformations. The results also provided evidence that arterial-lymphatic-like ECs potentially were derived from arterial ECs after loss of ALK1. This information appears to be a previously unknown mechanism of HHT2, which might enhance our understanding of the causative role of dysregulated vascular cell differentiation in the progression of HHT2.

This study suggested that pulmonary arterial ECs that acquired lymphatic endothelial characteristics contributed to the source of pulmonary AVMs. Advanced studies also demonstrated the important role of venous ECs in AVMs of the retinal vascular bed, and showed that venous ECs transitioned into arterial-like cells or migrated toward arterioles to contribute to retinal AVMs. – Differing from the expression in the retinal vascular bed, ALK1 is predominantly expressed in arterial ECs in major organs, including the lungs. Our results from scRNA-seq did not detect arterial or lymphatic endothelial characteristics in pulmonary venous ECs (Figures 2 and 4). We argue that pulmonary venous ECs may not contribute to the alterations in the pulmonary arterial ECs or initiate AVMs. However, the changes in flow dynamics and cell signaling from altered arterial ECs after initiation of AVMs may drive the venous and capillary ECs in a pathogenic direction that coordinates with the altered arterial ECs and form pulmonary AVMs. Further studies using specific arterial or venous lineage tracing would be of interest to study how pulmonary venous ECs might join forces with altered arterial ECs in the formation of AVMs.

### Diagnosis and management of infantile hemangioma [^c60cc00f]. Pediatrics (2015). Medium credibility.

Vascular malformations — These are congenital lesions that may become clinically apparent only later in life because of slow progressive ectasia from intraluminal flow, exhibit a normal rate of endothelial cell turnover throughout their natural history but expand as the patient grows, and do not involute; growth may be influenced by trauma, infection, and hormonal changes. Classification is based on the predominant vessel type: capillary or venulocapillary, venous, lymphatic, arterial, or mixed. Capillary or venulocapillary malformations are also known as "port wine stain" and "nevus flammeus", and venous malformations have often been mistaken for IH.

### Somatic mutations in angiopoietin receptor gene TEK cause solitary and multiple sporadic venous malformations [^a208c8ee]. Nature Genetics (2009). Medium credibility.

Germline substitutions in the endothelial cell tyrosine kinase receptor TIE2 (encoded by TEK) cause a rare, inherited form of venous anomaly known as a mucocutaneous venous malformation (VMCM; refs. 1, 2, 3 and V.W. N.L. M.U. A. Irrthum, L.M.B. et al., unpublished data). We identified a somatic 'second hit' causing loss of function of TIE2 in a resected VMCM and assessed whether such localized, tissue-specific events have a role in the etiology of sporadic venous malformations, which are far more common. We identified eight somatic TEK mutations in lesions from 28 of 57 individuals (49.1%) with sporadic venous malformations; the mutations were absent from the individuals' blood and control tissues. The somatic mutations included one causing a frequent L914F substitution and several double mutations in cis, all of which resulted in ligand-independent TIE2 hyperphosphorylation in vitro. When overexpressed in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, the L914F mutant was abnormally localized and responded to ligand, in contrast to wild-type TIE2 and the common, inherited R849W mutant, suggesting that the mutations have distinct effects. The presence of the same mutations in multifocal sporadic venous malformations in two individuals suggests a common origin for the abnormal endothelial cells at the distant sites. These data show that a sporadic disease may be explained by somatic changes in a gene causing rare, inherited forms and pinpoint TIE2 pathways as potential therapeutic targets for venous malformations.

### Polymorphisms in genes involved in inflammatory and angiogenic pathways and the risk of hemorrhagic presentation of brain arteriovenous malformations [^2e0db812]. Stroke (2004). Low credibility.

Background and Purpose

Accurate estimates of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) risk in patients harboring brain arteriovenous malformation (BAVM) are needed to evaluate interventional strategies and to help guide clinical management. Identification of genetic polymorphisms associated with ICH would facilitate risk stratification in BAVM patients.

Methods

We identified patients with BAVM and documented clinical presentation, demographic data, venous drainage pattern, and BAVM size. Patients were genotyped for 5 polymorphisms in 3 inflammatory cytokine genes, and 9 polymorphisms in 5 angiogenesis-related genes. Association of genotype with risk of hemorrhagic BAVM presentation was evaluated using logistic regression analysis.

Results

We genotyped 180 patients with BAVM (53% female, 57% white, mean age at diagnosis 35 ± 17 years, 41% presenting with ICH). BAVM patients homozygous for the interleukin 6 (IL6)-174G allele had a greater risk of ICH presentation (OR, 2.62, P = 0.003) than IL6-174C carriers. In a multivariate logistic regression model, IL6-174G > C genotype, small BAVM size, and exclusively deep venous drainage were independent predictors of ICH presentation. A similar univariate trend was noted for the TNFalpha-308 GG genotype (P = 0.055). The other polymorphisms genotyped were not associated with ICH.

Conclusions

A polymorphism in the inflammatory cytokine IL6, but not polymorphisms in angiogenesis-related genes, was associated with ICH presentation of BAVM. Further studies are needed to define the role of inflammatory cytokines in the pathogenesis of BAVM hemorrhage.

### Loss of endothelial endoglin promotes high-output heart failure through peripheral arteriovenous shunting driven by VEGF signaling [^d3ee4f7f]. Circulation Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Meet the First Author, see p

ENG (endoglin) protein (also known as CD105 [cluster of differentiation 105]) is a coreceptor for members of the TGF (transforming growth factor)-β superfamily of ligands, with high affinity for BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) 9 and 10. – ENG is expressed in vascular endothelial cells (ECs), mesenchymal stem cells, myofibroblasts, syncytiotrophoblasts, and macrophages. – In ECs, ENG promotes BMP 9/10 signaling through the receptor ACVRL1 (also known as ALK1 [activin receptor-like kinase 1]) to regulate developmental angiogenesis, endothelial migration, and cell shape. Mutations in ENG or ACVRL1 lead to the inherited vascular disorder, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a disease characterized by arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), which are direct connections between arteries and veins. We and others have shown using preclinical models that developmental or pathological angiogenesis is an essential trigger driving the vascular remodeling associated with AVM formation in the developing retina, adult brain, and dermal wound healing. – It is also well established that ENG plays a critical role in angiogenesis, as ubiquitous loss of ENG (Eng −/−) leads to major angiogenesis defects in the developing embryo and early embryonic lethality. Nevertheless, the molecular and cellular mechanisms that drive abnormal vascular remodeling events in quiescent blood vessels to generate AVMs in adult HHT patients remain obscure. Furthermore, there is a growing interest in ENG in cardiovascular disease more broadly, as the extracellular domain of ENG known as soluble ENG is found at increased levels in the circulation (most likely due to shedding from the EC surface) in preeclampsia, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and in patients with increased left heart filling pressures. However, whether soluble ENG is simply a biomarker of disease or has an important biological role in regulating the mature vasculature is unknown. These studies are severely hampered by our lack of understanding of the full-length transmembrane form of ENG in quiescent mature ECs and specifically whether it plays a key role in maintaining the mature cardiovasculature, which is the focus of this investigation.

### Ponatinib combined with rapamycin causes regression of murine venous malformation [^e51dbbed]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2019). Medium credibility.

Objective- Venous malformations (VMs) arise from developmental defects of the vasculature and are characterized by massively enlarged and tortuous venous channels. VMs grow commensurately leading to deformity, obstruction of vital structures, bleeding, and pain. Most VMs are associated with the activating mutation L914F in the endothelial cell (EC) tyrosine kinase receptor TIE2. Therapeutic options for VM are limited and ineffective while therapy with the mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor rapamycin shows moderate efficacy. Here, we investigated novel therapeutic targets promoting VM regression. Approach and Results- We performed an unbiased screen of Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs in human umbilical vein ECs expressing the TIE2-L914F mutation (HUVEC-TIE2-L914F). Three ABL (Abelson) kinase inhibitors prevented cell proliferation of HUVEC-TIE2-L914F. Moreover, c-ABL, common target of these inhibitors, was highly phosphorylated in HUVEC-TIE2-L914F and VM patient-derived ECs with activating TIE2 mutations. Knockdown of c-ABL/ARG in HUVEC-TIE2-L914F reduced cell proliferation and vascularity of murine VM. Combination treatment with the ABL kinase inhibitor ponatinib and rapamycin caused VM regression in a xenograft model based on injection of HUVEC-TIE2-L914F. A reduced dose of this drug combination was effective in this VM murine model with minimal side effects. The drug combination was antiproliferative, enhanced cell apoptosis and vascular channel regression both in vivo and in a 3-dimensional fibrin gel assay. Conclusions- This is the first report of a combination therapy with ponatinib and rapamycin promoting regression of VM. Mechanistically, the drug combination enhanced AKT inhibition compared with single drug treatment and reduced PLCγ (phospholipase C) and ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) activity.

### Endothelial cell clonal expansion in the development of cerebral cavernous malformations [^97c6760b]. Nature Communications (2019). High credibility.

Cerebral cavernous malformation (CCM) is a neurovascular familial or sporadic disease that is characterised by capillary-venous cavernomas, and is due to loss-of-function mutations to any one of three CCM genes. Familial CCM follows a two-hit mechanism similar to that of tumour suppressor genes, while in sporadic cavernomas only a small fraction of endothelial cells shows mutated CCM genes. We reported that in mouse models and in human patients, endothelial cells lining the lesions have different features from the surrounding endothelium, as they express mesenchymal/stem-cell markers. Here we show that cavernomas originate from clonal expansion of few Ccm3-null endothelial cells that express mesenchymal/stem-cell markers. These cells then attract surrounding wild-type endothelial cells, inducing them to express mesenchymal/stem-cell markers and to contribute to cavernoma growth. These characteristics of Ccm3-null cells are reminiscent of the tumour-initiating cells that are responsible for tumour growth. Our data support the concept that CCM has benign tumour characteristics.

TIE2-L914F EC Do Not Recruit WT EC in the Ectatic Lumens In Vivo and Inhibit 3D Morphogenesis of WT EC

EC engineered to express the hyperactive TIE2 p.L914F-mutant receptor are known to exhibit ligand-independent phosphorylation of TIE2 and increased downstream activation of the AKT pathway, a result that we confirmed in our cells. When these EC harboring the hyperactive TIE2 p.L914F mutation are injected into the flanks of immunocompromised nude mice, they generate lesions with ectatic blood vessels, mimicking the pathological lesions of patients with VM. To understand the processes involved in the formation of VM lesions and investigate whether WT EC are recruited into lesional vessels, we used a modified version of this xenograft model. We intermixed fluorescently labeled WT EC (shown in green) and TIE2-L914F EC (shown in magenta) and injected them subcutaneously into mice, within 1 xenograft plug (Figure 1 A). To account for the proliferative advantage of TIE2-L914F EC, cells were injected in a ratio of 5:1 (WT EC: TIE2-L914F EC). Xenograft plugs were analyzed macroscopically on day 14 after cell injection. All the plugs were visually vascularized and perfused (Figure 1 B;). Histologically, the enlarged vascular lumens were lined almost exclusively by TIE2-mutant EC (98.3%), while only a small percentage of WT EC were found in the lesional vessels (1.7%; Figure 1 C and 1 D). These data show that only rare WT EC are incorporated into aberrant veins.

### Ponatinib combined with rapamycin causes regression of murine venous malformation [^4a8bfccc]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2019). Medium credibility.

In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the efficacy and mechanism of combined therapy with ponatinib and rapamycin for the treatment of VM. This targeted combined therapy induced regression of VM in xenograft models with minimal adverse effects. These findings represent a highly promising and novel therapeutical approach to induce regression of difficult-to-treat VM induced by activating TIE2 mutations.

### Ponatinib combined with rapamycin causes regression of murine venous malformation [^468e1502]. Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology (2019). Medium credibility.

According to the International Society for the Study of Vascular Anomalies, VMs are subdivided into sporadic VM, inherited cutaneomucosal VM, blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome, and glomuvenous malformations. Up to 60% of sporadic VM are associated with activating mutations in the EC tyrosine kinase receptor TIE2-encoding gene (TEK). Most TIE2 mutations occur in the intracellular, tyrosine kinase, or kinase insert domain, with the most common substitution being p.L914F. Expression of TIE2 mutations in human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs) causes ligand-independent phosphorylation of TIE2, although to varying degrees. Activation of TIE2 increases the phosphorylation of downstream pathways including PI3K (phosphoinositide-3-kinase)/AKT (protein kinase B) to promote EC proliferation and survival. We previously showed that the TIE2-activating mutation p.L914F is sufficient to induce HUVEC to form VM lesions in nude mice. These murine VMs are bluish lesions that expand over time and have similar histological characteristics to patients' VM. Recent studies reported somatic activating mutations in the catalytic subunit of class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PIK3CA) in association with ≈25% of VM cases. PIK3CA mutations have been reported in several types of cancer, overgrowth syndromes, – and lymphatic malformations. –

### Tie2-R849W mutant in venous malformations chronically activates a functional STAT1 to modulate gene expression [^2b834a35]. The Journal of Investigative Dermatology (2008). Low credibility.

Tie2 is an endothelial receptor tyrosine kinase. An amino-acid substitution of tryptophan for arginine at residue 849 (Tie2-R849W) leads to a ligand-independent activation of its kinase activity. This mutation has been associated with familial venous malformations (VMs), manifested by variable thickness or lack of smooth-muscle cells in the veins of patient lesions. The underlying mechanism for Tie2-R849W action in endothelial cells remains elusive. In this study, we used adenoviral infection to differentiate the effects of ectopic Tie2 (wild type, kinase-dead K855A, or constitutively active R849W) expression on endothelial cellular behaviors and Tie2-mediated downstream targets. Ectopic Tie2 reduced endothelial cell proliferation and serum withdrawal-induced apoptosis, while stimulating migration. When comparing R849W with K855A and its wild-type counterpart, a functional tyrosine kinase activity was required only for migration, and constitutively active Tie2-R849W conferred highest resistance to serum-induced apoptosis, but lowest ability to maintain tube-like structures formed on Matrigel. We further demonstrated that Tie2-R849W chronically induced STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation and the promoter activity of STAT1-responsive IFN-regulatory factor 1 (IRF1). Although STAT1 phosphorylation required JNK and p38MAPK activation, only JNK activation was essential for IRF1 promoter activation by Tie2-R849W. Additional studies are needed to study the role of STAT1 activation in VMs.

### The significance of venous outflow obstruction in dural arteriovenous fistulas [^0689ac1f]. Neurosurgery Practice (2023). Medium credibility.

Cranial dural arteriovenous fistulas (DAVF) are rare cerebrovascular lesions characterized by an abnormal connection between one or more dural arteries and the cerebral venous system. DAVF account for approximately 10% of all intracranial vascular malformations, and the literature describing their natural history is limited. The pathogenesis remains unclear, although their association with vascular injury, such as cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), craniotomy, and head trauma, is well established. -

A hallmark of DAVF is the heterogeneity of their presentation, vascular anatomy, and natural history. Abnormal venous drainage, either from a predisposing factor such as CVST or as a consequence of the dynamic angioarchitecture of the fistula itself, is widely accepted as playing a central role in the formation and progression of DAVF. Subsequent venous hypertension increases the risk of hemorrhage and nonhemorrhagic neurological events (NHNE) such as seizure and nonhemorrhagic focal deficits. Thus, it has been recognized for several decades that cortical venous drainage suggests a more aggressive lesion and is an important part of clinical grading systems proposed by Borden et al and Cognard et al.- The pathophysiology of venous hypertension, local hypoxia, and abnormal angiogenesis that underpins this finding has been documented previously. However, despite this link and the significant association between CVST and subsequent fistula formation, the impact of venous outflow obstruction on the clinical course of cranial DAVF has not been reported.

Furthermore, the rarity of DAVF and difficulties with long-term follow-up has resulted in variable reporting of the risk of hemorrhage and NHNE associated with these lesions. As such, the following study will describe a cohort of cranial DAVF with a particular focus on those patients with concurrent venous outflow obstruction (VOO) and identify factors that may predict the natural history of this uncommon pathology.

Combination treatment with ABL kinase inhibitor ponatinib and mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor rapamycin-induced lesion regression in xenograft models based on human umbilical vein endothelial cell–TIE2-L914F by: Reducing cell proliferation. Increasing cell apoptosis. Mechanistically, by concomitantly enhancing AKT (protein kinase B) inhibition and reducing PLCγ (phospholipase C)-ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) signaling.

Venous malformations (VMs) are slow-flow vascular anomalies with an estimated incidence of ≈1/10 000 of the population. – VMs are compressible bluish lesions that can grow commensurately with the developing child causing disfiguration and morbidity. Pathologically, VM lesions are characterized by ectatic endothelial cell (EC)-lined channels covered by rare and irregularly distributed smooth muscle cells. Expansion of VM can cause extensive disfigurement, organ dysfunction, and other chronic manifestations, including bleeding, oozing, and pain. Elevated D-dimer levels (> 0.5 μg/mL), spontaneous thrombosis, and localized intravascular coagulopathy are reported in ≈50% of VM patients. To reduce the thrombosis events and the pain caused by phleboliths, tailored compression garments, and low molecular weight heparin are often used. Sclerotherapy, alone or in combination with surgery, is the standard first-line therapy. However, these procedures are highly invasive and need to be performed repeatedly because of lesion recurrence.
