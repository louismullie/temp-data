## Question

Can semi glue tide make a patient tired?

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking whether "semi glue tide" can make a patient tired. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about what "semi glue tide" actually refers to and whether it appears in the provided literature. Then, I should verify if any similarly named adhesives or gels have documented systemic effects, especially fatigue. Next, I will consider plausible mechanisms by which a topical adhesive could theoretically cause fatigue. After that, I should review the quality and relevance of any evidence that mentions fatigue in relation to adhesives or gels. Finally, I will synthesize a cautious, clinically grounded conclusion and outline practical next steps if exposure occurred.

> Let me first confirm the terminology, because "semi glue tide" does not map cleanly to a standard medical product in the references. Wait, let me verify whether this could be a misstatement of "semi-solid" formulations or a brand/product name not captured here; I do not see any exact matches for "semi glue tide" in the provided corpus, which makes it hard to attribute specific safety data to that name alone [^notfound].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I should consider near-miss terms that might be confused with this. I see a "semi-solid" oral supplement (Inner Power jelly) studied for cancer-related fatigue, but that is an ingestible product with coenzyme Q10 and L-carnitine, not a topical adhesive, so it is not relevant to a topical "glue" question [^60b978c0]. I also see multiple reports of cyanoacrylate "super glue" causing local tissue injury, including burns and necrosis, but those cases detail local histotoxicity rather than systemic fatigue, so they do not directly answer the question about tiredness [^c6c703af] [^2ce12d6a].

> I need to check whether any adhesive or gel in the set has documented systemic symptoms like fatigue. Let me consider the case series of serious postoperative complications from N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate glue: patients had pain, obstruction, and perforation, but fatigue is not listed among the presenting problems, which argues against a direct systemic fatigue signal from that adhesive in those contexts [^bb4cae54]. I should also confirm whether occupational or environmental exposures to adhesive components have been linked to fatigue; indeed, diisocyanate-containing adhesives have been associated with nonspecific constitutional symptoms including fatigue in building-related illness reports, though attribution is weak and confounded, so I should be cautious about inferring causality from those data [^e3df56bf].

> Next, I should review plausible mechanisms by which a topical adhesive could make someone feel tired. Let me think about this carefully: systemic absorption of volatile monomers or degradation products could theoretically contribute to malaise, and some adhesives release irritants or formaldehyde during polymerization, which can cause local injury and systemic stress responses; however, most high-quality adhesive literature here focuses on mechanical performance and local biocompatibility rather than systemic fatigue endpoints, so direct evidence is sparse [^c6c703af] [^2ce12d6a]. But wait, what if the exposure is high and chronic, or the patient has chemical intolerance or idiopathic environmental intolerance; in those contexts, patients may report fatigue after low-level chemical exposures, though the mechanistic basis remains controversial and evidence quality is limited [^13cb19b8] [^ddafe5b7].

> I should double-check the strength of evidence before concluding. The diisocyanate case series suggests fatigue among workers exposed to multiple airborne chemicals, but there are no asymptomatic controls and no dose–response, so the association is weak and confounded; I cannot reliably attribute fatigue to the adhesive alone from that study [^e3df56bf]. Conversely, the cyanoacrylate case reports document significant local tissue damage without reporting fatigue, which does not prove absence of systemic effects but means there is no direct fatigue signal in those data [^c6c703af] [^2ce12d6a]. Given the absence of controlled studies linking topical adhesives to fatigue, the overall evidence quality for a causal effect is very low [^notfound].

> Let me synthesize a cautious, clinically useful answer. Based on the available references, there is no direct, high-quality evidence that a product named "semi glue tide" causes fatigue, and I cannot confirm its identity from this corpus; therefore, I cannot assert causality. However, it is biologically plausible that certain adhesive components or their degradation products could contribute to nonspecific symptoms, including fatigue, particularly with high exposure, sensitive individuals, or when mixed chemical exposures occur, so a temporal association warrants evaluation but should not be assumed causal without further evidence [^e3df56bf] [^13cb19b8].

> If a patient reports fatigue after suspected exposure, I should confirm the exact product and ingredients, quantify exposure duration and ventilation, and screen for more common causes of fatigue while observing for local irritation or other symptoms. If the product is a cyanoacrylate, I should counsel on local risks and consider that systemic fatigue, while possible, is not well documented in the cases here; if it contains diisocyanates or other sensitizers, I should maintain a low threshold to consider environmental contributors while acknowledging the limited strength of evidence [^c6c703af] [^e3df56bf].

I can't find a product called "semi glue tide". Could you **confirm the exact name** or provide more details (brand, ingredients, how it's used)? If you meant a **cyanoacrylate adhesive** (e.g. Super Glue), fatigue is not a typical effect; local irritation or burns can occur with misuse [^c6c703af] [^2ce12d6a]. If you meant a **medical adhesive** (e.g. fibrin glue, cyanoacrylate sealants), fatigue is not a recognized adverse effect in the literature provided. Please clarify the product so I can give a precise answer.

### Longitudinal screening and management of fatigue, pain, and emotional distress associated with cancer therapy [^d60f914e]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2008). Low credibility.

Goals Of Work

Fatigue, pain, and emotional distress are common symptoms among patients with cancer. We sought to learn about patient perceptions of these symptoms and their treatment.

Materials and Methods

At a baseline assessment and two monthly follow-up assessments, we asked a diverse sample of patients with solid tumor or lymphoma (N = 99) about their fatigue, pain and distress, their treatment for these symptoms, and their satisfaction with treatment via standardized questionnaires and semistructured interviews.

Main Results

In this observational study, patients reported fatigue, pain, emotional distress, and general quality of life at expected levels. Across all assessments, at least half of our sample experienced at least some fatigue, pain, or distress. On the whole, patients and providers do communicate about these concerns, and at least 75% of patients found these discussions helpful when they occurred.

Conclusions

Improved symptom identification and communication may optimize the detection of those at risk of morbidity and decreased quality of life because of excess symptom burden.

### Nanowhisker glues for fatigue-resistant bioadhesion and interfacial functionalization [^347ba814]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Fatigue-resistant functional bioadhesion is desired in diverse applications ranging from wound management to wearable devices. Nanoparticle-based bioadhesives offer versatile functionality but suffer from weak adhesion and fatigue vulnerability due to tissue barriers and poor tissue interactions. Polymer chain-based bioadhesives can form tough bioadhesion but remain vulnerable to fatigue fracture. Here we demonstrate that rationally designed chitosan nanowhiskers glues achieve fatigue-resistant bioadhesion and interfacial functionalization via the combined high aspect ratio, rigidity, polymer-binding and network-forming properties. We deploy these glues using chemical enhancers, microneedle rollers, and ultrasound, enabling strong tissue anchorage despite tissue barriers. At low concentrations, the nanowhisker glue paired with a tough hydrogel achieves an interfacial fatigue threshold of 382Jm -2 and adhesion energy exceeding 1000Jm -2. Transmission electron microscopy reveals a sandwiched nanowhisker layer interpenetrated with both hydrogels and tissues, creating an interface of high stiffness and strength that kinks and arrests interfacial cracks, ensuring unprecedented fatigue resistance. Further, the nanowhisker glue allows for versatile functionalization at the interface such as photothermal and sonodynamic effects. This work expands the performance and functionality of bioadhesives, opening new possibilities for medical and engineering applications.

### Efficacy and safety of an amino acid jelly containing coenzyme Q10 and L-carnitine in controlling fatigue in breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy: a multi-institutional, randomized, exploratory trial (JORTC-CAM01) [^60b978c0]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is one of the most common symptoms reported by cancer patients. This randomized trial investigated the efficacy of the amino acid jelly Inner Power(®) (IP), a semi-solid, orally administrable dietary supplement containing coenzyme Q10 and L-carnitine, in controlling CRF in breast cancer patients in Japan.

Methods

Breast cancer patients with CRF undergoing chemotherapy were randomly assigned to receive IP once daily or regular care for 21 days. The primary endpoint was the change in the worst level of fatigue during the past 24 h (Brief Fatigue Inventory [BFI] item 3 score) from day 1 (baseline) to day 22. Secondary endpoints were change in global fatigue score (GFS; the average of all BFI items), anxiety and depression assessed by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), quality of life assessed by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) and EORTC Breast Cancer-Specific QLQ (EORTC QLQ-BR23), and adverse events.

Results

Fifty-nine patients were enrolled in the study, of whom 57 were included in the efficacy analysis. Median patient age was 50 years. Changes in the worst level of fatigue, GFS, and current feeling of fatigue were significantly different between the intervention and control groups, whereas the change in the average feeling of fatigue was not significantly different between groups. HADS, EORTC QLQ-C30, and EORTC QLQ-BR23 scores were not significantly different between the two groups. No severe adverse events were observed.

Conclusion

IP may control moderate-severe CRF in breast cancer patients.

Trial Registration

The registration number of this study in the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (UMIN-CTR) is UMIN000008646.

Interface characterization with TEM

Four samples were chosen to be fixed and subjected to microtomography for TEM imaging of the interface. All of these used the porcine skin and hydrogel strip dimensions as stated above. The samples are as follows: (1) 200 µL of 1 wt.% suspension of AuNP-ChsNWs simply pipetted onto the skin surface and left for 1 min, (2) 200 µL of 1 wt.% suspension of AuNP-ChsNWs pipetted onto the skin surface and ultrasonicated for 1 min, (3) 200 µL of 1 wt.% suspension of AuNP-ChsNWs simply pipetted onto the skin surface and left for 1 min, then a strip of hydrogel is placed on top; excess suspension was wiped off with Kimwipes, and (4) 200 µL of 1 wt.% suspension of AuNP-ChsNWs pipetted onto the skin surface and ultrasonicated for 1 min, then a strip of hydrogel is placed on top.

The samples were cut with a scalpel into approximately 2.5 × 5 mm strips. The samples were then submersed in 2.5 wt.% glutaraldehyde fixative in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate with 4 wt.% sucrose overnight at 4 °C. After the post-fixative procedure consisted of submersing the sample in 1 wt.% aqueous osmium tetroxide and 1.5 wt.% potassium ferrocyanide for 2 h at 4 °C (Note that OsO 4 is highly poisonous and can lead to blindness. Handle with extreme caution in a well-ventilated fume hood, and follow protocols outlined in the SDS). After post-fix, wash the samples with doubly distilled water for three times and start dehydration by submersing the samples for 10 min in increasing ratios of acetone:water until 100% acetone.

### COPD-related fatigue: impact on daily life and treatment opportunities from the patient's perspective [^c994dbdf]. Respiratory Medicine (2018). Low credibility.

Background

Fatigue is a highly prevalent, challenging and understudied symptom of COPD, which influences the quality of life of patients. This study addresses the patient's perspective on the impact of fatigue on their daily lives and explores possible treatment options to tackle the burden of fatigue.

Methods

Twenty semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten patients hospitalised for a COPD exacerbation and ten outpatients with COPD. Data were transcribed verbatim and coded in an iterative (deductive and inductive) coding process.

Findings

Patients perceived severe negative impact of fatigue on their daily lives and emphasized that they were limited in physical, emotional, cognitive and social functioning. These limitations caused a high mental burden which challenged patients' coping resources and making fatigue a symptom difficult to accept. The majority of patients mentioned that they had, to some degree, lost the joy in life or in some cases, even lost the will to live. Patients reported the need for effective treatment and recommended a multidisciplinary approach and blended care, in which an online treatment to improve fatigue management is combined with face-to-face contact with a healthcare professional to increase social support.

Discussion

These findings indicate that patients perceive the impact of fatigue on their daily lives to be a key factor in decreasing their quality of life. To increase awareness of fatigue in healthcare professionals and patients and to facilitate early fatigue self-management, a pro-active approach by healthcare professionals might be the best way to realize effective tailored treatment.

### Cancer-related fatigue – mechanisms, risk factors, and treatments [^4fa2113f]. Nature Reviews: Clinical Oncology (2014). Medium credibility.

The following constitutes key background information on cancer-associated fatigue:

- **Definition**: Cancer-associated fatigue is a distressing, persistent, subjective sense of physical, emotional, and/or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion associated with cancer and/or cancer treatment, which is non-proportional to recent activity and interferes with usual functioning.
- **Pathophysiology**: Cancer-associated fatigue is multifactorial and involves medical factors (comorbidities, medications, nutritional disorders), psychosocial factors (mood disturbance), behavioral factors (physical deconditioning), and biological factors (anemia, cytokine dysregulation, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation, 5-HT neurotransmitter dysregulation, and alterations in ATP and muscle metabolism).
- **Disease course**: Cancer-associated fatigue and exhaustion is often accompanied by pain, mood changes, sleep disturbances, lack of appetite, decreased activity, and reduced QoL and performance.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: Cancer-associated fatigue is associated with increased all-cause mortality in patients with solid tumors.

### Small-molecule ionic liquid-based adhesive with strong room-temperature adhesion promoted by electrostatic interaction [^6b2b3572]. Nature Communications (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

Adhesives play a prominent role in various industries, including automotive, electronics, medical, construction, labeling, and packaging. Many novel adhesives, including catechol-based materials, have been developed over the past few decades. Generally, polymeric structures with intra-chain covalent bonds and inter-chain entanglement networks are essential for achieving a high adhesion strength. However, polymeric materials usually exhibit high viscosities at high temperatures, which reduces their ability to penetrate target substrates, especially porous substrates. The high viscosities also lead to thick adhesion coatings, which not only causes adhesive waste but also limits their application in flexible devices. Even though organic solvents can be used to dissolve polymeric materials and reduce the layer thickness, this leads to volatile organic compound emissions, unwanted bubbles, and even adhesion failure. The repeated use of polymer adhesives also causes fatigue of molecular components –.

Synthesis of fluorescent ChsNWs

The fluorescent ChsNWs (FITC-ChsNWs) were prepared by labeling ChsNWs with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) via amine-isothiocyanate reaction. Specifically, 1 g of ChsNWs was dispersed in 100 mL of 0.1 M acetic acid. An equal volume of anhydrous methanol was then added gradually under continuous stirring. FITC (17.5 mg, Sigma) was dissolved in anhydrous methanol (1 mg/mL) and added dropwise to the ChsNW solution. The molar feed ratio of FITC to primary amines on the ChsNWs was set at 2%. The reaction proceeded at room temperature in the dark for 2 h. Following the reaction, the mixture was transferred to 14 kDa MWCO dialysis tubing and dialyzed against deionized water for 3 days. The resulting product was recovered by lyophilization.

Synthesis of silica nanoparticles

The silica nanoparticles in this study was synthesized with a nickel-hydrazine templating protocol. Typically, 4.25 g of Brij C10 was added to 7.5 mL of cyclohexane and heated to 50 °C to dissolve the Brij C10. Then, a variable volume of NiCl 2 aqueous solution (0.8 M) was added dropwise to the mixture. For the small, medium, and large silica nanotubes, 0.45 mL, 0.6 mL, and 0.8 mL were added, respectively. After 0.225 mL of hydrazine was added to the mixture, followed by 3 h of stirring at 50 °C. After 0.5 mL of diethylamine and 1 mL of TEOS was added, followed by an additional 3 h stirring. The as-obtained silica nanotubes were then washed with isopropyl alcohol and centrifuged 3 times at 15,300 × g for 10 min. The nanotubes were then dispersed in water after the final centrifugation cycle.

### Therapeutics and COVID-19: living guideline, 10 November 2023 [^cd25534e]. Geneva: World Health Organization (2023). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for long COVID, more specifically with respect to management of fatigue, WHO 2023 guidelines recommend to consider offering a combination of education, skills training on energy conservation techniques (such as pacing approaches), and a cautious return to symptom-titrated physical exercise training (in the absence of post-exertional symptom exacerbation) for the clinical rehabilitation management of fatigue in adult patients with post-COVID-19 condition. Consider providing training in the use of assistive products and environmental modifications in patients experiencing levels of fatigue limiting instrumental activities of daily living. Consider offering psychological support to support coping with the symptom.

### Cyanoacrylate glue burn in a child – lessons to be learned [^c6c703af]. Journal of Plastic, Reconstructive & Aesthetic Surgery (2011). Low credibility.

Cyanoacrylate is the generic name for cyanoacrylate based 'fast-acting' adhesives such as methyl-2-cyanoacrylate and ethyl-2-cyanoacrylate(commonly sold under trade names like Super Glue and Krazy Glue). Other forms have been developed as medical grade glues to be non-toxic and less irritating to skin tissue. Cyanoacrylate has a multitude of uses, ranging from simple domestic applications, to those for industrial purposes. It is an acrylic resin which rapidly polymerises in the presence of water (specifically hydroxide ions), forming long, strong chains, joining the bonded surfaces together. Cyanoacrylate sets quickly, often in less than a minute and a normal bond reaches full strength in two hours and is waterproof. This case report outlines an interesting case of a full thickness burn resulting from skin in contact with cyanoacrylate glue, including highlighting several areas where the management was not appropriate. This was likely due to the novel presentation of this patient, and lack of education of staff. Although there have been cases of burns resulting from this type of glue documented in the literature, there are none of this exact nature and depth. [See figure in text].

### Does diisocyanate exposure result in neurotoxicity? [^e3df56bf]. Clinical Toxicology (2014). Low credibility.

Thrasher et al. 1989

This is a case series report of 15 workers with onset of health effects after their office underwent renovation and remodeling. All employees reported widely variable combinations of symptoms involving mucous membranes, respiratory, musculoskeletal, and the central nervous systems. These symptoms included headaches, memory problems, chronic malaise or fatigue, nausea, dizziness, irritability, and altered olfaction. The report includes an investigation of biologic markers for exposure to formaldehyde, trimellitic anhydride, volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) and TDI through air sampling, a written questionnaire, and blood antibody testing by ELISA. TDI exposure was postulated based on use of TDI-containing adhesives. Indoor air concentration sampling measurements were taken 2 years after exposure began, demonstrating each substance below permissible standards. Antibodies to formaldehyde, TDI and trimellitic anhydride conjugates were also determined. The correlation between symptoms and the geometric mean titers to the conjugates were non-significant. The authors concluded that there might be a synergistic immunological response to airborne chemicals, which included TDI, and recommended immunological monitoring as a potential test for investigating future building-related illness.

Investigation of building-related illnesses is complex, controversial, and most often without specific identification of a causal agent. In this investigation, the authors do not attempt to attribute specific symptoms to the chemicals involved, but rather use antibody testing to correlate symptoms with putative exposure to TDI and the other agents. The absence of asymptomatic controls from the same or another building constitutes a major weakness and limits conclusions on strength of association. Further, the utility of diisocyanate antibody testing as evidence of exposure or disease is very limited due to lack of method standardization and lack of population normative data, and consequently the validity of the method is limited. There is little consistency and no specificity of reported symptoms. Thus, there is insufficient data supporting diisocyanate neurotoxicity.

Scoring and grading

Dysphagia

Dysphagia is scored as follows: 0: able to swallow regular food; 1: able to swallow solid food but with difficulty; 2: able to swallow any semi-solid food; 3: only able to swallow liquids; 4: unable to swallow any substance. Improvement in dysphagia is defined as a decrease of at least 1 point in the dysphagia score.

Cardiac function

According to the "Chinese Chronic Heart Failure Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines", the patient's cardiac functional capacity is assessed. Class I: Patients experience no limitation in any activities, with no symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, or palpitations during ordinary physical activity. Class II: Slight limitation of physical activity is observed; patients feel comfortable at rest, but engaging in ordinary physical activity triggers symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, or palpitations. Class III: Marked limitation of physical activity is evident; patients remain comfortable only at rest or with minimal exertion, rest, but less than ordinary activity causes symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, or palpitations. Class IV: unable to carry on any physical activity without discomfort; symptoms of heart failure at rest; if any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort increases.

Respiratory function

Respiratory function in this study was assessed using the mMRC scale: the scale uses a 0–4 grade assessment method. Grade 0: only shortness of breath with strenuous exercise; Grade 1: shortness of breath when hurrying on the level or walking up a slight hill; Grade 2: walks slower than people of the same age on the level because of breathlessness, or has to stop for breath when walking at own pace on the level; Grade 3: stops for breath after walking about 100 m or after a few minutes on the level; Grade 4: too breathless to leave the house or breathless when dressing or undressing.

Data collection

Preoperative and postoperative (6 months after operation) data were collected from electronic medical records, including baseline characteristics (age, gender, BMI, TNM stage, smoking history, alcohol consumption, comorbidities, tumor location, differentiation degree, and lymph node metastasis), quality of life scores, nutrition status, and functional outcomes. Pearson correlation of two continuous variables was normally distributed using the correlation coefficient (Pearson Correlation Coefficient). Between-1 and 1, where 1 indicates a complete positive correlation, -1 indicates a complete negative correlation, and 0 indicates no linear correlation. All cases were tested as two-sided, and P < 0.05 was identified as statistically significant.

### Fatigue-resistant adhesion of hydrogels [^379ffa83]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Results

Mechanical characterization of fatigue-resistant hydrogel adhesion

We first form the PVA hydrogels with low crystallinity on diverse solid substrates including glass, ceramics, titanium, aluminum, stainless steel, polyurethane (PU), and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) through a freeze–thawing process. Then, we dry and anneal the samples to substantially increase the crystallinity within the hydrogels (see Methods for details). The dry-annealing process also induces the formation of hydrogen bonds between the ordered nanocrystalline domains and the solid surfaces (Fig. 1d). As control samples, we fabricate tough hydrogel adhesion (e.g. polyacrylamide (PAAm)–alginate hydrogel) and common hydrogel adhesion (e.g. PAAm hydrogel and polyacrylic acid (PAA) hydrogel) to solid substrates by covalently anchoring the polymer networks of hydrogels on the substrates (see Methods for details).

### The impact of fatigue on Chinese cancer patients in Hong Kong [^d1ee04a3]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2001). Low credibility.

Fatigue is probably the most common symptom affecting sufferers of cancer and cancer treatments. The aim of this study was to gain an initial understanding of the impact of fatigue on Chinese cancer patients in Hong Kong. Twenty-two chemotherapy patients and 15 radiotherapy patients completed semi-structured interviews by the end of the 2nd week after commencement of their treatment. Chemotherapy patients reported greater severity of fatigue than did radiotherapy patients. Six themes emerged from the study's qualitative data that illustrated the impact of fatigue on patients' lives. These themes were: work and role functioning, daily routines, social life, mental ability, emotional status, and appetite and oral intake. The findings are discussed within the Chinese cultural context, and the need for regular assessment of fatigue in cancer patients is suggested.

### Data-driven de novo design of super-adhesive hydrogels [^d8283eda]. Nature (2025). Excellent credibility.

Underwater adhesion characterization

The tack test was conducted using a SHIMADZU tester (Autograph AG-X) equipped with Trapezium X software. Hydrogel (0.3–0.8 mm thickness) at swelling equilibrium was adhered to the probe using cyanoacrylate adhesive (super glue). For rapid screening, DM-driven hydrogels from the training round and ML-driven hydrogels from three optimization rounds, were prepared as 15 mm diameter samples. For detailed adhesion studies, 10 mm diameter samples were used to avoid exceeding the force range of the instrument. This change in diameter did not affect the adhesive strength results. The hydrogel on the probe was then immersed in a test solution (for example, normal saline) for 5 min to reach equilibrium. The probe descended towards the substrate at 1 mm min −1 until a loading force of 10 N was applied, maintained for 10 s and withdrawn at 10 mm min −1 (Supplementary Fig. 10). These test conditions were used as a standard protocol unless otherwise specified. For repeated adhesion tests, hydrogels rested underwater for 5 min between cycles, with glass substrates replaced every 100 tests. For prolonged attachment–detachment cycles (Extended Data Fig. 8), a 5 N loading force and a 10 s contact time were used to minimize gel fatigue. Each sample was tested at least three times. For hydrogel dataset construction, the highest adhesive strength recorded for each sample was reported as F a, representing maximum adhesion performance under the specific conditions.

### Compressible, anti-fatigue, extreme environment adaptable, and biocompatible supramolecular organohydrogel enabled by lignosulfonate triggered noncovalent network [^47e96aec]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

Low-field NMR spectroscopy was used to investigate the presence state of water within the gel and the interaction between water and polymer (Fig. 4g–i). The relatively rapid free induction decay (FID) of the C-SL-G organohydrogel can be attributed to the SL in the network that acts as crosslinking points, generating a large number of noncovalent crosslinks (the rigid component), which results in a rapidly decaying FID signal. A linear combination of the Weibull function and two exponential functions was applied to fit the FID data, allowing for the determination of apparent spin relaxation time (T 2) values and their relative fractions –. T 2, rigid, T 2, inter, and T 2, mobile represent the relaxation times of the rigid, intermediate, and mobile components, respectively, and the f rigid, f inter, and f mobile represent the corresponding proton fractions, respectively. The f rigid values of all three gels were lower than 5%, indicating a strong interaction between the polymer and the solvent. f mobile is the main form of water in the C-G hydrogel, representing the free water that is not tightly bonded to the polymer. After solvent exchange, the appearance of the three fractions may be caused by the relatively weak binding between EG and water (compared with the interaction between polymer and water). The migration of water with higher degree of freedom to water with lower degree of freedom indicates that the water in the sample becomes more tightly bound to the polymer. The T 2, rigid decreases with the introduction of EG and SL, and the T 2, inter of the C-SL-G organohydrogel is only 1/2 of that of the C-G-EG organohydrogel. This suggests that the EG restricts the solvent molecules within the hydrogel and forms a weak bond with the polymer, while the SL introduction further causes restricted solvent movement and strengthens the interaction between the gel network and the solvent molecules.

### Fatigue-resistant adhesion of hydrogels [^a0aaf37c]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Potential applications of fatigue-resistant hydrogel adhesion

Materials and devices with complex shapes can be exposed to repeated mechanical loads, which pose a challenge to their coating materials in terms of fabrication method and long-term robustness. We demonstrate that the fatigue-resistant hydrogel adhesion can potentially provide a facile and versatile solution towards this challenge. We first present a set of materials and devices, including a glass optical fiber (Fig. 5a before and Fig. 5b after coating), a glass tube (Fig. 5c, d), a stainless steel spring (Fig. 5e, f), a leaf-shaped elastomer (Fig. 5g, h), and a ball-and-socket metallic joint (Fig. 5i-l), which are coated with a hydrogel layer through a dip-coating, freeze–thawing, and dry-annealing process (see Methods for details). The thin (~20 μm in thickness, insets in Fig. 5b, d) and uniform hydrogel coatings are applicable to devices with various feature sizes (from 200 μm in Fig. 5a to 35 mm in Fig. 5i), curvatures (convex surface in Fig. 5a, e, i, concave surface in Fig. 5k, and inner and outer surfaces in Fig. 5c) and diverse materials (glass in Fig. 5a, c, stainless steel in Fig. 5e, i, k, and silicone elastomer in Fig. 5g).

### Pharmacological treatments for fatigue associated with palliative care [^7d36d85d]. The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (2015). Low credibility.

Background

This review updates the original review, 'Pharmacological treatments for fatigue associated with palliative care' and also incorporates the review 'Drug therapy for the management of cancer-related fatigue'. In healthy individuals, fatigue is a protective response to physical or mental stress, often relieved by rest. By contrast, in palliative care patients' fatigue can be severely debilitating and is often not counteracted with rest, thereby impacting daily activity and quality of life. Fatigue frequently occurs in patients with advanced disease (e.g. cancer-related fatigue) and modalities used to treat cancer can often contribute. Further complicating issues are the multidimensionality, subjective nature and lack of a consensus definition of fatigue. The pathophysiology is not fully understood and evidence-based treatment approaches are needed.

Objectives

To evaluate the efficacy of pharmacological treatments for fatigue in palliative care, with a focus on patients at an advanced stage of disease, including patients with cancer and other chronic diseases.

Search Methods

For this update, we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, PsycINFO and EMBASE, and a selection of cancer journals up to 28 April 2014. We searched the references of identified articles and contacted authors to obtain unreported data. To validate the search strategy we selected sentinel references.

Selection Criteria

We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) concerning adult palliative care with a focus on pharmacological treatment of fatigue compared to placebo, application of two drugs, usual care or a non-pharmacological intervention. The primary outcome had to be non-specific fatigue (or related terms such as asthenia). We did not include studies on fatigue related to antineoplastic treatment (e.g. chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgical intervention). We also included secondary outcomes that were assessed in fatigue-related studies (e.g. exhaustion, tiredness).

Data Collection and Analysis

Two review authors (MM and MC) independently assessed trial quality and extracted data. We screened the search results and included studies if they met the selection criteria. If we identified two or more studies that investigated a specific drug with the same dose in a population with the same disease and using the same assessment instrument or scale, we conducted meta-analysis. In addition, we compared the type of drug investigated in specific populations, as well as the frequent adverse effects of fatigue treatment, by creating overview tables.

Main Results

For this update, we screened 1645 publications of which 45 met the inclusion criteria (20 additional studies to the previous reviews). In total, we analysed data from 18 drugs and 4696 participants. There was a very high degree of statistical and clinical heterogeneity in the trials and we discuss the reasons for this in the review. There were some sources of potential bias in the included studies, including a lack of description of the methods of blinding and allocation concealment, and the small size of the study populations. We included studies investigating pemoline and modafinil in participants with multiple sclerosis (MS)-associated fatigue and methylphenidate in patients suffering from advanced cancer and fatigue in meta-analysis. Treatment results pointed to weak and inconclusive evidence for the efficacy of amantadine, pemoline and modafinil in multiple sclerosis and for carnitine and donepezil in cancer-related fatigue. Methylphenidate and pemoline seem to be effective in patients with HIV, but this is based only on one study per intervention, with only a moderate number of participants in each study. Meta-analysis shows an estimated superior effect for methylphenidate in cancer-related fatigue (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.49, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.15 to 0.83). Therapeutic effects could not be described for dexamphetamine, paroxetine or testosterone. There were a variety of results for the secondary outcomes in some studies. Most studies had low participant numbers and were heterogeneous. In general, adverse reactions were mild and had little or no impact.

Authors' Conclusions

Based on limited evidence, we cannot recommend a specific drug for the treatment of fatigue in palliative care patients. Fatigue research in palliative care seems to focus on modafinil and methylphenidate, which may be beneficial for the treatment of fatigue associated with palliative care although further research about their efficacy is needed. Dexamethasone, methylprednisolone, acetylsalicylic acid, armodafinil, amantadine and L-carnitine should be further examined. Consensus is needed regarding fatigue outcome parameters for clinical trials.

Measures

Fatigue severity was determined with the Checklist Individual Strength (CIS), subscale fatigue severity (CIS-fatigue). The CIS consists of 20 items with a fatigue severity subscale of 8 items scored on a 7-point Likert scale (range 8–56). We applied a cut-off score of ≥ 30 for moderate fatigue which was calculated as 0.5SD above the mean CIS-fatigue score from a population-based sample. Information on diagnosis and treatment were collected from medical records. Partners of patients, the latter experiencing CRF as reported by the patient or the partner if it did not concern an included couple, filled out a demographic questionnaire. Screening of HCPs consisted of a questionnaire regarding occupational information and an eligibility check via e-mail.

Participant interviews

Semi-structured interviews and focus groups were conducted either face-to-face or online through a secure video connection. Focus groups consisted of a maximum of 5 individuals, grouped per profession. If attending a focus group was not feasible, HCPs were interviewed individually. We followed a semi-structured guide (see Appendix 1) that was developed by the research team, consisting of experienced researchers in the field of psycho-oncology and dyadic coping, clinical psychologists experienced with CBT for CRF, and a medical oncologist. Patient interviews focused on patients' needs for supportive care, their experiences with care seeking and use, the role of HCPs, and the involvement of partners. Partners were asked about their perceptions of patients' fatigue, care need, seeking, and use. HCPs were asked to share their perspectives on care options for CRF and their experience in discussing CRF with patients and referrals to supportive care interventions. The interviewers (KF and AK) did not have any type of relationship with the participants.

Journal of the American College of Cardiology (2022). High credibility.

PASC-CVS tachycardia and exercise intolerance — exercise therapy guidance is as follows: For those with tachycardia, exercise/orthostatic intolerance, and/or deconditioning, interventions normally used for POTS should be considered. Importantly, such patients are usually unable to tolerate upright exercise (eg, power walking, jogging); moreover, upright exercise can worsen fatigue, resulting in postexertional malaise, and NICE guidelines caution against graded exercise therapy for patients recovering from COVID-19, specifically those diagnosed with ME/CFS. Instead of upright exercise, recumbent or semi-recumbent exercise (eg, rowing, swimming, or cycling) is recommended initially, with transition to upright exercise over time as orthostatic intolerance resolves. Exercise duration should be short initially, and exercise intensity should also be at a submaximal level, sustained for the duration of exercise, with natural increases as tolerance improves. Patients should generally start with daily recumbent exercise for only ~5–10 minutes at a level that allows them to speak in full sentences; thereafter, gradual increases in exercise (eg, 2 additional minutes of exercise per day each week) are recommended.

### Serious postoperative complications induced by medical glue: three case reports [^bb4cae54]. BMC Gastroenterology (2019). Medium credibility.

Background

Various types of medical glues/adhesives/topical coagulants' (referred to as MG hereinafter) have widespread application as surgical adhesives, and have been shown to be safe and effective for a broad range of usage, such as in hemostasis, reinforcement of intestinal anastomoses or sites of potential fluid leakage, adhesion of two surfaces, wound closure, and vascular embolization. However, inappropriate application of MG may sometimes lead to serious complications. Herein, we describe three cases of serious postoperative complications induced by a possible inappropriate use of N-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate MG (NBCA MG).

Case Presentation

Three patients presented with abdominal pain (chronic pain in cases 1 and 2, and acute pain in Case 3), hematochezia (Case 2), and intestinal obstruction (Case 3). All patients had a history of abdominal surgery and intraoperative use of NBCA MG. Abdominal computed tomography and gastroenterological endoscopy revealed foreign bodies (solidified MG in cases 1 and 2) and intestinal obstruction related to a mass of residual non-absorbed MG causing an internal hernia from a dense adhesion (Case 3). All patients underwent exploratory laparotomy, which revealed duodenal perforation, colonic erosion, and an internal hernia, all of which was related to MG use. We undertook removal of the foreign bodies (cases 1 and 2), surgical closure of the site of duodenal erosion (Case 1), partial colectomy (Case 2), and partial enterectomy (Case 3).

Conclusion

Inappropriate application of MG may induce serious complications. We emphasize the importance of careful evaluation of the indications, dosage, and spraying thickness of MG in clinical practice. Serious complications caused by inappropriate application of MG should be reported to raise awareness in the surgical fraternity.

### Compressible, anti-fatigue, extreme environment adaptable, and biocompatible supramolecular organohydrogel enabled by lignosulfonate triggered noncovalent network [^4d6d566c]. Nature Communications (2025). High credibility.

The elastic modulus of C-SL-G organohydrogels increases with the rise in lignin content. The gel stiffness is positively correlated with the lignin content within a certain range, influenced by the benzene ring structure of lignin rigidity. EG enhances the hydrogen bonding between polymer networks. When glycerol, which contains three hydroxyl groups, is chosen for solvent exchange, the resulting hydrogels exhibit higher compressive strength, modulus, and toughness compared to the C-G-EG organohydrogel (Supplementary Fig. 12). This highlights the crucial role of hydrogen bonding within the system. With the introduction of lignin in the gel network, strong interfacial interactions are developed. Lignin acts as shared interconnection points that reinforce the gel network and interweave with each other, effectively dispersing the stress throughout system. Conversely, hydrogels with a higher proportion of SL exhibit decreased compressive strength and toughness due to lignin's self-aggregation, causing uneven stress dispersion throughout the network and limiting the mechanical properties of the organohydrogels. This also explains the trend of increasing and then decreasing tensile properties of organohydrogels (Supplementary Fig. 13). The rheological behavior of the organohydrogels further supports these findings. The G' and loss modulus (G") gradually increase with the introduction of EG and SL, exhibiting their higher stiffness or rigidity. Moreover, the gradual increase in the composite viscosity suggests the gradual enhancement of intermolecular interactions in the organohydrogels. These results underscore the effective enhancement of mechanical properties and stability achieved through the incorporation of EG and SL (Supplementary Figs. 14 and 15).

Figure 3d illustrates the good deformability and resilience of the C-SL-G organohydrogel, which can be easily twisted, knotted, folded and easily withstands a weight of 500 g with minimal deformation (Supplementary Fig. 16). Figure 3e shows pictures of the puncture deformation test, clearly demonstrating that the C-SL-G organohydrogel can endure high levels of localized stress without visible damage or permanent deformation, underscoring its excellent mechanical properties combining both high strength and toughness. Moreover, when four gels of the same size (1.5 cm in length, width, and height) are used as a stand, the upper portion supporting a flat plate can bear the weight of a 70 kg human body, which is equivalent to 3500 times the weight of a single gel itself (Fig. 3f).

### A reversible thermoresponsive sealant for temporary closure of ocular trauma [^8f26a470]. Science Translational Medicine (2017). Low credibility.

Open globe injuries are full-thickness injuries sustained to the eye wall (cornea or sclera), which cause immediate drops in intraocular pressure that may lead to retinal detachment and permanent vision loss if not treated rapidly after injury. The current standard of care for open globe injuries consists of suturing the margins closed, but the technique can be time-consuming, requires specialized training and equipment, and can lead to patient discomfort, abrasion, and infection from eye rubbing. We engineered an injectable, thermoresponsive sealant (TRS) and a custom tool to occlude open globe injuries. The smart hydrogel sealant consists of physically cross-linked N -isopropylacrylamide copolymerized with butylacrylate. At low temperatures, it can be injected as a liquid, and when raised to body temperature, a heat-induced gelation converts the hydrogel into a solidified occlusion. The sealant can be repositioned or removed without causing additional trauma via exposure to cold water. In vitro and ex vivo assessments of mechanical adhesion to eye tissue revealed maintenance of intraocular pressure that is five times greater than the physiological range with reversible seal strength comparable to cyanoacrylate (super glue). In vivo assessment in a rabbit model of ocular trauma demonstrated ease of use for TRS deployment, statistically significant improvement in wound sealing, and no evidence of neurotoxicity, retinal tissue degradation, or significant chronic inflammatory response after 30 days of exposure. Given the advantages of body heat-induced gelation, rapid reversible occlusion, and in vivo safety and efficacy, shape-adaptable TRSs have translational potential as smart wound sealants for temporary occlusion of surgical incisions or traumatic injuries.

This study is the first to describe fatigue, anxiety, depression and sleep quality among patients undergoing haemodialysis during the period of the COVID-19 outbreak. It will be helpful for dialysis staff and healthcare professionals as they identify risk predictors and the burdens of fatigue, anxiety, depression and sleep quality, and develop strategies to improve these symptoms among patient undergoing haemodialysis. Furthermore, it gives a solid foundation for further research, which should identify appropriate interventions to reduce fatigue, anxiety, depression and sleep quality of patients undergoing haemodialysis.

Managing exposures — clinic staff and patient contact guidance indicates that rigorous adherence to recommended practices (using PPE, washing hands frequently, disinfecting equipment and contact surfaces) should confer protection, and the clinic staff should be informed of exposure and closely monitored for the occurrence of symptoms. If any member of the clinic staff develops symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, he or she should be isolated at once and testing sought, and if COVID-19 is confirmed or cannot be definitively ruled out, the individual should be isolated for at least two weeks after all symptoms have resolved. If a staff member knows someone with COVID-19, the staff member should be encouraged (if possible) to socially isolate from the infected person and observe strict social distancing from others in the workplace, while being closely monitored every day for symptoms. Early symptoms of COVID-19 may be mild, such as fatigue, dry cough, or slightly elevated temperature, and if symptoms develop, a healthcare provider should be contacted for possible testing.

### Certified registered nurse anesthetists' occupational exposure to inhalational anesthetic agents: a survey of anesthetic gas safety [^f4cf06f4]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

A positive, and statistically significant relationship (p = 0.049 and p = 0.002) existed between the frequency of smelling anesthetic gas and the frequency of the self-reported symptoms of fatigue and headache respectfully (Table 2). In multiple studies highlighted in the literature review, fatigue was one of the most common self-reported symptoms in association to anesthetic gas exposure.

Table 2
Correlations between frequency of smelling gas and frequency of self-reported symptoms

Our findings support this information as 14.3% of 462 respondents answered they experienced more fatigue when exposed to anesthetic gas. Prior research distinctly differentiates fatigue and lethargy, where fatigue is a lack of physical energy and lethargy is loss of motivational force; therefore, the two were separated from each other in our deployed survey.

A landmark study by Vaisman et al. revealed provider fatigue in the operating room can lead to underperformance by exposed personnel and potential patient harm. Therefore, this suggests the participant's self-report of fatigue may have serious clinical implications. Future research may still be needed to confirm that self-reported fatigue is a problem. Perhaps, fatigue could be confirmed objectively by measuring the concentration of gas in the room. A validated, objective test could then be used to measure provider fatigue. Futhermore, more strictly defined safety limits, improved gas scavenging methods, or refined surveillance is needed to ensure that this potentially detrimental, self-reported symptom is not experienced by CRNA's. These findings suggest that it may be necessary to reduce anesthetic gas exposure in its entirety.

Of the survey respondents, 28 people reported experiencing more headaches when exposed to anesthetic gas. A research study, exploring how healthy the operating room environment is; including anesthetic gas levels, safety protocols, and gas turn over systems, examined patients to determine the most common same-day symptoms of anesthetic gas exposure, headache was found to be in the top five. Our findings are supported by multiple studies in the literature, including a survey of OR personnel who were exposed to anesthetic gases for more than 20 h per week. Almost 40% of subjects reported headaches attributed to anesthetic gas exposure (p < 0.01). These results may be inconsistent with our findings because it is possible that our subjects had less than 20 h per week of exposure. The older age of our surveyed participates may have also skewed headache results.

### Environmental sensitivity [^13cb19b8]. Immunology and Allergy Clinics of North America (2003). Low credibility.

The concept of environmental sensitivity is popular among a small group of physicians who believe that exposure to low levels of numerous environmental chemicals can cause a disease with numerous symptoms but no objective physical or laboratory abnormalities. The condition lacks a clear definition. Numerous theories that have been offered to explain the condition encompass immunotoxic, allergic, autoimmune, neurotoxic, cytotoxic, metabolic, behavioral, psychiatric, iatrogenic, and sociologic mechanisms. Environmental sensitivity has many features in common with other controversial syndromes, such as the chronic fatigue syndrome. Patients with environmental sensitivity frequently are subjected to unproven and unnecessary diagnostic tests and therapeutic modalities. In spite of the lack of physical illness and absence of pathology, patients often experience extreme disability, because their symptoms are triggered by common environmental exposures. The phenomenon of environmental sensitivity needs to be evaluated critically using scientifically sound methods. The practice of clinical ecology encompasses the practices of environmental sensitivity and its theories. Most methods of diagnosis and treatment have been disproved, and the concepts underlying these theories are not scientific. Alternative means of diagnosis and management are presented.

### Evidence-based guidelines for fatigue risk management in emergency medical services [^517f8ce5]. Prehospital Emergency Care (2018). Medium credibility.

Emergency Medical Services (EMS) fatigue — burden, definition, and guidance gap — is characterized as affecting many personnel, being widespread across operations, and lacking formal guidelines. Mental and physical fatigue in the EMS workplace have been linked to EMS personnel injury, patient care error, and adverse events, and the problem is widespread and not isolated to one type of EMS operation or category of EMS clinician. Administrators are not sufficiently equipped to address fatigue in part because of the absence of guidelines for fatigue risk management. Fatigue risk management is defined as "a scientifically based, data-driven addition or alternative to prescriptive work hour limitations, which manages employee fatigue in a flexible manner appropriate to the level of risk exposure and nature of the operation". Despite these efforts, the problem of fatigue in EMS has not been addressed with formal risk management based on a systematic review of the best available evidence.

### Fatigue and its risk factors in cancer patients who seek emergency care [^c1708ba8]. Journal of Pain and Symptom Management (2008). Low credibility.

Cancer patients visiting the emergency center (EC) are seldom assessed or treated for severe fatigue, a common symptom in sick patients due to acute medical conditions arising from cancer and cancer treatment. We provide a profile of cancer-related fatigue within the EC setting. Using a single-item screening tool derived from the Brief Fatigue Inventory, 928 patients (636 with solid tumors, 292 with hematological malignancies) triaged in the EC of a tertiary cancer center rated their fatigue at its worst in the last 24 hours. Patient demographic and clinical factors were retrospectively reviewed from medical records. The chief complaints of patients seeking emergency care included fever, pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, dyspnea, fatigue, and bleeding. More than half (54%) reported severe fatigue (seven or higher on a 0–10 scale) upon EC admission. Moderate to severe pain was highly associated with fatigue severity. Patients with severe fatigue were more likely to be unstable and unable to go home after EC care. In multivariate logistic regression analysis for severe fatigue, the significant risk factors for patients with solid tumors included dizziness (odds ratio [OR] = 3.59), severe pain (OR = 1.98), poor performance status (OR = 1.81), and being female (OR = 1.56). Dyspnea was significantly associated with severe fatigue in patients with hematological malignancies (OR = 4.74). Although fatigue was not the major reason for an ER visit, single-item fatigue-severity screening demonstrated highly prevalent severe fatigue in sicker EC cancer patients and in those patients who also suffered from other symptoms.

The following constitutes key background information on food allergy:

- **Definition**: Food allergy is an adverse food-stimulated immune response initiated on exposure to a given food.
- **Pathophysiology**: Food allergy is mostly caused by IgE-mediated antibodies (type 1 or early; 48%) and IgE-independent immune response including type IV (18%), type III (10%), and type II (6%) to specific foods (milk, eggs, wheat, fish, soy, peanuts, fish, shellfish, cherries, peaches, plums, apricots, nuts, and seeds) influenced by genetic and environmental (improved hygiene, lifestyle, diet and nutrition) factors.
- **Epidemiology**: The prevalence of IgE-mediated food allergy in the US is estimated at 10,000 in 100,000 adults.
- **Disease course**: Clinical manifestations of an immediate reaction include anaphylactic shock, urticaria, and angioedema. Late reaction food reaction symptoms include fatigue, irritability, depression, hyperactivity, insomnia, headache, poor concentration, paleness, itching limbs, involuntary bedwetting, asthma, colds, indigestion, colic, diarrhea, bloating, and skin lesions. The disease impairs QoL necessitating lifelong prevention of the specific food.
- **Prognosis and risk of recurrence**: The mortality risk associated with fatal anaphylaxis is < 1%.

### Fatigue-resistant adhesion of hydrogels [^a6ce7d8e]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Fatigue-resistant hydrogel coatings

The devices, including glass optical fiber, glass tube, stainless steel spring, Ecoflex elastomer, and ball-and-socket metallic joints, were cleaned with ethanol and deionized water, dried with nitrogen flow, and treated by oxygen plasma for 5 min. Immediately after the plasma treatment, the devices were dipped in the 10 wt% PVA solution and hung in a sealed container at room temperature and relative humidity of 90% for 1 h to drain excess PVA solution. The subsequent freeze–thawing, dry-annealing, and swelling were conducted following the above-mentioned procedure.

To visualize the PVA hydrogel coating on diverse substrates and shapes, 0.01 wt% of fluorescein sodium salt for fluorescent labeling was added into the PVA solution prior to dip-coating. The obtained PVA hydrogel-coated substrates were rinsed with deionized water to remove excess dye solution from the surface before imaging. Macroscopic images were taken by a digital camera (D7000, Nikon) under blue light excitation at 480 nm. The hydrogel coating was also imaged using an upright confocal laser-scanning microscope (CLSM; Leica TCS SP8), where the laser intensity, filter sensitivity, and grayscale threshold were adjusted in each application to optimize the contrast of images. A z-stack acquisition program (~20 µm in slice thickness, 50 steps) was used for 3D scanning, and 3D reconstruction images were created using the LAS X 3D visualization software.

### Usefulness of the PERFORM questionnaire to measure fatigue in cancer patients with anemia: a prospective, observational study [^83880371]. Supportive Care in Cancer (2013). Low credibility.

Introduction

Fatigue is one of the cancer symptoms with greatest impact in the patients' daily lives, and it is gaining importance as outcome measure. In a recent survey, it was found that 80% of patients experienced fatigue at least 50% of the time during treatment, and fatigue was ranked as the symptom most impacting daily life, independently of gender or tumor type. The underlying pathophysiology of cancer-related fatigue is very complex and not completely understood. Although some common mechanisms seem to participate, it is probable that the etiology is not the same in all cancer subpopulations (i.e. patients undergoing active chemotherapy, patients with advanced age, survivors or those with palliative care). It is very important to correctly identify both the biological and psychosocial determinants of fatigue, in order to individualise the therapeutic management.

The etiology of cancer-related fatigue is multifactorial and is related to a variety of factors including chemotherapy with alkylating agents, antimetabolites or platinum compounds, radiotherapy or bone marrow transplantation, changes in blood volume, excess lactate production, hypoglycemia, hypotension, generalized stress responses with or without endocrine dysfunction, sleep disturbances, anxiety, or depression. Anemia is one of the factors identified as a causative element in the fatigue experience. Several studies have demonstrated an association between the hemoglobin (Hb) level or its change over time and fatigue intensity assessed by means of Linear Analogue Self-Assessment (LASA) and visual analogue scale (VAS). Furthermore, an association between low hemoglobin and impaired quality of life has also been observed.

Anemia is a common complication in cancer patients. According to the European Cancer Anaemia Survey (ECAS), it is present in 72% of non-solid and 62% of solid tumor patients. The underlying causes of low Hb levels include chemotherapy with platinum salts, which affect erythropoietin (EPO) production secondarily to nephrotoxicity, direct bone marrow damage, caused by almost all cytotoxic drugs, or also the underlying malignancy itself, which directly decreases erythropoiesis due to an attenuated endogenous EPO response. Chronic anemia of cancer is also characterized by generalized hypoxia, which results in severe fatigue.

### MGluR5 mediates post-radiotherapy fatigue development in cancer patients [^dfec2af4]. Translational Psychiatry (2018). Low credibility.

Introduction

Persistent fatigue is a debilitating condition that affects up to 80% of cancer patients. It is not uncommon for fatigue to persist long after cancer treatment, and to negatively impact the quality of life in these patients. Although the underlying mechanisms of persistent fatigue remain elusive, emerging evidence suggests that unresolved inflammation after cancer treatment plays a role in the chronicity of cancer fatigue –.

Radiotherapy is a highly effective standard of care treatment for many types of cancer. However, post-treatment complications such as fibrosis and inflammation often occur as a result of repeated stress. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by ionizing radiation can lead to point mutations in mitochondrial and genomic DNA, mitochondrial dysfunction, genomic instability, oxidative stress, release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and a prolonged inflammatory state –. Subsequently, unresolved inflammation triggered by repeated stress has been shown to result in "sickness behavior", a cluster of symptoms including fatigue, depression, and increased sensitivity to pain.

The association between inflammation and fatigue after repeated stress from daily exposure of ionizing radiation warrants further investigation to determine causality. It is possible that transcriptional activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), which is a ubiquitous transcription factor that regulates expression of various genes including those involved in inflammation, may provide the missing link. In fact, NF-κB activation has been found in cancer and after exposure to ionizing radiation. It is the most studied transcription factor because of its central role in regulating the expression of various pro-inflammatory cytokines.

Our aim was to explore novel gene signatures that can identify cancer patients who are at risk for developing post-radiotherapy fatigue. We have previously shown that worsening of fatigue 1–2 years post-radiotherapy was related to chronic inflammation. In this study, we investigated genetic vulnerabilities that lead to fatigue development, as well as underlying mechanisms of chronic inflammation in fatigued patients. We hypothesized that aberrant activation of NF-κB and pathological T cell activation would help explain the development of fatigue following repeated exposure to radiotherapy in at-risk individuals.

### Certified registered nurse anesthetists' occupational exposure to inhalational anesthetic agents: a survey of anesthetic gas safety [^3bc1a7a3]. BMC Anesthesiology (2022). Medium credibility.

Conclusion

Exposure to inhalation gases by anesthesia providers has been well documented as potentially detrimental. Once reportedly exposed, there are several self-reported symptoms that have the potential to negatively impact the health and wellness of the CRNA, and most importantly, affect patient outcomes. It was discovered that of the 5 self-reported symptoms of fatigue, lethargy, headache, slowed cognitive ability, and mucosal irritation, exposure to anesthetic gas was significantly associated with headache and fatigue. These symptoms, experienced by the CRNA, could negatively impact patient outcomes. This may necessitate the need for more robust methods and procedures used to reduce anesthetic gas exposure reported by the certified nurse anesthetist population.

### A fabrication strategy for millimeter-scale, self-sensing soft-rigid hybrid robots [^4f550974]. Nature Communications (2024). High credibility.

In this work, we present a manufacturing paradigm for millimeter-scale soft-rigid hybrid (SHY) robots (Fig. 1 a) that enables monolithic integration of actuator, mechanical controller, and sensor components, with minimal manual assembly required and a compact form factor (Fig. 1 b). We employ heat-sensitive acrylic adhesive films to bond the robots' constituent materials. The use of this adhesive film has been explored in previous studies for bonding various rigid and flexible materials, such as metals, plastics, and composites. However, this method was not applicable to soft materials or the construction of thermoplastic-film-based soft actuators because the bonding temperature of acrylic adhesive films (i.e. > 182 ∘ C) exceeds the melting point (i.e. 120 ∘ C) of thermoplastic films. Here, we introduce the use of polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) films, which have a high melting temperature (i.e. 327 ∘ C) to create soft-foldable inflatable actuators (Fig. 1 c). We perform permanent chemical surface modification of the PTFE films with hydrogen gas (H 2) plasma to promote adhesion and permanent bonding through lamination via heat and pressure. The final desired motion of the resulting robots is mechanically encoded by rigid-flexible mechanisms, resulting in consistent and controlled motion output. An ionic fluid drives the motion of the proposed robots and also serves as a sensing medium. By embedding an electrical circuit onboard (electrodes) (Fig. 1 d) within its constituent materials, the robot can self-sense the change in its encoded motion by measuring the change in resistance across its body. We demonstrated this approach by creating three distinct SHY robotic modules, each capable of self-sensing its unique degrees of freedom, namely translational, bending, and roto-translational movements (Fig. 1 e). We showcased the scalability of our fabrication method by manufacturing the SHY robotic modules in different scales (i.e. 5 and 11.5 mm in outer diameter). We performed extensive mechanical characterizations of each robotic module, including range of motion, force and torque, power density, and fatigue testing. To showcase the potential use of the proposed robotic technology, we built a self-sensing soft-rigid hybrid continuum robot (Fig. 1 f). With this robot, we demonstrated real-time shape-sensing using embedded ionic resistive sensors. Finally, we integrated various end effectors, including a robotic grasper (manufactured using the same approach), a needle, and an optical fiber onto the SHY continuum robot and performed robotic pick-and-place of soft and hard objects with various shapes and sizes, needle steering and tissue puncturing, and optical fiber steering tasks.

### A qualitative analysis of internet forum discussions on hard flaccid syndrome [^bac80dc5]. International Journal of Impotence Research (2020). Medium credibility.

Hard flaccid (HF) syndrome is a complex symptom that significantly impacts a man's sexual and social life. Since there is currently only one case series available in the literature regarding HF syndrome, it has not been recognized as a real medical condition. HF syndrome has mostly been reported in several patient forums and its exact definition, prevalence, etiology, and treatment are unknown. We hereby, aimed to understand the nature of HF syndrome and how it is perceived among men. Online forum sites in the English language were systematically evaluated to perform a descriptive qualitative assessment. "Hard flaccid; forum" term was searched in Google ® and data were collected from forum posts. Datasets were analyzed using thematic analysis within a three-month period (September 2018-November 2018) and were combined to triangulate analysis. A total of 12 forum discussions, containing 6150 comments, were analyzed. Themes that arose included: "I would like to ensure that I have HF"; "How did I end up like this?"; "Seeking support for treatment choices - who will help me?"; "How can I cope with this condition?". Thematic analysis revealed that most HF cases began after a traumatic event. The reported incidence of HF-related symptoms varies considerably. The most commonly associated symptoms of HF are penile semi-hardness in the flaccid state, penile sensory changes, erectile dysfunction, and emotional distress. Although it is not recognized by major medical authorities, many men appear to suffer from symptoms related to HF syndrome. Future basic science and clinical studies must be conducted to understand the exact pathophysiology of HF syndrome and to develop effective therapies.

### Immune-checkpoint targeting drug conjugates: a novel class of promising therapeutic agents for cancer treatment [^c6c7b993]. NPJ Precision Oncology (2025). Medium credibility.

CD70

The immune checkpoint molecule CD70 and its receptor CD27, both members of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily, are aberrantly expressed in a variety of hematological and solid malignancies. Dysregulation of the CD70-CD27 signaling axis within tumors and their microenvironment is associated with tumor progression and immunosuppression. Aberrant CD70 expression was reported in several solid tumors, including RCC, NPC, glioblastoma, melanoma, lung carcinoma, cervical carcinoma, breast carcinoma, ovarian carcinoma, and mesothelioma, while virtually absent in prostate cancer and CRC. Few IDCs targeting CD70 were evaluated in the past years, but abandoned due to low response rates and toxicity concerns, while one (PRO-1160) has recently entered clinical investigation.

AMG-172 consists of a human IgG1 mAb conjugated to lysine residues via a non-cleavable linker (4-[N-maleimidomethyl] cyclohexane-1-carboxylate) and DM1, a semi-synthetic derivative of maytansine. AMG-172 was assessed in a phase I, first-in-human study (NCT01497821) in patients with relapsed/refractory clear cell renal cell carcinoma irrespective of CD70 expression (Table 1). In the dose-exploration phase (0.15–2.4 mg/kg administered every two weeks), the MTD was identified as 1.6 mg/kg, with thrombocytopenia being the most common dose-limiting toxicity. All the 37 patients experienced at least one TEAE, with the most frequently reported being thrombocytopenia, nausea, decreased appetite, vomiting, fatigue and anemia. The ORR was only 5.4%.

Preparation of lignosulfonates

KL was sulfonated to prepare lignosulfonates with different degrees of sulfonation. Briefly, 0.4 mL of 37% formaldehyde, 5.0 g of Na 2 SO 3 and 10 g of KL were mixed with 30 mL of deionized water in a 100 mL stainless steel reactor. The reactor was heated to 140 °C in an oil bath and kept for 3 h to obtain SL 1. The content of sulfonate group in SL 1 was 2.9 mmol/g. In addition, 10 g of KL was put into a high-pressure glass flask, 50 mL of NaOH solution (0.8 M) was added and dissolved under magnetic stirring, then 1.5 mL of formaldehyde was added, and after magnetic stirred at 70 °C for 1.5 h, 2 g of Na 2 SO 3 was added and heated at 95 °C for 3 h to obtain SL 2. The content of sulfonate group in SL 2 was 0.9 mmol/g.

Preparation of C-SL-G organohydrogels

C-SL-G organohydrogels were prepared by simple gelation and solvent exchange. Briefly, the required amounts of chitosan (3%, w/v) and gelatin (15%, w/v) were dissolved in acetic acid aqueous solution (1%, v/v). The solution was stirred at 60 °C and then poured into the mold to form the original C-G composite hydrogel at 4 °C. The preformed hydrogels were further immersed in different concentrations of SL-EG solutions for 2–12 h (depending on sample size) to obtain C-SL-G organohydrogels.

### Fatigue-resistant adhesion of hydrogels [^5f7baa30]. Nature Communications (2020). High credibility.

Measurement of interfacial toughness and interfacial fatigue threshold

The interfacial toughness of various hydrogel adhesions was measured using the standard 90° peeling test (ASTM D2861) with a mechanical testing machine (2 kN load cell; Zwick/Roell Z2.5) and 90° peeling fixture (TestResources, G50). As a rigid backing during peeling, a nylon film was bonded on the top of hydrogel with superglue (Loctite, 1405419). All 90° peeling tests were performed on swollen hydrogels immersed in a deionized water bath or DPBS at a constant loading speed of 120 mm min −1. The interfacial toughness was measured as Γ = F s / W, where F s is the steady-state peeling force and W is the width of the hydrogel sample.

To quantify the interfacial fatigue threshold of the hydrogel adhesion to various substrates, we further performed the 90° peeling test under cyclic loading (force control mode) using the same experiment setup as the standard 90° peeling test. In a multiple-cycle peeling test, we applied the cyclic peeling force with an amplitude of F a (F a < F s) over N cycles, and the interfacial crack extension c were recorded from the testing machine as a function of cycle number N. Accordingly, the applied energy release rate was calculated as G = F a / W, and the interfacial crack propagation rate as d c /d N. The multiple-cycle peeling test was performed at varied applied force amplitudes to give a plot of d c /d N versus G. By linearly extrapolating the plot of d c /d N versus G to the x -intercept, we obtained the interfacial fatigue threshold Γ 0, measured under this condition.

FRMS management approach — proactive fatigue forecasting and correction: There is a danger that the fatigue management steering committee will adopt a reactive approach to fatigue management, taking constructive action only in response to reports of fatigue or fatigue-related adverse events. The more effective approach is to minimize fatigue by using available tools to forecast potential fatigue well in advance of actual operations, and taking corrective action to proactively eliminate potentially fatiguing schedules or conditions prior to their occurrence. An indicator of a highly effective FRMS is the frequency of such proactive corrective actions.

3.4 Reprocessing of Cotton Glove Liners

A total of 10.2% (n = 9/88) of the participants from the healthcare sector reported having used the possibility of reprocessing the COT‐GLs in a professional textile laundry (workplace facility: n = 5, external service: n = 1, missing information: n = 3). Among them were three hospital nurses, two geriatric nurses, two cleaners, one housekeeper and one foot care specialist. One third of them stated that initiating this reprocessing process required substantial efforts (e.g. arrangements with supervisors) (37.5%, n = 3/8). The average frequency of professional cleaning with subsequent reuse of COT‐GLs was 8.1 times (range: 4–12.5 times, n = 4). The whole procedure of washing the GLs by a professional textile laundry took an average of 3.5 days (drop‐off to return) (range: 0.5–14 days, n = 6). The majority of participants reported having used their washing machine at home and regular washing detergents to clean the COT‐GLs (90.9%, n = 80/88), among them the majority of hospital nurses (n = 15/18) and geriatric nurses (n = 21/23). 60.8% (n = 48/79) put them in a special laundry bag and 26.9% washed them together with the private laundry (n = 21/78). The average frequency of cleaning with subsequent reuse with this method was 8.7 times (range: 1–100 times, n = 69). Six participants in the COT group used both types of washing procedures (professional textile laundry and washing machine at home) (6.8%, n = 6/88). More than three quarters of the participants stated that they had noticed changes in the material after washing (n = 79), including shrinking (49.4%, n = 39), change of touch or wearing comfort (40.5%, n = 32) and damage (e.g. holes, loose threads) (30.4%, n = 24).

### Fibrin glue for the treatment of fistulae in ano – a method worth sticking to? [^bdcce497]. Colorectal Disease (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

The current evidence for fibrin glue as a treatment for anal fistulae is mixed. This study reviews the experience of fibrin glue as a treatment for anal fistulae in a single tertiary referral centre and attempts to identify factors related to failure of therapy and the length of follow-up required.

Method

Patients with fistulae in ano that were treated with fibrin glue between February 2004 and August 2008 were analysed. All procedures were performed by two colorectal consultants based at the Queens Medical Centre, Nottingham. All patients were followed-up to assess the outcome of this treatment.

Results

Forty patients (21 male, 19 female) with a mean age of 46.5 years were studied. The mean duration of symptoms prior to presentation was 39 months (range 4–240 months). Presenting symptoms included perianal discharge (72.5%), perianal abscess (57.5%), pain (12.5%), PR bleeding (7.5%), itching (5%) and urgency (2.5%). Patients had a minimum of two follow-up appointments and the median follow-up period was 5.2 months (range 1–16 months). Following MRI and operative assessment, 28 (70%) of the 40 fistulae were considered complex (high trans-sphincteric, extra-sphincteric, pouch-vaginal). Patients who had inflammatory bowel disease were classified as simple tracts but all failed to heal (three patients). Twenty of the complex fistulae failed to heal. Three patients who had repeat application of glue for their complex fistulae failed to heal on follow-up. Of the remaining 12 patients who had simple fistulae in ano, five (41.7%) healed completely. There were no complications such as abscess, related to treatment. All patients who were asymptomatic at 3 months did not develop any further recurrence.

Conclusion

Fibrin glue is a simple treatment strategy, preserves sphincter function with minimal adverse side effects. It should therefore be considered as possible first line treatment in simple fistulae but it is less likely to be successful in complex or those fistulae associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Repeat gluing is unlikely to be successful. Fistulae that have failed to heal by 3 months will need further treatment.

### Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on individuals with chemical intolerance [^ddafe5b7]. Family Medicine and Community Health (2025). Medium credibility.

Chemical intolerance

CI develops through exposures to environmental toxins, either through a single large exposure event, or through persistent low-dose exposures over time. Many CI symptoms are similar to those of COVID-19, including respiratory problems, fatigue, mood changes, muscle pain, headache, gastrointestinal problems and difficulties with concentration and/or memory.

Prevalence estimates depend on whether CI is clinically diagnosed (0.5%–6.5%) or self-reported (averaging ~20%). Recent estimates from a 2018 nationally representative US population study report prevalence estimates of 25.9% for self-reported CI, and 12.8% for medically diagnosed CI. These temporal estimates indicate an increasing prevalence rate of over 200% for self-reported CI and over 300% for medically diagnosed CI, in just the past several years. In 2018, researchers in Japan corroborated the US findings. Using the Quick Environmental Exposure and Sensitivity Inventory (QEESI), they report that the scores for CIs significantly increased over time. It is believed that the increased prevalence has been attributed to modern lifestyle exposures including industrialised processed foods.

Studies show that those afflicted with CI attribute the initiation to well-defined exposure events, including indoor air contaminants from a multitude of fragranced personal care and/or household cleaning products, pesticide use, new construction and/or mould growth.

### Managing blunt cardiac injury [^cea4c03e]. Journal of Cardiothoracic Surgery (2023). Medium credibility.

Even following prompt diagnosis, subsequent surgical management remains quite challenging for several reasons. First, patients generally have marked hemodynamic instability and are thus considered to be an extremely high-risk surgical candidates. Induction agents with cardio-depressive effects and positive pressure ventilation following intubation may further compromise cardiac function in patients with these injuries. If possible, it may be beneficial to delay intubation until the patient is in the operating room. The results from available case series in the literature regarding patients who undergo surgery suggest that the degree of preoperative haemodynamic instability may be the most important predictor of outcome, with survival rates ranging from 39 to 100%.

Regarding surgery, the location of the rupture site can be very elusive and paradoxically aggravated by the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. In an effort to ease identification of the culprit region of myocardium, surgical approaches are now frequently being performed off-pump. Following identification of the lesion, well-performed cardiorrhaphy and appropriate selection and use of surgical materials will aid in the acute surgical management. Noncutting sutures used in a buttress technique plus the use of artificial patches and glues have been well documented in providing adequate closure options. The major technical issue with the surgical repair of a rupture involves the weakened state of the surrounding myocardium, where the weakened tissue serves as a very poor scaffold site for suturing. Contemporary techniques have overcome this issue through the use of a Dacron or Teflon patches, which are large enough to cover the area of rupture and surrounding weakened tissue and incorporate the neighbouring viable myocardium, as also noted in ruptures post infarct. The patch, which can be applied without sutures using cyanoacrylate glue, results in a stable seal that stops the myocardial leak while preserving the original left ventricular cavity size. The off-pump sutureless patch technique appears to be the favoured surgical approach for the management of left ventricular free wall rupture.

L‑carnitine for cancer-related fatigue (CRF) during cancer therapy: One randomized controlled trial in invasive malignancies (N = 376) screened for fatigue found that after 4 weeks, differences in fatigue were not statistically significant between those receiving 1 g oral liquid L‑carnitine twice daily or placebo. The trial was at high risk of bias due to unclear ITT analysis methods and high loss to follow-up, and evidence from one adequately powered trial failed to show benefit.

### The longitudinal relationship of hemoglobin, fatigue and quality of life in anemic cancer patients: results from five randomized clinical trials [^1655a714]. Annals of Oncology (2004). Low credibility.

Background

Anemia is common in cancer and has been associated with fatigue and reduced health-related quality of life (HRQOL). We report the association between hemoglobin and fatigue and the impact of reducing fatigue on several domains of HRQOL.

Patients and Methods

These analyses were based on five randomized trials. Patients completed the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) Anemia scales and numeric rating scales of Energy, Activity and Overall Health at baseline and after the 12-week treatment period. t-tests and linear regression models were used to evaluate associations. Analyses were stratified into three groups: solid tumor chemotherapy patients, lymphoproliferative malignancy chemotherapy patients and non-chemotherapy patients.

Results

Adjusted mean differences (95% CI) in FACT Fatigue change scores between hemoglobin responders (≥ 2 g/dl increase) and non-responders were 3.0 (1.2, 4.7), 2.8 (0.6, 5.0) and 5.8 (2.2, 9.5) among the solid tumor, lymphoproliferative malignancy and non-chemotherapy groups, respectively. Significantly greater improvements (P < 0.01) were observed in the FACT well-being scales for patients with meaningful improvement in fatigue (FACT Fatigue change score ≥ 3 points). After controlling for other factors, patients whose fatigue improved reported substantially greater improvements in energy, ability to perform usual activities and overall health (P < 0.0001).

Conclusions

Across five trials of cancer patients on and off chemotherapy, hemoglobin response was associated with meaningful improvements in fatigue, which, in turn, was associated with improved physical, functional, emotional and overall well-being.

### Full-thickness skin necrosis of the fingertip after application of superglue [^2ce12d6a]. The Journal of Hand Surgery (2003). Low credibility.

We present the case of a 39-year-old woman who applied superglue to her fingertip as a treatment for dry skin. She developed full-thickness necrosis of her thumb pad complicated by a secondary superinfection. This necrosis occurred from the degradation of the cyanoacrylate in the superglue compound to formaldehyde, causing local histotoxicity. This injury necessitated a local flap for coverage, which healed uneventfully and without lasting sequelae.

1 Case Report

A 74‐year‐old non atopic retired male presented with weeping dermatitis that had been recurring for almost 2 years. His past medical history included vitiligo and osteoarthritis. The symptoms of his dermatitis had started a few weeks after repeated bi‐weekly physiotherapy under ultrasound (US) guidance which included the topical application of LCH Supragel (Turkuaz, Istanbul, Turkey) always on the back, lower and upper extremities. After each application the gel was wiped off, without being completely cleaned and removed. He had already consulted several dermatologists and symptoms improved with topical corticosteroids yet reappeared upon discontinuation. Upon clinical examination, he had pruritic, erythematous oozing dermatitis affecting the lower back, buttocks, upper and lower limbs (Figure 1A, B).

FIGURE 1
Weeping dermatitis on the upper extremities (A), lower back and buttocks (B) following the use of ultrasound gel. Strong positive patch tests reactions on Day 3 to MCI/MI and MI (C).

The US gel was labelled as 'no formaldehyde, paraben free, salt free, PVC free, water soluble' without a list of ingredients. The safety data sheet (SDS) declared the contents as methylchloroisothiazolinone(MCI)/methylisothiazolinone(MI), carbomer, triethanolamine, monopropylene glycol.

Patch tests were performed with the European baseline, cosmetics and plastics/glues series (Chemotechnique Diagnostics, Vellinge, Sweden) using IQ‐Ultra chambers (Chemotechnique Diagnostics) on Hypafix tape (BSN medical, Stockholm, Sweden). A semi‐open test was performed with LCH Supragel 'as is'. Readings per ESCD guidelines showed positive reactions on day(D) 2 and D3 to MCI/MI (+++) 0.02% aq. and to MI alone (+++) 0.2% aq. (with MCI/MI > MI) (Figure 1C), benzisiothiazolinone (+), dimethylaminopropylamine (++). No reaction was observed with triethanolamine and propylene glycol. Carbomer was not tested. The semi‐open test with LCH Supragel was positive (+) on D3.

The dermatitis healed completely with topical corticosteroids and avoidance of the US gel.
