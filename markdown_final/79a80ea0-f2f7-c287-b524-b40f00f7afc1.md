## Question

What does estradiol less than 12 mean

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking what an estradiol level less than 12 pg/mL means and how to interpret it. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about the assay context and whether this value was measured by a modern, sensitive method. Then, I should verify the expected range for untreated postmenopausal women. Next, I will consider clinical context such as menopausal status, symptoms, and medications. After that, I should review thresholds linked to breast cancer risk and bone health. Finally, I will synthesize a practical interpretation and outline next steps, including when to repeat testing or consider treatment, with appropriate caveats about assay variability and clinical judgment.

> Let me first confirm the assay context, because interpretation hinges on it. Older immunoassays often overestimate estradiol at low concentrations, whereas liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) provides more accurate quantification in the postmenopausal range; thus, a value of < 12 pg/mL could reflect true suppression or simply assay artifact if measured by a less specific method, so I need to check the laboratory platform before concluding anything definitive [^9c8a28a6] [^21b8a4d7].

> Next, I should review the expected range in untreated postmenopausal women. Contemporary data using LC-MS/MS show mean basal estradiol around 3.1–4.9 pg/mL with a 95% confidence interval extending up to about 10.7 pg/mL, so a result < 12 pg/mL sits within or just above the upper bound of normal for untreated postmenopausal women, and importantly, many untreated women have levels that are undetectable to low single digits, which reinforces that < 12 pg/mL is not inherently abnormal in this population [^21b8a4d7] [^df3829e7] [^e0e0106e].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions; I need to consider menopausal status and clinical context. In perimenopause, estradiol fluctuates widely, so a single low value may not reliably indicate menopause, whereas in confirmed postmenopause, < 12 pg/mL aligns with the expected low endogenous state; in contrast, in premenopausal women, such a value would be inappropriately low and suggest hypoestrogenism or assay issues, so I should confirm menstrual history and, when uncertain, pair estradiol with FSH and LH to clarify ovarian status [^53537f97] [^ffdacff4] [^0937dde1].

> I will now examine disease-specific thresholds that sometimes get conflated with "normal". A commonly cited breast cancer risk threshold of 2.7 pg/mL comes from the MORE trial, where women with estradiol > 2.7 pg/mL had higher incident breast cancer risk; however, that cutoff was derived with older assays and should not be used to define a "normal" postmenopausal range, even though it remains a research anchor for risk stratification in some contexts [^c569274d] [^9a9a25f0] [^92104587].

> Let me consider bone health implications, because very low estradiol can signal higher bone turnover. In elderly women, total estradiol < 9 pg/mL has been associated with lower bone mineral density and faster bone loss, and those with the lowest tertile of bioavailable estradiol had greater bone marker activation; thus, if a patient with < 12 pg/mL has risk factors for osteoporosis or fracture, I should evaluate bone health and consider whether estrogen therapy is indicated for prevention, balancing risks and benefits [^c74b1dcf].

> But wait, what if the low value reflects treatment effects rather than endogenous status. With aromatase inhibitor therapy, estradiol is typically suppressed to very low or undetectable levels, and even low-dose vaginal estrogen can transiently raise systemic estradiol; in this scenario, < 12 pg/mL may reflect successful suppression, and any decision to add local estrogen should be individualized and coordinated with oncology, given the potential for transient increases in circulating estradiol with some vaginal products [^8a203215] [^90bdfed2] [^13908e49].

> I should double-check the practical next steps. If the clinical question is menopausal confirmation, I should repeat estradiol with FSH and LH, ideally using a standardized LC-MS/MS assay, and interpret patterns rather than a single value; if the question is symptom management, I should treat based on symptoms and risk profile rather than chasing a numeric estradiol target, reserving repeat testing for cases of inadequate response or diagnostic uncertainty; if the question is breast cancer risk, I can consider the 2.7 pg/mL threshold as a research marker but not as a diagnostic boundary, and counsel on modifiable risks and risk-reducing strategies accordingly [^ffdacff4] [^6ecf6c8b] [^c569274d].

> In summary, estradiol < 12 pg/mL most often reflects a normal postmenopausal state when measured by modern assays, may indicate very low estrogen in perimenopause or premenopause that warrants evaluation, can signal increased bone turnover risk at the lowest extremes, and should be interpreted alongside clinical context, assay methodology, and, when needed, gonadotropins to guide diagnosis and management rather than used as a standalone arbiter of disease or treatment response [^21b8a4d7] [^53537f97] [^c74b1dcf] [^ffdacff4].

Estradiol less than 12 pg/mL means **very low estrogen** — typical of postmenopause or ovarian suppression — and is **not concerning by itself**. In postmenopausal women, this level is expected and usually needs no treatment unless there are symptoms. In premenopausal women, it suggests **hypoestrogenism** (e.g. POI, hypothalamic amenorrhea, or medication effects) and warrants evaluation of causes and symptoms. Clinical context and symptoms guide next steps, not the number alone [^ffdacff4] [^e93e8fa8].

---

## Physiological significance of estradiol less than 12 pg/mL

Estradiol is the **primary estrogen** in reproductive-age women, with levels varying across the menstrual cycle: follicular phase 30–100 pg/mL, mid-cycle peak 100–300 pg/mL, and luteal phase 60–150 pg/mL. After menopause, ovarian estradiol production ceases and levels drop to **typically < 20 pg/mL**, often < 10 pg/mL [^21b8a4d7]. Thus, estradiol < 12 pg/mL is expected in postmenopause and reflects profound estrogen deficiency in premenopausal women [^b9414514].

---

## Clinical implications in different populations

### Postmenopausal women

In postmenopausal women, estradiol < 12 pg/mL is **normal** and reflects the expected hypoestrogenic state. Low estradiol underlies menopausal symptoms (hot flashes, vaginal dryness, osteoporosis risk), but the level itself is not alarming and does not dictate treatment; management is symptom-driven and risk-based [^ffdacff4].

---

### Premenopausal women

In premenopausal women, estradiol < 12 pg/mL is **abnormally low** and indicates hypoestrogenism. Causes include:

- **Premature ovarian insufficiency (POI)**: Loss of ovarian function before age 40 with low estradiol and elevated gonadotropins [^e93e8fa8].
- **Hypothalamic amenorrhea**: Functional suppression of the HPO axis (stress, excessive exercise, low weight) [^notfound].
- **Medications**: GnRH agonists, aromatase inhibitors, or chemotherapy can suppress estradiol [^13908e49].

Persistent low estradiol in this group can cause **vasomotor symptoms, vaginal atrophy, infertility, and accelerated bone loss**; evaluation and targeted therapy are indicated [^ffdacff4].

---

## Clinical implications in specific medical conditions

### Breast cancer

In hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, **estradiol < 12 pg/mL** is often a therapeutic goal during adjuvant endocrine therapy (e.g. aromatase inhibitors), indicating effective ovarian suppression or inhibition of estrogen synthesis. Serial estradiol monitoring helps ensure adequate suppression, especially in perimenopausal patients or when ovarian function is uncertain [^6ecf6c8b] [^5d42f559].

---

### Osteoporosis

Low estradiol is associated with **increased bone resorption and osteoporosis risk**. In postmenopausal women, low estradiol contributes to bone loss; in premenopausal women with sustained low estradiol, bone health should be assessed and managed proactively [^c74b1dcf].

---

## Factors influencing estradiol levels

Several factors can **lower estradiol**:

| **Factor** | **Mechanism** |
|-|-|
| Age | Declining ovarian function |
| Menopause | Cessation of ovarian estradiol production |
| Medications | GnRH agonists, aromatase inhibitors, chemotherapy |
| Lifestyle | Excessive exercise, low body weight, stress |
| Medical conditions | POI, hypothalamic amenorrhea, pituitary disorders |

---

## Clinical management and follow-up

Management depends on **context and symptoms**:

- **Postmenopausal women**: Treat only if symptomatic or at risk (e.g. osteoporosis); use the lowest effective dose of local or systemic estrogen with shared decision-making [^ffdacff4] [^50c48afa].
- **Premenopausal women**: Evaluate causes (e.g. POI, hypothalamic amenorrhea), address reversible factors, and consider hormone replacement if indicated (e.g. bone health, symptom control) [^e93e8fa8].
- **Breast cancer patients**: Monitor estradiol to confirm suppression; adjust therapy if levels rise unexpectedly [^6ecf6c8b].

---

## Limitations of estradiol measurement

Accurate measurement at low levels is challenging; **immunoassays** can overestimate, whereas **LC-MS/MS** is more specific and sensitive. Results should be interpreted in clinical context and, when possible, measured with standardized assays [^9c8a28a6] [^21b8a4d7].

---

Estradiol < 12 pg/mL reflects **very low estrogen**: normal after menopause and pathologic in premenopausal women. Interpretation must be **context-specific**, with management guided by symptoms, age, and underlying causes rather than the absolute value alone.

### Systemic estradiol levels with low-dose vaginal estrogens [^df3829e7]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Mean basal levels of systemic estradiol in normal, generally healthy, untreated, postmenopausal women are approximately 3.9 pg/mL based on the mean estradiol levels reported in published clinical studies - (Fig. 1) using LC or GC with MS to detect serum estradiol. Published standard deviations (SDs) from mean estradiol levels in postmenopausal women ranged from 0.15 to 3.4 for various treatment groups (including placebo) at baseline, - from 3.0 to 12.5 for untreated or control womenwith or without VVA, and 0.4 to 3.2 from women using placebo (at time-points other than baseline). One studyreported an SD of 12.5 in one group of patients, with SDs of 3.03 and 3.29 in the other two groups, suggesting that the SD of 12.5 is an outlier, and as such, was discarded from our estimated range of normal estradiol levels. From the full SD range of 0.15 to 3.4, - conservatively calculating a 95% confidence interval (CI) from the largest SD of ± 3.4 (3.4 × 2 = 6.8), and then adding and subtracting 6.8 to and from a mean of 3.9 (average of mean estradiol levels reported in clinical studies of Fig. 1) gives an estimated range of undetectable to 10.7 pg/mL. As discussed below, this normal range would only be a preliminary estimate with the requirement to update it with a large number of samples measured with a state-of-the-art assay, including women without VVA and specifically identifying women having undergone oophorectomy.

Hormonal treatment options — If nonhormonal treatments have failed to adequately address symptoms, after discussion of risks and benefits, low-dose vaginal estrogen may be used in individuals with a history of breast cancer, including those taking tamoxifen, and for individuals taking aromatase inhibitors (AIs), low-dose vaginal estrogen can be used after shared decision making between the patient, gynecologist, and oncologist. Low-dose options include an estradiol-releasing vaginal ring, 10-microgram estradiol vaginal tablets or inserts, and comparable low doses of vaginal estrogen cream, with formulations associated with serum estradiol levels of less than 20 pg/mL being the 4-microgram estradiol insert, 7.5-microgram estradiol ring, and 10-microgram estradiol inserts and tablets; other regimens reviewed were estriol 0.25 mg twice a week and 12.5-microgram estradiol vaginal tablets twice a week. To date, there is no evidence to indicate harm from these local treatments, and when serum estradiol levels were evaluated in 10 studies on AIs, most showed only a transient increase resolving within 12 weeks or no increase at all, with only one study reporting sustained increases in two of six participants at 7 and 12 weeks of use.

### Systemic estradiol levels with low-dose vaginal estrogens [^21b8a4d7]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Textbooks report peak normal levels of serum estradiol as ≤ 20 to 30 pg/mL in postmenopausal women; however, these values were established in older studies with less specific assays, such as RIAs, and should be revised with values from studies using more specific and sensitive assays with less cross-reactivities. Here we reviewed the systemic estradiol levels that we believe would best represent those of normal, untreated, postmenopausal women. Mean estradiol levels from those studies were used to calculate a mean basal level (3.9 pg/mL), with the range of basal estradiol levels for the normal, untreated postmenopausal woman found to be undetectable to 10.7 pg/mL using the 95% CI from the highest published SD (± 3.4). Thus, we propose a more current, sensitive mean level of circulating estradiol in normal, untreated women to range from undetectable to 10.7 pg/mL, which we believe to be more accurate than the well-accepted earlier level of ≤ 20 to 30 pg/mL; yet it is still only an estimate.

An important principle is that assay methods for serum estradiol assessment need to be standardized to be able to accurately, systematically, and consistently measure the low levels of estradiol in postmenopausal women. A single estradiol standard that can be traceable for each biological fluid in which estradiol is measured is needed, although some of the larger commercial laboratories have made strides to overcoming this obstacle. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Laboratory/Manufacturer Hormone Standardization (HoSt) Program, endorsed by 14 medical societies, was initiated in 2014 to help provide more accurate and precise hormone measurements used in patient care and research. The program assesses laboratory methodology and performance by comparing laboratory's specimen measurements with those of their reference LC/MS/MS method. Progress towards developing accurate, sensitive, and specific assays to measure the very low levels of estradiol in postmenopausal women continues.

### Estradiol transdermal (estradiol) [^89486aeb]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

12.1 Mechanism of Action

Endogenous estrogens are largely responsible for the development and maintenance of the female reproductive system and secondary sexual characteristics. Although circulating estrogens exist in a dynamic equilibrium of metabolic interconversions, estradiol is the principal intracellular human estrogen and is substantially more potent than its metabolites, estrone and estriol, at the receptor level.

The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, which is secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.

Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen-responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.

Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH, through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated levels of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Generally, a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman's therapeutic response to estradiol gel nor her risk for adverse outcomes. Likewise, exposure comparisons across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid.

Figure.
Serum Concentrations of Estradiol at Enrollment and 12 Weeks in Participants of the MsFLASH Vaginal Health Randomized Clinical Trial

The box plots represent the median and IQR of values at enrollment and week 12. Each triangle represents a measurement from an individual participant, and the lines connect the pretreatment and week 12 values for each participant assigned to the vaginal estradiol, 10-µg, tablet plus placebo gel (n = 88) group (A) or the dual-placebo group (n = 86) (B). This summary does not include 2 participants who received placebo with unusually large estradiol levels (baseline: 40.3 pg/mL; week 12, 3.4 pg/mL and baseline, 7.4 pg/mL; week 12, 52.0 pg/mL).

When adjusted for pretreatment estradiol concentrations, assignment to the vaginal estrogen vs placebo treatment group was significantly associated with a higher week 12 estradiol concentration (24.5% difference; 95% CI, 6.6%-45.5%). Adjusting for age, clinical site, and BMI did not substantially alter this estimate (23.8% difference; 95% CI, 6.9%-43.3%) (Table 2). Model results were similar when limited to a subset of treatment-adherent participants. As expected from the univariate analysis, multivariable regression revealed no associations between treatment group week 12 serum estrone or SHBG concentrations (Table 2).

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^6ecf6c8b]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Invasive breast cancer — definition of menopause and diagnostic criteria state that menopause is the permanent cessation of menses and includes a profound and permanent decrease in ovarian estrogen synthesis, and is usually a clinical diagnosis made after ≥ 12 months of amenorrhea; natural menopause is experienced between ages 42–58 years. In those who are premenopausal at the beginning of chemotherapy and who develop chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea, ovarian function may still be intact or may resume over time, with the likelihood of resuming after chemotherapy higher among those aged < 40 years. Twelve months of amenorrhea alone is insufficient to diagnose menopause with chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea or with tamoxifen or ovarian suppression; FSH and estradiol levels are used to support the diagnosis of menopause, and FSH and estradiol should be repeated serially to ensure menopausal status in patients with chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea. Reasonable criteria for determining menopause in patients with breast cancer include any of the following: Prior bilateral oophorectomy; Age ≥ 60 years; Age < 60 with amenorrhea for ≥ 12 months in the absence of prior chemotherapy, receipt of tamoxifen, toremifene, or ovarian suppression and estradiol and FSH in the postmenopausal range; Age < 60 years: chemotherapy-induced amenorrhea for ≥ 12 months with FSH and estradiol in post-menopausal range on serial assessments; Age < 60 years: on tamoxifen with FSH and estradiol level in postmenopausal range. Menopausal status cannot be determined in those receiving ovarian function suppression. All recommendations are category 2A unless otherwise indicated.

Table 2.
Associations Between Treatment Group and Week 12 Hormone Concentrations

Abbreviation: SHBG, sex hormone–binding globulin.

SI conversion: to convert estradiol to picomoles per liter, multiply by 3.671; estrone to picomoles per liter, multiply by 3.698; SHBG to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 8.896.

To better evaluate the potential clinical relevance of this association, we compared characteristics between women with 12-week estradiol concentrations higher than vs lower than or equal to the value (2.7 pg/mL) previously shown to be associated with an increased risk for breast cancer. A 12-week serum estradiol concentration higher than 2.7 pg/mL was associated with higher BMI, higher baseline serum concentrations of estradiol and estrone, and lower vaginal pH at enrollment (Table 3). Of note, 121 of 174 participants (69.5%) entered the trial with serum estradiol levels above this threshold. Of those starting at or below the threshold of 2.7 pg/mL, 38.1% (8 of 21) in the vaginal estrogen group and 34.4% (11 of 32) in the placebo group had estradiol concentrations higher than 2.7 pg/mL after 12 weeks of study participation (P = 0.78). Of participants with a starting concentration above 2.7 pg/mL, a similar proportion in each group (3 of 21 [4.3.%] vs 4 of 54 [7.4%]; P = 0.49) had a week 12 concentration below that threshold.

### Systemic estradiol levels with low-dose vaginal estrogens [^f1804f75]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Our review of systemic absorption of estradiol with use of low-dose and ultralow-dose vaginal estrogen therapies found low to negligible amounts of circulating estradiol that may be influenced by product formulation and vaginal placement. This minimal systemic absorption of estradiol with proven efficacy of lower-dose products may be a relevant point when counseling postmenopausal women for the treatment of moderate to severe VVA symptoms. We also propose a more updated basal level of estradiol in normal, untreated postmenopausal women based on levels found in postmenopausal women who are not treated with any hormone therapy. A more accurate level will likely be established with the further standardization of estradiol assays designed to detect minimal amounts of estradiol such as those found in postmenopausal women.

### The AUA / SUFU / AUGS guideline on genitourinary syndrome of menopause [^b8c0c527]. The Journal of Urology (2025). High credibility.

AUA/SUFU/AUGS guideline — breast cancer risk with local low-dose vaginal estrogen is summarized as: Clinicians should inform patients of the absence of evidence linking local low-dose vaginal estrogen to the development of breast cancer (Expert Opinion). Since that time, there has been a growing body of evidence that local low-dose vaginal estrogen does not increase the risk for primary breast cancer or recurrence of breast cancer in women with a personal history of breast cancer. Per the National Cancer Institute, a woman's lifetime risk for developing breast cancer is 12.9%, and individuals with less than a 15% lifetime risk are considered average risk while those with > 20% lifetime risk are considered high risk. In a secondary review of the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study that included 45,633 women without prior history of breast or endometrial cancer and not on systemic estrogen therapy, those with self-reported use of local low-dose vaginal estrogen during the follow up period did not have higher risk for breast cancer, stroke, endometrial cancer, colorectal cancer, or venous thromboembolism, and the risk for coronary artery disease and all-cause mortality were likewise lower in the local low-dose vaginal estrogen users. Although systemic levels of estradiol may increase briefly after starting local low-dose vaginal estrogen, the levels return to menopausal levels after 12 weeks; serum levels with 10mcg tablet and vaginal ring remain in the menopausal range, and in general local low-dose vaginal estrogen results in negligible serum levels of estradiol and thus does not increase risk for breast cancer. There is a dearth of data on patients who are at moderate to high risk for breast cancer and their risk for developing breast cancer as a result of using local low-dose vaginal estrogen.

### Association of vaginal estradiol tablet with serum estrogen levels in women who are postmenopausal: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^9a9a25f0]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

There are very few data to help define a safe systemic estradiol concentration after menopause. Serum estrogen levels are associated with individual participant characteristics, including body mass index (BMI). A systematic review found that common vaginal estrogen treatment regimens are associated with posttreatment mean estradiol concentrations ranging from 8.6 to 30 pg/mL (to convert to picomoles per liter, multiply by 3.671), depending on the type of estrogen product and type of assay used to measure the hormone. A meta-analysis of breast cancer risk with endogenous hormone concentrationsused data from 9 studies with median serum estradiol levels ranging from 5.9 to 36.5 pg/mL and suggested greater risk for breast cancer with higher serum estradiol or estrone levels. In a randomized clinical trial of 7290 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, those randomly assigned to placebo with baseline serum estradiol concentrations higher than 2.7 pg/mL had a significantly greater risk (6.8-fold higher) for breast cancer during 4 years compared with those with baseline concentrations lower than or equal to 2.72 pg/mL. Also, randomization to raloxifene treatment significantly reduced breast cancer risk compared with placebo, but only in the subset of women with baseline estradiol levels higher than 2.72 pg/mL. These results suggest that concentrations above this threshold may be associated with an increased risk for breast cancer.

We hypothesized that use of vaginal estrogen in women with bothersome vaginal symptoms would not lead to a significant increase in serum estradiol concentrations at 12 weeks. To test this hypothesis, we compared change in serum estradiol, estrone, and sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations during 12 weeks of treatment in the active vs placebo groups of a randomized clinical trial of a vaginal estradiol tablet for treatment of postmenopausal vaginal discomfort. We included SHBG because lower levels have independently been associated with cardiovascular risk, and because oral estrogen treatment has been shown to increase SHBG levels. Because of the high level of imprecision and nonspecificity of estradiol and estrone immunoassays in the low range prevalent among women during menopause, we measured these hormones using a highly sensitive liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry assay, certified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Hormone Standardization (HoSt) Program.

The primary source of estrogen in normally cycling adult women is the ovarian follicle, which secretes 70 to 500 mcg of estradiol daily, depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle. After menopause, most endogenous estrogen is produced by conversion of androstenedione, secreted by the adrenal cortex, to estrone in the peripheral tissues. Thus, estrone and the sulfate conjugated form, estrone sulfate, are the most abundant circulating estrogens in postmenopausal women.

Estrogens act through binding to nuclear receptors in estrogen responsive tissues. To date, two estrogen receptors have been identified. These vary in proportion from tissue to tissue.

Circulating estrogens modulate the pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) through a negative feedback mechanism. Estrogens act to reduce the elevated concentrations of these hormones seen in postmenopausal women.

12.2 Pharmacodynamics

Generally, a serum estrogen concentration does not predict an individual woman's therapeutic response to MINIVELLE nor her risk for adverse outcomes. Likewise, exposure comparisons across different estrogen products to infer efficacy or safety for the individual woman may not be valid.

Measurement of Serum Analytes

Serum total estradiol and total estrone concentrations were measured in 2020 by the Brigham Research Assay Core Laboratory using a liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method certified by the HoSt Program. For the estradiol and estrone assays, the lower limit of quantitation was 1 pg/mL (linear range, 1–500 pg/mL); the intraassay coefficient of variation was less than 5%, and the interassay coefficient of variation was less than 12%. For the LC-MS/MS estradiol assay, the mean bias for quality control specimens provided by the HoSt Program was 0.81 pg/mL for estradiol concentrations lower than or equal to 20 mg/mL and 1.9% for specimens with estradiol concentrations higher than 20 pg/mL. The imprecision was 4.6% in HoSt Program quality control pools with concentrations ranging from 2.6 to 24.2 pg/mL, 3.8% in the concentration range of 27.7 to 39.3 pg/mL, and 3.7% in the concentration range of 39.4 to 230.0 pg/mL.

Statistical Analysis

We compared week 12 values of the 3 analytes according to categories of participant characteristics at enrollment and treatment assignment via analysis of variance (F tests). Linear regression models (Wald statistics) were used to evaluate the treatment assignment in week 12 analyte values. Model 1 adjusted for continuous baseline hormone concentration; model 2 additionally adjusted for clinical center, age (continuous), and BMI (continuous). We also compared baseline characteristics between people with week 12 estradiol levels lower than or equal to 2.7 pg/mL vs higher than 2.7 pg/mL. As sensitivity analyses, these models were also performed in the subset of participants who reported at least 80% adherence to treatment assignment.

Subgroup analyses were performed to evaluate whether the association between treatment group and week 12 serum estradiol levels varied according to levels of baseline estradiol, BMI, and years since menopause. A linear model of week 12 estradiol levels was fit for each baseline factor as a function of treatment group, the baseline factor, their interaction, and the adjustment factors from model 2 as appropriate.

Analyses were conducted using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc) with 2-sided values of P = 0.05 considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were completed between June 21, 2021, and September 23, 2022.

Early postmenopause (Stages +1a, +1b, +1c) — FSH continues to increase and estradiol decreases until approximately 2 years after the FMP, after which levels stabilize, so STRAW + 10 recommended subdivision into three substages (+1a, +1b, and +1c). Stages +1a and +1b each last 1 year; Stage +1a marks the end of the 12-month period of amenorrhea required to define that the FMP has occurred; together +1a and +1b are estimated to last, on average, 2 years and symptoms, most notably vasomotor symptoms, are most likely to occur during this stage. Stage +1c represents stabilization of high FSH and low estradiol values estimated to last 3 to 6 years; therefore, the entire early postmenopause lasts approximately 5 to 8 years.

### The range and variation in serum estradiol concentration in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women treated with transdermal estradiol in a real-world setting: a cross-sectional study [^99d1003d]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

We defined a high level as > 2,051 pmol/L based on the reference range observed in the whole cohort (2.5% of women had levels > 2,051 pmol/L). It should be emphasized that this is an arbitrary threshold that has no clinical meaning and was used purely to interrogate the relationship between dose and high levels. There was no evidence that use of off-label versus on-label doses increased the odds of a high level (P = 0.14). Higher levels were more frequently observed in younger women with higher, fluctuating endogenous estradiol levels, and in gel users with higher peak levels versus patch users, but the associations failed to reach significance at the 5% level.

Some women attending a specialist clinic use high doses to achieve high levels for therapeutic effect. For example, psychological symptoms in the menopause transition are common and can be effectively treated with HT +/− additional psychiatric support.- Limited evidence suggests that some women with severe depressive symptoms need higher estradiol levels for symptom relief. Occasionally, high doses are used to suppress ovulation in perimenopausal women with severe symptoms resulting from excessive, unpredictable hormone fluctuations. In younger women with distressing cyclical symptoms, cycle suppression is usually achieved using a combined contraceptive pill. Most combined oral contraceptives contain 30-mcg ethinyl estradiol, which is roughly dose-equivalent to a 300-mcg 17β-estradiol patch twice weekly, or 12 pumps 17β-estradiol gel daily. If using HT to suppress ovulation in perimenopausal women, 2x 100-mcg estradiol patches (200 mcg) twice weekly are usually sufficient, but higher doses may be needed in younger women and/or poor absorbers.

### Endogenous levels of serum estradiol and sex hormone binding globulin determine bone mineral density, bone remodeling, the rate of bone loss, and response to treatment with estrogen in elderly women [^c74b1dcf]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2004). Low credibility.

A total of 489 elderly women aged 65–75 yr who participated in a 3-yr, randomized, blinded osteoporosis trial underwent measurements of serum estradiol, bioavailable estradiol, and SHBG. At baseline, bone mineral density (BMD) was lower at the femoral sites (7–19%, P < 0.05), total body (6–8%, P < 0.05), and spine (5–9%, P = 0.2) in women in the lowest tertile for serum total estradiol [< 9 pg/ml (33 pmol/liter)], serum bioavailable estradiol [< 2.4 pg/ml (8.8 pmol/liter)], or highest tertile for serum SHBG (> 165 nmol/liter), compared with women in the highest tertiles of total estradiol [> 13.3 pg/ml (49 pmol/liter)] and bioavailable estradiol [> 4 pg/ml (14 pmol/liter)] or lowest tertile for SHBG (< 113 nmol/liter). Bone markers were increased in women in the lowest tertile for serum total estradiol (not significant) and bioavailable estradiol (P < 0.05) and highest tertile for SHBG (P < 0.05). In the longitudinal study, the rate of bone loss in the placebo group was significantly higher in total body (P < 0.05) and spine (P < 0.05) in women in the lowest tertile, compared with the highest tertile of serum bioavailable estradiol. After treatment with conjugated equine estrogens 0.625 mg/d, the increase in BMD was 4–6% higher at the femoral sites (P < 0.05), total body (P < 0.05), and spine (not significant), in the lowest tertile, compared with the highest tertile of serum bioavailable estradiol or highest tertile, compared with the lowest tertile of serum SHBG. In summary, small variations in endogenous serum estradiol and high serum SHBG determine differences in BMD and rate of bone loss in elderly women and also affect the response to treatment with estrogen. Women with a serum estradiol level of less than 9 pg/ml (33 pmol/liter) are optimal candidates for estrogen therapy for osteoporosis prevention.

### Systemic estradiol levels with low-dose vaginal estrogens [^9c8a28a6]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

RESULTS

Systemic estradiol levels by assay type

As values for estradiol levels vary based on the detection assay used, the best way to compare assays is to contrast mean estradiol levels reported within each assay type. Table 1 shows mean basal estradiol levels measured with RIA ranging from 3.5 pg/mL up to 10.5 pg/mL, - or below the assay detection limit (ie, < 5.5 and < 12.3). A study using ELISA — another immunologic method — reported a mean estradiol level of 7.6 pg/mL at baseline in a study of postmenopausal woman before administering a 25-μg estradiol tablet. Several more recent clinical studies (published after 2009) reported serum estradiol using LC or GC with MS or tandem MS in postmenopausal women at baseline, those treated with placebo, and those who were untreated or controls with or without VVA (Fig. 1 and Table 2). - These studies reported lower mean levels of serum estradiol than those that utilized RIA, with mean levels ranging from 2.9 to 4.9 pg/mL. -

FIG. 1
Serum estradiol levels (mean ± SD) in postmenopausal women before vaginal therapy administration or with placebo, or untreated used as a control (without or without VVA), or those from assay validation studies; only studies using MS-based assays were included. Baseline is in PMW with VVA in trials at baseline before vaginal estrogens - or DHEA; No VVA is untreated PMW without VVA in various clinical trials; VVA is untreated PMW with VVA from trials of vaginal DHEA; Placebo is PMW given placebo in vaginal therapy trials; Assay is PMW whose E2 levels were measured in assay validation studies. - DHEA, dehydroepiandrosterone; E2, 17β-estradiol; MS, mass spectroscopy; PMW, postmenopausal women; VVA, vulvar and vaginal atrophy.

Two head-to-head studies, comparing RIA with GC/MS/MS report relatively higher serum estradiol levels with RIA. In 30 postmenopausal women studied by Wang et al, mean basal estradiol levels measured by RIA were 11.9 pg/mL, whereas those measured with GC/MS/MS were 7.3 pg/mL. Another study of postmenopausal women (n = 40) by Lee et alfound mean levels of estradiol to be lower when measured by GC/MS/MS (3.8 pg/mL) than with six of seven RIAs (mean 6.5–13 pg/mL) thought to be highly sensitive and specific.

The North American Menopause Society (NAMS) organized the Workshop on Normal Ranges for Estradiol in Postmenopausal Women from September 23 to 24, 2019, in Chicago, Illinois. The aim of the workshop was to review existing analytical methodologies for measuring estradiol in postmenopausal women and to assess existing data and study cohorts of postmenopausal women for their suitability to establish normal postmenopausal ranges. The anticipated outcome of the workshop was to develop recommendations for establishing normal ranges generated with a standardized and certified assay that could be adopted by clinical and research communities. The attendees determined that the term reference range was a better descriptor than normal range for estradiol measurements in postmenopausal women. Twenty-eight speakers presented during the workshop.

### Association of vaginal estradiol tablet with serum estrogen levels in women who are postmenopausal: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^1d81f12c]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Discussion

Our analysis noted a clinically small, although statistically significant, increase in serum estradiol levels with 12 weeks of vaginal low-dose (10 µg) estradiol treatment. We also observed the probability of higher BMI as a contributor to higher circulating estrogen concentrations among women who are postmenopausal with moderate to severe vulvovaginal symptoms. Adjusting for age, BMI, and serum estradiol levels at enrollment did not attenuate the association between the use of vaginal estradiol, 10 µg, and increased serum estradiol levels. Using a cutoff value of 2.7 pg/mL, which was previously associated with a higher risk for breast cancer, we found no significant difference between the estrogen vs placebo groups in the proportion of women whose risk level changed from lower (≤ 2.7 pg/mL) to higher (> 2.7 pg/mL).

Our trial studied a vaginal estradiol, 10-µg, tablet, which has been associated with lower serum estradiol concentrations than vaginal estradiol creams. One study of a 10-µg vaginal tablet showed an initial spike above 20 pg/mL in serum estradiol concentrations 8 hours after administration on the first day of use, but otherwise low concentrations through 83 days of use. A separate study noted increasing estradiol concentrations in the hours after administration with long-term use of a vaginal 10-µg tablet, but no serum estradiol concentrations higher than 10 pg/mL. A more recent study of a vaginal estradiol softgel also showed an initial concentration spike in the hours after first administration of the medication, but a lower spike after several weeks of treatment, and no significant increase in mean circulating estradiol concentrations. A more recent study suggested that there may be greater absorption of topical hormonal preparations initially, when the mucosa is thinner and more friable. We found a suggestion of greater influence of the vaginal estradiol use on serum estradiol concentrations in women with lower starting estradiol concentrations and longer duration since menopause, which would support the hypothesis that there is greater absorption with a thinner vaginal mucosa; however, the elevations in our trial were measured at 12 weeks. We could not assess initial transient spikes as have others.

Impact of Serum Estradiol Levels on the Vaginal Microbiota and pH

We measured serum estradiol concentrations in the estradiol and placebo groups to determine whether overall differences or changes noted in the vaginal microenvironment were a response to circulating estradiol. We noted a significant increase in serum estradiol concentrations with estradiol treatment (median [IQR] estradiol, 4.0 [3.1–5.4] pg/mL at 12 weeks vs 3.6 [2.6–4.5] pg/mL at baseline; P = 0.02) but not placebo (median [IQR] estradiol, 3.1 [2.2–4.4] pg/mL at 12 weeks vs 3.1 [2.1–4.7] pg/mL at baseline; P = 0.48) (eFigure 5 in Supplement 2). No changes were noted across 12 weeks in estradiol concentrations in the low- or high-diversity subgroups (eFigure 5 in Supplement 2). Estradiol levels at baseline also did not vary significantly between estradiol and placebo groups (median [IQR] 3.6 [3.1–4.7] pg/mL vs 3.1 [2.1–4.7] pg/mL; P = 0.14), nor did estradiol levels vary between high- vs low-diversity subgroups at baseline (median [IQR], 3.6 [2.6–4.7] pg/mL vs 3.1 [2.3–4.2] pg/mL; P = 0.23) or 12 weeks (median [IQR], 3.4 [2.7–4.8] pg/mL vs 3.4 [2.6–5.0] pg/mL, P = 0.73). Interestingly, increase in serum estrogen concentration between week 12 compared with baseline (median [IQR] increase, 0.4 [−0.3 to 1.2] pg/mL) was not associated with change in SDI (median [IQR] change, –1.31 [–1.96 to –0.06]; P = 0.71) or pH (median [IQR] change, –1.5 [–2.0 to –1.0]; P = 0.27) among women using estradiol, despite significant decreases in SDI and pH in this group, suggesting that local concentrations of estradiol may play a greater role than systemic concentrations in mediating changes in the vagina.

### Association of vaginal estradiol tablet with serum estrogen levels in women who are postmenopausal: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^5d496001]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Importance

Half of women who are postmenopausal have genitourinary discomfort after menopause. Recommended therapies include low-dose vaginal estrogen. Individuals with a history of breast cancer or venous thromboembolism may have concerns about the safety of this intervention.

Objective

To compare serum estrogen concentrations with the use of vaginal estrogen, 10 μg, tablet vs placebo in women who are postmenopausal.

Design, Setting, and Participants

This is a secondary, post hoc analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial of treatment for moderate to severe genitourinary syndrome in women who are postmenopausal. The study was conducted at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute and the University of Minnesota from April 11, 2016, to April 23, 2017. Measurements and data analysis were performed from November 3, 2020, to September 23, 2022.

Interventions

Participants were randomly assigned to vaginal estradiol tablet (10 μg/d for 2 weeks and then twice weekly) plus placebo gel (3 times weekly) or dual placebo for 12 weeks.

Main Outcomes and Measures

In this post hoc analysis, baseline and week 12 serum estradiol, estrone, and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations were measured by a chemiluminescent assay. Week 12 values of the 3 analytes were compared by baseline participant characteristics. Linear models compared week 12 estradiol concentrations between treatment groups, adjusted for baseline characteristics.

Results

A total of 174 women, mean (SD) age 61 (4) years, were included. Those in the estrogen group (n = 88) were more likely to have higher geometric mean (SD) week 12 serum estradiol concentrations (4.3[2.2 pg/mL]) than those in the placebo group (n = 86) (3.5 [2.1] pg/mL) (P = 0.01). Adjusted for pretreatment hormone concentrations, age, clinical site, and body mass index, assignment to the estrogen vs placebo treatment group was significantly associated with higher week 12 estradiol concentrations (23.8% difference; 95% CI, 6.9%-43.3%). Most (121 of 174 [69.5%]) participants had enrollment serum estradiol concentrations higher than 2.7 pg/mL. Of women starting treatment at estradiol levels lower than or equal to 2.7 pg/mL, 38.1% (8 of 21) in the estrogen group and 34.4% (11 of 32) in the placebo group had estradiol concentrations higher than 2.7 pg/mL after 12 weeks of study participation (P = 0.78). Treatment assignment was not associated with week 12 estrone or SHBG concentrations.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial, a significant, although small, increase in serum estradiol levels was noted after 12 weeks of vaginal estrogen administration. The clinical relevance of this small increase is uncertain.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^dddbea37]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Menopause diagnosis and definitions — In a woman with an intact uterus, menopause is a clinical diagnosis based upon cessation of menses for at least 12 months, and sex steroids, gonadotropins, inhibin B, or anti-Mullerian hormone measurements do not further inform the diagnosis, do not indicate precisely when the final menstrual period will occur, and will not influence management unless a woman is seeking fertility. Table definitions specify that spontaneous menopause occurs at an average age of 51 y, early menopause is cessation of ovarian function between ages 40 and 45, and POI is loss of ovarian function before the age of 40 y with the prevalence of POI is approximately 1%.

Estradiol and FSH

The distribution of estradiol and FSH levels categorized into estradiol < 20 pg/mL and FSH ≥ 50 mIU/mL versus estradiol ≥ 20 pg/mL and/or FSH < 50 mIU/mL across all time points is presented in Fig. 2. The baseline percent of patients with estradiol and FSH levels in the postmenopausal range (estradiol < 20 pg/mL and FSH ≥ 50 mIU/mL) was 4.2%. This increased to 49.6% (3 months) and 52.6% (6 months), then dropped to 27.8% (12 months) and 22% (24 months). Supplementary Table 3 presents logistic regression results for predicting low estradiol and high FSH. At 6 months, there were statistically significant differences between chemotherapy regimens (P = 0.008), IHC scores (P = 0.004), and BMI groups (P < 0.0001). Obese women were less likely to have estradiol and FSH levels in the postmenopausal range as compared to women in the normal BMI range. BMI remained a statistically significant predictor at 12 months, but not at 24 months. Histologic grade was a statistically significant predictor at both 12 and 24 months (P = 0.03 at both time points), with increased odds of postmenopausal hormone levels in those with high vs low grade. ET use during the first 6 months after randomization was not available, but HR status/ET use was a statistically significant predictor at 12 and 24 months, with overall P values < 0.0001 at both time points. When considering a multivariable model at 24 months, only age and HR status/ET use (controlling for baseline estradiol and FSH level), remained statistically significant. Patients with HR‐positive cancer with reported tamoxifen use were less likely to have estradiol and FSH levels in the postmenopausal range as compared to HR‐negative patients (OR = 0.24, 95% CI = 0.15–0.39).

Monitoring of ovulation induction with gonadotropins depends on careful monitoring with serial transvaginal ultrasonography and estradiol measurements; ultrasonography generally should be performed after the first 4–5 days of treatment and at subsequent intervals of 1–3 days according to response, endometrial thickness and appearance have prognostic value, serum estradiol measured with ultrasonography informs treatment management, and multiple follicles as small as 10–12 mm at ovulation can increase the risk of multiple gestation.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^0ea3135f]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Vaginal estrogen therapy — We recommend low-dose vaginal ET. (1|⊕⊕⊕⊕) Randomized controlled trials of low-dose vaginal estrogen products report rapid improvement of vaginal and urinary symptoms within 2 to 3 weeks, with objective improvements continuing at 12 weeks and maintained to 1 year. Limited evidence suggests that vaginal ET may prevent recurrent urinary tract infections and overactive bladder. Adverse effects include potential transfer to partner via penile or oral absorption and, with vaginal creams, residue on undergarments. During the initiation of therapy, vaginal atrophy may enhance systemic absorption, and when vaginal epithelium is restored, systemic absorption may decrease. Low-dose vaginal rings result in estradiol levels that remain within the normal postmenopausal range; however, bone resorption and lipid levels decrease, suggesting possible systemic effects, and insertion and removal at 3-month intervals may be difficult. For vaginal estradiol tablets, the 10-µg tablet provides standard twice weekly dosing, relieves vaginal symptoms by 8 weeks, is effective for at least 52 weeks, and therapy is initiated with daily administration for 2 weeks then twice weekly thereafter. Intermediate-dose estradiol tablets (25-µg) increase plasma estradiol from 3.1 ± 0.83 to 19.8 ± 6.1 pg/mL by 7 days, and an RCT of CEE vaginal cream ≥ 0.3 mg applied daily or twice weekly reported improvement in VVA by 12 weeks sustained for 52 weeks without reports of endometrial effects.

### Relationship of follicle numbers and estradiol levels to multiple implantation in 3, 608 intrauterine insemination cycles [^8c348bb6]. Fertility and Sterility (2001). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine the relationship of follicle numbers and estradiol (E(2)) levels to multiple implantations in human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) and clomiphene citrate (CC) cycles.

Design

Fifteen-year prospective study.

Setting

Private infertility clinic.

Patient(S)

Women who underwent 3608 cycles of husband or donor intrauterine insemination (IUI).

Intervention(S)

Ovulation induction (OI) with CC, hMG, or CC+hMG.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Pregnancy and multiple implantations.

Result(S)

Triplet and higher-order implantations-but not twin implantations-were related to age, E(2) levels, and number of follicles ≥ 12 mm and ≥ 15 mm, but not number of follicles ≥ 18 mm, in hMG and CC+hMG cycles. For patients less than 35 years old, three or more implantations tripled when six or more follicles were ≥ 12 mm, in CC, hMG, and CC+hMG cycles, and when E(2) was ≥ 1000 pg mL in hMG and CC+hMG cycles. For patients 35 or older, pregnancy rates in hMG and CC+hMG cycles doubled when six or more follicles were ≥ 12 mm, or E(2) levels were > 1000 pg mL, whereas 3 or more implantations were not significantly increased.

Conclusions

Withholding hCG or IUI in CC, hMG, and CC+hMG cycles when six or more follicles are ≥ 12 mm may reduce triplet and higher-order implantations by 67% without significantly reducing pregnancy rates for patients under 35 years of age.

### Prediction of miscarriage in first trimester by serum estradiol, progesterone and β-human chorionic gonadotropin within 9 weeks of gestation [^2153450a]. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth (2022). Medium credibility.

Discussion

Our study showed that the serum estradiol, progesterone and HCG levels increased with gestational age during 5–9 weeks, which was consistent with previous results. In the miscarriage group, estradiol and progesterone were significantly decreased. Previous studies also showed that the levels of these indicators were decreased, indicating a poor pregnancy outcome. However, the value of these indicators in predicting miscarriage is still unclear.

Our results showed that the serum markers within 9 weeks of gestation can be used to differentiate the possibilities of normal pregnancy and miscarriage in first trimester. Specifically, low serum estradiol levels at 5–6 and 7–9 weeks and progesterone at 7–9 weeks can serve as the predictors, while β-HCG levels showed no prediction effect.

Our further dual or multi markers analysis showed that the AUC of estradiol combined with progesterone could reach the largest 0.871, and estradiol alone was 0.866. β-HCG did not increase the predictive efficacy of estradiol combined with progesterone or estradiol at 7–9 weeks for miscarriage. The reason could be that the predictive effect of estradiol was too great to be affected by β-HCG. The predictive effect of dual or multi markers at 5–6 weeks was lower than that at 7–9 weeks. β-HCG or progesterone level alone had no predictive significance, but their combination with estradiol could improve the predictive effect of estradiol at 5–6 weeks. Especially, dual of β-HCG and estradiol could perform better. So lower levels of estradiol are the primary predictor of miscarriage at 5 to 9 weeks. Our results are consistent with Yang Li, etc's report. The difference is that our study objective was to predict miscarriage within 12 weeks, while Yang Li, etc's was to exclude other adverse outcomes of normal pregnancy, such as biochemical ectopic pregnancy and miscarriage.

### The range and variation in serum estradiol concentration in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women treated with transdermal estradiol in a real-world setting: a cross-sectional study [^797cfd64]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

CONCLUSIONS

Our study provides novel insight into the range and interindividual variation in serum estradiol concentration in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women using transdermal estradiol in a real-world setting. Our data suggest that up to one in four women may need off-label doses to achieve therapeutic levels. Blood tests are not needed to diagnose menopause in women over the age of 45, because the diagnosis is clinical; and blood tests are not helpful to diagnose perimenopause, because estrogen levels fluctuate considerably. Blood tests cannot be used to inform dose decisions when levels are in the therapeutic range, because there is substantial intraindividual variation in serum estradiol concentration and clinical effect (pharmacodynamics). However, blood tests can be useful when the clinical response is suboptimal, especially in women using high licensed doses (4 PE), to determine whether a change in formulation or an off-label dose is likely to be of benefit. A blood test is also helpful when women with no or minimal menopausal symptoms want HT for bone protection, to confirm that levels are therapeutic (> 200 pmol/L).

Improved understanding of the substantial interindividual variation in estradiol pharmacokinetics facilitates dose customization based on clinical symptoms. Measurement of serum estradiol is useful to identify and guide dose customization in women who absorb transdermal estradiol poorly. Personalized care is key to prevent the immediate and long-term harms of estrogen deficiency.

Appendix C — adjunctive testing: serum estradiol (E2) "should be measured in a patient with baseline gynecomastia or breast symptoms", and for men developing such symptoms on testosterone therapy, "measuring a E2 level is optional". If baseline E2 is persistently elevated "(> 40 pg/mL)… referral to an endocrinologist should be made". For gynecomastia/breast symptoms developing during therapy, "a period of monitoring should be considered", and if symptoms persist with elevated E2, "reduction may be accomplished through dose adjustment of the testosterone therapy if the on-treatment testosterone levels are in the upper range of normal", whereas if on-treatment testosterone levels are "low/normal, E2 level reduction can be accomplished by the use of AIs".

Estradiol concentration: low and high levels

Low (subtherapeutic) estradiol levels were defined clinically as < 200 pmol/L. - In the whole cohort (N = 1,508), 378 women (25.07%) had low levels. Two hundred ninety-six of 933 women (31.73%) using licensed doses (1–4 PE) had estradiol levels of < 200 pmol/L, including 116 of 467 women (24.84%) using the highest licensed dose (4 PE), compared with 82 of 562 women (14.59%) using off-label doses (Fig. 3, Supplemental Table 7).

FIG. 3
The percentage of women with low estradiol levels (< 200 pmol/L) in each dose category. Dose (number of pump equivalents, PE) was treated as a categorical variable. The number of women with low or subtherapeutic levels (< 200 pmol/L) decreases as the dose increases, but up to 1 in four women using the maximum licensed dose (4 PE) have low levels, and around 1 in 6 women using high off-label doses (5–8 PE) have low levels.

### Value of the serum estradiol level for preventing ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome: a retrospective case control study [^ff5d9776]. Fertility and Sterility (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To assess the value of different serum E(2) cut-off levels for predicting women at risk for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS).

Design

Retrospective case-control study of a cohort of women undergoing assisted reproduction treatment (ART) over 12 months.

Setting

Tertiary university hospital.

Patient(S)

The study group included women with OHSS who fulfilled the endocrine inclusion criteria (n = 40). The control group was a random sample (n = 40) from the cohort of women undergoing ART.

Intervention(S)

None.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of different serum E(2) cut-off levels on day 11 of ovarian stimulation in preventing the establishment of OHSS.

Result(S)

Three hundred ninety-nine cycles (IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection) were undertaken between June 2000 and May 2001. The study group (n = 40) was compared with the control group (n = 40) undergoing ART during the same period of time. On day 8 of ovarian stimulation, the mean (SD) E(2) level in the study group was 8,517(5.3) pmol/L (2,320 pg/mL), and in the control group it was 2,540 (2.6) pmol/L (691 pg/mL). On day 11 of stimulation the mean (SD) E(2) level was 15,662 (4.2) pmol/L (4,266 pg/mL) and 5,804 (4.5) pmol/L (1,581 pg/mL), respectively. Twenty-four (60%) women who developed OHSS had E(2)levels > 6,000 pmol/L (1,634 pg/mL) on day 8 and above 11,000 pmol/L (2,996 pg/mL) on day 11. Sixteen (40%) had E(2) levels < 6,000 pmol/L (1,634 pg/mL) on day 8, but all had levels above 11,000 pmol/l (2,996 pg/mL) on day 11.

Conclusion(S)

A serum E(2) level of 12,315 pmol/L (3,354 pg/mL) on day 11 of ovarian stimulation gives a sensitivity and specificity of 85% for the detection of women at risk for OHSS.

### Association of vaginal estradiol tablet with serum estrogen levels in women who are postmenopausal: secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^92104587]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Limitations

This study has limitations. One of the primary limitations of our study and similar studies is the lack of a clear cutoff threshold for what concentration of circulating estradiol defines an increased risk for adverse outcomes. Our analysis used the cutoff of 2.7 pg/mL, which is based on a single study from 2002. Assays have changed dramatically since the publication of that study, and interpretation of all findings should take into account the newer ultrasensitive assays used in our studies. For these reasons, it is unlikely that this cutoff point is an appropriate marker for clinical risk with modern assays. Our study participants were part of a randomized clinical trial, which mitigates the impact of unmeasured confounders, but we did not have sufficient prevalence to assess potential confounders, such as alcohol use or smoking.

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^50c48afa]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Tailoring menopausal hormone therapy — shared decision-making, dosing, and monitoring are specified as follows: "We suggest a shared decision-making approach to decide about the choice of formulation, starting dose, the route of administration of MHT, and how to tailor MHT to each woman's individual situation, risks, and treatment goals". Clinicians prescribe estrogen alone for women without a uterus, use "the lowest effective dose with upward titration based on clinical response", and "usually do not measure estradiol levels to monitor therapy except when symptoms do not improve with escalating doses, particularly after changing the mode of administration from oral to transdermal". For younger women with surgical menopause or those with POI, higher starting doses may be used, for example "transdermal estradiol, 100 μg", then tapered as tolerated, and "the reassessment and tapering of MHT dose seems reasonable" as premature menopause approaches the natural menopause age.

### Systemic estradiol levels with low-dose vaginal estrogens [^f0ba56f6]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

In serum from postmenopausal women that was used for validating estradiol assays utilizing GC or LC with MS, mean or median levels of estradiol ranged from < 0.5 to 3.6 pg/mL in five of the seven studies shown in Fig. 1. - In the two remaining studies (Fig. 1), estradiol levels were double or more of the five studies (6.0 and 8.6 pg/mL). One other study only reported a range of estradiol (8–14 pg/mL) in postmenopausal women, also slightly higher than the above five studies. The higher concentrations in these three latter studies cannot be explained by lower sensitivity since the limits of detection and/or quantification were 0.1 to 1 pg/mL. - Demographic details of the postmenopausal women for which serum samples were measured were not reported for most of these validation studies, so any reason for the difference in the estradiol concentrations of the three studies reporting higher estradiol concentrations cannot be determined. Thus, mean estradiol levels from these studies were not included in the above calculation for untreated postmenopausal women.

Distribution of Combined Estradiol and FSH levels over Time.

Figure 3 shows the mean FSH levels respectively over time by treatment group (a), chemotherapy regimen (b), HR status/ET use (c), age group (d), and BMI (e). Treatment groups did not differ over time. Overall, chemotherapy regimen did not reach statistical significance (P = 0.08); however, the plot shows a qualitative interaction over time (P < 0.0001). HR status/ET use (defined as ever used in 24 months) was statistically significant and varied over time (P < 0.0001) with the tamoxifen group having the lowest FSH levels at 12 and 24 months. As expected, there was a difference in age with younger women having lower FSH levels. BMI was also statistically significant, and the magnitude of the difference varied over time (P < 0.0001). Obese women consistently had lower FSH levels than those with normal BMIs. Underweight women had higher FSH levels early on, but lower levels by 24 months. However, it should be noted that due to the low number of women in the underweight category, these estimates are inconclusive.

Fig. 3
Mean Follicle-stimulating Hormone (FSH) Levels Respectively over Time in NSABP B-47. Levels are presented by: treatment group (a), chemotherapy regimen (b), HR status/endocrine therapy use (c), age group (d), and BMI (e). A higher FSH level indicates a late premenopausal/postmenopausal range. Adjusted least-square means for time points 3 months and beyond were obtained from a mixed model for repeated measures analysis of the FSH level. The model includes age, FSH baseline level, the variable of interest, time, and variable-by-time interaction.

Persistent amenorrhea

An estimate of persistent amenorrhea was also of interest. Supplementary Table 4 shows the distribution of amenorrhea status at 24 and 36 months among those amenorrheic at 12 months. Among those amenorrheic at 12 months, 79.0% remained amenorrheic at 24 months, and 70.0% remained amenorrheic at 36 months. Persistent amenorrhea in relation to postmenopausal levels of FSH and estradiol are also presented. Among those who were amenorrheic at 12 months with high FSH and low estradiol at 12 months, 84.1% and 74.8% remained amenorrheic at 24 and 36 months, respectively.

### Compounded bioidentical menopausal hormone therapy: ACOG clinical consensus no. 6 [^4bee16ee]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Compounded bioidentical menopausal hormone therapy — adjunct hormone tests and dosing guidance: Data on the interpretation of adjunct hormone tests for prescribing and dosing compounded bioidentical menopausal hormone therapy are limited; thus, these tests are not recommended for these indications. As steroid hormones, estrogen and progesterone do not require individualized testing, and currently, there are no FDA-approved salivary or urinary tests for steroid hormone measurement. Most individuals do not require additional ancillary testing of serum levels, and dosing should be titrated to patient-reported menopausal symptom relief; however, if a patient presents already having started compounded bioidentical menopausal hormone therapy, the clinician may consider serum level testing to aid in adequate titration. Generally, a target estradiol level of 40–100 pg/mL is a reasonable range to provide relief from symptoms. Because compounded bioidentical menopausal hormone therapy products are not tested for efficacy and safety by the FDA, the potency of these formulations may be too high or low, and the pharmacokinetics may be inconsistent.

### ACOG practice bulletin no. 141: management of menopausal symptoms [^05f82117]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2014). Medium credibility.

ACOG Practice Bulletin — estrogen for menopausal vaginal symptoms: Estrogen therapy effectively alleviates atrophic vaginal symptoms related to menopause, and local therapy is advised for women with only vaginal symptoms; all low-dose systemic estrogen formulations are FDA-approved for atrophic vaginitis. Oral conjugated equine estrogen as low as 0.3 mg/d and transdermal estradiol 12.5 micrograms/d have demonstrated improvements in vaginal atrophy. Local vaginal estradiol or conjugated equine estrogen in cream, ring, and tablet forms are effective, with randomized controlled trials (RCTs) showing that even low-dose (10 micrograms) vaginal estradiol tablets improve symptoms. Typical use is daily for 1–2 weeks as induction therapy followed by indefinite low-dose maintenance, and the 3-month estradiol-releasing vaginal ring is preferred to cream because of greater comfort, ease of use, and satisfaction. Systemic absorption has been documented with 25 micrograms of estradiol, but a Cochrane meta-analysis of 19 trials with 4,162 women found no increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia versus placebo; thus, progestin for endometrial protection is not needed, and use of progestin or local estrogen therapy does not require endometrial surveillance unless women experience postmenopausal bleeding, which would require diagnostic evaluation.

### How is age at menopause and reproductive lifespan associated with chronic pain outcomes in postmenopausal women? [^f06f89f2]. Pain (2025). Medium credibility.

Validity of lifetime estradiol exposure hypothesis can be challenged by recent in vivo multimodality imaging study findings showing a gradual increase in estrogen receptor density in the brain during the menopause transition, accompanied by changes in brain volume, perfusion, and energy metabolism. Significant overlap with estrogen-regulated brain networks linked to reproductive and higher-order cognitive functions was observed, independent of chronological age and plasma estradiol levels. This suggests a novel connection between female endocrine aging and heightened expression of estrogen receptors in brain regions associated with cognitive functions, spanning mood, memory, stress, pain, and fine motor skills. Also supporting the concept of estrogenic and biochemical adjustments during perimenopause and early postmenopausal phases that are linked to health issues.

Sex hormones vary throughout the lifespan and most important shifts depend on reproductive stage known as reproductive ageing. Although age correlated with reproductive age, the actual developmental stage cannot be determined solely based on chronological age. At puberty, girls typically experience menarche between ages 9 and 18 years; this stage is characterised by elevated levels of estradiol and profound changes in the brain and body from childhood to puberty, (please see earlier reviews). Menopause marks the end of fertility and is linked to a decrease in estradiol levels, with estrone becoming the dominant form of estrogen in postmenopausal women. These reproductive stages are critical periods defined by major hormonal changes, acting as important proxy measures primarily reflecting fluctuations in estradiol levels.

### TX-004HR vaginal estradiol has negligible to very low systemic absorption of estradiol [^233b6237]. Menopause (2017). Low credibility.

Low-dose vaginal estrogen is a safe and effective treatment for symptoms associated with vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA), such as vaginal dryness, irritation, and pain with intercourse, which occur as a result of declining estrogen associated with menopause. The rationale for using a vaginal delivery system includes the ability to provide low doses of estrogen with local administration to eliminate or minimize levels of circulating estrogens, and bypass hepatic circulation, thus reducing potential side effects.

The Working Group on Women's Health and Well-Being in Menopause petitioned the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to modify the labeling of low-dose vaginal estrogens, which do not significantly increase systemic levels of estradiol. The US FDA held a workshop on November 10, 2015, in which they invited a panel of scientific experts to discuss the topic of product labeling for local estrogen therapies. Some concerns remain regarding elevations in circulating estrogen concentrations with some vaginal products, despite the well-characterized and positive benefit/risk ratio of low-dose vaginal estrogen products.

TX-004HR (TherapeuticsMD, Inc. Boca Raton, FL) is a new 17β-estradiol vaginal product developed to rapidly and effectively treat menopausal VVA signs and symptoms with no systemic exposure. Its novel design does not require an applicator, intended to make it easy to use and increase user acceptability and overall satisfaction.

Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (PK) studies have shown that women using 10 or 25-μg doses of TX-004HR have very low levels of serum estradiol after administration, which were within the postmenopausal range. Furthermore, these same women had estrogen levels that were approximately 30% of the serum estrogen concentrations observed in women who received identical doses of an approved vaginal estradiol tablet after 24 hours.

The REJOICE trial demonstrated that TX-004HR (4, 10, and 25 μg) was safe, well-tolerated, and effective for treating symptomatic VVA. Women who were treated with any TX-004HR dose had significant improvements in percentages of vaginal superficial and parabasal cells, vaginal pH, and severity of dyspareunia as early as 2 weeks, and vaginal dryness as early as 6 weeks, relative to women treated with placebo, with improvements continuing to 12 weeks.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile after the daily vaginal administration of 3 doses of TX-004HR (4, 10, and 25 μg) for 2 weeks and then at day 84 to assess systemic exposure of estradiol and its metabolites.

### Systemic estradiol levels with low-dose vaginal estrogens [^b1521328]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Abstract

Objectives:

To critically evaluate published systemic estradiol levels during use of low-dose vaginal estrogens considering detection method and estrogen dose; describe challenges with accurately measuring estradiol; and determine the normal estradiol level range in postmenopausal women.

Methods:

PubMed was searched for studies reporting systemic estradiol levels with lower-dose vaginal estrogens (≤ 25 μg estradiol or 0.3 mg conjugated equine estrogens). Estradiol levels at baseline and during treatment, area under the curve, and maximum estradiol concentrations were summarized by dose within assay type. A proposed range of systemic estradiol in normal, untreated, postmenopausal women was estimated by conservatively pooling means and standard deviations from published studies.

Results:

Mean basal estradiol levels were 3.1 to 4.9 pg/mL using liquid or gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (LC or GC/MS/MS) with a range of undetectable to 10.5 pg/mL using radioimmunoassay. Systemic estradiol levels with vaginal estrogens reflected their doses as measured with LC or GC/MS/MS in different studies: 7.1 to 9.1 pg/mL and 16.7 to 22.7 pg/mL with a 25-μg softgel capsule insert and a tablet insert, respectively; 4.6 to 7.4 pg/mL and 6.6 to 14.8 pg/mL with a 10-μg softgel capsule and a tablet insert, respectively; and 3.6 to 3.9 pg/mL with a 4-μg softgel capsule insert. A mean systemic estradiol concentration ranging from undetectable to 10.7 pg/mL is proposed as an estimate for basal estradiol levels in normal, untreated, postmenopausal women. Systemic estradiol absorption may be influenced by the placement of estradiol higher (as with an applicator) versus lower (as without an applicator) in the vagina, as estradiol transport to the uterus would be more likely further away than closer to the introitus.

Conclusion:

Serum estradiol concentrations were generally lower when measured with more specific and sensitive assays. Estradiol absorption was dose-dependent, and may be influenced by dose, formulation, and positioning in the vagina. Very low systemic estradiol absorption with low/ultralow-dose vaginal estrogens may potentially decrease any adverse events that may be associated with higher doses of vaginal estrogens used for treating moderate to severe VVA due to less estradiol exposure.

### Estradiol gel 0.1% (estradiol) [^e0597041]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

PATIENT INFORMATION

Estradiol gel 0.1%

Read this Patient Information leaflet before you start using estradiol gel 0.1% and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your menopausal symptoms or your treatment.

What is estradiol gel 0.1%?

Estradiol gel 0.1% is a prescription medicine that contains estradiol (an estrogen hormone). Estradiol gel 0.1% is a clear, colorless, smooth gel that is odorless when dry. When applied to the skin, estradiol is absorbed through the skin into the bloodstream.

What is estradiol gel 0.1% used for?

Estradiol gel 0.1% is used after menopause to:

Reduce moderate to severe hot flashes

Estrogens are hormones made by a woman's ovaries. The ovaries normally stop making estrogens when a woman is between 45 to 55 years old. This drop in body estrogen levels causes the "change of life" or menopause (the end of monthly menstrual periods). Sometimes, both ovaries are removed during an operation before natural menopause takes place. The sudden drop in estrogen levels causes "surgical menopause".

When the estrogen levels begin dropping, some women develop very uncomfortable symptoms, such as feelings of warmth in the face, neck, and chest, or sudden intense feelings of heat and sweating ("hot flashes" or "hot flushes"). In some women, the symptoms are mild, and they will not need estrogens. In other women, symptoms can be more severe.

### Estradiol absorption from vaginal tablets in postmenopausal women [^91e1735d]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To evaluate absorption of estradiol (E2) and compare two low doses of 17 beta-E2 (25 microgram and 10 microgram) in postmenopausal women with atrophic vaginitis.

Methods

In a double-masked, randomized, parallel-group study, 58 postmenopausal women were treated with 25 microgram or 10 microgram of 17 beta-E2 for 12 weeks. We report data for 42 eligible subjects who had serum E2 concentrations below 20 pg/mL at baseline and complete data available at the baseline visit (30 minutes before tablet insertion) and weeks 2 and 12. Serum E2 and FSH concentrations were measured at specified intervals. The area under the curve, maximal concentration, and time to maximal concentration were measured for serum E2 concentrations. Maturation values of vaginal epithelial cells were assessed as indicators of change in vaginal epithelium condition in response to treatment.

Results

After 12 weeks of treatment, the area under the curve, maximal and average over 24-hour E2 concentration were higher in the 25-microgram (563 pg. hour/mL, 49 and 23 pg/mL) than in the 10-microgram (264 pg. hour/mL, 22 and 11 pg/mL) group. Seventy-four percent in the 25-microgram and 96% in the 10-microgram groups had low systemic absorption of E2, that is, area under the curve (0–24 hour) less than 500 pg/mL. All but three women who received 25 microgram had mean FSH levels below 35 mIU/mL.

Conclusion

Treatment with 25 or 10 microgram of 17 beta-E2 vaginal tablets resulted in low absorption of estrogen without systemic effects often associated with hormone replacement therapy. After 12 weeks of therapy for atrophic vaginitis, absorption patterns remained consistent, and women did not have accumulations of circulating E2.

### Caution: vaginal estradiol appears to be contraindicated in postmenopausal women on adjuvant aromatase inhibitors [^90bdfed2]. Annals of Oncology (2006). Low credibility.

Background

Aromatase inhibitors (AI) are increasingly used in early breast cancer and there is a growing interest in associated long-term side-effects of profound estrogen suppression. Urogenital side-effects due to atrophic vaginitis are often managed with vaginal estrogen preparations. These are generally perceived to result in minimal systemic absorption of estrogen. We followed serum estradiol, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH) levels in seven postmenopausal women using vaginal estrogen preparations whilst on AIs for breast cancer.

Patients and Methods

Serum was analysed for estradiol, FSH and LH at baseline then 2, 4, 7–10 and 12 weeks since commencement of vaginal estradiol. Estradiol was measured on an assay specifically developed for measuring low levels in postmenopausal women.

Results

Serum estradiol levels rose from baseline levels ≤ 5 pmol/l consistent with AI therapy to a mean 72 pmol/l at 2 weeks. By 4 weeks this had decreased to < 35 pmol/l in the majority (median 16 pmol/l) although significant further rises were seen in two women.

Conclusions

The vaginal estradiol tablet Vagifem significantly raises systemic estradiol levels, at least in the short term. This reverses the estradiol suppression achieved by aromatase inhibitors in women with breast cancer and is contraindicated.

Estradiol Valerate Injection is used after menopause to:

reduce moderate to severe hot flashes. Estrogens are hormones made by a woman's ovaries. The ovaries normally stop making estrogens when a woman is between 45 to 55 years old. This drop in body estrogen levels causes the "change of life" or menopause (the end of monthly menstrual periods). Sometimes, both ovaries are removed during an operation before natural menopause takes place. The sudden drop in estrogen levels causes "surgical menopause".

When the estrogen levels begin dropping, some women develop very uncomfortable symptoms, such as feeling of warmth in the face, neck, and chest, or sudden strong feelings of heat and sweating ("hot flashes" or "hot flushes"). In some women, the symptoms are mild, and they will not need estrogens. In other women, symptoms can be more severe. You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with Estradiol Valerate Injection.

### Estradiol (estradiol transdermal system) [^f79fa907]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Dose proportionality was also demonstrated for the Estradiol Transdermal System (12.5 cm2and 25 cm2) in a 1-week study conducted in 54 postmenopausal women. The mean steady state levels (Cavg) of the estradiol during the application of the Estradiol Transdermal System 25 cm2and 12.5 cm2on the abdomen were about 80 and 40 pg/mL, respectively.

In a 3-week multiple application study in 24 postmenopausal women, the 25 cm2Estradiol Transdermal System produced average peak estradiol concentrations (Cmax) of approximately 100 pg/mL. Trough values at the end of each wear interval (Cmin) were approximately 35 pg/mL. Nearly identical serum curves were seen each week, indicating little or no accumulation of estradiol in the body. Serum estrone peak and trough levels were 60 and 40 pg/mL, respectively.

In a single dose, randomized, crossover study conducted to compare the effect of site of application, 38 postmenopausal women wore a single Estradiol Transdermal System 25 cm2transdermal system for 1 week on the abdomen and buttocks. The estradiol serum concentration profiles are shown in Figure 2. Values of Cmaxand Cavgwere, respectively, 25 percent and 17 percent higher with the buttock application than with the abdomen application.

Table 2 provides a summary of estradiol pharmacokinetic parameters determined during evaluation of the Estradiol Transdermal System transdermal system.

The relative standard deviation of each pharmacokinetic parameter after application to the abdomen averaged 50 percent, which is indicative of the considerable intersubject variability associated with transdermal drug delivery. The relative standard deviation of each pharmacokinetic parameter after application to the buttock was lower than that after application to the abdomen (for example, for Cmax39 percent versus 62 percent, and for Cavg35 percent versus 48 percent).

Distribution

The distribution of exogenous estrogens is similar to that of endogenous estrogens. Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs. Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to SHBG and albumin.

### Systemic estradiol levels with low-dose vaginal estrogens [^e0e0106e]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

Objectives

To critically evaluate published systemic estradiol levels during use of low-dose vaginal estrogens considering detection method and estrogen dose; describe challenges with accurately measuring estradiol; and determine the normal estradiol level range in postmenopausal women.

Methods

PubMed was searched for studies reporting systemic estradiol levels with lower-dose vaginal estrogens (≤ 25μg estradiol or 0.3mg conjugated equine estrogens). Estradiol levels at baseline and during treatment, area under the curve, and maximum estradiol concentrations were summarized by dose within assay type. A proposed range of systemic estradiol in normal, untreated, postmenopausal women was estimated by conservatively pooling means and standard deviations from published studies.

Results

Mean basal estradiol levels were 3.1 to 4.9pg/mL using liquid or gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (LC or GC/MS/MS) with a range of undetectable to 10.5pg/mL using radioimmunoassay. Systemic estradiol levels with vaginal estrogens reflected their doses as measured with LC or GC/MS/MS in different studies: 7.1 to 9.1pg/mL and 16.7 to 22.7pg/mL with a 25-μg softgel capsule insert and a tablet insert, respectively; 4.6 to 7.4pg/mL and 6.6 to 14.8pg/mL with a 10-μg softgel capsule and a tablet insert, respectively; and 3.6 to 3.9pg/mL with a 4-μg softgel capsule insert. A mean systemic estradiol concentration ranging from undetectable to 10.7pg/mL is proposed as an estimate for basal estradiol levels in normal, untreated, postmenopausal women. Systemic estradiol absorption may be influenced by the placement of estradiol higher (as with an applicator) versus lower (as without an applicator) in the vagina, as estradiol transport to the uterus would be more likely further away than closer to the introitus.

Conclusion

Serum estradiol concentrations were generally lower when measured with more specific and sensitive assays. Estradiol absorption was dose-dependent, and may be influenced by dose, formulation, and positioning in the vagina. Very low systemic estradiol absorption with low/ultralow-dose vaginal estrogens may potentially decrease any adverse events that may be associated with higher doses of vaginal estrogens used for treating moderate to severe VVA due to less estradiol exposure.

### NCCN guidelines® insights: breast cancer, version 5.2025 [^5d42f559]. Journal of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (2025). High credibility.

Adjuvant endocrine therapy — premenopausal patients and menopausal assessment: If premenopausal at diagnosis, the NCCN Panel recommended 5 years of tamoxifen alone (category 1) or tamoxifen with OFS (category 1) or OFS plus AI for 5 years (category 1). Patients premenopausal at diagnosis who become amenorrheic with chemotherapy may have continued estrogen production from the ovaries without menses, and menopausal status cannot be determined while receiving OFS. Because AIs can stimulate ovarian function, to assure a true postmenopausal status, serial assessment of circulating LH, FSH, and estradiol is mandatory when considering this subset for AI therapy; frequency of testing of estradiol and FSH/LH levels should be individualized.

Vaginal delivery of systemic estrogens — "Estradiol acetate vaginal rings, delivering 50 or 100 μg of estradiol daily (Table 5), provide consistent systemic estradiol levels for 3 months per ring insertion". "They are indicated for treatment of moderate to severe VMS and VVA due to menopause". High-dose vaginal creams "contain estradiol or CEE (ie, 1–2 g) also result in systemic estrogen levels", and "Concomitant progestogen is needed with these preparations to abrogate endometrial stimulation".

### Treatment of symptoms of the menopause: an endocrine society clinical practice guideline [^0937dde1]. The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism (2015). Medium credibility.

Regarding screening and diagnosis for menopause, more specifically with respect to diagnostic criteria, ES 2015 guidelines recommend to consider making a presumptive diagnosis of menopause based on the presence of vasomotor symptoms and, when indicated, laboratory testing (FSH and serum estradiol), if establishing a diagnosis of menopause is necessary in females having undergone a hysterectomy without bilateral oophorectomy or presenting with a menstrual history inadequate to ascertain menopausal status.

### Factors associated with serum estradiol levels among postmenopausal women using hormone therapy [^453a87ef]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2020). Medium credibility.

Objective

To identify factors associated with serum estradiol (E2) levels among healthy postmenopausal women using hormone therapy (HT).

Methods

This is an unplanned post hoc analysis of data from ELITE (Early versus Late Intervention Trial with Estradiol), a randomized controlled trial of 1 mg oral E2 with or without vaginal progesterone in healthy early compared with late (< 6 years compared with 10 or more years since menopause) postmenopausal women. We included results from visits when women reported at least 80% compliance with HT. Mixed-effects linear models identified factors associated with serum E2 levels while participants were taking HT, assessed every 6 months over a median follow-up of 4.8 years and adjusted for baseline E2 level, visit, and reduced E2 dose. Possible correlates evaluated included demographics, clinical characteristics, medication use, and biomarkers of liver and kidney metabolic function.

Results

The analysis included 2,160 E2 measurements in 275 postmenopausal women. Mean ± SD age was 55.4 ± 3.9 vs 64.4 ± 5.5 years, and mean ± SD time since menopause was 3.6 ± 1.8 vs 16.0 ± 5.6 years for early vs late postmenopausal women. Adjusted for pretreatment E2 level, visit, and reduced dose indicator, higher serum E2 levels were associated with higher body mass index (BMI), higher weight, surgical menopause, alcohol use, and antihypertensive medication use. Current and past smoking and antifungal medication use were associated with lower serum E2 levels. In the multivariable model, higher BMI and alcohol use were associated with higher serum E2 levels, whereas current and past smoking were associated with lower serum E2 levels. These factors were similar between early and late postmenopausal women.

Conclusion

Factors associated with serum E2 levels among postmenopausal women taking HT include BMI, alcohol use, and smoking. As serum E2 levels relate to HT effect, achievement of desirable E2 levels may be maximized through personalized intervention.

### Impact of topical interventions on the vaginal microbiota and metabolome in postmenopausal women: a secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial [^a25ebded]. JAMA Network Open (2022). High credibility.

Introduction

In the Menopause Strategies–Finding Lasting Answers for Symptoms and Health (MsFLASH) trial network's Vaginal Health Trial of treatment for moderate to severe vaginal symptoms of menopause, no significant difference in symptom reduction was seen between estradiol vaginal tablet or vaginal moisturizer and placebo: all 3 groups had similar improvement. While both hormonal and nonhormonal treatments have been shown to improve postmenopausal vaginal symptoms, the lack of difference between estradiol and placebo was surprising. The placebo gel used in the trial had high lubricity and low pH, while the moisturizer also had low pH; both properties may contribute to decreased symptoms via biological effects that differ from estradiol. Some interpreted these findings as a statement that estrogen treatment was ineffective, rather than a recognition that different types of interventions may reduce postmenopausal vaginal discomfort.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance for outcome measures in clinical trials of treatment for moderate to severe genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) recommends 3 coprimary end points: change in most bothersome symptom (MBS) severity, pH, and vaginal maturation index (VMI). In our primary analysis, more participants in the estrogen group had pH less than 5 and more than 5% superficial cells on VMI than placebo at 12 weeks, although the placebo gel was acidic. The regulatory guidance weights these changes in the vaginal mucosal environment equally with improvement in MBS, but it is unclear whether these mucosal changes reflect any additional benefits to genitourinary health beyond symptom improvement.

We conducted a subset post hoc analysis of participants from the MsFLASH Vaginal Health Trial to evaluate the effect of topical interventions for GSM on the microbiota and metabolome, and to assess whether larger changes in pH and VMI in the estradiol group reflect other changes in the vaginal microbiota and metabolome that might impact genitourinary health.

### Contraception in perimenopause [^6043eee9]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

Perimenopause is characterized by wide hormone fluctuations and irregular menstrual cycles for 5 or more years preceding menopause and lasts until 12 months of amenorrhea have been achieved. It represents a period of reproductive transition with a decline in fertility. However, unintended pregnancies do occur, with a high risk for poor outcomes and maternal complications. All women transitioning through perimenopause should be adequately counseled. There are many hormone and nonhormone contraceptive methods that are highly effective and suited to the personal and medical needs of the perimenopausal woman. Contraception should continue until menopause is confirmed.

Patient Information

Estradiol/Norethindrone Acetate Tablets, for oral use

Read this Patient Information before you start using Estradiol/Norethindrone Acetate Tablets and each time you get a refill. There may be new information. This information does not take the place of talking to your healthcare provider about your menopausal symptoms or your treatment.

What is Estradiol/Norethindrone Acetate Tablets?

Estradiol/Norethindrone Acetate Tablets are a prescription medicine that contains two kinds of hormones, an estrogen and a progestogen.

What is Estradiol/Norethindrone Acetate Tablets used for?

Estradiol/Norethindrone Acetate Tablets are used after menopause to:

Reduce moderate to severe hot flushes

Estrogens are hormones made by a woman's ovaries. The ovaries normally stop making estrogens when a woman is between 45 and 55 yrs old. This drop in body estrogen levels causes the "change of life" or menopause, the end of monthly menstrual periods. Sometimes both ovaries are removed during an operation before natural menopause takes place. The sudden drop in estrogen levels causes "surgical menopause".

When estrogen levels begin dropping, some women get very uncomfortable symptoms, such as feelings of warmth in the face, neck, and chest, or sudden, intense feelings of heat and sweating ("hot flashes" or "hot flushes"). In some women, the symptoms are mild, and they will not need to use estrogens. In other women, symptoms can be more severe.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the care of girls and women with Turner syndrome [^fd217a5d]. Pediatrics (2017). Medium credibility.

Turner syndrome — estradiol (E2) initiation and dose escalation for pubertal induction are specified as follows: For girls who do not enter spontaneous puberty, as determined by elevated FSH on multiple checks between 8 and 12 years old, plan low dose E2 initiation between 11 and 12 years old. We recommend a starting dose of 7 mcg TD E2 or 0.25 mg oral E2, and increasing the dosing every 6–12 months. Breast stage and serum E2 concentrations can guide progression of dosing escalation to reach adult dosing by year 4 of treatment, with serum E2 concentrations close to 367–550 pmol L−1 (100–150 pg mL−1). For girls who have spontaneous puberty and then develop ovarian insufficiency, E2 dosing should be parallel to their pubertal stage; for example, a girl who has reached breast stage 3 (or mid-puberty) can start treatment at 25 mcg TD E2 or 1 mg oral E2.

### Twelve-month estrogen levels in premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer receiving adjuvant triptorelin plus exemestane or tamoxifen in the suppression of ovarian function trial (SOFT): the SOFT-EST substudy [^13908e49]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2016). Low credibility.

Purpose

To describe estradiol (E2), estrone (E1), and estrone sulfate (E1S) levels during the first year of monthly triptorelin plus exemestane or tamoxifen and to assess possible suboptimal suppression while receiving exemestane plus triptorelin.

Patients and Methods

Premenopausal patients with early breast cancer on the Suppression of Ovarian Function Trial who selected triptorelin as the ovarian suppression method and were randomly assigned to exemestane plus triptorelin or tamoxifen plus triptorelin were enrolled until the target population of 120 patients was reached. Blood sampling time points were 0, 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months. Serum estrogens were measured with a highly sensitive and specific assay. This preplanned 12-month analysis evaluated E2, E1, E1S, follicle-stimulating hormone, and luteinizing hormone levels in all patients and the proportion of patients with E2 levels greater than 2.72 pg/mL at any time point during treatment with exemestane plus triptorelin.

Results

One hundred sixteen patients (exemestane, n = 86; tamoxifen, n = 30; median age, 44 years; median E2, 51 pg/mL; 55% prior chemotherapy) started triptorelin and had one or more samples drawn. With exemestane plus triptorelin, median reductions from baseline E2, E1, and E1S levels were consistently ≥ 95%, resulting in significantly lower levels than with tamoxifen plus triptorelin at all time points. Among patients on exemestane plus triptorelin, 25%, 24%, and 17% had an E2 level greater than 2.72 pg/mL at 3, 6, and 12 months, respectively. Baseline factors related to on-treatment E2 level greater than 2.72 pg/mL were no prior chemotherapy (P = 0.06), higher body mass index (P = 0.05), and lower follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone (each P < .01).

Conclusion

During the first year, most patients on exemestane plus triptorelin had E2 levels below the defined threshold of 2.72 pg/mL, consistent with levels reported in postmenopausal patients on aromatase inhibitors, but at each time point, at least 17% of patients had levels greater than the threshold.

### Estradiol (estring) [^97937319]. FDA (2025). Medium credibility.

ESTRING DRUG DELIVERY

Once in the vagina, ESTRING begins to release estradiol immediately. ESTRING will continue to release a low, continuous dose of estradiol for the full 90 days it remains in place.

It will take about 2 to 3 weeks to restore the tissue of the vagina and urinary tract to a healthier condition and to feel the full effect of ESTRING in relieving vaginal and urinary symptoms. If your symptoms persist for more than a few weeks after beginning ESTRING therapy, contact your doctor or healthcare provider.

One of the most frequently reported effects associated with the use of ESTRING is an increase in vaginal secretions. These secretions are like those that occur normally prior to menopause and indicate that ESTRING is working. However, if the secretions are associated with a bad odor or vaginal itching or discomfort, be sure to contact your doctor or healthcare provider.

ESTRING REMOVAL

After 90 days there will no longer be enough estradiol in the ring to maintain its full effect in relieving your vaginal or urinary symptoms. ESTRING should be removed at that time and replaced with a new ESTRING, if your doctor determines that you need to continue your therapy.

To remove ESTRING:

Wash and dry your hands thoroughly.
Assume a comfortable position, either standing with one leg up, squatting, or lying down.
Loop your finger through the ring and gently pull it out.
Discard the used ring in a waste receptacle. (Do not flush ESTRING.)

If you have any additional questions about removing ESTRING, contact your doctor or healthcare provider.

### A multicenter, randomized study to select the minimum effective dose of estetrol (E4) in postmenopausal women (E4Relief): part 1. vasomotor symptoms and overall safety [^ac3e397a]. Menopause (2020). Medium credibility.

For the sake of comparison, the Cochrane review of 24 randomized, placebo-controlled studies (3,329 participants in total) showed a reduction of frequency of VMS of 75.0% (95% CI, 64.3–82.3) for menopausal hormone therapy, and of 57.7% (95% CI, 45.1–67.7) for placebo. Our results of −82% for 15 mg E4 and −65% for placebo are both at the upper limit of the ranges in the Cochrane review, showing a high efficacy level of E4, at least comparable to those of the conjugated equine estrogens and E2 reported.

No clear explanation can be given for the observed large placebo effect in the present study, although this has also been described by others in trials using classic estrogens. The relatively high E2 levels at baseline and also at week 12 (Table 5) in the placebo group (mean ± SD 11.4 ± 16.5 pg/mL with min-max values of < 5 and 86 at baseline, and 11.6 ± 27.8 pg/mL with min-max values of < 5 and 180 at Week 12, respectively), were higher than the E2 levels recorded in the 15 mg E4 group (6.1 ± 2.4 pg/mL, min-max values of < 5–15 at baseline, and 5.7 ± 2.2 pg/mL, min-max values of < 5–19 pg/mL at week 12). This large difference in E2 levels observed between the placebo and the 15 mg E4 groups may have played a role (as observed in the post hoc analysis using E2 levels as a covariate), and suggests that some women may have been perimenopausal with some fluctuating, unpredictable increases in residual ovarian activity. Some women in this group may not have been compliant with the protocol and may have used other compounds. In addition, there is the issue of the subjective element inherent to self-scoring the frequency as well as the severity of HFs. To our knowledge, the present study is the first using an e-diary with, therefore, the risk of over-reporting of symptoms. Moreover, considerable variability in the placebo response may occur and is influenced by numerous nonspecific factors. These include a higher response rate in trials of hormonal versus nonhormonal drugs, severity of symptoms, anxiety, mood changes, treatment expectation both by clinician and patient, suggestibility, ethnicity, current smoking, or BMI more than 30. All these factors may contribute to a greater placebo response with a decrease in HF frequency more than 30% versus baseline, not only transiently, but also for a sustained period of time. Recently, in the 12-month VMS treatment study using E2/P4 oral capsules, the placebo effect was smaller than in our study, and approximately −55% for frequency and −22% for severity.

### Factors associated with endometrial bleeding in continuous hormone replacement therapy [^e4d34bd3]. Menopause (2002). Low credibility.

Objective

To identify clinical and laboratory parameters associated with the occurrence of endometrial bleeding within the first 6 months of treatment in postmenopausal women taking continuous hormone replacement therapy.

Design

We performed a prospective study of 55 postmenopausal women who had amenorrhea for at least 12 months before baseline screening and were taking 0.625 mg conjugated estrogen and 5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate daily on a continuous basis. Postmenopausal duration was defined as the interval, in months, between the last menstruation and the commencement of treatment. All subjects were instructed to monitor bleeding episodes in a diary and were followed up monthly for at least 12 months.

Results

Thirty-four women (62%) experienced bleeding within the first 6 months of treatment. Using a multivariate approach, a woman with a postmenopausal duration of 24 months or less had a relative risk of 8.2 (95% confidence limits: 1.3, 53.1) of bleeding, as compared with those with a postmenopausal duration of more than 24 months. Furthermore, pretreatment endometrial thickness greater than 5 mm (p < 0.05) and serum estradiol levels greater than 25 pg/mL (p < 0.01) were noted to be significantly correlated with the occurrence of bleeding in women with a postmenopausal duration of more than 24 months.

Conclusions

Women with a postmenopausal duration of 24 months or less, a pretreatment endometrial thickness greater than 5 mm, and serum estradiol level greater than 25 pg/mL are at risk to have endometrial bleeding within the first 6 months of continuous hormone replacement therapy.

What is the Estradiol Transdermal System?

the Estradiol Transdermal System is a prescription medicine patch (transdermal system) that contains estradiol (an estrogen hormone).

What is the Estradiol Transdermal System used for?

The Estradiol Transdermal System is used after menopause to:

Reduce moderate to severe hot flashes
Estrogens are hormones made by a woman's ovaries. The ovaries normally stop making estrogens when a woman is between 45 and 55 years old. This drop in body estrogen levels causes the "change of life" or menopause (the end of monthly menstrual periods).

In some women, the symptoms are mild, and they will not need to use estrogens. In other women, symptoms can be more severe.
Treat moderate to severe menopausal changes in and around the vagina
You and your healthcare provider should talk regularly about whether you still need treatment with the Estradiol Transdermal System to control these problems. If you use the Estradiol Transdermal System only to treat your menopausal changes in and around your vagina, talk with your healthcare provider about whether a topical vaginal product would be better for you.
Treat certain conditions in women before menopause if their ovaries do not produce enough estrogens naturally
Help reduce your chances of getting osteoporosis (thin weak bones)
Osteoporosis from menopause is a thinning of the bones that makes them weaker and easier to break. If you use the Estradiol Transdermal System only to prevent osteoporosis due to menopause, talk with your healthcare provider about whether a different treatment or medicine without estrogens might be better for you.

### Premenopausal endogenous oestrogen levels and breast cancer risk: a meta-analysis [^1979d4f8]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

We assumed in our analysis that a log-normal distribution for E2 is reasonable. In three of the studies it is explicitly stated that E2 was log-normally distributed. In addition, the 12.5th and 87.5th percentiles of E2, reported bystudy, are equidistant from their reported median, after log transformation, which means that log transformation removes the positive skew observed in their data. Similarly, the 25th and 75th percentiles of the residuals of E2 in controls from the spline regression carried out by) are equidistant from their median after log transformation. It seems therefore that a log-normal assumption is reasonable.

It is possible that the effect of a doubling of E2 on breast cancer risk differs according to the phase of the menstrual cycle. This, coupled with the fact that different methods were used to match or adjust for time of blood sample collection in the menstrual cycle in the various studies, may limit the utility of a single pooled estimate. However, a number of factors suggest that our pooled estimate may well be generalisable to the different phases of the cycle. First, we did not find any statistically significant evidence of heterogeneity in the magnitude of associations across studies. Second, although one study did report weak evidence of an association in the follicular phase, but not in the luteal phase, confidence intervals on the magnitude of the associations in the two phases were wide and they did not report the result of a statistical interaction test for a difference between these. Third, in a previous study we took repeated measurements of urinary oestrone glucuronide, a principal metabolite of serum oestrogens that is highly correlated with serum E2, in premenopausal women, and estimated the association at different times in the menstrual cycle with mammographic density, a very strong marker of breast cancer risk. We found that the mean level of oestrone glucuronide throughout the cycle is the most biologically relevant measure associated with mammographic density, rather than that in any particular phase in the cycle. This provides us with some evidence that our pooled results are not materially affected by the different ways in which time in the menstrual cycle was accounted for.

### Midluteal serum estradiol levels are associated with live birth rates in hormone replacement therapy frozen embryo transfer cycles: a cohort study [^3bcd9e34]. Fertility and Sterility (2024). Medium credibility.

Objective

To study whether midluteal serum estradiol (E2) levels are associated with the live birth rate in hormone replacement therapy frozen embryo transfer (HRT-FET) cycles in patients with optimal midluteal serum progesterone (P4) levels.

Design

Observational prospective cohort study.

Setting

Public fertility clinic.

Patients

A total of 412 women had an HRT-FET cycle single blastocyst transfer from January 2020 to November 2022.

Intervention

The HRT-FET cycle priming regimen included oral E2 (6mg/24 h) administered in the evening, followed by vaginal P4 (400mg/12 h). Serum E2 and P4 levels were measured using a standardized method, 2–4 hours after the latest P4 administration and 9–14 hours after E4 administration on the day of blastocyst transfer, day 6 of P4 administration. Patients with serum P4 levels (< 11 ng/mL [35 nmol/L]) on the day of transfer received additional rectal P4 (400mg/12 h). No additional E2 dose was administered.

Main Outcome Measures

The primary outcome was the live birth rate (LBR) in relation to E2 levels at blastocyst transfer day.

Results

The optimal serum E2 levels correlating with ongoing pregnancy were ≥ 292 pg/mL and < 409 pg/mL (≥ 1,070 pmol/L and < 1,500 pmol/L). The LBR was 59% (60/102) when E2 levels were within this range, whereas a significantly lower LBR of 39% (101/260) was seen in patients when E2 levels were < 292 pg/mL (< 1,070 pmol/L) and of 28% (14/50) when E2 levels were ≥ 409 pg/mL (≥ 1,500 pg/mL). In a logistic regression analysis, adjusting for serum P4 level ≥ 11 ng/mL or < 11 ng/mL (≥ 35 nmol or < 35 nmol/L) on the day of transfer, body mass index, age at oocyte retrieval, day 5 or 6 vitrified blastocysts, and blastocyst score, the adjusted risk difference of live birth was -0.21 (-0.32; -0.10) when the E2 level was < 292 pg/mL (< 1,070 pmol/L) and -0.31 (-0.45; -0.18) when the E2 level was ≥ 409 pg/mL (≥ 1,500 pmol/L) compared with E2 levels ≥ 292 pg/mL and < 409 pg/mL (≥ 1,070 and < 1,500 pmol/L). Importantly, only 25% of patents had optimal levels.

Conclusion

The study shows a significant association between serum E2 levels and reproductive outcomes in an HRT-FET cohort in which optimal serum P4 levels were secured. Midluteal serum E2 levels are associated with the LBR in HRT-FET cycles, and E2 levels should neither be too high nor too low.

Menopause and perimenopause definitions — Menopause is defined as the cessation of a person's menstrual cycle and is defined retrospectively, 12 months after the final menstrual period; perimenopause is the few-year time period preceding the final menstrual period, characterized by increasing menstrual cycle length variability and periods of amenorrhea and often vasomotor symptoms. US persons who reach menopause are expected on average to live more than another 30 years.

### Low-dose transdermal estradiol for symptomatic perimenopause [^e2062606]. Menopause (2004). Low credibility.

Objective

To determine whether low-dose transdermal estrogen therapy is associated with a reduction in vasomotor symptoms in women who continue to have menstrual cycles.

Design

An open-label, observational evaluation conducted over 12 months in 22 consecutive perimenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms.

Results

Improvement in vasomotor symptoms was reported by 16 (73%) of women evaluated. Of responders, 11 characterized symptom relief as complete and 6 as moderate. Fifteen (68%) of the women remained on transdermal estrogen at 12 months. No adverse health-related events were attributed to estrogen therapy.

Conclusion

Low-dose transdermal estrogen is well tolerated and was associated with a reduction in complaints of vasomotor symptoms before menopause. The steady-state pharmacokinetics of transdermal delivery of unopposed estrogen may be advantageous in a population sensitive to fluctuations in circulating hormone levels.

### Association of reproductive factors with dementia: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analyses of observational studies [^6100b2d9]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Summary

Background

Associations between endogenous estrogen exposure indicators and risk of subtypes of dementia have been unclear.

Methods

Databases (PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science) were searched electronically on 1st July and updated regularly until 12nd November 2021. Observational studies of English language were selected if reported an effect estimate [e.g. odds ratio (OR), rate ratio (RR) or hazard ratio (HR)] and 95% CI for the association between any exposure (age of menarche, age at menopause, reproductive period, estradiol level) and any endpoint variable [all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VD), cognitive impairment (CI)]. Random-effects models and dose-response meta-analyses were used to calculate estimates and to show the linear/nonlinear relationship. PROSPERO CRD42021274827.

Findings

We included 22 studies (475 9764 women) in this analysis. We found no clear relationship between late menarche (≥ 14 vs < 14 years) and dementia, CI in categorical meta-analysis compared to a J-shape relationship in dose-response meta-analyses. Later menopause (≥ 45 vs < 45 years) was consistently associated with a lower risk of all-cause dementia (pooled RR: 0.87, 95%CI: 0.78–0.97, I² = 56.0%), AD (0.67, 0.44–0.99, I² = 78.3%), VD (0.87, 0.80–0.94) and CI (0.82, 0.71–0.94, I² = 19.3%) in categorical meta-analysis, showing similar results in dose-response meta-analyses. An inverse relationship between longer reproductive duration (≥ 35 vs < 35 years) and dementia was observed in dose-response meta-analysis. In addition, estradiol levels after menopause were inversely correlated with the risk of AD and CI.

Interpretation

In this study, later menopause and longer reproductive period were associated with a lower risk of dementia, while the relationship for menarchal age was J-shaped. There was an inverse relationship between higher postmenopausal estrogen levels and risk of AD and CI. Longitudinal study are needed to further explore the association between life-time estrogen exposure and risk of subtypes of dementia.

### Standards of care for the health of transgender and gender diverse people, version 8 [^024cdd70]. International Journal of Transgender Health (2022). High credibility.

Hormone therapy — indications, safety, and monitoring: Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) persons may require medically necessary gender-affirming hormone therapy (GAHT) to achieve changes consistent with their embodied goals, gender identity, or both, and when provided under medical supervision, GAHT in adults is safe, though there are some potential long-term risks and careful monitoring and screening are required to reduce adverse events. In general, the goal is to target serum levels of the sex steroids to match the levels associated with the individual's gender identity, although optimal target ranges have not been established, and health care professionals can use serum testosterone and/or estradiol levels to monitor most sex steroid treatments; however, conjugated estrogens or synthetic estrogen use cannot be monitored. For estrogen therapy, monitoring of the estrone to estradiol ratio is not supported by the current published evidence, previously used conjugated estrogens have been abandoned in favor of bioidentical estrogens, and no randomized controlled trials have taken place in postmenopausal women or in transgender people undergoing estrogen treatment.

### The range and variation in serum estradiol concentration in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women treated with transdermal estradiol in a real-world setting: a cross-sectional study [^b73350a0]. Menopause (2025). Medium credibility.

DISCUSSION

The aim of this study was to measure the range and interindividual variation in serum estradiol concentration in women treated with transdermal estradiol, and to estimate the prevalence of "poor absorbers" (women using licensed doses with subtherapeutic levels). To our knowledge, this is the largest study to measure hormone levels in women using transdermal estradiol, and the first to include both perimenopausal and postmenopausal women, using both licensed and off-label doses, in a real-world clinic setting.

The median estradiol level was 355.26 pmol/L (IQR 198.44–646.15 pmol/L) in keeping with data that suggest the optimal level for symptom relief is around 400 pmol/L for most women.

The reference range for serum estradiol concentration in perimenopausal and postmenopausal HT users attending a private menopause clinic was 54.62–2,050.55 pmol/L (14.88–558.53 pg/mL). This is wider than the physiological reference range in premenopausal women (110–1,300 pmol/L or 30–350 pg/mL). In premenopausal women, preovulatory estradiol levels typically peak at 550 to 1,300 pmol/L, but values of up to 2,750 pmol/L have been reported. Estradiol levels can be up to 30% higher in perimenopausal women due to dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and/or luteal-out-of-phase events. An additive effect will be observed in women using exogenous estrogen (HT). This accounts for the wide range in serum estradiol concentration in the study cohort, especially in perimenopausal women (88.54–3,151.62 pmol/L), and illustrates the importance of not relying on blood tests to diagnose perimenopause or to guide HT (estradiol) dose decisions.

### Serum estradiol level and risk of breast cancer during treatment with raloxifene [^c569274d]. JAMA (2002). Excellent credibility.

Context

As endogenous estradiol increases, risk of breast cancer increases. Raloxifene competes with endogenous estrogen for binding to estrogen receptors in breast tissue. A woman's estradiol level may alter the effects of raloxifene on breast cancer and other outcomes.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that raloxifene reduces breast cancer risk more in women with relatively high estradiol levels than in women with very low estradiol levels.

Design

Analysis of the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted from 1994 to 1999.

Setting

One hundred eighty community settings and medical practices in 25 countries including the United States.

Participants

A total of 7290 postmenopausal women aged 80 years or younger with osteoporosis who had baseline serum estradiol concentrations measured by a central laboratory using a sensitive assay. Women with a history of breast cancer or estrogen use were excluded.

Intervention

Participants were randomly assigned to receive 60 mg/d or 120 mg/d of raloxifene (n = 4843) or matching placebo (n = 2447) for 4 years.

Main Outcome Measure

New cases of histopathologically confirmed breast cancer in the treatment and placebo groups, stratified by estradiol levels.

Results

In the placebo group, women with estradiol levels greater than 10 pmol/L (2.7 pg/mL) had a 6.8-fold higher rate of breast cancer (3.0% per 4 years; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.8%-4.1%) than that of women with undetectable estradiol levels (0.6% per 4 years; 95% CI, 0%-1.1%; P = 0.005 for trend). Women with estradiol levels greater than 10 pmol/L in the raloxifene group had a rate of breast cancer that was 76% (95% CI, 53%-88%) lower than that of women with estradiol levels greater than 10 pmol/L in the placebo group (absolute rate reduction, 2.2% [95% CI, 1.0%-3.5%; number needed to treat = 45]). In contrast, women with undetectable estradiol levels had similar breast cancer risk whether or not they were treated with raloxifene (risk difference, -0.1%; 95% CI, -0.8% to 0.6%; P = 0.02 for the interaction). In this cohort, treating women with estradiol levels greater than 10 pmol/L with raloxifene for 4 years would have avoided 47% of breast cancer cases.

Conclusions

Measurement of estradiol level by sensitive assay in postmenopausal women identifies those at high risk of breast cancer who may benefit most from raloxifene. If confirmed, this suggests that measuring estradiol and treating women with high estradiol levels could substantially reduce the rate of breast cancer among postmenopausal women.

### Executive summary of the stages of reproductive aging workshop + 10: addressing the unfinished agenda of staging reproductive aging [^f51cbbca]. Menopause (2012). Medium credibility.

Hysterectomy and endometrial ablation — women who have undergone these procedures cannot be staged by menstrual bleeding criteria and can only be assessed using supportive criteria (endocrine markers of ovarian aging). It is recommended that clinicians and researchers wait at least 3 months after surgery to assess endocrine status, as pelvic surgeries may transiently raise FSH levels; in most cases staging will be limited to classifying premenopausal or postmenopausal status. A single sample for FSH and estradiol may be ambiguous or misleading, and at least one repeated measurement is often required.

### Premenopausal endogenous oestrogen levels and breast cancer risk: a meta-analysis [^b9e12b7c]. British Journal of Cancer (2011). Low credibility.

Table 2 reports estimates of the geometric mean and geometric s.d. of E2 in cases and controls, within each study. The pooled geometric s.d. was close to 2 (1.91), indicating that levels 1 s.d. above the (geometric) mean were approximately double the geometric mean, while levels 1 s.d. below the geometric mean were approximately half of it. The estimated odds ratios for a doubling of E2 for each study, with a pooled odds ratio from the random-effect meta-analysis, (a) including the luteal estimate from the study by) and (b) using the follicular estimate from this study, are summarised in Figure 1. There was weak evidence of a positive association between circulating levels of E2 and breast cancer risk, with a doubling of E2 conferring a 10% (95% CI: −4, 27; P = 0.08) to 14% (95% CI: −2, 32; P = 0.17) increase in the odds of developing breast cancer, depending on which estimate is included from the) study. Assuming that E2 is approximately log-normally distributed with geometric s.d. 1.91, our more conservative estimate equates to distributions in cases and controls 0.091 (95% CI: −0.039, 0.222) s.d. values apart and hence to an odds ratio of 1.26 (95% CI: 0.90, 1.76) comparing women in the top and bottom quartiles of E2. Table 3 reports estimated odds ratios for a selection of percentage increases in E2.

### Female reproductive health after childhood, adolescent, and young adult cancers: guidelines for the assessment and management of female reproductive complications [^2c05ae54]. Journal of Clinical Oncology (2013). Medium credibility.

Assessment — COG-LTFU screening and evaluation: The COG-LTFU Guidelines recommend regular screening of patients at risk of hypogonadism to identify gonadotropin deficiency, delayed or arrested puberty, AOF, or POF. In prepubertal survivors, onset and tempo of puberty, menstrual history, and Tanner stage are evaluated annually until sexual maturity, and baseline LH, FSH, and estradiol levels should be assessed at age 13 years. In sexually mature patients, evaluation should include menstrual and pregnancy history and history of sexual difficulties or changes, and those with delayed puberty, irregular menses, primary or secondary amenorrhea, and/or clinical signs and symptoms of estrogen deficiency should have LH, FSH, and estradiol levels screened. Bone mineral density tests should be considered for hypogonadal patients, and referral to an endocrinologist or gynecologist is warranted by signs and symptoms of ovarian dysfunction and/or abnormal hormone levels; it is vital to counsel women who received gonadotoxic therapy regarding their risk of POF.

### Does luteal estradiol supplementation have a role in long agonist cycles? [^1352b621]. Fertility and Sterility (2010). Low credibility.

Objective

To test the hypothesis that the addition of 6 mg estradiol (E2) valerate either orally or vaginally to progesterone (P) for luteal support, can increase the probability of pregnancy in intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles using the long agonist protocol.

Design

Prospective open-labeled randomized controlled trial.

Setting

Private and university fertility centers.

Participant(S)

Women undergoing ICSI cycles, with controlled ovarian hyperstimulation using long agonist protocol.

Intervention(S)

On embryo transfer day, participants were randomized to receive, only P (group A, n = 90), P along with 6 mg E(2) valerate either orally (group B, n = 90), or vaginally (group C, n = 90) for luteal support.

Main Outcome Measure(S)

Clinical pregnancy was the main outcome. luteal serum E(2) and P profiles were the secondary outcomes.

Result(S)

Highest pregnancy rate was achieved in group C (45.56%), it was significantly higher than A (relative risk 1.52, 95% CI: 1.03 to 2.24). Day 0 (hCG day) E2 levels were similar in the three groups. Group A had lower E2 levels on days 7, 10, and 13 and a higher magnitude of E2 decline on days 7 and 10. Similar levels of luteal E2 were documented in groups B and C. P levels were similar in the three groups.

Conclusions(S)

Addition of 6 mg E(2) valerate to P support may encumber the sharp decline in luteal E(2) level. It may enhance the probability of pregnancy if administered vaginally.

### Clinical practice guidelines for the care of girls and women with Turner syndrome [^5b820337]. European Journal of Endocrinology (2024). High credibility.

Regarding medical management for Turner syndrome, more specifically with respect to female sex hormones (estrogen), ESE/PES 2024 guidelines recommend to consider initiating treatment with low dose 17β-estradiol simultaneously with GH in patients with a later diagnosis (> 12 years) having short stature and remaining growth potential.

### Luteinizing hormone (LH) and estradiol suppression and growth in girls with central precocious puberty: is more suppression better? Are pre-injection LH levels useful in monitoring treatment? [^3705265f]. Journal of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism (2007). Low credibility.

Context

Girls with central precocious puberty (CPP) are treated with gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues to suppress puberty. Gonadotropin levels are used to monitor treatment, since estradiol is difficult to measure at low levels. The optimal degree of hormonal suppression is still unknown.

Objective

We hypothesized that in girls treated for CPP, estradiol levels (by ultrasensitive bioassay) would correlate with the rate of skeletal maturation and linear growth velocity. We asked whether predicted height would improve with greater luteinizing hormone (LH) and estradiol suppression. We also compared pre- and post-injection LH levels for monitoring treatment.

Design

Thirty girls with CPP were followed for up to 2 years during treatment with leuprolide acetate depot at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg/28 days. We measured LH and estradiol levels, bone age, and growth velocity every 6 months.

Results

Estradiol levels were suppressed to below the detection limit in three-quarters of the girls and did not correlate with the rate of skeletal maturation or linear growth. Improvement in predicted height correlated significantly with lower pre-injection LH levels. These girls have some of the lowest estradiol and LH levels, best improvement in predicted height, and least amount of bone age advancement published to date. Pre- and post-leuprolide injection LH levels were positively correlated.

Conclusions

Greater LH suppression may improve height outcome in girls treated for CPP with GnRH analogues. The degree of LH suppression achieved is individualized and not necessarily related to absolute dose. Pre-injection LH levels may be useful for monitoring treatment. Ultrasensitive estradiol levels were very low and usually unmeasurable, affirming the increased suppression at the higher doses of GnRH analogue used in these girls. Further investigation is needed, with longer treatment duration, a range of doses, and ultimately final height. Until such studies are completed, clinicians should be cautious when interpreting pubertal suppression.

### Health care for transgender and gender diverse individuals: ACOG committee opinion, number 823 [^f023dc26]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2021). High credibility.

Feminizing therapy — estrogen and antiandrogen use, targets, and monitoring highlights risk considerations, preferred formulations, titration goals, and laboratory schedules. Risks include venous thromboembolic embolism (VTE), hypertriglyceridemia, development of gallstones, and elevated liver enzymes. Ethinyl estradiol may increase the risk of VTE; therefore, because cycle control is unnecessary for transgender women, its use is not indicated, and transdermal preparations of estradiol typically used for hormone replacement therapy are recommended for those with risk factors; if using oral estrogens, 17-β estradiol preparations are preferred, and in general, prescribing the smallest dose possible to achieve desired effects is recommended. Antiandrogens such as spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists, and 5-α reductase inhibitors are used to reduce endogenous testosterone; cyproterone is not available in the United States because of concern for hepatotoxicity, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists are often expensive, so are not widely used, and spironolactone is the most commonly used antiandrogen in the United States; because of the risk of hyperkalemia with these medications, it is important to monitor patients' blood pressure and potassium levels. Although currently available data do not provide clear guidance on titration of dosing, it generally should be based on patient goals. Doses should be titrated to physiologic effects, with goals to maintain estradiol at the mean daily levels for premenopausal women (less than 200 ng/ml) and testosterone in female range (less than 55 ng/dl). Recommended laboratory surveillance includes estradiol and total testosterone levels, sex hormone binding globulin, and albumin levels every 3 months in the first year to titrate estrogen dosing. After the first year, laboratory tests are necessary only if there are patient or health care professional concerns about adverse effects or after a change in dosage. Patients taking spironolactone also should be tested for potassium and creatinine levels every 3 months for first year and then yearly. Notably, feminizing hormones do not result in substantial changes to voice.

### Association of reproductive factors with dementia: a systematic review and dose-response meta-analyses of observational studies [^fc756339]. EClinicalMedicine (2022). Medium credibility.

Background

Associations between endogenous estrogen exposure indicators and risk of subtypes of dementia have been unclear.

Methods

Databases (PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science) were searched electronically on 1st July and updated regularly until 12nd November 2021. Observational studies of English language were selected if reported an effect estimate [e.g., odds ratio (OR), rate ratio (RR) or hazard ratio (HR)] and 95% CI for the association between any exposure (age of menarche, age at menopause, reproductive period, estradiol level) and any endpoint variable [all-cause dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VD), cognitive impairment (CI)]. Random-effects models and dose-response meta-analyses were used to calculate estimates and to show the linear/nonlinear relationship. PROSPERO CRD42021274827.

Findings

We included 22 studies (475 9764 women) in this analysis. We found no clear relationship between late menarche (≥ 14 vs < 14 years) and dementia, CI in categorical meta-analysis compared to a J-shape relationship in dose-response meta-analyses. Later menopause (≥ 45 vs < 45 years) was consistently associated with a lower risk of all-cause dementia (pooled RR: 0.87, 95%CI: 0.78–0.97, I² = 56.0%), AD (0.67, 0.44–0.99, I² = 78.3%), VD (0.87, 0.80–0.94) and CI (0.82, 0.71–0.94, I² = 19.3%) in categorical meta-analysis, showing similar results in dose-response meta-analyses. An inverse relationship between longer reproductive duration (≥ 35 vs < 35 years) and dementia was observed in dose-response meta-analysis. In addition, estradiol levels after menopause were inversely correlated with the risk of AD and CI.

Interpretation

In this study, later menopause and longer reproductive period were associated with a lower risk of dementia, while the relationship for menarchal age was J-shaped. There was an inverse relationship between higher postmenopausal estrogen levels and risk of AD and CI.

### Compounded bioidentical menopausal hormone therapy: ACOG clinical consensus no. 6 [^d4f561d1]. Obstetrics and Gynecology (2023). High credibility.

Compounded versus FDA-approved menopausal hormone therapy — compounded bioidentical menopausal hormone formulations lack rigorous quality control or oversight, which can result in variable absorption and potency (causing too high or low levels), purity, and quality, as opposed to the proven pharmacokinetics of FDA-approved formulations, and clinicians should counsel patients that FDA-approved menopausal hormone therapies are recommended for the management of menopausal symptoms over compounded bioidentical menopausal hormone therapy; additionally, FDA-approved patches provide an advantage over oral hormones because they provide a more consistent delivery, with a relatively steady level of estradiol, and may have a lower risk of venous thromboembolism (23).

### Effect modifiers of low-dose tamoxifen in a randomized trial in breast noninvasive disease [^589f395b]. Clinical Cancer Research (2021). Medium credibility.

Purpose

Low-dose tamoxifen halved recurrence after surgery in a phase III trial in breast noninvasive disease without increasing adverse events. We explored the effect of low-dose tamoxifen in clinically relevant subgroups, including menopausal status, estradiol levels, smoking, body mass index, and proliferation of baseline lesion.

Patients and Methods

Incidence of invasive breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ was the primary endpoint. HRs and interaction terms were estimated using Cox models.

Results

A favorable HR and 95% confidence interval (CI) could be demonstrated for postmenopausal status (HR = 0.30; 95% CI, 0.11–0.82 vs. HR = 0.73; 95% CI, 0.30–1.76 in premenopausal women; P interaction = 0.13), women with estradiol less than 15.8 pg/mL, presence of menopausal symptoms at baseline, and never smoking (P interaction = 0.07), although the interaction P value was > 0.05 for all characteristics. Efficacy was similar in all body mass index categories. Tumors with Ki-67 above the median level of 10% had a greater benefit (HR = 0.27; 95% CI, 0.09–0.81) than those with Ki-67 ≤ 10% (HR = 1.58; 95% CI, 0.45–5.60; P interaction = 0.04).

Conclusions

The efficacy of low-dose tamoxifen seems to be greater in postmenopausal women and in women with lower estradiol levels. Benefits appear to be larger also in women with menopausal symptoms, never smokers, and tumors with Ki-67 > 10%. Our results by menopausal status provide important insight into low-dose tamoxifen personalized treatment, although caution is necessary given their exploratory nature. Observation of an improved response in tumors with Ki-67 > 10% is consistent but the use of the marker in this setting is investigational. See related commentary by Fabian, p. 3510.

### Estradiol (climara) [^aa09c587]. FDA (2023). Medium credibility.

Dose proportionality was also demonstrated for the Climara transdermal system (12.5 cm2and 25 cm2) in a 1-week study conducted in 54 postmenopausal women. The mean steady state levels (Cavg) of the estradiol during the application of Climara 25 cm2and 12.5 cm2on the abdomen were about 80 and 40 pg/mL, respectively.

In a 3-week multiple application study in 24 postmenopausal women, the 25 cm2Climara transdermal system produced average peak estradiol concentrations (Cmax) of approximately 100 pg/mL. Trough values at the end of each wear interval (Cmin) were approximately 35 pg/mL. Nearly identical serum curves were seen each week, indicating little or no accumulation of estradiol in the body. Serum estrone peak and trough levels were 60 and 40 pg/mL, respectively.

In a single dose, randomized, crossover study conducted to compare the effect of site of application, 38 postmenopausal women wore a single Climara 25 cm2transdermal system for 1 week on the abdomen and buttocks. The estradiol serum concentration profiles are shown in Figure 2. Values of Cmaxand Cavgwere, respectively, 25 percent and 17 percent higher with the buttock application than with the abdomen application.

Table 2 provides a summary of estradiol pharmacokinetic parameters determined during evaluation of the Climara transdermal system.

The relative standard deviation of each pharmacokinetic parameter after application to the abdomen averaged 50 percent, which is indicative of the considerable intersubject variability associated with transdermal drug delivery. The relative standard deviation of each pharmacokinetic parameter after application to the buttock was lower than that after application to the abdomen (for example, for Cmax39 percent versus 62 percent, and for Cavg35 percent versus 48 percent).

Distribution

The distribution of exogenous estrogens is similar to that of endogenous estrogens. Estrogens are widely distributed in the body and are generally found in higher concentrations in the sex hormone target organs. Estrogens circulate in the blood largely bound to SHBG and albumin.

### Management of premenstrual syndrome: green-top guideline no. 48 [^7495b9c8]. BJOG (2017). Medium credibility.

Regarding medical management for premenstrual syndrome, more specifically with respect to estrogen patches and implants, RCOG 2017 guidelines recommend to consider offering a cyclical 10–12 day course of oral or vaginal progesterone or long-term progestogen with levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system 52 mg for the prevention of endometrial hyperplasia in patients receiving percutaneous estradiol.
