## Question

60-year-old female with a chronic cough not responsive to proton pump inhibitor fluticasone nasal spray and Zyrtec. She's had a negative endoscopy. What should be the next step in the workup and what is the differential diagnosis

---

## Answer

> Let's see… What do we have here? The user is asking about the next step in the workup and the differential diagnosis for a 60-year-old woman with chronic cough refractory to PPI, intranasal fluticasone, and cetirizine, with a negative upper-GI endoscopy. Let's break this down step-by-step. First, I need to think about confirming the chronic cough definition and what has already been tried. Then, I should verify missing fundamentals in the workup such as chest imaging, ACE inhibitor use, smoking/environmental exposures, and red flags. Next, I will evaluate airway eosinophilic diseases (asthma and non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis) with appropriate testing and therapeutic trials. After that, I need to reassess reflux as a cause, recognizing that a normal endoscopy does not rule out extraesophageal reflux, and decide on pH-impedance testing strategy. Finally, I will consider persistent upper-airway cough syndrome, and if no cause is found, move toward unexplained chronic cough management and referral pathways. I will anchor each step to high-credibility ACCP/CHEST, ACR, AGA/ACG, GINA, and Lyon consensus recommendations [^112EoMEf] [^116mmN88] [^116na89S] [^112vBmKr] [^116SRwRS].

> Let me first confirm the clinical problem and prior empiric therapy. A cough persisting beyond 8 weeks meets the definition of chronic cough, and the patient has already had empiric therapy targeting GERD, upper-airway cough syndrome, and allergic rhinitis, with a reportedly negative upper endoscopy; however, endoscopy lacks sensitivity for extraesophageal reflux, so a normal exam does not exclude reflux-related cough, especially nonacid reflux, and empiric PPI monotherapy often fails to improve cough without lifestyle measures [^1126Yakw] [^116mmN88] [^117MZ32D].

> Wait, let me verify the foundational next steps before diving deeper. I need to ensure a recent chest radiograph has been obtained to exclude structural, infectious, or malignant thoracic conditions; this is standard in chronic cough algorithms and is rated appropriate by the ACR Appropriateness Criteria, with higher-resolution imaging reserved for concerning findings or refractory/atypical cases [^112EoMEf] [^1126Yakw].

> I should confirm medication and exposure history because an ACE inhibitor can cause a persistent nonproductive cough that resolves after discontinuation; if she is on an ACE inhibitor, a supervised withdrawal trial of at least 4 weeks is indicated, and I also need to clarify smoking status and occupational/environmental irritant exposures that can perpetuate cough [^112rLCmQ] [^1126Yakw].

> Hold on, let's not jump to conclusions about asthma based on symptoms alone; I need objective testing. I will now examine spirometry with bronchodilator testing, and if spirometry is normal but suspicion remains, consider bronchial hyperresponsiveness testing or a monitored therapeutic trial, aligning with GINA and BTS/SIGN diagnostic frameworks for cough-variant asthma and with ACCP guidance that endorses ICS as first-line for cough-variant asthma and step-up or add-on leukotriene therapy if response is incomplete [^116SRwRS] [^115HUcnX] [^112f21xq] [^114AR4Ko].

> Let me think about airway eosinophilic inflammation beyond classic asthma. Non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis can present with chronic cough, normal spirometry, and absent airway hyperresponsiveness; noninvasive eosinophil markers or induced sputum can aid diagnosis where available, and a therapeutic trial of inhaled corticosteroids, with escalation or leukotriene inhibitors if needed, is reasonable per ACCP recommendations [^116TEfuL] [^112Fobu6].

> Next, I should review the reflux pathway carefully because the negative endoscopy could be falsely reassuring. For patients with persistent extraesophageal symptoms despite optimized acid suppression, guidelines advise ambulatory pH-impedance monitoring; testing on therapy is preferred when GERD is already established, whereas off-therapy monitoring is used when GERD is unproven, consistent with AGA updates, ACG guidance, and the Lyon Consensus 2.0, which delineate testing strategies for proven versus unproven GERD and recognize the role of nonacid reflux in refractory cough [^112b9oMg] [^116na89S] [^112vBmKr] [^115FnrUW].

> But wait, what if lifestyle contributors were not addressed during the PPI trial. I should double-check whether weight reduction, meal timing, head-of-bed elevation, and dietary modification were implemented, because CHEST's reflux–cough guideline notes that PPI monotherapy has limited benefit for cough, whereas comprehensive lifestyle strategies can improve outcomes, and empiric escalation without objective reflux evidence is discouraged by modern consensus statements [^116mmN88] [^111ssd36].

> I need to check whether upper-airway cough syndrome was adequately explored beyond an intranasal steroid and second-generation antihistamine. Failure to respond may reflect nonallergic rhinitis or chronic rhinosinusitis; ENT evaluation and, when indicated, sinus CT can identify anatomic disease, and limited interventional data suggest multimodal intranasal therapy can reduce cough in selected patients, though higher-quality trials are needed; UACS remains a leading cause in adults and warrants thorough reassessment [^1157cAAZ] [^1126Yakw] [^1166vxx8].

> Hmm, wait a minute, I initially thought the ACCP 2020 cough guideline supporting eosinophilic airway disease was tagged as f2c5d9d4 — hold on, I should verify; the correct reference id is f2c5d9c4, and its recommendations reinforce ICS initiation for cough-variant asthma with step-up strategies if cough persists after reconsidering alternative causes [^117CvTe3].

> If objective testing and targeted trials for asthma, NAEB, UACS, and reflux are unrevealing, I need to ensure we consider the entity of unexplained chronic cough, which often reflects cough hypersensitivity syndrome; in this scenario, CHEST recommends against inhaled corticosteroids when eosinophilia and bronchial hyperresponsiveness are absent, and supports nonpharmacologic speech-language pathology therapy and selected neuromodulators such as gabapentin or pregabalin in appropriate patients, ideally with specialist referral [^112d375d] [^1126Yakw].

> Let me reconsider sequencing and referrals to keep the plan pragmatic. Near-term steps should include chest radiography if not done, meticulous medication and exposure review with ACE inhibitor cessation if relevant, spirometry with bronchodilator and, if needed, methacholine or a monitored ICS-based trial for cough-variant asthma or NAEB, ENT assessment for refractory upper-airway contributors, and, if reflux remains suspected after these steps, ambulatory pH-impedance monitoring aligned with AGA/ACG/Lyon guidance; complex or multifactorial cases benefit from a multidisciplinary approach encompassing pulmonology, allergy, ENT, and gastroenterology input [^112EoMEf] [^112f21xq] [^116TEfuL] [^112b9oMg] [^1161MnkZ].

---

The next step is to obtain **spirometry with bronchodilator testing** to evaluate for asthma or COPD, and if spirometry is normal, proceed to **methacholine challenge** to assess for cough-variant asthma or non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis. If these are negative, order a **chest CT** to exclude interstitial lung disease, bronchiectasis, or malignancy [^112EoMEf], and consider **pH-impedance monitoring** to detect non-acid reflux [^112b9oMg] if GERD remains suspected [^112vBmKr]. The differential includes asthma, non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, COPD, interstitial lung disease, bronchiectasis [^112EoMEf], malignancy, non-acid reflux [^116mmN88], medication-induced cough (e.g. ACE inhibitors) [^112rLCmQ], and idiopathic chronic cough [^112d375d].

---

## Differential diagnosis

The **differential diagnosis** of chronic cough unresponsive to initial therapies includes:

- **Asthma (including cough-variant asthma)**: Chronic cough may be the sole manifestation of asthma [^1125pDsC] [^112f21xq].

- **Non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis**: Characterized by eosinophilic airway inflammation without bronchial hyperresponsiveness [^1125pDsC] [^116TEfuL].

- **Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)**: Particularly in smokers or former smokers [^113jzXcQ].

- **Interstitial lung disease**: Includes idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and other interstitial lung diseases [^112EoMEf].

- **Bronchiectasis**: Chronic productive cough with recurrent infections [^117K6qX3].

- **Malignancy**: Lung cancer or other thoracic malignancies [^115GsoSY].

- **Non-acid reflux**: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with non-acid reflux episodes [^112b9oMg].

- **Medication-induced cough**: ACE inhibitors and other medications [^112rLCmQ].

- **Idiopathic chronic cough**: Chronic cough with no identifiable cause after comprehensive evaluation [^112d375d].

---

## Recommended next steps in diagnostic workup

Given the patient's chronic cough unresponsive to initial therapies and a negative endoscopy, the following **diagnostic steps** are recommended:

---

### Pulmonary function testing (spirometry)

Spirometry with bronchodilator testing is essential to evaluate for **asthma**, **COPD**, or other obstructive lung diseases [^115HUcnX]. If spirometry is normal, a **methacholine challenge test** can identify bronchial hyperresponsiveness indicative of cough-variant asthma or non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis.

---

### Imaging studies

A **chest radiograph** is the initial imaging test to rule out malignancy, infection, or other serious pulmonary conditions [^113jzXcQ]. If the chest radiograph is normal but suspicion remains for interstitial lung disease, bronchiectasis, or malignancy, **high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT)** is indicated [^112EoMEf].

---

### Gastroesophageal reflux evaluation

Ambulatory pH-impedance monitoring [^116na89S] is recommended if GERD remains suspected despite negative endoscopy and PPI therapy, as **non-acid reflux** can cause chronic cough [^112b9oMg].

---

### Medication review

Review current medications, specifically assessing for **ACE inhibitors** or other agents known to cause chronic cough [^112rLCmQ].

---

### Specialist referral

Pulmonology referral is recommended if initial pulmonary evaluations are inconclusive, allowing further evaluation, including possible **bronchoscopy** [^1125pDsC]. Otolaryngology referral is appropriate if **upper airway cough syndrome** or **laryngeal pathology** is suspected [^113jzXcQ].

---

## Summary of recommended diagnostic algorithm

| **Step** | **Diagnostic test** | **Purpose** |
|-|-|-|
| 1 | Spirometry with bronchodilator [^115HUcnX] [^1125pDsC] | - Evaluate for asthma <br/> - COPD |
| 2 | Methacholine challenge | - Identify cough-variant asthma <br/> - Non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis |
| 3 | Chest radiograph [^113jzXcQ] | - Rule out malignancy <br/> - Infection |
| 4 | High-resolution CT [^112EoMEf] | - Evaluate interstitial lung disease <br/> - Bronchiectasis <br/> - Malignancy |
| 5 | Ambulatory pH-impedance monitoring [^112vBmKr] | Detect non-acid reflux |
| 6 | Medication review [^112rLCmQ] | Identify medication-induced cough |
| 7 | Specialist referral | - Pulmonology <br/> - Otolaryngology |

---

The next step in the diagnostic workup for a 60-year-old female with chronic cough unresponsive to initial therapies and negative endoscopy is to **perform spirometry with bronchodilator testing**, followed by methacholine challenge if spirometry is normal. Additional imaging and reflux evaluation may be necessary based on initial results.

### Evaluation of the patient with chronic cough [^1125pDsC]. American Family Physician (2004). Low credibility.

Patients with chronic cough should avoid exposure to irritants that can trigger cough, and those who smoke should stop smoking. Patients who develop chronic cough in association with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy should be switched to an agent from another drug class. If the cough persists, a chest radiograph should be ordered to rule out malignancy and other serious conditions.

Postnasal drip syndrome, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease are the most likely causes of chronic cough in adults. If postnasal drip syndrome is suspected, a trial of a decongestant and a first-generation antihistamine is warranted. Pulmonary function testing with a methacholine challenge is the preferred test for confirming the diagnosis of asthma. Gastroesophageal reflux disease usually is diagnosed based on the symptoms and following a trial of therapy.

If the cause of chronic cough remains unclear, high-resolution computed tomographic scanning of the chest, bronchoscopy, and referral to a pulmonary specialist may be indicated. The approach to diagnosing chronic cough in immunocompromised patients and children is similar to the approach in immunocompetent adults. However, a CD4+ cell count can help determine the potential for opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients.

Respiratory tract infections, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease are the most common causes of chronic cough in children. Foreign body aspiration should be considered in young children. Congenital conditions, cystic fibrosis, and immune disorders are possible diagnoses in children with chronic cough.

### ACR appropriateness criteria® chronic cough [^112EoMEf]. Journal of the American College of Radiology (2021). High credibility.

Chronic cough is defined by a duration lasting at least 8 weeks. The most common causes of chronic cough include smoking-related lung disease, upper airway cough syndrome, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis. The etiology of chronic cough in some patients may be difficult to localize to an isolated source and is often multifactorial. The complex pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and variable manifestations of chronic cough underscore the challenges faced by clinicians in the evaluation and management of these patients.

Imaging plays a role in the initial evaluation, although there is a lack of high-quality evidence guiding which modalities are useful and at what point in time the clinical evaluation should be performed. The American College of Radiology Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel. The guideline development and revision include an extensive analysis of medical literature from peer-reviewed journals and the application of well-established methodologies (RAND/UCLA Appropriateness Method and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE) to rate the appropriateness of imaging and treatment procedures for specific clinical scenarios. In those instances where evidence is lacking or equivocal, expert opinion may supplement the available evidence to recommend imaging or treatment.

Regarding specific circumstances for gastroesophageal reflux disease, and more specifically concerning patients with extraesophageal symptoms, the AGA 2023 guidelines recommend considering testing in patients with an established objective diagnosis of GERD who are not responding to high doses of acid suppression. It is advisable to obtain pH-impedance monitoring while on acid suppression to evaluate the role of ongoing acid or non-acid reflux.

### Nonacid reflux in patients with chronic cough on acid-suppressive therapy [^115FnrUW]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

It is generally accepted that extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) symptoms and their persistence despite acid-suppressive therapy are poor prognostic factors for antireflux surgery. Recent studies indicating that cough can be temporally associated with reflux episodes of pH 4 to 7 (i.e. nonacid reflux) reinvigorate the need for a more careful workup in patients with cough suspected to be due to GERD.

- **Aim**: To evaluate the frequency of chronic cough associated with nonacid reflux and the response of these patients to laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication.

- **Methods**: We retrospectively reviewed data from patients with persistent cough despite twice-daily proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, with or without the use of nighttime regimens of histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H2RA). These patients had undergone combined multichannel intraluminal impedance and pH monitoring. The association of cough and reflux was evaluated by calculating the symptom index (SI), which is considered positive if ≥ 50%. A subset of patients with positive SI values for impedance-detected reflux while on therapy was referred for laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication.

- **Results**: Of 50 patients (38 female; mean age, 43 years; age range, 6 months to 84 years) who were monitored while receiving therapy, 13 patients (26%) had a positive SI for cough. The SI-positive group had a lower percentage of female patients and comprised patients of younger age compared to the SI-negative group. Laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication was performed in six SI-positive patients who became asymptomatic and stopped receiving acid-suppressive therapy.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for gastroesophageal reflux disease, particularly upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, the ASGE 2025 guidelines recommend considering endoscopic evaluation in patients with GERD symptoms but without alarm symptoms if they have risk factors for Barrett's esophagus. These risk factors include a family history of Barrett's esophagus or esophageal adenocarcinoma, or the presence of GERD plus another risk factor, such as age ≥ 50 years, male sex, white race, smoking, or obesity.

### Management of chronic cough [^111BRZhf]. The Lancet (2008). Low credibility.

Cough that remains unexplained after basic clinical assessment is a common reason for referral to secondary care. Much of the evidence about the management of isolated chronic cough is derived from case series; this evidence suggests that isolated chronic cough is usually due to asthma, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, and upper airway conditions, and that it can be cured in most people by treating these conditions. However, there is increasing recognition that satisfactory control of chronic cough is not achieved in a substantial number of patients seen in secondary care. Moreover, there is a concern that perpetuation of the belief that chronic cough is solely due to the effects of comorbid conditions inhibits research into the pathophysiology of an abnormally heightened cough reflex and jeopardizes the development of improved treatments.

We advocate a change in emphasis, which makes a clear distinction between cough due to corticosteroid-responsive eosinophilic airway diseases and corticosteroid-resistant non-eosinophilic cough. We recommend that some factors with weak evidence of an association with cough are best viewed as potential aggravating factors of an intrinsic abnormality of the cough reflex, rather than the cause. We call for more research into the basic mechanisms and pharmacological control of an abnormally heightened cough reflex, and recommend ways to assess the effects of potentially antitussive treatments.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease and chronic cough: A possible mechanism elucidated by ambulatory pH-impedance-pressure monitoring [^1125dJhj]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2019). Low credibility.

The pathophysiological mechanisms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)-related chronic cough (CC) are unclear. This study aimed to determine the mechanism of reflux-induced cough by synchronous monitoring of reflux episodes, esophageal motility, and cough.

Patients with GERD were prospectively enrolled and classified into GERD with CC (GERD-CC) and without CC (GERD) groups. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory pH-impedance-pressure monitoring was performed to analyze reflux patterns, esophageal motility during prolonged exposure to acid, and characteristics of reflux episodes that induced coughing paroxysms.

Thirty-one patients with GERD-CC and 47 with GERD were enrolled; all of their monitoring results fulfilled the criteria for diagnosis of GERD. Patients with GERD-CC had higher reflux symptom scores, longer exposure to acid, higher DeMeester scores, more frequent reflux episodes, a greater proximal extent of reflux detected by impedance, and a higher percentage of strongly acidic reflux compared to patients in the GERD group (all P < 0.05). Of the 63 reflux-cough episodes identified in the GERD-CC group, 74.6% of distal reflux and 67.0% of proximal reflux episodes were acidic. More patients exhibited low pan-esophageal pressure in primary peristalsis (48.5% vs. 11.8%, P < 0.001) and synchronous contraction in secondary peristalsis during prolonged exposure to acid in the GERD-CC than in the GERD group (63.9% vs. 9.1%, P < 0.001).

Proximal acidic reflux and distal reflux-reflex are jointly associated with reflux-induced cough in patients.

### Managing chronic cough due to asthma and NAEB in adults and adolescents: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^117CvTe3]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic cough, particularly in patients with asthma, ACCP 2020 guidelines recommend considering a step-up in the dose of ICSs and administering a therapeutic trial of a leukotriene inhibitor. This should be done after reconsideration of alternative causes of cough in adult and adolescent patients if the response is incomplete in patients with cough variant asthma, or if cough is the remaining isolated symptom in patients with cough as one of the symptoms of asthma.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^11546ei1]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

The 2022 ACG guidelines for gastroesophageal reflux disease emphasize that, in cases involving extraesophageal symptoms, such as GERD-related asthma, chronic cough, or laryngopharyngeal reflux, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy should not be performed for diagnosis.

### Managing chronic cough due to asthma and NAEB in adults and adolescents: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112f21xq]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for chronic cough, more specifically with respect to patients with asthma, ACCP 2020 guidelines recommend initiating ICSs as first-line therapy in adult and adolescent patients where chronic cough is the unique symptom (cough variant asthma).

### Postnasal drip and chronic cough: An open interventional study [^1166vxx8]. Respiratory Medicine (2009). Low credibility.

The postnasal drip (PND) syndrome is often linked as a cause of chronic cough, although this is disputed.

- **Objectives**: We examined the effect of specific topical treatment of rhinosinusitis on cough in patients presenting with a chronic cough associated with a postnasal drip or 'nasal catarrh'.
- **Methods**: Patients presenting with a chronic cough and who complained of PND were enrolled. Symptoms of PND and cough were assessed by questionnaire and by a capsaicin cough response. Rhinosinusitis was assessed by questionnaires, direct examination of the nose, and by high-resolution computed tomography. In an open study, they were treated with fluticasone nasules, ipratropium bromide, and azelastine nasal sprays for 28 days, after which they were re-assessed.

- **Results**: Eighteen out of 21 patients completed the study. All patients reported having the presence of mucus in the throat. Mean cough score improved post-treatment (p < 0.05), but there was no significant change in capsaicin cough sensitivity or nasal catarrh questionnaire score. There was improvement in anterior nasal discharge symptom scores (p = 0.005) and in endoscopic nasal scores post-treatment (p < 0.01), with a tendency to improved PND scores.

- **Conclusion**: In a pilot open 'real-life' study, treatment targeted towards rhinosinusitis accompanying PND syndrome and chronic cough led to an improvement in cough. A randomised controlled study is now needed to confirm or refute these findings.

### Investigation of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease [^111TPifW]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Beside asthma and postnasal drip, GERD has been confirmed to be one of the main three causes of chronic cough, accounting for around 20% of cases. Chronic cough is defined as a cough that persists for longer than 8 weeks. GERD should be investigated in patients who are not taking any cough-inducing medications, are non-smokers or not exposed to other environmental irritants, and have normal x-rays with no evidence of asthma or postnasal drip. The American College of Chest Physicians suggests that GERD-related cough typically occurs during the daytime, in the upright position, and is non-productive.

Irritation of the upper respiratory tract with or without microaspiration is reported as a possible mechanism, but this hypothesis remains controversial. Microaspiration may occur due to impairment of protective reflexes or due to excessive challenges to pharyngeal reflexes. Several studies have reported ineffective esophageal peristalsis in patients with chronic cough, with or without acid reflux, suggesting that poor esophageal clearance might be related to cough episodes. On the other hand, infusion of acid into the distal esophagus increases the frequency of coughing and cough reflex sensitivity. In a recent study, it was found that the proximal extent of reflux events is not important for the provocation of cough. Both central and local reflexes are considered to induce cough. In addition, cough itself may promote reflux events. An increase in intra-abdominal pressure during cough episodes may provoke reflux events by overcoming lower esophageal sphincter barriers.

### Global strategy for asthma management and prevention [^116SRwRS]. GINA (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for asthma, specifically concerning screening for GERD, the GINA 2025 guidelines recommend considering GERD as a possible cause of a dry cough in patients with confirmed asthma. However, they advise against obtaining screening for GERD in patients with uncontrolled asthma.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^114cCD18]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for gastroesophageal reflux disease, specifically concerning upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, the ACG 2022 guidelines recommend performing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. This should ideally take place after proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are stopped for 2–4 weeks if classic GERD symptoms do not respond adequately to an 8-week empiric trial of PPIs or if symptoms return when PPIs are discontinued.

### Investigation of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease [^116jaSPh]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a commonly diagnosed chronic disorder in Western countries. According to the Montreal Classification, GERD is defined as a condition that develops when the reflux of stomach contents causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications. Despite typically presenting with esophageal symptoms such as heartburn and regurgitation, GERD may also present with extraesophageal symptoms. The most common extraesophageal manifestations include chronic cough, asthma, and laryngitis.

There are two proposed mechanisms to explain extraesophageal syndromes caused by GERD. The first is the direct way via irritation and/or microaspiration. The second is an indirect, vagally mediated way. Irritation occurs with the entrance of gastroduodenal contents into the pharynx and larynx, with or without microaspiration in deeper airways, due to the disturbance of normal protective mechanisms. In the second mechanism, symptoms are caused by a vagally mediated esophago-tracheal-bronchial reflex when reflux reaches the lower esophagus. Embryological studies show that the esophagus and bronchial tree share common innervation via the vagus nerve.

Currently, several tests have improved the diagnosis of typical GERD. However, investigating extraesophageal manifestations of GERD remains challenging, and new methods and studies are needed to address these diagnostic challenges.

### Taming chronic cough [^111WXFgH]. Annals of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology (2007). Low credibility.

To review the available evidence on treating chronic cough, an evidence-based approach was relayed for the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough.

- **Data sources**: MEDLINE, PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL were searched using the following keywords: cough, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, sinusitis, rhinitis (allergic, seasonal), postnasal drip, vocal cord dysfunction, lung disease (interstitial), bronchiectasis, and bronchoscopy.

- **Study selection**: Studies were selected based on their relevance to the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough. Due to a lack of randomized prospective studies, nonrandomized and retrospective studies were considered, with their strengths and limitations noted.

- **Results**: Few randomized controlled trials have addressed the diagnosis and treatment of chronic cough. There are several prospective noncontrolled trials for adults with chronic cough that found a high percentage of cough resolution when using an approach focused on diagnosing and treating the most common causes: asthma, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and upper airway cough syndrome. Preliminary studies in children support an approach that distinguishes between a wet and dry cough, as well as an in-depth investigation of any specific symptoms that point to an underlying chronic illness.

- **Conclusion**: Allergists, as experts in treating upper airway and lower airway disorders, are uniquely poised to diagnose and treat chronic cough.

### AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease: Expert review [^1161MnkZ]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

When addressing gastroesophageal reflux disease, particularly in patients with extraesophageal symptoms, the AGA 2023 guidelines recommend developing a multidisciplinary approach to extraesophageal manifestations. These conditions are often multifactorial and require input from non-gastroenterology specialties. It is important to consider results from diagnostic tests, such as bronchoscopy, thoracic imaging, and laryngoscopy, from non-gastroenterology disciplines when gastroesophageal reflux is suspected as a cause for extraesophageal symptoms.

### Chronic cough: Evaluation and management [^1126Yakw]. American Family Physician (2017). High credibility.

Chronic cough can be associated with a variety of conditions and symptoms, including:

- **Respiratory conditions**: COPD, asthma, pulmonary eosinophilia, lung cancer, cystic fibrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis
- **Gastrointestinal and reflux-related symptoms**: Gastroesophageal reflux, heartburn, sour taste
- **Infections and other conditions**: Infection, aspiration pneumonia
- **Nasal and throat symptoms**: Runny nose, postnasal drip, sore throat, hoarseness
- **Other symptoms and factors**: Coughing up blood, wheezing, dyspnea, medication side effects, being female

### Chronic cough: Evaluation and management [^113jzXcQ]. American Family Physician (2017). Low credibility.

Although chronic cough in adults (lasting longer than eight weeks) can be caused by many etiologies, four conditions account for most cases: upper airway cough syndrome, gastroesophageal reflux disease/laryngopharyngeal reflux disease, asthma, and nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis. Patients should be evaluated clinically, using spirometry if indicated, and empiric treatment should be initiated. Other potential causes include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use, environmental triggers, tobacco use, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and obstructive sleep apnea. Chest radiography can rule out concerning infectious, inflammatory, and malignant thoracic conditions. Patients with refractory chronic cough may warrant referral to a pulmonologist or otolaryngologist, in addition to a trial of gabapentin, pregabalin, and/or speech therapy.

In children, cough is considered chronic if present for more than four weeks. In children aged six to 14 years, it is most commonly caused by asthma, protracted bacterial bronchitis, and upper airway cough syndrome. Evaluation should focus initially on these etiologies, with targeted treatment and monitoring for resolution.

### Managing chronic cough due to asthma and NAEB in adults and adolescents: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^116TEfuL]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

For managing specific circumstances of chronic cough, particularly in patients with non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, the ACCP 2020 guidelines recommend considering an increase in the dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs). If the response to ICSs is incomplete, a therapeutic trial of a leukotriene inhibitor should be initiated after reconsidering alternative causes of cough in adult and adolescent patients with chronic cough due to non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis.

### SIGN 158 British guideline on the management of asthma: A national clinical guideline [^115HUcnX]. SIGN (2019). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic investigations for asthma, specifically concerning the initial assessment, the BTS/SIGN 2019 guidelines recommend obtaining a structured clinical assessment to assess the initial probability of asthma based on:

- **Episodes of symptoms**: Ideally corroborated by variable peak flows when symptomatic and asymptomatic.

- **Symptoms of wheeze, cough, breathlessness, and chest tightness**: These should vary over time.

- **Recorded observation of wheeze**: This should be heard by a healthcare professional.

- **Personal or family history of other atopic conditions**: This includes atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis.

### AGA clinical practice update on the diagnosis and management of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease: expert review [^114iu2Zj]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2023). High credibility.

The purpose of this American Gastroenterological Association (AGA) Institute Clinical Practice Update is to review the available evidence and expert advice regarding the clinical management of patients with suspected extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease.

This article provides practical advice based on the available published evidence, including recent reviews from leading investigators in the field, prospective and population studies, clinical trials, and recent clinical guidelines and technical reviews. This best practice document is not based on a formal systematic review. The best practice advice applies to patients with symptoms or conditions suspected to be related to extraesophageal reflux (EER).

This expert review was commissioned and approved by the AGA Institute Clinical Practice Updates Committee (CPUC) and the AGA Governing Board to provide timely guidance on a topic of high clinical importance to the AGA membership. It underwent internal peer review by the CPUC and external peer review through standard procedures of Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology. These Best Practice Advice (BPA) statements were drawn from a review of the published literature and expert opinion. Because systematic reviews were not performed, these BPA statements do not carry formal ratings of the quality of evidence or the strength of the presented considerations.

- **Best practice advice 1**: Gastroenterologists should be aware of potential extraesophageal manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux.

### Somatically evoked cough responses help to identify patients with difficult-to-treat chronic cough: a six-month observational cohort study [^113m2az5]. EClinicalMedicine (2023). Low credibility.

The association between chronic cough and its commonest causes was established clinically and by using the results of recommended tests. Classic asthma was suspected when patients reported wheezing or chest tightness or both, with and without reversible airway obstruction. Gastro-oesophageal reflux was suspected when at least one oesophageal symptom was reported, with or without one or more of the commonest extra-oesophageal manifestations. Finally, an upper airway cough syndrome was suspected when patients reported nasal obstruction and/or post-nasal drip episodes with or without throat clearing.

In all instances, pharmacological treatments were recommended according to guidelines. Furthermore, patients received personalised lifestyle suggestions when appropriate. Treatments also included acid-suppressing drugs (proton pump inhibitors and antacid drugs often associated with prokinetic drugs, n = 95), inhaled/oral steroids associated with long-acting bronchodilators (n = 38), nasal lavages, and steroids and/or antihistamines (n = 21). Combinations of drugs were prescribed in the remaining 151 out of 317 patients due to the detection of multiple, putative cough-accompanying symptoms. In twelve patients (7 SPC+), cough was the sole clinically apparent disturbance, and they were treated with cough suppressants such as Gabapentin, central (Codeine) or peripheral (Levodropropizine) antitussive medicines. For each patient, three follow-up visits were scheduled approximately two months apart; however, it was possible to anticipate the end of the visits if necessary.

### The relationship between psychogenic cough and the diagnosis and misdiagnosis of asthma: a review [^112PvSyT]. The Journal of Asthma (2007). Low credibility.

The differential diagnoses of persistent nonproductive cough include numerous pulmonary and non-pulmonary organic disorders as well as functional illnesses. Many diseases can cause cough, and several studies have shown that asthma is among the most common etiologies associated with chronic cough in adult nonsmokers, as well as children. The relationship between psychogenic cough and asthma or other asthma-like illnesses is complex since distinct maladies with similar features may coexist individually or in combination in any given patient.

While chronic cough may occur as a sole presenting manifestation of bronchial asthma in all age groups, recent findings suggest that most children with persistent cough without other respiratory symptoms do not have asthma. Since several organic as well as functional diseases may present with persistent cough as their sole manifestation in either adults or children, cough should not be used as a single or major determinant to diagnose and treat asthma, especially when empirically focused therapy trials fail. Given the range of illnesses causing cough, no single management guideline can be expected to be universally effective.

### Updates to the modern diagnosis of GERD: Lyon consensus 2.0 [^111ssd36]. Gut (2024). Low credibility.

Troublesome typical symptoms alone may be enough for antisecretory medication trials, but up-front oesophageal testing is suggested for all other symptom categories and in proton pump inhibitor (PPI) non-responders, prior to invasive GERD management or long-term medical management.

Actionable GERD constitutes settings where management requires long-term acid suppression, an escalation of medical management, or consideration of interventional (i.e. not easily reversible) management options for GERD. These options may include laparoscopic fundoplication, magnetic sphincter augmentation (MSA), endoscopic GERD therapies, or bariatric surgery, where high confidence in GERD diagnosis is essential.

The Montreal consensus defines GERD as the reflux of stomach contents into the oesophagus, causing troublesome symptoms and/or complications. However, not all 'troublesome' symptoms can be directly linked to gastric content reflux, and symptoms alone are insufficient for a conclusive diagnosis. Nevertheless, the pragmatic continuation of empiric antisecretory therapy is considered appropriate when typical symptoms (heartburn, chest pain, regurgitation) improve with GERD treatment trials, although the response could also be due to the placebo effect. In parallel, assumptions of GERD relationships with cough, hoarseness, and other 'isolated' extraoesophageal symptoms (i.e. in the absence of typical GERD symptoms) have overestimated atypical GERD diagnoses. This leads to inappropriate use of antisecretory drugs, a high economic burden, and wasted limited testing resources.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^115r645A]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding the specific circumstances of gastroesophageal reflux disease, particularly in patients with extraesophageal symptoms, the ACG 2022 guidelines recommend avoiding the establishment of a diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux solely based on laryngoscopy findings. Instead, it is advised to consider obtaining additional testing.

### Expert consensus document: Advances in the physiological assessment and diagnosis of GERD [^117Pw8H4]. Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2017). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common condition worldwide. Key mechanisms of disease include abnormal oesophagogastric junction structure and function, and impaired oesophageal clearance. A therapeutic trial of acid-suppressive proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy is often the initial management, with endoscopy performed in the setting of alarm symptoms and to exclude other conditions. If symptoms persist and endoscopy does not reveal evidence of GERD, oesophageal function tests are performed, including oesophageal manometry and ambulatory reflux monitoring.

However, reflux episodes can be physiological, and some findings on endoscopy and manometry can be encountered in asymptomatic individuals without GERD symptoms. The diagnosis of GERD on the basis of functional oesophageal testing has been previously reported, but no updated expert recommendations on indications and the interpretation of oesophageal function testing in GERD have been made since the Porto consensus over a decade ago.

In this Consensus Statement, we aim to describe modern oesophageal physiological tests and their analysis with an emphasis on establishing indications and consensus on interpretation parameters of oesophageal function testing for the evaluation of GERD in clinical practice. This document reflects the collective conclusions of the international GERD working group, incorporating existing data with expert consensus opinion.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for gastroesophageal reflux disease, specifically in relation to upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, the ASGE 2025 guidelines recommend performing upper endoscopy in patients with GERD symptoms who present with alarm symptoms. These symptoms include dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding, persistent vomiting, or unexplained iron deficiency anemia.

### Omeprazole-induced cough in a patient with gastroesophageal reflux disease [^116AF5ip]. European Journal of Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2010). Low credibility.

Persistent cough could be caused by various diseases such as postnasal drip syndrome, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), or as an adverse event from drugs such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We report a case of persistent cough associated with high plasma levels of the proton pump inhibitor omeprazole in a patient with GERD. This case suggests cough as an adverse drug event to omeprazole, which is otherwise commonly prescribed for the management of GERD-related cough. Therefore, physicians should be aware of the onset or exacerbation of cough during omeprazole therapy.

### Postnasal drip [^112DKwhE]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology: In Practice (2024). Low credibility.

Postnasal drip (PND) is a common symptom encountered when evaluating subjects with sinonasal disease; it may also be present without sinonasal disease or as a symptom of laryngopharyngeal reflux. It is postulated that PND stems from dysfunction of normal mucus clearance mechanisms; however, there is no definitive evidence elucidating an exact pathophysiology. Compounding the uncertainties surrounding PND is the lack of an objective assessment tool. Instead, treating physicians must rely on subjective complaints, and investigators utilize validated patient-reported outcome instruments, such as the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test, to determine treatment efficacy. This review seeks to discuss the understanding of PND and evidence regarding effective treatment strategies.

### Symptomatic reflux disease: The present, the past and the future [^112q9abr]. Gut (2014). Low credibility.

Using oesophageal pH-impedance monitoring, four phenotypes of poorly responsive patients can be identified, each with unique management considerations.

- **Phenotype 4**: Patients of phenotype 4 are the most easily managed, as a diagnosis of GORD can be excluded, making antireflux therapy of little to no use.
- **Phenotype 3**: More complex are patients of phenotype 3, who experience excessive reflux, but without a temporal association between symptoms and reflux episodes. Technically, these patients have GORD; however, treatment may or may not alleviate their persistent symptoms. Patients with pulmonary and otolaryngology syndromes exemplify this phenotype, which is especially challenging due to the lack of high-level evidence supporting the effectiveness of any antireflux therapy.
- **Phenotype 2**: Patients demonstrate physiological evidence of GORD complicated by oesophageal hypersensitivity, reducing the effectiveness of conventional therapy. Although no high-level evidence exists for managing this group, there is anecdotal and mechanistic support for the addition of perception modulators.
- **Phenotype 1**: These patients possess physiological evidence of GORD, indicated by excessive reflux and a positive symptom association. They should derive benefits from alternative antireflux therapies, whether pharmacological or surgical.

pH-impedance monitoring enables the identification of subgroups of patients with symptoms suspected to be caused by reflux, based on the presence or absence of excessive reflux and the corresponding symptom association.

### Chronic upper airway cough syndrome secondary to rhinosinus diseases (previously referred to as postnasal drip syndrome): ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^1157cAAZ]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

To review the literature on postnasal drip syndrome (PNDS)-induced cough and the various causes of PNDS, it will henceforth be referred to as upper airway cough syndrome (UACS).

- **Methods**: A MEDLINE search was conducted through May 2004 for studies published in English since 1980 on human subjects. The search used medical subject heading terms including "cough", "causes of cough", "etiology of cough", "postnasal drip", "allergic rhinitis", "vasomotor rhinitis", and "chronic sinusitis". Case series and prospective descriptive clinical trials were selected for review. Additionally, references pertinent to the topic from these studies were obtained.

- **Results**: Multiple prospective, descriptive studies of adults indicate that PNDS, due to a variety of upper respiratory conditions, is the most common cause of chronic cough. This occurs either singly or in combination with other conditions. The symptoms and signs of PNDS are nonspecific, meaning a definitive diagnosis of PND-induced cough cannot be made from the medical history and physical examination findings alone. Furthermore, the absence of usual clinical findings does not rule out a response to treatment that is typically effective for PND-induced cough. The differential diagnosis of PNDS-induced cough includes allergic rhinitis, perennial nonallergic rhinitis, postinfectious rhinitis, bacterial sinusitis, allergic fungal sinusitis, rhinitis due to anatomic abnormalities, rhinitis due to physical or chemical irritants, occupational rhinitis, rhinitis medicamentosa, and rhinitis of pregnancy. Due to a high prevalence of up…

### Cough and gastroesophageal reflux: Identifying cough and assessing the efficacy of cough-modifying agents [^115DZ99s]. The American Journal of Medicine (2001). Low credibility.

From a symptom research standpoint, much has been learned about the management of cough in general, and cough caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease in particular. Yet, before further advances can be made in understanding how to best manage patients with this common symptom, methodologic challenges remain to be solved. One of the most basic is the development of valid and reliable methods by which to identify cough, assess its impact on patients, and assess the efficacy of cough therapies.

This review explores the characteristics of cough that relate to its assessment and how the effect of drug treatment on cough has been evaluated. Perspective is provided on evaluating the efficacy of cough-modifying agents, and the optimal method for identifying a cough and linking it with a reflux event.

Investigators should use both subjective and objective methods, as they have the potential to measure different aspects of cough. Subjective measures, such as cough-specific quality-of-life instruments, are likely to best reflect the severity of cough from the patient's standpoint. This is because a subjective response likely integrates both cough frequency and intensity. The ideal objective method should allow for automatic cough counting over 24 hours in an ambulatory setting. Although it is theoretically possible to design and construct such a device that is also relatively unobtrusive, reliable, and accurate, one is not yet available.

### Chronic cough due to gastroesophageal reflux in adults: Chest guideline and expert panel report [^116mmN88]. Chest (2016). Low credibility.

We updated the 2006 ACCP clinical practice guidelines for the management of reflux-cough syndrome.

- **Methods**: Two population, intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) questions were addressed by systematic review. The questions were: (1) Can therapy for gastroesophageal reflux improve or eliminate cough in adults with chronic and persistently troublesome cough? and (2) Are there minimal clinical criteria to guide practice in determining that chronic cough is likely to respond to therapy for gastroesophageal reflux?

- **Results**: We found no high-quality studies pertinent to either question. From available randomized controlled trials (RCTs) addressing question #1, we concluded that (1) there was a strong placebo effect for cough improvement; (2) studies including diet modification and weight loss had better cough outcomes; (3) although lifestyle modifications and weight reduction may be beneficial in suspected reflux-cough syndrome, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) demonstrated no benefit when used in isolation; and (4) because of the potential carryover effect, crossover studies using PPIs should be avoided. For question #2, we concluded from the available observational trials that (1) an algorithmic approach to management resolved chronic cough in 82% to 100% of instances; (2) cough variant asthma and upper airway cough syndrome (UACS) (previously referred to as postnasal drip syndrome) from rhinosinus conditions were the most commonly reported causes; and (3) the reported prevalence of reflux-cough syndrome varied widely.

- **Conclusions**: The panelists endorsed the use of a diagnostic/therapeutic approach to management, although the text appears to be incomplete here.

### Best practice in symptom assessment: A review [^112cedpR]. Gut (2004). Low credibility.

Assessment of symptoms is important both in the diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) and in monitoring response to therapeutic interventions. Key quality aims in assessing symptoms are to gather data that are valid, reliable, unbiased, discriminating, and responsive to change. Important considerations include who should assess symptoms, the method of data collection, timing of assessment, and methods of assessing multiple symptoms.

### Chronic cough and irritable larynx [^111bwC47]. The Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (2011). Low credibility.

Perennial rhinitis (PR), chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), or both, along with asthma and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), are the most frequent triggers of chronic cough (CC). Extrathoracic airway receptors might be involved in all three conditions because asthma is often associated with PR/CRS, and gastroesophageal refluxate might reach the upper airway. We previously found that most patients with rhinosinusitis, postnasal drip, and pharyngolaryngitis show laryngeal hyperresponsiveness (LHR), indicated by vocal cord adduction on histamine challenge, which is consistent with an irritable larynx.

- **Objective**: We sought to evaluate the role of LHR in patients with CC.

- **Methods**: LHR and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to histamine were assessed in 372 patients with CC and 52 asthmatic control subjects without cough (asthma/CC-). In 172 patients, the challenge was repeated after treatment for the underlying cause of cough.

- **Results**: The primary trigger of CC was PR/CRS in 208 (56%) patients, asthma in 41 (11%) patients (asthma/CC+), GERD in 62 (17%) patients, and unexplained chronic cough (UNEX) in 61 (16%) patients. LHR prevalence was 76% in patients with PR/CRS, 77% in patients with GERD, 66% in patients with UNEX, 93% in asthma/CC+ patients, and 11% in asthma/CC- patients. Upper airway disease was found in most (95%) asthma/CC+ patients and in 6% of asthma/CC- patients. BHR discriminated asthmatic patients, and atopy discriminated patients with PR/CRS from those with GERD and UNEX. Absence of LHR discriminated asthmatic patients without cough. After treatment, LHR resolved in 63% of cases.

### Controversies in the evaluation and management of chronic cough [^1118t5rV]. American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine (2011). Low credibility.

Chronic cough that cannot be explained after basic evaluation is a common reason for patients to be referred to respiratory outpatient clinics. Asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, and upper airway disorders frequently coexist with chronic cough. There is some controversy as to whether these conditions are causes or aggravants of cough. Heightened cough reflex sensitivity is an important feature in most patients. There is good evidence that it is reversible when associated with upper respiratory tract infection, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor medications, and chronic cough associated with eosinophilic airway inflammation. In many patients, heightened cough reflex sensitivity is persistent and their cough is unexplained. There are few therapeutic options for patients with unexplained chronic cough. There is a pressing need to understand the genetic, molecular, and physiological basis of unexplained chronic cough and to develop novel antitussive drugs that down-regulate cough reflex sensitivity.

### Managing chronic cough due to asthma and NAEB in adults and adolescents: CHEST guideline and expert panel report [^112Fobu6]. Chest (2020). High credibility.

For chronic cough management, particularly in patients with asthma, the ACCP 2020 guidelines recommend obtaining noninvasive measurements of airway inflammation in adult and adolescent patients with chronic cough due to asthma. Recognizing the presence of eosinophilic airway inflammation can be associated with a more favorable response to corticosteroids.

### Evaluation of the patient with chronic cough [^115GsoSY]. American Family Physician (2011). Low credibility.

Initial evaluation of the patient with chronic cough (i.e. of more than eight weeks' duration) should include a focused history and physical examination, and in most patients, chest radiography. Patients who are taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor should switch to a medication from another drug class. The most common causes of chronic cough in adults are upper airway cough syndrome, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease, alone or in combination. If upper airway cough syndrome is suspected, a trial of a decongestant and a first-generation antihistamine is warranted. The diagnosis of asthma should be confirmed based on clinical response to empiric therapy with inhaled bronchodilators or corticosteroids. Empiric treatment for gastroesophageal reflux disease should be initiated in lieu of testing for patients with chronic cough and reflux symptoms. Patients should avoid exposure to cough-evoking irritants, such as cigarette smoke. Further testing, such as high-resolution computed tomography, and referral to a pulmonologist may be indicated if the cause of chronic cough is not identified.

In children, a cough lasting longer than four weeks is considered chronic. The most common causes in children are respiratory tract infections, asthma, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. Evaluation of children with chronic cough should include chest radiography and spirometry.

### The role of ambulatory 24-hour esophageal manometry in clinical practice [^112wcJwq]. Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2020). Low credibility.

Chronic cough

Chronic cough accounts for an estimated 30 million clinical visits per year and poses a diagnostic challenge. Etiologies include upper airway disease, non-asthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis, drug side effects, postnasal drip, and GERD. The clinical question is whether symptoms of chronic cough in a specific patient are induced by reflux. Excessive reflux on pH monitoring or endoscopic signs of reflux esophagitis do not necessarily prove causality. Analyzing the temporal relationship between cough and reflux is necessary to investigate causality. Ambulatory manometry allows for identification of cough on tracings, enabling assessment of the reflux-cough sequence during prolonged reflux monitoring.

While acoustic cough markers can also be used, precise interpretation of the timing between cough episodes and reflux events is crucial. For instance, if a cough immediately follows reflux, it suggests that the cough may lead to reflux. Conversely, if the cough occurs a few seconds after the onset of reflux, it suggests reflux induces the cough. A question arises about the necessity of objectively recording cough events if a patient already reports symptoms in a diary. Many argue that objective recording is essential, as symptom reports may reflect patient compliance and be subject to bias. Additionally, there can be a delay of 30 seconds to a minute between symptom occurrence and documentation.

### Aspergillus tracheobronchitis with Birt-Hogg-Dubè syndrome as a rare cause of chronic cough [^114Ex55m]. BMC Pulmonary Medicine (2022). Low credibility.

Chronic cough, defined as a cough lasting for more than 8 weeks, is associated with asthma, eosinophilic bronchitis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or upper airway cough syndrome (postnasal drip). These were not the culprits in our patient, and multiple lung cysts suggested that an infectious condition might be responsible for his cough and expectoration.

In this patient, aspergillus tracheobronchitis (ATB) was the underlying cause. ATB is a chronic superficial infection of the lower respiratory tract caused by Aspergillus species, which are ubiquitous environmental organisms. Aspergillus infection depends upon the patient's local and systemic immune status and alterations in host tissues. It is a rare disease, accounting for 5% of cases in lung transplantation patients. There is no epidemiological data on the prevalence of ATB thus far. Accumulating evidence has shown that Aspergillus affects individuals with pulmonary structural abnormalities, such as bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis. Despite no obvious signs of bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis seen in our patient, he had Birt-Hogg-Dubè (BHD) syndrome, a rare autosomal dominant disorder with diffuse lung cysts.

The impaired airway structure attenuated local defense functions and increased opportunistic infections. Whereas the normal immune function of this patient could prevent the spread of infection and substantially contributed to the localization of the disease, which was likely to be an important explanation of Aspergillus infection confined in the tracheobronchial tree, not the lung. This pulmonary structural destruction might be an important risk factor.

### Cough and throat clearing: Atypical GERD symptoms or not GERD at all [^116VC6NR]. Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology (2015). Low credibility.

The goal of this study was to investigate the frequency of throat clearing (TC) and cough and their association with a positive symptom index (SI) for reflux.

Many patients referred to our esophageal laboratory for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) evaluation present with "atypical" or "extraesophageal" symptoms. We reviewed ambulatory impedance-pH studies of 267 patients referred for evaluation of possible GERD symptoms from January 2012 to December 2013. The objective was to evaluate the frequency of cough, TC, and their association with an abnormal number of reflux episodes. Patients with fewer than three symptom events per 24 hours were excluded. Additional analysis was conducted for those with 24 or more (excessive) symptoms of TC or cough per 24 hours. Notably, 80% of patients were tested while on proton pump inhibitor therapy. The SI for either or both symptoms was calculated.

A total of 112 out of 267 patients (42%) reported both TC and cough on the study day, 76 out of 267 (28%) reported cough without TC, and 79 out of 267 (30%) reported TC without cough. Only 9 out of 112 (8%) had a positive SI, compared with 20 out of 76 (26%) and 17 out of 79 (22%) for cough (P = 0.0006) and TC (P = 0.007), respectively.

A total of 136 of 267 patients (51%) reported 3 to 23 TC events per 24 hours; 27 out of 136 (20%) had a positive SI. Among those with "excessive" TC, 55 of 267 (20%) had a positive SI, of which only 7 out of 55 (13%) had a positive SI (P = 0.24).

For cough, 142 out of 267 patients (53%) reported 3 to 23 cough events per 24 hours; 43 out of 142 (30%) had a positive SI. Among those with "excessive" cough, 46 out of 267 (17%) reported excessive events, with only 6 out of 46 (13%) having a positive SI (P = 0.02).

Analyses based on ON/OFF therapy also showed the same low rate of positive test results.

### Updates to the modern diagnosis of GERD: Lyon consensus 2.0 [^112vBmKr]. Gut (2024). High credibility.

The Lyon Consensus provides conclusive criteria for and against the diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and includes adjunctive metrics that consolidate or refute a GERD diagnosis when primary criteria are borderline or inconclusive. An international core and working group was assembled to evaluate research since the publication of the original Lyon Consensus and to vote on collaboratively developed statements to update criteria. The Lyon Consensus 2.0 provides a modern definition of actionable GERD, where evidence from oesophageal testing supports revising, escalating, or personalising GERD management for the symptomatic patient. It describes symptoms that have a high versus low likelihood of relating to reflux episodes and defines diagnostic strategies and testing options for unproven versus proven GERD.

Patients with no prior GERD evidence (unproven GERD) are studied using prolonged wireless pH monitoring or catheter-based pH or pH-monitoring off antisecretory medication. In contrast, patients with conclusive GERD evidence (proven GERD) and persisting symptoms are evaluated using pH-impedance monitoring while on optimised antisecretory therapy. Major changes from the original Lyon Consensus criteria include the establishment of Los Angeles grade B oesophagitis as conclusive GERD evidence, the description of metrics and thresholds to be used with prolonged wireless pH monitoring, and the inclusion of parameters useful in diagnosing refractory GERD when testing is performed on antisecretory therapy in proven GERD.

### Does my patient still have reflux when PPI therapy does not work [^114st9zL]? Neurogastroenterology and Motility (2017). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common condition worldwide. The management of this disease is often unsatisfactory due to the complexity of patient presentation and suboptimal diagnostic testing employed for those poorly responsive to acid suppressive therapy. In this mini review, we discuss new strategies for patients with suspected GERD to better understand disease pathophysiology. We compare these strategies and outline a clinically relevant approach for this difficult group of patients.

### Prevalence, pathogenesis, and causes of chronic cough [^117K6qX3]. Lancet (2008). Low credibility.

Cough is a reflex action of the respiratory tract that is used to clear the upper airways. Chronic cough, lasting for more than 8 weeks, is common in the community. The causes include cigarette smoking, exposure to cigarette smoke, and exposure to environmental pollution, especially particulates. Diseases causing chronic cough include asthma, eosinophilic bronchitis, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, postnasal drip syndrome or rhinosinusitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary fibrosis, and bronchiectasis. Doctors should always work towards a clear diagnosis, considering common and rare illnesses. In some patients, no cause is identified, leading to the diagnosis of idiopathic cough. Chronic cough is often associated with an increased response to tussive agents such as capsaicin.

Plastic changes in intrinsic and synaptic excitability in the brainstem, spine, or airway nerves can enhance the cough reflex, and can persist in the absence of the initiating cough event. Structural and inflammatory airway mucosal changes in non-asthmatic chronic cough could represent the cause or the traumatic response to repetitive coughing. Effective control of cough requires not only controlling the disease causing the cough but also desensitization of cough pathways.

### Postinfectious cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^114iQQJf]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

Patients who complain of a persistent cough lasting more than three weeks after experiencing the acute symptoms of an upper respiratory tract infection may have a postinfectious cough. Such patients are considered to have a subacute cough because the condition lasts for no more than eight weeks. The chest radiograph findings are normal, ruling out pneumonia, and the cough eventually resolves, usually on its own. The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of postinfectious cough, including the most virulent form caused by Bordetella pertussis infection, and to make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice.

- **Methods**: Recommendations were obtained using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, performed in August 2004, of literature published in English. The search was limited to human studies, using the terms "cough", "postinfectious cough", "postviral cough", "Bordetella pertussis", "pertussis infection", and "whooping cough".

- **Results**: The pathogenesis of postinfectious cough is not known, but it is thought to be due to extensive inflammation and disruption of upper and/or lower airway epithelial integrity. When postinfectious cough emanates from the lower airway, it is often associated with an excessive amount of mucus hypersecretion and/or transient airway and cough receptor hyperresponsiveness; all may contribute to the subacute cough. In these patients, the optimal treatment is not known.

### Increasing yield also increases false positives and best serves to exclude GERD [^112EkqKS]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2006). Low credibility.

Multiple diagnostic tests always improve diagnostic yield. However, with the addition of more true positives come more false positives. Therefore, positive predictive values likely decrease with additional testing. We show this is true even when no gold standard exists to verify the dual testing's sensitivity and specificity.

### Updates to the modern diagnosis of GERD: Lyon consensus 2.0 [^1173WF74]. Gut (2024). Low credibility.

The Lyon Consensus provides conclusive criteria for and against the diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and adjunctive metrics that consolidate or refute GERD diagnosis when primary criteria are borderline or inconclusive. An international core and working group was assembled to evaluate research since the publication of the original Lyon Consensus and to vote on collaboratively developed statements to update the criteria.

Symptoms that have a high versus low likelihood of being related to reflux episodes are described. Unproven versus proven GERD define diagnostic strategies and testing options. Patients with no prior GERD evidence (unproven GERD) are studied using prolonged wireless pH monitoring or catheter-based pH monitoring off antisecretory medication, while patients with conclusive GERD evidence (proven GERD) and persisting symptoms are evaluated using pH-impedance monitoring while on optimized antisecretory therapy.

The major changes from the original Lyon Consensus criteria include the establishment of Los Angeles grade B oesophagitis as conclusive GERD evidence, the description of metrics and thresholds to be used with prolonged wireless pH monitoring, and the inclusion of parameters useful in the diagnosis of refractory GERD when testing is performed on antisecretory therapy in proven GERD. Criteria that have not performed well in the diagnosis of actionable GERD have been revised accordingly.

### Investigation of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease [^115ryckh]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

Data suggest that patients who suffer from both asthma and GERD should be treated with antireflux medications. The initial empiric trial of twice daily PPIs for 2–3 months is recommended, and then treatment should be adjusted to the minimal dose necessary to control symptoms. For those unresponsive to this initial approach, combined impedance-pH monitoring should be performed "on" therapy to detect patients with persistent acid reflux or non-acid reflux. Patients with difficult-to-treat asthma and/or nocturnal symptoms without typical reflux symptoms should be investigated "off" therapy. This investigation may help detect patients with pathological reflux and evaluate the temporal correlation between reflux events and respiratory symptoms. To conclude, one should be cautious to delineate the subgroup of asthmatic patients who may benefit from acid suppressive medication or surgical fundoplication, and future trials are needed to better identify the GERD and asthma association.

### Validated clinical score to predict gastroesophageal reflux in patients with chronic laryngeal symptoms: COuGH RefluX [^116CViAC]. Clinical Gastroenterology and Hepatology (2024). High credibility.

Discerning whether laryngeal symptoms result from gastroesophageal reflux is clinically challenging, and a reliable tool to stratify patients is needed. We aimed to develop and validate a model to predict the likelihood of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) among patients with chronic laryngeal symptoms.

- **Methods**: This multicenter international study collected data from adults with chronic laryngeal symptoms who underwent objective testing (upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and/or ambulatory reflux monitoring) between March 2018 and May 2023. The training phase identified a model with optimal receiver operating characteristic curves, and β coefficients informed a weighted model. The validation phase assessed performance characteristics of the weighted model.

- **Results**: A total of 856 adults, 304 in the training cohort and 552 in the validation cohort, were included. In the training phase, the optimal predictive model (area under the curve, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.62–0.74) was the Cough, Overweight/obesity, Globus, Hiatal Hernia, Regurgitation, and male seX (COuGH RefluX) score, with a lower threshold of 2.5 and an upper threshold of 5.0 to predict proven GERD. In the validation phase, the COuGH RefluX score had an area under the curve of 0.67 (95% CI, 0.62–0.71), with 79% sensitivity and 81% specificity for proven GERD.

- **Conclusions**: The externally validated COuGH RefluX score is a clinically practical model to predict the likelihood of proven GERD. The score classifies most patients with chronic laryngeal symptoms as having a low/high likelihood of proven GERD.

### Updates to the modern diagnosis of GERD: Lyon consensus 2.0 [^1176DC9W]. Gut (2024). High credibility.

The Lyon Consensus proposes conclusive criteria for and against the diagnosis of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and adjunctive metrics that either consolidate or refute the GERD diagnosis when primary criteria are inconclusive. New published research indicates that testing strategies and thresholds differ when investigating patients with unproven versus proven GERD. The definition of GERD needed to be updated following improved specificity of diagnostic testing. As ROME V diagnostic criteria are being developed for oesophageal disorders of gut-brain interaction (DGBI), specific criteria for diagnosis and exclusion of GERD were needed that were consistent with emerging research. An update of the original Lyon Consensus is essential and timely.

The update of the Lyon Consensus seeks to improve the specificity of the modern diagnosis of GERD, to make oesophageal diagnostic algorithms congruent for identification of conclusive GERD, and for exclusion of GERD when favoring DGBI or other oesophageal disorders. Additionally, Lyon Consensus 2.0 defines GERD considering recent evidence, describes 'actionable' GERD where evidence from oesophageal testing supports revising, escalating, or personalizing GERD management, and identifies symptoms that have a high versus low likelihood of pathophysiological relationship to reflux episodes.

### American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline on the diagnosis and management of GERD: Summary and recommendations [^115jVrQN]. Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (2025). High credibility.

Regarding diagnostic procedures for gastroesophageal reflux disease, specifically concerning upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, the ASGE 2025 guidelines recommend a careful endoscopic evaluation. Reporting and photo-documentation should be obtained for the following in patients undergoing endoscopic evaluation for GERD symptoms to improve care and outcomes:

- **Objective GERD findings**: When present, identify erosive esophagitis using the Los Angeles grading system, Barrett's esophagus using the Prague classification, and peptic stricture.

- **GEJ landmarks and integrity**: Assess hiatal hernia dimensions using Hill grading or America Foregut Society grading in forward view and retroflexion. Document the location of the top of gastric folds, Z line, diaphragmatic impression, and describe any existing fundoplication if present.

### ACG clinical guideline for the diagnosis and management of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^116na89S]. The American Journal of Gastroenterology (2022). High credibility.

Regarding specific circumstances for gastroesophageal reflux disease, more specifically in patients with extraesophageal symptoms: ACG 2022 guidelines recommend performing upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, ideally off PPIs for 2–4 weeks, if patients with extraesophageal symptoms have not responded to a trial of twice-daily PPIs. Consider obtaining reflux monitoring if the endoscopy is normal.

### Moexipril hydrochloride [^112rLCmQ]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (2024). High credibility.

Persistent nonproductive cough, likely due to the inhibition of the degradation of endogenous bradykinin, has been reported with all ACE inhibitors and always resolves after discontinuation of therapy. ACE inhibitor-induced cough should be considered in the differential diagnosis of cough. In controlled trials with moexipril, cough was present in 6.1% of moexipril patients and 2.2% of patients given placebo.

- **Information for patients**: Patients should be advised to take moexipril one hour before meals.

- **Angioedema**: Angioedema, including laryngeal edema, may occur with treatment with ACE inhibitors, usually occurring early in therapy (within the first month). Patients should be advised to report immediately any signs or symptoms of angioedema (such as swelling of the face, extremities, eyes, lips, tongue, or difficulty in breathing) and to stop taking moexipril hydrochloride until consulting with the prescribing physician.

- **Symptomatic hypotension**: Patients should be cautioned that lightheadedness can occur with moexipril hydrochloride, especially during the first few days of therapy. If fainting occurs, the patient should stop taking moexipril hydrochloride and consult the prescribing physician. Patients should also be informed that excessive perspiration and dehydration may lead to an excessive fall in blood pressure due to a reduction in fluid volume. Other causes of volume depletion, such as vomiting or diarrhea, may also lead to a fall in blood pressure.

### Assessing old and new diagnostic tests for gastroesophageal reflux disease [^113Xnyai]. Gastroenterology (2018). Low credibility.

A detailed critique of objective measurements of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) would improve management of patients suspecting of having reflux, leading to rational selection of treatment and better outcomes. Many diagnostic tests for GERD have been developed over the past decades. We analyze their development, positive- and negative-predictive values, and ability to predict response to treatment. These features are important for development of medical, surgical, and endoscopic therapies for GERD. We discuss the value of available diagnostic tests and review their role in management of patients with persistent reflux symptoms despite adequate medical or surgical treatment. This is becoming a significant health economic problem due to the widespread use of proton pump inhibitors. GERD is believed to cause nonesophageal symptoms, such as those provoked by ear, nose, throat, or respiratory disorders. We analyze the value of GERD diagnostic tests in evaluation of these troublesome, nonesophageal symptoms.

### GERD in 2010: Diagnosis, novel mechanisms of disease and promising agents [^113EZ7Dn]. Nature Reviews. Gastroenterology & Hepatology (2011). Low credibility.

The results of various studies from 2010 have underlined the importance of the careful diagnostic assessment of GERD. Recent studies have also provided further evidence of the complex pathogenesis of GERD, and promising agents targeting the underlying factors in the pathogenesis of this condition are in the pipeline, especially for treatment-refractory GERD.

### Evaluation of gastroesophageal reflux disease [^111cj12s]. World Journal of Surgery (2017). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may present with heartburn, regurgitation, dysphagia, chronic cough, laryngitis, or even asthma. The clinical presentation of GERD is therefore varied and poses certain challenges to the physician, especially given the limitations of the diagnostic testing.

- **Discussion**: The evaluation of patients with suspected GERD might be challenging. It is based on the evaluation of clinical features, objective evidence of reflux on diagnostic testing, correlation of symptoms with episodes of reflux, evaluation of anatomical abnormalities, and excluding other causes that might account for the presence of the patient's symptoms.

- **Conclusions**: The diagnostic evaluation should include multiple tests, in addition to a thorough clinical examination.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease and aerodigestive disorders [^112UAqj3]. Current Problems in Pediatric and Adolescent Health Care (2018). Low credibility.

The relationship between gastroesophageal reflux and airway disorders is complex, potentially bidirectional, and not clearly defined. The tools used to investigate gastroesophageal reflux primarily provide information about its involvement within the gastrointestinal tract, although they are frequently employed to study the possible relationship between gastroesophageal reflux and airway issues suspected to occur in connection with reflux. These modalities often lack specificity for reflux-related airway disorders.

The co-incidence of gastroesophageal reflux and airway disorders does not necessarily imply causality. While much of the focus has been on managing acidity, controlling refluxate is an area that has not been traditionally aggressively pursued. The management approach is based on some of the evidence presented but often stems from a lack of adequate studies to provide further guidance.

### Allergic and hypersensitivity conditions in non-specialist care: Flow diagrams to support clinical practice [^114RFjqb]. Allergy (2022). Low credibility.

The asthma logogram consists of one schematic flow diagram comprising two steps: assessing probability based on clinical history and physical examination (Figure 1); and diagnosis depending on probability and availability of tests (Figure 2). As asthma is a long-term condition, there is no need to rush into the diagnosis. The diagnosis needs careful consideration, as long-standing, sometimes lifelong treatment is required. Although spirometry is an important element in the diagnosis of asthma, clinical suspicion, based on careful history taking, is the initial step in building the jigsaw. Many guidelines are based upon the availability of spirometry. Unfortunately, spirometry and bronchodilator and/or hyperreactivity testing is not accessible everywhere. As an alternative, two weeks of peak-flow measurements can be considered.

- **Assess the probability of asthma**: In low-probability cases based on the symptoms, history, and physical examination, alternative diagnoses should be considered. These alternatives are available by hovering over the gray buttons (hover box) in the Asthma Annex Appendix S1 before additional testing.

- **Diagnostic route based on probability and availability of investigations**: Spirometry is always preferred as the next step. However, based on the probability of asthma, initial treatment with inhaled corticosteroids (with or without fast-acting long-acting beta2-agonists) can be used in patients with a high probability where spirometry is not available. It is desirable to accompany treatment initiation with peak flow charting and symptom recording.

### Gastroesophageal reflux disease: A review [^116289iV]. JAMA (2020). Low credibility.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is defined by recurrent and troublesome heartburn and regurgitation, or GERD-specific complications, and affects approximately 20% of the adult population in high-income countries.

- **Observations**: GERD can influence patients' health-related quality of life and is associated with an increased risk of esophagitis, esophageal strictures, Barrett esophagus, and esophageal adenocarcinoma. Obesity, tobacco smoking, and genetic predisposition increase the risk of developing GERD. Typical GERD symptoms are often sufficient to determine the diagnosis, but less common symptoms and signs, such as dysphagia and chronic cough, may occur. Patients with typical GERD symptoms can be medicated empirically with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Among patients who do not respond to such treatment, or if the diagnosis is unclear, endoscopy, esophageal manometry, and esophageal pH monitoring are recommended. Patients with GERD symptoms combined with warning symptoms of malignancy (e.g. dysphagia, weight loss, bleeding) and those with other main risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma, such as older age, male sex, and obesity, should undergo endoscopy. Lifestyle changes, medication, and surgery are the main treatment options for GERD. Weight loss and smoking cessation are often useful. Medication with a PPI is the most common treatment, and after initial full-dose therapy, which usually is omeprazole 20 mg once daily, the aim is to use the lowest effective dose. Observational studies have suggested several adverse effects after long-term PPI use.

### Overview of common causes of chronic cough: ACCP evidence-based clinical practice guidelines [^116jexAF]. Chest (2006). Low credibility.

The objective of this study was to review the literature on the most common causes of chronic cough.

- **Methods**: MEDLINE was searched (through May 2004) for studies published in English since 1980 on human subjects using the medical subject heading terms "cough", "causes of cough", and "etiology of cough". Case series and prospective descriptive clinical trials were selected for review. Additionally, any pertinent references from these studies were obtained.

- **Results**: Upper airway cough syndrome (UACS) due to various rhinosinus conditions, previously known as postnasal drip syndrome, asthma, nonasthmatic eosinophilic bronchitis (NAEB), and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) are identified as the most common causes of chronic cough. Each of these diagnoses may appear alone or in combination and may be clinically silent apart from the cough itself.

- **Conclusion**: In the absence of evidence for another disorder, an approach focused on detecting the presence of UACS, asthma, NAEB, or GERD, either alone or in combination, is likely to yield better results than routinely searching for relatively uncommon or obscure diagnoses.

### Investigation of extraesophageal gastroesophageal reflux disease [^112KpuDK]. Annals of Gastroenterology (2013). Low credibility.

The most common extraesophageal manifestations of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) include chronic cough, asthma, and laryngitis. There are two mechanisms proposed to explain extraesophageal syndromes caused by GERD: the first is a direct route via irritation and/or microaspiration, and the second is an indirect, vagally mediated route. The investigation of extraesophageal manifestations of GERD is difficult, and empirical therapy with proton pump inhibitors, usually at double doses for at least three months, is still the most common approach.
